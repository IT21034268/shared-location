3,Mediocre,"Adequate, but be careful with your fill choice. Once you get it filled and tuck in the zipper, you'll never be able to get it back open to add more fill or to change it out. Still, it's ok for the price."
3,"nothing special, but it does the job","Cheaper then the similar size Caldwell rest, yet still does the same job. I am using it with the rock front rest and together they work fine. However when I use it with my AR I find the rear rest isn't high enough to allow the 30 cap magazine to be used . The solution was to raise the rear rest by 4 inches. I also needed to turn the rock 180 degrees so as to eliminate the rear leg from making contact with the magazine."
3,Worked out in the end with additional purchase,"This product is a ""Learn"" receiver. While its nice and small, it was not what i was looking for. I was looking for a 318mhz remote for my garage that had the +,-,&0 switches but that problem was solved after purchasing a new 318mhz receiver but for two doors you must buy two single channels or 1 multi channel. The receiver had a learn button which was compatible with the remote. Still Was only a total of $48 with shipping for me so it was still relative to prices in stores."
5,The music is great.,"I am a collector of soundtracks, and bought this. This is a great CD. I enjoyed every bit of it. You can create a different version of the Alamo, while listening to this. I give it a 10 out of 10."
3,song title help,what is the name of the song that the Mexican army plays each night before they artillery fire? The song where Crocket plays the violin to one night when the artillery doesn't fire that night. I thought it might be Deguello but listening to other samples of that song does not sound the same. Thanks for your help
1,Didn't Last Long,"I have owned several latch hooks over the years and not a single one has ever broken on me so fast. After only 4 days of using this one, the latch actually fell out in the middle of my working on my rug. I had to have a friend ship me my old one just to finish the rug in time for Christmas. Maybe I just got a shoddy one, but I would buy one straight from Caron again, not this one."
1,No luck with this,I've been using this for a few weeks. Doesn't work nearly as well as Placque Blast which surprised me when it worked.
2,Review for Petzlife Oral care Spray,This product came recommended by a friend so I didn't really check previous reviews. I have a greyhound and tried to use this product on her once. She became sick with an hour! Grey's can be very sensitive but I was surprised by the fact that there did seem to be quite a lot of grain alcohol. It is the second ingredient after distilled water.Very disappointed since this product is said to really work. Can't imagine that grain alcohol is very good for your dog even if she doesn't have a sensitive tummy.There must be a better product out there for those of us whose dogs just won't tolerate having the tooth brush.
4,"Didn't work for me, but still worth a shot.","After reading all the reviews for this product I was pretty excited about having found a miracle fix for my dog's gingivitis. I adopted an ex-racing greyhound in May of 2010 and, while her teeth don't really look too bad, she does seem to have some red and swollen gums. I had hoped that this product would alleviate that situation without having to go through the dangers (and $500 expense!) of a professional cleaning. Well, I guess that's not really what this product is for because after about 5 weeks of use as directed I haven't really seen any improvement.Still, the other reviews would indicate that this stuff works GREAT for lots of other dogs, so don't let this review discourage you. It is definitely worth a shot, and my dog actually kind of likes the stuff too. Of course, she eats poop, so I'm not sure that she is a reliable taste tester."
5,A great product!,This spray worked with results the first time I used it. My dogs teeth were very bad and he is almost 14 years old. There was no way I would allow him to be put out to have his teeth cleaned. I saw this product and decided to try it. What a difference it made! Will continue to buy and use this product.
1,a NO-NO for my 14 year old dog,"My dog HATED this and wouldn't eat or drink after being treated. She also was in pain. After a baby aspirin , she did drink some beef broth, By the next day, she was herself again. The vet said she probably had an upset stomach, either from the spray, the toothpaste or both. Thank goodness, she's fine now, but I will NEVER use these products again. I'd rather have her smelly breath rather than see her in so much pain!!!"
3,Works ok but dog dont like,This does seem to help a little but to be honest my lil chihuahua doesnt like it and bites my fingers when I try and spray it. I used pretty solidly for 2 weeks then once every 3 or 4 days. Its ok but this really should be used with brushing thier teeth also. My bigger dog lets me spray it in her mouth with no problems. So I suggest for bigger dogs but maybe not for smaller dogs with small mouths they dont seem to like it. Well mine doesnt.
2,Not as easy or effective as water additives,"Tried this for a while, requires multiple-times-daily-diligence to have an appreciable effect.I found it much easier to buy the liquid you add to your pet's water dish and that stuff works great."
2,petzlife rating,(NEW) If I had kept the original packaging I would have sent this product back. The container says 2.2 ounces and was disappointed to find it appears to contain a lot less. Anyway I have used the product but do not have a positive result to indicate it will do as advertised. I had not read reviews on this product before purchasing but hopefully others found it to work. I would not purchase it again.
1,total waste of money.,didn't do a thing for our bichon. such a waste of money. our vet agreed. and couldn't return it in the end.
1,Essential oils are toxic to cats,"I would not use this product on cats, since most essential oils including thyme oil and peppermint oil are toxic to cats. The active ingredient appears to be alcohol, you may as well spray vodka in your pet's mouth it will be cheaper and just as effective, the essential oils are to make breath smell nice for humans... but will slowly poison your cat."
3,Not sure yet,"THis has great reviews, but my dogs HATES having this sprayed in his mouth. I don't think it is the taste, but the actual spraying is the bad thing. So, I've been lax on using it and can't report how well it works. I think the gel version may have been a better choice."
3,Its Okay,My dogs didnt enjoy this spray and it could be due to the nozzle. I think the spray comes out too fast and they just couldnt get used to it. Not sure if I saw a difference either.
2,Pet oral spray...,I did not like this product because it did not work as well as the manufacturer stated that it would.
2,I didn't notice any difference...,"We used this just as recommended and I honestly don't think it did a thing. Unfortunately there is no ""magic pill"" for fighting plaque."
2,might work,Read the reviews and bought some for my Shi Tzu. He hated it sprayed in his mouth and after 5 days had a bad reaction to it. GI upset. Stopped using it and after a couple days he was ok. Might try using it again by spraying it on his paws and he licks it off; will only give every other day or so and see what happens. Would like this to work but at least with my dog it is a problem.
4,Does its job when used consistently.,"I have a small Yorkie who had bad tarter on his teeth and awful, awful breath. I didn't want to do the professional cleaining due to the cost and fear of putting such a small dog under anethesia. I decided to try this first, I used it twice a day for a month and noticed that quite a bit of the tarter was gone and his breath had improved. He's a dog so he always has some bad breath but this helped so that I could stand to be close to him. I would say it removed 75% of his tarter.When I stopped using it regularly then I noticed the tarter piled up again and when I dont use it consistently it doesn't help much, so if you have the time and memory to use the spray at least twice a day this is a great alternative to a professional teeth cleaning."
3,It's Okay,"I bought this in adition to brushing my dog's teeth. Even though I brush my dog's teeth 5 times a week, he still has some staining on his back teeth. There is nothing better than brushing a dog's teeth. Did it work? I'm not sure. It did help keep his breath fresh. This would be better than nothing. I probably won't be buying this again."
4,Works on my Chihuahua,"My little guy has some of the worst breath. Even though this product didn't clear that up, it did clear up his tartar. We aren't the best at spraying him consistently, but this still has cleaned up his teeth quite a bit. I expect with continued use and a more everyday treatment, he will be looking great. Not sure it will help his breath, but it might. He doesn't particularly like the actual event of the spraying, but right afterwards he is fine. We have never seen him have any type of reaction at all to it. I would recommend you give this a try if your dog has tartar build up and don't want to risk having them put under for a teeth cleaning."
5,outstanding results,"THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. DECIEDED TO TRY THIS BEFORE SPENDING $200 FOR THE VET TO CLEAN MY DOGS TEETH. WAS RELUCTANT TO HAVE THIS PROCEDURE DONE AS I HAVE HAD FRIENDS WHO LOST PETS DOING THIS. WELL, A COUPLE OF SQUIRTS A FEW TIMES A WEEK, AND RESULTS ARE AMAZING. HARDLY ANY BUILD-UP ON HER TEETH AND HER BREATH IS SWEET AGAIN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE . THIS IS ONE SUPER PRODUCT."
2,"Didnt work much, take dog to vet","It works,.but not great. Please dont use this as replacement for veteranary clinic. If your pet has very bad breath they may have serious issues and could cause problems with their organs. what bothers me is they are coming off like a few sprays a week the animal never needs regular brushing. I also have full kit of picks to remove plaque, but you have to be careful with those. At least brush 3 to 4 times a week. the lack of Brushing will cause build up of bacteria over time and that will get in bloodstrean. Many animals live half thier life from this. Both Vet and at home,.keep their teeth clean!"
5,great product,My vet wanted $695 to clean my dog's teeth. I decided to try Petzlife. It was amazing how well it took off tarter! It really works. Thanks Petzlife for a great product.
4,Doggie Oral Spray,This oral spray is much better than the gel for my dog. He is not crazy about being sprayed in the mouth area but he is getting used to it and the product seems to be making an improvement for him. Time will tell.
4,Easy to use,Bought the peppermint spray and gel. My dog dosen't mind either but she is used to having her teeth brushed. I tried the gel mild taste not unpleasant. I have only had for about ten days so I don't know how effective it will be but high points for ease of use and price.
5,Good stuff,Both the spray and gel are great products. Really does deliver on its claims! The gel is easier for me to use on my dog because her mouth is small. The spray is harder to get in there. Spray is less messy because you don't have to stick your finger in your dogs mouth. Great product.
3,"Looked promising but, my pet came down with a UTI","Used the product about 3 or 4 times and it seemed to be having a good effect. Her teeth were definiately whiter and seemed cleaner. However, my 2 1/2 year old Jack Russel came down with a UTI and had to be put on antibiotics. Not sure if there is a connection, but felt I should stop using the products since it was the only thing that we had introduced to her prior to the UTI. Just putting this out there in case anyone else has a similar experience with their pet. Otherwise like I said before, it sure seemed to be working."
2,Should have puchased gel??,"I thought the spray would be easier to administer, but it startles my dog (who is not easily scared) and he seems to hate the taste. I'm thinking the gel may have been easier to use."
1,Dog can't stand it,"My German Shepherd tolerates having her teeth brushed, but she doesn't love it, so I thought I'd try this. Unfortunately, she hates this even more than she hates having her teeth brushed! When she sees the spray bottle, she runs in the other direction and refuses to open her mouth. Maybe this works for some dogs, but it was a waste of money for mine."
4,review,cleans teeth my mild mannered dog lets me use it ... cat won't and bites my hand extra word extra word ... silly to have 20 minimum word count !!!
2,Sprayer doesn't work,"I can't say much about the effectiveness of this product because I haven't been using it with my dogs for long. The first sprayer ran out pretty fast with two large dogs (as it should have). The second sprayer just doesn't work. If you're gonna sell a spray product, I think you should make dang sure the sprayer works. Without a spray, this liquid is useless."
2,Alcohol Really!,"If you think grain alcohol is an ingredient that you want in your pets mouth then please order this.Sure it covers odor and cleans somewhat but would it not do the same to your car engine. I don'tknow why I purchased this because I had read that it had grain alcohol in it. If you love yourpet as much as it loves you,find a product with natural ingredients to use,or take your pet tothe vet and have its teeth cleaned."
1,Peppermint to strong,My dogs did not like this product as the peppermint that they used is way to strong.I only used it once so I do not know if this product works to clean their teeth.
2,Wondering if this does anything,"Arrived quickly, but the first thing I had to do was scrape the bar code stickeroff the bottle because it completely covered the instructions. That was a pain.When finally revealed, the last statement in those instructions: ""Brushing every third day enchances results."" DUH! IF we all brushed our dog's teeth every 3 days, we wouldn't need a product like this, would we? So, I'll try this stuff; but......"
5,This really work!!,I had my reservations when I purchased this spray on plaque remover. Well not anymore. I use it only once a day on my two little dogs and the results are great. I recommed this highly.
4,seems to work,"My dog doesn't like this being sprayed in his mouth, but it does seem to be removing that tartar build up from his teeth"
4,"so far, so good","My dog's breath has improved somewhat since I started spraying his teeth( I got the spray a week ago). There is no noticeable change in the tartar levels so far, though."
2,Not very impressed,"I saw no results or changes from using this product, it doesn't work as advertised. My dog didn't mind it too much although he didn't seem to love it either."
3,Costly and barely works,"Ive used the product for nearly a month, it really hasnt improved my dogs breath. Not so sure it compares to lesser priced products"
3,"Good product, mediocre delivery system","PetzLife Oral Care Spray seems to work on bad breath when your dog cooperates in allowing it to be sprayed into its mouth (it is too soon to see any positive effect on plaque build up).However, the delivery system of a pump spray makes it difficult to spray into a dog's mouth when you turn it away from a vertical position (think about it....the end of the intake straw inside the bottle is not immersed in the solution when you turn the bottle). When you have an older dog not very cooperative in letting you spray inside the mouth, the position of the bottle moves as you struggle to hold down the dog, open her mouth, and spray. It makes for a comical scene, but minimizes the effectiveness of the product. I imagine this issue will be worse as the bottle is less than one third filled."
2,did not work for my cat,used on my cat twice a day for more than a month-no improvement at all-nothing!2 stars for the taste-spayed on myself by mistake-yummy)))
5,"Awesome, awesome. Get it, you won't regret it.",My kids love it. CD has games you can play both in the classroom and the home.
2,Not Necessary,This book pretty much tells you what you will figure out on your own. Waste of money - common sense stuff in this book.
5,Secrets our professors and instructors didn't tell us!,"Donna Cardillo has done a WONDERFUL service to our profession with this book. By interviewing working nurses, she is making life a little easier for future generations of new nurses! She, (and all those that she interviewed and quoted) doesn't want the new nurses making the same entry level mistakes that have been and keep getting made year after year.On behalf of our chosen profession and it's newest entrants, I offer thanks to Ms. Cardillo!(In the interest of honesty and full disclosure, I was interviewed for this book and I am quoted in it several times. All of my quotes were used in the intended context. Aside from the complimentary copy that I received as a contributor, I have not been given nor have I asked for any compensation for this review.)"
1,unhappy,"I purchased 5 copies sight unseen, based soley on quality articles I have read of Cardillo. This book is an insult to the intellegence of new nurses. Much of the content is true and could be helpful if not presented in such a condesending manner. Now I have 5 books I intended to hand out to the new nurses I mentor - never would I suggest they read this book. Cardillo is a great writer, I'm shocked she really wrote this!"
1,"Don't waste your money - this book should be titled ""Common Sense""","I'm borrowing from Kath's review because she said exactly what I wanted to:I picked up this book and hoped that it would give me an idea of what my first year as a nurse would be like, as the title implies. I was seriously disappointed because advice in this book was so general, it could fit almost any ""first"" job. It didn't have ANY solid advice for nursing.If you are looking for a book about what your first year will be like and advice on that subject, this is NOT the book for you. Also, it's written on maybe a 9th grade level, so anyone who has been through nursing school might find that the book insults their intelligence.The book can be summed up in one sentence: use common sense. If there's anything that a good nurse has, even a new one, is common sense."
5,A mentoring plus!,I have been an RN for two years and read the book for the first time to prepare for a presentation I was going to give to transitional nurses. I enjoyed the book tremendously and wish that I had read it much sooner! It is definitely a must read for all new nurses as well as those who wish to become leaders and help mentor new nurses thrive in their new profession.
2,Loud,"I put this fan in my Vista Media Center system. It's way too noisy to use on anything in the house... I took it out and ordered a ""silent case fan"" with the hope it will be ""silent""."
2,Great in theory.....,"We bought these for my child when he got in to the ""big bath."" He loved the letters and it really helped him learn. BUT they molded quickly and no matter what I did, I could not get the mold off them. I dried them after every use, stored them properly - but I was no match for the mold."
3,Want larger pieces,Please make larger. Would like larger pieces. Otherwise we like the idea and we like the numbers and shapes theme. We think it is cute.
4,Good product,"This product is great. My daughter loves chewing on these and sticking them to the tub. The picture makes them look bigger than they really are, but they still do what they say they would."
4,Much Needed Book - Right in Time for March Madness!,"This promises to be THE book on the NCAA college basketball tournament - all the stats, matchups, insights and interviews we've been craving since March Madness became 'The Spring Superbowl.'"
5,fidelitysound from JBL,"I bought the JBL speakers (JBL L880)a month a ago, and they are truly an example of quality sound engineering...high notes, for example in boy choirs from England, are carried without vibration, but also new dance or Hip Hop music with bass and strong beats come across equally well without distortion.. Violins in classical pieces come across with brilliance but not harshness.. I give these speakers my highest rating...j"
5,Great speakers,"These are great speakers and have really improved the sound in my home. JBL recommends raising the units off of carpet, but those four little spikes they furnish will just poke holes in your carpet. Look at 3/4"" or 1"" by 5/16"" threaded stem carpet casters. They do the job at a reasonable cost and look ok."
5,JBL-L880,"These speakers are everything and more than I expected!!! Amazon is a great site to order from, they have all been great for me shipping, best prices, and customer service."
4,Fun stories; great pictures,"This is an enjoyable overview of Hollywood and Heston's career, lavishly illustrated with photographs and Heston's own sketches. Much of the text is his commentary and explanation, making it a good companion to Heston's autobiography, In the Arena."
4,Five Lessons a Millionaire Taught Me about Life and Wealth,"This would be great for a young couple just starting out as it would take quite a part of your life to build up a wonderful savings account. If you are retirement age, I feel it is a little bit too late to use the tips."
4,"Informative, motivating","I got a couple copies after reading it myself, and gave to my daughter and girlfriend, hoping to motivate them to be more frugal, inteliigent, and responsible with their finances. The results are mixed but seemingly positive. This is a good read for financial amateurs and gives a basic overview of some excellent techniques for wealth creation."
4,Love the simplicity!,"FIVE EASY STEPS - That's all! All in plain, easy to understand language - what more could you ask for? And the information is all useful, correct and will work if you follow the plan. There is no reason that financial success and wealth creation should be hard or complicated. Thank you for a book that a person of any educational level can understand and apply! I highly recommend this book!- Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire."
3,Sometimes Simple is best,This is a fast and simple book to read. I found the ideas obvious and simple and I realize I have followed them to a large extent in my life.Worth reading. More important - worth doing.
1,"Good thing its a small book, kept the disappointment small....","Yet, another overpriced reiteration of some very basic and very sound, tried and true advice. At the end of the day, its all in the implementation, and yet, this quick and easy read requires nothing of the reader, so the results will be up to the reader.I was deeply disappointed in some of the references (Dave Ramsey, tech, tch, tch) and other investment advice was shallow and misleading.Mr. Evans, YOU need to read ""Becoming Your Own Banker"" by R. Nelson Nash and take a lesson from that! You are just another supporter of the ""Pirates Of Manhattan"" that Mr. James Barry Dyke speaks and references in his research on the boondoggle the American public has been left with.Perhaps you should stick to writing fiction.Eric Frohn"
5,Great book for any wrestling fan,"It is sad that any ""popular"" athlete can have a book written about them (Keyshan?????) But for wrestling fans, there has been little material in the literary world.My only complaint is that the book is too short. But it does a great job of detailing the careers of some of wrestlings most tragic and interesting characters."
4,Good book but facts were not completely right,It's a good book but I found somethings in it to be very wrong. Such as the Firing of Spicolli. Not even accurate. There were a few other things but I don't remember them off the top of my head.
5,Wrestling Observer's Tributes,"This effort by Dave Meltzer was very thorough and comprehensive.Unfortunately it did not contain any information or tributes toDick Murdoch or Adrian Adonis, which was my only gripe. Eachtribute is a collection of pictures, career history and thebehind-the-scenes look at what took place. It mentions notonly the death, but the circumstances that led up to the death.It is more than just a standard obituary. This book is actuallya collection of mini-biographies about each wrestlingpersonality. We learn about the politics behind the businessa little bit. Dave Meltzer is best known for his WrestlingObserver newsletter, and for being one of the best pro wrestlingjournalists in the world. This book is a must have on anywrestling fan's to buy list. I would recommend buying it."
5,Wrestling History written by the best.,"Obituaries are often the best way to present a history of a person, place, or thing. These stories cover different eras of wrestling and do a great job of covering the person, the place, and the wrestling industry. Wrestling History is only well written in a handful of places, although with good recent entries, it may be up to two handfuls. This book is certainly among the best of its kind. If anything, it could be longer. I hope this is the start of more books by Dave Meltzer. He's busy writing daily for his website and for his weekly newsletter, but I hope he can consolidate his vast knowledge into more great books."
4,"A fascinating book, but mind-numbing.","I have subscribed to Dave Meltzer's newsletter for many years. His career retrospectives are always fascinating. Sadly, they are almost always done after a wrestler has passed away. The tributes here are excellent. The career details for each wrestler are very well researched. My only suggestion is to read the book in small doses -- one tribute at a sitting. The mind gets numb after a while when reading about all the drug use and the tragic, young deaths. When taken as individual essays, every story in the book is riveting. A must-read for any long-time wrestling fan."
4,Maybe John Franklin needed revenge,"I read widely about arctic exploration, and I always wondered why Sir John Franklin set off for the arctic for the third time at the age of 59 when he was not in particularly good health. This book opened my eyes to his motivation. I will leave it to the readers to determine who they think was the driving force behind this unfortunate expedition."
5,So far I'm loving it,"I've known of the Rich Dad/ Poor dad series of books for quite some time. However this is my first material that I ended up trying from them. So far, I love it. I'm about half way through the first book, and I haven't even checked out the DVD's yet. I suppose there probably is a lot of repeated material from his other books as one reviewer pointed out. But if this your first read from the author you are going to love it.I already feel its worth 5 stars and I haven't watch the DVD's yet. A good deal."
5,Hilarious! Couldn' put it down.,"A very visual book, especially if you grew up with the London punk scene. The characters are vibrantly real and though not very likeable, you find yourself sympathising with them all the way! A very enjoyable book."
5,Very Good Book,"I found this work book to be easy to read & understand,...especially for a beginner like myself,,..."
4,Chock Full of Wonderful Memories,"I loved growing up a Patches Pal with JP Patches, Gertrude and the rest. This book if full of pictures and memories as well as great behind the scenes stories.Like others who are quoted in the story, meeting JP Patches was a thrill in my life. Glancing through the book I started to read it and ended up reading it in one sitting; it was wonderful but could have been longer!!![.]If you grew up in the Seattle area in the 50's - 70's you'll enjoy this book.We love you JP Patches! (I rated this 4 rather than 5 stars as I wanted the book to be longer.)"
3,husband loved it,My husband had business cards all over his desk so I gave him this card holder as one of his Chanukah gifts and he thought it was a great idea. Anything to get him more organized.
5,Great book! Enough said!,"This book is extremely detailed and well written. In my nine years in the Marine Corps I have always heard of the Marines conducting over 300 landings abroad. I was familiar with some, but had never really known what they were. I was amazed at how from it's inception, the United States has used military muscle to promote trade, maintain peace, gain influence or strategic position, or just simply get revenge for percieved transgressions. It was very interesting how events in the past have mirrored events in the present. This book is great for the history buff, but it reads like an action adventure book. This should be required reading for all the foriegn policy decision makers in Washington. It will remind them what made the U.S. the most powerful nation on earth and what it takes to keep her there."
5,Brevit Magnum Opus,"This book is a must read for both the novice and the professional student of war and political science. The Author does a great job of explaining American military involvement and intervention over a 200 year period, 1800-2000. Besides presenting a very fact filled and a very readable history, the last 4 chapters of this book provide both the lessons learned and a great analysis and rebuttal of earlier arguments and myths surrounding American intervention.This book is great reading, is fact filled and definately worth the time and effort.Professor Terry Tucker, US Army, SGM, Armor, Ret"
4,Informative read,"I enjoyed reading ""The Savage Wars of Peace"" as I think Max Boot has done an incredible job researching the material. His analysis also provided an excellent narrative, never becoming to dry. Some of the ""small wars"" covered by Boot were new to me and I enjoyed learning about them and the various important figures in U.S. naval history such as Smedley Butler, Littleton L.T. Waller and Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller.I am not so sure I agree with Boot's thesis about engaging in small wars in the modern era. Today's ethnic-driven strife and violence as well as the proliferation of arms, the rise of rabid anti-Americanism, and the seemingly endless number of insurgents abroad, make the likelihood of ""carrying out"" a small war impossible. One only has to look to Iraq as a reference.""The Savage Wars of Peace"" is an excellent read for anyone interested in learning more about U.S. military history. It is well-researched and worth the time to read."
2,details covered but fundamentally flawed analysis,"What is overlooked is that all the military actions were taken to protect American business interests and that this often entailed the overthrow of the elected governments and the installation of right wing dictators. Never in its history has the US acted in support of a democratically elected government. The USA was very late to enter the first world war as American businesses were making large fortunes by supply both sides. It was only the sinking of merchant ships by Germany's U-boats that finally forced President Wilson's hand. What military contractors lost in no longer being able to supply Germany and its allies it more then made up by supplying the American forces, which even included horses and feed stocks as we had a General Pershing who was in a time warp and re-fighting the Crimean War."
3,wars for empire!,"mssr. Boot's thesis is that little wars made us a ""great power.""Which begs he question: is raw influence/empire a good thing? Or do little wars begat bigger ones? From Boxer rebellion to Mao; from no-name Cubanos to Castro etc. Or--is ""gunboat diplomacy"" even possible in age of readily available ak47s, plastique ec. -- for more on this, see Black Hawk Down."
5,Don't listen to the in need of heavy medication Leftists,This book tells the truth. It is time for an American Empire!
1,Arm chair general Boot,"I love books like this one by 'historian' Max Boot. While he acknowledges the Imperial Nature of America and its expansionist policies, he does a disservice to his country by not engaging in war himself. Like most neo conservatives, he is most happy writing about wars and not actually being in one. For his cowardice, I award his book one star."
2,The Angel Who Forgot,I don't think most children would enjoy this book. Angels are fromGod and they don't forget. Maybe I'm too literal.
2,Not as good as in the past,"This is the second time I've used this product. The first time was several years ago (2008) and I ran it up the back walls for my surround speakers. I always meant to paint it to blend in, but never got around to it. However, I was happy because it stuck to the walls just fine for over a year before we moved.Now, in my new house, I ordered it to run speaker wire to another room (along the baseboard). I attached it to the baseboard (initially had a lot of tack) but within a week, half of it pulled away and is not sticking anymore. I was a bit skeptical of the other reviews stating it doesn't stick due to my previous experience, but they were right! Not sure what I will do... maybe add some glue and paint over it?"
4,"Hard to see, not so easy to install.","Hard to see, which is good, but not so easy to install if you change directions. Kinda pricey...."
4,Good Book,I find this book has some good recipes for eating well. I probably would have liked more pictures of the dishes and better break down of the contents of each food but overall everything I made is tasty.
4,Excellent Range & Depth,"Initially I was afraid to pick up this collection because I'd read everything of Rudy's still in print, and was afraid there would be duplicates. I needn't have worried.Everything here is either out-of-print (from ""The 57th Franz Kafka"") or published in magazines or previously unpublished -- there wasn't a single story I'd read before. There are a wide variety of styles and approaches here, some more successful than others. The best ones (like ""The Andy Warhol Sandcastle"") are very, VERY good while the worst (""Chaos Surfari"") are just kind of silly.Overall a collection of astonishing variety and imagination. Much better than the companion non-fiction anthology ""Seek!"""
2,Very Curious,While there can be no doubting that Alan is one of the best strummers around and many guitarists owe much to him this book alone is limited in it's use without the video. Also the quality of the enclosed CD is not good. I had to return the first copy because of skipping of data from the disc and the replacement was no better ... so beware.
5,In On The Joke,"There are so few kids books that make both the parent and child feel the wink of knowing what is going on while characters in the story do not. This is one of those rare rare books that succeeds on so many levels - the story unfolds visually and in the text as you gather what is going on. You aren't told - the dogs jump out of the paintings. You infer it. You aren't told the dogs re-enter the wrong paintings. You see it as various museum patrons react to the strangeness of paintings they thought they knew. And how wonderful is it to introduce grand masterpieces to kids in a way that is so much fun! My daughter loved this book, insisted we go to the art museum afterward and find dogs in other paintings. She imagined what would happen if other animals jumped off paintings and secretly partied after hours in the museum. 'Cats night out' 'Horses Night Out', etc. Run and get this book. You will be delighted."
4,Lorenzo...you go boy!,This is a man with so much talent. His voice mesmerizes me and I think he is one of the worlds most talented Mexican artists alive today. Keep up the good work Lorenzo! Love 'ya
5,Best childrens book ever and the pictures are great!!,"This book was handed down to me by my older brother and sister, and now goes to my daughter and son. We love the pictures and stories and the picker page (contents page with pictures). My favorite story is The Little Old Woman and her pig."
5,A Children's classic that unfortunately is no longer in print but you can still get used,"This was a hardcover classic that I enjoyed so much growing up in the 1950's and when I spotted it years ago in a bookstore, I immediately purchased several copies of it in the 1980's for our own daughters as well as several nieces and nephews for Christmas gifts. I acquired this very good used one recently for a friend's baby shower and would recommend it to add to any children's personal library.We also enjoyed this book as none of the stories were very long (5-10 minutes for most) and if there were time constraints for reading to the children or if a child has a hard time sitting for a length of time, any of these stories fit the bill.Please note that such tales as Little Red Riding Hood and others in this collection might be objectionable to conscious objectors' status due to the violence of the wolf eating grandma, for example."
1,Tape Eater,"Sending mine back-- liked the small profile and features. Shot a few minutes of video on a new tape. Brought it home to watch it and ate the tape up when I tried to rewind it. I'm glad I was only trying it out, I'd hate to have the tape of something important get eaten by the machine."
4,Great pocket size camcorder,"The size and shape of this camcorder is amazing! The finish is beautiful and elegant. This pocket size camcorder takes great video and the color is excellent. There are a few things it can do better: 1. Low light situations looks good but can do better. 2. Still pics are good for email or web but resolution is still low comparing to megapixel camera. 3. Battery last about 40-55 minutes (using lcd and viewfinder), but this is expected from such a tiny and thin battery. Despite few negatives, this is still a great camcorder to have and it is so tiny that will amazes you everytime you see it. Beautiful and awesome camcorder to travel around with. If you do decide, be sure to buy at least 2 extra batteries and get a MMC reader using usb."
3,Motor noise kills an otherwise great camera.,"While the small size of this camera makes it great to take around, and easy to use, it apparently doesn't come without a price. When I brought my Elura 2MC home, and shot a few minutes of test video, I was shocked to discover just how loud the motor noise was on the recorded video. Although there is a built-in noise filter, it seems to have no effect on the constant hum from the motor while filming.Given the price, I assumed that my camera had a manufacturing defect, so I took returned it for a new one. Unfortunately, the second camera had the same problem. While the camera is otherwise quite nice, the constant, annoying background really ruins the video it takes. ;-("
5,Delivers and More,"I took a brand new camcorder on an extended international trip shooting in a variety of harsh climates. Image quality - spatial and contrast resolution are superb. The colors are vibrant even in harsh sunlight. Better than average indoors. Editing is a breeze, even for a novice. You can't use this camera without everyone around you marvelling at its small size - even other jaded technofiles. Without reservation, an excellent camera."
1,DON'T BUY THIS DVD!,THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT MOVIE AS LABELED ON THE PACKAGING.IT IS SOME OTHER KUNG FU MOVIE OF THE POOREST QUALITY. YOU CAN BUY ''STREET GANGS OF HONG KONG''A.K.A. ''THE DELINQUENT''IN THE CHINESE LANGUAGE AT HKFLICKS.COM FOR ABOUT $20.00
1,Street Gangs of Hong Kong,"Buyer beware! Not the correct movie. Movie box cover is the correct movie, but the movie itself is incorrect. I have been looking for this movie in dvd for years and I got suckered into buying the last 2 releases at amazon and both are not the correct movie. I have a vhs copy of the correct movie and I saw it in the theater in the early 70s. If you enjoy 70s martial arts movies, you will like this one if you ever get a chance to see the correct one. Actually had a good story and acting and good fight scenes for an actor who never became famous."
1,We've had two and neither are reliable,"This was installed new with our Linear garage opener. It was very inconsistent, sometime it would work, other times it wouldn't - we'd replace the batteries, or even open the battery compartment and it would work. Then the next time you go to use it weeks or months later, it wouldn't work. Most frustrating is that the battery compartment has very small sized screws that fasten it and when you're locked outside, you likely don't have an extra small screwdriver with you. After a year or so of replacing batteries, I bought another identical model, thinking it was just a bad keypad. But no - same problems, same keypad. After having more people get stuck outside and not able to get into the house I am getting a new and DIFFERENT keypad. I'd be interested to know if anyone else has had similar issues. The garage door opener itself is fine, this keypad sucks."
5,as described,was a very inexpensive solution for a replacement that I was doing and I'm pleased with the product and the service.
5,It does the job.,This product works well at my home and it was very simple to setup and install. It comes with very clear instructions.
5,Great value easy to work and install,This was very easy to program just had to press the learn button on the unit in the garage and then punch in a code to the opener once and it was synced. Install the longest part was trying to find a drill in my garage. took 2mins to install. The Kids love the easy access to the house - No more falling over scooters left on the front porch. Highly recommend this to all.
5,Linear Garage Key Pad,Great product. Easy to set-up and mount. Took 5 minutes total and works great. Plus it looks good.
2,Difficult to use Map,Very Hard to use. Many major towns missing from map. Map was difficult to use for an American English speaker who did not benefit from the native language offered on the maps. Had to purchase maps at gas stations to navigate trips in Slovakia and Czech Republic. Will not use again.
5,Viking Adventure,"I liked this book because it was full of adventure. Aron, Sigurd, Rolf,and Gorm were brave people. They took boats very far to go to Wineland or USA to get grapes because grapes make wine and they love to drink wine. It was scary when they got to Wineland and Halfred killed an Indian with his bow to get his necklace to get rich. Halfred had a secret: he killed Gorm to leave Wineland to get away from the curse. Sigurd knew Halfred's secret; when they left to go home,Sigurd escaped off the ship and got to the Faroe islands and went home. The ship with Halfred on it got destroyed in a storm. I give it 100%."
5,A great historical fiction book for girls and boys,"I read this to my six year old daughter while we were studying Leif Erickson. It was a perfect combination of excellent story line and historical background. My daughter loved it and wanted to keep reading every time it was time to stop. I enjoyed it as much as she did. I think Bulla is one of the best children's writers out there and we seek his books out at every opportunity. Since the main character in this book is a young boy, I assume boys will love it even more than we did."
3,4 cup - this part is partially true,"4 mugs capacity would be a better description. Due to the construction of tea container the water flow around the loose tea leaves is severely restricted. The impact of it is two-fold:1. If you need just one or two mugs of tea you are out of luck, the first row of perforations in tea container starts just there...2. For 3 to 4 mugs it's ok, but as the water cannot freely circulate you need to add some brewing time, or use the plunger to force water movement.Additionally, when pouring tea make sure you hold the cover with your other hand...PS. As the capacity of it is close to perfect for me, I'm thinking about using my dremel and adding a few rows of perforations to the strainer. Original idea is that when the tea is ready you lower the plunger to stop steeping. As I pour tea as soon as it's ready, perforating the whole strainer would make it only better tea pot."
2,OK for a crowd,"The tea press works fine if you are planning on serving a crowd. For one or two people, it simply doesn't work. You must add an enormous amount of tea for the press to work properly. I once had a smaller tea press, and I thought that was what I was purchasing here."
5,Long-time user - Still satisfied,"I've been using Bodum's Assam Tea Presses for over a decade. I'm currently on my third. My husband and I are T-holics and it gets used almost every day. It's perfect for the black & green loose tea we buy in bulk. It makes enough for 2 mugs. And, the clean up is easy since everything goes in the dishwasher. We are very pleased with this product. The only problem we have ever encountered is with chai tea, which is--at least from our vendor--very fine and seeps out thru the holes in this and every other tea strainer."
3,Cheaply made,"This tea press works, but it is cheaply made. The inner basket is plastic, as is the press mechanism. The lid is held on by 2 small plastic pieces and one of the pieces had already broken off during shipment to me. I would advise spending a little more to get a better one."
2,not as expected,"I wanted to use this teapot for blooming teas, which is why I purchased a glass pot. Sadly, the filter is not removable without also removing the entire top. I also do not like that the filter is made of plastic. It seems odd to have plastic sitting in boiling water. The glass is very thin and the pot seems overpriced and shabbily contructed."
3,Two Tops Would Be Better,"This is a nice small tea pot. My only complaint is that the top/press doesn't stay on very well when you're pouring the tea. Had Bodum supplied a second no-bells-and-whistles top, I would have awarded more stars."
2,broken filter,"I have had this for a year and never put it in the dishwasher, but the plastic filter is starting to break off bit by bit. Just checked the website to see if I could buy a replacement, but could not find. I love this teapot, but am very disappointed."
2,Looks nice except for the polycarbonate strainer and plunger,"I was poised to buy this product, but unfortunately, it has parts made from polycarbonate.That would not be so terrible if these parts were not designed to be immersed in hot water which is then drunk. Polycarbonate may not be safe for immersion in hot liquids, due to a constituent chemical called Bisphenol-A. (Actually I personally don't use any plastic heated in contact with food or drink unless I can't avoid it.)Bisphenol-A is an endocrine disruptor, so if you're thinking of reproducing you may wish to avoid it for the sake of the next generation.This is my own personal opinion, not set forth as scientific fact; this review represents my own best understanding of this issue. If you want to look it up for yourself, however, you can google Bisphenol-A where you will find much more authoritative information on the subject."
1,No warranty for cracked strainer,"I purchased this product recently, and have hand washed the plastic strainer maybe 3 or 4 times. It was getting tea stained, so I checked their website to make sure that it was dishwasher safe. When I saw that it was, I put it into the top rack of the dishwasher. It came out with a piece completely cracked off. I emailed them twice with no response, so today I called and they said that ONLY their electrical items are warrantied. Nothing else - no exceptions. This is the last Bodum product I will buy. What lousy customer service! I guess they must make their money on the first Bodum product a person buys, because they certainly can't have a lot of repeats with that kind of attitude."
3,Versatile teapot,I enjoy having this teapot because loose tea and teabags can be used. The drawbacks are that it does not pour well and the inner strainer stains.
5,My wife loves it,Bought this as a gift for my wife and she loves it. Dont have to worry about the filter breaking as it is plastic.
2,Stuck plunger,"The idea is nice, and I did not have a problem with leaves escaping. However the leaf container is annoyingly difficult to clean, and worse, after you set the plunger, it gets stuck and is difficult to remove. I ended up using a normal infuser and drip tray."
1,Great brewer but very fragile w/ no support from Bodum,"I purchased this pot in Dec. '11. It brews great tea! Something about the pot shape and the press size is just right.But: The basket and press are too fragile. I dropped the press in the sink and the bottom disc broke off. I e-mailed Bodum's customer service and asked for a replacement press. They were polite, but said that the 1 year warranty was only on the glass pot. The other parts aren't covered by the warranty. I repaired the press with epoxy putty. It held for several weeks, then broke again this morning. Also, a small piece broke off the rim of the brew basket. I would willingly pay more for the pot with a stainless steel basket and press.Don't buy this pot unless you a willing to handle it with ""kidd gloves""."
2,Could be better,"Description says it has a 'stainless steel lid' this is FALSE. The lid and the infuser (inside piece) is plastic. In fact, everything is made of plastic except the glass 'tea pot.' The inside/clear plastic absorbs the color of the tea after 6-7 uses and now looks, very old. The poor quality plastic makes me wonder if I should even drink the tea now. Hummm ....."
5,Enjoying better tea,I gave my wife the Tea Press for Christmas along with a variety of loose teas. The press makes a lovely cup of tea. It works just as advertised and it has opened a new wider variety of teas for us with the loose teas. We really enjoy it.
1,Plastic garbage,"I opened this teapot and immediately dropped the plastic plunger on the floor where it cracked in half, rendering the whole tea press useless.I would hope for $45 it would be made of more durable material."
1,Crappy infuser..... get the one with metal infuser!,Saw this item in a local coffee shop and figured I could find it on Amazon for less money. Well..... yes & no..... I bought this Bodum press with the plastic filter. The plastic filter is terrible..... The fine mesh metal infuser inserts are MUCH BETTER.......Just spend the extra $ and get the model that has the metal infuser. :)
2,"Only good for brewing, not serving or pouring","When you pour tea from this pot, it dribbles everywhere and makes a mess. You also cannot use it as a simple tea pot; it's only good for steeping the tea, not for serving. The lid is attached to the plunger and it's sized to fit the top of the plastic insert, i.e. when you try to use the lid alone, it falls into the pot. So much for keeping the rest of the tea hot while you sip the first cup! I'm buying something else."
1,Not crazy about this,"My dad has the larger size and uses it for tea bags, and he got me the smaller version when i moved out. From day one, every time i poured tea from the spout, it pours in equal amounts onto the table.My store sells these, but i always recommend for life products, or just plain tea infusers, rather then a pot. It's very disappointing."
4,ALMOST perfect! Almost!,"This teapot is the perfect size for making tea for just myself, or for my husband or a few friends. There are a few downsides, though. The bottom inch-ish of the tea holder part has no holes, so you have to fill the teapot at least half full or more to have any real tea steeping action. The other one is that you do NOT want to push down on the top of the infuser piece to squeeze out your fresh tea from the infuser part [to make it mix faster, etc.] because, depending on the tea you use, it squeezes out the holes and you get actually TEA bits in your tea. I actually got a little extra strainer to go in the top part of my cups and I pour the tea through that to collect any little tea bits. But for $20, it's really not bad!"
5,Love This!,I love this tea pot. It is awesome. I use the small pot at work and keep it at my desk and I have the large one at home for the weekends and evenings. I think it is terrific.
2,bad idea for tea,"i received this tea pot as a gift and thought wonderful, because I have a coffee press similar to this that I love, but for tea, not so much. The plastic infuser never seems clean, the plunger doesn't really push out all the hot water,it does not drain well and yet must be removed to prevent over steeping the tea. And then Grandma always said not to squeeze the tea, that it makes the brew bitter. So this was neither convenient or useful."
2,Loose lid,"I bought this to keep in the office to enjoy tea on chilly winter afternoons.Sadly the lid is loose and will not shut tight, thus when you try to pour beyond a certain angle it is going to spill open.This was not what I wanted from a teapot.I returned it."
2,Glass teapot with plastic parts,"Just a word of caution for those of us who do not heat plastic materials, this has a plastic basket and plastic tea top. The tea pot itself is glass."
4,nice teapot,"Nice teapot, wish the lid wasn't so floppy when you pour. Nice quality, brews lovely tea. Cleans easily and looks great!"
5,Bodum Assam 4-cup tea press,I gave this item as a gift and the recepient loves it and uses it daily. She is so thankful for the tea press feature that she is not going to purchase any more tea bags in the future.
2,High Expectations.... dashed,"So, my sister has this and loves it. Still is on her original first purchase from years ago. I got two for wedding gifts, and was thrilled, as I know the brand is great and their other products I own have been stellar. Sadly, within the first year of usage, both pots shattered. They both broke. Not sure if it was because we hand washed them, but the glass was very fragile, and did not do well. Now that I have a dishwasher, I might try another one, but don't want to put up the money for it when our Meilor tea press is holding up wonderfully."
2,Not as advertised,"I had used it once and I am returning it. The infuser is not the height of the pot and the holes on the infuser are not all the way to the bottom. Between these two unfortunate design flaws you need to pour more water than necessary for the tea to infuse, plus a lot remains in the infuser because the pusher does not push all the way down either.Plus and plus, even though I used large leave loose tea I still had pieces in my cup and capacity is most certainly not four cups. Nobody nowadays uses tiny tea cups. It's not a princess party, we use real size cup/mugs. This pot will make about 2.5 cups. That is real cups. Not measuring cup.The only plus is that it looks pretty.Also, they should include a cork coaster/stand/trivet. I had seen some bodum pot pictured with it on the net, but could not find one for sale."
1,Broken when I received it,"The black plastic plunger on this item was broken when I opened it. I didn't open it immediately upon receiving it - I am going to contact the seller today and see if they will send me a new plunger. If they do, I'll update the review and give them a more favorable score."
1,Press - NOT,"I thought this would be more like the coffee press, which I really liked. This thing doesn't press the tea at all, since the rod doesn't go to the bottom. Taste of the tea is not nearly as good as when brewed by my previous method. Am trying to think up some other use for it, but so far no ideas. Seems like a singularly useless product."
1,I expected more from Bodum,"I purchased a 4 cup Bodum teapot as a christmas gift and sent it directly to the recipient. Recently, during a visit I tried to use the teapot. I found that the cover was flimsy and fit the teapot only when the tea basket was in place. The cover fell off when the pot was tipped. The teapot arrived, I learned, with a broken positioning flange on the tea basket. I was disappointed to have given this as a gift. I expected more from Bodum."
5,Vintage fresno,"I am a resident of this town, good history of the Area and of the early settlers of the California area."
1,too simplistic,"This is a pamphlet, not a book. The information describing this should indicate the level of the oncversation in this ""book."" It's very introductory. I bought this as a gift and didn't even give it to the recipient. It would have been an insult. I'm very disappointed."
2,Didn't like it,Just too cruel and raw for my taste. Some of the details are just too descriptive for me. It just went on and on about how to kill and in what awful manner....it never seemed to end.
4,Duke Ellington by Ron Frankl,"This is one of the best books I have read thus far for the young adult level. Any collector or fan who is interested in the photographics of Ellington should defintely purchase this book. Most authors use the Smithsonian's photos. This author seemed to concentrate his search for photos to the NYC area. The author appeared to have written the book more out of love of jazz than royalities. I would highly recommend it as a teaching tool for the juvenile and the photos for the collectors. In 105 pages, he has 65 photos."
4,For those who like to synthpop,"This music deserves a to be heard by a wider audience.Let everyone else keep there Avril's and Sum 41's. Thismusic stirs something in me. Good synth music with intelligentlyrics, and a great bargain for three cds worth of synth popgoodness. Try it and like it."
5,The Canon GL1 is the best Camera on the Market,"The Canon GL1 is a professional DV camera, that is in the marginally afordable range for general consumers. The piture quality is full professional broadcast quality, and looks far better than any other Digital Camcorder that I have used in the sub $3000 range. It is compatible with more firewire cards and computer programs than any other products on the market. Quality, compatability, service, are all best available. DEFINATELY worth the price difference over all other general consumer cameras."
2,Poor quality controll with no Manufacture support,The First Aid [2.0] kit I received was of poor quality. The right seam on hte left inside pocket was only sewn 1/2 way to the bottom. See Pics posted. Needle holes could be seen in the plastic and I called the manufacture who confirmed the pocket should be sewn all the way. I asked them If they would support their product and they would not. This was clearly a manufacturing defect and the Manufacture (or should I say importer) told me they could not help me and to return it to where I bought it from. The case was made overseas with the finest of craftmanship NOT. Hopefully the seller will replace the defective item. Very Poor construction on this Adventure Medical Kit [2.0] and no Manufacture support. This will be the last Adventure Med Kit I buy or Recommend.
1,Poor customer service ... Zero response,"The little compass doesn't work so I tried to contact Adventure Medical Kits. Web site has no customer support link just an ""Ask the Doc"" page. Entered a message there got nothing in reply. So one star for non-existent customer support."
4,A good kit,"Bought as stocking stuffers last Christmas. Thankfully none of us have had to use them. We added tylenol, lighter, tweazers, and some other things as the bag has room for extras to have a complete kit as we deemed necessary. Small, light weight, and functional."
4,Worth the money,"This product is a must have for every car. I got one for all my kids, my husband and myself."
4,Great Camping Aid,"I bought this kit when preparing for the Appalachian Trail. It makes a great Kit for camping, not for Hiking. I cut the Kit down to bare needs and used the remaining space to hold other items because the container is great quality."
4,"Good size, good selection, I'll probably add to it","I got the 1.0 which I think is a good start. The compass kind of sucks and I wouldn't rely on it. Luckily, there is a little extra room for more band aids and probably a decent compass,, maybe even a few small fire starting things. As it stands, it's a lot more first aid and a lot less survival stuff. I wouldn't rely on it without modification. It's interesting, I have been hunting by myself for years with almost nothing in case something went wrong and luckily nothing ever has. And I've been up and down rocky hill sides and everything else, I'm just very careful. But after watching ""I shouldn't be Alive,"" I've decided to prepare just in case. A lot of times, those people would have been fine with just a few key items."
5,A Great Gift!,"I have bought several copies of this book to give to family and friends. It makes a very good gift. It is the perfect coffee table book and sparks great conversation. Of course, I am prejudiced since I am a member of Dr. Gaddy's church. I do love this man and am proud to say that I know him. However, even if I did not know him I would still recommend this book."
3,Best tag-line ever!,"""BIGFOOT"" ... Breeds with anything. Unfortunately, as it is with most ad campaigns, this film does not live up to the promise of the poster. There are only the slightest hints at BIGFOOT/human lovemaking. For those of us who are fans of the Sexual Sasquatch, this is only a tease. Let's see a picture with horny bigfoot who knows how to close a deal! Also, there are way too many Mitchums in this for my taste."
1,Avoid The Cheezy Flicks Bootleg DVD!,Avoid this atrocity at all costs!!! This is just a VHS to DVD-R bootleg! I have been hoping someone like Code Red or Scorpian Releasing to release a legit pressed & authored DVD with Extras!
5,Coffee for one...,"I purchased this smaller unit because I prepare coffee for one...and this works wonderfully. I think that it will be necessary to be particularly careful after removing the glass container from the metal frame for cleaning as the glass appears to be very fragile. If you provide the proper ingreditents and grind, it will really do its part to start your day. I am pleased with this purchase."
5,Steps of faith,This DVD tells the story of a New Tribes Mission missionary pilot who escapes after being captured by rebel fighters and forced to fly his airplane to their camp. It is an account of his steps of faith and is an excellent inspirational film. It is also available through the New Tribes Mission bookstore.
1,Very difficult to impossible to inflate,purchase these tubes since they were the cheapest delivered due to Prime. Figured a name brand such as Slime would not be a bad tube. But installation has been awful! I'm using a 100 psi tank but that took 10 minutes to inflate 1 tube. The second tube won't take ANY air at all. I guess the Slime product sealed the valve before I had a chance to inflate the tube. I'm not happy with this product at all.
4,Liked it.,This is much better antenna and it does not ruin your nylon on the net. The clamp is pretty secure.
5,Great Boning Knife,The Culinary Institute of America is well known for the quality of education aspiring chefs receive and any product they put the CIA name on is also going to be top quality. This knife is all that and I highly recommend. It's also great value being much less than well known brands like Wusthof or Henckels. Can't go wrong with this knife for making quick work of boning poultry and meats and can save you money by doing it yourself rather than the butcher doing it for you.
2,"""Armoured Firepower"" shoots a dud.","While advertised as a book on AFV weaponry, this is really just a standard history of tank development of the war years. Its jacket boasts of ""five highly detailed appendices"" (1 for each of the main countries covered) yet none of them carry the armor penetration of the weapons. I found it amazing how little information could be packed in 250 pages. If you are looking for a book on weaponry, Chant's ""World Encyclopedia of the Tank"" has essentially all the information contained in ""Armoured Firepower"" and contains info on all tanks, from WW1 through the present. It is a much better buy."
1,Looks like good value but it is not,"When I bought this set I thought, well, how can you go wrong at this price? You can. I knew I was in for trouble after the first lingering (and lingering) shots of an Alligator in the Everglades. The sequence on the Redwood Park of Northern California is better, then it leads you down for a view of life in the nearby Pacific, But, guess what? The next scenes are of tropical Caribbean fish and bottom fauna, including the Blue Surgeonfish. Whoops! Not the giant kelp forests of the Northern California Coast. I'll admit that some of the shots are good, particularly when there is no panning (when the animals are moving by themselves). The panning action is not tracked, but done by someone making a circle while holding the camera in place. So, you get none of the parallax or depth information that we are used to seeing in ""fly through"" cinematography. If you still think this is a good value for you, try it and let us all know what you think."
2,Plunger Problems,"I want so much to love this item. Received it as a gift. My only complaint is what others have mentioned about the sinking plunger. Even the plastic seal wont prevent it from sinking. The steam from the hot water makes it worse. I've tried drying the seal with a towel, to give it more grab (something I really shouldn't have to do) and it still sinks. My solution (as mentioned by another reviewer) is to put the plunger/cap in at a slight angle. Ridiculous. All in all the plunger assembly is very slipshod.And as for the capacity, I have pretty large mugs, so for me one brewing equals one serving. But that's just me. Still, I try to enjoy the press as much as possible."
5,Perfect for one,"It's the perfect size for one person. I'll try to avoid smashing this, but that's not likely, seeing as how I've broken two Bodum coffee presspots in the last couple years.Love the Bodum quality. And to make this teapot even better, it's made in Germany. It'll last for years, if I'm careful."
4,Great for loose tea and herbals,"I keep this pot at my desk at work. It's size is perfect and the brewing insert leaves plenty of room for the tea leaves to unfurl naturaly. I have completely abandoned the plunger. I don't even use it anymore. I simply place my tea in the plastic insert, and pull it out when the tea is done brewing (careful to drain the excess tea by tipping to the side) and set it on a napkin or paper towel.It's great for filling up right from the hot spigot on the water cooler. Also, if I'm drinking green tea or an herbal, I keep the plastic tea holder to the side and reuse for a second or third pot."
3,Nice Item,This is a great tea pot. The only problem is that for some reason it tends to leak when you are pouring. I have the larger pot and it doesn't do it at all. Other than that I love this. I make tea all day long and keep this pot right at my desk. It is terrific!
2,Disappointing,"The biggest problem is the product design. The lip is too small, especially in relation to the roly-poly carafe; it needs to protrude a little more. No matter how carefully I pour, the tea dribbles all over the place. As you can imagine, this adds to your clean-up."
1,"owned it for less than 2 months, and the strainer cracked!","too bad i cannot return the item anymore coz it passed the 30day return policy. Was not happy with the quality. The strainer cracked and i just had it for just a month or so, and was only used 2x/wk."
3,its fine..,"Its cute, thats a given but I do not like the fact that there is no alternate lid for it, the plunger is the lid and you cannot just take the strainer out and replace a lid..some teas are too nice to just sit in the pot endlessly so thats the only thing I didn't like other than that its awesome to brew loose tea but the only way to avoid steeping too long is to take out the filter empty it and then replace the filter and plunger..I like the kinda tea pot that you can take out the infuser and still have a lid."
3,"Great design, poor execution","I have enjoyed my tea press, but there are a couple of things about it that do bother me. The first is that the lid/plunger assembly does not really fit squarely in the tea press. It's kind of loose on top, and I can't push it down to make it fit without risking a burn. If I do push it down on one side, it pops up on the opposite side. The second thing is that the plunger automatically goes down when the lid is on. I end up pulling it up over and over until I am ready for the tea to stop brewing. There's not enough friction in the design. I think better manufacturing would solve both of these problems."
2,Built for members of the lollipop guild,It's my fault for not realizing just how small this teapot actually is. I thought about immediately sending it back once it arrived but it's gotten so many good reviews that I figured I must be missing something. I really wasn't. I get maybe a cup and a half out of this (no dainty little tea cups for me either) and the holes are too large for some of my finer loose teas. I end up getting a lot of loose tea in my cup and floating in the pot. I purchased a Finum brewing basket and prefer that to this.
3,Mostly good except for one annoying thing...,"It's the right size for what I was looking for and it's easy to clean (I throw most of it in the dishwasher). The one problem, and it's really annoying, is the holes in the steeper are too big. Almost any tea I buy has bits that leak into the outer part and then get in my tea."
5,Great small tea press,"Bought this for my wife who has been trying out loose leaf teas. I was already a fan of Bodum from their French Presses, and this tea press does a great job. It's perfect for one to two people as it only makes 17oz."
4,Awesome.,"this tea press is great. We used ones very similar at the culinary school I attended. Though, the holes are a bit large and allow leaves to get through and the lid tends to get stuck, occasionally causing the water to splash, which can burn. Otherwise it is good!"
2,Cute does not a good teapot make,"I don't care how cute a teapot is; if it is dribbling when you pour the tea, it is poorly designed, and does NOT deserve four stars! I can't understand how a company whose main focus is tea and coffee products can make a teapot with such a glaring design problem, i.e. a rounded spout. I would not recommend this product for that reason."
2,well built but....,This little tea pot is just perfect for the single cup person. Well built but the downside I discovered was the holes in the press are too large and some of the teas I use just pass right through. I only recommend this if the buyer uses ONLY large loose leaf type teas not the finer herbal type teas. I do get some teas that come in a circular type filter packs and those work perfect!
1,drip drip drip,"I love Bodum products, but in this case they've failed. I have a few coffee presses from then and even stovetop moka pots. I should have listened to my inner Alton Brown and just used one of those for tea, but I wanted separate pots for tea and coffee. Coffee tastes stay in the presses for a while after you use them.As for this pot, I'm extremely disappointed with them. No matter how I try to pour it, it always drips and dribbles down the side of the pot and it gets all over my table. The pouring lip is way too short and the round fat pot makes you have to start pouring.It looks awesome and my coworkers all admire how ""cute"" it looks, but it's all show and no go.The strainer mechanism isn't that great. The holes don't seem to allow the water to pass through it that well. I've had cheaper better similar looking (but not as pretty) pots from chinatown that look better using mesh.I can't recommend it."
5,Finally a consistant cup of tea!,"This is a wonderful way to steep tea. The size is perfect for two cups, and if you use a high grade tea there won't be any tea leaves spilling into your cup. I highly recommend it!"
2,my opinion,"Starchip troopers broken down is simply a frist person shooter in another world. This was a bit of a let down in terrms of gameplay and possed few to no challenges, other than a low jump capabilities wich probabley is the only bit of realism in the game. (this comment form playing games that when in power armor allow you to jump higher and move faster)The graphics of the game were over all well done as well as the ""SWARM engine"" the developers used was fun to watch. I would have to say that there were two things they could of done more on was fire and the people.Other than this the condtion of the game it self was brand new."
2,my oponion,not a bad game when you feel like just blowing away everything in sight but you have too be in the right mood for it
5,Great stroller for growing families,"With a two week old and a fifteen month old we wanted a stroller that would adapt as both girls got older, the Phil and Ted seem to be the best balance between price and features. Well made, easy to put together and seems very safe, probably not hardcore enough for serious joggers but seems as if it can handle a decent amount of punishment. Can have baby lying flat in her cocoon whilst the toddler is sitting above in her seat then, once the baby is a bit older then they can both sit one above and in front of the other, looks a bit odd but we're pretty sure it'll be fine. Recommended, this Phil and Ted's excellent stroller isn't even slightly bogus dude."
5,Some of the last Rock 'n' Roll in the Northwest,"With all the emo and punk rock bands that make up most of the music and critical darlings in the Northwest these days, where do you go for a little american rock n roll? Kim Virant's new CD is one of the best records put out in the seattle for awhile now. Her voice is strong and soulful she has powerful lyrics and a great band backing her. ""Rock"" Tim helps each song build to a climax and explode with his guitar masterwork. The last song on the album features Kim playing piano and it is completly gorgeous, different from everything else on the album, and needs to be heard (it gets to me every time). ""Stealing Days"" is probably the strongest track, but ""Melinda"" and ""Lucky Me"" aren't far behind. Oh, and there is a cover of The Who's ""getting in tune"" (they do it some damn fine justice), that's also on the Who Cares? comp. cd- what more could you ask for?"
4,Infinity PS 10 - Subwoofer - 250 Watt - black,Has all the power I need for my family room and I only run it at about 1/3 volume. I like the auto-on feature that turns the power to the sub on when you turn on the sound system. First time I listened to a movie with the sub connected I jumped when someone slapped the side of a soda machine because of the sound coming from the sub.
4,icre maker,Ice maker arrived in a few days with all accessories and ready for install. Drop it in and turn it on in about 20 minutes. Good vendor will use again in the future.
2,VERY SLOW,"Our old ice maker would dump new crescents 5 to 7 times daily. The new only makes new crescentabout twice daily, which won't keep up.It was a direct replacement for our old one, and I had to use the electric cord adapter whichwas included.I contacted the shipper about this problem after about two weeks of usage. They shipped meanother which now dumps 3 to 4 times daily. I'm hoping this will improve as it doesn't keep up.The shipper was very accommodating, and I would recommend them, but not this product.I was able to find complete ice maker kits for about the same price range, but they didn'thave the correct electrical hookup for me."
5,eldo,This ice maker fit right in to my fridge and worked great without any adjustment. Started making ice immediately. Ice size was correct with no adjustment. Received the icemaker in record time from vendor. Packeged well.
5,Icemaker Review,The replacement icemaker for my refrigerator was very easy to install and works great. By purchasing and installing the replacement icemaker myself I saved over $100.
3,Fine replacement for our aging ice maker,"Our ice maker was having more and more difficulty making ice. The main issue was that new ice would often get stuck just when it is supposed to fall in the bucket and block the mechanism. This was generating an annoying 'tick-tick-tick' noice as the motor was trying to continue its rotation.I am happy to have found this replacement which fit perfectly in place. The replacement was very easy as the connections were the same as the original ice maker.Now, we have ice again and not more annoying noise an any time of the day and night :)** update after one year of usage: one of the dents on the ice maker broke about 1.5 months ago and now it does not produce ice anymore (ice won't eject). Too bad as it seems the only solution is to replace it again. Changing my rating from 5 to 3 stars since this was expected to last longer than year."
5,Amazing collection of iconographic images,"This book is truly an amazing collection of both icons of Tibetan Buddhist deity-types, and information about the same.While this book is undeniably expensive, if you're really interested in Tibetan Buddhist art and/or iconography, you'll be happy to have this book in your library.Well, someone had to write the first review and give this book a 5-star rating!"
3,Protein with a Crunch,"I have the LapBand, so everything I eat needs to count towards my protein count, and I can't waste calories. This is a good snack for when you're craving a crispy sensation but want to feel you're doing your body good. It's still a carbohydrate, but the balance is tipped towards the protein."
2,English Subtitles Please,"If you are looking for a travelogue, this is not it. The background scenery provides a small glimpse of Afghan modernity. There are lengthy Farsi and Dari dialogues by locals sans English subtitles and no explanation of the thrust of the conversation by the moderator, Anwar Hajer. I was looking for authentic information to educate me for a possible humanitarian venture in Afghanistan - This did not fulfill that need in the least.I would like to meet Anwar Hajer, however."
1,27PT6441/37,"It's too bad that I had to give this one star. Mine lasted less than a year. I went to turn it on, and it wouldn't power up. Calling customer service was a joke, and it would have cost me over $100 to have a repairman come out. Philips couldn't care less on the phone.I'll need to pick up some fuses and fix the thing. I won't be buying another Philips product."
1,Well here is number uhhh......,"Just like everyone else I purchased this wonderful paper weight for $320 and it stopped working after 6 months. I had read the reviews which there were 6 at the time and I figured they were just unlucky. I have owned philips products before and they worked great. So I thought what the hell I will give this thing a shot. I was watching tv turned it off went to work came home and nothing, no power no noise no light no nothing. I tried different outlets and nothing so i called customer support. Support sent me to a authorized repair shop where they want $35 just to test this thing and a total of $85 to fix it if they can. So like some of the others I will try the fuse replacement its worth a shot. I will never buy a philips made product ever again and neither should you. Thanks for your time"
3,It would be good if it weren't for the fuse,"I have to say that other than having the same fuse problem a few weeks after the warranty ran out, I have had no problems with this TV. It has a lot of good features and I've had none of the control/image issues others have talked about. Fortunately for me, I checked the internet first, before I called Phillips Customer Service, so I was able to get my Radio Shack fuses and make the repair. The TV has worked well ever since. For what it's worth, I have an LG (Phillips) LCD flat panel TV and an LG flat screen monitor in my home. When I called the CS line for LG after losing my remote, they were fast, efficient and friendly...I guess it's like the difference between Honda and Acura. Back to the 27PT6441, I wouldn't recommend it, but I've been pleased with it overall."
1,same issue,This TV is useless. Same issue. Changed the fuse and that worked for 4 months. Its not working anymore. Don't buy this product.
1,27 peace of %#@^,"This is by far the worst tv product released on the market.It sucks so bad I wouldn't take it even if it was free, When is Philips going to recall this piece of (...). If you by this tv get your wallet ready for repairs worth more than the tv cost."
1,Philips Go Die!!! - Thou Shalt Always Be Hated,"Thanks one and all for the great information abt the fuse issue in Philips #27PT6441/37.Philips sucks and I am not going to buy it ever again. I will also demotivate other from doin so.Any way..... After opening the TV, I saw the old fuse from the TV. It had a thin wire in it. I was expecting the wire to be fused but the thin wire was still there in the glass fuse. I assumed that my TV had different issue. BUt when I compared the old fuse with the new fuse(Radioshack 4Amp 250V slow blow) I learnt the difference. The new fuse had a small thick lump in the center of the thin wire inside the fuse. Where as in my old fuse it dint. So i conculded that the fuse had blown off. I just replace the old fuse with the new one and my TV started in jiffy.Thanks once again Every once.Philips Sucks!!!"
1,I wish there were 0 stars,"This is junk, it blows fuzes and is a cow of a thing to move.There are websites devoted to how bad this thing is. Consider a brick instead of this - cheaper and better to look at."
1,Dead tv,"Same problem as everyone else, just wanted to add my review to keep the numbers building so everyone knows the problem!I am afraid to open the back of my tv, and based on reports that the tv dies again only a few months after replacing the fuse I think I will opt for a new (NON-PHILIPS) set instead. I feel so ripped off!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This TV should have had a recall done. Philips does NOT stand by thier products and the TV is junk!
1,Radioshack part # Error,Someone earlier in these postings listed radioshack p/n 270-1056 as the fuses to buy to fix this poorly-made product. This is no longer correct.. currently that part number is for 125V/5A Fast-Acting Fuses. THESE ARE NOT THE RIGHT ONES. Make sure you read 250V/5A Slow-Blow on the package.
1,WAS LOOKING FOR A 0 STAR,***HOLE PHILIPS COMPANY. WILL never buy a philips product again. Wasn't aware of this issue until started googling and found out 100s of people having the same exact problem. The TV just shut off. I am guessing its because of the fuse. My husband's moved to another city. So have to depend on friends to take this STUPID IDIOTIC TV to the repair shop. Feel like going and punching the guys who approve this product at phillips.NEVER BUY ANY PHILIPS TV IF YOU DONT WANT TO RIP YOUR MONEY OFF.
1,Disappointed!,"I have owned this TV since October of 2004 with few problems. I was watching the TV earlier this afternoon and turned it off before dinner. At 7pm it would not turn on at all!I spoke with Philips customer service and did not get anywhere! All they could tell me was to take the TV to the nearest service center over 30 miles away! I am not excited about lugging my TV to and from a service center, especially after reading the posted reviews and comments. I am tempted to try to fix the problem myself, but as a design engineer I am annoyed by the fact that Philips is not taking responsibility or any corrective action for what clearly is a product/design defect!"
1,BAD TELEVISION,"As with all the others, my first of this model TV crapped out on me within 30 days of having it. I took it back to get a new one and now the something similar has happened to my second TV. First, it shut off without any reason, and when I turned it back on the screen spilled off the edges of the TV, so now I can't see the entire picture.DO NOT BUY THIS TV!"
1,This is ridiculous,"The same thing has happened to my TV that everyone else is saying. This is insane. Shouldnt Philips have to do something about this? It seems to be the same problem on every set. I'm going to call Philips and demand something in return for my troubles, and oh yes, i will go to the top if I have to. Everyone needs to call and complain about it, so they understand they have to rectify this situation."
1,This TV comes equipped with its own 4 month time bomb,"I had the exact same problem you see the other 23 people talking about. Bought the TV at the very end of December 2004. It is now the very end of April 2005, and while I was watching it one day it decided to just go dead on me. From what I can tell this thing is a lemon, and there should have been a recall. It was a good TV while it lasted but $300 for 4 months is beyond the point of ripping you off it is clear highway robbery. As many of the others have said I wish I would have seen these reviews before. DO NOT BUY THIS TV IT IS A LEMON!"
3,Just a bad fuse.,"The tv worked fine for 1 1/2 years and then didn't turn on. I read the reviews on here and it was a fuse just like everyone said. The current radio shack p/n is 270-1067 250V/5A Slow-Blow fuses. You'll need a size ""10"" torx bit or a small flat-head screwdriver to remove the 9 screws (8 around the perimeter and 1 in-between the component inputs). For more detailed instructions on changing the fuse, look at some of the older reviews."
1,Wish I had seen these reviews before!,"We bought this tv on oct 11th, 2004. It's now March 28th, 2005 (just a short 5 1/2 months later) and it's not working! It worked at 1pm and come 2pm? the power wouldn't come on. C.S. at phillips just said to unplug it and try again. when it didn't work, they said it was an internal prob and take it to a repair service. the service shops around here are a joke and said it would be atleast $80 for labor alone. We are livid and extremely angry at phillips for making such a shabby product that they will not back. We have 15 to 20 year old ge, sony and zenith tv's that still work like brand new and have ever, ever had a problem! so much for phillips. We'll never make the mistake again of buying a phillips product.For us, it was just a blown fuse. A simple fix by replacing the blown fuse with a $2.00 250 volt, 4amp slow blow fuse bought at any home improvement store. Hope this helps someone!"
1,No Zero Stars?,"I don't even want to give this television the lowest 1-star rating it is that bad. I bought one in January from B3st buy. It had the best looking picture out of all the 27 inches there (and I spent about an hour and a half comparing. In March (2 months later) it just would not turn on. Service tech came out and and made me wait 2 weeks for parts, fixed it, 2 hours later it would not turn on again. It's now been nearly 2 months and I'm still waiting for parts for it to be fixed a 3rd time. I'm hopeing it will break again so I can finally get it replaced because it just doesn't seem new anymore.I highly recommend not purchasing this television and reading the fine-print on b3st buys 4yr in home service agreement! It's just not worth the trouble."
1,- 5 Rating,"I wish there was a negative rating for this TV, like everyone else it crapped out over little over a year. I called philips and after they escalate it you will never hear from their deaf Tier 2 and management. I am seriously thinking of filing a lawsuit, this product is defective and should be recalled. How should one go about filing a lawsuit? If we can get all the e-mails of the reviewers here it would lend more support. Philips should be accountable for this highway robbery. My e-mail is asif.samad@gmail.com if anyone wants to contact so we can file a lawsuit."
1,Avoid this product,"The wise consumer will avoid this product. Ours died after 5 months of light use. The warranty was no help. The manufacturer does not give the impression that they care to support this product. Translated: ...the manufacturer does not care to support the CUSTOMER. The estimated repair cost is roughly equivalent to that of a new set. The multitude of similar reviews suggest similar fatal defects. I never would have imagined that a once-fine brand name such as Philips would one day be equated with junk. I don't think I will be a future Philips customer at any level, because a poor corporate philosopy usually affects all products."
1,Holy Mother of Garbage,"If the 22 previous reviews haven't convinced you, I'm not sure what will. I, too, bought my 27"" piece of garbage a short 4 months ago TO THE DAY when my power just uhh, stopped working. I'm going to avoid Philips customer service and repair shops all together, and just replace the fuse myself. How funny. I'M GOING TO REPLACE THE FUSE MYSELF! I'm a 23 year old post-college female trying to fix this thing myself, because I just spent a good $320 of my hard earned cash. Anyone interested in filing a class-action law suit with me against Philips? I mean, this is ridiculous. Isn't it about time for a recall?"
1,Same old song and dance.,"I don't know why I am bothering to type this, because you've already heard the same thing 20 times. I bought this TV on January 8th, and exactly 15 days after the 90 warrantee, it died. It would not power up. I am now watching my 8 year old, $99 White Westinghouse TV from Kmart. I'll be arguing with Philips customer service soon. Don't buy this piece of junk."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Apparently my first review of this product was too strongly worded to be posted by amazon. So, I'll keep this one clean. This product is garbage. It died on me in 4 months. Philips customer service is worthless. Finally, the ""authorized repairmen"" are theives. The repairman wanted $140, I fixed it with a 50 cent fuse. (4 amp, 250 volt slow blow) Philips is a dishonest company that sells defective products in bad faith. I will never buy from them again and I encourage nobody else to either. I also hope that amazon discontinues sales of this obviously defective product which is being sold by a dishonest company. I think everyone who bought this peice of junk deserves their money back."
1,10 months,"Yeah, that's right people. My quality set lasted almost twice as long as the other posters! 10 WHOLE MONTHS! YEAH! You guessed it...FUSE! I actually went out and purchased a midget and placed him inside the set so I don't have to keep taking the back off. This is working pretty well..so I might rate the set a 2 star instead."
1,Piece of Crap! DO NOT PURCHASE!,"Like the other 43 people who wrote a review, the TV is a piece of crap. I doubt it is a defect on just a few hundred, but every single one made. That is alot of wasted money! And the story about Phillips placing the wrong information on the part that is required for fix is idiotic, and seems planted. It even went on to say that the item should be available at some time which was probably conviently AFTER the warranty expired. This is the worst thing I have ever owned. I'm amazed that Amazon would still have these TV's listed for sale after piles of comments stating that this product is worthless. But, the reviews are amazing and I'm glad everyone informed everyone else, and even found a solution. THANK YOU to all you posted!"
1,TV died after 10 Months,I experienced the exact same problem as all the other reviewers. I purchased my TV in December 2004 and it stopped working in October 2005.
1,This TV is a piece of junk,"Honestly this TV deserves negative 5 stars if such a rating existed. My story is the same as the other 53+ reviews. I called phillips and they refused to pay for the repair, which I was not surprised by after reading all these reviews. I am going to get in contact with a lawyer I know to see if anything can be done. Perhaps a class action lawsuit in in order. Phillips' complete denial of this problem is not only abominable in and of itself but also illustrates the overall dishonesty of the company. I will never buy another product from Phillips... EVER!"
1,AVOID,"If you enjoy lugging your television around for repairs, by all means purchase this one. I experienced a high-pitched whining sound from the unit within two months of buying it. My repairs, although covered my warranty, were inconvenient and time-consuming -- we did not have the unit for about a month. Now, less than a year after the initial purchase and first repair, the TV no longer turns on. More repairs -- and this time, the labor won't be covered!Don't make the same mistake I did -- RESEARCH your television BEFORE you buy it! Get the model and serial number and search google or epinions.AVOID THIS TELEVISION!!"
1,you can fix it yourself!,"Thank you, thank you, thank you, to the post about buying and replacing the fuse. My tv was only out of commission for 4 days and cost <$3 to fix. Thanks to the reviews here on Amazon, I didn't bother with any of the calls or repair service companies. I bought the fuse, replaced it, and the tv is working great again. Not that this excuses Philips- they should be ashamed to have their name on this product simply from viewing this page. I do not recommend anyone purchase this television. But save yourself the hastle if you have already purchased the tv and fix it yourself."
1,Same story as the rest..............,"Just like everyone else I purchased this television and it stopped working after 6 months. I turned the TV on and no power no noise no light no nothing. I also tried different outlets with no luck, so I called customer support. Support sent me to a authorized repair shop where they would repair it for over $100.00 They deny any knowledge of this issue even after I pointed out all the reviews I saw online. So like some of the others I will try the fuse replacement as I have nothing to loose. I will never buy a Phillips made product again. This is obviously a manufacturing defect and we weren't all just ""lucky"" in purchasing a bad set. Thanks for your time."
1,Awful TV,"This TV should be rated a negative 5 and taken off the market. Why wasn't this TV recalled? I have had the same problems as every other person. I received the TV as a Birthday gift last November and it simply shut off and would not turn on about 3 weeks ago. Philips at first said that they would not cover anything b/c I did not have the receipt. However, I called them several times and complained and they were able to pay for 100% parts and 50% labor. So, because I am not able to lug this 100lb TV to be repaired it's probably going to cost me about $110. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau."
1,Ditto,"Same story... had it for 6 months, now it won't turn on. Philips has paid for some out-of-warranty repairs, especially when people go to the BBB with this complaint. Make them pay to repair this known problem, I know I'm going to."
1,TV Power problems after 2 months.,"Adding to the prior reviewers comments: My set was manufactured in Dec 04 (back of the set info). I bought a NuWA RV with this set installed on July 8, 05. It failed to turn back on on August 29, 05 so it lasted 2 months. At least this repair is within the three month warranty period! I may buy the extended warranty giving me free fuses for the next three years.OTH, the picture is great."
1,About 10 months here too,"Bought mine in December, and it just shut down tonight. This model should be recalled. The fix should at least include the labor. Nice picture when it's working."
1,Worst TV money can buy,"Paid $250 for this.Just like others reported, this TV stopped working after four months.Same old power problem .Its disappointing to see this TV on sale in all big stores.Service center wanted 30$ just to check what is wrong and give an estimate.Philips would not repair it for free and would only replace parts. We all know how expensive labor can be.I am very scared to touch another Philips.Any way I bought a Samsung 27'' HDTV by paying extra money."
4,Four Years And Still Going Strong!!!,"We purchased this television about four years ago, when I just about first started middle school, now im a freshman in High School and this television is still going strong!! Picture quality is still like it was when we first bought it, and the sound is still incredible. I guess we're part of the very few people who didn't have any problems with this model. 4/5."
1,Same story - Blown Fuse,"Same as everyone else. I've had the TV for about 2 1/2 years and I'm about to replace the fuse for the 4th time. The 4 pack only cost about $2.50, it's just getting annoying having to replace it. I won't buy a Philips product again."
1,Dead after 4 months,"I purchase this in October 2004, and it died in February 2005. We watched maybe two movies a week, and then one day it just stopped responding. This seems to be a relatively common problem (check google). Customer service was not helpful, after 90 days they no longer cover parts."
1,WARRANTY QUESTION,"So, I got this product as a gift but based on your reviews (thanks everyone) decided to return it. Unfortunately because of its size Amazon won't take it back. So does anyone know about the warranty? I mean, yes, the service will be paid for, but am I going to have to get it fixed every few months, or is once gonna do it? And if I get the warranty now, will it cover it even though the tv was purchased a few months ago? Thanks for your input!"
1,STILL JUNK!!!!!!,"got as a gift Xmas 2003, a few months later, the tv would act up and go crazy!!! so repair man (from where it was bought) came out since it was still under 1 yr store warranty. now 1 yr and 6 months later the volume is SHOT...no volume whatsoever and it is junk. DONT BUY PHILIPS AT ALL>>>>> never again!"
4,Gable and Harlow Together Again!,"""Hold Your Man"" is perfect for those of us who like Gable and Harlow together. Gable plays a small-time con man and Harlow is the current lady of his affection. Gable does a stint in the county jail for a crime, and when released, cooks up a plot using Harlow as a way to blackmail a guy out of some money. When the guy gets too fresh with her, Gable knocks him out--and kills accidentially kills him! He disappears, but poor Harlow is snagged and sent to a girls' reform school. The girls learn to cook, sew and all those skills that will make them desirable wife material once they're released. The only problem is that Harlow finds she's pregnant! She has to get married! A former rival for Gable's attention helps her out, and the movie has a classic sugar-coated ending.Gable is great and Harlow never looked better. This movie is worth your time and money, especially if you're fans of one of the silver screen's best and hottest couples!"
3,Hold Your Man/Jean Harlow (VHS),"Great service. Delivered promptly. So spoiled with the high visual quality of dvd's however, this vhs tape wasn't in too bad condition considering the movie making technology at the time this movie was made. The quality of this vhs tape would rate a 6 1/2 in my opinion. One can still see that this was and still is a great movie."
4,Two movies in one,"First a comedy and then a prison drama, this film is a string of beautifully realised set-pieces, with Harlow and Gable's characters proving that you don't have to be high-born to be noble. My favourite moment is when a drunk girl stumbles into the apartment and realises that she has been replaced - she suddenly sobers up, and talks (and walks) like Mae West! I didn't understand Mae West until I saw this. I'm a bit old fashioned in my principles, so I liked the final scenes as much as the rest of the movie. One of my favorite Harlow flicks!"
3,Weakest Harlow-Gable combination,"Although this film starts with some snap, it gets bogged down at the end. Pre-code soaper with Gable as a con and Harlow as a not-so-virtuous lady. Gable on the lamb ducks into Harlow's apartment where she hides him from the law. He seduces, she lets him then they fall in love. Later, she takes a fall for him in a con-game gone wrong. While in prison, she thinks he has forsaken her but love triumphs. Recommended for Harlow fans only. She looks great."
4,"Not what I expected, but not bad","I bought this CD in the hopes that it would be more Synthpop, but it turned out to be more trance. But this is ok, tracks 1 and 6 more then make up for the few shortcommings.Between this and the new Iris cd this is just about all I listen."
4,Trancy synthy,Great disc. Until You Say You Are is poetic. Would be five stars if a few more songs had lyrics.
5,Inspiring!!!!!,"Miss DeLoach truly got into the head of a truly remarkable man! The book has everything, facts, figures, sad and happy times - all laced with humor. Couldn't put it down!"
5,An OLYMPIA 10 all the way across the board!!!!!,"The lives of every person who reads this book will be enriched regardless of their age! The book is informative, interesting as well as entertaining! Great gift for anyone in your life! It flows as you read it and you won't want to put it down! Treat yourself to a wonderful experience!!!"
5,A hole-in-one as biz book with inspiring formula for success,"There are a lot of books out there about how to get rich. There are a few more about how to grow rich in more than money, but none of them are written by a billionaire who has done both. Robert's Rules of Order can help anyone enjoy success in business and even more important, in life. Living, loving, laughing, giving, having fun, setting up win-win relationships, being nice...it's all in this book. Entertaining reflections on a fascinating career, Robert Dedman has built fame and fortune as the founder of ClubCorp. He's the richest guy in golf, but that's not the extent of his wealth. His whole life is rich because he works at making it so. How he did it and keeps doing it will inspire anyone to set their sights high and achieve a richness in life that goes far beyong their net worth. Nobody cares what you know until they know you care. This book has it all."
1,Truly banal,"This book is a wildly self-indulgent extension of every cliche in other people's books. It's truly banal. I agree, however, with the reviewer who said it could be worthwhile ""for those who do not read a lot."""
4,Nice basic french press.,Bought this quite some time ago and still use it regularily. Basic french press but works well.
3,french coffee press,it is a bit flimsy on the feel when you start pouring the coffee. the handle doesn't feel sturdy enough
4,Good size,"I've used presses before but this was my first glass press and what a treat! It makes the right amount for what I typically drink (Two large mugs). If you have guests, it would make a nice amount for two to three people. The rich flavor is worth the purchase. I just hope the glass holds up. I'm sure I'll be replacing it sooner or later. I have no idea if I can even get just the replacement, or will I have to buy a whole new press? In other words,you really wouldnt want to carry this on a back packing trip."
5,Great coffee maker.,This makes an excellent cup of coffee and seems to be constructed well. I've been very pleased with this product. It makes bad coffee taste pretty good.
5,Bodum Coffee Press,"This is my first coffee press, which I received about 3 weeks ago. The press worked flawlessly and following the directions I easily made my first pot of coffee. I like the control I have over the coffee/water mixture, along with the ability to adjust the steeping time.Pressing the plunger down per the instructions takes 99% of the grounds to the bottom. While there are a few grounds that will make their way to the cup, they are hardly noticeable.While it is rated as a 12 cup press, a coffee hound should consider it as a 6 cup press., or less. It's rated at 51 ounces, so divide the number of ounces your regular cup holds into 51 to find the number of cups to expect.I'm very happy with my Bodum coffee press and would gladly recommend one to anybody that is shopping for one.Fred"
2,Great - until the glass cracks!,"This works flawlessly. Makes fabulous coffee. Looks great. I bought despite the many, many complaints on Amazon about the glass cracking. I figured I was forewarned, so bought it planning on taking extra care with it. Which I did. Very, very careful when cleaning. I always ran warm water in the glass to brace it for the hot water being poured in, which was never boiling. I don't know what else I could have done to prevent the long thin cracks appearing and the coffee oozing out. Went online to Bodum and the replacement glass is $25. I am switching brands, and I am going to pay more attention to Amazon comments in the future!"
5,Fantastic,"I consider myself a coffee fanatic, normally I only drink coffee from a percolater, this tops that. when you want a delicious cup of coffee, this is it!"
2,"Love the Coffee, Hate the Press","You won't beat the flavor of the coffee from the french press and the Chambord is excellent for creating great flavor. That being said, the 12-cup beaker is TOO FRAGILE! My poor kids barely look at the thing funny while doing dishes and the thing cracks.We have had to go to a dad and mom only washing because the glass is so fragile. We have now been through 3 of them with the last cracking in half while my son was drying it. I saw it happen and he didn't do anything to it to make it do that. There were no cracks in it whatsoever. Thankfully I have a 9 yr. old spare 8 cup plexiglass one that is veritably indestructible. I just wish they made the plexiglass in the 12 cup model. Hope this helps in your decisions."
4,Great Coffee Press,I have used my Bodum Coffee Press for years. It also makes great tea when using loose Teas. I have never had a problem with the glass Canister. I however always fill it with hot tap water while boiling my water for the coffee. I wouldn't trade it for any other mechanical coffee maker.
2,3rd broken Bodum,"I love coffee from the french press however, i hate having to buy a new one every month. I was a loyal Bodum Customer for the last 4 years but this is 4th Bodum that has broken since April so I finaly switching to another brand. It's either the glass or the filter plate that brakes. I loved you but it's time to leave you."
4,good coffee,"french press coffee is so good and we wanted a bigger pot. I saved $20.00 buying from Amazon rather than my local store. The first arrived broken, but Amazon shipped the second in a timely manner and returning was incredibly easy"
3,A good cup of Coffee,I purchased the Bodum Chambord Coffee Press and have used it only on a couple of times. It takes too long to prepare and brew for it to be used in the morning before I head out for work. It's good for after dinner coffee and it takes practice to get the coffee the strength that you like. It does make a very rich cup of coffee and I would purchase it again for those times when I have the time to let it brew properly.
2,Very Disapointed,"Bought almost a year ago makes excellent coffee base slides around counter need to be very carefull.mine broke when it tiped over in plasic laundry tub! replacemet beaker 19.95+ 7.95 shipping get a new onefor almost same price. Phoney discription on size 8cup which is, 1cup = 4oz.not in US.??I dont think I will replace this item with another Bodum product!"
2,"Great coffee, Poor quality glass","The coffee is very good and surpasses the same coffee brewed in most other machines. However, I have just lost my second glass beaker and Bodin's replacement (on-line, today) is $10 + shipping. Given the current track record, I think that I'll recycle the metal parts and get an alternative machine."
5,The best tasting coffee you can find,"I have been a big fan of the Bodum Chambord coffee press since 1985. I was first turned on to this simple device in a tiny french bistro in Chicago. There was a layer of foam on top of my coffee and the taste was rich and full. Since that time I have become a bit of a coffee snob. That will happen when you discover the difference between okay coffee and great coffee. Now I grind my own beans daily and only use a french press. No comparison to automatic drip makers. No filtering between the coffee and boiling water is the key. They live together till brewing is finished and you just seperate the grounds from the coffee prior to drinking. If you don't mind the inconvenience of cleaning this unit after each use it is awesome. Even though they call it a 12 cup press, it is actually a four cup press unless you use tiny coffee cups."
5,I love my coffee,"This was a great investment, and I use it every day to make all the coffee I drink. It is a whole lot better than the 8 cup for getting me all I want to drink."
4,"Owned it for a year, use it every morning.","We have owned this coffee maker for year, and quite seriously use it every single workday morning. It is fast, easy, and makes an amazing pot of coffee.As some other reviews have mentioned, the glass is really the worst part of this product. It is very thin, and sometimes even setting it down on the counter it sounds as though it will break. You really need to be careful with it, and I wish the manufacturer would make something that wasn't so flimsy. If you don't have a delicate hand, definitely look elsewhere, because this thing will shatter on you in a heartbeat.It has the added bonus that you don't need to run vinegar through it to clean it, and thus you never have to deal with that horrible smell of cleaning coffee pots.Complaints aside, it really is a fantastic coffee maker, and I definitely recommend it."
5,Solid French Press,"This is a very well-made french press. I don't think coffee should be made any other way, and this is a good buy and a quality product."
3,buy the Frieling stainless steel instead,"I've owned every different type of coffee maker possible over the years and the French press if used correctly is my favorite. I have had a few Bodum ones and they were the best UNTIL I found the Frieling stainless steel 35 Ounce French press. This is an improvement as significant as the automobile over the horse and buggy. The stainless steel keeps the coffee hot, and they are no more broken glass beakers. It is also a fabulous looking piece. For a few bucks more you'll be much happier. By the way there are 2 different size models. Go with the bigger one as they are very close in size."
2,The Glass Ain't What It Used To Be,"We only had the Bodum Chambord maybe two weeks and had a couple of issues with it: the screw that holds the top together came loose and we could have easily lost the screw but it popped out and landed where we could spot it. No easy feat to rethread and line up the screw. The metal holder that the carafe sets in is not a tight fit so the glass carafe easily slips out and if you are not careful when you tip an empty carafe, the glass will slip out and break (which it did with us when we were emptying out a few stray coffee grounds into the sink. We used to have a smaller Bodum and that glass carafe seemed stronger and thicker. The recent ones seem fragile.So, we are switching to the stainless steel French presses made by another company. But I was a die-hard Bodum fan so I even reordered a Bodum Chambord since the glass carafe for a 51 oz was not available. I came to my senses; it's time for a change.Good service by Amazon and good return policy."
5,French Press,"For any coffee lover you have to have one of these!!! Quick, easy, best coffee I have ever brewed!! Easy cleanup and storage. Ready to go at any time. I love it."
4,Little Dreams,Got this for my 4 year old granddaughter after the Olympics. She loved it so much that she called me immediately (with Mommy's help) to thank me. She still uses it and even gets her grandfather to demonstrate his ribbon technique. I love watching her play with it!
3,Dissapointment,I ordered these ribbons for my 11 year granddaughter who was asking for them. She was thrilled when they arrived. After twrilling them around with a friend for less than an hour they started to unravel and continued to do so until they were unusable. It was very frustrating for the children. Do not waste your money.
5,Ribbon Sticks,"Excellent for pageants. Fun for children and adults. Great for recess and classrooms, especially music and gym classes."
1,Disappointing Quality,Purchased this for my 4yr old niece as I had one when I was her age. She opened on Christmas and it was already fraying badly and falling apart by the time we left her house at 4pm that day! I'll be sending this one back! Didn't even last 12 hours!
2,Not my style,"This book is not my style too wordy and there is really no reference to the code examples, its problematic especially when they dont work. Probably a good book if you've worked with older versions of ADO and know your way around. I'm going back to ADO.NET step by step - its boring but at least I can get the samples working."
2,This book is a disappointment,"If you only do two-tier client/server development, and you want a repetitious, backward-looking overview of ADO.NET written in ""Hitchhiker"" style...this book is for you.If you want definitive Best Practices for how to program ADO.NET for n-tier, Windows Forms and Web Services, you'll need to look elsewhere."
1,Not a best practices book,"This is a ""for dummies"" book masquerading as a best practices book. It is also a ""for people who think Vaughn is as funny as he does"" book, as well as a ""for people who want to know more about ADO classic than they do about ADO.NET, which would be odd considering the title"" book and a ""for VB programmers who find C# as confusing as Vaughn does"" book.Waste of money. Vaughn is an inept C# programmer and a lousy writer."
5,MUSIC FOR YOUR SOUL,"What a beautiful collection of music from the movie, ""The Merchant of Venice"". It is the first CD I listen to each time I get into my car. Every track is unbelievably moving, from the Jewish songs to the mid-evil voices and strings. Some are haunting and others, uplifting...always leaves me wanting more of the same.This music is great for meditation or will calm you in rush hour traffic. The lyrics are exceptional and are written by John milton, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Luys de Narvaez and Clara Sanabras."
5,"Wonderfully made, adds to tea time enjoyment","This elegant tea infuser is just what you need for loose tea leaves, especially the green tea that is sold with instructions to rinse clean the first brew. The design is functional and the 3 prong stand is stable. It is just right for two cups of tea. And with green tea you can make several brews, so that in between brews, you can easily lift out the inner basket with the metal handle. I got [it] here at Amazon, ..."
4,An hilarious homage to the not-so-eloquent former president,"When it comes to public speaking, most modern presidents have their speeches written for them. But when the time arrives for them to speak their own thoughts, take cover. In ""Bushisms"", the editors of the 'New Republic' have collected some choice examples of the 41st president's sometimes incomprehensible, often hilarious words of wisdom. A sample: ""When I need some free advice about Saddam Hussein, I turn to country music."" You may not believe this phrase and others far more zany were spoken by the commander-in-chief, but you will be rolling on the floor in laughter"
2,Bought this by mistake,"I though this was George W's gaffes, but it turns out his father mispoke quite a bit himself. A little bit too politically motivated, these people obviously had no idea how much worse things could get when his son would be elected, er, annointed, or ah, democratically- you know what I mean!"
2,Skip this book!,"When one reads a ""Guide"" Book, one should not have to read nearly 100 pages to find something negative; After all, it is a foreign country and what to avoid is actually more beneficial than the ""Oh,it is all wonderful"" descriptions. There is very little mention of the different regions; However there is extensive information on every lodging place in the country. How this has received 4.5 stars is certainly a mystery to me. Evidently from reading ""Trip Advisors"" on the internet; everyone in Costa Rica has the Lonely Planet guide on Costa Rica!"
4,Very Nice !,"This painting is the inspiration for the Don Mcclean song from the 1970's, called, ""Vincent"". Some might know it by the name ""Starry, Starry Night"". It's actually a real nice reproduction and, it's on surprisingly good paper. I have seen the painting in New York' Metropolitan Museum of Art. It doesn't rate with the painting, of course, but it IS a reproduction."
2,Leave this book at the store,"I knew I was in trouble with this book when the author said she could not be bothered with European train schedules and therefore provided NO information about train travel with kids. Instead, there are pages about buying a car to avoid rental prices! Our trip was train-based and we highly recommend the trains. We left this book and all its irrelevant information at home, and recommend you do too."
3,Baseball Legends Roberto Clemente,"The book about Roberto Clemente is explaning to you that he can be placed at the top of the greatest baseball players list. I think that if you are a baseball fan you will be able to understand the book a lot more than others. Somehings that you might get out of this book or tha you might learn about this person is that he had an 307 lifetime batting average, he was 15th on the all time home run list, he was one of the best outfeilders to play for the pittsburg pirates, he was one of many to play in the Babe Ruth error, he was also one of the greatest hitters in the league at that time with more than 3000 hits.RODNEY D"
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"The material is very good and more versatile than leather. Looks good for casual or business attire. The phone fits perfectly and it still looks good. There is no chance of the phone falling out of the case. It also protects the face very well. However it covers the volume button on the side. But I can still easily adjust the volume through the material. Also you have to open the bottom flap to charge. Which is simple enough, but it would be easier if there was a hole cut for it. There is a hole for the headset, though. The clip for your belt or pocket is perfect. Good product. But don't get this case unless you intend to use it with the clip. Unless you don't ming the button sticking out in the back (which holds it to the belt-clip)."
2,No Holes for Accessories,"This looks sharp and feels sharp but it is not good for a person on the go. The Swivel clip is smaller that most and does not secure very well. The main thing I found wrong with this is accessory holes. No hole where you plug in hands free and the hole for power is misaligned, and one hole for Volume control."
1,"Poor Quality, Costly Repair","Just passed one year warrant period, the eye piece viewfinder didn't work anymore. It seems that the sensor for the foldable screen went bad. Sent back to California Canon service center, and was charged for [money]. The customer service agent was very arrogant about Canon quality, and showed no sign of concern for my problem.Recently half of screen became distorted during replay. Don't want to waste another [money], so tried lots of cleaning and changed the tape from TDK to Sony. The problem seems to be under control.If it goes bad again, I will trash this junk, and buy a Sony."
1,Features Don't Make for Reliability,"This product worked fine for a few months of light use. Then, during playback, the Optura Pi started adding image and audio noise to the tapes. One treasured video partially ruined."
3,"Great DV Video, especially for DV editing","A great amateur DV camera, downloads to your PC for video editing and compilation work great. Just make sure your PC is up to snuff in terms of processor, memory and hard drive space...video takes a LOT!"
4,Classic workhorse microphone,"I think I first saw/heard this mic in the original Concert for Bangladesh, and could not get over how cool it looked. Typically, I wouldn't consider buying such a thing based on appearance consideration, but the fact that George Harrison and Leon Russell felt them worthy, I considered it a safe purchase. To say the least, I was amazed by this mic. As a producer, I've used it for everything from vocals to horns to acoustic guitar - even capturing cymbal nuances that were lost on other more expensive mics. Live or in the studio, this mic is a serious performer that no performer or studio should be without - several, if budget allows. You won't run out of uses for it. The one down-side is that, over time, the frequency response goes dead (like any mic), but this can be factory-refurbished back to original specs. The mic comes with a graph read-out of your mic's unique response characteristics."
3,Good basic book,This is a good basic book for beginners in martial arts. If you have advanced training then you already know what's in the book.
4,Persuasive defense of Conservative Activism,"Ralph Reed's ""Active Faith"" is effective in refuting the attacks against Christian Conservative ""activism"" (i.e. speaking out about issuses just as all other Americans have the right to do) that seem to be on the rise recently (especially after the re-election of President Bush). For that reason, the book is timely, even though it was written about a decade ago. Reed's critics may not like him any better after reading his book, but his fair minded critics would have to give him credit for being much more fair and thoughtful than those who demonize Reed and other ""activist"" Christian Conservatives would have us believe."
1,The Christian Right is neither,"I see nothing in this book that has any connection to the unconditional love Christ preached about, and even less that resembles the life which he led.How can Reed ignore that Jesus stood with the poor and against the social structures that keep them that way - the same social structres Reed and his followers work night and day to keep?"
2,"Flimsy, will not hold up larger books","These ""bookends"" are flimsy and will not hold up larger books or stay put on a desk (they slide). If you have smaller books or magazines, they may work."
4,Perfect for the price,Got this for the kitchen to hold up the cooking books that we have. There is not much space and i was using the knife block and the mixer to hold them up before. This was perfect to fit the tight spot and make so the books don't fall over when you grab a knife or another book. You can tell its not meant for books much bigger but it works perfect for what I need.
3,Decent Book Ends,"I ordered these books ends to keep the textbooks on my desk at school shoved neatly to one side of my desk. However, unless I placed my heaviest textbook at the end of the stack to anchor the bookend, my books just slide down (though not as bad as before the bookends). I would recommend these bookends for lightweight books only, not dictionaries or textbooks (as you can probably see, they're not that tall, which could be part of the problem). However, the bookends are lightweight, durable, and slim, matching most decors."
1,Stunning Parties?,"My guests would be stunned if I served a soup of frozen peas and cream or a chicken curry made with canned soup? Yukkk! There are some interesting decorating tips...glueing your plates and bowls together to create differing heights on the buffet. And, of course, we get the ""wonderfully entertaining"" pictures of MR. Lowell at the beginning of each chapter. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
3,A very nice shirt,I was really surprised that the bowtie did NOT come with the shirt. For the price I paid I wasn't really mad about it.
4,Tuxedo Shirt with Laydown Collar and Convertable Front & Cuff,"This Tuxedo Shirt with Pintuck (pleat) and Laydown Collar with Convertable Front and Cuff was a sure thing for me as any Tuxedo Product by Neil Allyn is always top drawer. I had previously ordered the Neil Allyn - Wing or Stand-up Collar Tuxedo Shirt with 1/4"" Pleat and it was better than any other Manufactured Tuxedo Shirt that I have ever owned before. The only problem I had with this Vendor is the Delivey Time was 10 days due to a late shipment and if I had received in 11 days it would have been to late for the Formal I was attending (ordered a Vest and Tie from this Vendor and it was shipped by a Sub-Vendor immediately via the same mail system and I received it in 3 days!!"
3,Size selection misleading,"After passing over many cheap tux shirts that were offered in size S/M/L/XL/2XL available on the internet, I chose to take a chance on this one, because the web page offered actual size selections based on neck size and sleeve length. I need a 16-1/2 35 shirt, which falls somewhere between L and XL. L is too small and XL is too big. I was very disappointed when they sent me this shirt in size L. I contacted the seller and they explained that this shirt is not available by neck size like they advertised. They look at the size you order, and send you the size they think is the best approximation of what you ordered. Had I known this up front, I never would have placed the order. I returned the shirt and received a full refund, but I got stuck for the return shipping. I think the size selection on the web page is very misleading."
3,It met the need,"The presentation of this shirt on the website led me to believe that it had french cuffs. It did not. However since I needed it within a particular time period I had to use it. The price was fair and the quality is okay. The shirtfront, along with the studs that were included also has buttons. I removed them because they made a slight bulge in the shirtfront with the studs installed."
5,prommom,This shirt washed nicely and fit well. No problems with size of neck. We needed a 16 1/2 neck and ordered a large shirt and it was perfect.
5,I Love the Slade Family and Friends,"I loved all the books that intergraded with each other. I love reading about the Slades, The Savages, Adam St. Clair, Brett Dangermond, and Royce Manchester. I was able to read a little about each of them in each others books. It was great. Morgan and Leonie Slade are my favorite."
2,"cool look, but doesnt work correctly","I dont know if it is a technical difficulty on my part, but my past shifter that lit up would rotate colors automatically every time i shifted gears or pressed the button, this one, you have to hold down the button, HARD, if you want to colors to come on, and the minute you release the button, no more colors. Besides that, i dont mind too much because i like just the bubbly design without the colors, just wished the product had been designed so you didnt have to hold the button down for the colors to stay on. If I am doing this wrong or there is a special technique to keep it on, someone please tell me. :)"
3,shift knob,"if you dumbasses would read the directions that come in the package with the shift knob you would understand that you have to remove the button that allows you to try the colors out and take off a small white plastic ring for your product to work.. wow. although i got MINE to work, i didnt like the way it fit in my car, it was to long and had alot of glitches in the colors.smh."
2,"Sharks 2.0 is O.K,............... just O.K","Sharks 2.0 is O.K, the fish(all sharks)are nice, but you don't have the feeling that you have a fish tank on your desk as with Marine Aquarium 2.5,Sharks 2.0 is like watching TV. The colors in Sharks 2.0 are 'drab and weak'as oppose to Marine Aquarium 2.5,which are fanastic.If you like moving, boring,un-exciteing sharks, there are many kinds to see here. Hey! They should 'program in' a 'shark attack' or 'frenzy feeding'or something to give Sharks 2.0 some spark and life."
5,In my WW1 Top Ten,"Approaching the centenary of the First World War, the 'War to end all Wars', this is one of the must reads in my top ten. Recommended by many others, not least Professor Peter Simkin of the Imperial War Museum and Western Front Association. This is an excellent tonic to narratives, memoirs and panegyrics."
4,Good Odds and Ends Collection,"Some fine rock and roll here, as usual. Coffee Monkey is my favorite pick, but I was a true coffee addict at the time. Recommended for any Bottle Rockets fan!"
1,Waterproof?,I put a floatation strap on these binoculars and placed them in fresh water for perhaps 30 seconds to test for bouyancy. I then packed them for a western trip that included a five day float trip. When I unpacked them one tube was completely obscured with water droplets. Within a half hour in the sun the other tube was fogged beyond use.
5,Great Pocket Sized DigiCam!,"I feel that a great number of compact digicam ratings are too low, as the reviewer is comparing them to a digital SLR. My rating of 5 stars is based on the fact that the FinePix F700 is a small pocketable COMPACT digital camera. I've made around 800 images,thus far and am very pleased with the image quality(even producing some fine 11""X 14"" prints.I use the Fujifilm S2 Pro SLR digital with Nikon lens most of the time,but wanted a digital camera that would fit in my pocket and therefore be available at all times.I find for it's size the F700 to be a GEM in every sense. The Fujinon lens is very sharp,the dynamic range is outstanding,start up time and frame to frame speed is the best for any compact that I know of.Shutter lag that plagues compact digital cameras,has been greatly improved in the FinePix F700.IF YOUR STILL IN DOUBT as to whether the F700 is the digicam for you...check out George Schaub's glowing review of the F700 in the Feb.2004 issue of SHUTTERBUG magazine."
3,Nice...but disappointing,"My previous digital camera was a Fuji 4700 and I just knew the F700 would be the best of all digital camera worlds, but it wasn't meant to be.It fits in your pocket with ease and has a nice size screen for viewing and menu commands. As for pictures, it generated great outdoor photos, but that's it.Indoor shots were always fuzzy regardless of who was snapping the picture or light conditions. I use the camera for work, so I have one chance to capture images and can't afford poor quality photos. I returned it after just 10 days.Come on Fuji.....you can do better than this."
1,Breaks down very easily,"I have bought one Finepix F700 and it broke down after about 3 months. The pictures it takes are completely blurred, out of focus and yellowish. After making some researches I discovered that a few other buyers have had the same problem. You can make your deductions by yourself, I won't buy another one for sure."
1,"Zero stars, if I could","Just like other Amazon reviewers, we really enjoyed this camera for the first ten months of ownership at which time it broke. I contacted Fuji and they responded with artificial surprise at my complaint and stated that they'd never heard of such a malfuction with the F700. At that time, I began doing some simple online research and found HUNDREDS of consumers who had identical experiences. The camera still functions but the images are completely distorted by a pattern of purple, black, and white bars. Several reviewers exclaimed that they were told by some independent repair shops that the problem is very common to Fuji and 'not worth fixing'. I will be very unlikely to buy another Fuji product, EVER."
3,Video mode a problem: card space and sound quality,"I bought this camera not because of the claimed 6MP quality because it looked like it had a number of features I liked: quick setup, a balance between auto and programmable features, a docking station, rechargeable battery. But I really fell for the high-quality movie mode for as long as the card holds out. However, I have to say that this is a problem, as the movie mode is so high quality that the card is instantly full - I bought a separate 128 MB card, which stores about 2.5 minutes of video at the LOW resolution mode before it's full - not enough for anything! I haven't even bothered with high resolution. And the sound quality is very bad, a lot of noise. Other than that, the camera is solidly built, feels good, looks great and is easy to use."
1,Collecting Dust,"What a piece of junk! I got this camera from another retailer two years ago. The first year and a half it worked great. The pictures were clear and sharp, the colors bright. It was a good web cam also.Then one day it stopped working outdoors. The pictures are nothing but white. Not even the photo editing software can get rid of the whiteness. I thought it was just me but a little research has yielded hundreds of orther horror stories about this camera and Fuji's unwillingness to fix the problem..Save your money."
3,Disappointed,"I was pleased when I first found this CD and had not been aware that it had been released in CD format. Since I am both a big Johnny Hodges and Gerry Mulligan fan, I thought I was going to hear great music.Once I listened to it several times I was greatly disappointed as none of the tunes really impressed me and the potential of their meeting did not create the fire one would have expected."
4,A True Guitar 70's Classic,"This 2 CD long play set is a great guitar instrumental collection of 44 cover songs of the 70's. As you listen you go back in time. If you are a Venture's fan, this is a must. If you are new to the Venture's, this will make you a fan. I also reccomend ""Walk-Don't Run the Ventures All-Time Greatest Hits."""
5,Bodum Chambord 8 Cup French Coffee Press,"This coffee press is fabulous! I bought this as a Valentine's Day prsent for my husband who is a coffee fanatic. He had always wanted a coffee press, but since I don't drink coffee, I really had no clue what was the best one to buy. I believe this may be the one. He absolutley loves it! When he opened it up, his eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas and he immediately made himself some coffee. Apparently it is very easy to use as well as clean up. He said the coffee was delicious, and I know he is crazy about it by the way he so meticulously washed it afterwards. It is dishwasher-safe, but he wants to make sure nothing happens to it, so he hand-washed it. It has a very special place on our kitchen counter and it looks very classy. Very good purchase and we both highly recommend it!"
5,Worth the work!!!!,"It troubles me to see everyone complaining about the work involved in using the Bodum press. First of all, it really is not that complicated. And second, and more importantly, sometimes a little extra effort is necessary to get good results... GREAT results in this case! So seriously, get over the thing about the work. This item is not hard to use, and the coffee that it makes is out of this world fantastic!"
2,An Ephemeral Product,"A beautiful display piece for my countertop, however, I purchased it to make good coffee. I am a very experienced coffee press user and was disappointed to learn first-hand how fragile this item really is. After only two uses, the top of the beaker broke (one triangular piece of glass and a pressure crack) upon plunging. This was deeply saddening as it made decent coffee. For $40.00, I expected a much better product. For the record, this product either needs a much stronger beaker (that can withstand some pressure and last awhile) or should be removed from the market altogether."
3,Too fragile for my use,"A decent french press, works as advertised. But this morning I made the mistake of brushing the tip of my brita pitcher against the edge of the pour spout on my french press. After hearing the sickening crunch of the spout breaking off I'm out one french press.Seems a little overpriced for what you get - for my replacement I'm trying another brand to see if they can make a more sturdy pitcher."
1,Will burn you!,"I have owned a Bodum Brazil Coffee press and had no complaints, but thought I didn't need it anymore and sold it in a garage sale. I found the Bodum Chambord and purchased it. That was a mistake! It is difficult to clean, the filter does a terrible job, and the coffee pours very slowly (unlike the video demo. shown here). In fact, the water did not pour out of the spout very well, but it did pour out of the pot onto my hand! I wouldn't recommend this Bodum coffee press, but did have a great experience with the Brazil Bodum press."
3,Not Enough!,"I bought the ""8"" cup coffee press before Christmas to replace a press that had broken.To me eight cups was plenty; however, I did not realize that the definition of a cup was four ounces. This may be correct for cooking, but when you pour a cup of coffee you expect more.If I knew that the press was this small, I would not have purchased it. At the time a larger model was not offered.I now have to purchase the larger one to handle my needs.I would recomend that Amazon use a more realistic description for those of us who are not that familar with measurements."
4,Bodum Chambord Coffee Press,The coffee is as good if not better than from a local Seattle coffee shop. It would have a lot nicer if the capacity was a couple of cups larger.
1,"Beware, the glass breaks easily and can cut deeply!","I have purchased two of these Bodum French presses. The first time, the glass shattered in my hand as I was washing it, and a piece of it severely cut my hand. I thought this was a fluke, and bought another one. Once again, a large piece of the glass broke off before I even washed it, and cut my finger. I will never again purchase one of these, as the glass, or whatever material it really is, is way too thin, fragile and prone to breakage to be safe. Buyer beware!"
3,Muddy tasting coffee,"Followed the directions, used coarse ground coffee and was very disappointed with the taste and quality of the coffee. All I can say is it came out ""muddy"" and was not the clean, crisp, good quality coffee I thought I would get.I used good quality coffee beans and I have bought so many coffee makers over the years that I think I am just going to spend the $$$ on a Technivorm. I am tired of the disappointment factor and will go with a handmade, high quality product made in the Netherlands."
4,Beaker should be stronger,I really like the coffee this makes. It's simple and attractive as well but it would be better if the glass beaker was a little thicker. I've only had mine about 2 months. This morning I tapped the plastic measuring spoon on the side of the beaker to shake off the grounds and the beaker broke!Now I have to buy another beaker which is half the cost of the original purchase.
4,Broken Dreams...,"Well my significant other constantly reminds me of how I made her leave her french press in London when we moved to California. So as part of her Mother's Day gift I bought this one based on the reviews. It looked much nicer than the one she left behind as well.Well on Mother's Day she opens it up, and I had bought some nice turkish coffee to go with, and lo and behold, the glass beaker was shattered into a million pieces. Shocking to say the least, especially since it's made of pyrex or similar shock/heat resistant glass. So I had to return it to Amazon, and not wanting to ruin the gesture, I went to Cost Plus and bought the exact same press (it was $4 more, plus tax, so say $7 more).The replacement one works very well and she loves it, so I give it a four star rating despite not actually getting it from Amazon. I did get my refund from Amazon within a week or returning the broken item."
5,Really 4 cups,"I'm happy with my purchase. This is a standard french press. Just remember that ""8 cups"" equals 4 regular cups of coffee at most."
4,Bodum Chambord French Press,I love this product. The reason I gave it 4 stars is the glass turns inside the chrome frame which makes it a bit challenging to pour out the spout. It is a very minor thing. I have tried to tighten it but to no avail. Other than that it makes great coffee and is a high quality product. I would recommend it to friends.
4,Better than a drip coffee maker,"I use this thing every day. Looks and feels very high-quality, like it might last a very long time. Once you get the hang of it, it makes a consistently great cup of coffee, better than any drip coffee maker. Make sure you use coarsely ground beans, otherwise the coffee can get kind of gritty. The only way you're getting 8 cups of coffee out of this thing is to use it twice. It only makes 4 cups, which is why I'm only giving 4 stars."
1,"breaks easily, glass VERY brittle","This worked nicely for the 2 weeks it lasted. I barely tapped the glass part against the sink when washing and it broke, I could hardly believe it. It costs $25 plus shipping, nearly as much as the whole thing, to replace the beaker."
1,poorly contructed,"the metal frame does not tighten around the glass, I tried to screw it in tighter, but it would not tighten to hold the glass in place, ttnx, bill perreault p.s. I b ought one 2 years ago, and it was of much better quality, I only had broken the glass."
3,Shop Around,"I had been wanting a French Press for a long time. I had looked in local coffee houses and on line and was torn between this Bodum Chambord 8-Cup and one on another site that had a seal on top for keeping the heat in longer. I went with this one, because of price, received it, made the coffee, and of course, there is no way to drink 8 cups of coffee before it was soon room temperature. But the real disappointment was going to Target the next day for unrelated items and seeing this EXACT model for $20 less in price. I was really kicking myself for dropping the $40 on this product."
5,Luddite coffee !,"This low tech cottee press is very well made , and makes outstanding coffee .It is very easy to use and very easy to clean . Be sure to use high quality beans thatyou grind yourself . Treat yourself to a little morning coffee ritual . Slow down andsmell the coffee ."
1,Not for use with hot water.,"The screen at the bottom of the plunger is attached to some sort of black plastic collar on the shaft. The collar gives the coffee a little plastic taste, and ultimately developed cracks from heat and age, and finally broke. Now, the whole thing is useless. Replacing the plunger would just subject me to the same bad taste and failure.It has been replaced with a La Cafetiere. It is all metal, is lower priced, and has a lower price for a replacement carafe."
1,Coffee doesnt taste good,"I grind my own coffee bean using eight'o'clock french roast. Placed 5 tablespoons of coffee and 20 oz of cooled down boiled water. Let it sit for 5 minutes, press the filter down and poured it out into a cup. First thing I noticed is there is not a nice aroma coming from my cup. Even my keurig has a stronger coffee aroma coming from it! Why would I waste time using this and cleaning it when a keurig is quicker and tastes better? It doesnt make any sense. If I could I would return it."
1,Makes horrible coffee,"This thing makes some of the worst coffee I've ever had. I tried everything you can think of to make good coffee and the results were Horrible! I used the same coffee, used different measurements, I varied water temperatures, varied the brew times. Then I returned it it for refund."
1,"It's not 8-Cups, it's only 4","I don't know where the rest of you went to school but a US CUP is 8Oz not 4Oz.. This states it's a ""8-Cup Coffee Maker"" so it should hold 64OZ of hot water.. ""NOT"" if you look just below the picture of the sales page it says ""Product Features; Brews 32 ounces of coffee;"" But the fact is you can't even get 32Oz in it.. You can only get 24OZ And I have pointed that fact out to Amazon at least 8 times, and yet there it still is.. A complaint was filed with the US Federal Trade Commission and the State Attorney Generals office.. It's a rip odd plain and simple.. But it dose male a great 4-Cup coffee maker."
1,Not a Happy Camper!,"I ordered an 8 cup coffee press and recieved a 3 cup coffee press. I e-mailed them and told them what happened and he was quick to get back with me and assure me that an 8 cup coffee press was on the way. A few days later I recieved another 3 cup coffee press! I notified via e-mail that I recieved yet another 3 cup coffee press. To this day Jan 16, 2007 I still do not have an 8 cup coffee press. I am not satisfied. And they have yet to contact me back."
5,Works As Expected,"May take a little getting used to regarding strength/taste you're looking for. I actually use more coffee now than with a drip maker (not sure if that is typical or not). Please note the other posts related to number of cups. Personally, I don't think this is an issue. You don't get 12 cups from a 12 cup Mr. Coffee maker either unless they are very small cups.This 32 oz. unit will make a maximum of 3 mugs which works for me."
4,LOVE IT,"Love this french press...our first one, and likely only one. We had made some of the best coffee ever with this guy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it is kind of annoying for us to clean the grounds out of after use. We can't dump them down the sink so we have to use a spatula or spoon to scrape them out. Small price to pay for fabulous, easily made coffee though!"
4,THE PUREST TASTE OF COFFEE,"Until I bought my Bodum french press coffee pot, I had forgotten howpure and smooth coffee should taste - no acidic after taste! Love it, love it, love it! Now my current difficulty is find coffee beans that I can grind to my desired coarseness!"
2,Dissappointed with quality of product,"I researched this french press before buying it. Consumer reviews were very positive. When I received the press I was extremely disappointed. The metal frame that surrounds the glass carafe was poorly made and not flush with the carafe. The metal was lopsided and contorted. When I placed the press on a flat surface it would wobble because the metal feet were not properly bent. The actual press itself was flimsy and not worth the 39.99 that I paid. In the photos on the internet it looked very sturdy and durable. I don't know if this was just a flaw in the production or if this is the standard of quality that is used to make this press. I immediately sent the press back without using it and got my full refund. The company was extremely efficient, picking up the press from my house, and refunding me promptly."
5,Great for CHOFFY too!!!,I had been using the cheap Mr. Coffee french press when I decided it's time to splurge. I found the reviews on Bodum french press very convincing as most people rated it 5 stars.I am a distibutor for Choffy and Choffy is 100% cocoa beans. It is roasted and ground and to be able to make a full flavored choffy drink it is best to use a french press. I found that Bodum french press does a wonderful job and brings out all the good stuff from the cocoa beans.CHOFFY is a deliciously brewed chocolate drink it is like drinking your favorite coffee but without the jitters and headaches the caffeine gives you.[...]
2,I like my old one better,I bought it because I broke my last one.I works but I don't like it much comparing with my old one.The handle part is a bit lose holding the glass pot. so the glass pot turns around a lot. You may pour your coffee outside of your cup if you didn't notice it; The insert part has a big unnecessary black hard-plastic top sorta works as another filter maybe? It's difficult to clean and it's redundant and ugly; I didn't check all over the place for the prices but I think it's quite pricey!
1,Not enough information about the product,"When I ordered the item, I expected it to be a 48 oz., 8-cup coffee press. When it arrived, it seemed rather small and upon further examination of the box, the ""8-cup"" refers to European coffee cups which are 4 oz. in capacity, whereas American cups size is 6 oz. This should have been noted in the product description on the site. I returned the item because it was too small for my needs, and as a result, I had to buy it from the manufacturer at full price since the larger version was not offered on the Amazon site."
1,Bodum Chambord 8 Cup Coffee Press,"Wow, what a pain this thing is to operate! I have used it exactly once. It made an ok cup of coffee, but no way is it worth all the effort you have to go through. Give me my regular coffee maker anytime! Maybe I am just not enough of a coffee expert."
5,Speedy Delivery,"I ordered the french press in the afternoon on a weekday. I selected the free delivery, which was to be sent within a week or so. It arrived the next day! Unfortunately it was discovered in the recycling bin outside the house, but I can't be positive if the delivery person put it in there or someone else placed it in there..."
3,Not what I expected,"I ground my coffee as ""French Press"" but I still got too many solids in my cup. The coffee tastes good but expect a gritty texture like a cup of mud. The device doesn't provide a way to keep the coffee hot. If you want a second cup, it may be cold. I don't know if you can place this on a burner. I takes more effort to clean up this system. Next time I buy beans, I'll try grinding them even courser than the French Press setting."
3,"Good tool, not very good coffee","I like the use and quickness of using this product. However, the coffee does not taste very good. I feel it's better to get something more expensive but also something that produces better tasting results."
3,Disappointing compared to my old Bodum 12 oz.,"I have a Bodum 12 oz French press that's served me well for years, so when I decided I wanted a larger French press, I had my mind made up as to which brand to buy. This unit has been a huge let-down compared to the smaller unit. The filter doesn't seem to fit the press well, so every cup has some wayward coffee grounds in it. The frame is also a little bent so it doesn't sit evenly on the counter. After a month, I was finally getting used to these annoyances when the carafe broke; it tipped over in the sink for an anti-climactic demise. For the frustration I've had with this thing, I'd at least have wished for the satisfaction of actually *dropping* the darn thing.I'd recommend you look elsewhere for a durable or quality coffee press."
5,How coffee is supposed to be prepared...,I purchased this a couple months ago now and love it. It makes a much better coffee than my old Mr. Coffee drip maker. Amazing how much better the coffee can be (even using the same beans) with a process of brewing it. You can notice more of the oils and textures of coffee. Sure it takes a little more effort...but for those who desire quality over convenience...this is the coffee maker for you. Highly recommend.
2,Too fragile and not sturdy,"I liked this french press until I realized that the metal housing did not fit the glass beaker as tight as I would have wanted. The overall functionality of the press is good - no complaints, however I think they could have made it much better. If they would have somehow sealed the metal housing or put some sort of notch on the glass, like a rim or something, under the metal so that it can't come out unless you pull it, it would have been much better.I had the press for about 30 days before it broke. I was washing it and it tilted upside down, the glass beaker fell on the tile floor and bounced a few times and BAM, all over the floor was the glass that was once my french press :( ."
3,Coffee Press,Bought this press as a replacement for an older Bodum press that cracked. The press handle and metal cage is much cheaper than the previous press but otherwise works. Disappointed that the previous high quality has been downgraded.
1,How to clean this contraption,I saw the rave reviews and I bought this a short while ago. I am wondering whether this is dishwasher safe or how to clean this without leaving any coffee residue in the mesh and the mesh casing. Anybody has any advise. As far as I know good coffee can be made only with very clean utensils.
1,Breaks Easy at Metal to Glass Contact,"Breaks Very Easy at Metal to Glass Contact. Bad Buy.Bought other press (Bodum Brazil 8 cup French Press Coffee Maker, 34 oz, Black.) Works well."
3,I can only give it three...,"...for two reasons. 1 - french press coffee uses more coffee than most other methods, which can be expensive, especially if you like fine coffee. 2 - the screen filter leaves an amount of coffee sediment in the bottom of my cup. That being said, the french press makes one of the best-tasting cups of coffee you can make at home. And this model is a standard in the industry. I recommend it. More or less, its the method itself and the filter which are the only drawbacks."
3,Pour spout dribbles,"I bought this carafe as a gift. The recipient who had highly anticipated it was let down somewhat by the way it pours. She said that it is slow and dribbles coffee. Given the cost, it should be an improvement over the original design. All in all, I'd stick with the regular Bodum design. The double-walled version seems problematic."
4,effective,"This is the first french press that I have purchased, and I am quite pleased with it. The coffee that it makes it much better than the 4 cup Mr. Coffee drip machine that it has replaced.The carafe seem a bit fragile so I am trying to be careful with it after all the reports of breakage reported by fellow reviewers."
1,Glass cracks too easily.,"When we received the press, the glass was cracked. Got a new one, within three days this glass cracked also. Last one we had lasted about 6 mo. Then the glass cracked."
1,Broke after three uses,"I gave this press to my sister for Christmas, and she informed me that the glass shattered upon adding hot (not even boiling) water after only three uses. Considering that the whole point of this product is to brew coffee in hot water, the glass should be able to withstand hot temperatures without shattering. A major design flaw, and the warranty does not cover the glass."
4,Bodum French Press through Amazon,I bought this item to replace the French press I had for a number of years and liked. This replacement is fine except for one feature. My original French press' internal coffee press could be dismantled for cleaning. This version came with a press mechanism that can't be dismantled making it more difficult to clean the filter piece used to squeeze the coffee from the grinds. This is an important fault.
5,Great product,"I needed a cheap, reliable coffee maker and this was just the fit. I was a bit scared of breaking it the first time I tried to make coffee due to all the reviews of people previously doing so, but the press is quite sturdy (still, it is made out of glass after all and you should be careful with it). The beaker is removable from the stainless steel stand, so handwashing it is very easy."
5,Amazingly good coffee...fast,"This thing really jams. We recently received this as a gift and I could not be happier. I start my day off with a double cappucino but, some days, I just don't have the patience to go through the whole routine. While this doesn't make espresso, it does make a mighty fine cup (or two) of coffee. I was really amazed at how good the coffee that this French Press makes. If you are in the market for one, I would definitely get the 8 cup model as you can make a smaller amount if you would like or the full 8 cups.The process could not be easier. Put in your desired amount of coffee, pour in the corresponding amount of boiling water, let it steep for 4 minutes, press, close, pour. The only thing I am still trying to figure out is how to best get the grounds out without pouring them down the sink. This is really an inexpensive treat for those who enjoy coffee and it won't take up a lot of room in the kitchen."
2,"Good coffee, but too breakable!","I got this for my husband in 2009 and it produces easy-brew, good tasting coffee. Unfortunately, I have purchased 3 replacement carafes since them, 1 each year. Although the description says that the glass has been specially treated to deter breakage, this carafe simply blasts apart if something hits it the right way (in the sink, for example). And I am not saying that anything was dropped on the carafe---it has broken all 3 times when another glass or bowl ""tapped"" into the side. Yeah, I agree that this could be avoided if you handled the thing with kid gloves, hand-washing it immediately and never letting it come near anything else in the kitchen---but come on!They do offer a plastic version but I prefer glass as do many who are trying to avoid plastic altogether. NOTE: I bought a similar glass French Press from IKEA for around $12, and that carafe has never been an issue!"
4,best way to drink coffee,French press coffee is the most flavorful. Use a coarse coffee grind. This pot makes about 3 mugs worth of coffee. I wrap a tea towel around it as an insulator while it's steeping. Price is decent esp w/free shipping. You won't find it online for less. and I couldn't locate it elsewhere at any bricks-and-mortar stores for less.
4,Ben,"I came to know the notion of French Press at a friend's place. I ordered one of this pot immediately from amazon. The pot works great and the coffee just tastes a lot better compared to what's out of my dripping coffee maker. There is a good article for new adopters on how to operate the pot: http://www.coffeegeek.com/guides/presspot. One needs to pay attention to a couple of things, though:1. The pot is a good design but be very careful with the glass when you clean it. (In case you break it, there's a replacement glass sold here at amazon.)2. Use corse ground. Get a good grinder which can make real corse ground instead of boulder and dust.3. Stur with wooden or plastic stuff, e.g. a chopstick.btw, my first order was a DOA but amazon was very fast to ship me a replacement. Thanks for the good service."
2,"love the coffee, but too fragile","I've owned one of these for a number of years and have always been pleased. However, I recently, broke my original beaker. Completely my fault. I replaced that beaker immediately with a true bodum chamord replacement beaker, and it was broken within a month. This one, however, was not my fault. I boiled, brewed and plunged as always, and when I went to pour I noticed that the beaker had cracked around the spout. It appeared to be a heat fracture. Again, I replaced the beaker and again it didn't last a month. The third one broke in exactly the same area as the second, apparently from tapping the plastic grinder receptacle on the glass when putting the grounds into the beaker.Unfortunately, I think that the beakers just aren't being made as well as they were when i purchased originally, and for that reason I won't be buying another replacement. My Frieling Stainless model is on its way."
4,A great cup of Coffee,I have used a Bodum coffee press for about 10 years. I recently bought the 32 oz because I wanted a bigger pot. This has always made excellent coffee. Cleanup is easy and the filters seem to last forever. The only thing I like less about the larger pot is the dome lid which I find cumbersome and difficult to pour from. I use 6 scoops of coffee grounds in the 32oz pot and it makes great coffee. I read the review on having to use a separate pot to heat water! Well it's not a big deal and it's worth the difference in taste.
5,Quality Product,"This is a simple, inexpensive, but well-made product that works well. We use the Bodum for after dinner coffee and use an ordinary Braun coffee maker for the rest of the day. The 8-cup version really just makes about enough coffee for the two of us."
3,"Good coffee, but fragile maker","If you like French press coffee, this is the best way to go. Unfortunately, every couple of years or so, you have to get a replacement. Maybe we are just clumsy, but glass breaks easily, coiled wires pop out on the plunger. Stuff comes apart. Just expect it as cost of having Euro-style coffee."
2,Paint peels off and glass is brittle,"The filter assembly works well and this press makes good coffee. I have used this product twice a week for the past year. About six months ago, the paint began peeling off the holder of the carafe. Nothing dangerous, but it's unattractive and evinces poor quality. This morning, I noticed a crack along the top of the carafe. I have never dropped it and have always carefully hand-washed it after every use. There is no reason for there to be a crack in the carafe outside of the glass being too fragile for normal use.If you intend to use this daily, expect to replace it every few months."
5,French Press Coffee Maker,"Excellent quality, wouldn't recommend any other kind. I have been using it for a long time, and consider it the best you can find."
4,French Press is the best,"Great redo of the classic.Makes great coffee. Need to have a good grinder and top coffee to really get the best out of it. Always use softened filtered water. I originally bought the version that came with the nifty 4 minute timer. This one didn't and though it was cheaper, I think it is a better value to buy the one that comes with the timer if you need that."
2,Excellent Coffee-Cheaply Made Coffee Maker,"The good news is that this coffee press makes an excellent cup of coffee if you use a coarse grind of quality coffet to begin with. The bad news is that the coffee gets cold quickly, so you better be ready to gulp it down or transfer it to an insulated pot. This presents the problem of the coffee cooling as you transfer it from the Bodum press to another container. The coffee press is made in China with all that this indicates. The materials, workmanship and parts are not top quality for a product that is not inexpensive. The glass is typical low strength Chinese glass and is prone to break easily. This product is a prime example of why many American manufacturers are returning to the USA to make their products. Chinese goods are what they are and they are not top quality!"
3,OK but lacks measurement lines,I got just what I wanted only this Frence press lacked the measurement lines found on others in their line.
3,Delicate,"A few days after my purchase, the carafe broke. I believe it is too delicate. Maybe its just me though!"
1,Great but broke,It is a good product but it broke within 2 weeks of steady use. The glass is to thin maybe and it costs just as much to buy new glass as the whole product. Does anyone know if it can be returned because of this?
4,good quality,"screen can get a little bunched up, but overall it works well and makes a nice cup of coffee. Definitely gives you the flexibility to make coffee exactly how you want it"
5,"Great press, perfect size","I purchased this press to replace myBodum New Kenya 12-Ounce Coffee Press, Blackwhich I thought was too small. I was very happy with my smaller press so it was a no brainer to go with another Bodum product. I prefer my coffee made in a press but even better I LOVE not having a huge coffee maker sitting on my counter.If you're considering a press, I highly recommend this one. The price is right, the size is perfect. You can easily adjust how much coffee you make by how much water/grounds you use so you don't need to worry about always having too much coffee. However, when the need arises you have a bigger pot to make more coffee for those mornings when you need the extra jolt or when company comes.Yummy, yummy....now I want some coffee."
4,great coffee,"I stumbled across this coffee maker on amazon. I have had several coffee makers including an espresso machine, table top espresso and a regular brewer. This one makes coffee better than a reg brewer. I do prefer coffee from an espresso maker, just because it is stronger. But this does make excellent coffee."
5,Very well Packaged.,Gave this as a gift. The french press came very well packaged. It took about 2 minutes to open as a gift for christmas.
4,Coffee Press,This is a standard good quality coffee press. The website was a bit confusing and I ordered a smaller one than I intended.
5,French Press review,"We ordered and recieved a Bodum Chamboard Coffee Press.The unit is well designed, and functions well. It is very easy to clean, after use."
4,Nice!,"The first one I ordered came broken in pieces. Amazon nicely sent out a new one. Once I got the final product, it is quality and large. Very happy."
5,Wonderful coffee!,"We gave this Coffee Press to our daughter and son-in-law as a housewarming present for their new mountain house, along with a coffee grinder. They were so thrilled and think it is the best coffee ever! They just love it."
5,you cannot go wrong!,"I recently received this as a gift. I had asked for one after deciding I spent too much money at a certain chain coffee house. My drip machine made coffee that tasted horrible, so I found myself buying more and more of my coffee instead of making it at home.I tried the Bodum Chambord French Press for the first time tonight and I don't think I will be headed back to that chain coffee house for awhile! The coffee really does taste amazing and it is so easy to use. The fact that everything is dishwasher safe is an added bonus.As another reviewer posted, I had always thought french press devotees used them for the snob factor. Now I know it is because they make the best coffee!"
1,Broke after 1 month,"I bought this for my husband, and initially, he was very pleased with it. It strains the grounds very well, and makes a smooth coffee. After 4 weeks, it developed a hairline crack that eventually spread. Once it did, the whole glass beaker disintegrated. My husband washed it by hand once a day very carefully, and he never dropped it. We were very disappointed with this product."
3,"Not great, not terrible. A little disjointed.","What prevented me from liking this book more than I did was that it felt disjointed. The main character moves from one strange abusive home, into another equally strange setting, where the abuse continues. Then she is taken away from there and it gets a little surreal, until she is found and brought back to civilization. Then from there she gradually works through the emotional and physical abuse she suffered. The story just didn't feel very real or probable to me. The writing was good, the storyline is what I didn't like."
1,Nothing like I expected,I found this book a big dissappointment. It was really disgusting. It had very morbid thoughts in it. I could never understand why Jael talked to statues. I thought this book would be so much better.
4,A very unique story,"This is the 4th Sherri Reynolds book I've read and they're all great. There's something about her unique style of story telling that keeps bringing me back. Once again, she has not disappointed."
2,bad story line,"A predictable story line and ""magical"" solutions made for a not entertaining read. I had a hard time liking Jael. This is a serious topic, and I wish the resolution had been more realistic than simply talking to a statue."
3,Could have been better,"The authors writing is beautiful however i felt she spent way too much time ""penning pretty prose"" instead of telling a believable story. I admit that I enjoy a simpler book if you will. For the most part I couldn't follow what was happening because Reynolds was so busy trying to be poetic that she failed to develope interesting characters and a decent story."
5,Not For Everyone,"Before you get this book, keep in mind that this was written by an extremely smart individual for other smart individuals. If you want to build a program for your athlete(s) or for yourself but don't know where to start, you should get Periodization Training For Sports. That is still written by Dr. Bompa but is translated by a writer, so it's much easier to read and understand. If you know how to build a program, and want to know the science behind it, then this is for you. I have spoken to many bright individuals in the field of Exercise and Sports Performance who were overwhelmed by this book. It has priceless information, but just realize who the target audience is before you purchase this book."
5,It works,"15 years ago I was a high performance kayaker. I did not understand all those complicated workouts then ... Recently (3 years ago) I started kayaking seriously again and won age group competitions at all levels accross North America.Periodization is what produces results. It is based on science which combined with expertise and experience will yield results. I have been watching the development teams and now involved in workout design. This book provides a clear description of the general issues and lets you peek into the specifics. Of course, you cannot just coach by reading a book. But if you are a coach or an athlete with serious experince, this book is going to make a lot of sense to you."
3,Sports better than Theory,For practical use I would recommend Periodization Training for SportsI got this book before Theory and Methodology of Training. And found that the theory did not bring to much new info
5,Entrancing,"Here is a song that will draw you in and never let you leave. As I said on another review, I listened to the Defeat single for 3 days straight. The lyrics, the notes, the background - every bit of it works together. One of Cosmicity's best!"
5,Youth Groups and Hume Lake Christian Camps.,"This is the best devotional book I've seen. It made everything so much easier to understand. The explainations are taken from everyday life. When I first got it, I couldn't put it down, I had to keep reading. It is amazing and I recommend it to all Christian teens.It really isn't a ""Scary Devotional."" But, I just don't understand the cover."
5,This book rocks,"As a young feminist, I had an exceptionally difficult time reconciling my beliefs with the fact not only was I head over heels in love with a man, for some reason I was even thinking I wanted to marry him. I had spent most of my life to date deriding the institution of marriage, and when I realized that commitment was in fact what I wanted with this man, I felt utterly confused. I wish I'd had this book three years ago when I was looking for some guidance -- even reading it now gave me a fresh dose of insight and made me realize that there are OTHERS out there as well who struggle with this decision.In short: this book rocks. No matter what your situation and persuasion, you'll find something inside you can relate with."
2,There was something missing,"This book is first and foremost a collection of stories about feminism, and secondly about marriage. I think if I had understood that from the start I would be less disappointed in this book.I felt that most of the authors were somehow hiding behind very complicated ideological structures and it was hard to find vulnerability, personal honesty and insight, or even a sense of understanding in many of the stories. While I found many of the topics in the book fascinating, the essays themselves just fell completely flat."
2,um..what?,Ok...Pros:Its clamp.Beautiful art.Its clamp.Cons:What??? What just happened?No plot.No character development.What??While I enjoyed the gorgreous drawings... the manga should be renamed miyukichan in rapeland. Took me less than 40 minutes to read the whole thing. Aside from the fact that's its clamp and I'm a collctor.. there's really no reason for purchasing this manga. Its.. pointless. Literally. No point.
1,"Clamp is not perfect all the time, but most of the time.","I love Clamp but I hate this. X, Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, and Wish are some of my all time favorite titles, but... Love them as I do I admit this. I hate Miyuki, the anime and the manga.Blah.No offense Clamp sorry to offend, just my opinion."
5,Bulgaria,"Bulgaria:Enchantment of the World which written by Abraham Resnick. This book published by Childrens Pess,Inc.in 1995 that has colorful book,123 pages pictures and maps of Bulgaria. The book tell the the geography,history,people,economic,and customs of this Balkan country.It is easy to read and very informative,interesting and appealing for kids and adluts because this book has seperated each section of Bulgaria,and more information each section and then,the book has a hard cover, and at the back of book has title of other counties such as Nigeria,Poland, England,etc.. The book has something that is weakness. The book should update because the book wrote around 10 years ago. I think the book that is wonderful book for reader. I impress and get knowledge a lot of information in this book. So, I give five stars for Bulgaria book."
4,Frigidaire icemaker,"We had the ice maker installed by a contractor who was doing other work for us. He had no trouble with the installation. It took several hours before the ice maker started to drop ice but it has been working fine so far. We are satisfied. Price was excellent, but we could not have done it ourselves... no tools and advanced age!"
3,Ice maker,Great vendor! Fast shipment. We purchased this to replace and existing icemaker. This was cheaper than repairing the same model ice maker. The only problem with the icemaker is it very slow to make ice compared to the old one. It makes it very irritating to run out of ice.
5,"Works well, easy to install",The install was easy except that it didn't come with the two self tapping screws that were necessary. Overall it produces ice as I'd expect
4,No more ice trays!,"We have never had an ice maker in the house and this fit the bill. It was incredibly simple to hookup, and the directions were very clear and concise.The only reason I took a star off is because of the water valve. First, one of the hose hookups is a weird teeth clamp thing I haven't dealt with and I am worried it might leak in the future. Second, the thing is loud. When it is pulling water you can hear it. This puppy is loud and makes a clacking sound. My parents ice maker at their home is the same model and isn't near as noticeably. Luckily it only does it for a couple of second every hour or so.I'm sure I will tune the noise out and not notice it in the future. Totally worth it to get rid of the ice trays!"
3,Parts,"The Ice Maker was received in a timely manner. Upon installing the ice maker, it was discovered that the water was leaking around the valve. We then proceed to purchase a new valve, rather than returning the product. Unfortunately, the part for the ice maker was expensive, leaving me with the notion that I might as well purcahse locally rather than going to the trouble of returning the product and/or seeking a new part for the item purchased."
2,Broken after 2 months,"EDIT: 2 Months after installation it stopped making ice. Not too sure if it is the ice maker itself is broken or the valve that controls water flow.Shipping was fast and vender processed order next day. For the ice maker itself, it was very easy to install on my Frigidaire refrigerator. However the back of the fridge was missing some of the clearance holes to mount the valve on the back of the fridge so you might have to drill a couple holes. Other than that no problem.Makes ice just fine (you'll want to run the water line out for a good 10-15 minutes before hooking up to the back of the fridge or your ice will taste weird for a few batches. Not too sure how fast a batch is supposed to be made but it seems like it does about 2-3 batches of ice per day which is a bit on the slow side compared to other ice makers I have used (the only reason for taking a star away)."
5,An uncommonly perceptive critique,"Jay Prosser's book (in addition to being uniquely insightful) occupies a unique place in the growing (trans)gender studies canon: it is the only one that engages seriously with the specificity of transsexual (as distinct from transgender) identification, and critically examines the points of critical divergence between the two (or the several, if you prefer). His readings of the Well of Loneliness and Stone Butch Blues, as well as the appended consideration of transsexual photographic self-portrait (which is as moving as it is insightful) are, quite simply, not to be missed. A must."
1,This was...,"I had to read this book for a class at University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin, and I will never, ever recommend this... to anyone. Is he really trying to reach people? Or just other PhD peoples? Gimme a break."
4,Nicely designed!,"This body glove is extremely well designed, I have gone through several different holders for this phone, and every one of them has failed, due to the difficulty to designing a holder for the odd design of this phone. This one has yet to fail on me, and it dosn't seem to be giving any indication of doing so."
3,ok,"these are good but the problem is they need to sell them with the batteries out side the unit just like a cellphone package these are grate but your highly likely to have to buy a bran new battery after you receive it the batteries drain while they idle on shelf in warehouses, I try to get Amazon to reimburse me the battery cost but no response cos its to bad don't have much of a choice unless you want to get a gas power generator which is impossible if you own/rent condo/apartment or a bedroom. . 99% is the problem is only the battery is died. etherise this would be a 100% 5 start rating, but i after i bought the new battery i liked it!!!!"
1,Another short life span product from Celestron,"I've used one along with a couple of my astronomy buddies and all I can say is, this is another cheap, short life span product from Celestron ( or should I say a chinese owned company using an well known US product name? )...God for bid if you bump this unit around or forget to recharge it IMMEDIATELY after a night of usage, it's not going to hold up let alone last...don't get dupped with all the gizmos and lights or any amatuer review from those who haven't used great equipment...as an advanced astronomer invest your money on a product that holds up and will last you night in and night out!"
1,Two Thumbs Down,"Bought the 7AH version a couple of years ago. The floodlight never worked due to a broken switch, but I didn't bother to ship it back since I only wanted the battery to power my mount. (First thumb down if you actually want a working flood.) I probably got 20-30 observing sessions out of it with no apparent problem. It will certainly run the drive for several hours if you don't also have your CCD or dew heater plugged in.Unfortunately, it's been in the closet for over a year and will no longer charge. Could be the typical problem of a cheap battery not being cycled for an extended period of time. Or could be the fact that the charging unit is putting out 2.5A at 22V when it's rated for 500ma/15V. Lol... (Second thumb down.)"
3,Acceptable for the Price (3.5 Stars),"So lets get right to it then:The Pro's:1) Comes with everything advertised.2) Sturdy construction, feels like it could take a couple of good falls.3) LED lamp saves energy for the important stuff.4) Not to heavy or cumbersome to use.5) Acceptable power and battery life.The Con's1) LED lamp does save energy but lacks in illumination. Whats more important to you in this trade off?2) Red plastic cover for secondary light is cheaply made. Came with a crack in it and broke completely when placing it onsecondary light source.3) Charging adapters fit loosely into designated areas; have to wiggle to get a good connection. (Similar issues are wellknown with celestron scopes, why they do not address this is beyond me?)4) Pretty sure I got a returned Power Tank: The celestron box was open - items inside were placed incorrectly - Battery had afull charge on it out of the box. Was going to return it but it seems to be working properly.See you soon, SOUND"
1,My power switch came installed reversed,"I guess I have to concur with the commenter that said it was cheap factory assembly. My power switch was actually installed backwards, so ON was CHARGE and vice-versa. They asked if I wanted another one when I called Celestron (...). So now I'm waiting probably 2 weeks for them to ship me another one and I have a star party tomorrow. I guess I will also have to concur with the commenter that said not to rely on it, but in this case don't rely on it being correctly assembled the first time."
2,Good tank - charger stinks,"I have gone thru 3 power adapters used to charge this power tank.Celestron has hinted that they have a problem with the chargers, but now that it is out of warrenty, they won't respond to my emails about replacing the charger.Good luck if you get the charger to last more than a month....."
4,Celestron Power Tank,Celestron Power TankThe power tank is an excellent source of energy for my Celestron SE 8 telescope. It eliminates wasting batteries and provides the right amount of power to energize the scope. It's great not having buy batteries and it's also wonderful to not have a power adapter cord getting in the way. The only drawback is the weight of the power tank since I carry my scope to my outside deck. This is a very worthwhile accessory for Celestron SE telescope owners. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Not bad at all,"Probably your best bet if you want to go the less expensive route for a field power pack. I wish it was rated to start a dead car battery, rather than assist ignition; but otherwise, a great buy for me."
2,Celestron fails again,"The item arrived loosely packed, one of the adapters was bent and power chord was missing. It's almost like this item was used by someone else, returned and then resold. who knows.The instructions did not even mention how to use it with the Celestron telescope that part you have to figure out on your own. I've bought the NexStar 8, the set of extra filters and lenses and this power pack. I don't know why but Celstron documentation on all three products is erroneous or just lacking. The telescope info was inaccurate and had outdated info from an older manual and the filters and tank had minimal info. It's almost like they were too cheap to spend the money on hiring someone to create useful documentation.They are very slow to respond to repsond to phone or email requests for support. Do yourself a favor and do not buy Celestron products there are plenty of other qualified makers of this type of product."
1,Unnecessary gimmick,"If you want to power your telescope there are less expensive ways. Of course this is a most elegant but also a most costly solution. Experience shows that the unit is failure prone in many ways.Rather buy a 12V battery of sufficient capacity, i.e. about 10 Ah. This will make it easily through a night of observing."
2,Missing cable?,"I got a telescope and several accessories including the celestron power tank (my telescope is a celestron). There is no way to connect the power tank to the telescope. The slot for the power into the telescope requires a special connector that looks like a phone jack. The power tank has a 4"" cable with that connector, but the other end does not connect to any part of the power tank. There is no way to bridge the connection.I had to go to radio shack to buy the parts to make my own cable to connect the power tank to the telescope."
4,Decent power for field use,"This battery unit has been usefull to me in the field as long as I don't use a dew zapper for too long (more that 4 hours).I live in Montreal where it gets pretty cold in the winter (typical viewing session this winter was below zero F.) Using a dew zapper to keep the corrector lens of my Mak clear of frost will drain the unit in about 4 hoursIf I use a dew shield and only use the zapper occasionally, I can use it all night but some nights, the humidity gets so high that the dew zapper needs to be on almost continuously, and this is where it is slightly underpowered for a full night of use. And since my telescope drive is also connected to it, I've had to shut down on some nights prematurely.All in all, a pretty good unit"
5,Fantastic Power Tank,"The Celestron Power Tank is very useful. I bought it to power my Celestron Nexstar 8 SE telescope, since 8 ""AA"" batteries do not last very long in it. With the Power Tank I can use my scope all night. It also came in handy when Hurricane Humberto knocked our power out. I used the Power Tank to power my portable TV so I could watch the storm coverage on the local news. I used the built-in flash lights during the storm, too. The Celestron Power Tank is a great product!"
5,"Excellent Product... if you have an electronic scope, must have one.","Have been using mine for over six months now and it`s awesome... I primarily use it for my NextStar6SE and I can say that one charge goes three consecutive nights... yes, three full, 8 hour nights of observation. I haven`t noticed any decrease in performance so far. I use it 2-4 times a month and charge it about the same amount of times. Charging is fast, takes no more than 5 hours. I also use mine to inflate air matresses while camping and it seems like this affects the charge a lot more than the actual telescope use."
5,This is a gift,Our son in law requested this for Christmas. We have not used it but it looks just as advertised. Hopefully it will be exactly what he wanted. Thank you for the timely shipment
5,*Just Wonderful!*,"I bought this single video especially to see how Helen structured the copper pot. Even though I had watched some of Helen's teaching videos, I had somehow forgotten what a wonderful teacher she was. I have played it several times, and always seem to get more depth of what she conveys. This tape inspired me to buy some of her series, and it started with this video. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see how a painting such as this is done from start to finish. One of the things I love about Helen's instruction is that she doesn't just demonstrate what she is painting, but tells you WHY she did it that way."
2,"Not very good, even at the price","Bought these as a housewarming gift. Fortunately, tested them before making the present.Disappointing optical quality and build/finish. I'd hoped that such a reputable company would use at least second-rate optics, perhaps in a cheap case. But these have few if any redeeming qualities. Optical quality is so low (even at center) that real improvement over naked-eye is marginal. I was unable to achieve good image alignment with any combination of ocular separation and diopter adjustment.I returned these and bought the Nikon Monarch 10.5x45 binocs, a bit over twice the price (with current Amazon sale and company rebate) and at least ten times the value. Still nowhere near as good as my Nikon 8x32 LX, much less the real top-end gear, but a whole lot cheaper and good enough for most uses.At this price point (or even cheaper), I'd recommend getting a lower-power compact or mid-size with better performance. Might just be a QC issue, but I didn't want to try another pair."
2,Much ado about nothing,"I have been required to use this text at one school where I teach, and it is a dismal experience. Most of the other instructors feel the same way, but we are overruled by a minority opinion.The authors do not have a clue that they are writing this book for a freshman college audience. You need advanced reading skills in order to be able to understand some of the chapters in this book. For example, they overly complicate the chapter on writing evaluations.The readings are also dry and have a noticeably liberal slant. Although, there are a couple of interesting ones, such as the essay about Sesame Street being sexist. However, there are not enough readings to provide good examples for students to use as models.If I was not forced to use the book, I would not. This is too much money to spend on a book that is not especially useful."
3,Effective,Really takes you through each essay and asks you various questions about it. It's covering pretty much everything about writing. I recommend it.
5,"Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing, Brief Edition, The (4th Edition)",The book contains good up to date information and it has helped me with my College writing class.
4,Good Product,"The book was in very good condition, but it took longer than the time it said it would take for expedited shipping. So it was a little slow, but otherwise it was great service."
4,Solar Panel,The unit is more or less what I expected and appears to be working well for my application as a trickle charger for my deep-cycle marine battery operating an ornamental iorn entry gate. This unit DOES NOT work with the Sunsei Solar Grip bracket which is listed as working with the Coleman Solar Panels (both are ICP Solar products); the bracket extexsions are not long enough. I was able to frabricate a simple clamp for the panel which did work with the bracket however.
3,"Works well, when it works!!","I use this with my astronomical observatory to recharge a 35 amp-hour lead-acid battery. When in use, the battery is used to power my telescope and some other low-draw electronics. The battery is drained at night (when skies are clear) and this thing (in conjunction with the Coleman CC-4000 charge controller) recharges it during the day.My panel is permanently mounted for this purpose. I do not attempt to cover it, nor have I done anything to protect it from the elements. It has worked well for over a year, despite snow, ice, rain, and high winds.This panel has also DECREASED IN PRICE since I bought mine. I would buy it again.FOLLOW-UP AFTER TWO YEARS: This product died almost to the day that its warranty expired. This could be just my bad luck or it could be that the item is not build to last. Draw your own conclusions."
3,Solar Panel For Boat Battery,"I am still testing the merits of this purchase. I Bought it to keep my boat battery charged , since I use the boat infrequently. I may have needed to buy a larger panel to get more charging power...Still in the tryout stage.JRB"
4,The size fooled me,"This device makes a great cup of coffee, but that's exactly what it makes; a cup, meaning one 12 oz mug of coffee.I thought it would make three cups and had to buy a larger size. Otherwise it works fine and the coffee is goood."
4,"Great design, great function, great quality.","It does what you want it to do - maybe a bit small for some, i would definatley recomend getting a bigger size, unless you like small cups of coffe.The only other thing i would comment is the glass is VERY VERY fragile, it would be nice if they could replace it with tempered glass, or maybe even a high quality polythene...its breaks VERY easily."
5,Excellent taste for coffee-for-one,"Although it's a 3-cup, it's really a large cup for one person. The taste and aroma are wonderful and it's easy to clean up. I bought this because it doesn't use paper filters and heard the taste is better than automatic drip. It's true!"
2,Broken on delivery,"One of four arrived broken. The reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 star is that so far the other three appear OK, but I wonder if the material will stand the test of time (or hot water)."
2,Arrived Shattered,"More a review of the packaging/handling than the item itself.The glass carafe was shattered when the package arrived. There was not much internal packaging in the Bodum box which kind of surprised me given how delicate you'd think glass would be treated.My other French Press is the stainless steel model, 12 c I think, from Bodum which I highly recommend. That thing is indestructible!I am returning this glass model to try a different brand's steel travel mug french press."
2,"very, very, small","I sent for the 1923-16 Cambord 3 cup coffee press. Trust me, this pot will only hold a cup of coffee. It is of no use to me . I reordered and they sent me another tinycoffee press. Now I have to send two pots back.. I am hoping for a refund, I would ask for one if I knew where to check. The pot works fine."
3,Bodum 3-cup coffee press,"I purchased the 3-cup Bodum Coffee Press recently, I does make good coffee, no grounds, but I was very disappointed in the size - I expected a full 3 cup size, not a thimble size, rather false advertising,"
2,Nice - but NOT 3 Cups - it's 1 Cup,"Nice unit but it holds 10 oz max, not 24 which is 3 cups. If you want a large cup of coffee - just one - you'll have to load this thing twice. It fits 8 oz comfortably, no more.A real drag as they say 3 cups!"
1,Glass carafe was broken in shipping,The glass carafe was broken during shipping. The shattered glass sifted all over my kitchen floor when I opened the package. I will not order this product again.
2,More hype than functionality,"I did not find french press made coffee to be any better than a coffee made from a drip coffee maker. Even with coarse grinding, I found ground coffee at the bottom."
3,VERY small coffee press,"The ""3-cup"" part of the name is very misleading -- this is a wee little coffee press, good for no more than 1.5 average cups of coffee. Sadly mine arrived shattered, and Amazon messed up my refund which I am trying to resolve. Disappointing purchase."
4,Tea Presser?,"I bought the Bodum Coffee Press for my father for Christmas. He's a tea fanatic and I heard that it was good for brewing loose tea as well as coffee. My father loves it as much as he loves his old tea pots. The only problem i see is that the coffee press doesn't maintain heat as well as his ceramic tea pot...but this product wasn't meant to do that so its not a fault of the product.**on a side note, i tried using the coffee press with actual coffee grinds. It was good and my coffee tasted wonderful and really full body. But when it came to clean up, at the edges where the metal presser and the metal filter meet, coffee grinds tend to get stuck in there. I don't know if its b/c my coffee grinder grinds the beans to fine or if its just the product itself, but i can't seem to get all the grinds out ever."
5,Love Love Love,"I absolutely love this french press. This is a perfect size to make one cup of coffee and a pretty tasty one.When doing my initial research for a french press, I googled to find out the best brands and types. The Bodum brand definitely tops the list for a quality french press.In addition, the cleaning for this coffee press is very quick and easy. After pouring my cup of coffee into my mug, I just quickly rinse off the press.This is seriously one of the best investments I have made and I more than recommend it to any coffee lover. In the case that you want to make more than a cup of coffee, I recommend getting a size bigger but this size is defintely perfect for one!"
3,bodum1923-16 chamboard,"It is NOT three cupsBodum 1923-16 Chambord 3-Cup Coffee PressIt is ONE cup, 8 oz's, which is not enough for even one person, With the labor factored in, it is too much trouble. Maybe for espresso,but they suggest very hot water, and of course not that much pressure.I would love it if was THREE cups for coffee, or tea."
4,A little short on volume.,"I only know one person in the world that drinks 6oz of coffee a day, and he's about five-six and a hundred pounds. If you are looking to have a cup and a half or coffee for two, go bigger. 3 cups means 3x4oz = 12 oz, minus the 3 or so oz that you don't pour into your cup (to avoid bitter, teeth staining tannins) means that you get about 9ox of coffee. Unless, that is what you want."
4,single cup of perfect coffee,"... and that's exactly what you'll get. A French press is arguably the best cup of coffee around, and that's what you'll get. It will just be very small. I bought it after not looking closely enough at the description -- I wanted a 12 CUP press, so this just wasn't the one to replace the drip coffee maker we use every morning here. We debated sending it back, and finally decided against it.So I brought it to work, and it's perfect there. It fits into a small corner, and makes only as much coffee as I can take away with me, leaving very little mess behind. It comes with its own scoop, which is convenient, though I like rather a bit more grounds than they suggest. Eh. It's still a lovely cup that comes out well enough that I don't need to put cream into it.And yes, it does make a fine cup of tea as well."
4,Great quality cofee/ tea press,"I've bought two of these. Good, solid construction of glass and metal.I was at first concerned about pouring hot water into a cold glass recipient knowing how glass can crack but it was a non issue. I could not find this small size ( 12-ounce) at local stores so I had to buy online."
5,Quite stylish and functional,"I have to admit that I knew how big this press was, so I was not surprised to see that a 3-cup is equivalent to a mugful for me. It's easy to clean and maintain but this isn't for the rough-handler. It can break and bend if treated without care. I love it and I use it everyday."
4,"Great coffee.......however, don't wash by hand!!","We discovered the joys of the French Press in Europe, and rushed home to order one........the coffee is just as we expected......using the coarse grind and the coffee is OUT of this world......I usually used the dishwasher to clean it, but one day I was in a rush and while washing it by hand, cracked the glass carafe.........oooooo........now disappointed since we'd have to wait to have our wonderful morning coffee till we ordered another carafe. In fact, I ordered two. I am now wondering if I should have ordered the unbreakable one."
3,Too many grounds left in the coffee,"Makes tasty coffee, but far too many grounds get into the cup to make it worth the special preparation. I usually let the brew sit to let grounds settle, but the coffee still pours into the cup looking cloudy. Yes, I used coarse grounds as suggested.Also, this is really only a one cup coffee maker - unless you are using demi-tasse cups.Cleanup is a little more work since grounds aren't caught in a filter. I use a spatula to get the majority of grounds out of the press."
2,lasted less than 3 months,"The size is really 250ml, 1 mug size. It worked well for over 2 months then the filter got caught by the wall of glass ja, it flipped downwards. I called BODUM, asked about warranty - nothing is under warranty! The web site only says the glass is not under warranty, did not mention anything else. I was also told by customer service that many customers called and he spoke with his supervisor, the answer is NO WANRRANTY on any part!I called Amazon and got a replacement. Thanks Amzon. But I do not feel good. It is BODUM should do the replacement, not Amazon."
5,Why I started drinking coffee,"This french press creates high quality, great tasting brew. The press is small, easy to use, and easy to clean. It makes one cup at a time. Takes 4 minutes for the coffee to steep. You need a device to heat up the water, like a kettle with an auto shutoff feature when the water boils.I bought this for my wife as a gift. She said the quality and taste of coffee using this french press is far superior to the coffee maker we had before that cost us nearly $100. I finally gave in and tried the coffee, thinking that I would respond as I typically do that the taste is awful. Bear in mind that my last sip of coffee was at least 10 years ago. Since the fateful sip two months ago, I've been drinking coffee 3-4 times a week, one cup each time. I'm probably going to buy another french press so both my wife and I will have a hers and his. Fortunately, our kids are too young to even want to taste it."
3,Pot isnt large enough!,"We bought one of these expecting more than the one cup of water it holds. 8 oz equals one cup. But even if the box states (which our box didn't) that it is measured for 4-oz cups, this pot should hold at least 12 oz and it simply doesn't. It holds 8 oz total.We like the product, but we have to brew twice for the two of us. We bought it for travel and have the large one at home."
2,Not a good design,I bought this product and used it four times before the carafe broke. Not very well designed; the carafe fits too tightly into the holder making it very difficult to remove. I was always concerned that the glass would break in my hand. Fortunately it cracked instead of completely breaking. It's also very small. You can barely get the average morning cup of coffee out of it. I wouldn't recommend.
4,French Press Coffee -- Why take the time.,"For ideal coffee using a French press is the best method. It takes a bit more time and effort, but results in much better tasting coffee. This is because due to the lower temperatures and the lack of a paper filter the coffee oils stay in tact. This adds a lot of flavor to the coffee that is lost otherwise.As for this French press in particular: size does matter. If you make enough coffee that you aren't drinking by the single mug then just get a bigger press. I drink about a pot and half of coffee most week days and find the effort required to use this smaller press a hassle. As such I just keep this press at home and only use it in the evenings."
1,Let's grounds slip by the screen,Terrible press. The filter screen doesn't fit the container properly so it lets grounds slip by. I am referring to very coarse grind grounds as well. This press is totally useless.I returned the press after two attempted uses.
3,Too small,"Suggest that one read the description carefully. This is a very good product but it holds only 12 ounces. Thus, if one expects to brew three cups, these are three small cups. One normally expects a cup to hold six to eight ounces. These cups are only four ounces."
3,Broken,I guess I am too Clumsey but I went through two broken glass parts when I bought the stainless steel one and that is the best.
1,Doesn't filter coffee grounds! AT ALL!,When you press the coffee down the sides of the insert do not even touch the coffee press. It is impossible for the device to work. I returned it and receive a quick full refund.
2,Mini Mini Mini,"I guess I should have done the math. This press is cute. But it comes nowhere close to 3 small cups of coffee, not even two. The coffee tasted great, but the whole thing is more bother than it is worth."
2,To small,"This is way to small to make even one mug of coffee, I should have sent it back but we used it."
1,Not a press,"This coffee press doesn't press the coffee. It just isn't designed correctly and not worth the trouble. My old Mr. Coffee makes better coffee. And yes, I have had wonderful coffee made with a coffee press that worked, so I do know the difference. I will keep looking for a good coffee press"
2,Bodum 3 cup French Press,"I love it. It makes delicious coffee. Besides, I feel so Continental! Always liked seeing the Brits use this on sitcoms out of the BBC."
2,3-cups does not equal 3 cups (24oz),"It's important when ordering to note that ""3 cups"" = 12 ounces = 3 tea cup sized cups. What a disappointment to receive this tiny French press since I failed to notice the fine print when ordering. See the image I uploaded. Realistically you couldn't get 3 cups out of this once you allow for the space grounds take and space at the top to avoid overflow."
1,meaning of a cup,I understand that my Idea of a cup and a real cup are not the same thing when it comes to a good cup of coffee. this claims to be a 3 cup pot.When in reality it holds 1-1/4 measuring cups of water. insufficient amount of water.
3,"I didn't get to use the product, because when it arrived broken.","I was told the Bodum is a premium brand for manufacturing coffee presses. I placed an order for a 3-cup french press as a gift for two friends. They are a married couple and tired of drinking commercial instant coffee. The photo presented on Amazon looked like a 3-cup one is big enough for two people to use at the same time. Thus I recommended and bought a 3-cup coffee press for them.However, after the deliver guy left, I opened the package box to find the glass of the press already broken. And the size looks kind of small for two people, especially when I am going to give it as a gift. So I returned the 3-cup press and ordered a 4-cup one from Amazon. The money was returned to my account promptly. I was impressed by how convenient and efficient to return a product on Amazon. My friends like the 4-cup french press very much and are using it frequently."
4,"Makes great coffee, but it's small","The press makes great tasting coffee, but this size is small and hardly enough for one person. It makes about a mug full."
5,"Easy, Chick-Magnet, Makes you a BAMF","Great product, almost impossible to screw up the process of making coffee with this. Plus, it's the most flavorful way to brew. I guess the fact that the ladies love me >1000x more, now that I own one, is an additional benefit."
3,Bodum Chambord 12-Ounce Coffee Press,"This press is a great pot and does the job just fine. I wish I had gotten the next larger size because I usually would like a second cup almost immediately. Otherwise, it's great!"
4,Good Product with a couple fo cavaets,"We have used this coffee press for maybe 3 weeks. It works fine and we're happy with it. However, a word of caution is in order. It is described as a 3 cup coffee press. It is 3 very small cups. It will hold 1 1/2 measuring cups at most. Also, the instructions warn to not pour boiling water into it. Huh? Seems like that would be a necessity for making coffee, but the glass is very thin and apparently boiling water may break it. But if you don't need coffee for 3 people and are willing to heat it up a little in the microwave after it is ready, the press works great."
4,French press,I love coffee from these gizmos. Always fresh and delicious. I have had two of these coffee makers before and broke them both by accident. I don't know how they can call it a 3-cup press because I can only get one decent sized cup out of it.
4,Small and time consuming but well worth it,"First, the Bodum Chambord 3-Cup coffee press is the best way to enjoy your morning cup of joe. Not only does the french pressed coffee preserve the oils and taste better, you avoid using filters or any of the necessaries of a coffee machine. It can be time consuming to have to get a pot a fill it with water and wait for it to boil. But my little secret is that I grind the coffee beans while waiting. Once you boil the water, you simply pour onto the grounds and voila---fresh coffee. Nothing beats the taste. Easy to clean.Note that the 3-cup press really makes one generous (i.e. large) cup of coffee in a standard mug. If you think you can drink more or you serve others during breakfast, then purchase the 8-cup press. Also don't be fooled by the Amazon or box picture. This thing is really tiny. But the flipside is its easy to store when not in use.Highly recommended for the price."
3,"OK, but not the best","This was originally billed as a 3 cup model. I note that it is now the ""12 ounce"" model. More accurate, since you'll be lucky to get 1-1/2 5 oz. cups out of it. Also, it is very hard to remove the plunger when the unit is still warm. I have found that running it under cold water first makes the removal task much easier. Still, I would recommend the next size up."
1,Flawed components,"The glass beaker of the first press that I recieved was broken at the base when I recieved it. This breakage was in spite of no apperent damage to the box it came in. I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent a replacement.The beaker of the replacement press was fine and I use the press for making tea three or four time during the first 24 hours in my posetion. I was mindful to be careful of the beaker during handling. Then on the last usage I noticed a crack extending the lenght of the the beaker. The second beaker had also failed!Nice idea but execution is badly flawed and a better, more robust beaker design is needed. I would not give it any star but that would look like I had not rated it."
3,I got it! Three DEMITASSE cups!,"The coffee it produces tastes terrific. But ""three cups?"" If you leave the recommended space above the water of 1 inch, it barely holds one measuring cup of water -- barely. I wish I had known this before I purchased it because one cup of coffee in the AM for this old broad just isn't quite enough. I'll keep it, but it's not going to be used daily."
4,As good as ever,"Just purchased a 12-oz press to keep at the office, bringing my total to 3. These are simple and straightforward.The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the sense that the Bodum pricing is a bit inflated."
4,Makes an OK Cup,"My sister loves this thing enough to pass up Starbucks everyday - but not enough to give up Starbucks entirely. If you're trying to save a buck by making your own coffee, this does the trick. Match it with a good coffee grinder, and you're gold."
2,Three cups? More like one...,"Bought this quickly without reading product information carefully. If I had, I would have seen that this makes 12 ounces of coffee. I am not sure by whose standards that equals three cups... perhaps in Munchkinland... Here on Planet Earth, it comes out to about 1 and a half small sized mugs. So, if that's the amount you're looking for, this is for you. If you, as I was, are looking for something compact that will give you 3 decent sized cups of coffee in the a.m., keep looking. (Hint: pour 12 ounces of water into a measuring cup to get an idea of how much coffee this press can make).Aside from these problems (which shaky wording of product title aside, are due to my own carelessness) the thing seems well made. Still, price seems high for something so small and dainty. Coffee made in press was fine."
1,coffee press,This coffee maker came broken. The shipper just put the product box in a box without packing. It was shattered in a million pieces.
2,Bodum Chambord 12 oz. Coffee Press,"It looks nice.It doesn't press coffee all the way into the bottom, thus leaving the brew a bit weak and wasteful of ground coffee.It is over rated considering the high price."
2,Too small,"I read the 3 cup description and the 12 oz. description did not register with me. When I received it, I realized the 3 cup measurement was actually 1/2 cup each. This device was much too small for my needs."
3,Bodem 3 cup coffee press,"Generally happy with this, but what could wrong with something so simple? Generally looks to be of fine quality and looks stylish on the counter top. So why did i give only three stars? I wanted something that would make three cups of coffee. It's in the name! In reality it barley makes one. What definition of 'cup' are they using? Anyway for now I will continue to make my guests coffee, one cup at a time :("
2,Too expensive,The coffemakeer works fine. But it is about $10 overpriced on Amazon. I bought only bcs my local source was out of stock.
2,Too tiny,"I personally think this coffee press is too small to be functional. It holds about 10oz. It's easy to clean and is useful if you are traveling, but not very suitable for use at home."
1,Hard to rate when it's not here,"I would love to rate this a five, as I am sure it is a great product. However, I ordered it April 16th and the expected date of delivery? July!I went through Amazon because I did not want to deal with the delay in going through Ebay, as far as bidding, etc.I think I'll look at Ebay so I can use the product (Mothers Day gift) before our anniversary (Sept.).This is ridiculous."
1,Bodum Review,"While coffee tasted fresh, it was very difficult to measure strength of coffee. The ""3-cup"" measure is misleading because US machines count 6oz of liquid per cup whereas this unit counts 4oz per cup. Thus, by US standards, you are getting 2 cups. Also, I did not know until opening the package that you can ONLY use course grinds. This is inconvenient and not part of my habit. I would prefer to return this now useless product. Making gourmet coffee at work shouldn't be a hassle. I'm not changing my habits for the Bodum. Instead, I purchased a travel mug and make my own coffee for the commute to work. The gadget is more suitable to my lifestyle."
5,I use fine ground - maybe I'm crazy!!!,"I understand the caution against fine ground coffee in this device. I have been impatient and caused a mess on the counter enough times to be wary. But I want real robust coffee flavor and I am wiling to put up with sediment at the bottom of my cup. So I finely grind my (home roasted) beans. I wait about 2 or 3 minutes and then I carefully and slowly plunge. I also pour slowly and don't pour past 90 degrees to get minimal grounds in my coffee. Using this method, I sometimes get a floating tiny piece of coffee but that's it an the flavor is very rich. At the bottom of my mug there will be sediment. That's the price. However you enjoy it..."
4,Always read the reviews,A beautiful little piece of art for the kitchen. I wish I had read the reviews instead of thinking a three cup press would make 3 cups of coffee.Live and learn. I will obviously be making twice as many batches thanks to the problem with translating 3 cups to mean 24 ounces instead of 12 ounces.
1,Poor,"Terrible. Let's a copious amount of grounds through every time - from the moment I bought it. I tried a variety of grinds. Also, Bodum refused to replace the filter. POOR POOR POOR DO NOT BUY."
3,It's OK- smaller than I thought,"Overall for the size, it is nice and sturdy. However, for the travel coffee mug I wanted to use it with... I should have gone larger. Just be sure to measure before you buy."
1,Too small poor filtering,This french press is good for about one cup of coffee. THere is way too much residue and grinds that the press filter does not get out of the coffee. Maybe a larger one would work better.
3,Glass not held in place as well as Brazil,"I washed the glass out and turned it over to pour excess water out and found out it was not held in place like my Brazil 8 cup. The screw that tightens the band that holds the beaker in place wasn't tightened. Oh well, you live and learn"
4,"Excellent quality, but...",Pros:Looks greatWorks greatPerfect for my morning roastCons:PriceTechnique takes awhile to get it right *although this has nothing to do with the product*
2,Too Fragile,"It makes really delicious coffee, but it is too fragile. The glass cracked during the 5th use. Now I'm ordering a stain-less one."
4,Great For One Cup,Follow directions and you won't be disappointed in your purchase. It makes a great cup of coffee using a coarse grind of your favorite brand. I consider a cup of coffee more than 3 or 4 ounces so this 3 cup maker only makes one cup for me and besides without a heating element or insulation any extra cups would get cold anyway.
2,Boring.,"So a kid joins a boring otaku club where they do nothing but talk about porn and play video games. Yep that's the gist of it.With all the amazing reviews, I thought I'd give this one a chance, but I'm disappointed. Pretty boring 'storyline', none of the characters are likable, kind of a silly emphasis on porn, not particularly funny. I don't really see this manga going anywhere...pros: the art is nice and simple and the characters are distinguishable from each other.overall, an overrated manga. If you're easily amused and want to read about people doing the same boring stuff you can do in real life, then go right on ahead with Genshiken!"
3,Quality is only average,"The description of these sheets implies a superior product. It's not. A thread count this high should mean the sheets have a smoother, softer feel than is typical. The fabric itself, ""sateen"", is also supposed to mean a higher level of softness and smoothness. Unfortunately, while these sheets aren't bad, they're no softer or less coarse than what you can get at your local discount department store, and are inferior to a 400 count set from Macy's which I received as a housewarming present."
4,"Substantial, well-made, but not soft","At this price, these pillowcases from a high-end manufacturer are worth purchasing. The pros are: (a) substantial, heavy-weight fabric; (b) no bleeding or fading of wine color; (c) cut generously so you don't have to stuff the pillows into them and no part of the pillow extends beyond the case; and (d) very well-sewn. The only negative is that the fabric, while not scratchy, is not buttery soft as you might expect from a high-thread-count pillowcase. Overall, though, I'm pleased and would buy these again."
3,An Improvement on Book 1,Book one was basically the setup for the story that finally gets moving in this book. Having the alternate Sulu and Chekov interacting with each others counterparts is interesting but not. The young Kirk comes across as a typical teenager. The L. A. Graf writing team have written Uhura Chekov and Sulu stories before and are once again on the mark.
3,Good book-sort of a let down,"This book was still very good, and is a good timeline novel, but it is not the best of the three in the series. The book makes a good effort with the Scheenag, but the end falls apart in a strange cliffhanger."
4,Good deal for the price point,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my daughter's 9th birthday. She requested binoculars so I wanted to give her something that was durable, water resistant and with decent optics, but not for $75-$100. These seem to meet all those criteria. I would be happy to use them for camping or at concerts. The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because I just don't know how water resistant they are -- haven't been in the rain with them. I advised my daughter NOT to test them for water resistance!"
3,Celestron 8x25 outland review,"I received the Celestron Outland 8x21 compact binoculars today from Amazon. I give you here my first impressions. The optics are about average or a little better for inexpensive binoculars ($35). The parallax alignment seems to be good. The diopter setting is off zero by a wide margin. The field of view is somewhat limited but not pipelike. The long eye relief seems to work well with glasses. The rubber around the right eye lens was not fitted properly and probably would not be water tight. The image clarity in the center of the field was quite good but field curvature reduced it substantially starting about one third out toward the edges. The binoculars seemed a little heavy for their size but had a solid feel. The focus worked smothly. The best feature was the eye relief. Other than that, they were unspectacular in this price range. I haven't decided whether to keep them. If I do we will see how they hold up."
2,Not pleased,"I chose these because of the optics, BAK-4, multi-coated, etc. And they may be great, but I rejected them out of the box because the other design considerations were lacking. The neck cord is a shoestring and there are no ""handles"" to attach a comfortable strap. The weight ""feels"" a lot heavier than the specification. Comparing these to my old porro-prism Bushnells, I think the porros are more compact. Definitely lighter. I'll be re-ordering something along those lines."
3,This Game Sucks,"You can find much better hunting games for free on the net. Gosh, it's so bad. All you do is sit in one place with your weapon and wait for a turkey to come by! Thats it. And the graphics, oh man, it looks like some hobo took a dumb on the screen. And the turkeys look like little blobs walking around. The only reason I didn't give this game 2 stars overall was because it didn't freeze up or break down. I guess that's one good thing. Anyways, don't buy it. It stinks."
2,"Wasn't expecting much, movie was as expected.","This was cringe-worthy.I was hoping for something light-hearted and funny, and ended up with a cliche-driven, spring break-ish romp, winter style.This may find an audience with teenagers in Europe."
4,Loved this movie!,It was great to see Ed Westwick not being Chuck Bass even though he did a fantastic job with that character! The story was sweet and funny.
3,Eh.,"Cute, but I don't think I'd ever watch it again. I don't quite understand Europe's fascination with public nudity. The language wasn't necessary either."
2,Not For Your Sunday School Kids.,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I had waited weeks for it to come out, thinking it would be a cute movie to share with my little nieces who are in their early teens. I'm awfully glad I watched it before I showed it to them. I won't be sharing this video now. The trailers and advertisements try to make you think it's a cute little movie about skiing in the beautiful Alps of Austria. What you really get is a very few clips of the Alps and several of young girls getting drunk, running around naked, and sleeping with boys they've just met on the slopes. I was surprised that Brooke Shields would stoop to appear in such a shallow movie, however, we must remember that she gained her notoriety by playing the part of a little child hooker long ago."
4,A great in depth look at the Birdman from Alcatraz,"This book, chosen for my psychology class is a great one. It offers a look at Robert Stroud's life before, during, and after his time was served at Alcatraz. It proved that he is NOT only a murderer that served time but that he truly believed that the prison was serving him time. It is an excellent book about history, psychology and a man of many identities. A must read but not the best book in the world."
4,The book to read on Stroud,"This is a thoroughly research piece of work and effectively dispels the mythology surrounding Robert Stroud. The author writes in a lively and engaging style. As other reviewers note, though, the work is much in need of editing. It features occasional incorrect word usage, mistakes in punctuation and problems in sentence structure. These are particularly notable in the book's early chapters. Despite these flaws, it's an empirically sound work that will answer your questions about the sad case of Robert Stroud."
3,Demonizing Diatribe!,"While I thought Ms. Babyak's version of events was interesting, I think that she wrote this book out of envy.In my opinion Ms. Babyak's envy came from the fact that Robert Stroud was portrayed as well as he was in the 1962 film, The Birdman of Alcatraz, as Burt Lancaster even received an Academy Award Nomination for his performance as Robert Stroud.Although I do not believe Ms. Babyak is aware of her own possible pathologies, which appear very deep-seated, you can read her resentment towards Robert Stroud, as her own written words seem to say, 'I'll be damned if The Bird Man of Leavenworth is going to get a good rap', as though she's on a mission to take out Hollywood's United Artists.I am very surprised that Ms. Babyak didn't at some point in her life (prior to his death in 2002) attempt to finish off The Birdman of Alcatraz film director, John Frankenheimer--as she'd be screaming 'HOW DARE YOU' while pulling the trigger."
2,not as pictured,"The chock I received had no tether cord, nor a hole to mount it. Also, the structure as viewed from the side is quite different. I am not sure if they redesigned it, or if it is the wrong one. Either way, it is a disappointment.It IS a hard plastic and slides on some floors, but seems to grip pavement well."
5,"For a few extra bucks, my life is in better hands.","I have used the metal flap kind, and the cheap black plastic kind, and only for a difference of a few dollars these are far better. It really ""grips"" the tires and the tires will not budge. The plastic is not as strong as I'd like, and will break if you accidently forget and drive over them, but they do their job. I have seen heavier rubber ones that are better but they are more expensive. This product is a good compromise in quality and price. After-all, i just wanted to be safe and I wanted it to be cheap, and it has done both of these things. I recommand these over the flap kind and the black plastic kind."
5,works well,"works well, easy to store...light weight and the string makes pulling it out from my wheels easier. I purchased 4 of these thinking I needed them for front and back wheels, but really only needed them for either front or back use at one time...still... I have an extra set just in case I ever leave them somewhere by accident."
4,work good,I have no complaints aobut thsee chocks. We use them for our water vehicles and motorcycle trailer. Stay in place and the string is a great addition. Not as wide as a standard tire but will do the job for what we have. I have 4 and will buy more.
4,Works just great for my travel trailer,They work just great for what I want. I have two sets of them that I use on my travel trailer. Will buy two more sets when the others that I use wear out.
4,Perfect small boat chock,"I ordered two of these wheel chocks to stabilize my small boat trailer and boat. They are light, sturdy and do the job well. For the price, they will be hard to beat for anyone needing a light weight chock."
3,Functional Chock,"Works as indicated and is readily visible due to the red color. Not overly excited about the chock, but I have no complaint either."
3,"Made of plastic, not rubber","Got a set of these wheel chocks because I was tired of my wife running over the hollow plastic kind (those that are stackable) and crushing them.As other reviewers have mentioned, these chocks are sold as singles, so order two of them if you need a pair. The chocks are made of hard plastic (and not rubber as mentioned in another product review) but they seem to be well supported internally and hopefully won't crush unless she builds up a head of steam and peels out on top of them. I wish they were rubber, not plastic.I do think the red color will make them more visible than our current black set so maybe they won't be missed as much when in place. They are a bit smaller than I expected."
4,"Nice chock, but note: it's only *1* chock","For some reason I expected a pair of them... It's a nice chock though, and I'm ordering a mate for it..."
2,"Not for small tires, rubber would be better","These wheel chocks are well made and solid, but rubber ones would be better for smaller tires. I put them under the wheels of my trailer and I was still able to push the trailer forward as the chocks were sliding along the asphalt. My trailer wheels are smaller than car tires, so that is probably why they do not work so well. The point of contact between the tire and the wheel chock was just the front edge of the chock. With bigger tires, these chocks might be great, but for my smaller trailer tires, a couple of bricks would work better than these chocks."
2,Hard Plastic and Small Too!,"You just don't expect these to be made of hard plastic and so small. But then you look at the price and kick yourself for expecting more. They work, but I highly doubt they'll still be around in 10 years."
4,It works,What can you say about a wheel chock? It holds the trailer in place as it is intended to do.
3,"Not bad, but not great","Pros:The construction of the chocks seems solid and they look like they would last a long time.The price is low enough.Cons:These are very skinny/narrow. They don't even cover the tires of my Honda Accord, let alone my F-150.The profile (height) of the chock isn't high enough to inspires any confidence about its stopping ability.They do not grip the floor well. At least the chocks I received did not have the small rubber boots that are typical on Rhino ramps, etc.All in all, not a bad buy. The material and construction is good. How useful they actually are, depends on what you expect out of them."
4,Does it's job,"As the title says,does its job.Might not want to use it for a Tractor Trailer :),but for any thing else these work well.Light weight,quality made,and does the job."
4,Great Value,"These little chocks work great on a flat surface. I didn't trust them on an incline in my driveway with a trailer loaded with quads. Plastic and concrete didn't seem too grippy. Off road, or at a camp spot, I'm sure they perform great also."
4,Instant Classic,"Originally, I thought the movie is going to be dry and dull to watch. Surprisingly, it's captivating and been made intelligently. It never condescends and telling it as it is about the necessity of letting journalists doing what they are good at, telling stories as they are in an impartial way. Despite fanaticism during McCarthy era, thumbs up to CBS for standing tall and proud albeit cautiously debating about justification of witch hunting and destroying people's lives along the way for allegedly being communist and/or communist sympathisers. This reminds me also of the Russian journalist, Anna that was a victim of contract killing in Russia last year for her coverage of issues ranging from Putin, Checnya, Beslan, mafias in Russia, corruption and so forth. It's truly remarkable to see certain people that show fighting spirit and courage under fire. Truly an inspiration for us to take a stand when it is required. Commendable watching."
4,Important event but mixed results,"With Hollywood concentrating on mindless shoot em ups and maybe some people stories, it's great to see a political subject being addressed. The story is compelling in itself and the dilemma of the makers is how much to assume the watchers know about the subject matter. If you know a lot you may want something more in depth. It does give a good view of what that period was like and how it came about. The acting is top notch but sometimes the narrative falters. Overall worthwhile,mainly for content but not for its film achievement."
3,Lacks Historical Contex,"Good Night and Good Luck is a taunt, well made film about how Edward R. Morrow helped to take down Joe McCarthey during the height of the so-called ""red scare"" of the early 1950s. Unfortunately it lacks historical contex. Someone, seeing the movie, might wonder who were these communists and why were everyone so afraid, not only of them, but of being accused of being one."
2,Disappointed,Edward R. Murrow was a great commentator. I listened to him for years. This movie was more of a documentary about Senator McCarthy than about the career of Murrow.
3,Unremarkable.,"McCarthy was a fascist. Murrow had the balls to oppose him in his news broadcasts.If there was something else there I missed it. If Clooney hadn't been associated with this movie, it wouldn't have been made."
2,What's All the Fuss About?,"The lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real Edward R. Murrow, and there was a lot of realistic smoking for a movie set in the `50s, but otherwise I'd didn't understand all the adulation for what was to me a short, boring movie that seemed much longer. Maybe I've just seen too many biopics lately."
3,You must see it at least once.,"""Goodnight and Good Luck"" was a interesting piece. For one, it's in black and white. Another, there was no musical score. It is like witnessing the account first hand. I found that it was a clever and witty movie. However, it is a lot like a documentary. The subject matter was about communism and how many of the government's high ranking officials dealt with it. Even with the sharp commentary, it still failed to completely capture my attention.Kudos to the cast and to their wonderful portrayals of their characters, but this is one movie that will not be going into my DVD collection."
2,walk the line was wronged!!!,"Acording to academy award movie judges, walk the line was not nominated for best picture because Good night, and good luck knocked it out of running. That was a huge mistake. here are three reasons:1. Walk the line had much better drama and had a storyline that people can relate to. Unlike good night, and good luck who would have to live in the fortys to appreciate(unlike me).2. try watching good night, and good luck without falling asleep!3. Walk the line was terrific.Those are my reasons."
3,Excellency in the art we call film,"Who knew that George Clooney could be such a great director? This film should have won Best Picture at the Oscars. If you want to see a good film that was nominated for some Oscars this year but you don't have time to see them all then see Good Night, and Good Luck. Although it's been said numerous times, the cinematography was wonderfully done to fit the 50's. If there is one movie that sums up 2005, it is Good Night, and Good Luck."
3,"Interesting, but not particuolarly involving","I admired this film much more than I liked it. The history was generally accurate (I'm old enough to remember the McCarthy era), and the way the details are interwoven is interesting. Still, one of the hazards of this type of piece is that it can get too ""talky"", and this did.Docudramas are tough to do well - and especially so if the action is mostly talking heads. All of the performances as well as George Clooney's direction are top-notch. The drama was all there, but the film delivered depression when it should have delivered tension. This was a very tense and paranoid time in U.S. history. The paranoia is there, but the overall feel is gloomy rather than tense.Perhaps if the off-the-air shots had been done in color, it would have worked better. The B&W; gave it a film noir feel with few of the other qualities associated with a good B&W; film."
4,DVD Godbye and Good Luck,"I was intersted in it because I was a teen during that time and remember the intensity and questions I asked. I have a greater understanding of the overall happenings through film, though it is a dramitization of events. Edward R. Morrow had great courage to take the stand he did and it is an example for everyone to be alert and to think rather than just accept the opinions of one person or group."
2,Good Night and Good Snore,"The movie was 93 mins. long yet I felt like I sat through a 180 minute boring and dragging movie. Don't get me wrong, I have an understanding of the media and know about Edward R. Murrow, the cinematography was good, the whole idea of using actual footage of McCarthy worked in a clever way, but it was just way too boring. I mean, I was dozing at the movie theater, nuff said."
3,Snore!,"Ok, good actors do not necessarily a great movie make. Everything is well done and very politically correct but it makes kind of boring cinema..."
1,Decidedly Unsensational,"This movie is trying desperately to be part of the same genre as 'JFK' and 'All The President's Men', but it doesn't even deserve to be in their shadow. They must be getting desperate for things to make movies about! There was nothing sensational enough to create this movie from in the first place, which is one reason why it didn't work. It was pointless and tedious and didn't grab me at all. A waste of money and time, both for creators, and the viewers. A further annoyance was the decision to make the film entirely in black and white. It may come across as 'arty' to some people, but I paid for a colour TV to watch movies in colour, not black and white. Some people loved it; I didn't."
4,A minor classic,"This first major directorial motion picture by George Clooney works really well. A good cast, and in particular David Strathairn as Edward R Murrow deliver excellent performances in this true story of Murrow's battle to expose Senator McCarthy's witch-hunt against mainly innocent people.The film is beautifully shot in black and white, which baring in mind this all happened in the 1950's is completely appropriate. It also meant that Clooney could incorporate real footage of McCarthy rather than using an actor, and this certainly adds to the authenticity of the film.The film is short (90mins), and perhaps a bit more time could have been spent exploring the misery that McCarthy inflicted on many people with his witch-hunt. However that is minor gripe for what is otherwise a classy piece of film-making."
4,RFK,"These are wonderful reviews; however every writer omitted two things: the man Senator Joseph McCarthy asked to take over for him during his grilling of a Black congressional waitress was Roy Cohn who hated homosexuals even though he was one himself. And, if one looks at the footage carefully --- far right screen. There sits Robert Kennedy. The hypocrite! A staff member of the McCarthy Committee who never said a word against this tyrant."
5,Excellent movie,Strongly recommend this movie -- it takes us through a crucial period of US history when important decisions were being made. Very interesting contrast to the crap that masquerades as real news nowadays.
4,Whatever happened to CBS news?,"Much in the same way as ""The Insider"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"" does a great job of showing CBS News when it was at its best--when it cared more about the news and not sensationalism. David Strathairn does a great Edward R. Murrow, and George Clooney is excellent as Fred Friendly. The film does a great job of displaying the struggles of Murrow taking on both Bill Paley but also Joseph McCarthy. Murrow, fighting to give the public decent news, realizes that news is becoming a playground for superficial stories, and tries to keep his show above such nonsense. His stand against McCarthy, while admirable, ultimately still does not save his show. A great story and great insight to Murrow."
4,Broadcaster Murrow vs. Senator McCarthy - 1954,"This film deals with 1950's journalism and politics. It depicts the CBS News investigation of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Done by CBS television's ""See It Now"" unit, the program sought to show how Senator McCarthy was misusing his investigative power.Senator McCarthy claimed he was trying to find Communists within the government. So far as is known, he didn't find any Communists but he gained a lot of public attention for his investigations.The film - done from an inside perspective at CBS News - is a period piece, but rather an interesting one. It shows how much sweat and toil went into producing the story on McCarthy and its aftermath.Edward R. Murrow and ""See it Now"" produced what has come to be recognized as a historic documentary. Told in flashback from 1958, when Murrow gave a speech critical of the broadcast industry, this is a film well worth seeing."
2,A Little Disappointing,"Since I really enjoy historical films, I viewed the film with great anticipation. I came away from it feeling let down, not by the performances, but by the lack of tension and drama that a film of this era should pack. I've seen this riveting subject about a significant time in American history done better as a documentary. Not in the same class as ""All The President's Men"" or even ""Quiz Show""."
3,It was a good movie.,If you do not know your history during the McCarthy/Communist era of the 1950's. It is hard to understand what they are talking about. Need more background information.
5,A wonderful defense for Senator McCarthy,"I thought this movie perfectly illustrated the dangers of International Communism and the need for a strong defense against internal subversion. The only way we can remain a free people is by a constant examination of ourselves and the institutions under which we live. I only thank God that someone responsible has made such an illuminating movie, since it shows what godless heathens we were engaged in such a titanic struggle against. God bless George Clooney and the courage it takes to make such a timely movie. I only hope the rest of the country understands the importance of facing down such evil in the defense of liberty. Lives hang in the balance."
2,Well done movie...,"... But it is not the truth. Since the wall fell, we have learned that old joe was right. Hey, I bet in a few years Clooney will make a film about how honest and truthful Bill Clinton was!"
1,Long and boring,"If you liked school, and you liked watching films in school, this may be for you. It's hardly entertainment, and may possibly be one of the most overrated films of all-time."
1,Yawn fest!,I fell asleep at the theater not even half way through this bore. I don't see what all the critical acclaim was for. And what's with the woman singing in-between the archival footage of Senator McCarthy? Gads. Go watch anything else. This film certainly won't make you think!
2,Disappointing,"I suspect people's enthusiasm for this movie is due to the real footage of the McCarthy hearings, footage that we don't see often enough and reminds us how careful we should be not to go down that route again. (McCarthy enjoyed huge support at some point, after all.) For people like me who had already seen the footage in the PBS documentary on Ed Murrow (""The Edward R. Murrow Collection"", DVD, 2005), the movie fell absolutely flat. There is no original story line, no character development. I guess its redeeming feature was to push PBS to package the documentary, since it came out at about the same time. My advice to anyone considering buying the ""Good Night, and Good Luck"" DVD would be to buy ""The Edward R. Murrow Collection"" instead."
3,Almost Too Much Like Watching A Documentary,"George Clooney has come into his own as a writer and director. His attention to detail and realism, rivals almost anything else I've seen out there in years. It's almost too much like watching a documentary. A bit talky for its 93 minutes, but should be seen by Americans as a reminder of modern-day witch hunts, and how the lives of innocent people are sucked-in and destroyed. The real star of this film however, is David Strathairn's effective portrayal of Edward R. Murrow. One of the better biographical characterizations by any actor. This is not a film I'll be watching over-and-over again though."
4,SLICE OF HISTORY,"Good movie. Good acting. Almost could pass for a documentry. Had me looking at the credits to see who the performers were in the hearing. After going through it again I realized, the actual hearings were being used. Now that's a movie!"
5,Count Me In,"among those who think this is an absolutely terrific film. I lived in the times portrayed, and this is an accurate picture of those times. I won't take time and space to repeat everything others have said in praise of everyone connected with the film. Just two personal reactions: an urge to cheer because of the excellence of the film; an urge to weep for our country because Murrow's warning that TV could easily become only lights and wires in a box has come resoundingly true."
3,"Slow-moving, and the black-and-white format does not work","I'm as against McCarthyism as the next fellow. Unfortunately, this movie is slow-moving, and the black-and-white format fails to lend it the air of authenticity that the creators obviously intended.Like too many Hollywood films these days, this one takes itself pretty seriously, and this gets in the way of what could have been a pretty effective ""Good versus Evil"" story against McCarthyism, which was a genuine illness of the American body politic. No matter how serious the subject matter, the purpose of this kind of film is to entertain and to tell an interesting story. This seems to have been forgotten in the zeal to make a political statement.On a minor historical note, it was not ""courageous newsmen"" who brought McCarthy down. It was President Eisenhower and the US Army who did that."
2,Nice but not that well,"After the Oscar Award evenning. We can absolutely trust this movie is going to be a master piece of script, performance and cinematography.Well i do not deny the force of this factors, it is a great movie indeed. And Clooney did a splendid work on it. His fellow friend Soderberg can be proud of the legacy he remained on him but the movie is boring.It is not about the black and white technique, is not about the dense dialogs, is not about the topic of the plot, is just the rhythm and development of the story is too much for the one hundred and peek minutes of the movie.Great performances, i personaly love Clarkson, Downey Jr, Clooney and Strathairn. Must see it but i am still not convinced further than an oustanding movie."
5,great movie with significance in politics today,"This movie showed to me that the McCarthy era in the fifties with its witch hunts, clearly projects to the Bush-Cheney era around 2002-2003, when people critical towards the war in Iraq were stigmatized, lost their jobs etc.An important document for the triumph of true freedom and free speech, more relevant today than it ever was!"
3,"Anti-climactic, as was the career of Murrow at CBS","A must see history lesson, especially for anyone under 40 years old. But don't expect to end up with much sense of gratification. It's worth seeing, but it probably won't end up on many people's favorite lists."
5,Story well told,I found this story well directed and acted. All the characters were well fleshed out and believable. I remember watching Edgar R. Morrow on TV and almost felt like I was watching him again in the movie. Loved it so much I have purchased the DVD so I can watch it again and again.
4,"Good film, but....","I really liked this story and felt like I learned something about the McCarthy trials and the psycho communist obsession that existed in that time. As a person who is currently living in China, it was interesting to see that perspective.One of the most profound moments in the film is when the brodcaster is talking about a book that was dedicated to him. It was dedicated by one of his socialist friends. However, he said that the beauty of their friendship was that they could exchange ideas and have differing philosophies and still be friends. He said that the dialogue was an important thing. I agree 100% and the film is worth the price of admission or rental just for that moment.As for the rest of the film... I believe that it captures the essence of that time period. If you are older this might be a good movie for you to see and give a critique since you lived through it. I would recommend it, but I give it 4 stars becasue it only grabbed me tightly at that one part."
2,Boring,I own this and thought I would like it much more than I did. The acting is very good but it is very boring and I almost fell asleep. Maybe I'm too young--40 to remember it but I found it slow and boring.
4,Thank you Clooney,"A highly enjoyable film that gives us a glimpes at the Edward Murrow response to McCarthyism. Smoke filled black and white photography, and performances from jazz diva Diane Reeves, as a studio singer, draw the audience in. In short, a story told well, to be enjoyed by an adult audience. Bravo Mr. Clooney!"
2,Not Original but well done,I give this a 2 not because the film wasn't a good one but because not too mucch initiative nor thought had to have gone into a recreation of historic fact.This was mostly a film of archive footage and having a actor sit in front a camera and copy the style of a journalist.Not unique and I cant see it standing any tests of time.
1,Godawful movie,I bought this DVD after the Oscar hype. It is perhaps one of the worst movies I have seen.I can't figure out which is more atrocious - the screen play or meandering direction. Basically it is like a 20 minute documentary stretched out to full length movie with lots of unnecessary plot diversions.AWFUL!!!
1,Much ado about nothing,"This has to be the most boring movie I have ever had the misfortune to see. It's one of those movies that no one watches and everyone talks about. Honestly, I have never looked at my watch so often during a film. 90-odd minutes of pure tedium."
1,Black and White movies are passe.,"This film showed Ed Morrow and his associates filmed in black and white watching themselves in black and white!Why may I ask why was this film made in Black and White? I waited and waited whilst more and more losing interest in the content of the film looking for a reason why it was filmed in black and white! I did not find any valid reason and can only point out to the producers of this film that yes, television in those heady days was indeed black and white but for heavens sake everything else including the participants were in full glorious colour! Is it that many young film producers are having a bit of fun messing around with a non existant black and white world because of the ""artistic value"" of the long dead black and white depicted world of long ago?Please let us have no more of this silly nonsense!"
1,Like a long lecture by a very boring professor,"I was eager to watch this film and like it. This movie is the definition of lackluster. Dull, boring, and dry. There is no attempt to explain the real reason for anti-communist paranoia and that makes the film feel historically unbalanced.Controversy always has more than one side. There simply isn't much room in Clooney's world for type of real controversy that would have given the film some dramatic tension and turned it into serious entertainment. Don't lose your time watching this. Stay away from this movie."
4,Alma Mater sheds an interesting light on women's colleges.,"I really liked the way Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz looked at the physical structure and plan of the seven sister colleges to interpret their varying purposes and views on higher education of women. I am currently studying the history of Radcliffe, and I found Alma Mater enlightening and valuable."
4,blue dragon,the dragon has nice detail and the blue crystal is nice and clear. It is impossible to find this item in local jewerly stores and or flea markets in my area. This was a good fine.Vincent LauriaShirley L. I. NY
3,got what i paid for,"this item picture showed that the item is silver and shiny and when i received it, it was a dark silver, still a good buy for the price, but if your wanting something shiny bright and noticeable this isnt it, still served my purpose for a christmas gift, and the person receiving it liked it, so overall a good cheap buy."
4,Must Have,This is a classic club hit. U Got to Know. It use to be the Houston Rockets Theme Music during the mid 90s championship run. A must have!
4,Field Marshall,"This is the only purchase ever made from Amazon.com. However, purchase two different Reich Marshal books, and received two of the same... preposterous and ludicrous but are Amazon.com predatory tactics."
2,Incomplete..Too much in awe of him.,"Although the book gives you a feel of being there, and a good overall view of Goering the author fails in a number of areas. He points out that Goering was able to charm an employee in the French Embassy, but why didn't he do the same to England. The answer is that he did. He had Nevile Henderson wrapped around his finger. Also he leaves out some of the less savory things that Goering did and is too adulatory. Perhaps because he met him and had a good time with him, his chief biographer failed to capture the true Goering."
4,Very cool,"The descriptions on the back cover sounded interesting, so I gave this disc a try. It was worth it.""Lily and Jim"" alone is worth the price of admission. It kept me laughing throughout.""Kom"" is a sweet short that will surprise you, and make you smile.""Anticipating Sarah"" will be no surprise to anyone who has read the story in one of the Chicken Soup for the Soul books.""Hisao"" was a little disappointing, but still kind of interesting.""The Last Supper"" is fabulous, a perfect example of ""watch out what you wish for, for you just might get it.""""DigiPet"" should be DigiPutDown. It's annoying as hell.It would be nice to be able to fast forward through some of the commercials, but a couple of them are kind of fun to watch.There's audio commentary tracks and production notes galore throughout, pretty much insuring that this won't be one of those things that you sit through once and never watch again."
4,"This one is great, but ""Method for the Bassoon"" is the best Weissenborn","Others have written about the book's quality. It's a bit daunting for beginners, but someone has written a ""My First Weissenborn"" for bassoon newbies. I have ""Practical Method"" and have used it for years. However, there is another version of Weissenborn called just ""Method for Bassoon,"" which is 159 pages long and has a brown cover. The additional material is a popular set of key studies by Milde which are often assigned to students.When I moved and had to get a new teacher, she assigned the Milde studies. So I bought the ""Method for Bassoon"" book to replace my old, beat up ""Practical Method"" book, even thought Milde studies are also available separately. Either book will carry a student along for years of learning. Amazon doesn't seem to have the ""Method"" book available as I write this, but it's worth getting that version at another outlet. At some of the sheet music sources, both versions are even the same price!"
4,B! Machine returns...,"Another great disc by B! Machine. I always have fond memories of Nowhere Girl, and this album brings me back to that. Buy this if you love synthpop."
3,Government is cool!,"This book is very helpful and in good shape. Nothing is missing, but you can tell it has been used."
1,Just another college text book,"Low rating only because it is a college text book, i purchased it and never used it, the instructor dicided to change books after I received it."
1,??,i had to return the book. i got an emailed saying to return it and as soon as they got the book they would refund my money.its been about 2 weeks already and they havent refund my money yet. they arent a good business and dont committ to their costumers.
4,Fit for a Communication major,"A simplified guide to writing that is great for undergraduates in college who need to know both MLA and APA. The writing guide also has content for writing styles, along with practical examples fit for the Communication field. Nice job Dr. Adams."
5,this book should be on oprah,"I can't say enough good things about this book. I've been a frustrated filmmaker for years and thanks to this book, I've finally launched my company, R.E. Shortz.Everyone who has any interest in being an artist or even being more creative, should buy at least two of these."
4,"""A must see""spy thriller!","This is a first rate version of this 1967 movie,and the picture as well as the soundquality is stunning!(worth mentioning since Sinister cinema seldom has a chance to make transfers like this one, and is often critisised for their products) Legendary Henry Silva, known mostly for his superb bad guy parts, here has a rare, ordinary guy (Well, not exactly..) starring role, as an american agent with a death sentence over his head, who gets a second chanse taking over his brothers identity, in order to kill an important politician. This is a diffrent and exciting movie that looks fantastic. Its well made in every department, and it has a really groovy soundtrack! The story takes place mostly in the U.S and Germany, but its an italian production also starring the talanted and beutiful ""Evelyn Stewart"" (Ida Galli)From Jolly film productions, who also produced ""A Fistful of dollars"" and ""Grand slam"" They made some great movies, and this is one of them! Strongly recomended!!!"
5,REWEAVING THE GRAND TAPESTRY,"The final volume of this magnificent trilogy moves the legend of Ariadne and the minotaur across the first 3200 years of known western history to post-Cromwell London where the Achaen demigods and Celtic gods and creatures of Faerie merge and interact in ways as convoluted as the passages of the Trojan Labyrinth through which the hugely imaginative tale travels, weaving a magnificent and ever changing tapestry as the vivid characters reborn from the first 2 volumes devolve into reverse images of themselves: good to evil, evil to good. The final outcome rests with the reader's own imagination. Breath taking imagery, very fast paced plot. Perfect."
3,Troy Game Rocks!!!!!!,"I am writing this review to said something about this series. I am currently only on book 2 of the Troy Game and I am almost 1/4 of the way through it. I am awaiting the chance to read Darkwitch Rising and when I get done reading it, then I will write a accurate review. I am mainly writing this review to put those people who believed this trilogy end with Darkwitch Rising. Unfortunately, they it still one more book left in the Troy Game series. The book is called Druids' Swords and it will start in the time period between 1939-1942. To find out more about this series, go to (...) to find out more."
4,"good product, fast shipping, good price",I got this for my boyfriend for a Christmas present.He seems to like it and will use it a lot during hunting season.It is a good value being a 10x42 and the comfort grips are 'comfortable'
3,Adaquate product but too flexible,"The ladder is very light and portable. Watch out for the oil or grease when you extend it. About the only drawback to this ladder is its flexibility and tendancy to shake. When fully extended, it bends alarmingly as you climb it. I'm no where close to 300 lbs but if I climb at any normal angle to a wall, it feels like the ladder is going to collapse and It loses probably about a foot of length due to the bending. Also, watch out for the two metal tabs underneath each step. You'll want to carefully inspect each one to make sure it's fully extended. Otherwise, you will have a step which collapses as you climb and put your weight on it."
1,Dissapointed,"I was very disappointed with this product. I bought this for my father, and it turned out to be a chore. The item banged against the window and was very distracting when driving, and was too much of a hassle to take on and off to avoid the distraction."
3,Car Caddie - Soft Grip Support Handle,Grip Support is OK but it was designed for ones who can get out of the car very easy on their own. Will not support more than 200 lbs. Also puts a lot of stress on the door on a small vehical
5,car caddie,This item has been a tremendous help in assisting my mom getting in and out of the car due to her age and loss of one leg. I am so happy I purchased this item and can use it for future use. The item is good quality and very easy to use as shown in the picture.
5,"Great for trucks, forget about the window, use overhead handles","My Grandmother is 5 foor nothing. she has to use an additional step stool to climb in and out of any tall vehicle. This Helping Hand attached to the over the door and frame handles are perfect. We even attached one to the handrail by our camper door to assist her to the first step.Elderly aside, these are great for any short/small person."
4,thumbs up.,"it is a good dvd, i also have the from a to zoe set. zoe jakes is a really good dancer. thumbs up."
2,I wish I had saved my money,I was very disappointed with the camera anglesShe made mistakes and laughed and went onI would think another take would be the professional way to goI thought she spoke to fastI think she forgot she was making this DVD for us her customerviewing at homeI really didn't care for the part where she had her classI thought hey who cares I bought this DVD for meall in all I thought the dvd was poor it was annoying to watch the first timeI tried for a second time but got ticked and out came the dvdback in the case and no desire to watch it again...I am so sorry I wasted my money on this...I don't care who it is I don't care who you are and I'm not interested in cutsie cutsie all I want is a solid dvd with good info I want what I paid for...I don't think she's a good teacher sorry great dancer yes I agreeI would never buy another dvd done by her sorry impress me the first time
4,grows on you,"I do agree with some of the reviews that the angles are quite strange but I've used the dvd loads of times now and am really feeling the benefits. My advice is try and get past the strange angles and stick with the dvd, Zoe is a great teacher and the dvd will grow on you, it delivers on its promise the drills are great, well worth the purchase however not for beginners."
4,Drills drills and more drills,"The video delivered what it said it would - sans frills and thrills. Zoe earns her reputation as a great teacher as she pushes you to drill both slow and fast, and downloads a great deal of information for you to take to your practice.If you want to establish a good solid drilling regiment and improve your dance skills, this is the dvd for you. If you want choreographies and cute combos, not so much."
3,I love this CD.,One of the two CD cases arrived damaged although the exterior packaging was intact. The music itself is great.
5,Excellent transfer media between laptop and desktop.,"Transferring large files such as multimedia presentations back and forth between a laptop and a desktop is a common chore for me, and one that has never been easy. The methods I have used include: 1)a laplink-type setup which involves plugging in cables behind inacessible computers and finding someplace to balance the laptop during the transfer 2) Burning a CD which is slow and requires CD-RW on both systems 3) A USB zip - 100 drive that can be plugged into either machine, but is too fragile and bulky to carry around.The Clik! (PocketZip) is both handy and easy to setup. I leave the PC-card it in the laptop where it functions as a backup drive for documents, and can easily be removed to transfer files via the dock between systems. Although I have large multi-media files, it is rare that they exceed the 40 MB disk capacity. I think it is an excellent solution, although I cannot yet vouch for the durability of the media."
5,A Must Read for anyone interested in the Dog Face!,"I have yet to find a better book on the experiences of the average ""dog face"" in WWII. From North Africa to Sicily to Italy to France; Ernie was there and covered it better than anyone."
5,extraordinary,"I'm amazed that anyone could dislike this book. I thought it was extraordinary. The author moves around in time between different related characters, and the transitions are never jarring. I especially liked the Bar Mitzvah twin letters and the last chapter of the book. What a brilliant writer! I look forward to reading her other book."
3,Ambitious but does not entirely work,"This is a very ambitious novel in which Horn attempts to use mystical images and thought to connect two separate times and plot lines. Remarkably, she deliberately does not push the plot to its conclusion, but instead devotes her final chapter to elaboration of the mystical thought.Unfortunately, I thought Horn got too literal and specific in the final chapter and it did not work. The highlight of the novel for me was the love affair between Ben and Erica, two very likable and well developed characters. The love scene in the darkened cellar of the museum was beautiful and erotically charged."
1,Terrible! Leaden characters and dialogue falls flat.,"I bought this book becuase of the intriguing plot...and becuase I had attended the Chagall show at the Jewish Museum where the paiting was actually stolen from, giving Horn the idea for the book. Unfortunately the characters are lead weights with wooden dialogue and frankly not very believable actions....If you are looking for a book that truly develops strangeness and other-wordly feelings, then readThe Stolen Child. That is one book I couldn't put down."
2,Not Happy,Not happy with the book. It was a little confusing. Not as interesting as All Other Nights.
2,Disappointed,"I found this book disjointed and not easy to follow. I am an avid reader and heard such great reviews of this book but it really doesn't warrant such glowing reports, sorry to say. The characters were not well developed and the story line so convoluted as to not make sense."
1,Disappointed,"The author is clearly a very intelligent and knowledgeable person but I could not sink my teeth into this book. I found it confusing, too complicated and not ""enjoyable"" reading."
3,"Author 5*, reader 5*, CD zero","Despite failing eyesight, once I started to read this book, I was so enthralled I kept going. I ordered several copies for my Book Club, and indulged myself with the CD. The reading is excellent. But even for those with 20/20 vision, the discs are not only hard to read, but hard to handle. A flimsy pocket of clear plastic holds a silver disc with small numbers, hard to see on the shiny silver surface. Presumably the market for CDs is made up largely of people with poor eyesight, like me. I suggest the CDs of Doris Kearns Goodwin's TEAM OF RIVALS as a model of an excellent CD -- white print on a matte black surface. with the disc number large and clear at the top. And firm pockets, easy to see and use."
5,A Well-Loved Book on All Accounts,"I purchased this book on a whim, simply because of the cover. I quickly found it was something much deeper than a typical novel. The extent to which Horn could not only tell many interesting stories and weave them into one while still sending a profound message is beyond what I have read before. I'm not a religious person, so in terms of the messages of God, this did not hit home, but the ideas of who we are, the relationships we carry, and how we can be good people won't escape even the most anti-religious. There's a little romance, a little tragedy, a little comedy, and a little of everything else that makes a great read. The story almost feels like it reads itself. The disjointed pieces fall into place slowly, but not without reward. I highly recommend this novel to anyone."
2,Fortunes,"I didn't care for the book that much, but that could of been because I thought that the book had to do with the family of Fortunes from Texas and I was shocked to find out that it was Minneapolis. That kind of threw me off. Jessica trying to find a family member that could help save her daughter's life from family members that don't even know that she ever exsisted. She in the process found someone who believed her and was willing to help her out to get the family to understand."
4,Outboard Engine Manual,This book has aided me in doing several maintenance and repair tasks on my Yamaha engines. I have already saved over $300.
3,It's just OK,"I must admit that I was a little disappointed with this book. I was looking for a general book that would cover older outboards in some detail - this isn't it. In its favor, it has a lot of ""how things work"" in it and, for a beginner, would be a decent book. But I truly wish it had more about the older motors like the one I have."
2,Celestron Traveler 8-24X25 Compact Water Resistant Zoom,"DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM CELESTRON.I made a mistake thinking I got a deal, after getting problems adjusting the lens to compensate for my near sightedness, I had to spend the $$$ to buy a NIKON 8x WATERPROOF binoculars for my trip to Alaska. The Nikon did a MUCH better than job, furthermore the return policy with Celestron pretty much tells you what they think of their product, (WORTHLESS)Any company willing to make you pay a high premium to return their defective product for service is telling you the REAL worth of the product you purchase. If you cannot buy a NIKON, get a VIVITAR.My opinion, stick to binoculars with FIXED magnifications. 8x and a pair of 16x should be all the binoculars you will ever need."
4,Very good,Received these as a gift for the times I need binoculars. Trips and ordinary use. Great value. Sturdy. Strap is thin but that is not significant to me.
4,As requested,"I have not field tested these binoculars yet, but have viewed the neighborhood and they appear adequate. I will certainly use them on my travels in Israel this Spring."
4,Worked fine,"This bit is more expensive than the Magnate brand equivalent. It comes in a little more expensive looking hard plastic individual bit case. I routed several hundred feet of 1-1/8"" thick exterior grade plywood 5/8"" deep with this bit for inlaying 1/2"" Pex-Al-Pex tubing. It worked as expected."
1,bad,How do people even think of making such horrible films?1st of all you lose the plot the second the beginning credits end2nd of all the acting is terrible3rd of all these movie is horrible
2,"This ""Godfather"" should be ""Wacked""!","Those of you bad pimpin', jive rat soup eatin' MF's will surely be disapointed in this DVD. The movie is a boring anti-drug preach-a-thon, with terrible moog music background noise. Brother Rudy stars as a Disco DJ, who's nephew gets hooked on angeldust, and OD's, so ""Buck""(Rudy's character), avenges his nephew's death by taking on those who supply the dreaded drug! The movie only get's somewhat interesting in the last few scenes. Stay with the greats, ""Dolemite"", ""Dolemite II"", and ""The Devil's Son-In-Law"", If you lookin' to get your Rudy Ray Moore fix! as for this DVD, Let it sleep with the fishes!"
1,"So Bad, It's HILARIOUS!","This movie IS for those of us who love to laugh...and OMG, this is one big, unintentional laughfest. I'm so glad this one is available on DVD. One line in particular still gets my girlfriends and me giggling: ""We've got to Whack the Attack!"" This is one example of one truly low-budget flick. And power to it! Attack the Whack or Whack the Attack...either way, this is one film that belongs in your cult movie collection. Put it next toI'm Gonna Git You Suckaand you've got a fab double-feature blaxploitation extravaganza."
2,"Boring. Predictable, Low Budget",Save your money. Not worth owning. This one has a dull plot. Very predictable. This silly man in a chicken suit keeps repeating. Very low budget. Rent it instead.
1,Don't put your weight on it!,"First off, Rudy Ray Moore is not Dolemite in this so called third installment of the series. He plays an ex-cop turned DJ and Dancer named Tucker. Secondly, this movie has very little comedy and action both of which made Moore famous in Dolemite and Human Tornado. The most important thing about this you should know is that it seems to be one big repetitive mess based on ""Angel Dust"" and its terrorizing effects on the human brain. There are far too many scenes of hallucinating and the synthesized background music is almost nauseating. All in all the film is a waste of time and shouldnt be mistaken as part of the Dolemite series. Oh and by the way, Don Johnson and Madonna are not in this movie."
5,This movie made me an offer I couldn't refuse!,I was riveted to my seat. Non-stop action. Rudy Ray Moore is a genius. His on-screen chemistry with Eddie Murphy was electric. The cameos by Madonna and Don Johnson were a nice surprise. It was a shame that nuclear blast killed everybody at the end. Buy this movie on video or DVD today!
3,What has he had?,"Ok, it's been years since I have seen this (probably 15) but it made such an impact on me that I'm buying it on DVD damnit!For all out laugh value, you could do much worse. The scary thing is that they are trying to be serious.Not to ruin anything, but the ending of this movie tweeked me out so hard that I'm still feeling it. You were thinking ""Well maybe the godfather sacrificed himself for the good of the community and so that the next generation will be spared the scourges of PCP.""Or:Disco godfather wakes up with a ""Whew! That was a close one, angel dust almost claimed me, but my strong will and clarity of righteous purpose helped me previal.""BUT NO!!! Godfather goes crappin' his pants crazy seeing the ""PCP angel/devil"" and whimpering ""ma ma"" then right out of a Steve Ditko comic: ""NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!""AND THATS IT!HOLY CRAP!"
5,Classic!,This movie is crazy funny... a true classic of it's genre. You won't be disappointed if you watch it with an open mind and snifter full of courvoisier!
4,2010 Atlanta Falcons,This DVD Set includesWeek 3 At New Orleans: Atlanta 27 New Orleans 24Week 9 vs Tampa Bay: Atlanta 27 Tampa Bay 21Week 10 vs Baltimore: Atlanta 26 Baltimore 21
5,just what i wanted,"great quality, fast service. the games truly were the best choices for best games of the falcons. The service was fast and i received them on time."
4,Great book,"My husband and I read this book after our Dr. advised me to start low impact exercising to help manage Lower back pains. Worked out for us. It also helped me feel better about my body, and helped us bond."
3,"I own few romance, but I kept this one","It's been a while since I read this book. I kept it because of a funny scene that nearly made me wet my pants laughing, which is a good thing. However, the writing of the times it was written is not up to par for today's reader. It's wordy and slow-paced at times, has stilted dialogue, some awkward sentences, self-description, lame and unrealistic love scenes, and the hero many times sounded like a woman by his word choice. If it weren't for the castor oil scene (I believe it was castor oil), I wouldn't waste my shelve space. What do you expect from a story written in 1988. :D"
4,"I found this book fascinating, but disturbing","I was intrigued by the title of this book as I had lived in Saudi Arabia and been out to rig sites in the Rub Al Khali (the empty quarter). The characters in the book seem very real, if not very likeable. The characterization of the TCN's rang true. The American's came across poorly, but perhaps that too was true. I found the harshness of rig life and the undercurrent of violence to conflict with my exposure to this enviornment, however I will admit to limited knowledge. The writing made you care about the characters and read on. I found the character of Strong to be almost a caricature, drillers normally are party on types but have a great deal more self-control, professionalism, and discipline by the very nature of their work. The technical details were woven into the story in such a way as to make the rig and the well almost characters of their own. On the whole well written, it made me want to visit Hofuf again!"
4,The Empty Quarter,"I sent for this book because I liked the writer's other book, ""Not Between Brothers"".It is very gripping and even though it was writen ten or so years ago I found it enlightening about oil exploration. In light of the recent trouble in the Gulf of Mexico it was especially interesting.Well writen. Wish the writer would do more books."
5,let's say grace,"We have always said grace before our meals, but recently, when friends were over, we used the book. they say grace only on special holidays, but after hearing the prayer that evening, her son and daughter both asked for this book and want to use it every night. I'm purchasing several to give to newlyweds, new parents. One usually takes a gift, why not this book?"
2,Not so great,I thought this would solve my problem for making fried chicken. It just takes more flour than using a bag or another container without the sifter thing.
3,Nice size to have for variety cookout items,"Nice size to have for variety cookout items to meet almost anything.Fish fillets, chicken with rib, and even big turkey legs.You would think Ziplock would have one on the shelf cheaper by now."
5,Great!,Very handy and love the large size! It took me a long time to find one that was large enough to occomodate the amounts that we do at one time for a group. Works great!
1,do not order,"top would not stay closed when trying to shake the batter...junk, don't get it...there has got to be better products on the market."
1,Flour shower,"I'm writing this as I take a break before I clean up the flour that is now coating me, my kitchen and even my dogs. I bought this and the Batter Pro at the same time since I couldn't decide which one I'd like better. For making breaded chicken wings I used this for the flour step and the Batter Pro for the bread crumbs. No matter how hard I tried to close it the Cook's Choice breader leaked flour all over. The Batter Pro was nice and easy to use and not a crumb out of place. Plus you actually get 2 breaders when you buy the Batter Pro. Don't waste your money-just buy the Batter Pro or use a plastic bag."
5,Best Fish breader ever,I have been a diehard fisherman for over 30 years. Getting an even breading on fillets has been a problem for many years. Last year my fishing partner received the better batter as gift for all the neighborhood fish fries he had put on. It produces perfect breaded fillets very fast with little waste of the breading. Other friends used mine and want one for them selves. The cover can be a problem if one doesn't pay close attention to that it is snapped shut before you start
5,I LOVE IT!!,"My husband loves this breader! We bought one for his dad also! We previously used gallon baggies, now we don't have to waste them!! The breader is a little large, and my husband wishes it was a little smaller.This breader also cleans in the dishwasher nicely (my favorite part).We bread mostly bonless fish filets, we have not tried anything else yet. We have not had any problems with the flour leaking.Overall, a great product!!"
4,It works,"As others have mentioned, the lid is somewhat difficult to snap on securely. After I get the lid on tight the product works as advertised. What works for me is getting on it securely on one end then I run my fingers along the edge to the opposite end till it snaps in place. I like the size which enables the breading of many portions. I use it for chicken and fish.The long oval shape is perfect for fish! I also like the indentations on the ends to grip while shaking or flipping to coat the contents. This gives the container a comfortable, secure feel. The lid issue prevents me from rating this 5 stars."
2,Looks nice but...,"It makes tea and will certainly produce a crop of questions along the lines of ""What on earth is that"" It has, however, a number of drawbacks. First and most serious, the tea becomes cold very quickly since the teabowl has no insulation. Secondly, the strainer must be physically removed from the pot to stop the infusion. Since the strainer is then full of wet tea leaves these tend to drip causing a mess. In addition, the tea strainer cannot be removed by hand if the tea is hot. This means that either a spoon or some other utensil must be used to remove the strainer, not as easy as it seems.I can't recommend this item."
3,so human an animal,"I have read this book because it was mentioned by Lovelock as shaping his ideas for the Gaia theory.In reading it I have found several interesting ideas and worthwile one- liners but I it took some trouble to remain reading because the tone and phrasing seemed to come from another era. However, when placed in the appropriate historical context it is worthwile.Persons interested in the future of the earth and the role of mankind in it must have had this on their reading list together with the books of Hardin."
3,"news so old, more trees could've been saved","the biggest thing to remember is that the book is written in 1968, and it well supported Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring"" (1970) to a T. today. Dubos makes his points well, tho spends about half a chapter to illustrate the evidence, i feel such explanations are not always needed. almost feels like he's writing to an audience of complete non-believers; as a geographer i find it dummyfying.still not a total failure for human geographists of 2005, there are some interesting tid-bits. Some high points are why there are different races (previously mentioned by National Geographic founder in 1899 in his observations of Alaskans), and why Southeast Asians are so short and Norwegians so tall, and how archetecture affects human life and well being. Also, the significance of human life chapter is interesting (if you havent found it yet, look at any self-help book).if you're really interested, concentrate on beginnings of paragraphs and last few pages of each chapter."
1,Wrong Edition,"I am supposed to get 16th edition, instead I received 15th edition. The book was completely changed from the previuos edition"
3,Only for oil CANDLES,"It's fine for round-wick oil candles, it's smokeless in those, yes. But you don't want to use this in a flat-wick lamp or lantern, it WILL clog the wick and cause it to lose brightness and start smoking badly. You want to use the Medallion oil by the same company (not odorless) or Kleen Heat (odorless) for that sort of wick."
2,NOT odorless! This stuff stinks!,"I purchased this oil specifically because of the reviews which indicated that it is odorless and smokeless (it's not). We wanted it to use in our oil lamps for power outages, etc.We recently tried to use our lamps with this oil during an outage, and I must say that whoever thinks this stuff is odorless must not have a very sensitive sense of smell. I was able to smell it right away and it was foul. I asked both my husband and daughter (as I tend to be more sensitive then they are to smells) and they both agreed that it does indeed give of an odor that was not pleasant. I ended up having to blow them out and use our candle lanterns & flashlights instead (They do not give off any odor what-so-ever!)If you have a sensitive sense of smell don't buy this - go for candles or propane lamps instead."
5,perfect cream for over dry skin and exzema,"I have very dry skin and exzema...but when i was reading the reviews, i decided to give it a try...and to my surprising, it is everything they say it would do..amazing my skin is not dry anymore and its softer and more smoother my exzema is much better now..i dont regret buying and i will continue to order it..its worth every penny..."
1,unhappy,"wasnt what i expected had 1 of the songs i wanted and expected, paid way to much for a copy not even a real copy looks like it was burned at home"
3,Disease Reprieve,"I beleive the information in this book is based on sound research and I applaude Dr. McDaniel for his work. However,in my opinion, the book is written in language suitable only for other physicians or persons with a background of biochemistry. I was hoping that I, as a lay-person with interest in this field, could have learned more about what I could do personally to help myself avoid cardiovascular disease. I expected more ""How To"" information and was a bit dissapointed in that respect. The only thing I learned from the book was to not eat processed foods high in sodium and to drink more pure non-mineral water but not water that has been processed by a water softener. I will try to struggle through the rest of the material again but it is probably too technical for me or most readers, especially if they are already starting into their ""Golden Years""."
5,Quality,This product is of great quality and works perfectly. It's a beautiful addition to any candle lovers collection. It is a very good deal.
4,Well worth it,"They are nice enough to be left out. Though not elaborate, they are charming and well worth the price. Everything else I have seen is much more and not as nice. Also the delivery was quicker then expected."
3,Bowl is great. Wooden Servers are poorly made.,Bowl arrived in good condition and is lovely. Does not really have room for making a salad for more than 4 people. The wooden servers are very poorly made. Mine arrived with the paint chipped and the holly decals on the handles were not properly attached with part of one decal missing.
5,Great item,It is worth buying. Excellent quality! It has very good steel and the set is very convenient.It was delivered fast.I am very pleased with it.
2,"There are okay, I use my old set more.","I bought these because I could not find my tablespoon, I don't like that they do not come apart, or if they do, it's not easy to get them apart. I find I use my old set more because they are tupperware and a lot easier to use."
5,Great Measuring Spoon Set,Great measuring spoon set and I use them almost daily. The set is durable and just what I was looking for.
4,Sturdy and nice looking,"These are the nicest measuring spoons I've ever owned. They feel heavy in your hand. Made of thick stainless steel. Long handles to reach into the bottom of a jar easily.I knock off one star because the labels are printed instead of engraved. The spoons will last forever, but the ink will wear over time and I'll be relying on my estimate to tell the difference between a teaspoon and a half-tablespoon. They went to the trouble of using this much good steel to make these, seems a shame to shorten the life of the tool with a label that will wear off."
4,Superb quality!,"I love the weight of these spoons, you know that is some good, sturdy metal they are made of by how freaking heavy the set is! The spoons also nest very nicely and are just plain gorgeous to look at. The only reason for four stars instead of five is that I wish the measurements were engraved into the metal or raised. The measurements are either painted on or engraved extremely, extremely shallowly, I can't quite tell. I got these to replace my ugly plastic measuring spoons whose measurements had disappeared over time because they were only painted on, not raised or engraved. It was no fun guessing the measurement of each spoon! Hopefully the measurement markers on these measuring spoons last, though judging by the great quality of the spoons overall, maybe they will prove my fears wrong!"
5,LOVE these!,"I just got these today - they're BEAUTIFUL! Haven't used them yet, but they feel nice and heavy; they seem sturdy and very high quality. I ordered them from a different seller, so I can't comment on this seller, but the product is great. Would definitely reommend."
5,Perfect!,"you could not ask for better looking measuring spoons. I've had these for over a year now, and they still look brand new even though they get used nearly every day. No signs of wear, AND the measurements have not rubbed off at all! Very glad I purchased!"
4,Feel solid in your hand but have a tendency to separate from the holder,"I really like these spoons, which I upgraded to after an embarrassing number of years with the white plastic ones that I got in some set when we first got married. They have some heft to them and feel good in your hand, and the measurements are engraved in the handles so no worries that they will wear off. There is a 1/8 tsp. and 1/2 Tbsp which not all sets have.My only minor gripe that takes them down a star is that they come off of the loop when I don't want them to. I like that they can be removed so you don't have to wash and dry them all when you have only used one, but I also want them to stay together when I am not using them. These will last decades, as long as I don't lose one!"
5,Excellent quality,"First criterion was finding a measuring spoon set made of good quality. Second, I went in search of ""six in a set."" I visited many stores with no luck. As a matter of fact, most of the spoons I found were plastic and were of no use since I do not always measure cold ingredients. Also, when I visited stores I found that the quality of metal was cheap and often times, a film came off the spoons - imagine that film melting coming off in ones food - unacceptable. How silly of me not to search Amazon.com since I've had good luck in the past. The quality of the metal in the CIA Masters Collection is exceptional. The set is attractive, the handles are long and easy to read."
5,Very satisfied,"I love this spoon set. It is beautiful, sturdy and most importantly, I love using them! Haven't needed to dig them into spice jars so the round opening is good enough for me."
5,lifetime measuring cups,"I am happy to say that any concerns I had with these after reading and considering the few negative reviews, that I have no problems with these measuring cups. I was concerned that the handle, which appeares thin, would be uncomfortable to grip and that it could bend. It is very comfortable to hold, and it will not bend or break. Very durable. I had a different set that had a thin handle from Giada's line and the handle does bend. With these cups, it looks thin but is so durable and strong. No Bending. Also, it do not feel the handle is so thin that is could cut my hand. All in all the grip is comfortable. These are quality measuring cups and I can't see needing to replace them ever."
5,Expensive but well worth it,"What can I say, works as intended. Made with solid materials; should last a lifetime or more. A bit expensive, but well worth it. No more plastic spoons for me :)"
4,Beautiful spoons,"These spoons will be the last you will ever buy. They're heavy, well made and attractive.A lot of people write about liking the long handles. I'm not one of them. They're a little too long for my taste.Aside from that one thing, you can't do any better than these when it comes to stainless measuring spoons. This is one of the few metal sets you will find that has all of the normal sizes including the 1/8. It is truly a complete set. I understand this company also makes an odd size set with a 2/3 and 3/4 tsp as well.Well worth the money."
1,"The Diary of Anne Frank,","This is not the Diary of Anne Frank per sue, it is a book written like a play.I did not like this book. Sellers shipped immed. and I would buy from again."
3,"Critical Edition, Diary of Anne Frank","The book condition itself was posted as very good I believe. It was not. It had scrubbed mold/mildew marks and was missing the jacket. Pages were not in the best shape either. This was a great disappointment.As for reading the book, there are 3 different version of the diary and they are very hard to read. All three are on the same page. I had great hopes for this and they got dashed."
4,The tragedy of Anne Frank,"Born on June 12, 1929 in Frankfort on the main, Germany (now west Germany) Anne Frank died in March 1945. Although she did not live to see it. Anne frank did accomplish her dream of being a succesful writer, her diary gave us an in depth and ever so interesting account of life for a Jewish family in hiding during the Nazi Revoulution. Even a fiction tale could never be as interesting as the diary of Anne Frank."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I have owned this for a year, and it contributes more electronic noise than anything else in my entire signal chain..even more than my guitar amp! What electronic junk..They must have made their reputation on a lot better piece of gear than this, because if you have a decent sound in the first place, this will be a *huge* disappointment to you.This is the first piece of gear that you could throw overboard, and never miss it..ever. After an entire year, I still cannot say that this cheesey box has contributed anything at all to my music production..money better spend on something that actually delivers.I learned this one the hard way..when the product website doesn't have any samples of the before and after sound, then you can be sure that the company is wanting you to buy the story, not the sound.. If it actually sounded good, they would let you have a listen. What a total waste of time and money."
1,Hot liquids only,"I ordered this because of the fabulous reviews but the specs for the mug don't mention that the opening in the top is a hair over an inch wide, i.e. that the big wide black top you see in the picture doesn't come off to clean it....only a smaller inner core of that top. Just discovered that when it came in the mail today. You just keep twisting the opening for drinking further to open and remove the inner cap revealing the tiny opening. I had wanted to use it for cold drinks, putting ice in to chill them initially. Even a small cocktail ice cube doesn't fit in the top. What're you supposed to do, leave the mug in the freezer before every time you want to use it? Even if you use it for coffee, it will be wretched to try to clean. You can't get a cloth/sponge in easily to clean the sides and bottom and the shape prevents your even reaching the sides easily...and I have small hands/fingers. It's going right back tomorrow."
4,Thermos Travel Tumbler,"Great thermos cup. Great quality that has a good vacuum and keeps cold items cold and hot items hot. The top screws on either partially(for drinking) or fully to seal completely. A really nice feature is that to drink from it when closed, just unscrew it a half of a turn to drink. Then when done close that 1/2 turn and it is closed and completely leak free.ConsOpening is too small to put anything but small ice cubes in one at a time. We now tend to use it for hot drinks only. We bought another one for cold drinks that has a larger opening.Keep your eys on the bottom rubber seal (There are 2 on the cup) while cleaning, it can come off and if it does the top leaks, even when closed leaks."
4,"Element 5 tumbler, the best yet!","This is the best Thermos product that I have tried. I have tried a couple of other tumblers produced by Thermos that I thought were good, but this one puts them to shame. Coffee stays hot for long periods and if you are not careful and forget a couple hours latter, you might burn your tongue. I recommended this tumbler to a friend and he has burned his tongue a few times when he forgot that this was not his old mug. The only down side to this tumbler is the small opening. You need to put your condiments in first before pouring the coffee in. There is no room to use a spoon to stir your coffee! All in all, this is a good coffee tumbler."
3,"It works fine, but there are better options for most of us.","This was well-priced and I read another review saying something about keeping food in it. It's a coffee cup, really. It's not ideal for food, and it's pretty small. I will keep it, but it's not something I would use. The top is not comfortable to drink from, and there is not an additional cup with it.Pros:It's a Thermos. It will keep your drinks hot or cold.The bottom is rubbery and would bounce on the groud if you dropped it.It's not glass inside.It has a clip on the side so you can clip it to stuffCons:It is small.This wasn't what I needed, but I got back on Amazon and ordered another one that is for food. Thankfully, Amazon has a lot of great options..."
2,Two Stars for Customer Service,"The first one I bought started leaking within a week. A free replacement (with free shipping, too) started leaking too after a mere month of use.So I went to the drugstore and bought a $1.99 no-name thermos and have been using it ever since.This 'leak proof' thermos gets 0 stars, but I award 2 stars based on their returns/customer service people who were very nice."
4,good,"easy to clean and sturdy. It's a simple design and does the job well. The opening isn't large, so cleaning is not simple."
3,durability,"i use this product for three months and the bottom fell off,the thing looks neat and everything but it did not live up to the praises given by the manufacturer.It was sitting in my cupboard since the bottom fell off.am not satisfy at all and i think that i should be refunded or they should replace it."
2,Good while it lasted,"One day at work on a construction site, I put this in the front pocket of my hoody, and about 15 seconds later my sweatshirt became soaked with (really) hot coffee. I used this for about two weeks before the seal broke and it worked very well. Awesome insulating capacity and my coffee would stay hot from the early morning till the early afternoon. Also easy to sip. Thermos sent a replacement gasket, but it didn't resolve the issue. Must be some quality control problem where the cap no longer sits perfectly snug onto the container itself. Go for the contigo double walled containers, they insulate almost as well, but function and look much better."
2,Thermos 16 Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Tumbler,"I've been using this daily for a couple weeks now. It is built solidly. But for a thermos designed so ruggedly, they should have included a cap to keep the portion of the lid where your lips touch cleaner.The carabiner is worthless. it gave out on the first use and the thermos crashed to the concrete leaving the lid damaged.Lastly, heat retention is marginal, at best."
5,Works exactly as I hope it would,"Love this tumbler! I fill my tumbler with coffee every morning and place it in my bag for my morning commute which consists of walking (sometimes running if I'm late) to the subway station and taking the subway. It has not shown any sign of leakage whatsoever. The coffee stays warm for about 6 hours. When at work, I just drink my coffee straight from the tumbler because the cap controls the flow. Highly recommended."
4,Nice!,"Nice insulated tumbler! The top is NOT insulated, so my coffee doesn't stay hot as long as I wish it did, but it will stay hot for several hours and it is truly leak proof. I can put it in my panniers or a dufflebage with no fear of bad outcomes. It works well for that second cup of coffee later in the day so I don't have to drink the swill offered at work! It is now part of my daily equipment."
5,Heavy duty and hot!,"Built like a tank.After running hot water in it to heat it up, my coffee stays hot-hot for at least 3 hours.Even after 6 hours it is very warm."
3,good and bad,"This mug is good. This mug is not so good. First the good: Keeps liquids hot, warm, cold and cool for long periods of time(even when in my work pouch in the sun). Very durable and cleans up well. Does not leak. Handle hooks over things conveniently. Now the bad: Because the openings of the lid are slits that lead to the mug itself, all sorts of debris, dust, etc get into those slits and then into the actual threaded(screw) area so that when you go to take a sip you will also get all that debris, dust, etc.(If you use it in clean areas only, no problem). The shape, as commented on by others does not fit in car cup holders(drag) and the small opening allows you to only use a glassware brush for interior cleaning(or a dishwasher I suppose). I need to get another type of mug in addition to this one for my needs."
4,Great product - and FITS in my truck's awful cupholder,"I've had this Thermos tumbler for a couple of months now. Would give it five stars except I'm not crazy about the narrow neck opening when the lid is off.That being said - I think it's a fantastic product. Totally leak proof and easy to drink from. Keeps stuff hot for a long time. Great to clip on backpack or briefcase handle, or sometimes I just toss it in a bag with no leak problems. Fantastic.An added bonus: contrary to what many others have reported, this thing fits PERFECTLY in the cup holders in my car's stock cupholders! My Ford Explorer (2002 XLT) has horrible cup holders and I had given up finding something that would fit well.I chose this Thermos tumbler based on other reviews about its other features and durability. I was pleasantly surprised to find it fit snugly in the stock console spots. Nice!Probably won't work for everyone's car, but if you have a 2002 Explorer, I can tell you that this thing fits nice and snug.:)"
4,Solid Thermos,I use this thermos daily for my morning coffee. It keeps it hot at least until lunch (4 hours). I love the ability to drink from any direction. The down sides are that it is a little bulky for most cup holders and it doesn't perform well in sub-zero temps (but that is understandable). The metal outside gets too cold to touch and the contents stay hot for about an hour. Overall worth it for the price.
5,Best thremos on earth,"Ingenious. Now I can drink coffee in the car without the coffee going cold, and without coating the interior with it. I can totally lay this thing (full) on its side, even up-side-down without fear."
5,High Quality,This is a high quality Thermos product. The opening is a little small but the coffee stays hot and with a quarter turn is very easy to drink. If you need a to go cup this one is great.
5,Michael Hedges is an inspiration,"I remember the first time I saw and heard Michael Hedges. A friend of mine lent me a copy of a copy of the VHS ""Windham Hill.."", Michael blew me away. That was over ten years ago, and watching this on DVD really brings back that feeling of being blown away. It also reminds of how much was lost when he perished in an automobile accident. Yet, it keeps his spirit alive. I love playing this for friends that haven't heard Michael Hedges, and watching their jaws drop. I have to say the Hedges part of the DVD is 5 stars and then some. The rest of the DVD blows. It is the Hedges portion that is worth more than the price of admission."
3,A correction to the other review,"Actually, none of the songs on this album were written by Elvis Costello - they were for the most part written by Attractions keyboard player Steve Nieve who used the name Norman Brain. He wrote them in conjunction with his then wife Fay Hart, so the writing credit was Brain & Hart."
4,Hot and no drips!!,"I've been using my tumbler regularly for almost a year. It DOESN'T drip, and the sip opening is large enough to get a good swallow, but small enough to protect you and your car if you hit a bump. It also keeps the contents VERY hot for quite a while. The coffee stays hot for more than an hour (I'm a slow sipper).P.S. I recommend that you wash it by hand. I suspect that most problems with dripping come from washing it, or any of these products, in a dishwasher (the extended contact with very hot dishwasher water, the harsh detergents, and the very hot drying cycle will misshape the cap, causing a poor seal)."
5,Love it!,"We bought this desk years ago for my son's room and it is very sturdy and has held up well. The shelves hold A LOT of items, such as printers, pencil holders, decorations.... We use the area below the monitor for the keyboard, instead of the pull out drawer. This key board area is roomy (about 12"" deep), and might even accommodate a small lap top.The monitor area is best for a thin monitor, but will accommodate a small thick one. It (the monitor area) measures 12"" deep x 20 1/4"" wide x 19 1/2"" high. It is a great desk for the money.If you use the area we do for the keyboard, it allows plenty of room for a rolling chair under the desk. I also have room with the keyboard holder attached.Here is my update: Just ordered another one. Still like it a lot, but allow about 4 1/2 hours (maybe more) to put together."
2,"Great desk, bad service","Desk wasn't here on time, so I emailed CS. It apparently was damaged in shipping, so they sent it back to the manufacturer and sent me a new one. It was a little bit of a long wait. Roomate ordered the same desk 2 days after I ordered mine, and his got here in fair condition with a dent in the black finish and a bend in one of the legs, nothing serious though. Mine got here and had a chip in the black finish, but I covered it up with a cloth. Won't be ordering from Home and Living again unless they fix their shipping problems. Took a month to get the damaged desk, and that's just bad service.But the desk is great! Sturdy, sleek design, very nice looking."
5,The only one that didn't break!,"I ordered these guns as a prop in a community theater production. All my other swords and guns broke except for these, which is saying something since they were being used by teenagers! I ordered two, one works perfect, and the other gets stuck a little, but once you learned the ""trick"" to keeping it going, it was fine. They are fun, even the adults got into the sparking noise and little lights."
3,"Great prop, not so great for a toy","This gun is going to look great for my Leela costume! It will definitely do the job if you're just looking something to look cool at a party or in photos.On closer inspection, the gun doesn't appear to be very good quality. The plastic seems cheap and it also makes a loud clicking noise when the trigger is pulled. Sometimes the trigger doesn't catch properly, and you have to pull it a few times to make the sparks. It seems like the trigger has less problems when pointing the gun downwards. It just doesn't seem to be made well, so I wouldn't expect it to last very long if purchased for a child.It would be nice to be able to pick the color of the gun, but I'm satisfied with the red one I received."
2,Bit cheapo and not so great looking...,"This is OK as a tiny silly gadget that might entertain a little kid for a few minutes or if he is very imaginative in play. But to me it looked like a cheapo little toy you'd pick up at a street fair for 3 bucks. The plastic looked a little cheap and scratched up, but I think that's just the nature of the product. You could buy it as a stocking stuffer (tho a little large for that) or a party favor (tho a little pricey for that)... I was not so impressed and I was glad I had another (better) Christmas present to accompany it when I gave this to my nephew. Kinda cheap-seeming, to me, but it is what it is! Makes cool noise, sends off the color of sparks inside it. Kinda like a little plastic noisemaker toy."
4,"great sounds; bass, treble and range.","i got this headphone as a gift, couldn't be better, i'm an audiophile on my sleep :)this headphone delivers a good range for both bass and treble and the spectrum for both the clarity and its noise cancelling feature makes this a very good companion for travel or in my case for going to sleep. I like to listen to music before going to bed.The sounds it reproduces egreeses like a surround sound only its on duplex ('',)amazing, sometimes, it emersed my senses so much i forgot how loud my headphones had got that the noise cancelling feature cancels itself from its own sounds.Overall, Im so happy to have this as a gift. couldn't be better."
3,disappointment with product,"I purchased the steamer to make steamed custard pudding. However, there's no adjustment to the setting of the heat. So the pudding boiled over, and it was a mess. But the steamer cooked corn great."
3,Where is the recipe guide?,"I just bought this steamer and was going to use it only to discover that the use and care guide makes no mention of what foods cook what way and for how long! I can't get through to Balck and Decker to find out if it is supposed to come with it, but it is going to be very difficult to use without knowing how long to cook something. I hope this is an oversite from B & D. If not, reconsider buying it."
3,It's Getting Steamy in Here...,"What can I say about a steamer? The process is quite simple... heat water and add items above the water so to cook them without washing away the flavors and nutrients. Yes, a person can do this in many ways without spending money on yet another gadget but oh this gadget is worth paying for. I am giving this steamer a neutral rating because a: it is made in China. b: there is no recipe book for those of us who have never used a steamer before. c: this model is way way way too expensive for the lack of features. Does it do what it's supposed to? You bet it does. I've made perfect shrimp and corn on the cob. Would I buy it again for the price I paid? No. I would find a cheaper one somewhere. Do I regret buying this one? No. In summary, if you want a steamer that works but lacks some great features (like a water level meter) and don't mind paying for the convenience of free shipping you will be served well by this steamer."
5,I LOVE it...but,This product is fantastic. I am very glad I bought it. It works very well and is easy to use. We will definitely eat more veggies this way. But...don't expect to have any clue how long to cook anything. The guide inside says how to turn it on and where stuff goes but that is it. You will have to buy a cookbook to figure out how long anything should cook. And bookstores have not caught on to the steam craze so save yourself the lookign and buy one on Amazon.
5,Great Product,"I purchased the Black & Decker Flavor-Scenter Steamer Deluxe Food Steamer for myself, and I liked it SOOO much, that I bought this Double Decker Steamer for my sister. We try to eat healthy, and this has helped out a lot. It is easy to use and easy to clean....just throw it in the dishwasher."
3,Steamer review,"I am enjoying my steamer; however, I speculate that it does not work as well as the one I was given in 1977 as a wedding gift. It had just stopped working when I purchased this new one. Also, I am very disappointed that the appliance did not come with a small cook/recipe book like my previous one."
1,Leaves plastic taste in food,Bought this steamer based on all the rave reviews. What in the world? This steamer leaves a horrible plastic taste in everything I have cooked in it. I have tried it over and over again hoping the taste would go away but I have given up after many ruined meals. My hopefulness and persistence has taken me beyond the 30 day return policy so now I will just have to throw it away. I really can not understand how other reviewers have not experienced this problem.
2,Leaked; customer service is evil,"The steamer worked great at first, but then it started leaking copious amounts of water through an insecure seal at the bottom. Also the timer stopped working, and I had to set my own timer separately. Black & Decker had me snip off the power plug and return it, with $7.50, for a replacement. Weeks later, I received aBlack & Decker HS800 Flavor Scente Steamer, which is a cheaper and inferior model. I complained, and was told that, as far as they're concerned, they fulfilled their warranty obligation. I'm still arguing with them now, but they want me to mail back the HS800 at my own expense--again.This is a great product when it works, but I'm going to avoid buying Black & Decker from now on, just in case."
3,Black & Decker a disappointment,"The steamer does what the descriptions says, but it is about half the size my Oster steamer was. I am keeping this one because it is such a hassle to repackage it and ship it back - and I don't have a family. If I did, its capacity would not be good because it is SMALL. You won't be able to fit as many vegetables in each bowl. When I first took it out of the box, it looked like a toy compared to the one I had. It's hard to judge the size from the written description - at least it was for me. In the picture it looks about the same size as the Oster. I just want people to know it is small so they aren't shocked like I was!"
3,where were the directions??,"The steamer itself is great minus one thing....it did not come with the food instructions! This model should have came with a book telling you how long to steam what foods and how high to fill the water line up to. It is a good thing that my mom has the exact same steamer and hers came with a lovely guide telling her the time and water requirement for different foods, she copied it for me."
5,Super steamer,"We've had and used this steamer at least once every day for years. It has held up terrific and does a great job for steaming vegetables, cooking rice and other grains, and reheating leftovers. I love the double decker, for doing two at one time. We upgraded from another B&D steamer that we just plain wore out after many years of use."
5,Very convenient product!,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it very much. It's very convenient for lazy people who hates complicated cooking. You just need to add some water and set the time, then, wait. But be careful with the hot steam when you open the steamer after cooking!"
2,Its just hype. Do not waste your money.,"It does work, but it is stupid outdated appliance. It does not steam rice but boils it! It is replaced by a stove, crock pot and microwave. All easier and less mess. Save your hard earned money. I have had it for 20 years. We used all it's ""Deluxeness"". Then used it 5 more times, maybe we were missing something? NO. No offense to others who use it."
5,Bought as a Christmas gift,My daughter loves this steamer. I have one also and it's great! It's a multi-tasker and is easy to use.
4,Excellent,"More than met my expectations: a. Cleans easily; b. Inexpensive c. Prepares vegetables, chicken and fish to perfection.The heating element is coated with minerals after a week of usage. But going through a cycle with lemon water, cleans it easily."
3,Funny Taste?,"Perhaps I'm the only who's noticed this, but vegetables that I steam with this product, seem to have a funny taste. I confess, I only rinsed the product before I used it, so maybe washing it would've ensured that there was no taste. I have not yet tried to steam any meat."
2,I don't really like it,"This product was sent as a wedding gift. We had put another smaller steamer on our list, but I guess the relative thought bigger was better. Anyway, it didn't come with any instructions on how long to cook stuff so it's a guessing game. It is a bit of a pain to clean and takes up too much space in our apartment. I tried to cook rice in it and the rice was still hard after 30 minutes! If I just want to make 2 servings of vegetables it's just too long of a process. For me, it is just annoying to deal with. If you don't have much space and you're only cooking for 1 or 2 people then you should get a smaller steamer."
4,steamer really steams,"This steamer works great and is really convenient when you have multiple foods to steam (including foods that require different cooking times). The only drawback is that it comes with very limited instructions regarding cooking times, so you have to experiment at the beginning. I didn't plan to use it to make rice, but it does a nice job there too."
4,Nice Product,"This product works well for cooking veggies, fish, and even dumplings. The built in timer makes it really hassle free, and when it shuts off automatically, food will stay warm for quite a while. Most things take longer to cook than the packaging or recipes suggest, but that's my only complaint."
4,Nice machine,This machine is great. I like that you can steam multiple items and if you aren't steaming alot that you can remove one of the trays for room. The one thing I didn't like how easy the water/spice tray stained when I used a mix of spices. (I know it's white plastic and it can be expected). Otherwise a great product at a good price
4,Terrorism in our own backyard.,"What happens when the type of drug-related violence normally associated with Columbia, Mexico, etc. pops up in a major US city. The author thrills and scares us with this scenario. By viewing current conditions differently we are led to an outcome which horrifies us. Not only is it good reading it is very thought provoking."
3,Military thriller with a human face,"A Tom Clancy type thriller, with well-drawn characters. More a novel with a military setting than the typical overly-detailed descriptions of weapons you see in many novels of this type. Action! Guns! Sex! (just a little)What more do you want from a good read?"
2,Battle of Kursk,Only German tanks were reviewed and very little was said about Russian tanks that opposed them. The maps that were used were rather poor. The first map used was green in color and made it difficult to follow the location of both armies. The maps that followed were shifted in direction and the time on screen was short. I guess I am used to the maps used on the Battlefield videos that are excellent and these fall short. The tank battles that followed were short and lackingin detail.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this cd, prior to the track listing becoming available. I was hoping that it would contain the songs he recorded for other labels other than epic. IT did not. And the sound quality on the other available cd is much better, plus the other has more songs. Get Complete Epic recordings, not this one."
4,holds belts still,"I bought this thing a couple of years ago and never did a review. I was just going through my shipping reviews and this thing popped up. Not knowing that I did not do a review, I thought I would go back and correct a lousy one. Well I first thought it to be a piece of junk, but after using it for a couple of years, I have to say it's bullet proof. I have loads of belts on it and it works just fine. You really don't have to go and spend a fortune on a fancy wood holder with metal loops, this one is great."
3,For belts.,"I guess I have too many belts and once they're all hung, you can't really twirl the hanger like expected. It's still nice to have all my belts in one place and easy to see and find."
4,Great for Organizing!,"I didn't have anywhere to put all my belts, and this is the perfect solution. I like how it spins so you can see what you're looking for. The only thing is you have to evenly weigh out the sides so they don't slide off. Overall I like this product and would recommend to others."
2,cheap piece of crap,"It's as cheap as it looks. I got it for $2-something, adding it to get the $25 free shipping on my order. It's definately not worth $5+."
5,It works fine,"I have two tie holders that are similar to this. I haven't had any problems with those, but that's because ties are much lighter than belts. The problem with the belts tipping is due to the weight of the belts, through no fault of the holder. The hanger being in the center of the design actually lessons this problem in comparison to other designs. It works fine for me! If you want something nicer, spend more than $5."
5,"I did like it, daughter liked it more.","I bought this for myself, for MY belts.Well my daughter took one look at it and took it for herself giving me her metal ring belt holder.It is very easy to use, especially for children.A must have for any kids closet!!!"
1,Fatally flawed.,"Not worth the money.1. It doesn't hang well unless belts are loaded evenly all the way around. This makes it a pain to put/take belts on/off. Take a belt off one side, the whole thing tips and the belts fall off the other side.2. It only works with belts that have an open loop at one end. It won't work with typical men's dress belts that have a solid buckle with a small pin that hooks into belt holes.3. Once assembled, you can't take it apart to return it!"
2,Cheap!,"This product is VERY CHEAP! But, sort of still serves its purpose. I guess it's worth 3.00, but it will end up in a yard sale."
3,twril a belt,nice but for the price not worth it a piece of plastic should of got at least 2 or 3 they cant cost more then 5 cents to make
1,Look for something more sturdy.,"This is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" items. (And I think I still overpaid). I would expect to find an item like this in the dollar store for about $1...in fact, if you look, there is probably one there. More than that, I don't think I would waste my money. It is very cheap plastic...like what plastic hangers are made of. This will not hold a lot of heavy belts...I'm sure it would not withstand any amount of weight. I was hoping it would hold more belts, but is not working for what I intended. I will keep looking for a much sturdier item as this one definitely will not fit the bill."
2,Not worth 5 bucks!,This product is 2 flimsy peices of plastic that snap together -- certainly would not have spent more than 99 cents if I'd seen it up close!
2,Product is ok,"I was disappointed upon opening this package. I purchased this for my husband's belts however due to the very light weight and poor craftsmanship of this rack, his belts are not sitting very well."
5,the most beautiful song i have ever heard!,"i must point out that everyone should have this most beautiful song in their life somewhere "" just as long "" i mean sit right on down n get into this dynamite song, the words n everything about it is just breathtaking!!one of the very ,very best ballads ever made on this planet,i wish the group themselves,the 8th day,would just happen to read this or know somehow that their song, ""just as long"" should put them into the hall of fame for that song alone!! amen!!joey hoffman u s a !!!!"
3,The Baron's Booty,"The book is as good as I remember it. I'm sorry it went out of print. I bought this copy, especially, for a friend's granddaughter. It was a bit disconcerting when I discovered the copy I bought had, obviously, once been a library book. I had to explain the whole thing to my friend. Not that it alters the delightful story of the baron who abducts a group of mischievous girls, and quickly lives to regret it. But I wish I could have found a better copy."
5,Grab you're Dream Ticket for classic Elton John in concert!!!,"Simply awesome,three great concerts(on three DVD's),and a a 4th disc of Bonus Elton videos = 1 great deal!!! All for less than the price of a single concert ticket,and you get the best seat in the house!!! Great picture and sound quality!!! Rock on Elton!!! Two thumbs up!!! Way up!!! A+"
3,"Buy it for recent performances, not the early ones...","This is a revised review...My first one was pretty critical simply because I wanted the classic stuff and didn't get it, so I wanted to give you a more useful review now. Now that I watched the set again, I would recommend buying if you're a die-hard fan and/or you really like his performances in the 90's and beyond. It's pretty decent in that respect. If you're looking for 70's/80's footage w/his voice range as recorded - hitting the higher notes, it's simply not there. That was a huge let down for me. I thought that the 4th disc was supposed to be vintage but it contained very little. For the die-hards, I would say that it's good to have in your collection, just not what it should have been..."
5,Great sound...great 5.1 surround mix,"To prove my case just check the DVD that has the concert with the London Philarmonic Orchestra, now this is a great 5.1 surround mix, much better than many other DVD concerts I've heard. You can listen to the whole orchestra throughout your five speakers and subwoofer while Elton John's voice will come from the center one and the piano through your front speakers...this is an excellent DVD to show off your 5.1 System to friends. Just put ""Saturday Nights is alright for fighting"" and you'll hear what I am talking about...My complain with other 5.1 surround music DVDs is that you would only listen to your surround speakers at the end of songs with the audience' applause or if there is an extraneous sound but that's it.I won't comment about the content, many reviewers have covered that extensively. However, regarding audio sound..THUMBS UP for this one. BTW, the other DVDs 5.1 surround sound is awesome as well."
3,Defective DVD,"The 4th DVD is defective. It starts to play, and it plays for a little while but then all of a sudden, it goes back to the beginning of the DVD and starts to play the beginning all over again. Something is definitely wrong with this one particular DVD. Can it be replaced?"
5,Wonderful concert,"Elton john is amazing first concert at madison square garden was the best in my opinion at london it was also inspiring,i would have to say the one in turkey was ok but I wish he would have had his band members just me.all in all the dream ticket is a must for elton john fans you will not be disappointed!!"
1,"one star cause so much left out, one night only again????","First the quality is great. So go ahead and buy it, i did!I'm just so disapointed that it included the recently released best hits live from msg which any fan already bought!!!.The videos dvd is alwaysinterupted by talk. Why wasn't more material from the earlierconcerts included, %$&(&#@% lawyers??. Well cause most vhstapes of elton except the Barcelona Concert are such terrible quality they sell for $1 used.So basicly I paid lots of money for two great concerts andstuff I already had. Whomever put this set topgether should be fired."
3,"Good,but not great....","I'm a big EJ fan and was excited to hear that there was a 4 dvd box set of Elton coming out,but was disappointed to find out that the 4th disc didn't really have any rare clips of him from the 70's.There's a few though,but not enough.Like for Your Song for instance,it showed some early 70's performances,but then went into the early 80's and 90's..Why?? Why not show clips from that year and that's it??? Also,there was no costume gallery(if there was one,I couldn't find it!)either....Plus,the 1st disc is already out on dvd,so why have it in the set???? They should've had the following:To Russia from Elton,The Breaking Hearts tour(both volumes),the concert with the Australian Orchestra and the doc Elton John and Bernie Taupin Say Goodbye to Norman Jean and Other Things..Plus,have early tv appearances,too....We EJ fans demand more!!!!"
4,A must have,"This is a great package of Elton John live in three completely different settings. First a 'greatest hits live in New York' with various big shot guest performances, then a once in a lifetime gig with an impressive philharmonic orchestra and finally a rare piano only concert in the romantic setting of an historical open air theatre. A bonus DVD with some videos and interviews has been added covering 30 years of hitmaking. People nagging that they already have the New York Madison Square Garden concert on DVD are scrooges, but hey...Christmas time is coming up."
4,Cool,"Very cool, little cheap on the lid. I'd buy again no regrets. I can't believe it holds 51 ounces so nice."
3,Not as good as the Prodyne version,I had this pitcher a while ago and it was an ok product but not nearly as good as the one Prodyne makes.
2,Hold on to the top!,"A disappointment. After I brewed my loose tea , cooled it and went to pour a glass, I never expected the flimsy top to pop up open causing a gush of ice tea into my glass and all over my counter. Now I have to warn everybody about this when they pour a glass. They could have made a much better snug fit top instead of a flimsy hinged lid that does not stay closed."
3,"Good, but not great","This pitcher does what it says, but after using it for a few months I have to wonder if this pitcher is special enough to warrant the price. The 'pull in-pull out' compartment that holds tea bags or lemons is nice. But the plastic is so thin after a few uses it starts to warp out of shape. If youre not supposed to pour hot water in the pitcher, what is the point of using it? I really like the slim-ness of the pitcher overall (fits in the fridge well), and I don't mind its small capacity, but its overall fragile build leaves me wishing the manufacturers would have just created something more sturdy. I'd say someone is better off just brewing tea in a regular tupperware pitcher for half the price."
1,Slow Leak,I liked the product until it showed a small split in the bottom and developed a slow leak after only a few uses. Perhaps the plastic doesn't tolerate boiling water as well as it should.
2,Not Worth It For The Gimmick....,"Super fast shipping, but for a lousy overpriced pitcher that doesn't perform it's primary duty! I could have bought a bigger & cheaper acrylic pitcher. The ""infuser"" leaks all kinds of particles which ruins the whole batch. This thing is tiny!! Southerns' make large batches of iced tea & this pitcher wouldn't hold enough for a small family, let alone 2 ppl trying to have iced tea during the day."
4,love this tea maker,we've had the Bodum Tea Maker for about 3 mos. now and love it. I prefer to store tea in glass pitchers so we make the tea in this and then transfer to glass. I use a small mesh strainer to pick up any sediment. I make at least one container a day and haven't noticed any of the problems with melting or warping that others have had.
3,Just O.K.,I mostly needed this for loose tea and unless you have some pretty big leaves you are out of luck. The holes in the filter will cause your tea leaves to mix in with your tea which causes problems with taste not to mention the sheet amount of loose tea that comes through the filter. It does work great with tea bags and so far I have not had the filter warp or anything which is a common problem from the reviews I have read. The pitcher itself feels kind of cheap given the price but overall I guess it does what you need it too and three stars simply because loose tea is almost a lost cause in this pitcher.
2,"OK, it's a plastic pitcher","Nice size, doesn't take much space in the frig. I wish the lid was removable so that it would fit in the dishwasher. The lid moves only 90 degrees, which makes it almost impossible to fit in a dishwasher."
4,Bodum Ceylon 51-Ounce Ice Tea Maker with Filter,"I love this item because it makes brewing iced tea from loose leaf tea quick and simple, the only only thing I didn't care for on this item was the instructions which tell you in my opinion to add too much tea but that's just a preference once you brew on your own you can experiment with brewing times etc. to get the taste that's right for you. I also suggest pouring the hot water directly on top of the tea in the strainer rather then pouring in the larger section, this will allow for a more efficient steep."
2,broke after 6 months,"I love this iced tea pitcher, but after six months the lid broke off (we hadn't put it in the dishwasher). We are still trying to use it, but the lid keeps falling into the container. I emailed Bodum two weeks ago and have gotten no response. I usually love their products but was disappointed at the sturdiness of this as well as their lack of response."
4,Great iced tea pitcher BUT...,"The ""BUT"" stands for my sincere wish that the pitcher was about 50% larger and that the plastic of which it is made was just a little heavier. Otherwise, love it. Going to drink a lot of great iced tea this summer."
5,Another great thing to have... if you like Tea!,"As I said other times, I'd love Amazon to ship more things outside the US, but still, this one I could find... at last!I love tea, and I don't like just drinking a cup of tea... I like to drink A LOT of tea... so Iced Tea was one of my solutions... making tea in big pitchers was a great oportunity form making GOOD tea, and having a lot :)This pitcher is really handy because its easy to put the leaves in one side and then the water... and clear tea is made with no problems at all!The only dificult thing is removing the Tea if you add sugar... but any Tea Lover would tell you that adding sugar would be like killing the taste!"
4,"Fits easily in my refrigerator, height of milk container","The good thing about the 51 oz pitcher is that it is the same height as a milk carton, so it is not too tall to fit in my refrigerator. It is a nice fancy tea pitcher, with a flip up lid, and a easy to pour spout that does not spill the tea.Mine did come with instructions, and for the first brew, I followed the instructions and put seven (7) tablespoons of tea in the chamber. Gag! the tea was way too strong. After some experimentation I have settled on 2 Tablespoons and 3 minutes of steeping to make sure we don't get the bitter taste."
3,Clearly disappointed!,"I ordered two of the 51 ounce tea makers, fully expecting them to be as they were pictured - and as I have seen them in stores. However they arrived and were bright orange in color and definitely not see through as I wanted. I decided to keep them and get used to the color. They are fully functional and work very well - as well as the clear ones I am sure! So, although I'm disappointed in the actual appearance of the tea makers, we are still enjoying delicious cold tea. I bought two smaller ones in order to make and keep on hand two different kinds of tea at once. The clear ones would have allowed us to see clearly which kind of tea was inside, without opening them or smelling. And I am getting used to the startling color. I'm not so sure about my husband. He wanted me to return them. But I'm not planning to serve them at the table, so I decided to enjoy the low price I paid and deal with the garish color."
3,"Adequate, but the best I could find.","Many of the stories are too complex for babies and toddlers. For our 20 month-old we use only 4 of the 20 (or so) because of difficult content. Most of the actions mean you can't have the child sitting on your lap while reading the story. The actions, though, do help keep the child's attention. The pictures are simple enough for toddlers and babies, for adult tastes they definitely are too cutsey. The pages are very durable and withstand being handled by little hands. All in all, I'm still looking for a *good* Bible storybook."
4,Perfect for Toddlers,"This IS the book to use to teach your children Bible stories. The interactive methods (i.e. march like soldiers, give yourself a hug, etc.) make the stories more ""real"" to young ones. Each ""lesson"" contains the title, scripture the story is taken from, the story in children's term and 'actions' in order to act out the story."
2,Not What I Expected,"After all the good reviews this bible got I was very disappointed when it actually arrived. First the good things: Love all the interactive things it asks you to do with your child. I really think it will keep them focused. Also, I think the language used is just right. Not too complex but not too simple.However, I thought they left many important things out and many things were not explained. I realize that they are trying to keep the stories short but when it doesn't even say that Jesus was the son of God or why Jesus died, I think they are carrying simplicity too far."
3,Good heat- not as quiet as I thought,Easy install- good heat but a little loud when it starts to warm. Good product for the price. Optional thermostat is not worth it.
5,Great old time happy movie,"I love the wit and fun in this movie.Robert Young is adorableThe story is about family mischief,set in London. A well to do familyis faced with renewed scandal and a shortageof money.I enjoyed Jean Harlow's dry wit."
2,It's no Nick and Nora...,"A so-so screwball comedy, indifferently staged and poorly directed, starring Jean Harlow in one of her last roles, and Robert Taylor in an unconvincing turn as a happy-go-lucky, bon vivant playboy, who falls under Harlow's spell... Mostly filled with ineffective routines, though Reginald Owen steals the show as Taylor's priggish older brother, with some choice physical comedy late in the show... But otherwise this is pretty mediocre."
2,returned for refund,"Not sure if this was a one off defective product or symptomatic of over all quality control. I opened the package with much anticipation and saw immediately that the rings at the front of both eyepieces were put in crooked and surplus glue was caked in and around the rings. Next I noticed that when focusing, one eye piece got hung up internally and I had to free it by hand - every time I focused. Couldn't see the compass even when heeding advise of other reviewers and looking up down and around. Optics were clear enough, but, I couldn't live with the other issues so returned them for a refund and purchased the Bushnell Marine Binocular. I received those and am happy - yes you do have to individually focus the eyepieces but once focused depth of view is from quite close to infinity - pretty much everything you would look at when navigating a boat. They are bright and clear. If I want to zoom in on a flower I'll use my Pentax Papilios"
2,Product defective.,"The battery compartment came out of the binoculars, somehow permanently attached to the cap. They are going to be returned for a refund."
5,A Keeper,"I've listened to this CD a couple of times already and it only gets better each time. Spans the range from melodic and mellifluous to dark and brooding, the lyrics being reflective, soulful .. it's a keeper"
5,A Touching and Uplifting Journey Through Grief and Mourning,"My wife recently passed away after a three year battle with breast cancer. I bought this book because I'd read Bill Bridges' earlier books and found them insightful and refreshing. But I was totally unprepared for my personal connection to this particular book, which was written after Bill lost his wife through an almost identical struggle with cancer. It was as if he was telling my story and then helping me to both get through my own deep sadness and make some sense out of the painful process of mourning and grieving. This book does deal with transitions but it deals with much more and does so with great openness, sensitivity, and wisdom. I strongly recommend it to anyone dealing with the process of grief for the loss of a loved one. I learned far more from this book than I learned from any of the many books specifically written on that subject."
4,Classic work on transitions,"Bridges book makes a great contribution by describing the stages within a transition -- endings, the neutral zone (that awkward in-between place in transitions) and new beginnings. I use this concept often when coaching ministry leaders in transition. The book is somewhat profane but includes excellent, universal concepts about how humans experience transitions. You can find similar concepts worked out for ministry settings inCoaching Transitions: Walking with Leaders in the Turning Points of Life."
5,Essential reading,"This book is an essential item for any bookshelf. We all go through transitions, some more dramatic than others. This may not be a road map for your particular situation, but with real life stories and meaningful and well placed quotations, this reader felt genuine reassurance that not only was I going to be okay, the growth that comes through change is invaluable as I emerge from what was to what's next.One of my favorite quotes from Bridges book (page 42) is, ""Every beginning is a consequence -- every beginning ends something."" (Paul Valéry). As someone who is NOT at the beginning of their life, having just finished grad school, moved to a new city, new church, new job, etc., this book has been a great source of comfort and has provided lots of practical insight as I make my way through my new reality."
1,Thumbs down,I used this keyboard for 1 month before keys stopped working.Needless to say my experience was not satisfactory.
4,GoGo Pen,"I bought TWO pens, making it a 16 panel area for our 70 lb. pooch. We had to stabilize the pen on three large pieces of wood paneling for the floor so that she wouldn't dig underneath. We put a tarp over the top to provide shade and a green carpeting material on top of the wood so she'd be comfortable. It works well, but the doorway is a little skinny, ok for a dog, but a person has to go in occasionally to change food and water, etc. A single GoGo pen wouldn't have been enough room for our dog, but two is just fine. It's a good pen and works well for our needs when we're trailering."
3,Walk through Pen,"The product indicates you can easily remove the pin to attach a crate. However, unscrewing the pin was not easy at all as the bolt wouldn't come off. I had to saw off the bolt. Also, if you are planning on attaching a crate keep in mind the crate is shorter than the pen so there is an open gap which your dog can escape from. I used some extra panels to cover the gap. I really like the walk thru feature; it makes cleaning the pen much more convenient."
1,IT LEAKS,"I HAVE OWNED 6 OF THESE AND AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS EVERY ONE BEGAN TO LEAK AROUND THE LIP WHERE THE TWO LAYERS OF THE INSULATION MEET. COFFEE OR DISHWATER THEN GETS INTO THE INSULATED AREA AND LOOKS TERRIBLE. SOMEONE SHOULD TELL BODUM TO CORRECT THIS FLAW.. UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE FOUND NO OTHER FRENCH PRESS THIS SIZE THAT I COULD USE FOR TRAVEL."
4,Its OK.,"Do not put it in the dishwasher. Somehow it gets water between the two layers. I did it once and no hand wash it every time. I had a glass french press but broke it, this one is holding up well."
1,Does not last,Used it only 5 times. Lid leaks unless it is perfect. Cracked after 5th usage and it was not abused.
1,dreadful product,"On my third use the seal no longer worked. Can't tighten the top, tea leaks out and all over. This is my second, more fool me, purchase of this product. I'll never buy one again. Great idea, poor execution."
1,Disappointing,"Although I'd read other reviews before I bought the press saying that it leaked, I was optimistic that maybe this was just a sporadic problem as the other products I have from Bodum have worked well...but no, mine also leaked into the wall the very first time I used it...great idea, shame about the final product"
2,I wanted this to work,"so badly that I have bought a couple after the first one dripped. I thought its problems were my fault. I've come to realize, though, that it is not dishwater safe--even on the top basket. They crack almost immediately and boy, do they leak! And the press doesn't stay fixed to the filter. I want one that works. Please, Bodum, go back to the drawing board, fix this, and I'll be first in line to buy several."
2,Not intended for travel,"I have this coffee press and wonder if it was actually designed for travel? Not only does water/coffee sludge leak into the once-empty chamber between the plastic walls, but if you try to drink out of it, you're just as likely to get coffee in your shorts as you are to get it in your mouth. The lid falls off, it drips, it's really quite a mess. I use this press to make a single cuppa in the morning and then pour it into a real traveling mug, thereby saving my pants (and etc.) from an early-morning coffee disaster."
2,Yeah...it leaks really bad,Great concept. The problem is that the lid is hard to get on and sometimes you think its on when its not. It also has the leaking problem described. It leaks in between the layers and ultimately outside the tumbler itself. Starbucks is marketing a stainless steel version with a screw-on lid that could be the best of both worlds. I'm sure its made by Bodum also but it appears to be very heavy duty.
2,Grounds in my coffee..,"I found this item be of lesser quality than I expected. I do not recommend drinking directly from the press becasue it leaves grounds in the coffee. In order to avoid drinking coffee grounds, pour the coffee through a strainer and drink it out of a separate cup."
1,doesn't last,"I've had two of these now, and both have cracked and leaked within three months. Nice idea, shame about the durability. Certainly wouldn't bother with it again."
3,"Feeling hot, hot...not","The coffee is tasty, but despite the ""thermal"" plastic mug, it seems to be well on its way to cold by the time it's steeped enough. That's a caveat of french presses in general, but it seems to be more of a problem with this little guy than with the glass presses I use. I'm much happier with my 12-oz. glass bodum and a mug."
2,Filter loose and lets grounds pass!,"I'll give it 2 stars for being an insulated travel mug with a decent capacity, spout and plug; however, grounds leak through an apparent loose seal made by the filter. This is unacceptable. I have a cheapo travel press for camping made of lexan that doesn't leak grounds. If this isn't a big deal to you then it's a great press; personally, I don't like chewy coffee. The only way I use this is to pour into a mug and let the grounds settle, an obvious problem for a travel mug. It's also only getting 2 stars because I contacted Bodum about the issue and never heard back...I'd expect some customer support at this price range."
1,Gee. . .,"Well, it's a gold controller! Don't be fooled into thinking you need this if you're a Zelda fan. . . did anyone who got the Gold Edition N64 games honestly care after a week? Hmm. If you're a Zelda fan, then buy one of the new GB Zelda games--same price, you know."
1,Site Error,"This controller is probably made my Nintendo and not Sony Computer Entertainment, as Zelda is a Nintendo property and is made for the NINTENDO 64."
5,N64 Zelda Gold Controller,I bought this for my grandson and was extremely surprised when he opened it it came with a memory card-GREAT deal.
2,Slight deception,"I was a little surprised/disapointed with the dish dimentions. I can promise you the dish is NOT two inches deep (more like 1 1/2 inches. Also like the larger (2 1/2 qt), french white dish I ordered at the same time the bottom of the dish is unglazed, and very rough (and will scratch up your counters)."
5,PERFECT SIZE AND FUNCTION FOR MICROWAVING FOODS,Have used this product for over 8 years. The old top finally split. Was over joyed to find it on Amazon. Perfect for microwaving breakfast hash brown potatoes or sausage patties without the splatter. Dishwasher safe. Convenient and easily stored. Can't beat it for the price.
1,Did not receive the correct size,"I was not sent the correct size, but I refuse to waste my time running to the post office to return it."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!","The paper pickup system is an abomination. Most of the time it won't pick up. It constantly jams. You can't use labels in it because if they come off the paper, there is no way to get to them and remove them, and your machine is ruined. Konica replaced my first one for free because of this problem. There is hardly any ink in the starter cartridges and replacements are expensive. Ink powder sometimes flakes on to the paper and for the rare time it picks up the paper the paper is ruined. Buy an HP."
4,Theatre,"We used these for our school's production of Gilligan's Island. They were perfect for Gilligan and Skipper's comedy. They are very sturdy. Everyone who walked onto the set had to try them out, and high school kids aren't careful."
1,Unlucky 13,"Of all The Cooper's Michael Bruce was the most set on dumping the theater motif of the group. He had sort of a Michael Nesmith "" I want to be a serious musician""thing going. Now the man who would have taken the Alice Cooper show away from the fans comes crawling back with a load of warmed over hits from his glory days. Sad someone should have paid him to stay home. He hated the fans now he is washed up."
1,Defective Product!,These canisters are defective! After a minimum of use they develop cracks on the bottom which allow air to be drawn in.I bought three of these sets last Christmas. One to keep and two for gifts for my daughters. All three sets quickly became useless.I sent three canisters back to Black & Decker (shipping was $6.20) They replaced them but all three replacements soon cracked.
3,"Good info, but...","When I first received the book, I was disappointed that for the price all the illustration except in the addendum are in black and white and not very clear. There is good information in the book but not always very clear and easy to read. The illustration examples are sometime confusing and you have to go back and forth in the book to find the examples. Some chapters, like the first is very repetitive."
4,Ruth Buckmiller,I love this book and author but it appears to be a cheap or low quality reproduction. The color is faded and the paper quality is poor. That was a disappointment as I wanted this book for color education.
5,Composition Of Outdoor Painting,I chose this rating because the book is full of helpful imformation and it gets a good review from a lot of artists i would recommend this to all my painting friends
5,classic treasure,"I am pleased to have my own copy of this classic. I am a hobby painter interested in painting outdoors, and choosing what to include is a challenge. There are not many instructive books that seek to develop the reader's judgment, and I hope this is one of them. Many painting books are like copy books, how to copy the author's paintings, which can be instructive but not what I am seeking this summer. I am also pleased that Mr. Payne is disciplined with verbiage; too many modern writers go on too long. I believe this book will be part of my permanent reference collection--the books I never loan or give away or consider selling."
3,Composition of Outdoor Painting,"The condition of the book, of course, was excellent, so I give great review to the seller, but I was so disappointed in this book for the money. I thought it would be a nice art book--good illustrations, etc., but the illustrations are very boring and the book is very tiny. It has good information, but it's not real interesting---it's like studying for a course in college with a dry book with no pictures. It came highly recommended to me, so maybe I'm under-rating it, but I just thought it would be a much nicer book. As I said, no reflection on seller---my problem because I read the reviews and bought the book. Just one of those things. I would not recommend it to my fellow art friends. I'll loan them this one, but certainly wouldn't recommend they buy this for that much money."
3,"Attention, QC!","Great material, but MY GOD, this book needed to be gone over by a copy editor! What are publishing houses spending all their money on?"
5,Wonderful Snack!,The White Grape Peach flavor is the best! My 2yr old daughter and I love them. You can't go wrong with this snack.
2,Very bad,"I am one of those people you see who wait out in line for a store to open to buy a new Eminem CD. I found this one on-line and ordered it because no store had it. There is basically no rapping from him at all in the entire CD. It is of him giving his life story. If you want to hear about his life, then you might like this. Whereas, I just wanted to hear some good music, so I say it's a bad CD."
5,"I gave it as a gift,and it was well received!",I liked the timeline and straightforward presentation. I am pleased with the book. Book is attractive and good photography and pictures. Good maps.
3,Stop the music!,"Happy with the prayers on CD. Wanted to have knowledge of contents before purchased, but that was not available. The musicis very distracting. More info about contents needs to be available before purchase."
5,if only history was taught this way,one of the most disturbing and truth filled books. read this and you will never backdown from the facists again.true grit.
1,Effectiveness of this resource,"Don't get me wrong, I don't expect this to be published, but thought someone should proofread the title on this one... perhaps this book doesn't accomplish what the author set out to do. :-)"
1,Pile 'o Garbage,"This was a dreadful reading experience. There is absolutely no sense of organization, Muscio is painfully redundant, it is poorly written and just as poorly edited, and so very fluffy...even irresponsible at points. I honestly could not stop rolling my eyes. NOT recommended."
2,I preffered the sequel,"In this series on body orfices, I must say that this book was better than Earhole, but does not compare to Nostril."
4,Fishing for infectuous enthusiasm,"A stellar work of misogynistic feminism that finally portrays women in the light of neomodernistic nihilism. The essential arguments favoring transgender equity collapse under the pseudo-descriptive text, which follows the title in both style and content."
1,BORING AND PRETENTIOUS,THIS BOOK WAS A BIG DISAPOINTMENT. IT HAS OBVIOUSLY RECIEVED THIS UNWARRENTED ATTENTION DUE TO THE PLETHORA OF BLIND SUPPORT IN THE NEOFEMMINIST MOVEMENT. IT WAS BORING AND PRETENTIOUS
1,This book is awful,This book was pure drivel. It was the biggest waste of time I have ever had to endure. It is a load of ultra-feminist crap. I don't know what that mac840 person was thinking when he/she wrote her review.
2,"Some good ideas, but no backing","Reading through this book i was surprised by her hostility toward men in general despite her saying otherwise in her introduction. However, this is immaterial to the real issue: she doesn't back the majority of her ideas with any authority. Instead, she just asserts opinions as if they are facts, then builds more opinions on top of them as if they too are fact. It was an interesting read though, and i was entertained by a lot of her social commentary."
2,"Witty writer. Interesting topic, but too Negative and Opinionated","I liked the the author's witticism in the beginning, but it soon turned into a negative, expose of personal irresponsibilities seemingly justified by her candor and in-your-face style. It came across as a shock-value read, and I refused to finish it. I found her attitude negative, immature, self-justifying, ranting and not empowering at all. I'd prefer a more peaceful and empowering writer on this topic. Somewhat analogous to race wars and Malcolm X pre Mecca. For ME, the message is best delivered via MLK Jr's peaceful and approachable manner."
1,Horrible Depiction,"Anyone who wants to read a horrible depiction of an abortion should buy this book. The author condones the killing of an unborn fetus and even tells of how she did it three times, once on her own at home even. I threw this book away and will never buy another book by the author. Anyone who is Pro-Life should definately NOT support this author is ANY WAY! This woman disgusts me!"
5,Everyone should read it.,"If I could afford it, I'd buy this book for every one of my students. Male and female. If they love it, great. If they don't they need to figure out why they don't."
4,Happy Cuntlovin',"When my friend called me and began to read this book over the phone, I knew that I had to have it. I don't consider myself a feminist and you really don't have to be to enjoy the book. Not only does Inga encourage you to create a sisterhood, she also gives some healthy alternatives to products of the ""male social power structure."" I felt heartened by this book because this woman is so in touch with the goddess and learning to love yourself rather than living in a society that teaches us to hate all things womanly. Say hello to the moon and get on with all that is cuntloving."
3,The largest sex organ is the mind......,"An interesting etymology polluted by whacky hippie stew-brained lifestyle suggestions, which makes the archaeology of knowledge and thesis suspect. So this is no field manual for the Tactical Women's Assault Team on their take-back-the-night-language-history-power-whatever rampage. Still, that this book exists at all is evidence of the triumph of Western civilization over the primitivism this author confuses with her projections of ideological and bucolic freedom.Really fun to have on your college dorm bookshelf. Sure to attract arguments with hairy-legged man-hating hags and fundy know-nothings alike, so crack a beer and prepare yourself for a non-Aristotelian laugh riot of a Symposium. First person to mention Chomsky looses."
3,shoulda bought it sooner,i shoulda bought this product when it was a little cheaper. Oh well. You live you learn.
3,Problems Fixed,"Although I was not happy at first, the provider was very concerned about my happiness, so I would definitely order from them again."
4,Not bad for the price,"After reading other reviews, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to assemble. I have assembled many pieces of furniture, so I was familiar with all of the hardware. It took me about 4 hours to assemble. The instructions were vague in some areas, but I was able to figure it out. This laminate-wood desk is not a quality piece of furniture, but is worth the price and perfect if you need more storage space. We put it in our bedroom and use the drawers for socks, underwear and other ""light"" clothing as the drawers are not the sturdiest."
3,candid and personal,Liz's childhood experience comes alive through these pages. Her story of 5-yr old Cassandra and the abuse she endures at the hands of her older brother and others is honest and real. Cass is courageous and strong. ...
4,A really good buy,"I have owned a number of espresso machines (currently a Capresso C3000). I use the Bodum Espresso Pot when I am working away from home. My conclusion is that I wasted my money when buying the Capresso since this the Bodum Espresso Pot makes a perfectly good espresso with little fuss. The secret to any good cup of coffee is acquiring the appropriate coffee in the first place.The device is easy to clean and to use - just make sure that the top is sufficiently tight, so that no water boils out between the top and bottom. On occasions I forget to put in the filter disc, with unfortunate effects, but this is my problem. The only criticism I would make is that the top and handle are held by a single screw. This becomes loose and must be tightened on a regular basis."
1,Does not worth.,"It is too bad. It is too difficult to clean it. When it is on the electrical stove, the water goes out from the middle line instead from the top EVEN when you tighten it, WHY??!!"
1,What is the point,"Although it may seem ike a good idea, you need not, nor really should, store garlic in the refidge or inside a plastic or glass dome. I have not used this gadget, but looking at it I assume moisture would build inside of the dome, BAD for the garlic. I keep mine in a little paper bag in a bowl on the counter. I use a paper bag only because my bird is quite fond of nibbling on things, and she seems quite fond of garlic. I must agree with the first review of this item, it is unnecessary and possibly a bad idea."
3,Lots of good info...and some bad,"While there are some excellent maps and excerpts from original letters that you will not find anywhere else, Neame does not ever develop the title personage. Instead we get to hear about what everyone else thought of her, but no scholarly conjecture about Barton herself. Lest you think the author is a serious historian above comitting conjecture, his superstition is very clear whenever he talks about visions, prophecies, possessions and archangels as absolute fact. He also has quite a bone to pick about the English Reformation--he sounds as upset as though it happened last year. There's also a bit too much archictural description, what kind of dung the walls were made of, etc. Skim it."
5,Durable and efficient brush,This works great on my wood burning stove fireplace chimney. Use twice so far and it makes a quick and clean job. Even used it on a fireplace chimney
5,Item as described and shipped fine.,"This item was just as described and shipped fine to me.Another review stated they had problems with the shipping, and it sounded like the seller tried to make it right. But I had no problems with the shipping.For the price, you can't go wrong! When I bought this, it was a little over ten bucks delivered to my door. It screwed on to my poles easy and is made strong enough to do the job. They only problem I had is it didn't fit into my specific stove pipe? The 8 inch model worked perfect for me in my 8 inch pipe. But when I get to the part in the pipe where it downsizes to 6 inches this 6 inch cleaner will not fit. I'm almost sure it has something to do with my specific piping, so this does not reflect the product. I'm going to use heavy wire cutters and try to make it a little smaller to fit since the 8 inch one worked so well.Keep your stove pipe clean, and stop a chimney fire from happening. Also save yourself cash and do it yourself... but be careful up there."
4,"6"" chimney brush head",Does the job adequately enough. It is tough and durable. Be warned that it is very difficult to pull the brush head back out unless it goes all the way out past the other end of the pipe first. You can't go half way and pull it back out.
5,brush,"just what I needed, great service and price. ordered poles with it, works perfect, will refer to others who need one"
1,made in America--really??,"Buyer beware. For a product made in America, performance of this chimney brush out of the box bordered on bait and switch. When I took it out of the box and attempted to thread the brush onto my chimney rod, the individual bristles started to fall out of the wire wrappings. Attempts to tighten it were in vain, so I sent it back. I'm extremely disappointed after spending so much time investigating online to find a company in the USA that would market such a piece of junk as this."
2,"more like suede than leather, bulky and narrow","I bought this for my husband because he prefers trifold wallets. It has two zippered compartments and an extra money divider that make it bulky (thick), even when there's nothing placed in them. The texture is like suade, which makes it hard to get in and out of a pant pocket. The credit card compartments are tight and narrow so the cards are hard to remove/replace. He was not happy with it, though he did appreciate the thought, and now I'm searching for another one for him."
4,Rating is not based on the DVD itself...,"I remember watching this game when it originally aired and it was a GREAT game! The Colorado Buffaloes won 10-9 over Notre Dame. However, Raghib ""Rocket"" Ismail had an incredible punt return TD called back because of a clipping penalty. Had the return counted, Notre Dame would have won the game.I don't recall if the Colorado Buffaloes won the national championship as a result of this game... I only recall that there was some controversy over who should have won because Georgia Tech was the nation's only unbeaten team."
3,Fell short of expectations,"Was expecting a more complicated or advanced coverage. This is roughly high school information, freshman college at the very most."
5,"Patience is a virtue, but I can't wait for Vol. 2","I have to admit that I was a bit worried when I saw that there were only two tracks: my frazzled nerves and short-attention span wander during the course of even a four-minute pop song. But from the first note, I knew that I had to buy a second copy because it was just too good not to share. Listening required no effort on my part; it was like floating on a calm sea of sound, rising and falling with the gentle motion of aural waves. The steady repetition of what I can only describe as instrumental mantras is refreshing and unobtrusive. I am always a bit sad and surprised when the second track ends; Electronic Atmospheres takes me to a place somewhere outside of time, and quietly promotes and facilitates the restorative relaxation and internal reflection that escapes my conscious efforts.It is an antidote to the literal and figurative noise in my life, and I highly recommend it to anyone who could use a little peace in his or her life."
3,Not as good as the Nail Hunter....,"These are an unusual idea, but why not just get a Nail Jack or Nail Hunter?8.5 inch Nail Hunter from Nail Jack Tools"
4,Calm behind the wheel...,I've been listening to this audio piece while driving on and off for the past few weeks and it's really helped me. I feel so much calmer and more relaxed when driving. I remember some of the little tips even when I'm not listening to it.
3,not really mindfulness,"I was hoping for a CD that would consistently keep me focused on the road, driving and self awareness, attention etc. while driving, however this is more of a teaching tool about mindfulness and nice stories shared by Sylvia. For example, she has you think about the first time you drove a car and how it felt. In my understanding of mindfulness it is about the now, not thinking about stories of the past while I am driving. I can however appreciate the stories and lessons shared. It just wasn't what I was expecting."
4,Great Microphone,"The Sennheiser E835-S is a great microphone. It does everything that I expected from it. It's built well and I've never had any issues with it. I use Sennheiser's for both vocals and guitar cabinets. No problems, sounds great. Great products!"
2,This was a gift,"Tos was a gift for my 11 year old cousin , he started playing with it right away. A lot of reading , not a lot of photos."
2,Not so practical as promised,I was expecting a simple quide to easily understand some tricks. Actually did not attacted me. The figures also not helpful.
4,The true expert will be able to embellish these tricks.,"Karl Fulves is a wonderful writer. He has a concise, clear, and laconic style that I find refreshing. If you need a break from struggling with the serious, heavy tomes of card magic, this book will be an easy read. I must admit to a bias: I don't really like the majority of self-working card tricks. Unless they are abetted with some rudimentary sleights such as false shuffles, they come off as exactly what they are--self-working card tricks. That said, the serious card worker will easily be able to add sleights to the slick tricks presented here and make them really outstanding. For that Fulves deserves his four stars. It's a great book and value for the beginner and expert."
2,Only for beginner...,"The book is well written. Explanations are really good but, the tricks are for BEGINNER! Some of them are so evident that I wouldn't even do them in front of my 6 years old nephew. But still, you have some (maybe 2 or 3) good tricks. So for the price, it's still good if you want to get into card tricks."
2,did not work for us at all,"We got this to make our salt dough Christmas ornaments a little more durable as I had read that covering them in a thin layer of polyurethane can make them last for many years. When I sprayed it on I immediately noticed that this spray is not crystal clear at all but gives an ugly white film over everything we sprayed it on too. I had to scrape it off to save our ornaments. I guess for different purposes it might work. For us, it turned out to be completely useless."
3,Catalyst for discussion and reflection,"This is a great tool to start thinking about Islam and some of the current issues regarding Islam and its relationship with the West. A chapter on terrorism is helpful but dated considering the events of 9/11. Still the book is useful in the broad range of opinions that it presents. Also has a handy ""for further reading"" list in each chapter if you want to dig deeper.Perhaps the book should be updated post 9/11 since so much more has been written and said about the subject."
4,Title Diff,"What is the difference between this ""Pilates Perfect"" title & another one by the same author, which I checked out from my local library, titled ""Power Pilates""?Both have the same publishing year, publisher & #10 ISBN, but the library book doesn't list the #13 ISBN. Both are PB, but this one on amazon is listed as having 200pgs, & the library one has 259pgs.I don't find ""Power Pilates"" by the same author, listed in any book site, including amazon, ebay, powell's, barns & noble/borders.What happened with the title between the amazon version & the library version? is the latter just a title variation only used for library editions, with all the same insides, or are the insides different in any way other than the number of pgs?anyone?p.s. they both have the same subtitle too."
5,"Flowing, connecting, engaging","Guess I read a different book than some reviewers, but this book is intriguing, engaging, and entertaining. Great airport or deep in the woods reading."
3,"intriguing, but monochrome","The metaphysics of alternate realities is intriguing, but the author trips over himself in making the ""aliens"" the embodiment of pure evil. Shades of gray would have been better. The Hollywood ending doesn't help either."
1,"Atrocious writing, juvenile storytelling","I quickly lost track of how many times characters chuckled, how many statements began with outdated 1950's-style diction (this is NOT due to regionalisms in Vermont English), and, most damning of all, how many sentences ended in exclamation points.Poorly written, blandly portrayed, stocked with cardboard characters who were either purely virtuous or purely evil, the book was a colossal disappointment. It's the rough equivalent of an after-school special. Stay clear."
1,Read Lovecraft instead,"So, this novel reads like a bad high school creative writing class assignment. A nebulously defined evil computer technology makes evil spirits/the devil/Elder Gods possess people and drives them to slaughter others so their souls form food for the nebulous evil force. Driven by a flimsy plot and too many strands, it's too much for Citro to juggle cogently. If you want this sort of horror, you're much better off reading the masters of New England horror and turning to Lovecraft, Poe, Stephen King, or anyone, practically. Save your time with this one."
5,taller,I love the Black & Decker Lids off. My hands hurt all the time because of the computer work I do. The only problem is it does not open tall bottles like water or pop bottles. It would be wonderful if they made a small portable battery operated lid opener for bottles.
5,HAS THE STRENGTH MY HANDS DON'T,"I was extremely pleased with this can opener, but most of all witn the jar opener. It sure does the work for artheritic hands."
4,Works perfectly.,"As a person who suffers from nerve damage due to neck injuries, opening jar lids has proved to be quite a challenge. However, this little contraption provides a tool to help my life seem more normal. It is very easy to use.Because it does take up so much counter space, however, I took off a star. If it had a smaller footprint that would be nice."
5,Black & Decker Jar Opener,"We are very pleased with the jar and can opener.We are in our late 70's, and opening jars can often be tough on hands and wrists.Once you read, and follow, the instructions, this kitchen appliance is efficient and easy to use. A welcome addition to the kitchen counter.The price was excellent, also."
5,Mother's Day Gift,"Product was delivered in time for Mother's Day. My mother-in-law loves it and uses it all the time. Was great to find, beings I couldn't find it in our local stores."
4,Review of my lid opener,"The primary reason for choosing this product was for the jar opening feature which works great. The can opener can be a bit tricky it trying to engage the can you are trying to open. I have to make several attemps befor I am sucessful,then when I disengage the lid, the cutting unit detaches from the opener."
2,enjoy it while it lasts,"I gave this to my parents and they loved it....for a few weeks until it broke. So I bought them a second one. And they really liked that one for a few weeks too until, well stop me if you've already heard this one. Yep, a great idea for those unable to open jars easily, but the plastics aren't up to repetitive labor and the machine conks out very easily. C'mon Black and Decker, refine this concept so the product keeps on performing for a few years!!! An upgrade from plastic to something more permanent would be a great start. It's a shame because older folks really need something like this that works and keeps on working."
4,Lids Off,We like our opener very much. It's great for soda bottles. Use it for opening pickles and spaghetti sauce.
2,Can opener not helpful,"The can opener can only be used in the down position, which is very low, for standard and tuna cans. Doesn't work for larger cans you get mostly at the warehouse stores or for yams. Wish they made the the top go up to lock in different positions, it would probably alleviate the problem, but the base may be awkward and only hold half the can up. It goes up for the jars then sits on the jars and locks at the base, but there is no lock for the top portion of this product, it's either up or in the down position. Didn't get to try the jar or bottle opener, we returned it. Please try again Black and Decker.KRS, South New Jersey"
1,Complaint,"I recieved the product as ordered but found it to be larger tnan picture and too bulky for my use. On two different occasions in the past month I have requested procedures to return the product and both times I have been told that a Label, with instructions, would be sent for returning the product and a credit would be granted. I still have not recieved either label or a credit for the product. I have no use for the combination opener and since I requested a credit and procedure for return within the required time limit I expected to have it and do not after over three weeks of trying to get cooperation. I will not be using this site for further purchases."
1,WHAT HAPPENED?????,"I HAD THIS ITEM (AND OTHERS)IN MY SHOPPING CART AT THE PRICE OF $29.99... AS I WAS REVIEWING ONE OF THE COOKBOOKS THAT WAS SUGGESTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE THE PRICE OF THE OPENER WENT TO $49.99 AS I WAS SHOPPING AND IT WAS ALREADY IN MY CART FOR THE $29.99!! IS THIS HOW AMAZON AND IT'S STORES WORK?? QUITE UNPROFESSIONAL I MUST SAY!! I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN NOT ORDERING THE ITEM BUT IN AMAZON TOO. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE BACK!B.J. WEST PALM BEACH, FL"
5,A plus for Senior Citizens,My husband and I are both in our 80's. I have arthritis and so with arthritis and old age we were finding it very difficult to open our favorite jars of fruit from the produce dept. The Black and Decker Lids Off opens the jars without spilling any juice. Even the can opener seems better than my old electric can opener. M.J.C.
2,Nothing Special,It is an okay product. It takes up alot of room on a small counter. It does what it is supposed to however - it can be difficult to utilize some of the mechanisms especially if you have arthritis or other handicap.The jar opening part of the product is pretty straight forward - the can opener is all right but the bottle opener is hard to use and I broke the top lip of a bottle the 2nd time I used it. I don't think I would reccomend this product to most people.
1,Don't ruin your cat!,"I purchased this book awhile ago and can say the techniques used in this book are not ones you want to use with your cat.For instance, the author stresses you should train your cat not to purr, by telling it ""No"" everytime it begins to purr. I followed their advice and now have a harder time telling when my cat is happy as he doesn't purr anymore.Also, when disciplining your cat not to chew on wires behind a multimedia cabinet, the author mentions putting Tabasco brand sauce on the wires so the cat stays away. Again, this backfired as my cat developed permanent stomach problem that, after $800 worth of vetrinary tests, I can only link to the Tabasco ""training"" he recieved.Obviously, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't. Please don't ruin your cat!!!"
5,The Granny Peeler You Always Wanted,"I started buying Rada cutlery at one of the big Home & Garden Shows because I was tired of cheap knives and of peelers that just didn't work. This knife is simply the best for the price - you don't need to spend a fortune on the German brands - this U.S. made knife is every bit as good at a fraction of the price. It is fantastic for doing apples and other fruits.The knife stays extremely sharp - I've nicked myself a number of times when I got too close to what I was cutting. You can keep the blade super sharp by using the Rada sharpner, so there's no need to replace this knife ever.The only drawback, if you are into appearances, is that the handle will discolor if it is not dried after washing or if you allow it to sit in water. Also, these knives should not be put in the dishwasher if you care about appearance - the handle will get darkened and somewhat pitted."
4,"Great gadget for those who love lattes, etc......","Yes it is a great gadget and no I did not give it five stars. There is only one flaw, if you fill it to its maximun it can overflow and be a bit messy. My solution is to sit it inside the sink when frothing so the mess is contained. Another solution is to just put a bit less in but that is too easy. The only comment I truly wanted to add to the other reviews is that it can froth NON FAT milk. It amazes me that non fat milk can be whipped to a consistenty that is so thick and satisfying. If you are a dieter and have a sweet craving I highly recommend using 4oz of strong coffee or expresso that you brewed in your Bodum French Press, a packet of artificial sweetener all in a large mug (like 10-12 oz), then top with your warm frothed milk and a shake of cinnamon. That is nirvana and a very low cal way to get a big sweet fix!"
5,One of my favorite!,Great pace! Brings out the passion and pep of it all. The other positive reviews are correct! Enjoy! Great gift this season!
5,Big Beak Birds,"This is one of the cutest pattern books I've purchased for my plastic canvas hobby in a long time. The finished items go into my gift shop, and the customers love them!"
3,"Math sample test questions much harder than actual test, Verbal is more representative","This book is detailed and extensive in its coverage of ASVAB topics. The one complaint I would lodge is that it's math sample tests use questions that are, in general, much harder than anything you will encounter on the real test. The real test is basic math with nothing very tricky. If you can master the Kaplan practice tests you WILL score a 96 or better on the real ASVAB. The instructional sections are good (especially the verbal), with good advice and test taking strategies. I would recommend the ""ARCO ASVAB Math Review"" for a more realistic representation of the math portion of the test. I used both this book and the ARCO book and scored a 97 (highest is 99)."
4,gets under your skin,"i picked this disc up on advice of a friend who'd included it in her list here. on first listen, only a couple of tracks held my attention. but after a few plays, the others began to take hold. what you ultimately notice is that the melodies and lyrics weave together to create a kind of sad but sometimes beautiful state of mind. listened to late at night, it makes sense."
1,"""Breeder"" glorifies negligent parenting","If this book represents our future, as raised by the current crop of parents, then I weep for our future. The parents described in this book sound like horrors from a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. Perhaps one must be a parent to find these stories amusing or beneficial in any way. For this non-parent, ""Breeder"" triggered boredom at best and disgust at worst. Erma Bombeck did parenting humor much better, and without nauseating stories such as children gnawing on vibrators."
1,"Pardon the cliche, but big waste of trees","I would give this zero stars given the chance. First, the title is very misleading. These are not essays by ""the new generation of mothers,"" but rather teen, welfare and wanna-be hippie moms. These flighty, immature, irresponsible writers do NOT represent my generation. (I am 30.) Just take a glimpse at the biographies in the back before you decide to read this drivel. One author is described as a ""second generation welfare mama."" Now there's a source of pride. These essays include the story of a teenage birth mother who led a potential adoptive couple to believe she was going to give them her baby, then changed her mind after the baby was born, as well as the story of a woman who aborted her baby after she decided to let her body be a pawn to the patriarchy. I am paraphrasing, but trust me, the actual language is even more ridiculous. There are a couple of semi-decent essays here, but it's not worth wading through the rest to find them."
5,Five stars from author Cecelia Cancellaro,"As the author of a book of stories about pregnancy (Pregnancy Stories) and an avid reader about books on the subject of motherhood, I am overwhelmed with enthusiasm for this amazing, provocative, and impressive collection. There is no other book that presents motherhood in such depth and with such honesty, insight, and diversity and for that I think every mother must read Breeder. Let it be said that I am probably seven to ten years older than most of the Breeder contributors. However, this age difference didn't make the book any less relevant or validating to me. I have already purchased it as a gift for several friends and I urge all Moms to read these essays. Within them you will find support for and insight into the ideas, emotions, worries and joys that mothers grapple with constantly. Brava to these mamas for giving us something so necessary and so refreshing."
1,sigh,"From reading the pages of this book that are posted here, all I can do is say ""groan."" I am a ""gen-x-er"" and am so tired of the self-indulgent, me-focus of ""my"" generation. This book looks ridiculous."
2,not impressed,"It's exfoliating, all right. On the plus, it does leave my skin smooth, but it kind of hurts getting there. The size and shape make it awkward to hold, and because the outer covering is so thick, it's hard to get it rinsed really clean. Wouldn't purchase again."
2,Ho hummmm,"This is a poorly presented ""training"" video. The various participants spoke off the cuff. That was fine for demonstrators of various abilities, but the main participants were mainly interested in pushing the product.There appeared to be no script and no editing. More than a few times a club face was described as showing something, but the camera angle did not show what was intended.I used the ""transferable impact ink"" pen and after about 8 hits, the pen was dry and I could not mark any more balls. I tried to send an email to the company about this but was unsuccessful."
2,Poor Audio Quality,"although the songs are wonderful,the audio quality should be questioned.low volume with not much bass.i got by with these songs until i heard Carpenters Gold,35th Anniversary edition.wow...what a difference.that edition has been remastered nicely."
5,Carpenters Are The Best -- Tracks info as follows:,"1. Yesterday Once More 2. Superstar 3. Rainy Days And Mondays 4. (Want You) Back In My Life Again 5. Ticket To Ride 6. Goodbye To Love 7. Bless The Beasts And Children 8. It;s Going To Take Some Time 9. Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft 10. Sweet, Sweet Smile 11. I Won't Last A Day Without You 12. For All We Know 13. Touch Me When We're Dancing"
4,Best purchase for training EVER.....,"There are so many ""how to train"" products out there and most are so academic so as not to be practical. This book is easily understandable, fun and most of all, practical. I have already incorporated most of what I've read and have seen dramatic improvement in our new employees' performance. Reading this book was as comfortable as talking with a friend over coffee, very informal and very fun! Thank you!"
5,Good reference tool for new trainers,This book includes a great set of basic tools and concepts that can be implemented into many types of training environments.
5,Great for all trainers,This is an easy to read book with very useful information on what to take into consideration in terms of designing and delivering training.
2,Kindle version is poorly formatted,"The content of this book is awesome, and as a teacher, I think it is easily a 4 or 5 star rating. However, the formatting for Kindle is terrible enough to render it essentially unuseable. I would really like to get my money back on this purchase."
4,"""Telling Ain't Training"" is mandatory reading","Even if a prospective classroom instructor isn't required to read the whole book, they MUST be required to read the book's title aloud in a classroom setting, then ask the class what it means."
3,"Good content, high price, poor Kindle formatting","As far as I can tell, this is a book of great content. Certainly all the other reviewers think so. The print and Kindle formats are both fairly expensive. The challenge: the Kindle formatting is a mess. It's readable, but just barely. No page break between chapters, lots of multi-column tables that are inserted as one column, so you can't tell which items are in column A and which are in B.I recommend that you buy the book in print; the Kindle version isn't worth it."
5,Telling Aint Training,"Great book!! Any body in the training field should get a copy. Herald Stolovitch and Erica Keeps keep the reader involved throughout the entire book with constant examples and activities that are very interesting and fun. I am in the US military and training is constant in my job. Techniques are drawn out and easy to understand, making it easy for anybody to comprehend and transfer to their own training. The use of the five step training model really sets up how a training session should be held. I will use this book over and over again in the development of my professional training career."
3,Some good ideas in the sketches,"My chief complaint is the photographs used to illustrate how Lowell's ideas and sketches were carried out DO NOT at all compare to the photos of the empty original rooms. It is extremely hard for the eye to determine the angle and placement. Several photos I couldn't even figure out what area of the room I was looking at. The AFTER photos are too close up and it's impossible to use them as a reference or anything more than a vague idea. BAD PHOTOGRAPHY.I did get a few ideas for small spaces. I found a lot of use of the same colors over and over again, same plush fabrics and lawrence-of-arabia style draping. A bit lush and overdone for the typical home perhaps? I like his ideas very much though about clutter and making the most of your surroundings. But please re-issue with better photographs of the results of his ideas and works! What a disappointment in that regard."
4,Browse for Ideas,"This was a bit of a let down, as I'd loved Lowell's Dream Decor On A Budget. This one is choppy and hard to follow. Reading his descriptions and then trying to find what he's talking about in the photos is tough.Some of the rooms are delightful and there's quite a few do-it-yourself projects included (mission style table, settee-divider, island bed).They included too many photos of Lowell, making it seem like a fan club book rather than a serious decorating guide."
2,Misleading!! Not really for tiny spaces.,"I don't watch cable tv and Christopher Lowell isn't familiar to me, but I was eager to read this book as I have a number of small rooms. I was extremely disappointed to find that all the rooms in the book were comparatively huge. I was hoping for decorating tips for rooms 12 x12 and smaller. Oh, well. Some of my friends who have bigger rooms have been happy to borrow it."
5,Great Book!,"Christopher's use of small spaces is clever in this book, his sense of color and style always amazing. Many of the rooms were taken from a Fleetwood Manufactured Home and the transformations can give anyone hope for decorating small spaces. Highly recommended."
3,Over the top decorating - and not in a good way,"Christopher Lowell comes so close to getting it right but unfortunately doesn't seem to know when enough is enough, not just over the top. He uses the word ""merchandising"" a lot and...well...his rooms often look like department store displays, so filled with things that it is hard to imagine living (let alone breathing) in those rooms. Subtract half of what he puts in the average room and you'd have a decent space. But, please, Christopher, stop before it gets tacky. A living room is not a window display in a shopping mall."
2,Practical but nothing new,"Christopher Lowell is pretty good at making the most of space. It's just his taste that I can't stand. This book is practical and has some clever ideas in it, but I've seen it all before in other books and magazines."
2,Dissapointing,"They look impresive, however you can barely see stars or planets, all you can get is what you see at plane sight but a bit more clear.Given that they are really heavy, you cannot usem them without a tripod which I bought by the way, but if you are using the tripod you can see the horizont and impossible to watch above yourself.For terrestrial purpose they are really good tough."
5,Celestron Skymaster 25x100,"The Celestron Skymaster 25x100 binoculars are exceptional with two faults...These faults are not per say a problem with the binoculars...They were not packed very well...Being a precision optical instrument one would think that they would have been packed with utmost care...Due to the lack of the packageing I had to go through the trouble of sending them in and having them collimated...Another experience I did not like dealing with...Celestron was not very easy to deal with and I had to make some well placed threats to get any service...My suggestion would be to please, please, if it is a precision instrument, pack it properly so as to avoid any damage to the optics during transit...Thank you...Jesse"
1,Frustrating,"The other comments on the mounting screw having a lot of play are very true. Tighten all you want, duct tape might work better. The magnification is strong enough that, after 6 months, I found a tripod to be mandatory. The Celestron recommended tripod added to my frustration. I never thought that something as basic as going to a point in the sky and having a steady view would be such a chore. The biggest gripe I have with these binocs is the chromatic aberration. With daytime use this isn't noticeable but a few stars or a planet against a dark sky and it is a significant problem. I expected some aberration at the edges, after all these aren't $3,000 binocs, but what I found was I had it dead center. Recently I had a great view of Jupiter with 3 moons visible. I was hoping to spend several minutes taking in the sight and seeing if I can make out features on the planet. Instead it was a collection of roundish rainbows that had me back in the house after a few seconds."
4,Extremely informative & educational for women in recovery from addictive substances.,"Several of my female friends in recovery expressed an interest in reading more on the subject of women, sex & addiction when it was mentioned recently in a 12-step recovery meeting. I recalled having read excerpts from the above publication many years ago. I quickly went to the internet to look it up and found the publication, which I promptly purchased so we could all study it. We are now in the process of doing so. This was a much overlooked subject and area in field of substance abuse recovery for women. It is needed and women need to be more aware and educated. We all appreciate the insight gained from this book. Thanks to the author."
5,cried in the first 50 pages,This book might have been written awhile ago but I read every single word..there was not a false note in it.I felt she was revealing what i had not known about myself for my whole life.I cried I took notes i underlined words phrase all paragraphs I want to show my children.Maybe then they can understan why I was the way I was with them growing up..It explained me I will read it again .. to m ake it sink in... 10 stars if possible...it touched me deeply.......
3,An updated version would be nice.,I love Charlotte Kasl's books! However this particular book could definately use an updated version to coincide with new information and awareness.
2,an imaginative attempt,"I bought this book first year and really wish I hadn't. All of the neccesary information is found in Deadman's ""A Manual of Acupuncture"" and I memorized bad information about the shu points.I quoted some of this information in China to classically trained Daoists and in hospitals and they laughed at me.Now I know better and I understand why they were laughing. Much like Worsley, this kind of information appeals to the Westerner's imagination because it was created in a Westerner's imagination. At the time the only thing to be had were poor quality books from China with vague information. In this vaccuum of real information imaginations flourished. The time of infancy in the profession is over, its maturing and requires more sound scholarship.My book is somewhere in storage and even though I can make eight bucks selling it to amazon, I won't do you the injury."
3,Good for what it is... but I've found some errors.,"Nigel Wiseman's ""Grasping the Wind"" is an alright book for understanding how some of the names came to be; however, there are a lot of typos and a lot of the phases of the Shu Antiques are incorrect.Besides that, it is what it is..."
1,Rip Off,"I ordered the CD on April 27, 2009. I never received it. I have sent a couple of inquires to the seller via email. I never received a response. I am very disappointed because I had looked every day in the mail box. I had already received the shipment of Revelation which I had ordered the same day. There has never been any explanation for the delay. If the item is out-of-stock, the seller should have sent a refund. I just feel ripped off."
3,It is not exactly what I expected,"I only watched it once, it wasn't as helpful for me as I had hoped it would be."
2,Privacy and screen protector,It is a screen protector but not a privacy screen as you can still see the screen. I would not reccomend this item.
1,Not good,"sharp edges cut my finger, its not a privacy screen at best its a screen protector, it only works if you stand behind the computer screen,and it covers up information on the edges that you need to read....but then what do you expect for $10, you get what you pay for!!!"
3,Just OK,Does an OK job of obstructing view from an angle. Not as good as some. Decent product for the price. It just depends on how much privacy you require.
4,Beautiful Latin Love Album,"A beautiful romantic hit from Alvaro Torres, this collection will put you in a romantic mood quick. Songs to listen for is ""Stress"", ""De que Sirve Quererte"" and ""Solo Te Tengo a Ti""."
4,Muy fantastico!,"Me gustan ""Me quedare solo"", ""El Principe Valiente"", ""Sera"", ""Angelus"" y ""Bendita Seas"". ""Sera"" es bonita y erotica con efecto de la letra y la voz de Cristina. Por supuesto, la voz unica de Alberto es inolvidable. Os lo recomiendo!"
1,wobbles and squeaks!,"for the price point, i was expecting something a lil more worthy than the cheap Icon Fitness models (NordicTrack/Proform) but what i got was something that felt just as cheap.the unit wobbled tremendously (i'm only 170lbs) and after 10 mins, the foot units started squeaking like crazy. and all of this on the very 1st day of use!"
5,Awesome,"I read this book a few years ago. The story remains with me to this day both in memory and in my library. it's one book I frequently return to every so often. Ivan Cat has a smooth, consistent revelation to his story. I especially like the comments from Madness and Loneliness at the opening of the chapters. I have been patiently waiting since 1996 for a sequal- hoping Ivan won't disappoint."
3,Kagome Doll is cute(:,It is a nicely made plush.Only one thing.I paid twenty-five dollars for it.And it was only 6 inches.I measured it from head to toe.So if your looking for a Kagome doll I would buy it from somewhere cheaper like ebay or something.It`s okay cause I still think the plush is cute(:
3,Wall Mount Dryer,"I found this when we went to a hotel, loved the size and convenience. Thought if the hotels use them they must be good quality. I bought one and was wonderful for a couple of years then the switch broke, so I bought 2 more, one to replace the broke one and one for guest bath. Just received them on Aug. 6 and the switch on the low setting already broke. Did not last a full month. Will look for others."
5,hair dryer,I have been using this dryer for over three months and have been very happy with it's performance. The size was just right for my space.
5,Predjudice,"This graphic novel shows just how seriously predjudice and simple ignorance can cause serious harm. In this case, they cause the death of two young children, for being ""Born different"". It is refreshing to see one of the earlier times when Magneto aids the X-Men, even if his methods are unorthodox and ruthless. It show that there is some good in him, for doing the right thing. Also in this book, Professor Xavier's dark side is seen. Even if not voluntarily. This is the type of book that anyone, whether or not an X-Men fan, can see the meaning to."
4,A Bit of Our World in a Fantasy,"This book plays wonderfully on the one thing that unites Charles Xavier and Magneto - their love for their fellow mutants. A right-wing extremist believes that Xavier is the anti-Christ, and his phrases only too often remind us of similar personages in America. The philosphy and theory is supported by necessary action, not the other way around as is the case in so many lower quality comic books. Overall, an excellent work."
4,Not bad,"The problem with this books is theres no actual repurcussions. It had all the makings of the greatest X-Men story ever told, and comes close to succeeding, but never quite attains the pure emotion that it could if not for poor coincidences and good luck,"
3,Lego Garbage Truck,"Techically impressive, the truck is rather fragile when built and complicated to put together when it falls to pieces. Not up to Legos usual standard."
5,Overpriced.,"$14.99 direct from Lego, or at any other store. Twice the price plus shipping here? What gives?"
2,nice to look at,"This garbage truck was fun to put together but forget about playing with it. It has a lot of cool features that my grandsons(4 & 5 years old) wanted to play with but even when I would handle the truck, the pieces would come apart very easily. It became so frustrating that I decided to put it away and search for a better model truck for them. Maybe the Duplo Lego one would be one to look into. We have loved all the other Lego sets especially the Kings Castle series."
4,Yeah for Trash Trucks!,"This was our first ""big boy"" lego set and my son is only three but loves trash trucks. Of course he needed help building it and his attention span didn't quite last the duration of the building project. Even when he's careful with it there are a few sections that continuously fall off, so there is a lot of maintenance involved. Still a great lego set though and I'm sure he'll enjoy it for a few more years!"
5,Goes together Nicely,"I bought this for my six year old grandson and I to do together when he came for his sleepover. To quote Elijah while we were playing, ""This is going together very nicely"". We chose to assemble it over two days, but it could be done in one sitting. The instructions were very easy to follow. He probably could have done it without me, but it was fun to do together too. I thought the price was good, the value was top notch"
4,Lego Garbage/Recycle Truck,"Good instructions, was built together w/my 5 year old. He plays with it often and likes shoveling the bits and putting them in the can and dumping into the truck. Only complaint is a very weak spot in the legos where the back end lifts up, constantly breaks off and was frustrating. Bought superglue for that specific area where the henge and the backend lifts. Overall, nice lego kit w/opportunity to talk about recycling and litter."
5,Excellent product,"I've used this product to bake pies and cakes in the oven, and to reheat leftovers in the microwave. It works very well at all tasks. The product looks nice, so wouldn't be out of place on a dining table and is of good quality. It washes without any problems in the dishwasher, and the plastic lids fits very well and is a great way to preserve food. The size is just perfect for making meals for two people. I am very happy with my purchase, and will no doubt be buying another one of these products at some point in the future."
3,"Useful, but",It is a good size dish but each time I use it I regret that the lid isn't glass. That would increase its versatility greatly.
4,Elegant serving dish,Of all my French White dishes I use this one the most. Would rate it 5 stars but it doesn't come with a glass lid for baking.
5,CorningWare 24-Ounce Round Dish,"CorningWare is a good quality product to start with. This product is great for storing and heating lunches, excellent way to save money."
4,I will buy more !,"These are a great size for a ""cooking for two"" household. I can make casserole recipes and easily freeze in more usable size and not have a lot of leftovers."
5,Reliable cookware,Unfortunately we broke one of our Corningware casserole dishes over Thanksgiving. I looked on Amazon and found a great variety to chose from. I like this one for cooking and for reheating. I love having a lid that fits it so well.
5,Great Binoculars,"The binoculars themselves are great for astronomy, and are available at an extremely good price. They have allowed me to look at so many objects in the night sky. The binoculars are especially nice if you are new to astronomy, because they will easily introduce you to the best that the night sky offers."
2,"Optics are fine, but alignment was terrible","Optically, these binoculars are very nice. However, the pair I got suffers from a horrible misalignment that makes me have to tilt them to one side almost to where I can't see through one eye-hole in order for the image to line up properly. If I look straight, I see two images at an odd diagonal.Related note: makes a fantastic monocular."
5,Quality product,"I bought this product specifically for stargazing. By holding these in my hands I can tell that these binoculars are high quality. Great price.The only thing I would recommend is that if you don't have the steady hands of a professional photographer, that you buy yourself a tripod because (for me) it is very difficult to hold them steady enough to actually enjoy what I'm looking at. This isn't the products fault at all... anything else with this level of magnification would be difficult to hold steady... unless it was some kind of automated device like an electronic telescope."
2,B ig bulky and not as good as some smaller ones,These might be good for use with a tripod but without it's nothing but shake city...they are virtually useless. The optics are poor AND We got another pair much smaller and much better quality optics that make these huge ones look like junk. NOT recommended
3,Celestron 15x70 binoculars,"OK, but not as good as advertised. More blurred vision around the outer sides than expected."
5,Cheap and worth it...,"... a decent pair of 15x70 binoculars is EXPENSIVE. These were about $65, including a case and an adapter for a camera tripod. Not the greatest optics, but I've got them sitting in my office window, where they're just excellent for looking at the boats outside. (I really want a pair of US Navy ""big eyes"" but those are just outrageous.)The tripod adapter should be metal - the thing is plastic, and a bit flimsy given the mass of the binoculars. If I tweak it hard, it will probably snap. In installation instructions are a bit hazy; you have to be brave and pop that cap off the outer end of the shaft to mount the adapter."
4,Good value,"I am a bird watcher and appreciate having a nice set of binoculars to check in on things in the woods out my back door. These are very nice for the price. Range is a little narrow - not the binoculars' fault - which takes some getting used to and the ""strap"" is not really a real strap...more an afterthought. All that being said, they mounted easily on my tripod and are easy to adjust and focus. A nice buy for the money."
3,heavy!,"these were decently priced and are so much better for viewing than my previous binoculars, but they are quite heavy, which results in too much hand shaking and trouble maintaining the view. i guess i'll have to use them with a tripod."
3,Celestron Binoculars,"First of all I like the binoculars for their optics and star gazing. However, the ability to attach it to a tripod is unclear at best. There is no manual included and I could not find one online. While the binoculars are excellent the adaptor was a deciding factor with my purchase so I am disappointed in this area."
2,Quality Problems,I found that the binoculars were out of collimation and returned them to Amazon and requested a replacement pair. I received the replacement and found that the collimation was even worse than I had experienced with the first pair. I requested another replacement. Amazon sent me an Email that stated that the problems they are having with these binoculars are greater than they realized and that they would be sending me a refund rather than another replacement. I am very impressed with the way Amazon has handled this. They sent me the replacement pair even before I had returned the defective pair. They even covered all of the return postage. I will definately continue to purchase from Amazon.
3,Excellent if you get a good pair,"I ordered 8 of these for my astronomy class. Of the original 8, 3 were out of collimation. I sent those back and of the 3 new ones I received, 1 was out of collimation. I sent those back but Amazon was unwilling to send me another pair, i just got a refund. So I will have to reorder the last pair. These are good binos when you get a well-collimated pair, but you have to be willing to test them. The tripod adapter is crap however. I will have to buy replacements that help dampen the oscillation faster. But overall I like these binos and my students are impressed when they use them."
2,binoculars 15x70mm.,These are worthless for Astronomical use as the manufacture used a CHEAP tripod mount that renders the binoculars useless for sky viewing.There is no way to steady them. Their next model up 20x80 has a great mount that is used by several other companies. I return these & purchased a 20x80mm one made by Berska which has the better mount. I got them at a great price. $99. from amazon and they work great! I recommend Barska ones instead & save some money.
5,A Good Deal,"These are a good deal considering the size of the objective lenses and the amount of light they gather. They are easy to handle and are not as heavy as they look. I used them to observe some large birds in flight and to observe some southern sky objects and was delighted in what I saw. I did have to tweek the collimation when I got them, but that was easily done and I look forward to using them more."
5,Great Tool for Astronomy On-the-Go,"These are great for those of us who are interested in astronomy, but don't want to drag a telescope around with us all the time. They don't take up much space, the view is excellent, and the price is right. I would recommend getting a stand for them though, as they can be a bit difficult to keep steady after holding them for a while."
3,Poor quality,"Los binoculares excelentes, cuando le iba instalar el trípode , los lentes se desajustaron . Y como estoy en Colombia la garantía no me la cubre"
5,I Spy,"These are really powerful and really clear, they are the best entry level glasses I have even come across. Buy These!"
4,Binoculars are sturdy and quite excellent,Binoculars were a good value and were bought for sports and concert usage. I was quite happy with the quality of the view thought the glasses and more happy with the price. Binoculars are sturdy and quite excellent for the price paid. The power is adequate for the usage bought for and would recommend them for all round general use.
5,Great Buy,"Pros: Great Price, Great ProductCons: The tripod adapter could be better (does the job, but allows for some shake)"
1,Poor Optics Quality,"I wasn't lucky with this binoculars and sent them back for a return. Left side remains soft and can't come in focus (yes, I tried to focus both sides with the same eye). It also has a highly pronounced color fringe around objects (a.k.a. chromatic aberration). The right side is fine. Perhaps this item was meant as a monocular :-)Since the price is very attractive (as most reviews point out) I will order another one and hope for better luck."
3,Binoculars are good; Tripod adapter terrible.,"I am pleased with these binoculars. I have been using them mainly for viewing astronomical objects such as double stars, stellar clusters, galaxies, etc. For the price, they have done what I wanted them to do. However, the tripod adapter is made of plastic and oscillates whenever touched. This means that you cannot come into contact with the binoculars while viewing or you will have to wait until the oscillations are dampened over time. The adapter should have been made of metal."
2,Underwhelming,"I'm not happy with mine. They suffer from ghosting when I view planets. Only the center 2/3ds of the field of view is relatively clear (except for the ghosting). These are cheap binoculars, and you would be better served spending a little more and getting a lot more binocular."
1,Read review by M. M. Vance...horrible binoculars,"I bought these binoculars because of the great reviews. Living in Costa Rica it is very difficult to return things or I certainly would. In addition to the knowledgeable review written by M.M. Vance regarding collimation (which make my binoculars worse than useless...they make you dizzy), I will add that the binoculars are extremely uncomfortable. The light shields around the eye pieces are very hard and don't flex into your eye socket. You can fold the shields out of the way, but then you can't block side light. The binoculars are heavy and basically useless without a tripod even if they weren't out of cullimation. The rubber protectors for both ends of the binoculars don't fit. The small protectors to cover the eye pieces don't even closely fit and you have to push them out of shape to make them ""fit"". The covers that protect the objective lens fall off if you just shake the binoculars lightly in your hands. Not a good purchase at any price!"
1,What a bust!!,"The binoculars arrived with collimation problems. Still, allowing for the slight double vision, I expected to have at least a clear view, but the darn things were not as clear as my cheap-o Tasco's. Like looking through haze. The one star was for Amazon's great return policy. I give these things a -1! They would make a great boat anchor. These reviews giving these binoculars high praise must be from a bunch of drunks!!"
3,"Good View, but Shaky","Easy to use, very good view of the Moon. Can see 4 moons of Jupiter. 1 moon of Saturn. However binoculars shake even when on a tripod,when my face nudges them or I touch them with my hands. The shake makes it difficult to get the satisfaction of observing things for some time..."
3,only half order shipped,only binaculars were shipped. tripod didn't come and co. had to be contacted. they said they sent 2 e-mails advising us. we received none.finally shipped and was a month late. don't appreciate being lied to.
3,not quite what i expected,this is not a high quality item as it seems to bei bought it to look at starsand it is not good at that at allnothing is sharp focusthere may be a way to make it better as some say they havei will try thoes ideas laterall in all at full price it was a big bust\but at the sale priceyes i can look at birds somebut i can not see the holes in a target at 100 yds as i hopedno i do not recomend buying thisand i would not again
3,I think ours was built in a hurry.,"When we bought these, we had no idea it would take 2 weeks before they would get shipped, once shipped, we got our in just days, BUT, the left lens had dust on the inside barrel and on the inside of the lens (with some smearing taboot). There was some green fringing at all ranges of use and this horrible ability to make us go cross eyed, BUT, for 15x and 70mm lenses, they do quiet well in most lighting situations, after your eyes come to terms with them that is. I personally think the manufacture was in a hurry to build these and skimped on the usual quality control, or, the company is simply going down hill, but I rather give them the benefit of the doubt and we just got a beat up pair."
1,Poor design,"The first time I picked them up, the eye pieces fell off, in my hand. With only a one page manual, there are no instructions on how to re-install them. Made in China, big surprise. I returned them for refund."
4,pretty good set,I bought two pair of these binoculars for my grandkids to use at our house out in the woods. They are a pretty good set for the money and they also include the neck strap and a carrying case.
4,nice and relatively inexpensive,"Optical rendition is good, with only the slightest outside edges being fuzzy. These are big, and a bit heavy. FOV is adaquate for observing wildlife and nature. Price is just right."
5,what?,"Really impressed. Bought them because a friend had a pair and because of the power over my 10x50s. Easy to focus, bright and clear and could almost watch the ticks crawl on a deer's back at 100 yards."
2,Out of Collimation - Double images on both axis,"Item arrived quickly and in good condition, but unfortunately I too have double images...vertically and horizontally. That's too bad, since the binoculars look great and feel great in the hands. The eye relief is quite nice too. Amazon is great with the refund and return pick-up as usual, so I'm reordering to see if I will have better luck on the next draw."
4,GREAT BINOCULARS,Ordered on 11-22-11 and they arrived within a week. Binoculars were exactly as described. They work GREAT though a little on the heavy side. Just use the tripod adapter and you can use them for hours. Great price for a really good product.
5,Daughter loves them!!,My daughter loves them!!! We can see craters in the moon! Excellent fun learning toy. I would recommend them for sure.
5,Cosmic Deal,"With these binoculars I've seen the Andromeda galaxy, Jupiter and it's four Galilean moons, the Orion nebula, etc. They're great for bird watching too. For 60 bucks you can't go wrong with these-- as long as you get a tripod. Stabilizing them by hand is very difficult."
5,They are great,I purchased these several months ago and they work great.The price is ridiculously affordable.You pay a little and get high end like optics.I use them mostly for terrestrial viewing and am very happy with them.Field of vision is great.
4,Good value for its price.,"The lens caps are kind of flimsy and feel like they're cheaply made. The rubber material used as the outer shell for the binoculars sort of makes them feel like toy binoculars as well.Nonetheless, they work GREAT! The magnification is mind blowing and the focus is very crisp. In terms of usability, this is exactly what I wanted. For a good price, too."
3,Bargain binoculars,"A decent long distance viewing binocular at a great price. The brightness and clarity, for a $60 pair of binoculars, is satisfactory. These are a little heavier than you'd like but I have no problem with using them for short viewing. But I'm glad I did buy a tripod for extended/sky viewing."
4,Amazon has incorrect specs.,"Please be advised that while Amazon says this product weighs 1.5 lbs., the Celestron website lists it at 48 oz. (3 lbs.) Best to compare specs there. (I have not used this product. Ignore the rating.)"
5,WELL WORTH THE MONEY.,"I TRYED THIS BINOS UP CLOSE AS WELL AS FAR OFF AND THE VIEW IS VERY CLEAR EITHER WAY. A TRIPOD WOULD BE HELPFULL, BUT ALSO WORKS WELL HAND HELD.ALL IN ALL, I LOVE THIS BINOS."
4,These things are great!,I just bought the celestron 15x70 last week and they are great. they arrived yesterday and i took them out that night. on the first night i saw two galexies and the nebulae in orion. They have good optics but are a little difficult to focus. The only down side really is that they are a little heavy and need a tripod but other than that they are great for other amatuer astronomers.
1,Double Image,"I was attracted to these binoculars by the number of encouraging reviews and by the low price. I should know by now that you get what you pay for. I took them outside the first night for a look at the moons of Jupiter expecting a spectacular view and got a double image of Jupiter that I could not resolve no matter how much focusing and rotating of the binoculars I did.Very disappointing after so much expectation.I thought Celestron would have had better quality control on products they put their name on. Amazon is tops though because the took them back with not a problem. My standard binoculars are Canon 10x30, image stabilized, that give a very clear view. The moons of Jupiter are easily resolved. Stick with quality optics.Canon 10x30 Image Stabilization Binoculars w/Case, Neck Strap & Batteries"
1,Strike Two,"Beware of these binoculars, I have had the same experience that G. Roche had on page 2. The first pair came and were out of collimation so I filled out an RMA request form and sent them back. They sent me a second pair and it was worse than the first. You would think they would at least inspect them for that problem before they send the second pair out...right? Not to mention the cost of freight. So here I sit with a second pair of binoculars that don't work and if I do send them back and pay the freight again, I will for sure get back another pair with the same problem. I could have spent the same amount of money once you include the freight twice and gotten a better pair of binoculars. I will tell you this, I am NOT buying another pair over the internet. I will go to the store and try them out before I purchase again."
2,very disappointed,I do not know if the pair I have are defective or what. I use them primarily to look at objects in the ocean. The images lack clarity and the diopters are difficult to get into focus. I have a pair of 7x50 Tascos that are far superior in clarity and power. If it were not for the kindness of amazon's refund policy I would have been totally stuck
5,Totally worth it!!,"This is the most perfect pair of binoculars anyone who is just starting out with star gazing can hope for. The 70 mm lens makes the moon a magnificent sight. Although I only recently got it, I have been able to see the Orion Nebula in surprisingly reasonable detail. A few days ago I was able to see Jupiter and 4 of its moons. The best part of the binoculars is that it is ready to use out of the box. I do recommend a tripod to get a stable image (I just ordered one :) ). I am just starting out with amateur astronomy and I could not have hoped for an easier to use instrument. Oh, I live in the city with a lot of light pollution, and everything I observed was under these conditions."
3,Celestron 15x70 binoculars,"The optics are truly amazing for the price. The field is wide, the image is bright, razor sharp and with fine contrast and color rendition. My complaint is with the center focusing mechanism which tends to drift and requires constant attention. This problem could have been easily fixed at the factory with a properly sized washer to take out the play in the center focusing knob. I hope Celestron gets the message and takes the last small step to make these binoculars just right."
5,Nice All Around Binos,"I took these out to some dark skies recently and they were increadible, stars looked like i could touch them, crisp pinpoint stars all around. These were easy to use will laying on my back, however, i must say while standing or sitting up a tripod is recommended to steady the view as they are heavy for hand held observing. I picked up a sturdy but inexpensive tripod with use with these binos which has made it possible to use for birding or bison watching in Yellowstone. The price is terrific i could not find them any cheaper but plenty out there way more expensive. Get these and with the saved cash pick up a tripod and you will be on your way to some great viewing."
4,Bang for the buck!,"Pros:- BAK4 prism provides crisp and clear images- tripod adaptable- huge objectives- does what is it supposed to do- water-resistantCons:- Heavy, but this isn't one of the binoculars you'd bring to a stadium or for hiking- Needs tripod for image stability; comes with tripod adapter, so this issue is null- Neck strap is pretty much non-usable since the weight of binoculars actually put pressure on the back of your neck. You would use a tripod most of the time, so this is also null- Crappy carrying bag with strap, but nonetheless a bagThe relative:- If you get this make sure you have a sturdy tripodNote- I was able to make out the shape of Jupiter and see several of its moon with no difficulty."
4,Celestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars w/Tripod Adapter,"Very good optics. A bit heavy, but worth every extra ounce. The tripod adapter is pretty cheesy, but does work.Recommend for anyone looking toward the heavens."
5,Great binoculars!,"These binoculars are INCREDIBLE!!! You can actually see the craters on the moon!!! A bit heavy but with a heavy duty tripod, it does the job!"
5,You cannot beat this deal,Wonderful bino's for the price. You will spend as much if not more for a sturdy tripod. A tripod should be rated for at least 11 lbs. Higher magnification and weight makes a tripod neccessary.
3,Not a bad product but ended up returning them,"I purchased these as a gift for myself, but I ended up returning them. I was having problems focusing them. They also were quite heavy to hold for more than 5 minutes, and I was looking for something that I could really stargaze with for a longer length of time. And I also returned them because they just didn't quite give the views/magnification I was looking for, which I didn't realize until trying to use them. That all being said, they were clearly a good product and not a waste of money. Just not what I was looking for."
1,Now I know why they are on SALE!,I bought a pair of Celestron binoculars and they were defective so I sent them back for a replacement and the second pair was doing the same thing as the first pair. The binoculars flair the planets as you look through them. I also found out I am not the only one having problems with these binoculars others are also.
2,Not for stargazing,"This isn't the pair of binoculars you want for star gazing. Yes, the optics are great considering the price but they are so cheaply constructed that the smallest bump will knock them out of collimation. They arrived in perfect condition, but after a couple of months they started giving double images when star gazing (and yes, I know how to adjust them).I can't really recommed these because I have a pair of 10x50's that are the same price, a lot more compact, lighter, and they give way better views.Except for a spotting scope everything else I bought from Celestron has been substandard."
3,Celestron Giant Binoculars,The only thing I'd like see improved is to make it easier to focus. I have another pair of less powerful ones that have a lever you push up and down on to focus. On the Giant ones you have to rotate a wheel.
5,Great Bimoculars,"These are great, easyer than dragging out the telescope.. but to take full advantage of them ,should have a tripod.."
2,Nice If It Were All Collimated,"Got mine yesterday. Nice multicoatings on the objective oenses, but the eye lenses were just single-coating mfg2. No idea about the prisms. I immediately took them outside to check and found the left ocular to be excellent - but the right ocular would not come to focus. Checking from the objective side, I could see that it was not collimated (in this case, the prism were not correctly oriented) and I could see the cutoff when looking directly into the lens at the center. UPS is picking them up today for a return (refund only, no exchange allowed). Too bad, as they are pretty lightweight and hand-holdable, especially if you are sitting or leaning against something."
3,TOO BIG BUT GOOD ZOOM,"when i opened the box i was surprised . I thought it is not my package because it is too big .but it is efficient with great zoom .sometimes there is difficulties in image stabilization but still amazing regarding it's pricedo more , spend lessthanks"
3,quite pleased,I was quite pleased with my purchase. It was a gift and my husband was happy with the item. Your selection was great and I was happy with my purchase. I will purchase products from you in the future!
1,Completely unusable,Bought these hoping they would be my first much closer look at the stars and the moon on my own. Received them and while they were well packaged I was thoroughly disappointed in what I saw in the view. I saw two moons! I couldn't believe my eyes. I broke out the instructions and nothing was mentioned how to converge the separate moons. I tried again the next night thinking perhaps by magic things were not the way they appeared the first night but they were identical with duplicate images. I decided to return them and Amazon will provide a refund.
2,LOW QUALITY BINOCULAR,"I RECEIVED THE 15X70'S, AND RIGHT AWAY NOTICED THEY FELT VERY LIGHT( PLASTIC BODY?), COMPARED TO MY OLDER 11X80 UNITRON BINOS. ANYWAY AFTER TAKING THEM OUT SIDE TO TEST THE OPTICS, I NOTICED SHADOWS OF DIRT/DUST SPECKS IN THE IMAGES. BACK INSIDE, UNDER A LAMP,I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DUST, DIRT, AND EVEN HAIRS, THAT WERE INSIDE OF THE LENS, BOTH EYEPIECES, AND BOTH OBJECTIVES! THERE IS EVEN SOME SMALL SMUDGE MARKS ON THE INSIDE OF THE OBJECTIVES.ALSO THE PLASTIC TRIPOD ADAPTER TO MOUNT THE BINOS ON A TRIPOD IS USELESS. IT VIBRATES LIKE IT WAS MADE OF RUBBER, AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH. PURCHASERS SHOULD BUY A METAL ADAPTER.I HAVE BOUGHT MANY CELESTRON PRODUCTS IN THE PAST, INCUDING C6, AND C8 TELESCOPES, AND USED TO BE HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY... NOT SO SURE NOW.I CAN'T BELIEVE CELESTRON QUALITY CONTROL HAS LET SOMETHING LIKE THESE PASS.ANYWAY, IN ALL FAIRNESS, THEY WERE ONLY $50.00, AND HAVE FAIRLY SHARP, BRIGHT, WIDE, FIELDS OF VIEW. IF YOU CAN LOOK OVER THE DUST SHADOWS."
2,Good value - but not for astronomy,"A low end unit with very poor edge correction and transmission but perfectly good for terrestrial use. Not recommended for astronomy. Actualy a reasonable value for the (low) price, just not a quality item."
4,Celestron 15x70,"Service was great. Had some great evenings to observe the planets and moon. Jupiter was clear in the South East sky. The binoculars were able to see all four major moons of Jupiter. They allow you to see stars that you cannot see with the naked eye. Would recommend a steady service to brace your elbows for a more shakey free view. They are not heavy, and very easy to hold for extended time. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,almost perfect,This is a wonderful scope. This is almost as good as my telescope but easier to use. Only downfall was the tripod adapter snapped the first time I used it. Hopefully I can replace the adapter.
5,Cheap but still a bargain,"I got mine for $54 and I have to say Amazon got it to me in record time. Out of the box they are not really impressive. Included with the Skymaster is a Tripod mount, rubber ""slip on"" lens covers, a cheesy little neck strap and a velcroed bag with a pretty good strap on it.First impressions are good. I am pleased with the sharpness although it never quite gets razor sharp like my camera lenses but still, for the money, this is an excellent pair of beater binoculars. I bought these to use for a spotting scope for range shooting. The Tripod mount is a bit wobbly and annoying for the constant jiggling while you try to use ""hands free"" but for the price, this is the best deal on amazon."
5,Great pair of binoculars for an outstanding price!,"I had purchased a pair of these for myself back in September and loved them enough to buy another pair as a gift for my father in-law. I've used mine for sighting target practice, star gazing, and just peering across the lake I live on. I do use a tripod when star gazing and have been able to see the moons of Jupiter (i think) which is pretty cool. I doubt you can beat the price/quality ratio anywhere."
4,Great buy,"These binoculars are well worth the money and Amazon had the best price on the web. If you want something more versatile that a scope these will fit the bill. You will need a sturdy tripod, lightwieght tripod won't get the job done.."
2,"Good light and distance, but unbalanced","These have a great range of distance and allow enough light for what would be a clear image, however, the lenses (at least in the ones I received) are vertically off. There is a horizontal adjustment, but not vertical, so everything appears to have a double vertically. It appears as if the lenses have been twisted, bent or just improperly put together. Pretty disappointed in this product."
1,Skymasters,"Nice views, but, the two views are out of alignment... So pretty worthless for me. Nice if you close an eye, but, they are binoculars. So, no good for me I'm afraid."
5,Wow!,Great product! I was able to see a sign a mile down the road as clearly as if it were right outside my window. Great for the starting stargazer or someone who wants to see wildlife at a distance.
5,Great binoculars for the amateur astronomer,"Many new amateur astronomers are anxious to buy their first telescope prior to learning the skies. These Celestron binoculars are a great medium for that task and an incredible value. Beware, however, they are quite heavy and for any kind of sustained use require a tripod for effective utilization. They come with a soft carrying case and a tripod attachment device. If you do not have a tripod or don't want to use one, I would highly recommend a smaller pair of binoculars."
3,"Nice Binoculars, Terrible Tripod Adapter.","These binoculars are big, weigh 4 pounds, have lots of magnification and a narrow field of view. They are not something to just carry with you to a football game. They are nice for astronomy, giving good light grasp for very low cost.The main problem is the tripod adaptor, which is plastic and has no lateral bracing.Binoculars with more than 10x magnification cannot be held steady by hand. You must have a tripod and attach them to it. Therefore, the adaptor is CRITICAL, and this one is all but useless. If I so much as touch my nose to the side of one of the eyepieces, these binoculars begin to oscillate from side to side, taking maybe 10 seconds to die out.I'm going to have to find an aftermarket adapter for this product."
5,Better than expected,"The other reviews have captured everything so I won't waste your time. Here's a newbie amateur astronomer perspective:* They arrived in perfect condition and have provided me hours of fantastic views of the moon, planets, stars, clusters, nebulae and galaxies.* Thanks to excellent light-gathering, you don't need pitch-black skies.* The weight (5 pounds) and high magnification (15x) restricts the field of view (4.4 degrees) and makes the view shaky so you need a really good tripod.* Excellent eye relief ensures that you can use them with spectacles.* I don't know how good/bad the tripod adapter is because mine was missing.* No, you won't see what the Hubble telescope sees.* Yes, I would buy another one in a heartbeat if I had to!"
1,Poor Optics Allignment,"We ordered these binocs after reading the reviews and hoped the optics would be good. However, the allignment is off--we see double of everything. Returning for another pair...."
3,An Honest Review,"This is a true, honest review, which you won't find at the manufacturer's' site as they don't post even constructive criticism.So here goes:Pro: Great for earth views, especially for the price. I saw some amazing long distance bird views with these.Con: Totally useless plastic tripod adapter wobbles all over the place making the binos ineffective for astronomy until you buy a new metal adapter for minimum $25. Also these binos, like many others, suffer from chromatic aberration (a red halo around objects) when viewing bright planets.Verdict -- great for earth (with new adapter), virtually useless for astronomy if planets are primary interest. With new adapter, however, you will get awesome moon and star views."
2,"Good, if you can get a pair that is collimated",I went through two pairs both of which arrived out of collimation. The images couldn't merge. Finally I got a cash refund and bought a pair for $40 more at Garret optical. They are super.
1,Poor Quality Control,"I went through two pair. The first pair that I recieved were broken. The left eye-piece was completely separated from the focuser. The replacement pair had a serious double imaging problem. At this point, I plan to try a different brand. I won't go back to Celestron. I will say that the order handling was excellent. The first pair arrived early and the replacement pair was delivered two days after I requested them. It's too bad that such great service was ruined by such poor quality merchandise."
3,not 5 stars,"it does not deserve 5 stars for sure. It is cheap and it is what you get. Yes, the tripod adapter is crap but the trick with epoxy works well. The image is big but defintely not sharp. I can see more detail with quality 8x42 binocs with ED glass than these binocs. They also suffer from chromatic aberration a lot. But if you decided to but they give you lot of fun watching the stars. IMHO the best thing to do is to save some money, work harder and buy Fuji instead."
5,Best deal on the planet,"I just purchsed the Infinity PRIMUSHCSCH Home Theater Pack of speakers. Look at (professional) reviews of the Infinity Primus speakers and you'll see these speakers were created for musicality first, although home theater sounds great, too. I first and foremost want a system that sounds tight and clear playing at all registers. This system delivers in all respects. It includes 4 Primus 140 bookshelf/sattelites and one center speaker as well as the sub (PS-8). I love the timbre of an upright bass more than the shaking of the floor in a movie explosion, and this sub is phenomenal at both. This package without the sub sells around $300, but look for the one with sub included and you will be blown away by the sound and the price."
2,Guts went out of the series of books,"Characterization weaker than the first 3 novels of the series.White Queen an elusive, almost evanescent character that inconvincingly appears out of nowhere. Really weak ""Grace exMachina"" ending, after a gripping Eric Ambler (for a few pages)build up. This is the first Douglass series I've read and , despite the gripping first three novels, it will be the last.Pathetic blending of GVI, Faerie Domain and history of the Blitz, and of the first 3 superior episodes of course.History of the Blitz may be accurate, but no connection with the Battle of Britain, weakens impact on The Land."
4,Druids Sword,"The final installment of The Troy Game is another Sara Douglas great yarn,I have been looking forward to this book for a long time,and I really did enjoy it. Sara put a fitting end to this long an very enjoyable saga!"
2,A WASTE OF MONEY,"OMG!!! What a load of crap. I waited until this book came out in paperback, partly because I was being cheap and partly because I read the reviews, and I am so glad that I did. If I brought this hard cover I would have been so much more upset. The last 3 books were great, I loved them and could not wait for the conclusion, however this book ran like a bad soap opera. There were so many times that I wanted to put it down, burn it, anything to get it away from me, however I am one of those people who once I have started a book I have to see it through to the bitter end. This is one time that I cursed this shortcoming. I am so disappointed in this book, I am disappointed in the conclusion, Ms Douglass has always leaned towards the sopa opera side in her books, but this book went way overboard. Borrow this book from the library, save your money because you are going to need some asprin after banging your head into the walls from frustration."
