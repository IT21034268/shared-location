2,Poorly Manufactured Product,"My dryer vent hasn't been keeping out the cold air as well as I would like and being energy conscious, I decided to try this product. The idea of it seems to be very good. In other words the engineering is fine. However the material is just okay (thinner and more brittle than other plastic vents on my home) and the manufacturing quality is poor. There are gaps between the seams where the various molded pieces are assembled that will let in water and air. I am debating whether to try and patch this unit myself or simply toss it in the trash bin. Right now it is sitting in the basement awaiting disposition. I do commend the seller for prompt delivery."
3,Work well but are fragile,Perhaps mine wasn't installed right but the top came off in a storm and is slightly cracked. It seems like a great product otherwise.
4,Best solution on the market,"My husband installed this dryer vent to replace the original 20 year old vent on our house. We're constantly making improvements to the house for improved energy efficiency, so we can't really say anything about energy savings from this dryer vent.Our perception, though, is that we don't feel drafts in the laundry room anymore. Big improvement.More significantly, since it doesn't hang open like the original vent, there is no way for critters to find their way inside the house. That's exactly what happened to some friends of ours and what will never happen to us with this dryer vent installed.Visually, the vent is BIG, but you get used to it. If it really bothers you, plant a shrub!Bottom line: I'm pleased to have a vent that doesn't allow airflow in/out of the house. I'm pleased to have a vent that doesn't allow small animals and/or birds into the house. It only took a few minutes to install with standard tools and some siding caulk."
4,Good product. Excellent value.,"Old dryer vent allowed cold air to enter house.Installation was quick and easy.If you don't have this style dryer vent, you should!"
4,Dryer vent,It fits very well. Easy to install and works exactly as advertised. this is the second one I have had.
5,Great replacement,The big box stores like to force you to purchase new items. When you find a great item that works for you stay with it.The color also matches my trim.
5,Dryer Vent,Like the vent because it keeps the air from coming into the house. It is easy to clean and looks good.
1,flimsy,"The product has potential but it is too flimsy in excution. The lightweight plastic separated along the elbow seam as I installed a 4"" aluminum dryer vent extension. The extension was itself lightweight. Very disappointing. Now I suspect the product wouldn't stand up to normal usage. It's lightweight material may become soft with heat and it will not stand the impact of accidental household usage, soccer balls, bumps from ladders, kid's playing - that type of thing. Together with shipping charges, this is something to avoid."
3,Poor Construction,First I'll qualify myself as a Mechanical Engineer. I demand quality in everything I purchase.I was very disappointed when I opened the box to find that this product is made of a very hard plastic. Which makes me think that it will be very easy to damage by cracking. I did not see if this material was UV resistant.I did spray paint it to match my vinyl siding. The paint did adhere with no problem.Only time will tell how long this item will last.
5,Great Price on dryer vent closure,Great price for the dryer vent closure and you don't have to worry about cold air coming into the house
5,What a difference!,"I installed this thing this past weekend, and it's already made a huge difference. This morning, when I went downstairs, it wasn't freezing at all, and this was on a morning that was 25 degrees! We also don't have that annoying draft anymore. What a great product!"
3,"Great idea, but quality is poor",I purchased two of the Lambro 289W Dryer Vents. I like the idea and it should work well except that the plastic cylindrical cap inside that slides up and down to seal the air is deformed and sticks so the seal doesn't close. I've emailed Lambro for a replacement seal - we'll see how they respond. I wonder if the Heartland 21000 is better or the same - they sure look the same.
1,Terrible Quality from Battic Door Energy Conservation Products,"This was to replace the 'same' unit I originally bought at Lowe's. The unit when it arrived was half the weight of the sturdy ABS plastic of the original model. When I inspected the unit it had no instructions other that the minimal ones on the flimsy box.When I opened the top (lint trap door) to examine the float (which is made of an even lighter cheaper plastic, unlike the original which was made of the same durable ABS), the hinges promptly snapped.This is a terrible, cheap, poorly made knock-off of the original high quality, well designed orignal. Don't waste your money here, find the original, should be more like 5 pounds, not 2 pounds.Super-Efficient Dryer Vent Saves You up to 10% on Energy Costs"
3,"Lambro 4"" Dryer Vent Seal","I think the Lambro Dry Vent Seal is a good solution, but there is a much less costly, more elegant solution available. It is the Jundas-Jafine wafer-type butterfly valve that is installed in any 4"" diameter dryer vent. It is available from Lowes for $3.97 plus tax (November 2009). It probably creates less back pressure resistance to forward air flow than the Lambro does."
4,Excellent product!,This is the second one of these I have owned. What I especially like is how well it keeps the cold air out of the dryer. It is much better than the products with flaps.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there was some mold flash I had to remove.
3,Dryer Vent,The product is OK but very flimsy and not anywhere as well made as similar products made ten years ago.
4,ok,"Overall it was about what I expected. The thing I was some concerned about was the plastic on plastic seal from inside cover to the main frame. I bought some thin sticky back door/window seal and placed under moving cover, on top of main output pipe. Does what I needed, block out cold as my out let is on North side."
2,Cool design but super poor in efficiency,"I've been solely involved with dryer venting for over 15 years. When I ran a Back Pressure test on these ""wiffle ball"" style vents I found them very high in the delta or additional back pressure they provided. The concept is great, and it performs the back flow preventer operation well, keeping the bugs out but the air has to make such an immediate 180 in such a small space. Weigh the benefits against the extra time the dryer will likely run. And always make a point to periodically inspect any termination for lint accumulation and sufficient air movement."
5,decent for the price,"Not sure what to say about the issues that others are seeing. Works as described, have opened the cap multiple times without any breakage or feeling like it's about to break. Great for keeping air and critters out when the dryer isn't in use. Hasn't discolored or built up lint.I sort of question the possibility of the cap restricting or stifling air flow and think maybe it should be shaped differently (conical underneath to direct air out instead of hollow which traps the air) but seems to work well and always seats back properly."
4,Great for 6th grade,This product was great it had many ideas on how to incorporate this into the classroom. It was very useful for group activities and reviewing the content my students had already learned! Great idea for warm ups in the classroom.
1,A rambling piece ...,"This book is very poorly written and organized. It is a rambling piece that covers a number of subjects other than the ""Duel in the Sun"" in a very disorganized manner. The commentary etc. of the actual ""Duel in the Sun"" comes along after about 2/3 of the book, and presents virtually nothing insightful."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I read an excerpt of this... it was enough to know I could live without reading more. Politically, I'm about as far left as you can get without putting pipe bombs in the tailpipes of SUV's. Others reading this review might be, too, and to them I say: go do something. Anything. But save yourself the time and braincells you'd lose by wading through this six-hundred pages of run-on sentences and modifiers. Apparently this guy has good friends who haven't worked up the nerve yet to honestly appraise his writing to his face."
1,Competitive Global management-Principles and strategies,"A subjective analysis notwithstanding the author's tremendous effort to churn out over 400 pages. The author would be best to discuss the subject from an objective perspective rather than an subjective or normative perspective.The comment by the anonymous collaborator on Ch. 11 probably be characterized as self-serving. With regard to the anonymous colloborator, if your name was prominently mentioned in Chapter 11, why then did you decide to remain anonymous in commenting this book! Sorry. This book is not worth the money I spent on it."
2,"Heavy on the valentine, light on the commissioner part","Most of this book consists of Vincent relaying very short and sweet stories about small incidents and moments in time. Particularly, he pays very much attention to retired players he met and coming to terms with the differences in public personas and actual personalities.I expected a far heavier treatment given the first half of the title. However, the opinions and issues are very skant throughout the book. There moments he gives opinions are often not substantiated and the depth of material is actually suited best for younger readers.I expected the opportunity to be taken to rationalize the role of the commissioner and outline a concrete argument about Vincent's experiences and how things could improve. Instead, the minor essays give a taste of the subject that most hardcore baseball fans would already know before reading."
4,Nice economical jasmine,"This is a nice jasmine tea, that doesn't get bitter if you forget it and steep it longer than 3-5 minutes (as I have done). There isn't a lot of jasmine aroma in the steam or the flavor, which is why I took a star off, but as an economical everyday jasmine tea it can't be beat. I liked it enough to order more."
4,ONE TUESDAY MORNING,I LOVE KAREN KINGSBURY AND RATED THIS A FOUR STAR ONLY BECAUSE THIS AND THE OTHER TWO BOOKS IN THE SERIES WERE CHRISTMAS GIFTS AND I HAVE NOT YET READ THEM. I'M SURE THEY WILL ALL BE GOOD JUST BECAUSE K. KINGSBURY WROTE THEM !!
3,One Tuesday Morning,"I love Karen Kingsbury and I enjoyed this book. It's not one of her best, but it is a great story. I have to say I had the ending figured out about half way through, but I was still interested enough to finish the book. Kingsbury did a great job of bringing the day of September 11th back to life. Everyone has a different story about that day and I think we can all relate to the pain and fear that you feel reading this story."
3,One Tuesday Morning,"The book arrived in good time, but I had ordered 2 books from this vendor at the same time - just in order to save postage, but they still sent the books separately, which I don't understand.The vendor was Hastings - both books were in good shape.Loved this book. Karen Kingsbury is an awesome Christian writer. She really inspires me."
4,Brought Back Memories,"This book truly brought back many memories of 9/11. The grief, fear and devastation that were wrought on that day were painful to most of us, but not near as painful as those that lost their loved ones. This book portrays that grief and hope, all mixed into a person's being. Karen Kingsbury was very tactful and realistic in her portrayal of the suffering of the victims' families and those around them. I had a hard time with the subject of the book, but it was well, written and a good read. I would recommend it and already have the second book in the sequence."
1,One Tuesday Morning,"Boring, unrealistic and duplicative. My book group recommended it and I couldn't even get through it. Obvious ending, ridiculous plot. Don't bother. Read Gods in Alabama for some entertainment."
5,Amazing,"I fell in love with Jake, Jamie, ans Sierra. It was an amazing book. I wish Jake didnt have to die but the pease he had was God hand at work. I couldnt stop crying. Way to go Karen 100 stars!!!!"
4,One Tuesday Morning,"A heartwrenching look at the grief associated with 9/11, and how God can pull us through that grief."
2,Not that great,"The last reviewer said that this had ""The hottest and most graphic girl on girl scenes I've ever seen on a GGW video."" That is total crap! Yes, it has 1 good scene, but almost all the rest is useless filler. They waste way too much time with girls that only flash for a few seconds. Why do they agree to be in the show if they don't want to get nude? It is such a waste when they have to spend the entire scene trying to get the girl to take her top off, and when she finally does, it stays off for 2 seconds. I have seen about 10 GGW dvds. This is true of almost all of them. The best GGW dvd I have seen is ""sexiest moments ever"". That one is great. I got it first and made the mistake of thinking they all would be that good. I should have been happy to have found it and not wasted any more money. All the rest are crap. I will not be buying them anymore."
3,If you like GGW and you like Asian Girls...,Then you should check out Wild Girls: Thailand! Hot Asian Chicks! Hot Beaches! etc. GGW with spicy Tom Yam Gung!Check it out!
4,POSTAGE DISGUSTING,"THE BOOK PURCHASED WAS FINE ALTHOUGH NO ONE SAID IT HAD WRITING INSIDE, SIGNATURES. THE BOOK WAS POSTED 11 MILES FROM WHERE I LIVE AND THE P&P CHARGE WAS 8.50 I THINK THIS IS DISGUSTING, WHEN I CONTACTED THE SELLER I WAS TOLD THAT AMAZON SET THE PRICE OF THE P&P. THIS IS AS BAD AS DEALING WITH EBAY AND PAYPAL, THEY ARE AFTER ALL THEY CAN GET FROM THE CUSTOMER. THIS IS HOW WE ARE BEING MILKED BY PEOPLE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY"
2,Cheap but very limited use for Subaru Outback,"To start, I have a 2011 Subaru Outback. I bought this to adapt my Thule setup (fork trays and a tandem mount) and found it to be a complete waste once things got heavier. Here is why: the cheap plastic risers do nothing more than create a second, narrower set of cross rails with a further reduced weight limit. I suppose if all you were racking were 2 ""good"" bikes (max 25-30 lbs. each) it would be acceptable (not box store 50lb. high tensile steel bikes). However, for serious racking on the newer Outbacks, leave the factory rails in their ""stored"" position and get yourself the Thule 450/50 or 450/58 system. Using the factory bars as side rails allows you to use more roof space and increased weight limit (for a cost of course). I can now easily rack my tandem as well as 2 kayaks or 4 Thule fork mount trays. The 532 would never have held up to a single kayak let alone my tandem."
2,This product is flimsy and only works with lighter items like bikes,"I have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee for which it is no longer possible to buy the Thule adapters to use with standard Thule products such as a bike rack or ski rack. I made the mistake of trying to use it with a Thule roll on kayak rack. And the weight of the boat almost bent the adapter rack over to the point of breaking. It's not strong enough to carry a kayak. That wasn't something that was made clear in the description of the product on Amazon.com. So if you want to use it to carry bicycles or skies, it may work for you, even if it is flimsy. Don't use it for heavier items."
4,Thule 532 Ride-On Bike Rack Adapter,"The 532 Ride-On Adapter is easy to install and made an inexpensive way to adapt older Thule bike trays to my 2012 Subaru Impreza factory crossbars. The 32 inch Thule bars that came with the 532 were too short so I substituted some 50 inch bars I had to enable me to mount the bike trays outside the stanchions and kayak stands in the middle. Caution: I would not carry two kayaks and two bikes at the same time, as this would overweight the factory bars."
1,Inadequate,"I ordered this product(3) at a cost of $15. because I have problems with floss breaking in my teeth and the need for Reach dentotape that will not break. When I received I opened one of the three and tried it. The result was that it shredded in my teeth. I returned two of the three to the shipper because the site indicated anything unopened could be returned if not satisfied.I have not received any credit for the two items nor have I heard from anyone regarding the issue. I am certain I will not receive a credit and had I known I would never hear from anyone, I would have kept the two and given them to others.I have learned a lesson which I will not forget. Do Not Order This type of Product Online!"
1,Reach Dentotape.,The product was fine. The shipping charges were more than the Dentotape. I won't order from this source again.
4,Good guide for cuturally diversity,This is a very nice bibliography for books about culturally diversity. It could be useful for us to see what kids needs to read to understand cultural differences in this country.
3,Meh,"It doesn't tingle, which is nice. I don't always want my skin to feel like it's on fire after I use a muscle rub. I don't know how well it works though. =/"
4,A great product,"After trying several other creams for sore muscles this stuff is far an above the rest (basically all icy hot by the ingredients). While other creams just leave me feeling greasy and tingly, while doing nothing about the deep throbbing ache, this stuff does wonders. It doesn't completely make sore and knotted up muscles release, but it certainly helps, if I use this stuff before I go to sleep (and sometimes I have to after working truck) the muscles have usually released in the morning. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is that it's a wax not a cream. Being so thick, it's really hard to cover large areas."
1,Another one in disguise,"How many of these so-called Drifters greatest hits album is the record industry going to come out with with non-standard, non-hit, ridiculous acoustic recordings of classic songs? The same question can be applied to the Platters, who also have had their classic songs foisted to the public on a bunch of greatest hits albums that feature pathetic cuts of songs of which the public wants to hear from the original performers! This Ben E. King and Drifters album is not nearly as bad as some of the other ones, but ""Stand by Me"" and ""There Goes My Baby""--and just about EVERY song on this album are not the versions that became hits--not the ones that MADE ME GET OUT OF BED TO GET THIS CD! The record industry is really ripping off its consumers with these stupid imitations!"
4,This CD will please all of those who are fans of Rock & Roll,"I don't know about other people, but I just can't manage to stay away from Rock & Roll. Now, today, with this Rap and Hip Hop junk, albums like this one aren't talked about anymore. But it should be. Songs like STAND BY ME, SPANISH HARLEM, and SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME make it terrific. This CD is one of the best Ben King albums out there right now, basically because it has the Drifters as well. This album couldn't possibly fail with the hits that it contains. However, there were some songs that I didn't like, but there were only a few, and the ones I did like certainly outweighed this. I heartily reccomend this album to all oldies lovers. It is like the rose in Spanish Harlem."
1,never got it,I purchased this book for a class and I have never recieved it. I ended up cheacking out a book in the library and making photocopies so I would have the material I needed for my class.
1,horrible,this product was cancelled on me...without any explanation the shipment was cancelled. even though i did get a refund i was dissappointed due to the fact that i need this book for school
1,Communication?,"I am very disappointed in this company. Even though I paid for expedited shipping, I did not receive the book until more than 2 weeks after I placed the order. Because of this, I had to purchase the same book at the college student store, as it was needed for a class. I have tried THREE times to contact the company to find out how to return the book and get reimbursed, and have not yet received an answer."
2,only an answer book not full text,this would be great if the algebra book it goes with was also offered but its not I didnt know from the description that it was a side by side for the other book
4,A completely fun time.,"Cactus Flower is a fun show. It drips with 1960s feel with the same sort of vintage appeal that Mad Men has. It has all sorts of humor in it from the sexual to the one liners to the clean to the physical. Abe Burrows knows comedy. The real treasure of the show is the supporting characters, who appear just long enough to make an impression. There's the devilishly obnoxious Harvey Greenfield, the hilarious cowardly South America Senor Sanchez, the rambunctious Mrs. Durant and the absent-minded Botticelli's Springtime. The main characters are wonderful too, especially Stephanie whose relationship with every single character is well-established by Burrows. Adam Sandler's ham-handed remake does not compare and this show is a must-read."
2,not yummy,"The kids didn't like it - nor did Mom and Dad. But we have very much liked other products by Cherrybrook Farm, so it was a bit of a surprise and disappointment."
4,great pancake mix,These pancakes turn out wonderfully. My only wish was that the price was slightly less - but probably just wishful thinking.
3,80% Interesting - 20% boring,"There are two major themes in this book, the activities of amateur astronomers as told in interviews, and a brief guide to the cosmos. I found the interviews fascinating, but they're interspersed with other chapters that seem to go on forever about details of astrophysics and what's happening in the stars. I guess you have to explain some of what these folks are looking at, but I found those sections boring. His portraits of real astronomers are very vivid however, although most get only a page or so."
1,Western intellectual corruption,"Restricting a sacred text like this to an intellectual western interpretation is killing the text itself. Jay Garfield uses Nagarjuna's text to boast his philosophical knowledge and scholarship, and strays far from what the original purpose of this work was. Misleading, confusing and confused: I read it in a beautiful island in Okinawa and still I found it depressing!"
5,Brian Regan,"Our family, of various ages, loves Brian Regan. His humor is clean and something that the common person can relate to. I think that's why he's so funny...you can easily say ""I've been there."" I recommend this DVD for all people who love to laugh!"
5,This guy is hilarious!!,"I have officially drank the Brian Regan kool-aid! My entire family all are major fans of Mr. Regan and his brand of comedy that does not require any profanity in order to be funny. This is an earlier performance and is absolutely hilarious. If you really want to get the full effect you have to go see Brian in a live performance. I laughed so hard I was sweating and gasping for air! Does that sound like fun, or what? Seriously, Brain Regan is funny, funny, funny."
2,I Walked on the Moon-Brian Regan,The quality wasn't great. It had a wide line down the middle of the screen. It was as if I had taped the performance myself.
2,Shelf paper with insect repellent.,"After reading all of the precautions I just could not put on my cabinet shelves. I will be returning it soon. Due to a family emergency I needed to go north for a while, but I shall return it in a day or two."
4,Above average original work,"This is a well written and entertaining book (though perhaps not as interesting as the author's other prehistoric novel, Reindeer Moon. It's quite different from some other more popular novels set in early human history, in part because Elizabeth Marshall Thomas is better able than other authors to get inside the heads of people very different from ourselves. It's not great literature, but it is certainly an interesting, engaging book."
3,"Meat, Eat - Eat Meat","The above title best describes how I ultimately felt about this book. I got sick and tired of hearing the words meat and eat. That's basically the entire book content.This review concerns the audio tape which I work out with, and the only reason I choose this title, was the narrator, Frank Muller. Mr. Muller, who due to a serious motorcycle accident will never again bring magic to another audio book could read a laundry list and make it interesting. His dulcet-toned reading is the only thing that keeps me listening as I run endlessly on my elliptical.In all honesty, I have not completed the entire story, nor have I perused Ms. Thomas' Reindeer Moon, but if I have to hear about the butchery of one more animal, if another berry is picked, if Kory has to have...ugh, meat one more time, I may just drop the entire story and listen to something else.I say that every time I run.By the way, the three star rating is for Frank Muller, The Animal Wife gets none."
3,Average Clan of the Cave Bear clone,Average Clan of the Cave Bear clone with the usual hunting action and incidental paleontology education.
1,I don't reccomend it.,"I thought it would be a great book becouse of the reviews, but my opinion after reading it, is that it isn't.I got very distressed while reading it and I didn't even finish it, I stopped about halfway.Chuck's writing style can be compared to fanatically religious people, it's pushing and distressing.There are some good advices and seeds, but also some very stupid.Far better same kind of book, what I would want to reccomend is Mike Dooley's 'Notes from the Universe', it's impact on reader is positive and uplifting, not distracting and negative.Seeds of the Soul truly made me distressed. I felt like I wasted my 21$.This is pretty harsh text, but that's honestly how I felt about this book.Listen yourself carefully, before you decide to buy any book, don't just rush and buy them. I learned my lesson and I will consider more carefully in the future what to buy and what not.Love and Laugh to everybody's life."
5,"The definitive work in this area, THE expert resource.",A confident hiring decision is a manager's dream. Lack of clarity and uncertainty at this critical moment is torturous. Living with a hiring mistake is hell. The ability to attract and maintain key people is the most important asset a manager can have. This book lays it out for you. Establishes the need and then crushes any doubt about alternative strategies. It is a must. Would have liked to have seen more skill developement suggestions.
4,behaviour description interviewing,"great contents, very useful - unfortunately the book is a photostat copy of the original. The copy has been bound like a paperback with a photocopied front cover. One expects a bit more than this for the price!"
5,A Fantastic Work of Research and First-Hand Knowledge,"Having lived through the last 50 years of these freezes, and being a student of them, Dr. Attaway has written a reliable, remarkable, and poingant account of these devasating events. I'm sorry that I am the first and only reviewer of this magnificent account of a piece of Florida history."
2,Spies in WWII,"We were disappointed with this story. I would like to read the book as I understand it is based on a really good spy. The direction and acting in plot is terrible and I am sure there is no resemblance to the actual heroine ""the white mouse"". I would not recommend buying this movie and one thing in particular that is annoying is that each story is only about20 minutes long."
5,Wish Me Luck Series 2,"Wish Me Luck Series 2 continues the exploits of the members of the SOE agents dropped into France during WW II. This series is an excellent characterization of life during those years, with rationing, loss of family and friends and women taking on new roles. Churchill told the SOE to set the world ablaze, and these agents certainly did. The characters are engaging, and action is exciting. The historical significance is outstanding. England was struggling in the War against Germany. The SOE and their cadre of spies made a huge difference in the War's outcome. This series is certainly worth the cost and would be a wonderful addition to your DVD collection."
4,Excellent accessories,"This item was purchased for a relative who uses his laptop constantly. He is very pleased with the case, its contents and the extra portability Verbatim products brings to his work."
5,You'll think you're gonna laugh about THEIR religion...,"Until he gets to your own.Just buy the damn thing, it's Bob for Christ sakes."
4,Oversold and Underused: Really?,"In this book, Larry Cuban details why he thinks a moratorium should be placed on all educational funds earmarked for technology. He methodically outlines the case studies of several Silicon Valley Schools. He points out that Silicon Valley, above all other places, should have been able to incorporate on a wide-spread basis technology-infused, student-centered teaching methodologies. Based on his studies, he predicts that not much will change in the near or far future as far as teaching is concerned. But he also offers suggestions as to how the desired changes in teaching might be realized. The book is interesting, well-written, and thought provoking. It may even be thought-provoking enough to facilitate the changes, he predicts will never happen."
3,Are they really underused?,"The book contains a lot of good information, including surveys, and observations. I do however, have some questions. If computers are so underused, how come everybody is always trying to get more lab time because the computer labs are booked up?Secondly, there are technophobes. Some people just can't handle any kind of technology. How many vcr's still flash 12:00?"
2,"An interesting book, but dated.","Hayward argues against both recent creationism and evolutionism in making the case for ancient creationism. The book contains some interesting ideas and should be read by any recent creationist. While his arguments against recent creationism are quite solid he fails somewhat in his arguments against evolution. Many of his purported ""problems"" with evolution have quite simple explanations that have been tested and hold up to the scrutiny of scientific testing. Overall, this may be a good introductory book but it is somewhat dated."
1,One Illogical Argument on Top of Another,"Hayward makes numerous silly claims throughout the book. For instance, he claims that a fortuitous Rb-Sr isochron would be akin to spilling peas on the floor and finding that they all line up. Fact is: No creationist supposes that isochrons form by such random processes. Instead, mixing lines can give rise to isochrons instead of millions of years of in-situ 87Rb decay."
2,Cut and Paste Job,"The author wishes to argue for an old age creation view. The way he accomplishes this is by selectively extracting from evolutionist material, those arguments that refute a young earth; and by selectively extracting from creationist material, those arguments that refute evolution; and slaps this material together to make this book. If the source text were on a word processor, this book could have been put together in one afternoon by cutting and pasting text. I did not see any original material here and it adds nothing to the C/E debate. If you want to study this issue, then get your hands on original material from both sides and arrive at your own conclusion instead of getting this book where all the material that doesn't support the author's conclusion has been edited out."
1,Compromise is a compromise,"As a YEC I bought this book to learn more about the viewpoints of others. However, as I am not a scientist, I would not want to comment on his scientific arguments but I sure want to comment on his Biblical interpretation which I feel is very wrong. He chides YEC for being dogmatic about the literal reading of Genesis and yet he is being dogmatic that his Fiat Creation is the answer. One cannot think that by casting doubt on YEC Bible interpretation that he has forever dealt with it. Alan is not being consistent with his use of the rules of Biblical interpretation. Just by looking at his Bible interpretation, one can easily see that Alan is more on eisogesis and little on exegesis."
5,Debunking the young earth.,"The author is a physicist and was a practising scientist, he is British and therefore he writes from a slightly different perspective to the books coming out of the USA. The most significant part of the book is the section on the age of the earth where he looks at the young earth arguments and demolishes them quite effectively. It is also significant that in the same year (1985) another book written in the USA by the physicist Don Stoner also debunked the young earth arguments. Hugh Ross in his 1994 book Creation and Time exposed the same fallacies as well as demonstrating the cosmological arguments for an old universe. All young earthers should read Hayward's book. ""Claiming that the Bible teaches a young universe only adds an unnecessary stumbling block to those who are sceptical about the faith."" - Matt Perman."
3,Just oK,This product is not as caramelly as I would like. However swiss miss is great with their drink mixes and the quality of the coco saves this.
3,"Beno J Gundlach J200B ""J"" Roller",I purchased the roller for the company i work for it came with a white roller pad that seems to be softer than the original black rollers from the past. If this product is changed permanently you need to update the picture if It didnt look exactly like the roller I would have emailed and questioned it thus it doesnt work has well for our application.
4,What can I say,Does what it's supposed to do. Allows you to apply a good deal of pressure to ensure contact between the two pieces. Not sure what else I might use as a substitute so I would recommend this.
4,Great help!!,"I love this work book! I was really helpful come crunch study time for the AP exam. If you use it along with the newest text book edition it will also really help. good simple review for the exam also acts very similar to the actuall AP exam. I also help me in my AP class. If I didnt have time to read a chapter a night, I would read the summary in the work book. And before an exam on mulitple chapters instead of rereading 50+ pages and doing 75 odd questions to study, it was better to go over the summary in this book. then if you dont understand somethign go back to the text book and read that section over. The answers with explanations really help too. Highly reccomend this book for an AP bio class and for the AP bio test. ONly flaw is that doesnt really help if you dotn have the text book to go with it and that doesn't have as many diagrams as it should. OVerall fantastic resource!"
3,"Content good, poorly edited","The content of this book is good, although in going through the examples and figures I did find missing figures and numbers that didn't match what Mr. Gardner has written in the text. ASA needs to do a better job of editing.A Multi-engine Flight Instructor"
5,Excellent book!,I used this book to prepare for my Instument/Multiengine/Commercial check ride and it was extremely useful. This book is easy to read and very informative providing a lot of practical applications as well as theory. This book is essential to your library as an instructor or professional pilot.
5,An Eye Opener,I truly loved this book and I felt a closeness to the women characters. These women were put through so much but I loved the way they held it together for each other. I would like to find out what happened to each of them. This was a very good read and you won't be disappointed. Keep up the good work.
3,"Trifling, but a few hours' entertainment","Though I found the opening chapters of URTBW greatly annoying (had the two professional-novelist authors of this book really never been to a used bookstore before they moved to the Berkshires? Did they really have no idea what pleasure used/antiquarian/rare books might hold for booklovers?), and the stereotyped description of book-dealers throughout tiresome (nearly every one an eccentric, an ego-maniac, or both; even if true, no need to make the point over and over), in the end I found URTBW pleasurable enough. Sure, it's the lightest of fair. But what booklover and die-hard-haunter-of-used-bookstores wouldn't relate to the authors' exciting adventures? URTBW is neither learned nor particularly well-crafted. But once one gets past the first couple of chapters, it's a good bit of fun. I'm happy to count the Goldstones among my fellow travelers in Booklandia."
4,Cute,This was a cute little book about a married couple who discover their love of rare books. If you love books you will enjoy this book. It made me want to go to the Berkshires to explore all these great used book stores. My only issue was the annoying thing they did where they had to spell the way this one bookseller David spoke. We get that he had an accent one or two sentences was fine but did they really need to spell words in a certain way every time he spoke it got annoying after a while.
3,Collecting Books and Being Cute at the Same Time,"I think this book is interesting and informative for the novice book collector, but I was turned off by the unflattering remarks they made about the people and places they visited along the way. Maybe they're not uncomfortable making fun of the ""locals and tourists"" because they are neither one..a good neighbor maybe? I think they were trying much too hard to be funny. As I said, an intresting read for a novice if you don't mind too much ""cuteness"" in one book. I wouldn't want them visiting a shop that I owned...just in case I'd be wearing a flannel shirt ..or a ballcap. People who truly love books and bookstores would probably never notice nor comment on such mundane things as the owners appearance and accent."
2,High-end yawn.,"A quick read. I liked it well enough, but found the constant repetitions of authors (especially Dickens) and/or books that I didn't care about to be annoying. The snobbish ""rare books dealers"" really put me off, as did the ""cheap"" book fair. The last fifty pages seemed to last longer than any other part of the book, and not in a good way. I was ready for it to be done before it actually was. I do like books on books, but Lewis Buzbee's ""The Yellow-Lighted Bookshop"" was much better than this over-hyped headache inducer."
2,Shallow in criticism and skimpy on necessary details,"Humphries supplies a quick overview of Bob's recording career, but skimps on the in-depth look any ""complete"" guide ought to offer. Dylan fans will argue with his quick dismissals and wonder at the omissions. Better books are available. Give this one a miss"
3,Paretsky never fails,"If you've read any of Sara Paretsky's work you'll know most of them feature Private Investigator V.I. Warshawski a woman with a law degree who has chosen rather a seedy existence. In Toxic Shock she gets herself into a great deal of trouble as usual. She is targeting industrial pollution and those with something to hide try to dispose of her. Warshawski lives in Chicago, and her assignment to discover the paternity of Caroline Dijak takes her to this city's seamier districts. The plot unwinds in a fast and most unexpected way. This is a crime novel I would recommend to any enthusiast."
4,Great for the price,"I bought this set for my daughter, she put it together very easily and is quite sturdy and nice looking. She was very happy with the style and quality of it. It's not something that I think would last for many years, and she probably won't need something for a good long time. So for the price I honestly think it's a pretty good value. Be aware that you must order order the chairs seperately, and I had to order them from a different company, even though the chairs displayed are the same they came from another distributor."
3,works but is a sloppy design ... could be so much better!,"When I ordered this for my D80, I expected it to fit like the old leather skin of the 35mm cameras of days gone by. It is just a hinged case like a gator's mouth. Yes, it protects but it makes it too bulky and hard to work with. Therefore, I wanted to put camera armor around the camera itself. You can't do that either, because the armor, once on, does not fit within the soft case. In summary, it's too sloppy by itself, but can't be mated with the ""under"" armor. I see it as a disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this camera case. It is soft, awkwardly shaped, with no strap, an insecure closure that offers little protection to the camera."
2,"Design OK, happier with previous Nikon SLR cases","I have had previous Nikon cases with screw-on form fitting specifically for the model, but this one is a disappointment compared to past Nikon cases. As mentioned by other reviewers, it is not that form fitting for my Nikon D80. The case has a small, thin strap which snaps to the camera. This small strap is very weak and if you take the case off and let it hang on the camera, it snaps off easily. My other Nikon cases would easily slide off and on with a secure mechanism (screw bottom), with no fear of losing or falling off by a simple snap. I was on vacation and it fell off when I did not immediately put the camera back in the case and did not know this until a stranger had picked it up for me. For this reason I am only giving it 2 stars. If there were a more secure strap to hold the case onto the camera strap, I would give it a higher rating. Please be aware of this feature when you are considering this case."
1,Not worth it,"I love my Nikon D-80 but I really don't like this case. It provides minimum protection, but the clasp to keep it on the camera strap is easily undone and so it falls off all the time.Also, there are no extra pockets for an extra SD card or battery. If I did it again, I would buy another case that was tougher, more secure and had an extra pocket or two."
5,Perfect fit for my new D90,"As of writing this review, there isnt a CF-D90 case available yet. So i was a little hesitant to pull the trigger on this one for my new D90 with 18-200VR lens. Just got it today and couldnt have been happier with the purchase. Its very soft and plushy and was a perfect fit for my camera. Highly recommend."
2,Limited functionality,Warning: This camera case does not fit with the Nikon D80 and 18-200 mm lens attached. It also does not have a separate shoulder harness or a zipper seal for protection from the elements. I ended up returning mine after 2 days of use. I replaced it with a Lowpro topload zoom II bag.
5,Compact and Protective !,This semi soft case is compact and can hold Nikon D80+ 18-200mm lens mounted + Filter attached. I would recommend this.Natraj Krishnakumar
5,"NIKON CD-80 case, simi soft",It is working out great for me It fits into my camera bag and give very good protection to my D80 SLR and I would recomend it.
3,"It's just ok, bulky.","I bought this for my husband because he is always throwing his Nikon D90 in the diaper bag. This would work great if the opening where the strap goes through was bigger. Instead of it dangling at the bottom of your shoulder strap, it dangles mid air and makes it a bit annoying. The quality is great and I like the way it opens. My husband wish it had a larger hole for the strap and could be a bit more sturdy."
5,No other case needed,I don't like to carry around a big camera case. This was perfect; it kept my camera from being scratched. Fits my Nikon D80 w/135mm lens perfectly. Wouldn't change too much of the case. It's simple enough and just what I needed. Easy to take out and use.
5,D80 case,"It's not a must-have, but it will protect your camera from scratching, or falling, or even in light rain. Especially when you're in travel with just one lens, this will help you to minimize your baggage."
4,pretty good,"I liked this book, but it wasn't my favorite. Bess is so dumb for letting that good guy go to waste. I understand her reasoning, but still... I'm glad they got toghter!"
5,ideas that will stay with you for the rest of your life.,"I read this book when it came out (my dad was a book reviewer). I found it funny and true, especially the ""Price's Laws"" sprinkled throughout.Consider the following (I hope I get it right): ""If everybody doesn't want it, nobody gets it,"" which explains why many of your favorite things disappear from the marketplace. That one pops into mind every time I find out that a favorite record or book is no longer in print.An extremely funny book with a good deal of truth to it.(With apologies to Mr.Price if I've misquoted or misrepresented anything.)"
5,Must-have for model railroaders!,"If you're a model railroader who scratchbuilds or kit-bashes freight cars, you NEED this book. It is jammed full of photos and information about early freight cars. There are cars in here that I'd never heard of before. Detailed photos and diagrams of brake systems, trucks, wheels, frames, you name it."
2,Nebulosity,"This album is great if you're into random noodling.Bennie Maupin, famous for his days with Herbie Hancock, is given tracks to play on with stale derivative drum patterns.The album would have been better had there been a real drummer but chances are he wouldn't have been able to fit his kit in the bedroom where it was recorded.This album suffers from LSF (low soul factor). If you want to here some great Bennie Maupin check out Slow Traffic to the Right (Water Torture) Or any of the Herbie Hancock Albums he plays on."
3,OLD time is the key word here.,"this is more of a book eaither for historians or advanced learners. if you are wanting patterns , great book. if you are wanting to learn how to do it like they did in the old ways great book. if your bran spankin new and know nothing about marbling nore where to get easy access to supply's you need. PASS! unless you know where to get english moss and ALOT! of it. the patternes are nice and the history was interesting. but its not a beginers book."
5,Concise but complete,"Very clear, with instructions to build the tools needed to marbleize and complete list of chemicals and paintings needed. Purposeful."
1,"Great purchase, timely delivery.","I appreciate the opportunity to find this older book on Marbleizeing Paper. I had done it years ago, but forgot, and now I have to do a demonstration, and I wanted the background information, and found all that I needed in this booklet. Thanks much. as ever, Donna"
3,Lots of Pretty Pictures But Not A Lot of Info,"I've been wanting to do this for a long time. I got this book thinking it would solve some of the mysteries of marbling. There are a lot of good patterns in here, but not a lot of suggestions about paper, or what kinds of paints work and mix well with the ox gall etc. I find that I am still wasting a ton of time on trial and error."
5,Secret Recipes,I bought another all-inclusive book on this subject but this book was the (marbled) frosting on the cake.
2,Auletta on Dobbs the bigot,"Lou Dobbs became known to the wide public as one of the first of CNN 's news-broadcasters. He has gone on to a popular career through moving from objective news reporting, to presenting opinionated bombast. Auletta sees Dobbs as prominent instance and forerunner in the societal transition from emphasis on wide- public straight news to one focusing on 'opinion- news' aimed at niche- publics. Dobbs is spoken about as a bit of a bigot in his calls for halt to immigration, on his anti- globalist, and anti- business message.I find Auletta a truly outstanding reporter and generally enjoy his presentations. Here however he was dealing with a subject of very mild interest to me, and I had a sense of wasting my time in watching the segment."
2,Adventures in Odyssey order,"There was a problem with the item (in that 3 cassette belonged in another series)and when I contacted the seller, they made an effort to find the correct tapes. Unable to locate them, the seller gave me a full refund and didn't request to send back the product. I believe this seller did the best they could do under the circumstances and give them a positive review."
4,Good tasting Salt,"Very good tasting I should say. I mix it with another Sea Salt I like and the combines taste is excellent and is easy to grind fresh.Use it alone or blend with a salt you like that could use a ""little something"" and enjoy ""custom made"" salt you chose the flavor and convince of."
2,Red 'Alaea Salt,"This salt had a fine taste but very shortly as the taste buds in the back of your mouth registered the taste, the after taste was really just awful...wouldn't use it now or later."
3,Not all are Original,"After hearing is 5 buck cd...it was found that several cuts were re-makes ""Keep-a-knockin"", ""Rock'n Roll is here to stay"", were not the original Specialty and ABC Paramount tapes. Most of the selections were taken from records. I have found that most Dominion Releases are remakes and less than good quality."
4,"perfect, and i would suggest","i suggest bigger size for the cards and to emphesize on the writing itself rather than the drawings, in order to give the affirmations the importance!!"
4,Worth The Money!,"This DVD is worth the money spent! I enjoyed it and recomend it to all looking for good video & sound. The only down fall in this DVD is they edited Rock Me :( WHY? This is one of the best songs Great White ever made and to cut it short is sad! But as for the quality of the DVD I give it a high ""9"" BUY IT!"
3,Nice complimentary work,Nice for quizzes. Some of the worksheets seemed bellow level.Can be used as complimentary work on top of the teacher's normal boom assignments.
4,red fern grows review,where the red fern grows is a book that will catch the readers eye it has very appealing story line and great plot through out the book it also gives great examples of character. this book is a good book to read in your own pass time because its hard to read many pages at once because of the many descripitive words it uses.this story is about some hunting dogs that fight for there master in order to catch some foxes that are eating his chickens in the doing so one of the dogs gets injured and dies. i thought this book is very good and has very good plot and scene description. this book tells you about what was happening at the time of when this story takes place. i would recomend this book to every one it is a very popular book because it is very well writen.
1,Save your $2 for a better book,"Well, it's 2 pages long. That is, if you count that it has extra large type in the title, large graphics, and a paragraph hawking his website as part of the ""book"". Overall it's really just a few vague paragraphs. Stupid me, I read a whole lot of the titles of these e-books and chose them based on the titles instead of trying one out first. I bought a bunch of them and there really are no new ideas in them. Each is 2 pages (or 3) long, with big type, graphics, large heading, and a paragraph at the end suggesting you subscribe to his website. I guess I forgot to wash the ""gullible"" off my forehead. Enjoy the $20 you made from me Dr. Nelson ... everyone else, save your money and buy a REAL book on management instead for $20. Amazon has a lot better ones to choose from."
4,Nervoheel It works.,Have used this product for years. You must take for about a month before it kicks in. My doctor told me about the product. Have a great day.Barry D
2,Not a winner,"To shortlist this ponderous story for the Booker Prize is almost as bad as giving the prize to Ian McEwan for his insubstantial 'Amsterdam'. The beginning of 'The Deposition' roused my interest a little, and I was hopeful that there would be a worthwhile story beyond the opening chapter. I was to be sadly disappointed. Despite increasing boredom, I plodded on, hopeful that things would improve, but was disappointed at the end. And those dreadful footnotes... (aren't I clever, they say).As one reviewer so aptly put it 'Brian O'Doherty's prose is excellent and, if he could pick a better subject (more content and less waffle) I'm sure he'd end up with a best-seller'."
3,"first half is good, second half is not","the beginning of this book was very very strong -- excellent writing, story, characters, etc. but it did fall apart about half way thru -- it seemed to me as if the author lost interest in the story and the writing and characters, while strong, could not carry the book to its conclusion. highly disappointing after such a strong start."
3,Good idea but went on a bit with little action,"Looked promising but thought it was a bit tedious in the end. Seemed to go on forever. I did like the writing style in the first 50 pages or so, but then it lost my interest.Might have been better with chapters."
2,Bit of a drudge,"The beginning got me excited, and I was sure that there would be a worthwhile story to follow. I pushed on, depite increasing boredom, but was disappointed at the end. It's a pity because Brian O'Doherty's prose is excellent and, if he could pick a better subject (more content and less waffle) I'm sure he'd end up with a best-seller. The footnotes were annoying. I wasn't sure whether to go for two stars or three. On balance, I think two is fair."
4,Planning Your Financial Future Review,"The book isn't bad... a little dry, but fairly easy to understand and gives you some good tips about financial planning, etc."
1,3 bus. day shipping expect more!!!,"I payed for a 3 bus. days shipping and did not get it in that time. That didn't help my first week of school. The book said New, it was not even shrunk wraped. The new books come with a workbook, makes me wonder how new this book is."
4,algebra 1 homework and practice workbook,a good experience. arrive time fine. book is OK. it is easy to buy. practical. I do not care about the book quality. I am satisfied.
5,Algebra 1,The book i bought was very good and i got it on time. Hope to buy more books from this site.
2,Not nearly what I hoped for.,"It lacks answers, which does help in checking the work quickly. Plus it seems to be more thrown together. However, it cost little and for thus a collection of problems it might be just worth it."
5,Interesting and Intriguing to watch. Recommend it to anyone.,"This is a great edition to my Geoff Hunt Collection. I've been a fan of Hunt since the early days of getting into Patrick O'brian (since Hunt painted every Patrick O'brian book cover). It's very interesting to discover the process by which Hunt paints. I never realized the complexity of it before. This makes for very interesting viewing. I like the way hunt takes you through each step of his technique. I'm glad I added this to Portrait of a Marine Artist DVD, this is another good one. Liked the music alot too. I heard somewhere that this won an award. Anyway, it should, it's a nicely done documentary."
5,Pleased With This Textbook,"Wonderful resource, easy to use, pictures very representative. Would recommend this text for anyone with an interest in Genetics, Pediatrics or Family Medicine."
4,The atlas for genetic diseases,"This a great book with fantastic illustration of genetic diseases, a must for all in the genetic field."
2,Beautiful but inaccurate...,"As the librarian for the K-12 school on the Omaha Indian Reservation in Macy, NE, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to purchase a book for the children to reflect their culture. This volume is filled with beautiful photographs and drawings, is laid out sensibly, but is filled with inaccuracies and errors. People are identified incorrectly in photos, and basic understandings about the Sky People and the Earth People are completely reversed. A page by page review by tribal elders and scholars have found errors from beginning to end. Representatives of the tribe are sending a plea to the publisher for corrections. My hope is that they respond favorably and fix the errors to make this a book of value and accuracy."
1,Farmers Almanac where is it?,"I always buy my husband the annual Farmers Almanac book but recently like last 3 yrs realized I read it more than him and only for certain parts which I assumed (WRONG) that the calendar would have those parts in it, such as astrology info such as when Mercury goes into retrograde, it does say when the full moon is and names each one (?) but no other helpful info was in this calendar and it was tiny!!!!! I had to change the entire area around where my normal calendars go which are larger and takes at least 2 nails or tacks to hold them up. Never will buy again. Will go read and write the info down at a bookstore and buy the Weather Channels weather calendar next year like I did in 2006."
1,Worst Comedian of All Time,"Things I find funny:Conan O BrienArrested DevelopmentThe HangoverSeinfeldAs for this guy, I wasn't just not amused, I found this guy painfully unfunny and obnoxious. I don't think comedy could get any worse than this."
5,Serious and fun.,"Both serious and fun. The serious side sounds like Miles, the fun side sounds like Ornette. A good recording by the same band that recorded ""Leap of Faith"". Highly recommended."
5,Best Buttery flavored instant chocolate ever!,"Just like Mom used to make, and my local movie theater has stopped selling. I've been very dissapointed of late without it."
2,depends what you are looking at,"This small book (192 pages) is pretty expensive but if it brings you a lot it is OK.It depends what you are looking at:If you want a book ""how to write a clean C++ program"", this book is for you. The authors enhance the formal (and correct) writing you should have when coding.If you are interested in understand and solve the various problems you encounter implementing derivatives with numerous examples, it is not the good book for you. There are few programs so few examples and solutions. Moreover I have to dig in his classes to understand them. I would have preferred static functions, even if I have to do a little work to implement them in my library.However from my point of view, the biggest reproach to this book is that it does not treat the interest rate derivatives at all, which is really problematic.So it was not really interesting. The Clewlow was much better for me."
5,I love it,"I've just cracked the first few chapter, I'm impressed and thankful. I'm looking for solid professional insight to the fundamental of a hot, tough subject area... great launching pad... to help continue the journey... not finished!"
1,Inadequate as tutorial or reference,"This slim volume is totally inadequate either as a C++ book or as a derivative pricing book. (After all, how much can you cover on either topic in just 170 pages or so?) I'm not sure what purpose it really serves. It seems to require the reader to know quite a bit of C++ yet things like virtual function should already be known by the reader. This is not good as either tutorial or reference."
5,Interesting history,"Who knew that African-Americans in the '20s, 30's and 40's had there own movie industry with black producers, directors, and actors? Very few of those old movies remain, but here are some. Great stuff!"
3,gritty texture,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews I read at several gluten free sites. I didn't really like the cookie very much since the texture was gritty and almost sandlike. The flavor is okay, but I prefer the Pamela's chocolate chunk cookie mix instead."
2,Not very good,"Just finished making these for my wife and two kids. While the taste is fine the texture is kindy of chewy. Chewy like you are eating a sponge. Just the other day I made some vegan cookies with a different mix I bought at whole foods and they were way better. I'll post a review of those when I get them again, can't remember there name but do remember there was a picture of Arthur on it."
2,Originality counts,"I ordered this CD for the Carl Dobkins Jr. song ""My heart is an open book"". What a drag it was when I discovered it is not the original version. A few other songs I listened to were not original either. When it comes to oldies but goodies, originality is everything. We listen to these songs mainly for the nostalgia value. Re-recordings of this type of music are a let down. Stay away from this series-find the original hits!"
4,Woodland King,"King of the Wood is a story about a warrior who is banned from his tribe of Norseman living in America for killing his half brother. He begins an arduous journey across the land, first meeting and becoming linked to a witch/priestess then eventually escaping from her and heading south. Along the way he has many high adventures including getting lost at sea, becoming part of the Aztec empire, journeying north from there where he becomes embroiled in Monguls and ends up conquering the aztecs, and stopping their horrendous ritual slaughters. The book is very interesting, though I was not a fan of the ending it was still a great read. I highly recommend it, though there are points of this book that become a bit too graphic in the storytelling. As much as I enjoyed this book, I enjoyed John Maddoc Roberts 'Conan' books a good deal more. But this should be read if you are a fan of this type of story, it is a very good book, enjoy,."
3,3 stars about right for this one..,As one reviewer pointed out..blotchy.Laura Doern does an excellent job....but can't save this film.The men chasing one of the characters are meant to be menacing but they come off as inept....as if lost.Raul Julia could have done this role in his sleep.The mark of a good film IMHO is that it should leave you 'feeling' something. It did...the feeling of being let down.No good reason to own this flick.Perhaps the real torture in this film was watching it. Maybe I should remove 1/2 a star.Much of this film was shot in Toronto...so that kept me somewhat curious.
3,What Blackbird?,Honestly I do not remember the plot. Was there one? We liked Raul Julia and will miss him. He has turned in better performances.
1,It was Awful,I saw this movie and I thought it was terrible! It was sortof blotchy. Some parts weren't there that needed to be....... It just wasn't very good
5,Live at Bally's las Vegas,I have never been fortunate enough to see Chris perform Live but this CD gives me the opportunity to see and hear him and his great band play all his hits. I recomend this to anyone to enjoys great country rock.
2,Smells absolutely fine!,"While not convinced about the effectiveness of this product on my daughter, I do feel the need to respond to other reviews stating that it has an awful, strong smell.It doesn't. It smells pretty similar to tea tree, lavender or eucalyptus oils - all very pleasant, natural smells. There is nothing offensive about the way this oil smells at all!As mentioned earlier though, I'm not sure how effective this is for treating molluscum. We didn't see much improvement with my daughter's spots, but to be fair, we didn't always apply it 3 times a day as instructed. Some of her spots have disappeared, but who knows whether this would have occurred anyway? Her case of it isn't that bad, it's just been ongoing, which is why I thought I'd try this product.Upon running out of this product, we recently switched to plain old tea tree oil, and to be honest, I suspect this is going to work just as well - if not better. One large spot has already disappeared far quicker this past week."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my 11 year old who had a bad case of molluscum. This not only smelled terrible , but did nothing to help him. The bottom line is that only time will help get rid of this virus. That and the dermatologist are your best friends to combat this annoying rash. My son had it for about eight months before it went away. We went to the dermatologist after about six months."
1,Does not work,I was very desperate to find something that worked for my 4 year old daughter who was battling Mollescums. I found this product on line after searching for information about the virus. I ordered it immediately and paid for the extra shipping to get it here fast. I used this product 2-3 times a day for 6 weeks and not one mollescum dissapeard. We are still battling this ugly virus.
2,Not sure yet.....,"My 6 year old son had molluscum, and after having a few frozen off, and waiting it out for almost 18 months, his is finally gone. But not before giving it to my then 4 month old. She is 10 months now and it has spread all over her arm and trunk. I've researched everything and will try anything. I really am only getting this on her about once a day. It is hard to apply it unless she's going to bed for the night because the smell is so strong, if I put it on her at the beginning of the day, or before we go anywhere, we all smell like it and it is a potent smell.However, I do think it has helped to bring the bumps to a head, but they are no where near gone. It has only been about 2 weeks, so after another 2 I hope to see more improvement. No miraculous healing, tho, like some reviews at all!!"
2,"two bottles used, no improvement","The dermatologist used beetle juice, which got rid of a lot, but was very painful. Daughter has two bumps left. We have gone through two bottles, and the same two bumps remain. It has been about 8 weeks. The reason I gave them 2 stars is because of their customer service. After the first bottle, they sent me the second bottle, free."
5,Worked for my son,"My son had molluscum spreading for over a year. I found this product and ordered it. After a few weeks my son's molluscum started drying out and going away. Although my husband had to order a second bottle, the moluscum was gone in a little over a month after having it for over a year. I would recommend this product to anyone. He only had a few bumps of the molluscum and his case wasn't bad. However, he did spread it to his little brother. I do plan to order more of this product with the confidence that the molluscum will be gone very quickly."
3,molluscum no more,"My 16 mth old has had this molluscum for 8 months and its all over her arms and torso. I used this product for 3 weeks 3xday and it has caused the big bumps to go and slightly dried out the small bumps. In our case, it worked by inflaming the bumps so that they turned into a boil, which popped and then healed. Th popping bit I think explains why it has spread further. It is very strong smelling, not horrid exactly but a very obvious smell. It has not had the instant effect that other users describe. But,I am ordering more as this had some effect compared to the aldara prescribed cream. It looks so awful that you have try everything."
2,Jury still out !!,"HiMolluscom no more ... the product has shown some signs of agitating the condition to the point where the body has shown signs of rejecting it. However, despit applying the solution 3 times/day the results have not been good across the whole of my son's body. Further growths have appeared and some have shown no signs of responding to the applied solution.In our experience not worth the price and the promises !!Glad it has worked for some though. Moluscum is an unpleasant virus !!Kind regardsMark"
5,Does what it claims,"We had no idea what those things were on our son, but they kept appearing in different places, and we had to do something.This stuff works great. You don't see immediate results, but with repeated application, the mouscums go away. We haven't used it in 3 years and he has no recurring spots,Two thumbs up!"
2,not very impressed,tried for 4 weeks now and apart from the molluscs flaring right up they dont seem to have dissapeared at all
3,As for adult use....,"I've noticed that most of these reviews are about using this on children with Molluscum. I contracted molluscum as an adult, which unfortunately spreads like an STD via genital contact. Maybe the molluscum is more resiliant in adults because it didn't work as well as I'd hoped. For it to really make a difference i had to open the warts and then use the oil... ew, and ouch. And even then it created more smaller warts around the area. I will admit that I didn't use it 3 times a day as directed- but thats because it smells so strong. If you put this on any part of your body, everywhere you go someone is going to ask, ""whats that smell?"" or ""are you wearing bug spray?"" ... yeah, its really strong. It helped to get rid of some so its worth a try. Ive found that apple cider vineager is also helpful."
1,Doesn't work,"I really liked the ide of an all natural, non-invasive cure for my daughter's molluscum outbreak however this was not. The product did not really work, espeically on the larger warts. It got rid of some of the smaller ones howevere it kept spreading and did not work at all on the larger ones. Disappointing."
5,Moluscum No More has changed our life,"My 7 year old son is recovering from Molluscum. Several visits to the Pediatrition and we were always given the, ""give it time, the body must figure out the virus is there""-- ( blah blah blah) We were given some retin-a samples that helped a little but barely. I searched and searched this summer while my little man had over a hundred molluscum bumps all over his face, chin, torso, arms and knees. It was truly horrible. He did not want to swim or play with freinds. The bumps were every where. After a lot of research, I finally decided to try Molluscum No More and it really worked for us. With in three glorious weeks, he is almost heeled. This product was an answer to our prayers and we are so happy to have found it! Try it, IT REALLY WORKS!"
4,OVERALL A GREAT HALLOWEEN CD!,"This CDs combination of songs captures the feeling of halloween. The creepy music themes and famous tunes are fantastic for the background in any halloween party, and is enjoyable to listen to throughout the year!"
5,GREAT!,"I got the product in record time! I think it was like 4 days after I ordered it, when it said it was scheduled to arrive 3-4 later than it did. Great service! Thanks."
1,"Rate The Item, Not The Show: FMA Season 1 Part 2 Boxset","Warning - Missing EpisodesMy problem with this box set is that it ends at episode 25 and season 2 part 1 starts on episode 29.I ended up having to buy episodes 26, 27, and 28 separately."
3,Ignore the hype of the other reviews,"This record is missing some of the most important tracks. From a song-writing stand point, this fails. 3 stars because it is the roses, period. Missing are: Driving South, Tears (enough to give it 2 stars if it were any other band), Daybreak, Something's burning, How do you sleep, and many more.Comprehensive???? A resounding NO WAY!!!!!! Classic??? Nope! Good, sure.TRUST ME: Buy the debuet cd and also 'second coming' along with 'turns into stone', and that is all you need. Walk away and enjoy all that the Roses have to offer. A great band that ended far to early, but not without setting the bar high above the mundane music world.Draa"
5,at last,"finally weve got all the record company wrangles out the way, and an appropriate and indispensable 'best of' released. if youre new to the roses then this is only one of two players you need to purchase. for me it contains all the best of the debut player and the only decent song ('ten storey love song') from 'second coming'. youve also got the singles and the 9 minute cut of the mighty 'fools gold'. theres a couple of tracks on there from second coming that could have been omitted, but i can skip those no problem. but be assured, you should only take ownership of this cd after youve purchased their first lp, it will stay with you forever!!"
3,"You should already know this, but you might have forgotten it.","But sometimes it takes seeing it in print to make it sink back in to your consciousness. I've dog-eared many pages and highlighted several sentences. This may be an older relationship book, but many of the point shouldn't be forgotten."
5,Pefect Dora Doll,"I searched High and Low for such a Dora doll in the stores, but all I could find were these terrible plastic dolls. I was so pleased to find this one on Amazon, and even more pleased when it arrived. The size is perfect and my kids (my son and daughter) both love it."
5,Lovely Dora Doll,"My 17 month old daughter LOVES this doll. If we leave it in her crib, she is calling out for it! She takes it EVERYWHERE!! It doesn't seem to be very durable though. But, thats okay because the price is so low that we can just order another one if needed."
1,No Effort,"Take a bunch of video clips out of storage, toss on a simple DVD menu, and that's what you get with this. Don't expect anything more, because there isn't anything. This DVD is nothing beyond EMI (who doesn't have a current contract with Concrete Blonde) trying to profit by rereleasing old material while the blonde is back on the scene."
1,nice quality if you like it,"I had expected and hoped for a compilation of actual live performances by CB. I immediately found ""still in hollywood"" one of my all time favorite songs. Sure enough, the song was exactly like the version on my CD by CD. The video consisted of a music video production featuring cute poses around LA and some attempts to cut in what looked like the band playing the song for several seconds at a time. Like I said in the review title if you like this it's nicely done. You get to see the band members and lots of cute music video playing around while you listen to studio versions of the songs. I'd rather have seen some poor quality but actual live video of actual real live performances."
4,Not for purists,"For those expecting to hear traditional harmonies in this acappella collection of carols and other Christmas songs, this will be a huge disappointment. But for those who like to hear a fresh take on old favorites the Swingles certainly deliver. I particularly enjoyed ""Silent Night"", a simple melody with harmonies with which Gruber (and purists) might struggle, but so rewarding to more adventurous 21st century ears."
2,Good until it broke in less than 4 months,"I liked it because I could charge various things with it, not just a GPS, but the little piece that actually connects to the GPS is a shoddy two-things-wired-together that broke after less than 4 months of use. I'm someone who's careful with my stuff, too, so this is pretty annoying."
5,purchased to replace a cassette,Needed to replace a cassette that was ancient and I no longer had a player for them...... works as it should
5,"Great movie, great book","The Trouble With Harry by JT Story is a fun little book about a dead guy who nobody really cares about. The 1955 movie by Alfred Hitchcock is also very quirky. I saw the movie first, and I am a very big hitchcock fan, so I would probably say the movie is better. But, if you can manage to get your hands on a copy, its worth it. I had to special order mine from the UK, cost me about $60, but I'm glad i did. Entertaining book, easy read. If you like this, check out Drowning Mona. Much of the same dark comedy, but its very recent."
1,mineral book,"This book was published in 1964 and evidently there hasnt been in updates. I ordered a copy which was said in ""like new condition"" Yea, well maybe it was in like new condition in 1970. but not in 2010. This was a terrible experience especially since I had it shipped to my Grandson"
5,Just A Great Old Classic Movie,"It's A great old classic Movie,And as I've said before?I just love Walter Brennan,and I'm yet to fault anything that he has appeared in"
2,"Greed Won The Day For The Producers of the DVD, And Amazon",The worst dvd recording I have experienced; it is a shame since the recording you will see on TV is pretty good. No excuse for this kind of quality.
4,Cell Leader Intern Guidebook,"Excellent work if you are involved or want to be involved in the leadership of a cell group. Perhaps described as the old testament of training manuals for cell groups. The new testament would be the companion book ""Cell Leader Shepherds Guidebook."
2,Wheels,The order came in without the center caps and it took a long time for me to find a dealer that sold them in my city
3,shiny but maybe too much?,I think the necklace is very pretty. Its very sparkly especially for the price! But i bought it to wear with a pendant and it seems to be maybe too much for the pendant or kinda take away from it a little. It would be nicer to maybe wear by itself. Its great for the price i paid!!
2,Nice chain if only......,"....the chain wasn't literally welded to the clasp. I bought two of these chains because they were so pretty and both of them snapped right where the clasp is welded to the chain. The metal is so thin than any pressure snaps the clasp right off. There is no hope of repairing it either because there is no loop. Your only hope would be another weld.A real bummer because it was pretty, I guess that's why it was so cheap."
2,Great idea but poor construction,"This could be an awesome toy for every child who wants to know how the nature works. I think the idea of introducing anatomy of an animal using a dinosaur as an example before the anatomy of a human is introduced is very good. Especially if you child loves dinosaurs as much as our 6 year old son does. This was our motivation in buying this toy. So the idea is great but a construction is poor. The parts do not fit each other well, it can barely stand as ankles do not fit leg bones tight enough. In order to build this toy (and then rebuild it to expose guts or bones) parents' assistance is necessary which spoils a purpose because it should be easy to rebuild for a child so she/he can play with it at will. Even though our son loved this toy at the beginning the difficulties mentioned above make him less eager to play with it."
1,cheap cheap cheap,"Don't purchase it. While it looked appropriate for my 8 year old who loves dinosaurs, it was so cheap it didn't link together. I have since thrown it in the trash. Disappointed..."
2,Great Concept-Poor Execution,"Received as a b day present for my 7 yr old son. He is great w puzzles and building on his own but the poor design left him disinterested. He could not get the pieces together himself and then as I struggled and tried, he lost interest. He was super excited at the start but now it is back in the box in pieces b/c we gave up. Nice in concept but don't waste your money."
4,Great Collection of Music,The Grey's Anatomy Vol. 2 CD is a great collection of music. I searched this CD out because I love the music they play on the show and went looking for the specific artists and was happily surprised to find the CD on Amazon when our local Hastings did not have it in stock. For my taste there were only two songs on the whole CD that I could've done without.
3,alright,shipping of this product was really great but the actual cd isn't really that good. i don't care for it very much.
2,the case is broken,the case of the CD is broken. it is mentioned on the destruction. the CD is fine. it is working well. just disppoint about the case
2,Disappointment,"The tracks recorded were not the best that I heard through the TV series, so have generously given it to daughter as an unbirthday present! Only good track was Snow Patrol."
3,Could have been so much better,"Overall there are some great songs on here and then there are some that had me changing the track to the next song. In my opinion, Vol 2 is not as good as Vol 1. Would have been alot better if Breathe was on here. That was the best scene in the entire 2nd season of GA. Shame on you Anna Nalick and GA for not putting that song on here!!!"
2,not at all what I hoped,"My wife and I are big fans of Grey's and the music we hear on the show. I dont know if the cd just doesnt fit without the show in the foreground, but we both were very disappointed at this CD."
2,Not what I expected but ok,"The DVD has good basics, but wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. I prefer the Hip Hop Hustle and PiYo with Chalene Johnson."
4,VERY GOOD SINGING,THE THREE D EFFECT WORKS WELL. THE STAGE PERFORMANCE IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE MOVIE. THE STAGE HAS EXCEPTIONALLY BORING SCENERY. THE VOCALS ARE GREAT. I HAVE ANOTHER VERSION OF CARMEN WITH DOMINGO AND I LIKE IT BETTER. THANK YOU AMAZON.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this to try to find something to help us send my son to Georgia Tech for Architecture. Out of all the sections I looked at, (which included Retired Navy, Resident of Georgia, Boy Scouts of America, Religious Affiliation and Architecture) I found ONE listing that even came close to what we're looking for. I would have been better to have been a gay, blind, black woman, from New York, looking for a career in journalism. I'd have found THOUSANDS of listings for this. I'm afraid I feel ripped off here, guys."
4,Old School and very nice fragrance,"This fragrance is woodsy, subtle and not overpowering. It lasts a long time and makes a great tshirt even better. I love this fragrance on my husband."
3,Where's the early stuff?,"This video collection was obviousely put together by NWA's A&R reps since they left out two early videos Express Yourself and 100 Miles and Runnin'. I also don't understand why a video was never made for Nobody Move? Although the Westside Connection made great music and videos, still, it isn't NWA and only made the compilation as fillers since Ice Cube was in them. Also, Gin and Juice would have been a more appropriate video with Snoop Dogg but again, these were obviousely not chosen by the surviving original members. Still, the video has enough variety that it's definitely worth buying unless you only want the videos from efil4zaggin or earlier."
1,Worthless drivel,"I am a teacher. I love teaching. I teach in a tough public school, and my favorite students are the ""difficult"" ones. I train teachers how to be better teachers because that is how much I love teaching. And I have to say, I hated this book. It was one incredibly long cliche--a story that has been told countless times before, and always better than this. It is poorly written (which is probably why it was not published by any major publishing company and why the reviews on the back are written by people no one has ever heard of.) It is full of mixed metaphors and simplistic maxims on life. I am not sure Bill (or William) McBride has a real understanding of students, teachers, or janitors--as none of his characters seemed even slightly believable. This book has a lot of syrupy sweetness, but nothing substantial enough to really offer teachers hope or inspiration for long."
1,Offensive and stereotypical,"I had high hopes for this book after hearing its praises sung by my grad school prof and reading the reveiws on the back of the book. I was truly disappointed. By page 20, I could predict what was going to happen because it is the same tired book about teaching that has been written hundreds of times before. Just another example of the assault on teachers--everyone knows more about teaching and kids than the teacher! A sentimental piece not worth the time or effort."
1,Total ripoff!,"Warning: this is $ 12.55 per single snagless boot, not per 'assortment' or sack. We bought 3 of them thinking we would get three sacks of snagless boots for our cables.... but to our horror we only got three single boots."
4,So pretty!,"I purchased a love seat and sofa cover in the champagne, and they are great. THe only downfall is that if you don't have a couch exactly like the one in the photo, it will not fit right, and looks weird. I have an oversized couch and love seat, with round rolly polly type arms, and I had to do a lot of overstretching and tucking in places. But anything is better than the old ugly couch under it! Plus, I have thrown them in the washer several times on gentle, and they are still brand new. That's saying a lot since my kids have spilt cherry soda, fudge, and ice cream on them. Not to mention the muddy handprints and dirty feet. Washes right off!"
4,clever teen girls,"As a pop listener, I could not ignore M2M. Marion and Marit are very talented and write most part of their songs, unlike other pop groups/singers. ""The Big Room"" is the awaited follow-up to their first CD ""shades of purple"". It's pure pop, with efficient lyrics and mature arrangements. I'm not a teenager, but I have to admit some of the songs really caught me.""Everything"", the first single, is great and I'm sure it will become a hit. ""Jennifer"" is also good. The ballads in this CD are well written with beautiful melodies. Pay attention to ""wanna be where you are"" and ""eventually"".M2M is already an international success, but I believe they could do better if they were not labeled as - teen duo singers - only. They have much more to offer and I think their career is just beginning.If you like this CD, don't miss ""shades of purple"", M2M's debut album."
4,Great Album!,"I went to the music store excited to grab a copy of ""The Big Room"" all because I fell in love with one song that I heard, ""Sometimes."" I bought the album, popped it into my discman, and was extremely pleased at what I heard. Each song on the album has a differen message behind, all which can be related back to teenage girls. M2M's sound is wonderful, as always, and their talent, both with instruments and voice, shine through. I'm very pleased with this album."
5,VERY GOOD,IF you thought Shades of Purple was on of the best cd's out there then The Big Room will compleatly blow you away. THey have really changed there sound in a good way. I think that now they appeal to many more people. My all time favorite song would have to be Miss Popular it is just an awesome song wiht awesome lyrics and an awesome tune. YOu really should by this CD. IT is also one of those cd's u can listen to over and over and over and not get tired of which is a major plus.
2,eh...,"OK, so the Big Room was not extremely horrible. I think Marion's vocal style has improved somewhat. The album's almost alternative sound is a huge improvement from SOP.However, the lyrics are completely lacking in substance. Very, very bad writing... ""Everything""- I liked, I admit it. That was the first song I heard and I liked SOP, so I decided to buy TBG. But when I heard TBG I was very disappointed. ""What you do about me"" is tolerable. ""Miss Popular"" and ""Leave Me Alone"" are hilarious and all I can say about ""Payphone"" is what the hell? That, in my opinion is the worst song I have ever heard...Most of the songs have really pretty melodies, but the empty lyrics completely screw them up."
1,In the Garbage....,"I eagerly bought this album. The same day I bought it I threw it in the trash. That should explain how much I enjoyed it. I wanted to buy Shades of Purple, but this was the only M2M CD they had at the store. ;("
5,Searching for a sweet pop duo,"i apologize for not writing a review here, but i couldn't find any e-mail of the previous reviewers to ask them trough mail...Some time ago on the tv i saw a video of two girls. One had long dark hair, the other had shorter half-blonde half-red hair. They sang a typical sweet pop song, but kind of a teen hiphop. On the video they danced in impossible colorful outfits with lots of colorful decorations in the background, also on one of the scenes the sang while sitting on a toyhorse, and on another scene they kinda played shoppping - there was a label ""Shopping with Dafney and Cornelia"" written on the screen (i'm very not sure about the names!)... now i'm desperatly looking for that band... was that M2M???"
2,"Yikes, what happened ??","This album sounds way different from ""shade of purple"" I only like a few songs on this album, all together it's not very good."
4,THE BIG ROOM,"I really don't know what to give this CD, it wasn't horrible but it isn't the best one I've heard either.Marion has gotten a STRONER voice and you can definately hear it on this CD. Some of the songs were a bit corny, but other ones seemed to stand out like ""Everything"", ""Miss Popular"", and the girl anthem ""Sometimes""Basically, if you like pop music, give this CD a chance."
3,great period for rock and roll!,"this depicts a great period for rock & roll/even better is ""High On Rebellion;Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic Frogs,Jayne County,Cherry Vanilla,etc. THE REAL SCENE! YEAH!"
3,"Not as bad as it could have been,","but not as good as it should have. A lot of interesting back story, and the beginnings, at least, of an original approach to the history of punk. It peters out before the book ends, though. I still think of punk as an American musical phenomenon that became a British marketing ploy. The shpole story needed a bit of the wildness that it documented so pedantically. Still worth a read, though.As for the little snot nose below--Why did you read this book? Why is it that every adolescent think he can speak for all teenagers?(""We like samples, not guitars?"" I happen to be near your age and happen to like both.) If you are so uninterested in history of any sort, go read Hit Parader. You can read all about Fred Durst in there."
2,THE PICTURES ARE THE ONLY THING THAT SAVES THIS BOOK,"I COULD BARELY STAY AWAKE, VERY BORING ,IT NEEDED MORE OF THE DIRT AND GOSSIP. I FELT LIKE I WAS STUDYING FOR A TEST! HOW COULD THERE BE SUCH A BORING BOOK ON SUCH AN OUTRAGEOUS SUBJECT."
4,A Mostly Solid Overview,"Obviously, at this point, a lot of stuff in this book has beenovershadowed by the snappier firsthand content of ""Please Kill Me."" But it's still a fun read and informative. My one real question about the book is ""What is this guy's problem with the Dead Boys?"" He takes several opportunites to belittle them--without providing much evidence that they deserve it. Aside from that, it's a unique and entertaining look at all roads leading to Punk."
1,Poor quality recording.,The material is good but the execution leaves much to be desired. Volume varies significantly between tracks. This CD sounds like a tape recorded off the radio.
2,Hello Walls the best of Faron Young,First Product: The internal menu of the CD was for Bill Anderson Essentials not Faron YoungThe second product had a similar problem. UNSATISFACTORY! Money refunded! Thanks! Bob LaCross
1,Don't waste the $2.00,The nubchuck grip was over sized hangs over on both ends. The controller grip ripped trying to put it on. I wouldn't waste .20$ let alone the $2.00 they cost.
3,"Not enough Goddess, too much Bull","I had hoped to be able to imagine the life of the ancient Catalhoyuk community. Instead, Balter emphasises the lives and works of the modern Archaeologists. It was a good read, but I learned precious little about what I really wanted to know. There were too many ""year book pictures"" and too few photos of artifacts. It portrayed the dig as a kind of Archaeology Camp. I am glad they had so much fun, but what did they find out?"
1,A history of a dig,"Too much info about the diggers and too little about the site.A brief history of finding the site and the dig would havebeen fine as part of a larger work, but this book is misdirectedand mislabeled."
2,A big opportunity - missed,"The mound of Catalhoyuk in southern Turkey is one of the great neolithic sites, and major excavations have been going on for decades. Michael Balter is a respected journalist who knows a great deal about archaelogy. Alas, he has chosen to tell us ABOUT THE DIGGERS AND NOT ABOUT THE DIG. If you want to know how digs are organized and done - the sociology and politics of the archaeology world, this is a good read. If you want to know about Neolithic civilization in Anatolia and how Catalhoyuk excavations have advanced our understanding, go somewhere else. A disappointment."
1,be warned,"This book is very disappointing, if you are actually interested in history and archeology. If you love gossip go for it though. You will learn everything about the secret lifes of archeologists (how they play and mate). Too bad that all this nonsense leaves no place for what would have been trully interesting - a detailed discussion of the ancient site of Catalhoyuk."
1,Mostly just Bull.,VERY LITTLE about the site. Almost all of the book is a chatty review of the various diggers lives. That's not why I came.
2,Interesting for archaeologists,"I was disappointed by this book. I expected it to be about the findings at neolithic site Catal Huyuk and various interpretations of them. It's really much more about the people and process of the excavation which to me is really boring, but might be interesting to aspiring or professional archaeologists."
4,great collection of videos,"I have the laserdisc of this, which I bought when originally released, circa 1990. None of the reviews for the DVD mentioned anything about quality, so when I get around to it, I'll just make my own DVD from the laserdisc.What a shame for the poor guy who ordered this in VHS format. Why you would want VHS in 2009 is unfathomable to me.I rate only 4 stars due to the length (40 minutes) which is short even for the laserdisc. Surely, even back in 1990, some bonus material could have been found. But then again, the title is ""10"" and there are 10 video tracks presented.The cover art shown for the DVD is a little different from the original artwork. The background was white with ""10"" in red. The new artwork has been squeezed together (horizontally) -- the band was completely to the left of the ""10"" and ""The Smithereens"" was only within the right side of the zero."
1,Don't Buy this book if you have others,"I frequently do crossword puzzles and am always buying the New York Times Easy Crossword Puzzle books. This one is really disappointing, it has many of the same puzzles as The New York Times Easy Crossword Puzzle Omnibus Volume 3 : 200 Solvable Puzzles from the Pages of The New York Times. It was a waste to spend money on this book when it has the same puzzles as the other book. It sucks to open up to a random page and have the puzzle be exactly the same as one I have already done. I wanted an easy crossword book, that just makes it too easy."
3,NY Times Crosswords for Lazy Afternoon,"Although it is a real quality book, I found it much harder then what I consider easy. Larger print was easy on the eyes."
5,More than extraordinary !!,"This 1st time author has more than hit the nail on the head !! Her warm descriptions allow you to feel the moisture in the air, smell the fragrance and see what she has gone and seen. A motivating journey that will have you question your purpose, and possibly help you to further define your vision. If your eyes don't well up on nearly every page. Your heart is not beating."
5,A must read book,"This is an amazing book. If you believe yourself that you are a christian and want to live as a real christian, you must check out this book. She is a living christain witness."
5,Gifted,"Gifted, as in plural. Anita Tarlton Sikes is gifted in her writing skills and her blessings from GOD. Her endeavor to find the TRUTH and her own self worth in GOD's plan is richly described in this book. The journey is a splendid one. It certainly will make you laugh and cry. AND it will cause you to ponder, your purpose in the kingdom. Can you, will you, reach out to another people in another land, risking the status quo, because GOD asks you to?By David Lee Waters Sr.,You will be blessed when you read this book. You'll look forward to her next book. You'll share this book with your friends."
5,Fantastic!,"I thought ""TWO WATCHES"" Was FANTASTIC! Anita Tarlton Sikes Is A VERY GIFTED Author. I DIDN'T WANT THE BOOK TO END! I LOVED IT!Leslie Carmel, Jacksonville, FL."
1,Disappointing at best,"Bought the book and looked forward to reading it. Very disappointing, not a true picture of my Ghana. Do not recommend."
2,Find another book,"This book can really be confusing when doing some of the exercises. Many of the exercises have very unclear instructions, plus the the author often times only gives keyboard shortcuts for the PC so if your a Mac person good luck. Most of the time you can figure it out, but it's annoying. At least the author could have given the menu equivalent. A couple of the exercises were so cunfusing that I just gave up. I did learn a little about Illustrator, but I got tired of the unclear instructions so I retired the book. I would not recommend this book."
2,This books is pretty but...,"That is all. Thre are some great exercises, but who can follow them. I wish Deke McCleeland had written this book. He at least numbers his figures so that you know what you should see when you do what he says to do. This author doesn't do that. There are times when a performed action doesn't render the result you expect. I'm giving the 2 stars because the book looks really nice."
5,Quality product that runs better then I could have imagined!!!,"I had hoped for an exteneded life for my AGP rig but I honestly didnt expect such an improvement over my 6600GT, which in its own right was a very good overclocable card.How wonderfull to be able to play FarCry on my recently purchased Digital Monitor, with full AA and all others set to Max at 1280x1024 and to have no stuttering even when tons of graphical explosions are being drawn on the screen.This card is really a treat and I have to pat XFX on the back for doing justice by the customer.And on a meaner lighter note, it sure is good to have the last laugh on those who called AGP ""Old"" technology with that ""we cooler and hipper then thou"" air to their braggings. Hope you enjoy trying to sell those old technology DX9 cards you ran off so quickly to buy for your PCI-E slots, so you can jump and buy the DX10 cards you gonna need soon. MUUUHHHHHAAAAA!!!"
1,Hope yours works,"It felt cheaply made and it is. The charger quit working the first day and no, the phone does not work by simply putting fresh rechargeable batteries in. I finally got a message to RTX and got a response stating they would send a new charger out, but they have since stopped responding. They seemed very Euro-centric to the point of not recognizing a US address and may have never actually sent anything out after I clarified the country it would be shipping to. It has been over a week and I doubt I will be seeing any new charger arrive. I went over the return period waiting for the manufacturer and cannot return at all. I am out the entire price and really regret purchasing something from a company that apparently has no US support. Check out the return policy when you buy because you may not actually get any repair parts."
4,works well so far,"Have this phone for a week now. It works very well.The only problem that I have is that it rings only twice before automatically hangs up, leaving a ""missed call"" message.I would like to set it so that it can ring many more times so to give me enough time to pickup the phone, but customer supports said it's not possible. I hope they add this feature in the next software update."
1,Very poor quality and frequent failures,"Aside from the fact that these phones are very tedious to use, set up, and edit contacts, one of my two handsets has failed in less than a year. The original batteries stopped recharging after only a few months in both handsets. They will accept rechargeable AAA batteries. Now the internal charger has failed completely in one set, requiring external recharging/replacement of the batteries about every day. Time for a new phone."
2,z unreliable,turn off many times during conversationunsatisfied have to unplug it and put it to rest for goodmanufacturer have to rewiew batteri system
1,Poor quality,First voice quality. Very poor. People with hearing problems or soft voices should not buy this.Secondly quality. My dualphone broke after just two years and it was well looked after.The keypad stopped working and the phone switch off when some keys are pressed.We have another much cheaper cordless phone that is now lasting 7 years without problems.I am very disappointed since it was the most expensive cordless phone I have bought and expected it to last me much longer.
2,Too soft,The phone is ok and works as expected it has a major flaw in that the volume is to low and I cannot hear the other party clearly. I think they had a firmware update to resolve this issue but I have to latest version and I cannot hear.As for the other features pretty much as you would expect.There is a dearth of Skype phone and very little choice for cordless dual phones.I would not buy this phone again but am unsure of what is worth buying.
1,Terrible Product,"Worst purchase I've made in a while. The handset always unregisters from the base. The UI is fairly painful. It's super sluggish and crashes a lot. The call quality is terrible. And...the worst part...it doesn't interface with Skype on your computer?!?! So if you mistakenly have Skype on, running in your tray, you can't even use it. Ridiculous. Do not spend that much on a phone that doesn't work."
1,PHONE SUCKS,"Terrible phone... and I bought 3 less than 6 months ago. Two are already broken. Frustration, hard to see dial and screen, upper buttons went out on 2 phone. buttons do not have a good absolute feel when pushed and are very small (often causing misdial). Though I can hear other person fine, others complain of the added noise they experience interfering with their ability to understand what I am saying. I have the highest speed offered for residential by RR and have no problem with Voip when using my computer. DO NOT BUY THIS or like me... you will be sorry. (this review is the only satisfaction I can get!)"
3,RTX Dualphone 3088,"Pros: use it with skype, alot of savings on long distance calls, I cancelled my home long distance and use this instead, cheap rates.Cons. somtimes drops calls, echos,buttons not too great."
5,TWILIGHT MOODS,"I am a huge fan of erotica. This one rates high in my collection. It has the right mix. Part spicy, part sensual, with a little dash of love and tenderness. Good for you JosselFlowers Green! Keep them coming."
1,It's not what you think,"The subtitle on the book cover is ""AFRICAN AMERICAN EROTICA"". I would be equally digusted if I purchased a book with a subtitle ""CAUCASIAN EROTICA"". In my opinion, good erotica is erotic, why should a book be titled based on the race of the subjects. I am returning my purchased copy... as it was NOT what I expected and that disappointed me."
5,Very informative and fun.,Great reading for the flyfisher who enjoys the high country or likes to get away from river crowds. Lots of fun new methods to try out. Trying to figure out where I can keep my pack goat.
5,A new author to alternate with CJ Cherryh--,"Finally! CODE gives SF fans who demand strong characterization something wonderful to read when there's no new Bujold or Moon novel. In Jani Kilian, we have been given a heroine both ruthless and curiously compassionate, a woman who has survived tragedy and may yet redeem humankind. And there's a bonus--the most fascinating alien culture since Cherryh's FOREIGNER series. More Jani! More Tsecha! More Kristine Smith!"
4,Know What To Expect,"If you are looking for an action adventure story, this is not the book for you. While there is some action, the story is more about the characters than the happenings. Reviewer 'Margaret P' said it well when she wrote, ""I felt like something exciting was just about to happen, but it never quite did"". And while I agree with this, I do think the book had more than enough other good qualities to keep it interesting. The characters were all interesting, even the minor ones.The biggest problem I had with the book is that there seemed to be so much story left out. At times it was confusing, and whether this was from the writing style, or intentional since there are more books, I do not know; however I intend to find out since I will read the next book. In the end, that's the best thing I can say about this book; I bought the next one and will read it."
4,Excelent book,"The plot and characters drew me in, making me anxious to discover the ending, which turned out (unlike many books) to be satisfying.My only complaint is there were a few ""clues"" to the ending that were added merely for the purpose of misdirecting the reader.All in all I am glad I read the book. I recommend it highly to others."
4,Promising.,"It's disconcerting to begin in the middle, as in this book, and the best bits involve alien thought processes -- humans seem harder to understand. Promising, nonetheless."
3,Interesting ideas but very slow moving to me,"I am puzzled by the fact that the ideas and characterization in this book are very good, but it seemed to drag as I plodded through it. I suspect that the plot did not intrigue or excite, and the few days taken by the actual story seemed very long indeed.I liked Jani Killian, the augmented mystery woman, but her capabilities and purpose were never clearly revealed. Likewise, the somewhat renegade idomeni alien Tsecha was a curious and intriguing character, borne on tidbits of information about his peoples and history, but not fully realized.This book feels like a promising appetizer to what I hope is a tighter and more satisfying second course."
4,Very good and informative,"Yes, recommended!Lots of information you will not regret knowing, specially if you want to become a pilot, you will be ahead of the game, you will understand how much physiology affect your flight...Great reading"
3,textbook,"I got my book, though I would have liked to gotten it sooner. It is/was in great shape :) Also according to my prifessir it is a good read as far as text books go."
1,Useless,I get the impression that those 4/5 star reviews are done by people from REA. Only about 15% of the questions and content the book match the test. Luckily I stilled passed with 53/50.
5,recommended study book,This book was recommended to us and it's easy to see why. Easy to follow format with loads of information.
1,Biased and missing info,"This book is biased towards the Catholic Christians. Not only that, but the bias puts unnecessary emphasis on the Popes, which did not reflect the content of the exam. It also lacked information contain in the exam, and as I took the exam, I felt ill prepared. I'd suggest finding a different study guide, if possible."
4,"Good review, but not quite comrehensive","This was a pretty good review of the general material for each era covered on the exam, but the content within each era didn't seem to match the focus of the actual exam. Although I did pass this CLEP using primarily this as a resource, I would highly recommend that you utilize other resources as well. This book didn't quite cover the depth of the material and the practice exams didn't really seem that representative of the actual exam.Also, the CD software is buggy win Windows 2000, possibly on other OS's as well.. Seems to peg the CPU at 100% during the practice test."
5,Great Album,"I am as grateful to Christina Pluhar for this introduction to Marco Beasley and Lucilla Galeazzi as I was to Paul Simon for Ladysmith Black Mombasa and Los Lobos. Beasley and Galeazzi are great singers.I also like this lively, inventive combination of ""antique"" music and ""folk"" music. It works just as well on L'Arpeggiata's recordings of Monteverdi and Landi.In the past six months I have purchased everything I could find recorded by L'Arpeggiata, Marco Beasley and Lucilla Galeazzi. I would recommend them all -- especially, Los Impossibles."
5,"Spiders, spiders, spiders!",An absolutely delightful album. The music and musicians are exquisite and hauntingly beautiful. The lore behind it is fascinating. I shall keep this nearby in case of a spider bite!
5,Antidotum Tarantulae,"I first heard this set as broadcast by Classic FM Australia. I went straight out and ordered my own copy from Amazon.The history of La Tarantella, as explained in the broadcast, was compelling. And the text that came with this CD, lifts the veil from its ancient roots. The music is passionate and tears out of the soul.I have become an accidental collector of recordings by Marco Beasley and have not been disappointed by any of his work.The range of music presented by Christina Pluhar and L'Arpeggiata is epic, truly wonderful."
5,Excellent new versions of well-known '60s hits !,"I received this CD a few days ago , and I have already played it several times. I have to say that I strongly disagree with some of the comments from other Reviewers , who have suggested that this CD comprises inferior re-makes of old songs. In my opinion , these versions , benefitting from modern technology , are in most cases superior to the originals , although I would admit that , in a few cases , the vocals are weaker ! I didn't find this a real problem , and I would strongly recommend this CD to anyone who is looking for particular tracks to fill gaps in their CD collection."
1,Waste of money,"I really looked forward to hearing the old hits. I recognized Mary Hopkin's voice, and I knew the song, but something was wrong. B.J. Thomas' hit didn't sound right either. Then I found the really small sideways print: ""All selections are new stereo recordings."" The more I listened, the angrier I got; these just aren't the originals I so looked forward to hearing, the ones that I expected. Yes, the price is low, but the value is less than zero, so disappointing was the experience. I will now skip all compilations which do not explicitly say ""Original Hits by the Original Artists."""
4,Saying Good Things In a Bad Way,"A fan of Tanya, Mary Elizabeth K. of Whitestone, NY said that when it came to talking the truth, you had to do the opposite. All the dudes might make meatloaf of you but at least it would get you out of working around the grocery store counter and back on the Country Music stage where you belong.Tanya Tucker has gone through a great deal but is still the original we have all come to know and love. Her friendship with Kathy and Mrs. Gallimore makes her friendship with Carlos Santana and Faith Hill a reason for her to pick up the microphrone and not put it down. ""If I could put down the meatloaf to oldies, I'd find him again in ""Another World"" (Joe Diffie) After all it was Tanya who bought Joe his first horse Bosco.""Strong Enough to Bend"" was a video she did at the request of her new french-canadian singer friend who wanted to make people understand that all the good voices don't live in mansions across the Riviera."
5,Earning respect on the Net,"This book is an in-depth analysis of the factors that make a Website believable. The authors, two librarians, examine numerous aspects of Websites and point out how they can be used to evaluate sites as trustworthy sources of information or goods. They begin with 5 traditional evaluation criteria: authority, accuracy, objectivity, currency, and intended audience, and give examples of how these criteria apply to Websites. They also extend these criteria with evaluation measures that are specific to the medium. They then apply the evaluation criteria to different types of Websites: advocacy, business, informational, news, personal, and entertainment pages. This book is a must-have for libraries and researchers. It would also be very useful for serious Web designers who want to understand what kinds of design factors will bring credibility and respect to their Websites."
2,Tom--by: Tomie dePaola,"This story basically tells of a time that a child, Tommy, spent with his beloved namesake grandfather, Tom. It tells of the innocence and gullibility of youth. In the story, Tommy's grandfather, who is a butcher, gives Tommy some chicken legs and shows him how to make them move. In turn, Tommy takes them to school with him and scares all the girls as well as a teacher. He spends the day in the principal's office, and a note is sent home. Tom tells Tommy that they will have to ""think of something else to do."" I would recommend this book for a child to read with a grandparent."
4,The Kingdom of the Hittites,"This is probably the most thorough treatment of Hittite history I've found, though I have not looked for this material for some time now. When I was working on my MA in history in the 1970s, I could locate few good texts on the subject, and most of those were in French. The advances in reading the Hittite texts have done much to fill in many of the gaps in their history over the past 3 decades, a good reason to keep current even in a subject that one feels one already knows. In Bryce's book the personalities of the Hittite kings are more defined and their accomplishments better documented. I found especially interesting the correspondence between Tutankhamon's widowed queen, Ankhesenamon, and the great Hittite king Suppiluliuma, documents that contribute to the understanding of the final years of the XVIII Dynasty in Egypt."
3,Good Work but lacking in strength,"This is a good book if you want an introduction to a tribe long forgotten like the Hittites.The book gives you a very good account of the Hittites battles and relations with other people and lands.It also gives you detailed information about its rulers and the way they created an empire, military speaking.However the book lacks information as to their lives in general.The reader is left in the dark as to what was the Hittites religion and beliefs, the way their goverment was run and the like.The book is basically who did the Hittites fought and when.Again, the book is a good introduction to hittite history"
4,Very unique and helpful,This is a very nice addition to anyone's library who's trying to get/is pregnant. Information you won't find anywhere else. Awesome. I only made it 4 stars because I'm a super tough critic.
5,"Great Book, very helpful",This book was very helpful in my pregnancy planning journey...a must read for first timers!!
3,OK book to have on the shelf,"This book was not an easy read, but the information in it was good. Not my Number 1 pick, but one that's ok to have on the bookshelf."
3,Not what I had expected,A slow story that I have been some what disappointed in. Not what I expected and would say the animation is good but story line is not that interesting and slow. If I was to do over I would not buy.
3,Tweed Fitted Blazer,Without question the blazer is of good quality. I ordered 2 a large and an X-large. They run very small. I usually wear a large but I could not even get this one on. I had hoped the X-large would fit but it was too small as well. So if you would like a nice looking blazer of good quality that runs on the small side this is for you.
2,It does look like a clown jacket but good craftmanship,"The tailoring of this jacket is great. I ordered size 5/7 based on the recommendation from earlier purchasers. However, it does look like a clown jacket and not as the picture suggests.It has tons of colors incl. red, blue and yellow and not in flattering ways either.Sorry but this purchase was not as I had hoped."
1,They sound good in the showroom,"I was impressed with these speakers when I heard them in the showroom, but even after a lengthy break-in period I found them fatiguing. Other than that, the bass is weak and the build quality is unimpressive."
3,overpriced,"Use to own pair of these and the didnt sound any better than a $150.00 pair of sony's. the 901 is where they made there reputation , everything else was overpriced and mediocre."
4,Very good speaker for the money,"I have owned many many pairs of speakers over the years (incl the legendary 901's) AR, Boston, Infinti, etc. IMHO, these 301's are actually Bose's best sounding speaker, and for their size & price, they are very hard to beat. You expect strong bass from Bose speakers, but usually you get over-boosted boomy bass. Not with the 301's. To my ear they sound just right, and you shouldn't need a subwoofer with these because the bass is solid & strong. I am not always a big fan of Bose products, because of the artificial, overboosted sound, but the 301's are great."
3,"Sounds OK, but not sure I got my moneys worth","Not much of a base sound, and there are a lot of other brands out there for a lower price that I believe gives the same quality. Still it is a good loudspeaker."
2,Terrible Sound,I am very displeased with the sound qualitity of these speakers. Sounds like the sound is coming out of a barrel. Have some inexpensive speakers that have much brighter sound.
5,Really the best,"Excellent speakers, beautiful and perfect sound, really the best, but you should include the connection wire to avoid having to waste time looking for how to connect"
1,The collection itself is great but . . .,"The collection itself is great, it includes much more than the VHS version, however I had a problem with 3 out of 4 of the DVD disks in the box not working correctly. I returned it and got another set only to have the same problem with the same numbered disks. I finally had to return it and did not get another replacement copy. I gave up after 2 sets displayed exactly the same problem. There's no reason for this because Sister Wendy's American DVD collection works fine as do all of the other art DVD's I bought. Yet, I had problems with this collection, so there must be a defect in the manufacture."
3,a little less than expected,"Wendy is very sweet and knowledgeable but not the in depth analysis of the art that I hoped for. And not that much art, either."
3,Father Barron's Next Series Next Should Be Done In Drag of Nun's Habit,"I am highly recommending this series for all those drawn to Father Robert Barron's recent Catholicism series. Thanks to the ministrations and dough of rich influential Catholics it somehow got made and they have succeeded with their lobbying to get it on Public TV. But Barron does not have half the art historical sense and honesty that Sister Wendy had. And that is already saying a mouthful. Also, I want to see Barron stand in front of a great David Hockney and talk about his ""boyfriend"" or ""lover"" as Sister Wendy did. The one thing Barron really could get from Sister Wendy and continue his schtick is to do the show in drag, with a Sister Wendy style nun's habit. He would look great. And that would at least make it entertaining."
2,Sister Wendy,"They came in a timely fashion, but the final tape had technical problems and the video was warbley."
4,A helluva smoke,"This is a terrific PI novel set in Little Havana involving the world of counterfeit Cuban cigars. Cigar smokers will definitely enjoy it, as will anyone with an interest in Miami and, more specifically, Little Havana. John Lantigua knows the terrain on all accounts, and he has a nice sardonic style. I've read other detective novels set in Miami's Cuban community (Bloody Shame by Carolina Garcia-Aguilera, for one) and this is far superior. On the basis of The Ultimate Havana, I will be seeking out other books by John Lantigua to read."
4,"Arrived broken, but works well after I fixed it.","Blows very warm air far out into the room (much better than the other 7 or 8 portable heaters I've used that only heat the floor for 2 feet). Controls are easy to use. Unfortunately mine arrived with a loose fan inside. I found one of the screws holding the fan was cross-threaded and broken, and the other one was loose (this was poor assembly, not shipping damage). I fixed it, rather than returning it, and it works well (I don't recommend anyone doing this unless you have electrical expertise - and a long Safety Torx driver for the screws)."
4,"Good beginning, for Windows users","This book really should have been titled 'Creating your first web page with Microsoft FrontPage Express', emphasizing that the book isn't of much use if you're a Mac or Linux user. I also have a minor quibble that the book implies that you need to install FrontPage Express from the Windows 98 CD - obviously you only need an Internet Explorer CD or download. These points notwithstanding, this is a very good introduction that really will help you design your own webpage. Once you've done that you can then go and learn a bit of HTML, beginning with something like Sams Teach Yourself HTML 4 in 10 minutes, or HTML 4 Made Simple (a British book, see amazon.co.uk website) rather than the mite disappointing CliffsNotes Creating Webpages with HTML."
1,Waaaay too old!,"Don't waste your money on this book unless you already have, and want to use, FrontPage Express - a program that I could not find anywhere to download. Note that the date the book was published is 1999, which makes it 6 or 7 years old - exceedingly old in cyber terms! I don't know why they are ordering more to sell. No one appears to have anything to say about the book since 2000. Get something newer!"
5,great,this saw is wonderful ......is made of good quality material and arrived in good time......i would deal with these people again
2,Not what I expected,The Picture accompaning the description doesn't show the hand grip as clearly as it should. It does not have a comfortable grip. It might be okay if you had the hands of a giant.
4,"""Discovering your gifts"" and ""Being proud of who you are""","The two Buggville stories contained in this novel Topsy-Turvy book are wonderful. Both Cooty-Doo and Crick-ette come to terms with challenges that make them more mature bugs. These are great lessons for children. My only caveat is that some of the language is at a higher learning level, e.g., ""menacing,"" ""ramshackle,"" ""occasional,"" ""rousing,"" etc. Overall, the illustrations are fantastic. I think that kids will love this book, especially with an older reader to help them."
2,Nothing New Here,"I found this book to be a bit of a con job. By the title and jacket it seems to offer some sort of secret code of living effectively--but as you read it you will realize it's simply a mash-up of Eastern concepts from Buddhism, Taoism & Hinduism, conjoined with Western notions of ""being yourself"" and not worrying about others approval. If you've never read anything on these topics before, maybe it's worth your time. Otherwise you will be bored. Much better to read (or read again) Robert Greene's 48 Laws of Power."
2,Poorly written but with an occaisional gem,"What is best about this book is that it (I believe) conveys certain chinese philosophies regarding success which have not be translated into the western world. This book describes techniques and examples without moral regard, more like a how-to book for nascent dictators. -Thats what I like. The reason for my low rating is three pronged. First, the book is poorly written, some concepts being covered ad nauseum, some not at all. Second, the book is so-selfserving, flattering the reader every chapter that they are so wonderful as to be reading this book. And lastly, the book claims that practicing a black heart can be equated with spirituality. I don't believe this point, and can only guess the author included this concept to make the book palatable to the western reader."
2,promises too much,"you will learn as more analyzing the business practices of the local chinese carryout. $2.00 extra for three pieces of brocoli? and the difference between happy family and triple delight is? this shrimp isn't three cooked, its only two! there sure is alot of breading surrounding this kernel of chicken.basically do what this book does: find a niche markdet. promise alot deliver what appears to be alot on the surface but in reality is a little. and be firm in your position.why is a book on the secrets of asian business practice quoting american athlete jim brown?worth a cheap perusal but do not pay full price."
5,struggling to reconcile east and west? you must read.,"Having practiced eastern philosophy for many years I frequently found myself confused about its seeming incompatibility in a western world. Until i read this book.Very easy to read, with lots of great examples and exercises. I don't usually go in for books with exercises but they are more meditations than anything.This is a must read, mine got damaged and i'm buying a second copy for myself and one for a friend."
2,Contrasting issues,The book just illustrates the complexity of life and there are no real/right answers to a question. The book gives contrasting perspectives to a lot of issue. Illustrations was given to be strong/ruthless and again illustrations are given to be soft/yielding. As a whole it is a confusing book. I will not recommend it to anyone.
5,Excellent Stuff,"I have enjoyed reading out of Thick, Face Black Heart. It is about knowing your safe distance from others, how to represent yourself in the best ways, and get ahead through deceit. BUT not deceit as most of us think. There are positive strategies that teach us how to do what is right or good no matter the consequences around us and keep a cool head. It helps detach ourselves from negative elements around us. It is a book for warrior souls in business and in life. It's for a success-oriented person."
1,Oversized brochure for business services,"Cant recommend this book at all. it is basically an over sized advertising pamphlet, trust me, I know, work in marketing.Author gives sporadic, disjointed observations overloaded with thinly veiled product promotions of her consulting business."
1,Worthless,"Don't buy the book, I'll give you the entire synopsis: It's ok to screw your friend if it's business, because after all there's friendship and then there's business. There are long rambeling stories (fine) but no punchline. Buy THE ART OF WAR for the true oriental thought, and any other business book like THE 7 MINUET MANAGER for the skills and you won't frustrate yourself like I did. But some seem to have enjoyed her style it seems (fine) but I never got her point of just what Thick face or black heart really ment."
1,"In fact, I want to give a negative point.","This book is very wrecked. Its main idea is u have to sacrifice anything to gain everything u want, no matter it is moral not. It teach u to be a black heart and thick face as the title. When reading it, I felt dizzy."
2,"Learned some things, but...","I read this book three times trying to grasp the underlying message. I liked it less each time. At first, I found the book fascinating, but then I tried to make sense out of it all. When I finally did, what I found was ""Decieving people is o.k. as long as they benefit according to your rules."" I found that being focused on your goal of money or power is the way to get it. What I did not find were ethical considerations or the need for value clarification. Some of the people Ms. Chu quotes are not people that I admire, such as the oil monopolist and cutthroat capitalist T. Boone Pickens. I also couldn't help but think that Ms. Chu is trying to become a cult figure. I would rather read a book which tells me how to succeed AND be ethical. It is an interesting book for it's explanations of Chinese philosophical concepts, but for success strategies I will go on recommending Steven Covey or Anthony Robbins."
1,Weak Sauce compared with real Thick Black Theory,"This book is ok for a beginner, but it's mostly full of Chu's own ideas on what Thick Black Theory is, but a lot of it is just dillution . . . I would recommend reading Li Zongwu's original Thick Black Theory in English . . .Thick Black Theory: Forbidden Strategies For Victory"
2,Full of anecdotes that fail to illustrate to main elements..,"This book contains many BS anecdotes; I haven't had a chance to read any other English versions on the theory of Thick Face and Black heart yet, but this is sure as hell not a good way to start."
1,Get to the point!,"I was highly disapointed by this book. The ideas presented can be summed in in one sentence... To get whatever you want, do what ever it takes.The problem is that it takes Chin-Ning Chu several hundred pages to say that and she does so by telling stories which have little relevance to anything.Save yourself the money."
3,incoherent and not very profound,"After reading the book meticulously and rereading all the summaries of every chapter at the end of the book, I found that the chapters were all loosely coupled. Though I haven't read much book of this genre but nonetheless I didn't find it an eye opener of sorts. The author failed in her job to amuse and enlighten the readers in using flaccid anectodes. What she preached is not all applicable in real world situations. The message delivered could be useful to those who are dealing with thick face black heart, but know that not everyone in the world is like that. It's not a must having this book, but if you do intend to read it, I recommend you reading only the summaries at the end of every chapter. If you find anything that interests you or incomprehensible, then read up that particular point from that chapter. All in all, the book is quite directionless."
2,Eastern Philosoply meet Western Life and Capitalism,"After having lived for over half a century, I have come to the conclusion that there are no ""secrets"" that if only known to us commoners and working class people would change our lives in any significant way.I am very skeptical with advice such as ""being one with the universe"" while stewing in a traffic jam.TFBH did not even throw me a bone with even a little meat on it. Basically it is an Eastern styled version of Looking Out for Number One.I did not glean anything that I did not already know - there were no earth shattering revelations or jewels of wisdom by the end of the book.Perhaps I overlooked something or it just was not a book I could relate to. This one will be donated to the local library."
4,Great overview and accurate reviews,"While driving our campervan around New Zealand, we referred to this as ""the bible."" Restaurant reviews were accurate, and when the LP designated something as ""worth seeing"" it typically was. We took the book's advice often and strayed as far as possible from the typical routes taken by other drivers. The only downfall of the LP was its lack of easily accessible street maps. So, if you're planning on doing lots of driving, I would recommend getting a road atlas as well...this'll save you a lot of time flipping from page to page and map to map. Enjoy your travels!"
2,Buy a book not an e-book for travel,"I bought this e-book because I thought an e-book would be easy to pack and carry. It was. But it was impossible to use maps and hard to skim quickly through things I was not interested in. I now realize how often I flip from page to page in a real book while I tour. So it was not helpful. I ended up going to a bookstore in Auckland and buying another tour book for ~ $47.00 --- and it would have been around $30 for that particular book in the US. I love my Kindle, but will not by a travel book again."
4,Overall great asset when traveling,"This guide includes a lot of detailed info related to excursions in different areas. Also included detailed maps that show you hotel accomodations in relation to eateries, and things to do and see. The guide also lists must see attractions at the beginning of each area chapter so you know what not to miss. Good organization, can find info fast."
1,"Useless, basically","This Lonely Planet is basically useless for families. The authors are all single, adventure-seekers and have probably never changed a diaper in their lives. So they go on about sky-diving and hiking 75 km trails around Christchurch and grabbing a beer here and there... Not practical for many.This books also presumes you know WHERE you want to go in New Zealand. There's no explanation about choosing north vs. south island. Instead, it's just an endless mish-mash of ""activities"" without any real themes to it all except the ""maori"" and ""nature"". Unless you read the entire book cover-to-cover, you won't know what to do.Not recommended unless you have all the time in the world to research the trip. And that's not why one buys a guidebook! Last point -- there's limited visual appeal with almost no color/photos -- the book looks mostly like a newspaper."
3,Good book ... fantastic country!,"Unlike other reviewers I didn't have RG or another guide to compare to. I did find LP New Zealand useful, and it did help us find some places that were off the normal tourist trail that we would have otherwise missed. However I couldn't get used to the new layout and found myself frustrated that things didn't seem to be located where I expected them to be. I found myself page flipping a lot of the time. Perhaps I'm just tuned into their old layout, and I'll get used to the new one with more use.New Zealand is stunning -- worth a visit no matter which guidebok you take!"
3,Get Lonely Planet,"We just got back from weeks in New Zealand! God it was great when the sun was shining, but the South was a bit wet. Anyhow, we bought a Lonely Planet, were given a Rough Guide, and when we got to Auckland we bought an Nz Frenzy. We liked Lonely planet more than Rough Guide, but they both cover almost exactly the same stuff, and neither gives enough details about trails and directions to beaches and waterfalls. The Nz Frenzy book was definitely our favorite to get us to cool spots on the North Island, but it only covers the North and there is no South one, so that was disappointing. Overall we agree that you should get a Lonely Planet for all the traveler essentials, but definitely get an Nz Frenzy if you have your own car/van on the North. Also you'll need a good map because it's just too hard to use all the little maps in Lonely Planet. Hope you find Kerosene creek and Tongaporutu on the North and Kaikoura's cute seals on the South. Cheers!!"
3,Simply outdated for 2006 travel,"I am near the end of my 1 month stay in NZ, and in the past month, I have encountered too many instances where I relied on LP's info but found it to be erroneous. Trains/ferries no longer running, activities/tours no longer in operation, and restaurants that have closed (in various regions). This book has proven to be a disappointment for 2006. (Thank god for the internet so I am able double-check everything.)"
4,Informative and nice layout,I really like the new layout for the Lonely planet series. I'm also glad that Lonely planet has been adding a little more opinion in its guides. The Lonely Planet New Zealand 12th edition is a great book. This book is an interesting and helpful read for anyone considering NZ. My only complaint is I was hoping the book would have the road atlas in the back that the LP Australia guide has.
3,Not very useful,"I'm just back from a week on the North Island. Before I left, I compared the various guidebooks carefully, both in bookstores and by reading Amazon's online reviews. Once I was in NZ, I found the Lonely Planet guide to be difficult to use--the layout, small type, organization, etc. I would have liked a more user-friendly guide, with the highlights of each area or city clearly marked. For Wellington, Lonely Planet doesn't even list the amazing Te Papa museum as one of its must-sees! I found myself relying almost exclusively on the Footprints guide to New Zealand--excellent, highly recommended."
5,Highly recommended,"I just went on a month-long trip from Auckland to Christchurch, and this book was very helpful. Apparently a new version is going to come out soon. Definitely get the new one as some of the information was starting to get old.You don't absolutely have to get a travel guide before going to NZ (especially if you're on a tour like Kiwi Experience), but if you are going to get a travel guide, I couldn't imagine a better one than the Lonely Planet."
2,New Zealand Country Guide,Very disappointed in this Lonely Planet book. It does not have the beautiful color photographs we have come to love about the usual Lonely Planet guidebook. Also find the font very difficult to read.
4,Good guide-We plan to go there.,We plan to go to New Zealand and used this guide to help plan. Probably take a tour but this book tells us what the tour should include.
3,So So,The maps are very hard to read and the descriptions are very disorganized. One good point is that the places mentioned are numbered and noted on the maps
4,Melissa & Doug nursery,"This furniture looks great and plays well. You can't beat this, especially for the price. I wouldn't purchase for toddler, but is perfect for young girls. Very realistic."
2,To fragile,"I bought this for my daughters doll house and it lasted a pretty good while, but broke just like other reviewers said theirs did. Would not recomment this for kids."
3,gift for grand daughter,Bought this as part of a christmas gift for my grand daughter who live thousands of mile away. They like the furniture and LOVED the Melissa Doug Deluxe Doll House. The house is 5 stars.
3,nursery set (is not solid wood like doll house),I bought the wooden doll house for my granddaugher. It came with wooden furniture and family. I thought i would get the nursery set since my granddaughter is about to become a big sister. It is not the same heavy duty wood furniture of the rest of the house. The baby cradle just got broken by just dropping.
4,Great older kid dollhouse furniture,"This is great furniture for your older dollhouse lover. It is well-made and ""playable"". It is higher quality than the plastic stuff geared for young children -- it has the appearance of the collectible stuff made for collectors -- but is sturdy enough for true play. Overall, we have been very pleased. One caveat about the nursery set: the rocker is exactly the same rocker sold in the living room set only painted white. Not a big deal -- but a little disappointing to a thirteen year old who notices that stuff. :)"
4,Cleverly fun!,"Sherlock Hemlock is the quintessential detective of Sesame Street. His caseload is nothing like the real Holmes though! When Hemlock reads about aliens from another planet preparing to invade Earth he is ready to solve the case! Hemlock had no idea a storm would give him all the clues he needed to solve this case.I shared this book with preschoolers during ""Tell Me A Story"" at the Festus Public Library. They were excited and wanted to know when they would get to see the aliens. The ending was nothing they expected but warm-hearted and clever. True to Sesame Street style and values."
5,gritty guerrilla warfare,"James Carlos Blake is one of my favorite writers, as he primarily deals in historical fiction, my favorite genre.This novel, in my opinion, is by far his strongest work.Bill Anderson is no hero by any standard; littering the landscape with dead Yankee and Yankee sympathizer (and not a few mistakenly identified people) bodies.The border war between Kansas and Missouri was a revenge-driven tit for tat hell that assumed a life of it's own, and once up and running, impossible to stop.Having served in Iraq, I can say that the violence and ""tribal"" warfare that Blake brings to life is.....amazingly human.If you love rich language and humanizing of characters, give this novel a place on your shelf."
3,Could be better.,"Don't buy this if your air rifle fires over 1,000 fps. My grandson has a one pump, 1,200 fps air rifle and it would eat this Gamo up! If you have a multi-pump rifle you can control the velocity and this target works well."
3,Chinese Junk,"Good design, bad size. Smaller targets are ridiculously small. This is okay if you have the time and knowledge to change a few things. I removed the 2 smaller targets completely. On the larger targets, I pop rivited fender washers to make them a little bit larger. I put a piece of vinyl car floor mat as a stop in the target housing. It did work very well. I would not recommmend this to anyone that is unwilling to improve it."
2,not what i expected,"I'm not able to use it, what I bought it for. why are you numbering the number of words before allowed to release this."
3,ONLY for 3-4 ft-lb air pistols,"This is a fun gadget, but it was designed back when Gamo was selling very low powered air guns, not the kind of 12 to 30 foot-pound guns popular today. If you only use this with low powered (3-4 foot-pound) pistols, like target pistols, or extremely low powered air rifles, like a GAT, it'll work just fine. Anything more powerful will quickly destroy it, and BBs will ricochet off it and inevitably cause injury."
3,Need FPS for .177,"Target works well with our .22 Benjy pump rifle and the .20 Beeman R-7 at 60+ feet. However, our 750 fps/.177 rifle has a tough time getting the targets to stay up at thirty feet. Great excuse to convince the powers that be to buy a 1000+ fps .177!"
1,A Total Piece of Junk!,"Within the first 10 minutes of use, the mechanism ceased allowing hit targets to remain in the hidden position until reset. Rather expensive item based on the few minutes of use I got out of it when figured on a cost per hour basis! Of course I can continue to use it by simply observing the movement of the intended target when hit, but that's not what I paid for. Buy something with a lot more quality than piece of useless junk!"
4,Excellent product and fun to use.,The Rocker Pellet Trap is constructed well and is fun/easy to use. I highly recommend the product...especially for indoor target shooting.Here are my experiences:1) I follow the instructions and only shoot lead pellets at the recommended velocities.2) On occassion I have noticed that a pellet escapes the trap and lands about 2-3 feet in front of the trap. I view this as acceptable because I am about 12-15 feet away and always were safety glasses.3) The Rocker Pellet Trap provides good reliable action.4) My kids like it better than paper targets.
2,Poorly constructed,"This is a well-designed little trap, and would be great fun if it was well-built. But it's not. The target plate mechanism is held in place by metal rods that extend across the trap through holes in the side. These rods should be threaded on both ends and held in place by nuts. Instead, they are ""secured"" by cheap little plastic washers. These washers come off easily and cannot be re-used. And when one comes off, that end of the rod falls down into the trap rendering it useless. I have had two of these traps - the first arrived with three washers off the rod ends, and the rods and target plates lying in a pile in the bottom of the trap. The replacement trap arrived oksy, but after a few shots from a low-powered airgun two of the washers came off, causing those rods to fall down inside the trap. Very frustrating. Simply threading both ends of those metal rods and securing them with nuts would make this a really great and durable target trap. As it is, the thing is a piece of junk."
2,outdoor enthusiast,"My son got one of these targets and the first time he used it, we were disappointed. He has a higher powered air gun and it put major dents in the walls and bent the targets a bit. If you have a lighter powered air gun, it's a really nice little target. It works great and is a lot of fun to practice with. However, if you have much power it's not going to last long."
3,well its a target,well it works and it don't work target must be laid flat and level to function 100% and even then you might have a few problems getting the pop ups to stay up. the idea here is that you shoot the 4 outside targets first and the center 1 last to reset the other 4 but I found that the outside 4 don't really catch the stop when ht so sometimes when hit they just swing back and forth... you can still tell that you hit it so it still works for target practice but not as functioning as described in description... but on the plus side the catch works really well and to dump it all you have to do is tilt it to one of the front corners so if you're just looking to get something to shoot at while keeping your yard pellet free this might be a good buy for you but it's not the wonderful product it was meant to be
3,pellet trap,"The supporting bar inside the trap had come out of the holding hole and I had a bit of a time getting it put back in. If it stay attached after shooting I will be a lot happier. Seems sturdy, though I will put a steel liner in the back of the trap just to make it a bit stronger."
1,not to good,"the reset button doesnt work, and the targets on the side automatically fall down without reset...not to good i'll buy another product, some reviews were good but maybe the one i got is faulty dont know but they should work well not some...so 1 star....on the hunt for another"
2,At minimum annoying . . .,"It is annoying to read ""experts"" on writing who apparently lack self-critique as concerns their own writing. As example:""Kora in Hell: Improvisations (Boston: Four Seas, 1920) is a unique work for its time and place. . .""Try this:""Kora in Hell: Improvisations (Boston: Four Seas, 1920) is unique for its time and place.""Now tell us why ""place"" is relevant, or delete ""and place"" from the sentence, though it would be better to strike any sentence which includes the word ""unique,"" it being one of the most over- and misused words in the language."
3,Tihs book is very repetitive,"I think the scope of this book is much too narrow for how long it is(over 600 pages). Not that the content was not interesting, just that he rephrased the same concepts over and over and over and over. You start to get that 'lovely feeling' that the author is trying to fill pages.Hancock likes to produce epic narratives, and I think he should have incorporated a wider range of more information and research into this book(or made it shorter)."
3,Just Okay,"I liked the book for learning to understand the various shaman traditions,I liked it for understanding the authors drug induced journies, but it dragged a little and not his best work. An okay read, but I would not give it the same literary applause I gave to The Fingerprint of the Gods....a much better read."
2,an investigation,"This book was not what I expected. It is a thorough investigation, but limited to the lower rungs of the dimension ladder."
5,One of my new favorite books of all time,"Graham Hancock is one of the most interesting thinkers of our time. Read the many other positive and detailed reviews on this site. His combination of bravery and creativity along with analytical skills and a stance of skepticism are a perfect formula for advancing knowledge about human history and origins. A role model for those laboring in more conventional and academic approaches to the same subject matter. I have no interest in ever having a hallucinogenic induced experience, but am thrilled to live in a time where I can read a comprehensive comparative point of view about what has been learned, and why humans may possess this innate capacity. For those fans of the show Ancient Aliens, you'll find this perspective is a surprise and equally compelling, exciting, and yet still mind-blowing alternative to much of the evidence put forward that we might have been visited from afar. This thesis deserves its own TV documentary."
4,Different side of Hancock,"Graham Hancock has always been open to unconventional ideas regarding alternative history (pseudo-archeology, if you like). In this latest tome, he dove into his own psyche through the use of psychedelics to find answers about the origins of human consciousness. He posits our ancestors discovered these psychedelics millennia ago and that this is a major driving factor in the development of our current state of mind or perspective regarding reality. This is a fascinating read regardless of what you think of this field of study. The expansion of Hancock's perspective is interesting and makes one think that more people should expand their perspective in this way."
4,Good Read,"A wonderful read. Extremely interesting and I would certainly recommend it. I only gave it four stars because Graham Hancock is afraid to reach any conclusions. He draws the picture in great detail, but fails to hang it on any perceptible frame. Although the information about spirits, aliens, goblins and angels is enthralling, the reader doesn't know where to go with it. So we are no wiser as to what is going on."
5,Super reading,"Graham Hancock is one of my favorite non-fiction writers, because he has a nose for subjects that really intrigue me. I remember his collaborations with Bauval that really angered the Egyptian authorities and spawned the science of archeo-astronomy. I also remember the work on Mars in which he described the asteroid impact that knocked off half the crust. Thought to be pretty silly at the time, this theory has recently been in the news as a working hypothesis. Maybe someday anthropologists will validate some of the ideas he's brought forth in this book. At any rate, Supernatural is a lot more fun than either Genesis or Darwin."
4,Be Challenged,I gravitate to writers who aren't afraid to explore areas that challenge the mainstream view. Mr.Hancocks does this with his books and it is truly mind expanding. Read this book and be challenged!
1,Absurdity piled upon absurdity,"From Talk:Francis Crick on Wikipedia: ""There are drug use advocates who attempt to link famous people and events to drug use and they can say anything they want without supporting their claims with evidence.""For myself, it is difficult to say which is more ludicrous: Hancock's hypotheses, or the statements made here by reviewers of his book."
5,Loved it!,"I have to admit, the beginning part started off slow and I was worried that I wouldn't like it, but overall it was completely fascinating. If you have any interest in history of shamans, fairies, visions, or anything of that sort, you would be crazy not to read this book."
2,Frank Miller would've made this awesome if he wrote it,"It is obvious from the first ten pages that you are left with the feeling that, if Frank Miller had written it, it would've rocked but instead it flopped. The poor writing is a complete turn-off and the ending is horrible. The only story in the book that I actually liked was the Daredevil vs. Hulk one. It was awesome and, although I am not a big fan of Frank Miller art, it was appropriate for the story but other than this, the book was not worth buying. I recommend Dardevil:Gang War which was written by Frank Miller as well as illustrated by him and that was plain awesome!!!"
2,Threw it away,"Originally this had high promise, but the top of the clip sticks out from the wallet, which can make it uncomfortable in your pocket. Also, after about two months, the clip wouldn't stay shut. Ended up buying a billfold from Fossil that was very compact and would still hold money securely. So far, so good."
1,Replacement replaced,I bought this wallet to replace an almost identical model I'd had for 8 years. This wallet tore within two weeks. I am now waiting on the slimslimmy wallet to arrive.
1,not a good product,"All I have had with this product is problems. the clip in the middle, kept popping open, even when it the wallet was close and my money would fall out, so i ended up removing the cheap clip and useing it for what ever. don't waste your money."
3,Less than awesome,"Bought this wallet/money clip for part my husband's Christmas gift. It appears to be much nicer in the item photos than the actual product I received. I will hang on to it for now, but probably keep looking. It was meant to replace a similar money clip wallet he already has which has lasted him for years, but I can tell this one won't stand the test of time."
3,wrong title,"I agree with the first review in many ways, but I just didn't respond to the author as much. As far as breathing exercises I liked Nancy Zi's video better, if you can compare video to audio. My main complaint is that he doesn't go into the concept of ""breathing as a metaphor for living"" at all. I was really looking forward to expanded thoughts on breath/life. Spiritual thoughts. Mythicalthoughts. Anything. No go, just exercises and a bit of biology. It reminded me of begrudgingly doing scales during my childhood piano lessons."
1,It should be called The Master Snoozer,"I saw this on TV many years ago and thought it was a made-for-TV movie. With good reason, it turns out. The plot develops at a glacial pace and is full of actions and motivations that don't make sense. For example, the actions of the hero's wife at the end of the movie are totally out of charcater, given what she's said and done earlier in the film. Rather improbably, the movie portrays early California as a sword culture coexisting with a gun culture, which allows the producer to deliver a combo Samurai flick and Gunfighter flick, with lots of the dramatic pauses for which both are noted. In fact, the plot plods along because it's so full of dramatic pauses you could almost say the whole thing was one big dramatic pause. The only redeeming feature of this movie was the beautiful scenery. It's not worth the price; I'm not sure it would even be worth half of what they're asking."
3,. . . but for the acting,"I just got this movie (which I only remember vaguely from my misspent youth, on DVD and was very well suprised by the fairly high-quakity tranfer to the DVD format (I was expecting something closer to They Call Me Trinity). This could even have been a great movie if it weren't fro the absolutely horrible acting (eccept from Superfly, of course) and worse fight coreography. Still, true fans of Billy Jack will have to own this, there won't be any choice. Just don't buy it for any reason other than nostalgia."
3,Billy Jack Goes West,"If you're looking for a sophisticated, well written and well acted western, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a unique western that will provide you with silly entertainment, get this movie. The movie can simply be described as a ""Billy Jack"" movie set in the old west and Billy Jack is armed with a samurai sword and a special revolver (and he, of course, knows how to use them both). If you're a fan of the ""Billy Jack"" movies or you're just looking to expand your 1970's cultural awareness, you'll enjoy this movie."
3,"Tom Laughlin ""The Master Gunfighter""","This movie is for true Tom Laughlin fans. It is not the typical kick butt and take names type of movie that Tom is known for. It has a pretty good story of old California and it shows the struggles that certain families had to go through to survive.Tom also shows his talents as a pretty good swordsman and the way he uses a six gun. There is not a lot of action in this movie, but what there is, makes it even better."
3,Actual running length?,Over on IMdb there is an unanswered discussion: re the time listed on Amazon description and on IMDB (121m) and the play time of the DVD and the space for it on a cable movie channel (apparently 100-110 minutes - an 11 or 21 minute length difference. Anybody here timed it?
1,error prone,This book is the first version of what could be a long and borring series. the problem is the consistancy in some aspects this book assumes a 5th grade reading level but in other segments a working research level of knowledge. The topics that are covered while signifigant in the field seem arbitary in selection and do not flow well togeather.
4,For Otis Sprinfield,My wife's grandfather was in the Tree Army.I bought the book for her. She enjoyed it very much. The pictures in the book were of places he was at. It gave her a real view of the life he lived in the C.C.C.
4,Barnyard Animals Aloft,"Starting with the historical facts of the first hot-air balloon ride, which took place in Versailles, France in 1783, Priceman lets her imagination - and illustrations - run wild. The first hot-air balloon aviators (i.e., the guinea pigs) were a sheep, a duck and a rooster. After a few introductory pages of text, Priceman depicts the flight with a series of wordless illustrations. The complex pictures lend themselves to careful inspection to catch all the elements of the story. In the end, our barnyard aviators land safely, which I hope this is one of the true facts of this story. 2006 Caldecott Honor Book."
3,Good Ilustrations,I found this book okay .... not much of a story for kids to enjoy .... my child liked the illustrations. I bought this book as a gift based on other reviews.... if i had a chance to look inside the book ... maybe i would not have bought it for the person i did.
1,If I Could Give It a Zero,"Purchasing this CD was a good lesson for me. I should have read the customer review. It was absolutely right. The songs included are by the groups indicated, but they are not the original recordings. Listen to Just Like Romeo & Juliet, a song I am very fond of, and the last note held is rather pitiful to say the least. These must have been recorded at least 25-30 years after the initial recordings. Denise is just awful. I would give it a zero if I could. I will be much more careful in the future."
1,BEWARE! CD can be broken!,I had to return 2 to Amazon. This is supposed to be the 60's but actually has 70's music burned onto it. Beware of the company.It would have been OK had it had the correct music on it.I am suprised Amazon has not removed it from their catalog yet.
1,One Star Is Too Much,"Beware Dominion Records' products! A CD like this contains no warning that the songs are not the originals. If that's okay with you, great--but most of us would like to know that what we're buying is legitimate. Find these songs elsewhere on better CDs."
2,It's only the 1st half of the class...,"It's a great series, but you have to go to iTunes to download the second half listed as ""Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class Vol. 2"", so you can do the complete class. Not sure what their thinking was since there is no way to find it here from amazon."
2,"Bikram, Please remake your CD's!","I greatly enjoy practicing Bikram Yoga, and I was so excited to be able to do it at home. I enjoy hearing Bikram's voice as well as his clear and consistent instructions. However, I do NOT enjoy listening to his often condescending remarks. The philosophy stresses the body/mind connection. How can I enjoy building a stronger body while feeling like his comments are negatively effecting my mind?Bikram, Please remake your CD's!"
3,A Decent Encyclopedia,"I picked this up at a local Borders on sale for $10. Being an animal lover and enthusiast, I figured what the hay. After looking it over, I realized the fish family isn't covered in the book. Which is kind of a downer but not a major gripe.The book is pretty good and covers a lot of species of animals. Problem is, the descriptions of most, if not all, of the animals is around 2-3 small paragraphs at most. It's not an extensive encyclopedia or a book that goes into great detail; just enough to cover the usuals of each animal.All in all, not a bad book but if you're looking for an in-depth book, this isn't going to be what you're looking for."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"Altough I love Dave's music and had the chance to meet him in various ocasions, I do not advise you to buy the video...It is boring, not close at all to the shows he does and the crowd was not into it at all...The only things worth it, are the extra videos they put in , like the You Make me Smile video that is very charming..."
4,Good solid soundtrack,Includes all the riveting music from the movie and will aid you in your own workouts or fights! I enjoyed the movie and having this soundtrack on my Ipod brings me back to the best scenes they represent.
1,A TUBBY SHE,"I have just watched this verion of ""She"". Dispite having writen ""dialouge"" straight from the novel plus following the story quite faithfully its a pitty that She herself is portraid as a middleaged overweight matron with no waistline, to add insult to injury Leo/Kallikrates is played by a big nosed weedy guy, no hint of a greek god here, it would have been better to send ms Andress back in time with a chippendale stripper for man candy (its silent film so who cares if he can talk!) were all people this ugly in the 1920s? im surprised that haggard himself was suposed to be part of the film production? Well its nice to know bad taste has no time zone. When are they going to do a dicent film version of haggards greatest story, the 1960s Hammer version towers over all other attempts so far. Perhalps this is one novel that just cant be filmed."
1,"Misleading Title and Misuse of the term ""Zen""","The title of this book is misleading. There is little, if any, meaningful Zen in this book. The title might more accurately have been ""The Etiquette of Tennis"". An example of a book that is truly infused with principles of Zen, such as staying in the moment and not being caught up in the past or future, is ""The Best Tennis of Your Life"" by Jeff Greenwald. That book is an example of a meaningful understanding and incorporation principles of Zen into tennis."
5,A Long Strange Trip Its Been,"Morigu the Dead was a long awaited, by me at least, sequel to an excellent book. It is filled with brilliant imagery and gives a nod to many so called pagan beliefs, brought to life in fiction of course. Mr. Perry is an inventive author who should seriously consider finishing the series, he would have fans falling over each other in their thanks. If you read this book and like it check out Mark E. Rogers and David Eddings as well."
4,I am not alone!,"Mr. Perry -- Just a quick word of thanks for keeping great fantasy tradition alive...for 2 books, at least.After plowing through works of the more famous authors (Tolkien, Anthony, Donaldson, Weis/Hickman, etc.) and finally coming across your [incomplete] series about a decade ago, I knew great fantasy writers were still out there.You are still out there, aren't you? It's been a wish of mine for many years that this series would find an ending, but the ending won't write itself.Best wishes that you're still hanging in there and won't leave your fans hanging.Sincere thanks."
5,I need to read the REST!!!,I read the first two many years ago...my efforts to get the rest have been futile. I've read many and none compare to this series. After several years I still yearn for more! Kudos to all who have actually read any of these!!
3,Depends on it's Purpose,"I bought this product after hearing good things about it. I am an amateur web graphics designer and was hoping I could use it for my graphics. I bought it and when I told my friend about it, she bought a copy to, to use to design her graphics. Well, she got the hang of it almost immeadiately but I still can't use it! The tools confuse me and never seem to work right. It also doesn't have brushes like PSP and Photoshop. You can use PSP tubes w/ PIP's stamp tool, but those aren't the same. Photo editing, that's a different story. It has great editing tools that are very easy to use. As an amateur photographer as well, it comes in handy sometimes. But overall, I think I will switch to PSP."
5,"love it, great deal, easy to use.. even pros recomend","I have bought this program over a year ago and still love it. I have just recently updated from a ps sony cam to a slr canon rebel cam and I still love photo impact, or better I love it even more. It is a great program and you can do a lot of special effect, color effects and so on. It comes with a few extra programs to organize and store pics as well. It has object converting which allows you to bring your pics to life..I dont think there is a better program out there especially for the price it is offered on here right now. I would def recomend and buy again."
4,Great Product,This is a great product that I have purchased several times through Amazon. I take this product for restless leg syndrome (per my doctors recommendation) and it really works. The taste is not bad - you get used to it and it's convenient to get your calcium and magnesium together by taking one to three heart shaped tablets (depending on your needs) rather than separate pills for both.
2,Not a pleasant taste,I didn't enjoy these. They aren't like candy - they are huge and chalky. My husband won't eat them at all. I had to start searching for another brand.
1,Very Disappointed,I had been waiting for this product to arrive. It came today and when I opened the bottle I found that the glue had dried and was not usable. I am pretty upset about this. I had expected this product to be in good and working condition. I advise others not to purchase this nail glue.
2,did not stick at all,"was excited to get this product in and was very disappointed. I dont know if I just got a bad one but it would not stick. So I decided to try to feel out the glue with my fingers and it wasnt even sticky!! Like I said I must have gotten a bad one. Wont got through the trouble of returning, just gonna count it as a loss."
2,nop it didn't do what I wanted...,my nails went off the 2nd day after wearing them.. if u buy try to use a lot of the glue to the nails!!!!
2,Not good,I hate this glue. I used it for acrylic nails and the nail came off the second day. I was really disappointing. The only good thing is that it was a brush style.
3,Okay,"This product is okay for the price. This product worked for a while then all of a sudden when I went to apply it again it was stuck in the tube of glue. Maybe the manufacture should think this one through. But for the price it is okay, and a buy if you need to use it for a one time project."
1,Worthless Collection of Rerecorded Songs,Don't waste your time on these rerecorded versions of Rich's songs unless you are a hardcore fan who doesn't mind alternate versions.
1,Not the original recordings,"It's Charlie singing, but not the recordings you remember. He re-phrases all the songs and the background band is cheesy souding. Very disappointed."
5,Excellent,"Lionel Richie, new cd is Excellent. Anyone that likes Lionel's music will love every song on his cd."
4,Good cd @}->---,"This is Lionel's 8th solo studio cd and it's been a little while for his fans, but now finally we have some great new music to hear. The first release, I Call It Love, is a really nice ballad (with his extra skinny daughter and CSI Miami's Adam Rodriguez in the video). It's a good start to the cd. The rest of the cd is really nice music, but not the fantastic music of his past where he would have strings of hits. It's a lot of Adult Contemporary music but still should have his fans enjoying it. Jermaine Dupri produced What You Are and that happens to be my favourite song here. I also really like Reason To Believe and All Around The World (a more upbeat Brazillian style song).This didn't grab me on my first listen through, but after a couple of goes, I'm really enjoying the cd and glad that Lionel is back again. I am a big fan of his and do enjoy this and hopefully his other fans will too and will even score some new fans."
4,Old school R&B back in the hizzouse.,This is a very good CD. I like every cut. Lyrically and rhythmically; this CD is a solid product.
5,Great Music,Wonderful CD. Have always enjoyed music by Lionel Richie and was anxious to hear this new CD. I was definitely not disappointed and loved it.
5,"""Lionel the Great""",This cd is going down as my one of my top music favorites.thoughtful intelligent and has got to be the best work Mr Ritchie has done yet........keep them coming Lionel!!!!!
5,Always a hit!,"After seeing the Coming Home song on one of the morning shows, I knew I needed to buy this CD for my husband who was coming home from Afghanistan.As always with Lionel Richie, I was not disappointed in all the music."
3,Coming Home,"This is the first Lionel Richie album I've bought in a long time and I bought it because of how much I enjoy the lead single, I CALL IT LOVE -although listening to it with headphones, the production & backing vocals kind of drown Lionel out it was still nice to see him chart again with such a pleasant mid tempo song.The other tracks that I really enjoy are: SWEET VACATION; WHAT YOU ARE; I LOVE YOU; OUT OF MY HEAD & UP ALL NIGHT.I think that the producers Lionel worked with successfully managed to contemporize songs without totally selling out his image by having guest rappers on the track to appeal to a much younger crowd. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised by the number of tracks I did like and would recommend this disc to Lionel's fans."
4,Lionel Richies,One of the only items ordered from Amazon that I actually received. Would suggest buying locally rather than ordering through Amazon; at least then you'll actually get what you're looking for!
4,AN EXCELLENT CD,"Some are criticizing Lionel Richie for working with modern day producers and artists on this release as if he is grabbing at straws trying to find a new sound.This couldn't be further from the truth. Whatever his age, Lionel has every right to make his music more modern. This cd is pure Richie and shines in 2006 the same as his classics did in the 70's and 80's. He has chosen excellent people to work with.I find all the songs fresh and very sincere - there are hints of the Commodores here and true ballad Richie. Also, the cd can stand up and hold its own with that from any younger singer.Huge kudos on this very fine project. I just can't give it 5 stars for it is rather short compared to other releases today."
1,I Apologize,"I don't like Lionel Richie. I don't know why. Maybe it was the wife thing a few years back that did it to me. Isn't it funny how a scandal can sometimes turn you off on a particular artist, and sometimes you just don't care. I'm sorry ... I don't know what happened to my feelings for Lionel. I mean, I loved the Commodores but I won't even listen to Lionel on the radio any more. So sorry."
4,Listenable,I found this CD to be very enjoyable and very listenable. I find myself when i want to listen something i am grabbing for this not a lot of memorable songs on it but nothing to make you take it off when you do play it.
2,it's aight,"huge Lionel Richie Fan. this Man could always write strong bridges&always under the ability to make Simplicity a Art. very crafty songwriter,Musician&Vocalist. it's been years since he has made a Album that I was knocked out by. 20 years ago with his 'Dancing on the Celing"" he was still in his Artistic Peak&prime though that album 20 years back was hit&miss as well. ""I call it Love"" is done by the same Producers behind Ne Yo's hit song""So Sick"" which fits Lionel's Vocals like a Glove. but this album doesn't enhance or take Lionel any place that he hasn't already been,but it just shows that he can stay modern. he did what he wanted with making a modern album,it's safe&fairly predictable&there is no shame in that,but Lionel Richie is better than that.He still sounds Good Vocally&can still write&knows a Hit."
1,An ineffective way to actually acquire another language,"I have studied 4 languages beside Portuguese and purchased this book thinking it might be useful. Actually, this book uses a vocab learning aproach that incoorperates the sound of portuguese words with English definitions of those words in English rhymes. For example, ""early"" (""cedo"" in Portuguese) might be presented as ""SAY DO you want to call Dave, and be EARLY for tomorrow's parade?"" Anyone familiar with language aquistion knows the most effective way to learn vocabulary is to define words in terms of images or vocabulary already aquired in the language. The idea of remembering a Portuguese word using English rhymes is silly and inappropriate for anyone seeking lasting mastery of the language. A real disappointment."
2,Exterior angularity= inferior irregularity,"2 1/2I understand how this Gentle-Giant-on-bad-acid-like vibe helped create the superior offspring in groups like Sleepytime Gorilla, but asides a few genuine tracks of fluid eccentricity, the stilted posturing still reeks of bitter artsy emptiness."
1,Would not buy again.,"Description states: 2 oz. container, 24 piece. I expected to receive 24 bottles, but got only one. Also does not work very well. Tried dipping in a glass of water, paste turned violet but the violet color stayed in the glass of water when I pulled the stick out. Not recommended, try kolos kut paste instead."
1,Bose 201s? Typical Bose joke speakers,"I've owned Bose 201s, 301s and 901s in my life. Then I began to get into speaker building kits. My eyes were opened. I began to learn about crossovers, tweeter construction, woofers and cabinet resonancy. I also began to seek out commercially sold speakers for ideas and for quality.That is when I began to see just what a joke Bose speakers really are. For the same price, consumers can get better quality sound, build and design from Polk, JBL, Infinity or Klipsch. And they are the commonly available makers.While the Bose 201s aren't as horrible a value as the 901s, you're still foolish to get these when much better higher quality speakers are out there.An indicator of Bose priority is the fact that their advertising budget is higher than their research budget. Hey, its your dollar, if you want to waste it go right ahead, but done't fool anyone else about Bose 'quality'."
1,Bose?,"A lot of people think that bose is the greatest. But have you ever went to a place like circuit city or ultimate electronics and asked a sales rep. what they think of Bose? I used to think Bose was the greatest until I heard them and compared them compared them to a speaker company like Infinity, for less! Bose do have their fans but stay away from Bose you will be happier. The drivers ( the actual speaker inside) on Bose are made of paper. Bose speaker also rely on reflecting sound so, if you don't have a square room you will be digusted with the sound and not even hear most of it. They also sound distorted at low and high volumes. Do not buy this speaker, don't waste your money."
4,Very Compelling,"I have only seen the first episode of Arjuna, as it was made available on a bandai promotional DVD given away at Otakon. Arjuna is a very compelling little story that although follows a different story line, reminds me very much of Escaflowne. Just like Escaflowne, Arjuna follows a struggling high school girl athlete as she takes a mysterious trip leading to what may hopefully become 26 episodes of Anime Goodness.Sharp mix of computer animation coupled with the painted cell artwork. In fact, This is the first Anime I've seen with this much CG effect. Great music, the opening track sounds like a slow paced Yoko Kanno original (although it is not)I am looking forward to the full release of Arjuna, I can only hope that Bandai rushes these out instead of torturing us with one volume every few months."
5,A BEAST!!!!!,"I had 2 of these hooked up to 1 orion 15"" H2. Its a great amp way better then the JL amps."
4,One of the best books about ginseng.,An excellent book that tells you how to use Ginseng. Has the recipe for a couple of oriental tinctures you can make yourself. If you are serious about using ginseng and want to know how to use it properly this book is a must-read.
4,M.C. Hammer 2 Legit: The Videos,These videos are from Hammers glory days. A couple duds but some REAL old school hits on this disc. Enjoy and flash back to the good old days!!!
3,"Its all good .........well, almost.","This is a great collection. I was however disappointed that it did not include the videos from Hammers Funky Headhunter album (Pumps and a Bump, Its all good, ect). I also wished it would have had and interview with hammer about the videos. Otherwise, to anyone who is a Hammer fan, this collection is pretty good. Buy it."
5,This A Good dvd,This Is A Very Good Dvd it has lots of mc hammers video's on here you won't be disapointed i wasn't .
5,enjoyable reading,"this book kept up pace until the end. Natalie a crisis pregnancy director becomes close to one of the teenagers that comes into the clinic seeking help. Linn, the pregnant teenager wants Natalie to adopt her baby. An interesting turn of events and a new man in Natalies life all make this book an enjoyable one. this is the second book in this series and i think the better of the two. Mending Places is book one. I look forward to #3 soon. Denise keep up the good work!!!"
1,"buyer beware, not original recordings","Buyers beware of this apparent blockbuster collection of great hits. For all those who seek original recordings of such hits, should refrain from buying this. I truly wish amazon would explain to potential buyers , that these classics are new recordings."
1,DON'T BUY THIS - RE-RECORDED BY ORIGINAL ARTISTS!,"The real Paul Revere listened to track 2 and is rolling over in his grave as we speak!Perhaps the artists want to relive their glory days or perhaps they don't have the rights to the original, so they re-record their 1-hit-wonder. Problem is that it is never ever -- i repeat, NEVER EVER AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL -- everyone else on this little blue marble knows it but they are oblivious!One artist covering another's hits or a live album by an artist is a different matter, but please, please, for your sake and mine, do not encourage this bad behavior. Do NOT purchase this album. It is much wiser to buy Millenium Collections, Singers & Songwriters series, Have a Nice Day 70's series, anything by Rhino, anything by Razor & Tie, TimeLife Gold, Pure Funk/70's/80's, VH1-80's.I'd give this a zero or a negative 10 if it were possible."
1,Another pitiful waste of plastic.,"Yet another sad rip-off, consisting mostly of very poorly re-made songs. As others have pointed out, there are only two original songs here, although Wild Thing seems to be the authentic original song that has possibly been stereo-enhanced. There is a typically hard to find, and read (printed sideways) disclaimer, in a corner on the rear label. But, why even bother desecrating these works of musical art by messing with them? Do the manufacturers of these kinds of CD's have no shame? Hmm...Evidently not... Bottom line, don't waste your money or time on these kinds of pathetic, ear torturing monstrosities. Do your research and find the ""original"" originals. Life is just too short to compromise. Wish Amazon had a zero stars option, as this deserves such a rating."
1,How do you know which series you'd actually receive?,The title is from a different series than the cover is from. Who knows what you'd receive if you bought it?
5,All That's Missing is The Harp,"Büdi Siebert spent some time in Andreas Vollenweider's band -- according to the liner notes, two albums and over 200 concerts -- so it should come as little surprise that this album reminds heavily of the Vollenweider Band, all except the harp.Multi-instrumentalist Siebert performs on marimba, woodwinds, keyboards and didgeridoo, with an international supporting cast on drums, strings, oboe, piano, bass and Ralf Illenberger on guitars. This is a joyful, upbeat music which is relentlessly happy without ever lapsing into being syrupy.Very congenial stuff."
5,Small pet exercise pen,We have a small yorkshire terrier who spends time in the pen while my wife and I are at work. We have the pen set up in or living room - it provides plenty of space for her to play with her toys and be comfortable for long time periods.
5,the best,"As a traveller and a reader, this is one of the best books i have read in a very long time."
5,Favorite author entertains yet again,"Martha Gellhorn was a daring war correspondent from 1939-1963 and lived her life to travel, engage in people's lives as they were affected by world friction and expose the realities of the effects of these conflicts on those whom the wars affected most. This particular book was a group of horror stories from travels gone wrong during Martha's career exposing some of the hardships of her world travels."
2,I guess you had to be there,"I liked the earlier work from Bobby Bare Jr.'s Young Criminals Starvation League, but I'm not on board his work with on The Longest Meow. Too often, it sounds as though Mr. Bare and company are pushing the envelop just to see what they can get away with, and the discordant dissonance that follows just isn't that much fun to listen to. I'm thinking everyone involved had a helluva good time in the studio cranking out 11 songs in 11 hours. But after trying to listen to the results, I guess you had to be there."
3,Randy!!!,"There are a handful of beautiful songs on this disc and Bobby has a gift for twisted lyrical tales. Love the sound of the slide guitar and the saxophone. Catch these guys live, the disc does not quite capture the magic."
1,"Total BS, stay away.",this is the same deal as the other review.... gonna call amazon and envoke that A-Z guarantee they offer.
3,J.F.K.The first news from Dallas,Good to start with but i found towards the end it became conspiracy bashing.After all that has been found out about certain people in high places you would expect a newspaperman to err on the side of caution
5,wow.,"Owning most of the 'Winter Chill' series and all of the 'Serve Chilled' series, I have come to expect impressive, extremely listenable quality music compilations from the absolutely amazing Hed Kandi label (shameless plug: www.hedkandi.com), but I was completely blown away by this offering, my first experience with `The Acid Lounge' series (which Hed Kandi refers to as its ""drunken uncle""). MAN, this stuff is smooth! Amazing. Buy it. Now. I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the albums in the series."
4,"Depending on what you oil use, it can be deliciously moist or unappetizingly bone dry","This cake mix can easily result in a deliciously moist or unappetizingly bone dry cake depending on the oil used. I used 1/2 cup of Canola oil in my first attempt to make this cake and it yielded a bone dry cake with an unappetizing flavor that seemed substandard even for a gluten and dairy free cake. In my second attempt to make this cake I used 1/4 cup of Olive oil and 1/4 cup of Coconut oil and it yielded a moist cake with the most delicious flavor and mouth feel! It was even indistinguishable from normal chocolate cake! After refrigeration, the moist cake became dry, likely because of the coconut oil that hardens in cooler temperatures, but quickly reverted back to its deliciously moist self when warmed.I would happily cook with this cake mix again and serve it to my non-allergen-challenged friends and family!"
1,Yuck!,"I do a lot of gluten-free baking, and I'm always on the lookout for products to make this more convenient. I love to bake, but sometimes, I'm too busy to want to do everything from scratch. This mix made terrible, terrible cake. It was spongy, rubbery, and had a strange bitter, chalky aftertaste (I blame an excess of starch in the flour mix). It did not taste like chocolate at all. All I can say is that I will never buy this again, and I'm glad I tried a bite of it before wasting frosting on it!"
4,Jeff's Review Of Swiss Miss Cocoa Mix!,"This product is one of my favorite, cocoa mixes has great taste, just the right amount sugar with marshmallows and a savory chocolate. A winter treat! Excellent value for the price, without a lot of calories."

4,pirate booty flag,This flag is fun and good quality. I think it's so funny! Perfect for an adult pirate-themed party!! I would definately buy the other flags too!! This one is for sure my favorite design!
2,pirate flag,i was very disappointed thought it was 3x5 so could hang from kids fort . it was only 12 inches by 18 inches did not give measurements but sld with other flags 3x5
1,I want my 92 minutes back!,"Absolutely the worst plot - OK, maybe tied with Solarbabies as the worst plot ever.So let's get this straight. You're a genetic scientist, you get your secret governmental funding from some upstart Navy commander who pays for your project out of petty cash and that empty coffee can next to the bottled water, you create giant carnivores to feed the world, left your daughter trapped on a deserted island with afore mention beasts for a meeting that you could have used your 1920's era two way radio for, power the ""electric fence"" and your only defense with a Honda generator the size of a shoebox, just happen to keep extra guns and explosives in that old shack a few miles away, know how to assembly any weapon but cant hit the broad side of a barn, just happen to keep some grain alcohol on hand for those downtrodden commando helicopter pilots that stop by for brunch, and you cant wait to sacrifice yourself to save the love of your life.Right...... It all becomes so clear now."
3,"Has to be seen with the ""sequel""","This film, and it's ""sequel"" Komodo vs. Cobra, should be seen together. It raises the humor value. No, they aren't great films, or even very good, but they do have quite a bit of humor. Take Paul Logan for example. I recognized him right off the bat as a porn actor. In this film he's a crook, Drake. In the sequel, he's Major Frank, a short-lived victim. Glori-Anne Gilbert and Ted Monte are also in both films. And of course the house is in both, along with the poorly done cgi(?) Komodos.Know what I think? I think they took a crew to Hawaii, made a couple of films and stayed around to do some porn as well. Just my opinion.The best thing in KVC was Michael Pare. What a great voice, and oddly, he was there for comic relief as well as heroism.Anyway, both films are about a 3, just for the humor, T&A; (in this one) and comedy. There are identical lines between the military general and his foil in both films. In conclusion, good Saturday fare, and at a decent price.Pegleg"
3,Above Average Low budget Flick,"This is one of the very few flicks that I know that contain a Komodo Dragon as the monster. It was quite good for its standards. Like many people say in their reviews, if you do not expect to much you might enjoy this kind of movies. But one of the many things I do not like in these kind of movies in general its the out of place nudity. I do not really see the need to put this kind of stuff in these films. And even though there are many other issues, I'm not going to list them (maybe because I would not finish). As for the CGI, its not the best but I have seen worst."
3,As movies go....,"Not really, really bad. Just mostly bad, the (nice) tits being shown are entirely gratuitous and have no possible reason for being in the movie, except to show them.The Komodo's are reasonably well done and the acting is pleasantly dreadful. A solid single Olive rating, meaning it would only take one martini to get me to watch it again."
3,Fun but low,"Its a fun movie to watch bad animation Giant Komodos attack and eat people. Its fun that they are stuck on an island with a whole bunch of em. But the film does nothing to truely draw you into the story. but its fun.A Group scientists are working on a formula to increase crop growth throughout the world to feed countless starving. The bad thing is they were contracted to do it by the US department of Defense. What does that tell you. Thats right, they want it as a weapon. They begin testing of its properties on animals, namely, komodo dragons. And it works but the komodos get out and begin a raign of terror on the island and our heroes are caught in the middle.Its your basic Low-Budget Cable film. Crappy CG, a plain story and pletty of gore. But its not one you will really love. But i do suggest renting it at your local store if your a fan of this type of film."
1,Extremely dumb movie with some Russ Meyer style twists.,"I'll only hype up the few fine points in this one. Russ Meyer style woman, decent CGI Komodo Dragons.OK I will also include what this movie lacks. A good screenplay. ""Curse of the Komodo"" should be called ""Curse of the Dodo,"" as in Dodo bird because this film is dumb and completly lacks everything that makes a good movie, except for the Russ Meyer type of ladies. O ya there is a blatant nude scene just because there can be. The nude scene is the pretty long and enjoyable to watch. Beware, watch this only for laughs and please don't expect much of anything."
3,DRAGGIN THE DRAGON,"CURSE OF THE KOMODO is not one of the worst movies I've seen, in fact it's a lot better than some of my colleagues avow. However, the problem is the script; it takes too much time with dialogue when we should have more komodo action. Tim Abell, usually fun to watch, underplays his role so much he comes across as bored. William Langlois as the responsible scientist isn't gung ho enough; Melissa Brasselle and Gail Harris are almost interchangeable and don't seem as frightened as they should be; Jack Logan looks great in his muscle shirt, but he needs to work on his acting abilities. It's derivative and incoherent, but the special effects are actually pretty good 95% of the time. I found it entertaining, worth a rental at least."
1,UGGGH!!!!,"""Night of the Komodo"" poses quite a few questions to the viewer, like what is the bigger thing in this movie, the Komodo, or the breast implants adorning the female stars, or could it be the false eyelashes also found on our damsels in distress? Another question posed; is red an actual eye color? The hero/head casino robber/muscle bound star looks like he just finished toking up before each scene and his eyes were the bloodiest part of this lame flick. The storyline is assinine, a doctor supposedly trying to create giant food, mistakenly creates these giant Komodo dragons instead, chalk that one up in the ooops column. I should have known better than to buy this turkey, but it was only $2 used, so once again I was subjected to a direct to video, ""hey guys I borrowed my brother's camcorder let's go make a movie"", lame excuse for a film. You know your in trouble when the movie begins and it's shot on video and not film!!! Avoid this thing at all cost!"
5,This book is a truly motivational and inspiring read.,"Famous talk show host Oprah Winfrey reveals the regime she followed that changed her body and her life forever. With the help of her trainer and exercise physiologist, Bob Greene, the two collaborated on the development of an easy to follow, ten-step program, of diet and exercise. The program is constructed to fit easily into any daily routine. Greene explains, at length, why daily exercise and proper nutrition are essential in leading a healthy and happy life. The book combines both the intellectual expertise of Greene, as well as, the positive encouragement of Winfrey. As Oprah explains, the only way to become physically fit is through self-acceptance. By reaching a true understanding of this concept, one can finally ""make the connection."""
5,lose the ugly fat start to live again,At 270 pounds I felt I was doomed to be a fat slob. After reading the book and listening to the tapes I was completely motavated to make the con nection. It really works. So far I have lost 120 pounds. I still have 50 pounds to lose to reach goal weight. I THANK Oprah and Bob for giving me my life back. If you follow the ten steps and change the way you feel about food you will start losing that ugly. Remember start now tommorrow never comes.
5,Best Book I have ever read!,"I love this book. I also use it in conjunction with the ""make the connection"" video. The best sound advice out there. There are no magic pills or quick fixes here. Hard work and determination are the key. It is ultimately about ""self-love"". I highly recommend it!"
5,Tracey from the UK,I found this book really inspiring. Every time I feel a bit low and have given up on the exercise/diet I just read this and it gives me a bit of kick to start again. I bought this whilst on holiday in the States and since I got back every friend has wanted to read it and I haven't seen it for a month.
3,Common sense,"Much of what the book explains is common sense, but it did share some important points about a successful weight loss program. It was very entertaining. My biggest complaint is with step 6: Limit or eliminate alcohol. Never!!!"
3,Make the connection: 10 steps to a better body and a better life CD,"This is a great CD collection for motivation and fitness. I loved hearing Oprah's voice, it made me feel like she was talking just to me. I feel the 10 step plan is a Great plan. I originally got this from the library and bought it for my mother. She will love it."
1,Trendy and pathetic,"How sad that a successful, well-liked, talented, beautiful woman presents the ultimate goal in life as going from being controlled by those who harmed her in youth to being controlled by a trainer! The reviewer who stated ""you can't lose weight if youn eat like a pig"" has a contemptible view of those overweight, but that is to be expected when Oprah places such stress on what is a totally invalid viewpoint - but, for her, a most profitable venture."
2,Not as good as the other ones,"For some reason, this installment in the series of novels about the ladies of Hope Springs Church did not strike the same chord in me that the other novels do. And I love this series. I felt it didn't go deep enough into the reasons for the departure of one of the characters, it was just ""tacked on"" at the end, when it seemed like that character would spend the entire book questioning her position (it's not that I don't agree with what she did, I do, and she handled it better than I would, it just seems like they would spend more time on it).I do love the author's way of framing each chapter with a problem that needs to be solved, and I dearly love these characters. I wish these books would get more exposure, since they are charming novels that leave me with a sense of peace when finished."
2,Letterpillar - doesn't stack up to other Leapster games,"While my 3 yr old and 5 yr old play this game some, it doesn't compare to the other cartridges we own. There is only one game on the cartridge. It is simple, and I'm not convinced it has much educational value, as do most of the other Leapster games we have. I recommend you buy the Draw & Write or the Letter Factory. My children fight / ""take turns"" over those two games and they are educational."
2,It's educational,We bought cartridge for our 3 year old. We were going on a airplane trip and thought it would keep his attention. He used it for only 5 minutes and wanted the creature creation cartridge. He may get more into this one when he gets older.
4,Good educational tool for little kids - learning letters.,My 4 & 5 yr olds love playing this game & eating all the letters. It is a fun tool for kids to learn with.
2,Don't Buy This Leapster Cartridge,"If you're looking for a leapster cartridge that is worth the money & has real educational value, do not buy the Letterpillar Cartridge game. It is a huge disappointment. My son played it for 5 minutes & got bored. He already knows his letters, but I thought this cartridge would offer the chance to learn words, or find letters to make words. It doesn't really offer much educational value except to find letters instead of numbers. We're sending ours back to Amazon for reimbursement because it's such a disappointment."
4,Littleset Pet Shop,Fast service and we had been looking for this toy for some time. Very pleased to have found it on your site. We would shop there again.
2,This is not holistic or mature...,"When a new edition of this text came out, I was hoping for some improvement. My main criticism is that it is advertised as being ""holistic"" and for ""mature"" readers. This edition has an average reading level of between grades 9 and 10 for the essays according to the manual and is loaded with isolated exercises that are the antithesis of holistic reading. The other problem remains to be the fact that the majority of the readings are 3 pages or less and there is an absence of higher level thinking. The only reading material that is above the 9th and 10th grade level are textbook chapters which simply provide for more busywork for the students who should be to applying reading strategies to their own textbooks.I am still seeking a college level reading text that actually is holistic and contains college level readings that challenge students. A good instructor should raise the reading competencies of the students and this book cannot do that at the college level."
1,Can't get past the sound.,"Picture quality of this VCI DVD is okay, what I have seen of it, but unfortunately I have never been able to complete watching it on the three occasions I have tried, due to the atrocious sound quality. A different DVD player was used each time I tried watching it, so it is not the equipment I was playing it on. Other reviewers do not seem to have had this problem, so maybe I just got a dud DVD - just my luck. In any event, this is the worst quality VCI DVD I have ever purchased. What I have been able to watch of the film is interesting - maybe one day I will get to watch the rest somehow."
3,Unique Period Piece,"Although the poor sound certainly leaves much to be desired, this remains an interesting movie capturing a specific period during the years immediately following WWII. I saw ""Four in a Jeep"" many years ago on TV. I was fascinated by the images of Vienna and the living conditions of its citizens. At the time I first viewed this movie I knew that Berlin was partitioned into four zones after the war, but had no idea that Vienna experienced the same situation. Too bad this remarkable period piece was not restored. Both the picture and sound desperately require substantial repair. I guess they only commit the funds for restoration for more well-known films. To watch this in its present condition is difficult at best. English subtitles for the entire movie would have helped. I recommend you pass on this until a better version is released if ever. Peace."
5,Typical Ehrman balance and persuasiveness,"As with his other histories of the time periods that were crucial for the development of the New Testament, Bart Ehrman gives us a balanced and persuasive analysis of the historical facts. Some might question why such a book is needed. After all, the Da Vinci Code was meant to be fiction. Are we just beating up on a fiction author who takes ""poetic license"" with history? Few people were particularly concerned that some of the charcters in ""Braveheart"" actually lived years apart. In the case of the Da Vinci Code, though, it is necessary. The popularity of the Da Vinci Code or The Passion of Christ (ironically, another Mel Gibson project), make these works more than mere pieces of fiction. Such a calm consideration of actual history should be required reading for anyone who will base their religious opinions upon the fictional works. While we're at it, someone also please send copies of all Dr. Ehrman's work to Mr. Gibson."
3,Balanced and Comprehensive Books on DVC Exist,"While I certainly have respect for Dr. Ehrman, I think it ought to be mentioned that we published a book which covers not only the religious controversies, but also the art and history issues, in a very balanced way. The book is Secrets of the Code: The Unauthorized Guide to The Da Vinci Code, by Dan Burstein. He headed a team of scholars and journalists--something like 40 or 50 all told--and they either wrote for the book, contributed existing work, or were interviewed. Among the interviewees was Dr. Ehrman.Disclaimer (of course): I am one of the lesser authors of Secrets of the Code."
2,Nit picking for Bible scholars,"From the title I was expecting to read about the Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code. What I read about is a bunch of nit picking about some esoterica what would only interest a Bible scholar. On some of the more interesting topics such as Opus Dei, The Priory of Zion, or even as in the title Da Vinci there was nothing. Having listened to the Teaching Company ""Historical Jesus"" I know that very little written literature exits from the time of Jesus about Jesus. The gospels were largely written in Greek, a language that Jesus probably did not speak, many years after his death. Certainly all the childhood stories in ""Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code"" have to be fiction but were not labeled as such. I was mislead and disappointed."
1,Not Worth the MONEY,"This book is a one-sided argument of history against a ficitional character in The Da Vinci Code. The Holy Blood, Holy Grail is a more detailed research project on the subject even if you don't agree or disagree with the subject. I must say this book will probally be awarded with blessings by the Pope........."
3,"After all, it is a novel!","While I appreciate Bart's scholarship and have devoured other books he has written, I was disappointed in the tone of this book. As much as I champion feminine spirituality, the novel in question is, after all, a novel, for goodness sake! Enough already!"
2,"Extreme Plot Confusion In A Short, Painful Package","""Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy"" is a terrible black and white Mexican horror film featuring some of the worst acting, worst plot development, and lamest monsters in film history. The plot combines elements of Mexican history loosely interspersed with typical horror movie plot devices like reincarnation, virgin sacrifices, evil scientists, an ancient mummy, and one of the stupidest robots ever. The sets are awful, the plot holes are enormous, everything is so dark that it's virtually unwatchable, and the climactic fight between the robot and mummy is among the worst choreographed (and slowest paced) I have seen.Some people may be able to view this as a ""so bad it's good"" movie, but I mostly found it tedious and boring, with insufficient camp value to redeem it. If you think it might be worth a look as a bad-cinephile, go ahead and have a go, but I recommend trying the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version to make it (a bit) more palatable."
1,Dreadful,"You might think that with a title like ""Robot Vs the Aztec Mummy"" this would be a terrible film.You would be correct."
1,Completely terrible,"Dr. Krupp (Luis Aceves Castanda) is your typical mad scientist who is hellbent on taking over the world as he steals forbidden treasure from an Aztec temple unleashing an ancient mummy of a king named Popaca (Angel Di Stafani) who goes on the rampage trying tom get his treasure back. In the mean time, the authorities are searching for him and Krupp invents a robot to destroy the mummy.A totally ridiculous and out of place 1957 Mexican Sci-fi horror clunker with terrible acting, a stupid as hell plot, bad special effects including a laughable robot and of course a character who looks like an early Freddy Krueger. I'm so glad MST3K chose this movie cause it was perfect because this dull and unexciting b-movie is what they needed to riff."
1,BOSE - Buy Other Stereo Equipement,"Bose has made a name for itself through agressive advertising at the expense of quality audio technology. Simply put, there are dozens of audio loudspeakers on the market that outperform Bose at a fraction of the price. This has been a well known fact in the audio industry and among audio buffs for at least twenty five years.Unfortunately the mass of consumers isn't aware of the quality problems with Bose as compared to other speakers on the market. A few years ago Consumer Reports gave an honest appraisal of Bose speakers- ranking them very low. Bose sued and lost. Now all reputable audio magazines such as Stereophile or Absolute Sound stay far away from Bose products.If you are really interested in sound performance and you'd like to stay on amazon.com try JBL, Polk, Wharfedale or Cambridge Audio. While not cutting edge audio, they'll deliver a MUCH BETTER sound performance than Bose could ever aspire to."
2,Cannot listen for a long time without fatiguing your ear...,"Bose is over rated in the mind of consumers due to their aggresive marketing stretegy. Ask any audiophiles what they think of Bose. There are other companies that make better spaekers like:Wharfedale diamond series with kevlar conesParadigmPsbMB QuartNHTBoston Acoustics A26Pioneer SP-BS41-LRGo with one of those, and you will be pleasantly surprised...Happy listening to you all..."
4,Great for price,"I bought this product about 2 yrs ago(still works like when i first got it), and for the price of $99.99 made it completely worth the value since the lower end mini docks go for like 59.99 to 79.99. This system goes very loud for how small it is at max volume with my windows open you can hear it from a block away. A couple problems are remote control sucks ass(cant skip songs consistently). but it doesn't matter cause i bought a 6 foot 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux stereo cord from frys for like $5. what works well are power (on/off) | volume | play pause | imput selector | and presets. I have a small amount of hiss but only audible when nothing is playing. so if you can get this for less than $200 I'd go for it. Also the sub in this package is way better than i expected it packs some punch but not like a full stereo surround one does... for that go with panasonic, onkyo, or sony"
2,Does not work with 3G Ipod,"Despite what the Amazon description says, the product instructions clearly state that this item isn't compatible with the 3G Ipod.Sound is excellent for the price and it works very well with video Ipod. I also like that it has an auxiliary input and radio functions.Remote has poor range and can be frustrating to use. Remote Forward and Back buttons are worthless."
1,terrible hiss!! don't buy it!,"i took it home, plugged it in, and you could hear a loud hissing noise from up to 4 feet away. just awful."
1,terrible hiss! don't buy!,"i took it home, plugged it in, and you could hear a loud hissing noise from up to 4 feet away. just awful."
4,Perfect little bookshelf system,"This works great in my son's room. The subwoofer really rounds out the sound nicely, and the iPod integration is great. I would definitely buy this again."
2,Great sound BUT not control of Ipod Video,It has great sound but is a pain to try to change the songs on the IPOD VIDEO. You have to change it directly in the Ipod so the remote control only manage the volume.Something that I didn't figure it out is how turn off the automatically star on. It play itself and I don't know how turn this off.CIZ
1,Looks beautiful. Quality is TERRIBLE.,"This system looks nice and perfectly matches the color and finish of the iPod, but the quality leaves much to be desired. It has terrible radio reception. If you connect a sync cable to the unit, the remote no longer works. And worst of all, the cheap speakers produce a terrible hissing noise that can be heard from several feet away. This hissing noise NEVER goes away, even if you have the system muted. I really suggest you look elsewhere. This product is not worth buying."
5,Shaun Davey Magic,"I absolutely love this film and the music with it. I love the music Shaun has written for the songs Shakespeare wrote, the use of strings, pipes and drums (especially in the final track) really invokes a sense of revelry and festival.I love the songs from this play - especially 'O Mistress Mine,' 'I am Gone Sir,' and 'The Wind and the Rain' and the soundtrack adds them in perfectly - no editing, cutting out, or lack of these songs, which I think, makes this film. I hate the soundtracks out there that leave the best song from the film out of it - this CD does not do that!"
1,Why can't we listen to the music ?,I wish we could sample this CD. That way we will know if we like it or not. Thanks.
5,MAGNIFICENT,"Do little girls need their daddy's? Can a single mother play and provide the role formother and father? Is the war with black men and black women, or do we rise above theignorance to heal our children. WATCH THE FILM, Mr. Morton has a talent that bringsinsight, depth, and conviction to change!"
2,Great Place to Start,"I am pleased with the content, style and purpose of this documentary and effort of Mr. Morton. I can utilize this film in my profession of Counseling African American males in the Criminal Justice System. I would classify this effort as a ""Victim Impact"" awareness film. I hope Vol II has more substance with respect to more in-depth interviews with women and girls who continue to struggle in their relationships even though they are no longer dependent on their mothers or guardians for support.How this issue has affected them in other areas of life and interpersonal skills. This is a great film to just get the dialogue started which is much needed in the Black Community. Looking forward to volume II.Mr. Williams CAC"
2,Not verry good.,"Smell Of Rain was a way better record. Grudge is blase, lacking in production, and hardley worth keeping in my CD collection. I hope his next album is beter."
4,Very Good Album But Miss Old Mortiis,"I personally think Mortiis was better when he did albums like the Stargate but then again I am a very hard hitting music fan. I love all forms of music and even though you could never tell that Mortiis did the Stargate and the Grudge unless you are familiar with him already. While I know most Mortiis fans are disappointed with this album because of what they had come to expect from this talented artist I am very proud to say that I have fully enjoyed this album and have listened to it several times and have not gotten tired of it. It is industrial and I love industrial music. If you love Mortiis' older albums and not into NIN, Ministry and other industrial bands you will NOT like this. If you do you will enjoy this album most likely like I did."
5,Mortiis continues to excel.,"I bought this album not knowing exactly what to expect as I hadread it would be different from his last masterpiece ""Smell ofRain"". This Cd is alot more industrial in its sound and it tookme a few listenings to appreciate what a great cd this is.Buy this and go ahead and get ""Smell of Rain"" while you're at it."
2,Reznor dressed for halloween,"i liked Mortiis [although i always considered his near-to-40-minute cds a ripoff]. i liked his versatility. i liked much more Vond and Cintecele. but when an artists calls his previous work ""suck3d a55"" then i start to think he's not reliable. and when that same artist improves only his make up and choses to become mainstream at any cost then i think he should go back to his castle, lock the portal and swallow the key...now, this cd does not stink... good industrial metal ... its only my personal animadversion to jumping-from-one-style-to-other musicians.what's coming up next, goblin? a mariachi cd?"
4,"High Quality, Brilliant Performance, Weaker message","I thought this was a wonderful album which grows on you each time you listen to it. These people are wonderful, talented musicians who produce a product that many enjoy and relate too. Not as much variety on this album (as Jesus Freak) and the message is toned down too much. I don't know whether that has to do with their new label or not. Time will tell! Overall, outstanding."
3,Okay,"I have to admit I was really disappointed in this one. After ""Jesus Freak"", which I think is one of the greatest music cd's ever created, mainstream included, it was a let down. It seems to me the guys got lost in trying to make it sound cutting edge, when what made ""Jesus Freak"" so awesome were its awesome melodies, combined with a mainstream sound. This cd does have it's good moments. It's still, in my opinion, a good cd, but only when compared to most Christian music."
5,SUPERnatural experience,"I first heard dctalk at the Papal Youth gathering in St. Louis. I thought they were talented, but I wasn't very interested. One day, I got free tickets to see their 2nd to last concert in St. Louis. I almost didn't go because I couldn't find people to go with me. I did, and they were amazing! That night, I looked them up on the internet, listened to the samples from this cd, and I was hooked. I bought it today, and I love it! Thank you Toby, Mike, and Kevin for the great music!"
5,The Christian meaning and good beat is the best in a while.,When I first put this in my cd player i was blown away it is a really awesome cd (as with the others.)and I hope DC talk puts more and MORE Albums out.
4,"Supernatural is great, but what's up with ""Consume Me""?","Very good record from dc Talk, a worthy follow-up to their masterpiece ""Jesus Freak"" from 1995. The CD features tight harmonies by the trio and inspired guitarwork from Pete Stewart (this was the embryo for the band Tait). Just one point. I know dc Talk aren't devil-worshipers, but it does sound like ""consumed with satan"" near the end of ""Consume Me."" I know people have claimed it's Kevin's voice that says the word (It's actually Michael's), and that the two voices cross over and make ""you"" and ""So let me tell you ..."" sound like ""satan."" I've met Michael twice, and know from that, his show and his music that he believes in God. It's just an odd-sounding part in the song. If anyone has the official word on this part of the song sounding like ""satan,"" please enlighten us concerned fans."
5,The best CD ever!,"DC Talk is the best band ever from there CD ""DC Talk"" to ""Supernatural"" I have loved them. Not only have the words been encouraging but between Mike, Kevin and Tobi you can't ask for better voices. Supernatural is the best CD that I have ever had and I love it! Consume Me is my fav. song it describes exactly how I feel. God is obviously no doubt working in DC Talks lives and they have certainly been a blessing to me. Into Jesus is my second fav. song and then Red letters. Since I met you , and all of the rest of the CD is awesome too. If you havent gotten ""Supernatural"" yet I encourage you to get it, it was a blessing to me and no doubt will be a blessing to you. I am just awaiting a new CD from DC Talk to top Supernatural. If its possible. God Bless."
3,Losing F O C U S,"OK, the music's great, there's no denying that. But, it seems that dcT is, like, doing it for the money now. I mean, ""dive"", ""it's killing me"" and others aren't really clear about how they are Christian songs. ""Red letters"", ""Into Jesus"", and ""Supernatural"" (my favorite track) are awesome, though. But remember Free at Last, their old CD? It was ALL really clear about being Christian."
4,Not as spectacular as Jesus Freak,"Hey - I'm as big of a dc Talk fan as they come, and even though this is a excellent album, it doesn't live up to Jesus Freak. If you are new to dc Talk, i recommend starting out with Jesus Freak before giving this album a listen."
3,"So Long, Friend","I prefer old school dctalk - this cd is not one of my favorites, but then i liked dctalk before they were popular, but if you like old school dctalk you probably won't like this one as much."
2,BOOOOOOO ! ! !,"Okay I loved dc talk , nu thang , free at last . When I picked up Jesus freak I said wait wait what ?!?! But at least it had some rap . I hoped dc talk would go back on the hip-hip thing , so I bought this . NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RAP ! I can't believe it ! Dc talk left everything ! But at least toby mac makes momentum ! Please do not buy ."
2,Not so super; far too natural,"After ""Jesus Freak"", I guess there was maybe only one way to go... Somebody who knows these boys well ought to remind them that they got where they are by writing catchy tunes which got people thinkin' about Jesus. One gets the impression with this disc that they have begun to take themselves far too seriously. They believe, apparently, that they are poets. They are not."
4,"Good, but no Jesus Freak","I like it. I was especially impressed with Wanna Be Loved, Into Jesus, & Red Letters. I still like Jesus Freak better, though. This album lacks the creativity and the variety of Jesus Freak. The songs also seem even darker. But, it's still a good album and I will still recommend it."
5,IT's Awsome!!,"The song SUpernatural is awsome! So is Fearless, Since I met You, Into Jesus, My Friend, THEYRE ALL GREAT!!! THis is they're best ALBUM EVER!!!"
4,first couple tracks are good,"The first couple of tracks are really good but then the record falls a little short after ""My friend (so long)"""
5,Reminiscent of the 60s,"THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM! I've been listening to it since December and haven't tired of it yet! The lyrics, vocal arrangements, the diversity of musical styles: Dive (Duranish); Consume Me (Sealish); Red Letters (Beatlesque); Since I Met You (Punkish). Is it just me, or are there a number of songs that have 60s-style arrangements? (e.g., It's Killing Me and The Truth)? I love it!And, MOST IMPORTANTLY, the message is as human and straightforward as ever!As for Satanic references...I seem to recall, back in the day, that a certain gentleman proclaimed that a certain member of a certain British pop group was actually DEAD because of misunderstood lyrics and innocent poses on album covers.Well, Paul's NOT dead..And Michael's NOT ""consumed"" by Satan. Just ask them.BUY THIS CD; YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
3,Let's Rock,"DC Talk has come a long way since their first CD. After their huge success with Jesus Freak, Supernatural is a CD that will rock your world. It provides such a variety of styles that it will appeal to almost everyone's taste. There is a downside I feel. Some songs, I feel, have somewhat hazy messages. But overall, Supernatural has made it to my top-10 list and I'd recommend it to everyone."
4,Grows like algae on you...,"...not that it's that's bad having algae on you. But seriously, this album gets better the more you listen to it. I'm not generally into rock/ alternative but this one's great for certain times of the day when you need to bop around!"
5,Like The title says Its Supernatural,"I LOOOOVE this CD. The have got a great mix of styles with it, one of my Personal favorites on this CD is DIVE and the title track SUPERNATURAL. The biggest hit though is MY FRIEND (So Long). This song talks about someone who was really close to God fading away from him and asks the most important question..... Why??? Their song GODSEND sounds like its mainly going out from Kevin (one of the members) to his new wife. This is a straight up must bye now gotta have this cd. I rated this CD with 5 stars, but thats only because they didnt have 10 stars. Anyways like I said, you`ve got to have it. You will definetly love it."
5,BEST CCM ALBUM EVER?,"CCM magazine did the issue last summer with the 100 Best CCM albums and Amy Grant's Lead Me On was #1 and deservedly so. well i have been comparing and it is REAL close. It is EASILY the finest christran album of the year, and Jesus Freak is worlds away. The songcraft on this record is stunning. Dynamic and diverse, this record should be lauded as the Sgt. Pepper of CCM. It has redefined the genre, set a new standard, [insert your tired but completely applicable cliche here]. According to my vote,for what it is worth, we have a new king. (not King, btw cause that is still God) Tristram Coffin"
5,Simply...Supernatural...,"5 starz?¿? Thats all I can give it? I just bought this album and...wow...Although its MUCH different from their last album, ""Jesus Freak"", This stuff just grows on you! What else can I say??¿?? Im addicted...=)"
5,Supernatural Rocks!!!,"People may have said that Supernatural isn't exactly a ""Jesus Freak"" type album, but people have forgotten that no matter what the beat, God's word is being spread. Just because it's not being spread with heavy metal doesn't mean it's being spread the wrong way. Besides Supernatural has some great hits like My Friend(So Long), Since I Met You, and of course the title cut Supernatural. These great tunes deliver God's word in a way that the words move with the beat and listeners can move to the beat as they take in the inspiring words. Supernatural Rocks!!!"
2,no title,"I used to own this cd.wow.I even went through few phases in the course of a year in which i actually enjoyed it.Then i realized somthing.This ""band"" spent three years making a very mediocre record.Now,somehow,I acually miss the cd.Thinking about it,i do find ""My Friend(So Long)""and some other tracks ""interesting"".In summary,this album contains some ok rock/pop;but don't waste your time."
1,DCTalk Needs to Stick to One Style,"This cd would have been worthy of five stars if all the songs were up to the caliber of ""Fearless"" ""Supernatural"" and ""Red Letters."" However, they jump from style to style and does nothing but confuse the listener as to what kind of group they are listening to. Their Jesus Freak cd was a much better example of just how superb this group CAN be. Still, it is worth buying simply because the above mentioned three songs exhibit quality musicianship"
1,A challenge,"Ok, if they are not Satanic as some of you claim. What are they saying in Conume Me 4 min and 3 seconds into the song? If you can't find a valid answer than that speaks for itself."
1,Freakin' annoying! dc talk- go away!!!,"That's just about all I have to say. This is standard, which is a nasty word in music. Everything about this cd is typically christian. If you want revolutionary, turn and run!"
5,Excellent!,"I hope the roumors of their breakup are false. Lookout boy-toy groups, here comes someone with real talent!"
5,AWESOME!,"I really enjoyed this CD. I didn't think it was as good as Jesus Freak, but it still deserves 5 stars. I have been listening to DC Talk ever since they stepped onto the music scene. I have seen them evolve from their original total rap form to their now matured mixed form. I like the in this CD how they bring all their forms together to make a great CD. I especially liked the songs My Friend(So Long), and Since I met You. I extremely encourage this CD to anyone either Christian or non-christian."
5,hello,I think dc talk is pretty cool and their music is very good. Their songs are different I think that's useful for a album that you can listen day after day.
5,Amazon reviewer.,"Hello? Michael is the one who sounds like Seal, he has the lead in Consume Me and Wanna Be Loved. Michael sounds great, but it's Kevin who is the best! dc Talk is virtualy the only band I listen to! They aren't a rock band, a pop band, a classical group or a punk band, they are dc Talk."
5,Don't settle for intermission...,"I can not belive I didn't get this cd sooner.Great sound, Great lyriks(sorry if i misspelled that),Makes you wonder why they split up.As for the title, Greatest hits has only 2 songs from this cd!As far as I'm conserned, they should have put ""Jesus Freak"" and ""In the light"" on this album and called it Greatest Hits!!!......all the songs an this cd are REALLY GOOD, but here are my favoritesIt's killing meDiveMy friend (so long)Wanna Be LovedSince I Met You (OH YEAH!!! My favorite on the cd.)Into JesusRed Lettersok. If you get this cd, it just might be the smartest thing you ever did.Go DC TALK!!!"
3,Harry Potter Journal,"The book was in faif condition. However, it was very clear that pages had been torn out and not done very well."
2,"Hey! If it's your sort of thing, go for it!","This would be great for someone who uses a journal or would like to, but for someone who is just a fan of Harry Potter, they may find it dissappointing to have a blank book on their shelf. It's a pretty indulgent thing to buy if you aren't going to put it to good use. So write in it!"
2,A Coffee Table Book,"This book had some nice photos and did include a bit of information on the wrecks and dive sites, but is definitely not a book for a serious wreck diver. For example, no information is given on the locations of the wrecks so anyone interested in seeing the wrecks is forced to find a local dive operation. Since most local dive trips cater to casual, recreational divers who normally follow the recommendations of the operator and have little input on the destination anyway one wonders about the usefulness or potential audience for this book."
5,Funny guy,"Darren is a very funny guy, and provides great family entertainment. If you are looking for some stand-up that you can share with your family, this will fill the bill!"
5,Very clean and very funny,His stand-up comedy is true-blue funny. Worth every penny. I hope he comes up with some new DVDs
2,too complicated,"This necklace actually uses a lot of materials, but it is way too much for someone as petite as I am. It occupied too much area and it looked cheap."
3,Shadow Lake,"Pretty good for a B movie, if you like Graham Greene. Passable mystery, develops well but a bit stale in spots."
2,A real disappointment,"Graham Greene is one of my favorite actors, but even he couldn't save this. It was a tv special sort-of movie, and was utterly predictable. Mr Greene's acting is, as always, an insperation, as is the mechanism for solving the mystery. Unfortunately, neither of these make the movie ultimately work."
3,Interesting,"A reasonable read but not compelling, a bit slow to develop and the story was pedestrian at times. Didn't live up to the reviews online at point of sale."
4,I love this book,"I picked up this book for about 2 bucks at a used book store. I loved it from the first couple of paragraphs, it always kept my attention."
4,Stayed up until 3 in the morning to finish it,"Although this book is a story about the drug trade and the trade's evolution from ""innocence"" to violent, big business, it is more about the protagonist's comittment to honor. The point of view keeps this from being a ""private eye"" story, and the character development makes you become really interested in the outcomes of the characters.Some of the scenes portrayed in the book are very violent, and it is not for younger readers"
1,Disappointed,"This is the first review that I have been motivated to write about any novel.I bought this book based on the reviews posted and I am mystfied how so many people see greatness in this work.The premise is week ,unrealistic and overly violent.I almost gave up on this book several times but continued reading hoping for the story to improve,but it did not.This is the worst novel I have read in many years and a cure for insomnia.If I could give it less than 1 star I would."
3,"Repeat,repeat,repeat.","Story began with much promise. However,it did not carry on the promise. Too much beating around the Bush resulted in the temptation to flip thru pages . Need to get to the point. Characters became confusing, poorly developed. I will be gracious and say read and judge for yourself if you are bored"
2,"to expensive, didn't stick","The idea behind this pillows development was wonderful, but after only three weeks the suction cups died and stopped sticking to the tub normally. Then they just started sticking onto to the bathtub so strongly that we couldn't pull them off the porcelain. They'd just pop out of the `sockets' that we had cups with no pillow stuck to the tub for a few days. This pillow had great possibilities and was more expensive then other similar products. If I could choose again I'd stick with this company's `Bean Pillow'. It is hard to be negative, but with a little work this might be a great spa pillow. But it isn't there yet."
4,waterproof pillow,The pillow used in our bath is just what the doctor ordered..It is large enough and provides a luxorious feeling for the time you are in the bath. It is what it says it is
2,Read for a class,"I did not like this book. Russ is angry and the book is angry. I read for enjoyment not for politics or onesided emotions. There is no balance here. As I understand it,Russ, a recognized and celebrated heroine of the feminist movement, wrote this book as her last fiction novel platform for feminism then went on to write non-fiction books on the subject. (per research on her for class) This book is highly political, anti-muslim, and very angry. The story has potential but not presented this way for me. Some enjoy this style and enjoy the book."
4,Model T Rock Tumbler- a Good Start,"This unit takes about 3 lbs of rock which means you can pick and choose your rocks carefully. the larger units you have to fill and sometimes it's hard getting the right amount of rocks with the right hardness. It's probably ideal to have at least two tumblers going at the same time so you have more flexibility. That being said, the tumbler is working exactly as anticipated and our first batch produced some truly beautiful specimens. I was surprised though how much the rocks shrink after polishing losing at least 1/3 their size, plus the big ones may do a number on the smaller ones- some of the agates seemed to disappear. I would choose as close to exactly the same size and hardness in the future. In the meantime the little tumbler keeps on tumbling along, not quiet but not too terribly loud either. Next stop- the local hobby shop for more polishing materials- just enough for one batch provided with this unit."
5,A Good Product,I purchased this for my grand daughter who had begun collecting stones from places she has visited. Now she is polishing some of them with very satisfying results
4,Interesting but noisy,"I bought this for my nephew as an entry level rock tumbler. It worked well but was noisy enough to have to be banished to the garage when on. He has now graduated to a better one, but this is a great starter."
5,Great tumbler,"This tumbler is simplistic and effective. It holds about as many rocks as a pickle jar (but you shouldn't over-load it). It takes about 4 weeks (1 week per stage) to polish the rocks, as the grit gets finer and finer until they get a nice shine. My kids had fun with it, and now can collect rocks, excited to see what they will become."
3,go for the higher end unit,concerns over the lid popping open and spilling the contents. go for the higher end unit with the bolt on lid.
2,How to See and Hear Rare Footage,Usually there is a choice of watching the DVD with commentary or without. I thought this would be so but the only way to watch ABBA perform on these DVD's was with the reviewers talking above the footage and the singing. A great disappointment. As an ABBA fan I would like to see and hear their early live performances.
5,ABBA Ultimate review 3 dvds,I love it and enjoy it. I recommend for ALL true ABBA fans. This is three dvds that are usually sold seperately. Just buy this one and you save yourself a lot of money. They are done by ABBA and they are in them all.
5,One of the Best,"Another great effort by Dotsero! If you ever get the chance, go hear these guys - they're fabulous. My favorites on this one are Portrait of Amy, A Thistle and Gold (whenever I hear it, I think of riding through the beautiful Rockies on a train) and Amazing Grace (simply beautiful). I highly recommend this CD as well as their latest - West of Westchester."
5,The best Cocoa book is a NeXTStep book.,"So obj-c is c with some extensions.....Maybe it is, but after opening most of the Cocoa books on the marked, a lot of people find Cocoa to be quite a distance from c.Mostly because c-code is easy and (for a newcomer) not very abstract in a geeky way. In this book, every c-coder will be familiar with the syntax. There is even sample code which doesn't use IB. And the code is highly readable.This book is very well written and the applications that is included is downright cool.A calculator , mathematica very light, a graph app that outputs mathematic functions (sine, cos..)I have heard that Simson is coming out with a new book this spring. Here is one buyer.NextStep Programming will bring you far."
3,chair cover too small,the cover needs to be larger and it was hard to fit on the chair. the color is true to the picture.
4,Best looking & fitting for me...,"Got three different ones (at the same time), to try and compare (all SureFit brand).For my Target - Brown Martin Track Arm Club Chair (they have other similar models),this was the best color, fabric and fit, hands down.I think its related to the ties you have on the front and both sides (that wrap to the back) that made it fit as perfect as can be.The 4 stars are because its not a perfect fit (there might not be one)."
4,Extremely comprehensive book,"This is an excellent book. It is extremely comprehensive and will give you all the written details. I only wish it would have had actual photographs to compare what you encounter against. They may have avoided this on purpose since there can be so many variations for any given bug, but I still like to compare photos against what I've seen. But on the whole - great, unbelievably comprehensive book."
3,Mayflies: a review,"A reasonable addition to one's library;it is now somewhat dated. Its strengths are descriptive across many of the species and fairly complete color descriptions of the varying stages; its glaring weakness is impaired and absent color photography of the stages and especially of imitative fly patterns. One can obviously cross reference with other sources and catalogues to cover the weaknesses,but for a reference of this specificity,I feel these should be included in the textual material.The authors writing style is a bit unenthusiastic,but the tables and organization is acceptable. Overall,I was a bit disappointed."
4,ground breaking,"Completely thorough ceramic analysis of the Haiti region, and the first time the term ""mode"" and ""modal analysis"" was introduced into the archaeological literature. He describes step by step, how he built and why, his ceramic typology. If only everybody wrote as he did. Excellent piece of work!"
4,Heartbreaking,"Most of the movies I tend to watch have messed up stories with people that have complicated depressing lives. This is just that, it has a lot of very hard to watch scenes but the movie did get it's point across. I did enjoy this mostly for Joseph and Michelle Trachtenberg being casted. It's worth watching."
1,not exactly escapist fare,"watched the film because it had same actor from rian johnson's brick.brick is a mind bending amazing flick of what it means to be heroic.this is simply a film of victims becoming victimizers in an endless descent into misery and hell.sad, depressing, hard to watch and .... i gotta get my mind of this.too disturbing........"
3,"Well written, but ... why was I reading this again?","Rules of Conflict is a well-written book in a fairly interesting sci-fi world. There's intrigue and mystery and, to its credit, this is the first book I've read where 'paper-pushers' are the heros/heroines ... wait a minute, is that a good thing?To the cynic, one would say the the aliens in this novel are all afflicted by a severe obsessive-compulsive eating disorder, the heroine, Jani, spends much of her time afflicted by paranoia and the aforementioned eating disorder, and Jani's past/future/present lovers spend all of their time either trying to use, save or ruin her.All-in-all, it was an interesting ride, but I'm not sure I got the point of it ... unless this was merely a bridge to the last book of the a trilogy."
5,Two excellent books in this series,I have thoroughly enjoyed both books that Kristine Smith has produced and am waiting with some anticipation for the third which is due later this year. For a new writer she has produced a heroine that you want to know more about in a universe that appears more interesting the more you read. She has managed to evade the trap of many new authors of feeling that everything has to be completely explained all in one hit and one is left wanting more. Jane Kilian our heroine has finally been returned to face trial but things are not going to happen the way everyone expects. Get the books. Read them both. I guarantee you will enjoy them.
3,Not Quite Up To It,"Kristine Smith's follow up to Code of Conduct doesn't satisfy. She is a good writer, creates interesting characters, and sets them in a believable future world. But then she wanders around, like her heroine, incapacitated by strange afflictions that confuse memories, reality, and hallucinations. Badly needed a rigorous editor who wouldn't have let her get away with it."
4,Good first release,"The Occasion's self-titled is pretty good somber music. It's really sad day music, but that's okay. I've heard better, but the Occasion does an exceptional job. One of my only qualms was the exit of the final track, Annika. It broke the rhythm of the whole CD, but that's okay. If you can tolerate that, I would seriously recommend picking this up."
4,Great kite for bargain price,Got this kite promptly and was greatly surprised. Thought kite was low-priced because described as all black which is a little dull for a summer kite experience. Was willing to live with in light of the price but was surprised that kite actually has colorful panels to it. Makes this kite a hidden bargain. Glad I took chance on it. Looks good and can not wait to put it in the sky.
4,"Smooth and Fine sounding ""Flats""","I havea set of these on my Michael Kelly acoustic bass guitar - these made the instrument playable and fun to use! BUT, I should have ordered the SL (super long) version for my 35"" scale Peavey Grind 5 string, instead of these - they are too short, so, now I am trying to sell this new set (opened but unused.....). My bad...... But, these are EXCELLENT strings for feel, zeroing out fret and string noise, and GREAT warm, mellow, accurate sound!"
4,A little disappointed.,I bought these strings with plans of putting them on my Schecter Hellraiser-5. These strings were in no way long enough to fit.I just put them another bass.
4,A little short for my bass,"I love the tone of these strings--none of the string noise while sliding up and down into different finger positions.My only gripe is that the strings are about an inch too short for stringing through the body of my Ibanez SR-905 bass. Stringing through the end of the bridge leaves some of the threads covering the bottom of the string crossing the bridge which makes tuning difficult. They are also a bit light for my taste, but they do fairly well."
1,BORING & DULL,"This book breaks up into 13 chapters.All about true stories and poems written by girls.Some of the chapters include riot Grrls,Teen mothers,Farm Chicks etc.The girls write about therelifes and experiences.Yet the writing is sometimes bad.It wasa disappiontment for me."
5,"Brilliantly Compiled,moving and heartwarming stories",I bought this book to learn more about a certain group of girls (riotgirls). What I got was so much more. This book blew me away. The writings and experiences these girls share is so moving and heartfelt. I am a big fan of Hillary Carlip for having uindertaken this huge effort. I am a big fan of the girls for having written from their hearts and truth.
2,Sleeper!,The book lumps young women into several categories. A few girls expressions about life are inserted into each section. I think that the book is very simplistic and boring.
4,A great book for ALL types of teenage girls,Girl Power gives girls a chance to hear what girls of all types are thinking. It gives you more self confidence knowing that other girls go through the same problems as yourself.
3,"parts are good, parts are not.","The works of the young women are excellent, and Ms. Carlip should be commended for including such groups as sorority girls and beauty queens is the book, but I think it could have been helpful for her to include more on the currently relevant topics, such as teen mothers, lesbian and bisexual girls, and even rappers and skaters. These sections are good, but too short. I believe that there are more female skaters and rappers who have trouble with low self esteem and being accepted for who they are than girls in sororities. It is an overall decent book though, and get it if you'd like to read sometimes disturbing, most often just truthful accounts of what it's like to be Native American or a surfer."
4,Good Book For Girls To Read,"This book would be really good for all teenage girls to read. Some sections are more interesting than others, but the whole book adresses things that need to be said and people that need to be understood. The book features un-edited versions of what the girls wrote, so there are many spelling and grammer mistakes; as well as language that some parents may object to. However, I think teenage girls should be required to read this book. Some of the attitudes in this book are a little out of date; but the messages remain the same."
4,Beautiful,This bedding is beautiful and the price was right. A bit much polyester for my taste but I basically just bought it for decoration. Very lovely!
1,Arid,"You'll love this book if you're interested in fairly dull essays written by people most of whom you have no knowledge or care. After reading about halfway through, I tossed it into the ""pass along"" stack. That said, the book does have some very interesting and memorable essays concerning the British attack on New York City at the beginning of the American Revolution. But if you're hoping for a colorful essay-type history of New York City as I was, purchase another. This is more of a collection of writings by people who happened to have lived in or around New Your City."
4,read it if you enjoyed high school algebra,"If you, like me, loved high-school algebra and wished you had gotten more of it, then this is the book for you. It is what would have been taught in high-school algebra 4, if such a course existed. You will learn about continued fractions, the relationship between continued fractions and quadratic equations, and the fascinating properties of reduced quadratic irrationals; and you will feel like an algebraic whiz as you learn to use continued fractions to solve classes of equations (diophantine and Pell's) that you never knew how to solve before. My only complaint about the book is that a few of the results that are proved algebraically have much simpler and totally obvious geometric proofs. I received this book as a prize in 1977, just got around to reading it now, and I'm glad I did!"
2,mixed too fast,The original album is at the correct speed. Somehow thiswas remastered at a faster tempo and it makes some of thesongs sound soooooo wrong. Wish they would remaster thisgem. Go find the lp.
4,improved audio.,"a vast improvement over the Epic records early 90's release.""Situation"" sound so much better.wish it was cheaper.lets see some more Jeff Beck Group reissues."
3,"Old ""Skool"" KUng Fu!!",",,I do agree with the previous 3 reviewer,,,this flick is a water-down, monday night quarterback, and pre-modonna version of the 18 brondsmen,,,,a poor idea of a sequal. However, don't get me wrong,,,this flick is still a great watch,,,,as it's well choreographed and beautifully put together. The fight scenes are simply amazing,a very tight plot,,,truly an entertaining and brilliant performance by Cater Wong!!"
5,"Great, soulful, funky contemporary jazz!","This is an amazing smooth jazz album. The previous reviewer is obviously not real bright because it isn't even supposed to be ""synth pop"". This is a jazz album, and a VERY good one at that. Highly recommended!"
3,Could be a little better,"This is a fair product, The only thing I found was wrong with it is, the squeeze bulb. Its just too flimsy, meaning that once it has a very little bit of vacuum behind it the bulb wont expant to allow for another pump. I believe that a man needs between 8 and 10 pumps to create a suffent vacuum arount his penis to pull the blood into the shaft and head which in turn expands the blood-vessels making it bigger. I could only get 4 to 5 pumps before the bulb would stay collapsed not allowing any further pumping. I hope this review helps anyone looking at this product it the future."
1,garbage,"i received my product last week, the shipping was great ,because i got the product on time. as for the product its waste of money, the pic on the box , is way different than what's in the box. it shows a steel valve, i got a plastic valve. as for the pump, it pumps only 3 for me , and than that's it .there's no suction whats so everthis is a piece of #$%%%%%waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,For the price it get's a good review....,Otherwise it's just a cheap pump...what else do you expect? My bf uses it with his other pieces off other pumps...good size cylinder :)
2,Not a Happily-Ever-After romance,"I don't like to post spoilers in my reviews, so it's hard to say much, but I really didn't like the way this book ended. It was NOT a HEA. Harlequin, what were you thinking?"
2,Average movie,"I bought this because my boy and I have been reading the call of the wild, but this movie has a lot langauge in it. So not that great"
5,Million Dollar Kick,"The Million Dollar Kick is a great book. It is so suspenseful. You never know what she is going to do. The main character hates being the star but her sister loves it. My mom, my six year old sister and I all liked it. It is such a good book."
5,The Million Dollar Kick,"Thirteen- year- old Whisper, who hated sports, was confused when she found out she had a chance to win a million dollars by kicking a goal.The thing I liked about this book is that she gets a chance to win a million dollars. The book was very interesting. It is interesting because it's a lot about sports and I love sports. I think all kids would like this book. If I were to rate this book 1-5 I would give it a five."
2,sketchy,"After reading the entire book, it was not entirely clear to me whether she had an innovative new approach, or whether she needed to come to a better self-understanding. Specifically, she seemed to be very proud of feeling comfortable wearing sexy clothes to session, and viewed clients wearing sexy clothes as progress. I just don't know what to make of it."
2,Deepening Intimacy in Psychotherapy : Using the Erotic Transference and Countertransference,The author is an exhibitionist who is unaware of how she sexualizes her relationships with patients to enact a reversal of her experiencies with an abandoning father and rejecting mother.
2,"Healthy Parents, Better Babies","I was actually very disappointed with this book. I didn't realize that there would be such an Australian slant and that they would not give me in depth information about common US preconception practices, like updating immunizations. I didn't find the nutrition information detailed enough. Also, I thought the book was *way* crunchy (and I'm pretty crunchy myself)... I just don't think that following their recommendations about herbs etc. would be practical for my life. It just wasn't a good fit."
5,It gave me NEW hope and NEW answers - thanks,"After two miscarriages my husband and I were looking for answers . I was recommended the book and read it. The pre-conception programme really made sense. We went to see Francesca Naish and got on the programme - we followed it for 6 months, and we both felt the healthiest we had ever been. I took a range of vitamins, minerals, and my husband did most of the time! After 6 months we started trying and I fell pregnant the first time. We now have a very health and happy baby boy. I can only credit the programme with this result and am grateful that this book was around when we started searching for answers. I know that it has helped thousands of couples in Australia, and I hope it will help many more in the US. It is a natural way to solving many problems, and it is not expensive."
2,The book made me scared to concieve!,"This book was horrible. I think other people have said it but after I read it I was scared to conceive. The way the information was presented it pretty much read, ""If you don't follow this book you will have a horrible pregnancy and a screwed up child"" NO JOKE! Some information seemed helpful, but it seriously was full of scary senerios that made me scared to get pregnant! If you're looking for a good preconcetion book, this isnt it! (Try Before Your Pregnany, a 90-Day guide for couples on how to prepare for a healthy conception... <-- this is an amazing book!)"
2,Autoswitch not working after ~ 2years on the job,"This used to be a fairly trustworthy product, but about 2 years after I purchased it, its now useless. the autoswitching feature does not work, even when I set it to maximum sensitivity. The pieces that are plugged into the 'automatically switched outlets' never turn on.Even before this, the unit was a little flaky - now it's completely shot."
1,Great Idea / Didn't Really Work,"I wound up buying three of these to help manage phantom load. In the end, I was only able to use one on my home theater system. The other two attempts to use with computer equipment did not work out since the computer did not draw enough power when it came out sleep mode to trigger the autoswitch on the control outlet. Same problem when using with laptop or cell phone chargers. In the end even the home theater setup was mostly bust since the DirecTV box acted badly and needed a 5 minute reset if you cut the power to it. Until they make a more sensitive model it is probably best to avoid with these."
2,How much costs is the power strip consumption?,"None of the fabricants mention the consumption of those master-slave power strips in their online technical specs. This information is relevant to consumers and when not displayed clearly and transparently leads to mistaken decisions by consumers. As far as I checked with many customers about several kinds of master-slave power strips, they need from 9W to 15W to work. You need to calculate this 9W to 15W additional consumption 365 days per year from the master-slave power strip, deduct the energy you will spare from other equipments you have plugged in it (calculate their consumption in stand-by mode) and check if at the end of the day you will spare or not energy by purchasing the master-slave power strip. In some cases, you will consume more energy using the power strip than letting your home appliances in stand-by."
4,smart strips save u $$$,"smart strips are a great way to cut down on your light bills, especially in and around your tv, theatre, and audio equipment."
4,Oprah's Choice,I saw this advertised by Oprah on her show and thought it would be a good way to help the energy bill and our environment. This is a great buy!
1,Just waste of money,"I bought two of these items. It does not work at all. Not even as a simple multiplug. I called the manufacturer and was never able to reach them. I would suggest, never ever buy this item."
4,This absolutely works!,"I have two of these in my house. One of them is for my desktop PC and peripherals in the office and the other is in the living room with the HDTV, games, and blu ray. Setting them up was a cinch. I simply had to dial in the correct adjustment on the little knob and everything worked as expected. Over time I have had to adjust each of them slightly, but that's no biggie.I have been using them for about a year and am currently using them in a mid sized house. Since starting use I have seen my energy bills plummet a minimum of 20% and recently nearly 80%. All of my other electricity habits have stayed the same and I'm still saving a ton of money. My most recent bill for electricity was $12...in a 1400 sq ft house!!! That's for a month not including a/c.Smart strips are awesome and I recommend them to everyone I come by."
2,Worked fine for a few months...,It worked fine for the first few months with my iMac. But now it can't tell when to turn off or on the switched outlets. My speakers click on and off all night when my computer goes to sleep. I guess I will be looking for another solution.
2,Defective,"Product was defective. My TV was unable to control the autoswitched outlets or other devices. My lamp was able to control only the indicator light for the autoswitched outlets, but apparently not the outlets themselves as my TV and XBox were not being turned back on. It took their customer service about 4 days to return my call even though the receptionist initially advised me that they would be in touch ""shortly"". I give them 1 star for bad quality control and poor customer service, plus 1 star for the possibility that a replacement item would have worked."
3,Smart strip,"I recently bought three of these and have had some issues with them. I have a router attached to my desktop computer that allows the laptops in the house to be used. With the smart strip, I must turn on the desktop in order for any of the others to be usuable. Same thing with my living room, where I have the tv, wii and stereo all plugged in. The stereo will not turn on until I turn the tv on. I might be setting things up wrong...need to read the directions again."
1,smart strip,Not as promised would not recommend wish I could send it back for a refund does not save a dime
2,Worked for 4 years and then loud buzzing sound and blown my speaker fuse,"Loved this product for 4 years until it suddenly started buzzing (really loud!) and it also blows the fuse of my speakers too. I thought power strips lasts forever. Had to switch back to a regular power surge strip -- painful to turn off my PC, speakers, monitors one by one but had this older strip for much longer than the SCG3. It was also cheaper too."
2,Worked great... for less than a year.,"I purchased this item in 2009 and it worked great, for about a year. After that, it turned into a regular power strip, regardless of unplugging it, using the adjustment switch, etc. I threw it away and bought a replacement, which also lasted about a year before having the SAME problem.When I spend this much money for a surge protector, I expect it to work longer than 1 year."
5,Works so well I bought 2 more!,I own two of the 7 plug smart strips after buying and loving the 10 plug model for my home entertainment cord mess :) I couldn't recommend this more to anyone who wants to be energy-conscious but lives with other people who have trouble remembering to turn things off. I'm sure my roommate appreciates me not bugging him to unplug his power-guzzling transformer for his pc speakers!
2,"After 3 Years of Service, It Started Buzzing and Refused to Work","Also broke my Sony receiver that was plugged in. When in buzzing mode (sounded like elitrical arcing), the receiver would flicker every time we shut our Xbox off (the control outlet) for the last month. No adjustment of the power sensitivity would fix it. Great product...till it fries your gear."
2,Finicky,"The strip worked with two of my electrical set-ups and did not work with two others. It didn't like my laptop as the main device or my Energy Star TV. For the laptop, I did followed the adjustment instructions and it seemed to be working fine, but then just stopped working properly. I move the strip to a set-up with our flat screen TV and it worked fine. For the Energy Star TV, when I adjusted it so it would turn everything off, I couldn't turn my TV back on again. Only worth the money if you love hours trouble shooting. I'm going back to using a regular power strip and just turning it off myself when I'm not using it."
3,Disappointed,"Does not work with Sony STR-DH510 rcv'r/amp as controlling device. Had to use my Sony TV as control, which in my setup is less than ideal, but I'll live with it."
4,Gets those who wouldn't participate in energy reduction to participate w/the push of a button!,"I wasn't too sure about this when I bought it online but after fiddling with it at home it has been a breeze to use. Also, the rest of my family who normally wouldn't participate in this type of energy savings now participates just by shutting off the tv at night!I would repurchase again."
4,Partial succes,"I purchased 2 Power Strip devices. One is used with my Sony desktop computer to shut down the monitor and powered subwoofer. This works perfectly after some adjustment. The other power strip is used for my TV to shut down my DVD, VCR and Wii when not used. This does not consistently shut down or start-up the devices properly. I'm still adjusting and it either shuts down and won't restart or vice versa."
4,It works!,It really does what it says - without tweaking. I wish the plugs were a little further apart so you could add more transformer units.
4,Great Idea,It is a bit expensive but we love the idea. We plugged in our TV and all the accessories. So the accessories only come on when we turn the TV on... they eventually go off a bit after you turn the TV off. Our clock plugs into the same strip and is always on.
3,NOT ALL IT'S ADVERTISED TO BE,"It's just the right size for my needs. But, I'm about six or seven uses down the road with it and things have started to stick."
5,oval roasting rack,just what I needed. I only had to bend the sides a little to fit the pan I bought it for.
3,Okay I Guess,"I've really enjoyed a lot of British programing especially series like Inspector Morse, Ms Marpole, Poirot and Midsomer Murders and so I thought I'd check out this series. It was okay I guess but I wouldn't purchase another set. Perhaps these characters grow on you but I'm not a real fan of the one hour programs not enough time for character and plot development"
5,getting fed up,"As always, the Pie In The Sky series was excellent. But I have a complaint and it is not just with this set. So many times I have received DVDs which stall or become pixelated. Within 13 minutes of the first episode, the DVD stalled. I could not fast forward, stop it, or even shut off the machine. It was locked in place. The only remedy was to unplug the DVD player and then speed through the stalled section of the DVD so it would play. I have placed these DVD's in one of my other 9 DVD players and two computers and the problem occurs again. So, the problem is not with my player. These producers should be more concerned with quality control."
1,If you are looking for authentic Atlandtic Starr DONT BUY THIS CD,"From the moment I popped it in the cd player, i knew i had made a mistake. the voices are not the same at all. I looked the cover over completely trying to make sure i didn't buy a cd that was Atlantic Starr songs but re recorded by other people. It sounds like [...]not at all what i was looking for"
2,DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE Atlantic Starr but this CD is all of their old songs that they went back into the studio and re-recorded - they shouldn't have bothered!! When I purchased the CD I was happy because it had some of their older songs plus newer onese like ""Masterpiece"" I've only listened to it once and won't do it again - buy their ""Best of Atlantic Starr its a little more expensive, but you won't be disappointed."
2,Masterpiece,"I just purchased Atlantic Starr's Greatest Hits. However, it doesn't sound at all like the Atlantic Starr I've heard years ago. I also have one of their cassettes, which by the way is Atlantic Starr. If you like the songs, then you'll be happy with this cd; however, if you're looking to hear Atlantic Starr, better buy something else! I agree with the other reviews. If I had known that this wasn't Atlantic Starr, I wouldn't have bought it. Besides, after paying for 2nd day, I rec'd this, along with another cd, in about one week!"
1,Re-recorded!,"I can't emphasize more what other reviewers have written. This album consists of re-recorded material. There is nothing more disappointing than buying an album, thinking the songs you grew up listening to are on there, only to find out that they have been re-recorded. Take my advice and stay away from this one!"
5,great if you love the non-hollywood kind of movie,"This movie isn't for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves good intelligent but irreverant humor. Brooks' character (himself) is so vein you have to love him. And Charles Grodin, one of Hollywood's most underrated actors, is funnier than I have ever seen him."
3,Okay.,"Perhaps I just got a bad tape, but the color quality of the film seemed to be lacking, sort of like a washed out old home movie. There are some funny parts, but there are some slow parts, which is probably why I didn't bother seeing the rest of the film. It is nowhere near as funny or as slick as Brooks' Lost in America, which has to reign as the funniest movie ever made."
3,Prophetic,"Long before ""Survivor"" or ""MTV Real World"" came this reality show comedy. Even then, characters used the camera to act out grudges and fantasies. One attempts an alliance with the producer, another tries to make a fast buck, and there seems no resistance to manufacturing a ""fake"" ending. It's also likely the first time outside of ""Popular Mechanics"" magazine to envision digital video. It's more often amusing than laugh out loud funny."
4,Don't miss the Trailer,This has got to be Albert Brooks near his best. A real funny movie. Make sure to get the DVD version of this with the extra interview with brooks (circa 2001)and don't forget to watch the trailer for this movie also on the DVD. It is hysterically funny and as good as any scene of the movie.
1,Misleading listing... this is NOT a color scanner,"The name is GMP COLOR CARD SCANNER-NIMCARD ( THK-NIMP ), yet what ships is a b&w;/monochrome scanner. This would appear to be intentionally misleading. When it is a b&w; device, what exactly is the ""color"" part?It's too bad, too, because once you get through the rather-odd registration process to get it to work, it is pretty simple to use. But again, when it says ""COLOR"" in the name, it ought to be more than b&w;/monochrome."
5,The wait is over!,"I saw this made for tv movie years and years ago. It is typical of your made for tv movie in quality of production and storyline and script. Of course it is a bit cheesy, but I found it amusing and wonderful for what it was. I was disappointed that it never aired on tv much since its original release but I was very delighted that it came out on dvd! If you have seen this before then you understand my love for it! But if you haven't don't expect too much, because it is after all just a made for tv movie."
4,not actually that bad,"I'll be honest, I did not want to see this film, but due to the two on the cover I watched it against my own will and right off the bat it grabbed my attention. The film was aired on ABC Family so you wont see any sex, nudity, foul language etc. Nice little film, not many ""lol"" moments but several ""laugh on inside"" moments. Id give it a chance."
4,Seriously...,"Let's face it...unless Megan Fox had made it big with ""Transformers"", and Kaley Cuoco with ""The Big Bang Theory"", this movie would have never made the light of day.Surprisingly, I am glad it did. I sure wasn't expecting much. After all, this movie was made in 2004...long before either ""Transformers"", or ""Big Bang.""The truth is, while the movie is neither memorable, nor will it likely be on your Top Ten List of Movies, it is rather fun and pleasurable. Fans of ""Penny"" in Big Bang will likely find her performance fun, and fans of Megan Fox will enjoy the pleasure of seeing her before she became famous.Not a great movie, but it's better than I expected. Really good fun!"
4,It's better than I thought it would be,"I thought this movie was going to be bad, but it wasn't. Two hot chicks and a great storyline. The acting is pretty good, the movie is a low budget movie so the quality of the movie isn't that great. This movie was supposed to be a TV movie and that's why it's not your usual better quality movies. Even though this movie is about the mob, there actually no sex, language, violence or anything bad about it. This is just a clean funny comedy. Get it cheap and you'll like it."
4,Fashion with Passion,Story nearly predictable but fun. The underdog issue who climbs to success always welcome these days. Actress Kaley Cuoco refreshingly funny. Great entertainment for those rainy days.
5,enjoy kaley cuoco comedy,"MOVIE MADE FOR ABC FAMILY THAT DISPLAYS THE COMEDIC TALENT OF BIG BANGS KALEY CUOCO. THIS YOUNG LADY HAS GREAT COMEDY TIMING AND IS A NATURAL TALENT THAT HAS DONE BOTH COMEDY AND DRAMA. DONT EXPECT GREAT DRAMA IN THIS FILM AND JUST SIT BACK, RELAX AND GET READY TO SMILE."
5,It's A Good One!,"This product is great. Really works! After two weeks i honestly felt a difference. Keep it up, be faithful and have a healthy diet and you'll see results in no time!"
4,"Good Information, Full of tips and strategies.","I got this book for part II of the reading courses I need to satisfy State Department of Education requirements for teacher certification (secondary level). I like this book, it's easy to read and it has many different strategies to support students' reading comprehension in any content area. I especially like the fact that it has a matrix with helpful examples for almost every subject. I will definitively keep this text for future reference."
5,Quilting Design Sourcebook,"This is a wonderful book of quilting designs. I especially appreciate the historical information, and also the suggestions for variations on each pattern. This book really brought a new dimension to my quilting. Highly recommended!"
3,Not bad...not bad at all,"Okay, it's fairly bad, but a very decent movie for the genre at the time. Amy Steel as the heroine, Ginny, gives a pretty good performance, and the cinematography is superb for a slasher movie. Some criticize it as being a copy of the first movie, but it simply uses the first as a base for expansion and does pretty well for itself. Definitely worth a look! END"
5,JASON VOORHEESE IS EXCELLENT!,"JASON'S THE MAN,AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE!OUT OF ALL THE SERIAL KILLERS FROM THE PAST AND UP TIL TODAY-JASON'S THE BEST!HE'S THE NUMBER 1 SERIAL KILLER OF ALL TIMES!THIS IS ANOTHER EXCELLENT MOVIE!JASON KILLS WITH STYLE AND CLASS.THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT JASON-YOU JUST HAVE TO LIKE HIM!THIS MOVIE'S SUSPENSFUL,SCARY,AND INTERESTING.YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT JASON WILL DO NEXT.I BOUGHT THE WHOLE SERIES. I'M GLAD I DID."
3,"ENTER JASON, BUT WITHOUT HIS TRADEMARK HOCKEY MASK!","I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.The second installment of the series is the first to feature Jason as the killer, but without the trademark hockey mask that would later mark every other Friday film. The film isn't all that much different from the first and that is why I give it only a 2 1/2 star rating. Jason hasn't peaked at this point, but he would soon do so!The DVD transfer is good and the box set has some cool extra material."
4,Friday the 13th Part 2 is the best in the series!,"Where are the lost cut scenes? What a bummer. Maybe they are truly lost.Anyway, this 2nd installment in the series is by far the best Friday film. Jason looks the creepiest in this one and the chase scenes are the best. This is the most frightening, least cheesy Friday movie. The best of them all!"
3,a good sequel,"Friday the 13th part 2 was as good as the first. In fact, I kind of liked Part 2 a little better because it had more people in it and of course the killer is (you know who). Part 2 explains everything that happened in the first movie. I guess in a way you could skip the first movie because Part 2 lets the viewer know what went on at Camp Crystal Lake or ""Camp Blood"" as they say. However, as I mentioned in my review of the first movie...the killer is probably the main reason why the original Friday the 13th is a classic. Some people may not like the fact that the heroine from the first movie gets killed in the beginning of Part 2. Yes, I didn't care too much for that either but trust me...it doesn't spoil the movie."
3,The very first Jason movie!,"After his mom bought it in the first film, childhood drown victim, Jason Vorhees returns from his watery grave for the first time (but certainly not the last) to exact revenge on any horny teenager dumb enough to visit Camp Crystal Lake.If you're not a fan of the slasher genre or of horror movies in general then there probably isn't any reason to watch this one but it does make for good, cheesy fun."
3,three stars,"More crazy then mrs pamela voorhees. Jason rises from the dead in this chapter, to pick up were mommy left off. Alice from part one doesnt survive jason wrath and after five years of silence, jason was still convinced his mom would come back. Part two is good, but not like part one."
2,"Not the Best, But FAR From the Worst.","Well, this does not quite match the first. In this chapter, we lose the element of plausibility that the first one had. Also, I think the death of King in the first scene kills the suspense of the movie. I think it would have been much more effective to see strange things happening, have Geena discuss the situation, and then have her exposed to the truthful reality of what she feared. On the positive side, some images are well done. The characters are pretty well developed, and there are some nice comical moments. Jeff and Sandra make a real likable couple, and it is touching when Vikki falls in love with the handicapped Mark. Also, the story is well constructed in that Part 2 opens up 5 years after Part 1, at a nearby camp, and where fears of the past have not exactly vanished."
3,The Body Count Continues....,"After the head over heels ending to ""Friday the 13th"", Jason Voorhees rises up from his grave to seek revenge, for the beheading of his mother, in ""Friday the 13th Part 2"". This second film is much like the first, a jump out of your seat scarefest. The sack that Jason wears over his head thru out the film is inspired by the 70's movie - ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" (the film, based on a true incident in Texarcana, Arkansas, had a hooded serial killer running amok in a small town). Ever wonder what happened to the cast of any of the ""Friday"" films? You're probablly thinking that these films are usually career poison (like I did), but you would be wrong. Amy Steel, the heroine of ""Friday 2"", is still acting & doing the occasional guest role."
1,POOR SEQUEL TO THE FIRST,"This is one of the weakest in the series especially the first 10 minutes of the movie were the woman who beheaded Jason's mother is followed home. Next she gets killed,and then we just she a group of kids telling the Jason legend. They opened the camp again and are naive enough to think after a few years there safe(lol). Anyways the movie moves to slow and the death scenes are the lamest in the series(a guy in a wheelchair gets a hatchet in his head and flies 50ft down a flight of stairs)I mean come on. Also whats with the stupid ku klux klan mask jason has in this film. The ending is the only good thing about this film and that doesn't make up for a wasted 70 minutes. BOTTOM LINE STICK TO (FRIDAY THE 13th 1,6)"
3,A LITTLE BORING,ITS A GOOD FIRST INTRY OF JASON BUT ITS TO BORING THEY HAVE DEATH SECOND AFTER SECOND THERES A LITTLE TOO MUCH NUDITY
2,Steve Miner's Friday the 13th Part 2,"I did not like this sequel very much. We see in the first movie that Mrs. Voorhees(Betsy Palmer) was killed by Alice(Adrienne King). And at the beginning sequence Alice is killed by someone(I wish that she didn't have to die). The Killer is Jason! He back for revenge for his mothers death. This time he stalks Ginny(Amy Steel) five years later, and more counselers at Camp Crystal Lake who plan to reopen it. The thing that I didn't like was that Jason wears a potato sack over his head instead of his hockey mask, which he wears in part 3, which was just as bad as this."
2,Friday's 2nd chance!,"Another clone of the original,More teens,More sex, more gore, more dull than the original. Friday the 13th part 2 is at times enjoyable ,but not as watchable as the first ,but by the end it gets better...Friday fans will enjoy this sequel."
2,ALRIGHT,THIS WAS A PIECE OF Cr** SEQUEL!!!! THE thing i likeed is tahtchick was hot!!!! the thing i made fun of constently was that horriblemask he was wering what the hell was that a duffle bag??? END
1,Is there anything good about this movie?,"Yes...it let's you know how bad movies really can get. The sad thing is that is not exactly true. Because there were other sequels of this series that were worse. Despite a teriffic musical score, this movie should not have been made. The characters of this pathetic sequel, you can not even care about, one iota. By the way, Wes Craven had nothing to do with any of the friday the 13th's. GRADE: D-"
4,Classic 80's Slasher,"I remember this as being one of the first horror movies I ever saw. I also remember thinking that it was very similar to the Burning which I saw around the same time. This is the U.S. Region free release with the original cover art unlike the awful U.K. release. The movie itself is really of it's time. You couldn't get away with it now, but I prefer this by far to modern horror fodder. The picture is probably the best it has been. It is not spectacular so don't expect it to be up to today's standards, but it doesn't have to be, it is grainy in places and clean in others. The extras are pretty good as well, however if you're expecting notorious deleted scenes, an explanation as to why you will never see them is as much as you'll get"
2,Worth it for Several Choice Jolts,"Sure there's no real plot, a lot of the acting is embarrassing and the dialogue will make you cringe, but there are at least five great jolts that had me jumping in my seat. It's probably better than the original only in that there really aren't as many good scares in the predecessor. Incidentally, I remember reading that they actually filmed the double impaling scene but were forced to cut it to get an R rating. I wish Paramount would restore the footage for DVD."
5,"CH,CH,CH,HA,HA,HA","I loved the first one and I loved the 2nd one because this is the debute on the main event evil killer himself JASON VOORHEES. the writing,directing and fx were good plus it was in my opinion scary next to the first one it was the best of the series, If you have not seen this movie then rent it or buy it it is worth it."
3,Friday the 13th Part 2,"Friday the 13th Part 2 was ok but not as scary as the 3rd one. After Jason's mother died he comes back to do his mother's job, killing teens. Even though Jason doesn't have his hockey mask doesn't mean it ..... but still I seen better. Jason soon finds his hockey mask in Friday the 13th Part 3."
2,another corny slasher,"This was another campy slasher movies it bored me to death with really not much of a plot. Alot of the counslers die without you ever hearing them talk or learning there names. But the absoult worst thing about this movie is the ending where jason pops through a window, the screen flashes and we see the girl going into an ambulence saying ""where is my boyfreind"" thats all. Dont waste your time or money."
3,"Better than the first, but still...","Now Jason's back to kill some teenagers. Great! The movie is more scarier than the first, but can't compare to the rest. And I really miss the hockey mask, Jason seems so human :( But it has some great killings. It's also Steve Miner's first directing job, and there's a reason why he directed pt.3 as well. Now I really regret why I gave pt.3 only 3 stars, but OK. Just as you know, pt.3 is much better than this one. Have a good kill!"
1,A USLESS SEQUEL TO AN AWFUL FILM.,Oh we get to see jason for the first time yipee!!!. That's basiclly the plot folks exce[pt for the usual blood and guts no plot and no suspense crap. That is asssociated with this film and the others after it. P.S if you want horrible acting this film has it all too!!!
2,Only for the die hard Jason fans,"I'll make this short, Friday 2 is amoung the lamest and dullest of the series. It is not funny or scary and the characters are terrible, except for the wheelchair guy Mark and Crazy Ralph. The only thing that really keeps it above terrible is the last ten minutes and a few of the death scenes were especially good.My advise skip this one and go for the much funner and entertaining Friday 3. Only see this one if you are a die hard Jason fan( like myself ).2 out of 4 stars."
3,Ok now this flick still creeps me?,I'm 30 yrs old and this film still gives me the willies! I have no clue why? I think it is the forest setting and the fact that Jason wears a gunny sack over his head? Amy Steel was pretty good too! No point to this review or movie but what the heck it was and still is entertaining!
5,"Friday The 13th, Part 2","First off, ill just start this by saying that I liked this movie better than the first. More killings, and just moved alot better than the first, which ALSO was good but it moved a little slow to me. In this one you get to see Jason, which was also a good thing. This movie is packed with a lot of suspense, and alot of killings which makes it a good horror movie! If you want to check out all of the Friday The 13th's, start with the first, then this one. But this is better in my opinion. Just more too it.One thing that wasn't that good, was at the end it didn't show/say what happened to people at the end. But I guess i'll see in Part 3. But overall, if you wan't a good horror movie this is for you."
2,Friday the 13th part 2- an improvement?,"The tales of Jason Voorhees and his demented mother now remain legends in the notorious Camp Crystal. Can all be laid to rest now that Mrs. voorhees is dead? Not so as the story continues. Soon the murders start again, a new killer is at large. Who could it possibly be? Penned by a different author (Amy Steele) it was a slight improvement on the original. I stress 'slight'. The opening sequence was indeed full of suspense and terror as the woman who killed Mrs. voorhees is murdered by the new killer. So is Jason back from the dead or is it just a myth? Overall the slasher saga has worn out and should have ended here but unfortunately it doesn't and goes on and on and on........sinking to worse depths of madness."
2,"The Very Best of the sequels, BUT...","...WHY another cut/edited version of this classic slasher film???? I am a great fan of Friday the 13th series, especially the first four (4) films.I think there is nothing much more to say about this otherwise fine example of the 1980's slasher genre. You can find so many previous reviews concerning the plot, contents etc. of this film right here in Amazon... However, for the full uncut version I would give 5 stars right away!Best regards to you all folks!"
4,Old School Slasher,I grew up in the 80's. Friday the 13th Pt2 is just as good and in some ways better then the original. This is the introduction of Jason who leaves a gift for the survivor. A gift she may or may not live to remember. The challenge with Friday the 13th PT2 is not to have too much fun watching it. You'll either be swept away in all it's high terror and suspense or amazed at all the different ways Jason takes out his victims. These are the films that started it all after Halloween surfaced. Friday the 13th 1-3 are classic slasher films.You MUST add this to your collection of horror movies. It's fun to watch again and again.
3,"Best of the series, 3.7 stars out of 5","I found part 2 to be more entertaining than part 1. Don't bother watching the rest of the sequels that follow...bad acting, senseless kills, and just stupid errors plague the rest of the series. The suspense is lost after parts 1 and 2. Part 2 took me by surprise and is still my favorite friday the 13th movie. Part 1 is my 2nd favorite."
4,Return to Camp Blood,"Friday the 13th pt. 2 isn't the best horror sequel but it sets up the bloodbath to come quite nicely.Five years have passed since the first film [(although it was released the following year. explain that one?)] a man named Paul Holt holds a camp counselor training seminar on the other side of Crystal Lake. One by one the counselors begin to die in a brutal and bloody manner that we've come to expect with the Friday series.The story is good for the series although it is rather limited. The acting is mediocre at best and so is the dialogue. Although they're are a few good moments here and there.A good movie. Not great, but good."
2,Same as the first...a liiiiittle better,"Nothing special bout the movie...still like the concept, but the movie is still boring to me. I'm not at the edge of my seat except for a part or two. Pretty bad, but if you liked the first (which i don't know how you could) than I'm pretty sure you'll like this one."
3,Not a bad sequel,"Not a bad sequel at all. Like Halloween 2, there is always is something new good. This one isnt as good as the first one but stills make the best effort it could possibly do. This one introduces jason and a new set of camp counselors for him to feed on. More gore and more charcter but not as much scares as the other one. I still think its worth to buy though along with the first one. This one still has a plethora of frights but not as much as the first one. In all this is not a bad sequel and is recommended to all horror fansalong with the first one."
3,GOOD INTRO OF HORROR LEDGEND,"O.K., LETS START WITH JASON'S REVENGE AT START. JASON WAS FUELED WITH SUCH GRIEF AND HATRED,I'TS BELIVABLE HE WOULD DO WHAT IT TOOK TO SEEK THE COUNSLER OUT THAT KILLED HIS MOTHER. THIS SHOWS JASON MEANS BUSSINESS. THIS IS RAW FORM JASON. STARTING HIM OUT LOOKING AMATEURISH, RATHER THAN BEING IMMORTAL WITH HOCKEY MASK, WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THIS WAY,PEOPLE SEE THAT HE WAS SO IN A HURRY TO HIDE HIS FACE, ALL HE COULD FIND WAS A PILLOW CASE.HIS CLOTHES MAKE SENSE SINCE HE CAN'NT WALK INTO A STORE AND BUY THEM. HE WOULD HAVE TO STEAL THEM. AS FOR THE REST OF THE STORY, I'TS THE SAME BASIC PLOT, COUNSLERS GET KILLED IN THE NAME OF REVENGE. THE WHOLE SERIES LEAVES UNANSWERED QUESTIONS,AND HAS FANS TRYING TO ANSWER THEM.THE MAIN GOAL OF THESE FILMS IS TO GET A CHEAP THRILL, AND NOT TRY TO DISECT THEM. TO THIS DAY I KEEP WONDERING ,WHAT HAPPEND TO PAUL."
4,Fridays on Blu ray!,"It's definitely interesting seeing these films hit blu ray. They definitely look better, and it's nice for fans to be able to upgrade. I was going to buy the DVD boxset, but now that they're all coming to blu ray, why not upgrade?Each film has special features and a clean new master, it's a worthy purchase for any fan. This blu ray of part 2 has great extras, I watched them all, and the movie looks much cleaner then i remember when I saw it on my old 1999 released DVD of the film."
2,"Not THAT good, but still enjoyable...","""Friday the 13th part 2"", while not as well thought out as the first, is more enjoyable than its predecessor, despite its fluffiness. It actually takes place in 1985, tho it was made only a year after the original, at a camp *near* Camp Crystal Lake. There are AlOT more counslers this time, but most of them remain namless, and we don't really hear them say anything. Only about 9 of them, or something, get killed when left behind at camp, while the others go to a bar. The only two things that bothered me about this installment was that it felt too short. Actually, it IS the shortest 'Friday film in running time. The other problem being the death of Alice. I really liked her charector! And it wasn't even necessary to the rest of the film that she dies...Did anyone else feel sorry for her?!?!?! BUT, Ginny, the new heroine is also great. I DO reccomend this only if you don't tale slasher pics too seriously."
4,Very Enjoyable,This movie was a lot of fun to watch.The acting is better than you would expect and there were quite a few suspenseful moments.The ending left you wondering what really happened.Did Paul live or die?
2,not so good,I didn't like this one. This one just was stupid. it didn't have any real surprises. But still is pretty good overall
1,You've got to be kidding me,"OK, the first one was a cheap rip-off of Halloween; but this one has got to be one of THE WORST horror films ever made. At least the first one had a fascinating killer and a decent plot. The second installment in this cruddy series of horror movie knockoffs is once again about a bunch of teenagers who work at a summer camp and get slaughtered one by one. Jason is a pitiful excuse for a killer, and his character is obviously a knockoff of Michael Myers. If you want a true slasher movie, go for Scream or Halloween. Even The Fog and Prom Night are better than this. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the lowest I can go is 1."
1,Again?,"Oh bless you, Paramount! Yet another theatrical cut of F13 P2 without deleted scenes? I'm just giddy with anticipation. The couple of paltry extras sure make me wanna shell out my hard-earned money for another disc. Forever in your debt...[Edit: To those fans thinking they'll give up their dollars because this edition is remastered--save your money! If you haven't seen the Fridays on Blu-ray, do so. The upconvert to 1080p is stellar, and makes the movie look new and fresh.]"
2,PRETTY INFERIOR SEQUEL,"THIS SEQUEL INTRODUCES JASON VORHEES, THE MANIACAL AXE MURDERER WHO'S KNOWN FOR HIS HOCKEY MASK [WELL, HERE HE WEARS A WHITE SHEET FOR A MASK, HE DOESN'T WEAR THE HOCKEY MASK UNTIL PART 3].IN THIS SEQUEL, JASON EMERGES FROM THE DEAD TO KILL ALL THE TEENS AT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE OUT OF VENGEANCE TO WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS MOTHER IN THE 1ST MOVIE. THIS IS REALLY MORE OF A REHASH THAN A SEQUEL. THERE REALLY ISN'T THAT MUCH EXCITEMENT UNTIL THE LAST 15 MINUTES. I'D RECCOMEND THIS SEQUEL TO ANY DIE-HARD FAN OF THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES, BUT TO ANYONE ELSE, I'D RECCOMEND ''HALLOWEEN'' OR ''A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET''."
3,Decent little sequel,The films in the Friday The 13th series were never meant to be award winning films. They were made to give us a jolting good time in the theater and Part is no execpation. The film has lots of gore and cool death scenes. Although the film isn't as scary if released today it introduces us to horror's oringial bad boy with the hockey mask.
2,part 2 is a big bloodless bore,"boring characters and a horde of bar hopping survivors make part 2 the worst of the first 7 friday films. not to mention its heavily edited content, which leaves the entire film almost completely bloodless with poor cutaways and offscreen kills. amy steel is great but jason really sucks in this one. he's clumsy and goofy and is slowed down by a kick to the groin and a really pathetic psychological trick. i havent been able to make it to the end of part 2 in years and i love these movies. who wouldnt love it if it was uncut right? but the person at paramount who is in charge of marketing and researching public demand has been out to lunch for over a decade."
2,Far beyond terrible sequel,"We all know any film with the title ""Friday the 13th"" isn't going to be exactly Oscar worthy, but Part 2 is worse than it should be. Where as the first film had a few genuine scares and thrills, this installment isn't scary one bit, not to mention the killings aren't exactly creative (look to the later films for some creative deaths) and the direction of the film is overly sloppy, and Jason isn't scary here one bit, but thats acceptable considering this is the first film where Jason himself is the killer. While there are a few half decent moments, the rest of Friday the 13th Part 2 falls flat on its face. However this isn't the worst entry in the series (go see Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday) and it does offer a bit of fun that horror buffs can get a kick out of."
2,PREITY BAD,"I think this movie was not that good because it was kind of corny, because jason has a bag on his head and the kills are not that great eather. 1 was better i thought this was like Leprecahun. but if you likcorny flicks this is good fr you."
3,goofy fun movie,alrite it is not scary but it is fun and that is what makes friday te 13th series specail i liked the death scenes especaily the impalment i thought that wa verry original and not as good as the original still worth watching
3,fun movie,alrite it is not scary like halloween 2 (which came out the same year as this on 1981) but still it has a errie atmoshere you jump at the cheap scares laugh at the stupid teenagers and like the original it has a campy feeling to it its a fun movie and i would recomend it if you liked the first one even though i liked this one more than the first one.
3,"Except for the very good and Bloody Deaths, this Movie Sucks","I thought this movie had a lot more blood, gore, and T&A; than the original, but the acting as well as no hint of any sort of plot caused this movie to [stink]. I know stalk/slash movies are supposed to have very little plot, but this one had basically no plot! You have to have at least some sort of plot to keep motivation for the characters! The orginal and bloody deaths, however, made me give this 3 stars. There is also a great scene where we see a girl completly naked(full frontal)!!!Positives - Great Bloody Deaths, Hot Girl NakedNegatives - No Plot, Terrible Acting"
1,"""It [stinks], it really [stinks]!!!""","Like I said before, I'm not new to the character Jason Voorhees, but it was still waiting for the Hockey-Masked Jason. But this one is just Jason wearing a bag over his head. And he showed his face at the end and he didn't look anything like in the 3rd movie, when he showed his face to be bald and ugly. So, this one [stinks] just as bad as the first one, Friday the 13th isn't Friday the 13th without the Hockey-masked Jason."
2,Not very scary,"I really liked the first Friday the 13th, because it was genuinely scary. This sequel has a good premise and a fine scary ending, but overall it just didn't scare me at all. The murders were weakly executed with very little sound effects. The killer became too anonymous. There was too much undressing of girls. And the hair-dos were so funny, I kept laughing and wishing for hairdressers to jump out of the woods, ready to cut off about 2 tons of hair :)But the ending was worth sitting through this weakling of a horror movie. It's suspenseful, believable, twisty and most importantly: it shows how Jason copes without his mother. Kill, kill!"

5,4 stars for horror,"I love this one! Jason is really creepy with that bag over his head, and the reason the first 3 were scary is that we didn't know Jason. I love all of them (with the exception of 5), but these are all great."
4,Not what I remebered but a good movie,Its not what I remebered but I still like the movie. No extras on this one like normal for all of the series but the movie quality is still excellent.
3,Friday the 13th part 1 v2.0,"This one is just a rehash of the first movie, however it does feature some good death scenes and tries to bring the two films together with a lengthy prologue featuring the survivor from the first film. However, with its inflated budget and more polished look, one can't help but notice that it looks like the creators were just trying to make this movie into what they wanted the first one to be. The picture quality on the DVD is mediocre to good, however the sound is once again in mono only, which really detracts from the listening experience. There are no extras on this disc aside from a theatrical trailer."
5,Like the Original,"I really was pleased with this sequel. I thought it was scary, and I liked how the new camp was right next door to the old one. It was very similar to the original, and I think that's good because I love the original. I definetly recommend this movie to anyone who likes ""Friday the 13th""."
4,The best one and now it is on DVD,"Parammount introduces us to a great transfer of Friday the 13th part 2. the picture quality is nearly perfect and looks new, colors are strong and solid with no grain at all but during the movie there is minor speckling at some scenes, but it is nothing distracting at all, and for a 20 year old movie the image quality can make anyone think this movie is recent. good sound quality. the only actual extra is a theatrical trailer but still this DVD is worth it for it's good transfer and because it is a great movie in generall. i recommend it to all fans of the genre. Now here is how i grade it.Movie: B+Image: A-Sound: BExtras:C-"
1,just copying the halloween series,this is the worst follow up to an origanal ive seen just basically repeating what mrs voorhees did in the origanal.friday 13th should stop copying halloweens-at least the halloween 2 did an impressive job and come to think of it so did all the sequels up to resurrection brill-this franchise shouldve died round about the time this movie was released
3,If you like sequels...,"Sequel to the original has Jason taking revenge for his mother's decapitation by hacking up another bunch of teens trying to open a summer camp close to Camp Chrystal Lake. Makes no effort to separate itself from the first, which is probably why this is so enjoyable. Only if you liked the first."
4,The second best FRIDAY movie,This movie was surprisingly good. The murders are pretty original. Although some resembled murders in the original film. Very good though. I like the fact that it still centres around a camp. Worth watching!
2,better than the original but not by a landslide,"this is the same tired story line as the original. Teens go to camp and get killed. But the this movie is more exciting due to better charachter vividness, unlike the first ""friday"" in which i did not know who was who. This movie generates sympathy and it offers one of the best showdowns of the ""friday"" series."
2,totally lame,"jason is back,to kill more teens for no reason like he does in all the friday the 13ths.this one is the worst of them all.i saw the third one before seeing this and i understood it fine.you dont have to see this one to understand any of the rest.a couple scary parts but you could tell they were gonna happen.skip this one"
2,one of the worst of the series,"this film was the worst of the series, right up there with part 5. the acting is bad, and it was steve miner's first directing job, and i'm afraid that it shows. even though i suppose that it's a worthy sequel, this is simply a poor film with some of the worst acting. jason was skinny and rather weak-looking here, and yet in part 3 (which happens in the same day, mind you)he is all muscular-looking...i don't know."
4,Same plot. Different killer!,"Okay, it's 5 years after the original nightmare and yet another group of teens get killed off 1 by 1. All that changes is this... A new killer, kid's at a camp nearby the original camp (crystal lake) Thats virtually it, oh and Jason is grown up and wheres a bag over his ugly head (like the elephant man) Although I still liked this sequel, I'd rather watch this than the first."
4,"For some reason, this installment actually scared me...","I don't know why - I find most others in this series incredibly HILARIOUS - but there were scenes in this film where I was really scared. I can't think of the specific scenes - but it is scary - at least, I think so.Also, where Crazy Ralph gets strangled with the barbed-wire... it's a little nasty."
5,Friday the 13th Part 2,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the camp here's even more heart-pounding terror.Five years after the horrible bloodbath at Camp Crystal Lake, all that remains is the legend of Jason Voorhees and his demented mother, who had murdered seven camp counselors. At the nearby summer camp, the new counselors are unconcerned about the warnings to stay away from the infamous site. Carefree, the young people roam the area, not sensing the ominous lurking presence. One by one, they are attacked and brutally slaughtered. Suspense and screams abound in this compelling thriller.This film is presented in a widescreen format."
3,I want an unrated version of this movie,"Friday the 13th Part 2 was the first slasher movie I ever saw and it scared me half to death. For years afterwards, Jason chased me around in my dreams wearing that horrific white sack over his head. I never found the hockey mask to be as compelling, but I was a little older and much more callous by the time Jason donned if for the first time. I would eagerly shell out full price for an uncut version of this flick, as it will always be among my favorite movies. Maybe one day we'll get just such a gem on Blu-Ray. But as for this release, no thanks. I already own the box set."
5,"Sugar-Free Cheesecake, Cupcakes, and More","If you think nutritious food has to be boring and tasteless, you need this cookbook! Every recipe I've tried has been truly delicious, without sugar, honey, or artificial sweeteners. There are many wheat- and dairy-free dishes included, which is very helpful for families like mine with food sensitivities. And I have a new favorite pot roast recipe--sorry, Mom.All the recipes are kid-friendly, and you will feel wonderful replacing empty snacks with real whole grains your family will actually eat. Even people who can't stand ""health food"" will love these recipes!"
5,Finally - a cookbook I could really use,"Being sensitive to sugar and trying to eat whole grains, it has not been easy to find a cookbook that I could use. This cookbook has finally given me a chance to feel like I could enjoy food like everyone else. I even found my husband enjoying some of the cakes I made - and he only enjoys the real sweet stuff."

3,"Christy Essence Robe, Indigo","I bought this robe for a Christmas present for my boyfriend.I really wasn't sure from the description of the size or gender this robe was supposed to be for. I got it and I guess it was a one size fits most but it didn't say. I also could still not tell what gender it was for but looked as if it was for a male but the fact that it was called Christy Essence I still wasn't sure. Well my boyfriend is quite small-wears a medium usually. This was o.k., a little big, but much heavier than he would like. I don't really like to buy things that will take a long time to dry which I am sure this would due to it's weight. It was made well for those of you who like a heavyweight robe and attractive but I ended up having to return this one...Hope this helps with your decision. Happy shopping!"
4,Useful and enjoyable reading!,"I can recommend this book to anyone sailing in New England's (or other) foggy waters. The writing style is very enjoyable and makes good use of case studies in dead reckoning to demonstrate the skills explained.By Nadine Slavinski, author ofLesson Plans Ahoy!: Hands-on learning for sailing children and home schooling sailors"

2,Boring,"I thought this book would be more suspenseful but I found it boring. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because I did manage to finish it. If you're looking for a good ""can't put it down"" mystery, then don't bother with this book."

3,what the... batman!,"hi this batman toy is great if you have a toy castle or building or something like that. but if you just have your bedroomand this is one of your first toys this toy is not good for you.basicly, you need to have 5 other action figures 3 for bad guysand 2 for batmans freinds and 3 toy buildings 1 for a old warehouse1 for the good guy hideout and 1 for the city if not this toy willsoon be in the toy box for a 8 month stay.the toys quality is finehe just cant move his leggs hi engough. if you are just startingto buy toys for the young 5-7 kid you need a couple of supplies first.pros:the kit has some good supplies.the cape is finaly made from cloth.hands can hold alot of objects including small stickscons:the kit has no swords.batmans not flexible at allhands cant turn.all in allITS A GOOD TOY"

5,Mighty Fine Album,"Honest lyrics and Sam's impressive voice make another great album with excellent songs that was worth waiting for. I only wish it could have the same fine recording excellence that Audioquest was able to produce. Direct Stream Digital technology on this Telarc recording is surely ok, however, this album doesn't really create the sound space,the acoustic depth, and intensity as was captured in his earlier work with Audioquest. This album is probably more ""polished"" with its powerful horn section than his previous albums, so some atmosphere around the closeness to his ""breathing"" went missing as a trade-off. Also Bruce Katz on piano has less chances to impress and to create the kind of intimate musical stage that is the trademark of earlier work with Mighty Sam. Nevertheless, mighty fine songs on a mighty fine album."
2,Don't know have not been able to use it.?,"I recently purchased this unit and received it within a reasonable amount of time. When I took the unit out of the box, the left tire was totally deflated. I now have a winter storm coming with a lot of snow and a snow blower with a flat tire sitting in my garage. I wrote the manufacturer and amazon. Amazon told me it would take 20 days at most to get the part.It is over 2weeks now and still no tire or email, nothing. Getting frustrated. The unit works and looks sturdy. Will probably work well when snow hits but useless without tires..."
1,Piece of Junk,"I just got this yesterday at Home Depot in anticipation for a big storm. I went out into the storm and it started right away. It worked really well for the first ten feet, then no throwing. The auger belt had slipped off so I had to fix it. After fiddling with the assembly (the instructions are terrible) and ending up with a sore back trying to get the plastic belt cover on and off (which is what the instructions say to do and does NOT ""slide"" out as stated- and it turns out isn't even necessary), I noticed that it was still quite loose. I started it up and it fell right off. I am incredibly angry to say the least. Now I'm stuck shoveling with a bad back. I have read the other reviews and can't wait for those flat tires, too!"
4,Massachusetts,"I would have given 5 stars, but gave only 4 because its controls are little difficult to handle. May be upon some practice I may be used to it.But it works great. No issues so far. I have used this 3 times (10-15 inches of snow), it stars in one stroke. Excellent product."
5,Great Big little machine,"I don't understand the other reviewers stating it is hard to control. If you can walk and chew gum at the same time,you will have no problem with this blower. Two levers. Top one engages the auger, bottom one engages the wheels. The levers are both on top at the handle where you hold on. As soon as you let go of either of the levers that portion stops instantly. Very light which is a big plus. I can pull it backwards with one finger. An added plus is that it comes pre filled with oil. Out of the box you can be up and running within two minutes (if you have gas handy) Simply tighten the handles, double check the oil fill plug is tight, fill it up and get ready to blow. Great Value great machine. I live in Up State NY where we get plenty of snow. 113 inches last week and I got this blower for my wife to use on our back deck, so she doesn't kill her back shoveling, while I'm using my 13 HP Husqvarna to do the driveway and every where else."
5,Yard Machine22-inch 5.5 HP Gas -Powered Dual Snow Thrower,"The snow blower arrived on time, it was the exact thing I order, it is east to start and easy to use. It's not good in wet snow it will freeze up and you will have to clear the passage way. It is heavy but it really gets the job done. Easy to start and easy to guide,I love it, best one yet and I have had many snowblowers.Clara"
1,Quite possibly the worst money I've ever spent,"An absolutely pathetic product from the first moment I tried to use it.This little monster came out of the box with a flat tire. Not bad considering that the rim was secured in place with an impact wrench, making it virtually impossible to replace without stuffing the entire blower back into the car.But that's what it's been like. After spending $100 last year on a carb, it actually worked first try during the snowstorm a few weeks ago. But tonight, it screwed up again. The snow collector stopped turning, and after some desperate experimentation, it turned out to be the wire that activates it.I've never seen a device which so thoroughly demonstrated complete disregard for the customer and basically slovenly design. It belongs in the garbage."
4,More than enough power for a Michigan Winter.,I've owned 3 snow blowers in the past. This is the first dual-stage however. It is very powerful and easy to use. The only thing that is a bit awkward is the handle controls. One is on top of the handle and one is underneith the handle. You have to squeeze both together to get the unit to function. You have to be careful and pay attention as to which to disengage. It can be a bit tricky with heavy gloves on. That being said I still think it was a very good buy at $500. It's definately more machine than I will ever need. Nice to know it's there if we get a foot or more of snow!
1,Garbage,"A piece of trash. Not only do I have the tire problem. And let me tell you that when you have 3 feet of snow to plow through, the first thing that you do not want to do is have to inflate the tires. And inflating would be easy, but these tires fall completely off the rim and repairing is quite a project. And it happens A LOT!The machine doesn't always start. Another big flaw.The belts keep stretching and burning out. Believe me, changing the belt is not a lot of fun either in the snow and cold.A snowblower needs to be reliable otherwise it becomes more of a headache than the snow itself."
3,Problem with Auger Belt Slippage,"I haven't had a chance to use this unit yet as i spent a week trying to fix it myself after discovering that the auger wasn't spinning out of the box. After giving up and taking it in for service, the mechanic got the auger belt to stay on by means of taking a crowbar to push the engine assembly forward. Apparently the way this thing is designed results in a lot of torque that will eventually, through shipping or time, push the auger belt off. The repair was covered under warranty but it was pretty frustrating to deal with all of this for $500 bucks. Can't wait to try it out tommorow through. Bring on the white-out!"
2,Features and value good but not durable at all -- BEWARE,The cheap plastic brackets that secure both the drive cable and auger cable broke off after only 2 or 3 moderate uses of this snowblower. And the user's manual and MTD website did not clearly indicate whether replacements were available. Are they part of the cables themselves? Bottom line is I spent about $500 and got only a few uses before the unit became totally inoperable.
2,Too Big,"Construction of the shoes was great but it was one size too big and the calf size was more like a size 17"". Very comfy too bad they made me look like I was wearing goulashes."
5,A very comfortable pump!!!,"I purchased my Avent pump just a few days before I gave birth and decided to go with the Avent manual pump because of the key word ""Naturally"" on the box. I prefer anything natural, organic, pure, etc. I used it right away because of the latch on trouble I had in the beginning with my son. I expressed my milk and fed it to him with a bottle. Within a few days, my son finally latched on to me without a problem and I was able to protect my milk supply. My son is now 5 months old and is still breastfed and I plan to continue to nurse him until he is about a year and a half. If you're a stay at home mom, this pump is PERFECT for you! It's very gentle and comfortable as well. It's worth the price!"
3,Great pump but not durable,"I've used 3 different pumps, and one was even a hospital grade pump, and I found that I liked this one the best. It felt like I had more control over the milk flow than I did with electric/battery operated pumps, and it seemed to work the best on me. However, I used this pump only occasionally and it still broke on me (right at the base of the pump shaft). In my opinion, they need to upgrade the material they're using, as it is not very durable. If it weren't for that I probably would have given it a five star rating, but since I didn't get my money's worth out of it, I feel I can only give it a 3. Good luck to all!"
5,Quick and easy.,"This is the perfect pump for working mothers (or if you just want to pump so you can rest at least once a week!). I recommend buying this version because it is cheaper than the disposable version. If you want the bags for storage, just go out and buy them. The back to work version can be easily put together with a small cooler and some ice packs. Also, don't try to pump before two weeks! It will hurt because you don't really have alot of milk to pump. Finally, you need to hold in the pump before attaching it to your breast otherwise it will hurt. My sister told me that. After getting the hang of it, I can pump four ounces in about 15 minutes or less."
3,Like it but . . .,"I was really pleased with the Avent Isis at first - comfortable, quick, easy. But lately, the neck piece slips out of position and it is very hard to keep the pump and bottle together while using. And I've been using it for less than 3 months, and only a few times weekly. So I'm not too happy about the durability."
3,Can be useful but depends,"This pump worked great for me. With my new born daughter I had a lot of milk and pumped at least 8oz from each breast. With this pump - I could do this is about 6 minutes per breast. I had some problems with my milk backing up and would have to stop to allow the milk to drain into the bottle - this could just be because I am a human cow. I found the pump compact and useful but it has to be completely taken apart and reassebled each time it is cleaner or sterilized. I think it breaks up into 8 or 9 parts. If you are exclusively pumping then stay away from this pump - your baby will be hungry every 3 hours or you will need to pump every 3 hours, it will take you time to pump and then you have to take the thing apart, put it in the sterilizer and put it together again for the next use. Believe me you will have little time for anything else!!! even if you use a microwave sterilizer. For the ocassional pump I think it is a great buy"
5,Kudos to Avent,"I have used this pump for nine months several times a day and find that it has been a wonderful product...and I have tried The First Years electric pump and found that this one was much faster and much more comfortable. I have not had any problem with the plastic, though you do need to remember to use non-antibacterial soap and to use distilled water in the microwave steam sterilizer if you are sterilizing this way because if you use antibacterial soap, you can actually change the chemistry of the plastic and make it brittle. I don't find this care to be any problem at all and this pump is WONDERFUL!"
5,what a lifesaver,"last night my milk came in and today I was becoming more and more engorged as the day went by. The baby just couldn't keep up. I was in so much pain,but dreaded the pump because with my oldes I tried the evenflow and was in so much pain it brused my nipples and all for not even an oz. of milk. I read about this one one here and decided it was worth a try. The min.I got home from the store I put the baby on one side and assembled the pump in no time at all. I was able to get 2oz in about 3 min. with no effert at all. If the parts break like some say they do , they seem easy enough to replace so I think it is worth it. I hope it works for me when I go back to work, even if I need to buy another to double pump, it should be worth it."
1,Not worth the money.,"Well I somehow ended up getting the Isis manual Breast Pump in the mail for free & the only thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't shell out money for this pump! It's terrible.I sat for about 15 minutes trying to pump either breast & I think I succeeded in getting a drop to appear on one nipple! lol I could see the suction was working, but not particularly strong & it didn't do a thing.I read the other reviews & I guess it depends on the person as some people obviously have no problems & others can't get the darn thing to work at all. So if at all possible I would advise borrowing one from a friend to try out first to see if you can have any success before purchasing this pump."
1,Don't waste your money,"This pump is terrible. It causes severe nipple pain. To the point that the next time I nurse my baby after using it my nipples still hurt, and that never happens otherwise. It also is not very effective. If I am not engorged it takes about 40 minutes of pumping to get 2 ounces. If I am engorged it takes about 20 minutes to get 2 to 3 ounces, but still does not empty my breasts. There have been times I have been engorged and still couldn't get anything. One time I pumped for about 45 minutes because I needed milk to take to the babysitter I only got 2 ounces, and it made one of my nipples bleed. Also the only bottles that will attach to it are the Avent bottles, and they do not support breatfeeding. I am switching to the Platex pump and nurser system, which do an exellent job of supporting breastfeeding."
4,Good for occasional pumping,"This pump is good if you only need to pump once or twice a day. It's small, easy to clean and can be thrown in the diaper bag for on-the-road access. It's a little trying on your hand - but not nearly as bad as the one they give you from the hospital.If you pump all the time, or most of the time - I would suggest the Medela automatic pump. It gets far more milk out each time and takes about 1/3 the time."
5,Best pump,"This pump works great, especially in the beginning, when it is harder to get your milk to let down, you can increase the suction. Later, you need less. The electric pump I tried to attempt to speed up my pumping time was slower and only about a third of my milk came out - Plus it was noisy as hell, quite embarassing at work. At first my hand did get a little tired, but once I had used the pump for a couple weeks, I did not experience that anymore. I worked and nursed for 11 months, pumping every day and the pump held up great. I will buy another one for my next baby, because it definately showed some wear, but for the price - that's not a problem. I also recommend getting the (electric)sterilizing system from Advent. These two items made my daily routine while working and nursing much quicker and easier."
5,GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO ELECTRIC PUMPS,"This pump actually allows me to pump as much as an electric pump. The only advantage I find with electric is you can do both sides at once. Otherwise, with a little practice, ISIS is very efficient. It has as much pull as the electric pump.This is great for those moms who want to pump occasionally for an outing or those who want about the same performance as from an electric pump, but just can't see putting that much money in one.One tip:works best when baby begins to skip feedings, pumping during the skipped feeding,-or- set aside a specific time daily to pump, teaching your body to supply at that time."
2,Save your money for something more accurate,"I wanted this breastpump because I am a huge Avent customer. Unfortunatley, breast milk always got between the suction and the funnel (which enables the breastpump to pump). If you're going to spend money, then spend it on a more accurate pump."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this pump because it seemed to get great reviews. Big mistake. It takes FOREVER and all that hand pumping is so tiring and frustrating that my milk wouldn't let down properly. Invest in a Medela. It's so worth the money. I guess this pump would be ok if you only pump once in a great while, but if you pump regularly don't waste your time with this one unless you have a tremendous amount of patience and want to spend all your time with either a baby or a pump attached to your breast."
2,S-L-O-W.......,"If you're a mom on the go, this is not the pump for you. It took me about an hour or so just to get a few measly ounces out of this thing. Sometimes, it made it very painful to pump as well. Yes, it's portable and not as expensive of the electric pumps but if you want to get your pumping done fast, invest the money and get an electric pump instead."
5,Love the Pump-Easy to use and quick,"I bought this pump when my son was about 6 weeks old. I tried to pump and it just didn't work. I was told that longer I would nurse him better milk supply will I establish. So after 10 weeks of just nursing him, I tried to use the pump again and it worked great. I can pump about 4-6oz in about 10-12 minutes. Since I returned back to work, it makes it really easy since I can pump so fast and not spend a whole lot time. I highly recommend this pump for anyone who is returning back to work, and who has established a good milk supply."
2,Certainly not for everyone...,"I bought this pump based on its reviews. Sadly, it takes about an hour to get 2 ounces out this way for me. The one thing I've learned with reviews of breast pumps is this - Because every woman is built differently, some pumps will work great for some and not so well for others. What I CAN tell you is this - If you are a fairly small breasted woman who must go back to work and pump while you are there, this may not be the pump for you.Other important notes:1. Fairly easy to use and put together. Reading the manual helps.2. Extended use will make your nipples sore."
2,"Overall, not happy",I bought this to have an alternative to the Pump In Style. I have found that it only works when my breasts are very full. Now that I have been breastfeeding for so long - my breasts are usually not full - and this just does not work. (...)it has cost me probably a dollar for each ounce I've managed to squeeze out of this thing. The few times I have been overly full - it works pretty well (but it does pinch a bit) - but otherwise it is a waste.
3,Great the first time around....not the second....,"My two boys are 14 months apart so there was only a matter of 9 months where this pump was put into storage before I started pumping again. The second time around, the parts refused to seal. I could not get any suction. After calling customer service, they said that the ""Petals"" may not be sealing properly and I should probably replace that part...but when I called to get a price, it cost almost $25! I could not believe it. They said that it was their ""signature"" part so it cost more...but after shipping and handling costs were added, it was only $5 less than buying a brand new pump set.I exclusively used my electric pump and never went back."
1,Save your money,"I bought this pump before deciding to make the commitment to an electric one. Well I am VERY disappointed. It has NO suction!I took it apart and re assembled 3-4 times each time and have tried using it over a course of 2 weeks now... and still no matter what I try NO SUCTION.I went and bought another one and returned the first thinking it was defective, but same thing, it pulls nothing from my breast and I can not even feel any pulling. I have ample milk supply and can easily express by hand.Save your time and money , do not buy this pump."
1,Received package with broken seal,"I have double electric Isis so I ordered this one for tar Ellington convineance. It arrive with the seal broken and the pump looked used and washed. Be careful while ordering with amazon for this, specially if you need it right away. I had to go to local store to grab a sealed one. I ordered my electric one from amazon and it didn't have any problems.The product is great, though."
1,it is terrible,"I tried couple times to pump the milk, I could not pump any milk out. I would not recommend anybody else would buy it."
4,avent pump,"Product performs as expected and this is the same product we used for our first child. After factoring in shipping, it cost as much as at the local store, but came to our door instead."
2,painfull,"I love the Avent bottles but the pump did not work good for me. It was painfull, i couldn't let down when using it and got hardly any milk because of it. I finally stopped using it and get an electric pump with my second child which is much better"
2,not as good as I expected,"I heard so many great things about this pump but am disappointed in it. After reading all these great reviews I wonder if I just got a bad one or something. No matter how slowly and conscientiously I put it together it leaks air. You can hear it leaking but it's also evident by the fact that no milk comes out. Extremely frustrating when I KNOW there's milk in there, I can see it wanting to come out but the suction just isn't there. I consider this pump money wasted."
1,"Great Product, Hard to Find Replacements","My husband brought me this pump and it took forever to use it the first time. I gave up after a week and brought an electric one. But I went back and it has worked really well. Now I love this pump.However, it is really difficult to find replacement parts. I wash the pump pretty often and some parts have cracked (it's all plastic parts anyway) from use and wash. I had to get the replacement parts from Avent directly, but they charge you an arm and leg for shipping. I finally went out and brought another one. I guess 2 pumps in 8 months is not so bad.Otherwise, it really works and is a great product!"
2,"5 Stars for Design, but None for Quality","This really is a great pump! It works very fast and easily, with no pain. However, the pieces that connect the bottle to the pump handle break easily after just a month or so of use. The plastic is brittle and that area takes a lot of stress. I have now broken two pumps. You can't imagine the frustration I felt when I struggled to pump a bottle for my screaming son, and the bottle spilled all over the rug as it snapped off (twice).I would highly recommend this to someone who doesn't plan on breastfeeding long, but would like something for emergencies."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be in other reviews,"I bought the Isis pump based on the positive feedback that others gave on this website. However, my success has been minimal. I typically get 1 oz for 10 minutes of pumping. That seems like quite a waste of time to me. I would definitely not recommend this pump. It is more comfortable than the electric pumps, but definitely not as efficient."
5,I love this pump!!,"As far as I can tell this is the best manual pump available. It is very comfortable and easy to use. I'm a stay at home mom so my son only takes a bottle every other week or so but I pump every other day to make sure there is always fresh milk in the fridge for him just in case. I have never had a problem with the valve falling out and I don't have small nipples as one reviewer thought was the issue. This is a great pump for women who don't need to pump several times a day, but even when I had to pump after every feed, my left breast was drying up, it was simple and not aggravating."
5,"easy to use, quiet and efficient.","I actually can get more milk faster with this than with the cheap electric pump I bought. This one is easy to use and quiet. If you are pumping more than once a day it could get tiring, but otherwise it's great!"
1,Love Avent but not this!,"I love Avent products. When i began to ""try"" pumping I had the worst time. I was so mad I bought this pump. I could not get my milk to come out. Of course I had bought all the bottles and other products to use with it so I decided to get the electric pump. The Electric Pump worked for me!!! When you buy the electric pump it can also be used as a hand held one. You can plug it into the wall or use batterys. I love the options. It's easy to clean and put together. If you have the money I would skip over this and buy the electric!"
2,Not worth the money.,"I purchased this alongside renting a hospital grade pump. This hand pump is not worth the money. The rubber filter keeps popping out when there is a lot of suction. Maybe the women who liked this pump had smaller nipples than I do. Every time I have used this the rubber pops out. To put it back in you have to completely unscrew the cap and put your fingers in. A bad design and not at all sterile. Do not waste your money. I complained to avent and although they had good customer service and sent me out a new pump, it did exactly the same thing. It is the product itself that is defective"
2,Great when it works.....................,"I tried using this pump for about 2 days till I got too frustrated to try anymore. When I did get the proper suction the pump worked easily and my milk came down easily. It was easy and quick. However 90% of the time getting the proper suction going was the hardest thing. Thee were times when I got so frustrated from having to stop, disassemble and reassemble that I'd just give up. Maybe I did something wrong but when I called the company for help they weren't much help at all. Finally went out and bought the especially for baby electronic pump which is also about the same price and Im now a happy pumper."
2,Didn't work at all,"I got this pump when I was still pregnant, I didn't think that I would be doing a lot of pumping since I am a stay at home mom. So, it seemed like a perfect fit. I tried using the pump over and over again, and nothing. The suction just didn't work. And then after I would use it I would wash and dry it. Then the last time I tried using it, it was competely broken, no suction what-so-ever. I was really mad, because I spent a lot of money for something that I never really used, and couldn't take back. It was a waste of time and money."
3,Not as durable as it should be,"I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of a lactation specialist in the hospital where I delivered our first child. She swore by it; however, I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS! Most mentioned the neck breaking and sure enough the neck cracked within 5 weeks of purchase and I only used the pump twice a day. I felt this item was a bit costly to be so fragile, so I called the company and they tried to imply that I was using ""hard"" water to wash the bottle. Ridiculous! Nevertheless, they sent me a free replacement neck and nozzle and since I don't use it as much now as before, I don't know whether it will hold up longer. The manual hand pump makes regular usage uncomfortable for your wrist, and I found that the rubber breast guard gets soft and floppy against the warmth of your skin, thereby releasing the hold and making spillage unavoidable. I didn't want to pay the extra money for a better unit, but in hindsight I should have."
4,Best Pump Ever,"I purchased this breast pump because of the info I found on this website and I am glad I did. This is the best pump I have ever used, (I nursed two children before my last baby). My son is now 3 months and except for the neck breaking, I have had no other problems with this pump. I called Avent and they sent me a replacement part at no charge. I have been pumping since my son was about 5 weeks so he could have my milk as I have returned back to work, so I was a little upset when the part broke because I didnt want to spend money to buy a new one, but Avent was great about it. This pump is so great, I can pump up to 2 full 4oz. bottles in about 15 minutes. I also like the fact that ""let down"" occurs so fast. I can even nurse and pump at the same time. Because this pump is so wonderful I will continue to nurse my son until he is 1 year old"
3,good at first,"This pump worked well the first few weeks of occasional use. The little valve disk ripped yesterday(after about 1 1/2 months of once daily use). I put the replacement disk in and it too ripped. I called Avent about getting a replacement. They were not very helpful. The part costs $1.50 for 3, and $4.00 for shipping, and it would take a week. To have it overnited would have cost $25.00 additional dollars. I went to the store and bought the Medela Harmony for $35.00 and it seems to work well and they have some replacement parts available in Target."
2,not great,Manual pumps don't seem to work as great as electric. It was a great price and maybe works better for others.
2,It leaks,"Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but the bottle kept unscrewing and leaking all over my lap.I currently have a Medela Swing (and am renting the Medela symphony for 1 more week) but decided that I need to pump double when I go back to work so I bought this one.The pro: I hooked up the symphony on one side & this one on the other & I got more out in less time. Although, I would have had even more had it not kept leaking.I'm going to keep using it since I shelled out the money but now I know to put a towel over my lap so I don't ruin my work clothes."
4,A definite buy,I highly recommend this breast pump. It works faster than the Medela electric pump that I have. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the pump loses suction but the spare parts quickly fix that problem.
1,This product sucks,"I had put this on my registry and I regret it. A friend purchased this product and I thought it was going to work. When I got home from the hospital I had to pump, my breats were hurting pretty bad. When I went to use the breast pump didn't do anything, there was no suction. What a waste of money!!! My husband had to run up to the store late at night to purchase a breast pump that worked, which is not advent. I would think twice about purchasing this product."
1,Big waste of money,I got this pump because I wasn't returning to work. I thought I wouldn't mind the manual pump because I wouldn't need to pump often since I wouldn't be away from my baby very often. I found that I STRONGLY dislike this pump. I can sometimes get more out by squeezing my breast than I do using this pump. It is poor quality and breaks often (I've replaced parts about three times) and it simply doesn't pump much out. The rubber seal on the mouth of the pump has to be removed because it is often the reason you can't get a seal. I would NOT recommend this pump. It's a huge waste of money...
1,Complete Disappointment,"My husband and I bought this pump for our first child after I read magazine articles and on-line reviews that sang it's praises. I was hoping that it would allow my husband enjoy feeding our baby as well as make my transition back to work easier while being economical.This was not the case. I would have to pump for at least an hour to actually accumulate five - six ounces. Milk would gather under the pads which was very frustrating considering that i wanted everything to count at that point. Pumping at work with it was next to impossible because it would leak on my clothes while pumping.We ended up buying the Medela anyway and had a very different experience. It was fast, easy and clean. Even though the Medela pump is MUCH more expensive, it is DEFINITELY worth the money for the frustration you will save."
3,"Good pump, but a bit fragile","Well, I liked my Isis pump at first. It had good suction and was comfortable. Putting the many parts together after each use/washing was a bit tedious, but I didn't mind. I used it only occasionally when I was engorged, as my first child wouldn't drink from a bottle anyway. But then my seldom-used pump broke where the pump intersected with the bottle. Thinking it was just a fluke, I got another one to keep around in case of more engorgement. When it happened, I used my second Isis pump, and when unscrewing it from the bottle, IT split. In the same place, too. Now I have a four-month old infant, and I'm wanting to purchase a new pump, but it looks like I'll try a different brand, one that stands up to use a bit better."
5,Avent Great Customer Service!,"First of all I love this pump! I breastfed my daughter for 10 1/2 months and I have a son due in May. I pumped everyday and had no problems with this pump. I don't use the ""petal"" though. I had much better suction without it. One day I was sterilizing the pump on the stove in a pot of water. I forgot all about it and the funnel melted. :( I got on Avent's website and wrote Customer Service to ask them how much and where I could get a replacement funnel. They sent me one for free plus an extra valve, disc and diaphragm!!! I was amazed. That is the main part of the pump. I was so excited that I now could not recommend a better company. Thank you Avent! (Plus, my daughter will not use any other bottle.)"
2,Difficult to use,"It is very difficult to keep suction with this pump, leading to lots of wasted time and frustration. It can be useful for when you can't use an electric for emergency expression. For regular use, I recommend an electric pump. I'm using a hospital one now and I've never lost the suction."
4,Good Product,"This is a nice little pump. Good if you just want to put a little here and there, or need to release a little extra milk. I was able to pump about 4 oz in 10 mins. This is easy to put together and take apart for cleaning.What i didnt like is that this leaks some, makes a little noise, and milk gets caught in places other than the bottle. But other than that this is a pretty good product."
4,Very Good Back Up Pump for Working Mother,"I bought ISIS because I needed something compact and portable to take on a business trip. I tested it for the first time today, and I was very impress with it, because it quickly expressed 5 oz. However expessing hindmilk was a different matter, and I ended up switching to my Medela Pump in Style and got 2.5 oz more. I think this one will work fine during the day when I am in and out of meetings. At night and early in the morning I will use Medela to maintain milk supply.Although I am happy with this pump, I gave 4 stars because1. Some milk gets between parts and end up wasting.2. This is supposed to be quiet but not so. Very squeaky3. More parts to clean than Medela"
2,Not impressed,"I registered for this pump because I planned to only pump on rare occasions, so I thought it would be silly to spend the money for an electric pump... Big Mistake. This manual pump takes much longer to assemble, has more parts to clean and reassemble, and pumps significantly less milk than the Medela DoubleEase I replaced it with. Granted, there is a big difference in price, but when you're only getting 2 hours sleep at a time, the laundry is piling up, you haven't had time to go to the store or prepare dinner, and you haven't even had the energy to bathe yourself (welcome to motherhood), it seems worth the extra money to me to have a pump I can assemble in less than 10 seconds, get 4 oz. of milk in 5 minutes, and still have one arm free to hold baby."
2,Not strong enough for me,"I bought this pump because I read all of the great reviews but I have to admit that it didn't work as well for me. I originally rented a hospital pump, which worked great but I decided to save the money and invest in my own pump. I could not get as much milk out with this pump. Also, it took much longer having to do one side at a time. I would suggest renting a pump or if you plan to nurse for more than 6 months it would be worth your money to buy the more expensive electric ones. Unfortunalty, I had too much trouble breastfeeding to continue. My baby is doing excellent on formula but for those of you nursing...keep up the good work!"
4,Decent little pump at an affordable price,"I waited to buy this till I was certain I could nurse. Then since the lactation specialist recommended it in the hospital it was the first item I purchased upon my arrival home. I'm glad I did! The unit is small and convenient, not heavy or complicated to put together. It gets a little tiresome on the wrist and hands because it is manual and the pumping action hurts the hands after prolonged use but it still beats the costly electric ones. I read reviews here about the necks cracking however mine is holding up to three times a day usage so far, but I hope if it breaks AVENT will stand behind the product for a replacement. All in all this is a good investment."
4,Great but too many gadgets to assemble,"I bought the AVENT pump before I gave birth to my daughter. I did not do much research about pumps but I knew I could trust AVENT. When I began using which was within the week that I gave I realized that I had made a great investment! A hospital staff told me that could not get very much milk and encouraged me to buy an electric pump. I used both and compared the milk that I was able to pump and I did not see a difference. It takes the same amount of time to pump 4 ounzes with both pumps. The electric one was of course [money] more.The only drawback is that there are too many little gadgets to put together. I am afraid of either breaking something or loosing a part. Also, if you suffer from sore wrists or is diagnosed with carpel tunnel you might have a really difficult time because after pumping so much your wrists can hurt. So if I had to do it again I would also buy an electric one just in case."
2,Broke after 3 uses,"I love how comfortable and effective this pump is, but the quality of the plastic is really bad. I'd read the reviews here and knew that they sometimes break, so I was especially ginger with mine. But despite my care, to my horror I saw cracks developing in the threaded part of the horn after only the 3rd use. It's really broken now and I have to sort of hold it together while pumping- not easy! I've only used it about a dozen times. I emailed the company and was promised a replacement part a month ago, but it hasn't arrived-I 'm awaiting a response to my second email. A big disappointment, especially since it works so well- but I don't want to shell out the bucks for another pump that will break."
3,Really good manual pump,"I originally gave this pump only 3 stars, but as I am editing, if I could change it, I would give it 5 stars. When I first began using this pump, I hated it! Although I was getting a fair amount of milk, it was extremely painful. But I kept at it, and now it is no longer painful and actually very comfortable. It's easy to assemble, and easy to clean. I've been back at work full time for 3 months now, and up until last week, I was using the Avent pump. I just bought a Playtex Embrace (which I also love). But for any moms out there who are worried about keeping up their supply while working, and who can't afford to buy an expensive pump, the Avent is a great investment. I am pumping the same amount with the Embrace that I did with the Isis. And the total time it takes me is about the same with both the electric and the manual. The only downside with the Isis is that my hand would cramp up from pumping. I would highly recommend this pump. I still use the Isis at home."
5,Better than Medela - and I own both!,"I have two of these Avent pumps - have been pumping since my little guy was two weeks old (wanted to build up a supply). I do admit, my wrists got sore at first (double pumping) - so I caved in a bought the Medela. I used it for a month and went back to my manual pumps (your arms get used to the ""work out""). I feel I get more milk out with the manuals and I pump up to 6 times a day - I am able to express about 30 - 40 ounces of milk each day. I know each woman is very different regarding let down and expressing, but I really do think this is a superior product to Medela in that it lets you control the speed at which you pump (you can pump in ""let down"" mode the whole time if you wish) - just really pleased with this model."
4,Perfect for short term use,"As a new mom who will only nurse for a couple months, I didn't want to purchase an expensive electric pump. I opted for this and couldn't be happier. It's very easy to use (expressed 4 ozs on my very first try), washes well and I plan to use it until my son is about 3 montbs old. In addition, I use it 2-3 times a day and it's held up well. I have no complaints and reccomend this product for moms that are looking for a short term breast pump. I can see that long term use can start to wear on your wrists."
1,Did not work for me!,"I had an Isis pump with my first child and could not get it to work well. With my second child, I though I'd try the newly designed Isis and had the same problems. I could not get it to fit properly and could never get the right suction. Since you cannot return breast pumps, I was wary of trying another manual pump. I only need to pump occasionally and do not need an electric. I just got the Medela Harmony pump and from just one pumping session, I got more milk than I ever got with the Isis. I was very upset that I didn't get the results that so many reviewers raved about with the Isis. As a first time mom, I thought the problem was with me. Since my children were gaining sufficient weight, the problem was with the pumping process, not with my supply. If the Avent doesn't work for you, either try another pump or consult a lactation specialist. It may save you a few anxious moments!"
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant. I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work! I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in. I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on. I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction! I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on. I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me! I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it. A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare."
1,Don't waste your money,"This pump worked well when I was engorged right after having my son; however, when I tried to pump a couple of weeks later and needed more suction to extract milk, the pump didn't work at all. I ended up having to hand extract milk! Don't bother wasting your money on this product. Spend the extra few dollars and purchase an electric pump!"
2,What a pain!,"I had to get an electric pump after attempting to use a manual one. I got the Isis Avent because I trust the brand so much. It was awkward to use and just too much work for so little breastmilk. Electric pumps are expensive but you can get them used on e-bay, garage sales, consignment, or Craigslist for cheap."
2,This Pump Will Break,"This pump works wonderfully, but it is very fragile & will break after use. It is not reinforced where you screw the pump onto the bottle & I had 2 break on me before I taught myself how to self-pump. I couldn't continue to go drop $40 bucks on these. So, just beware."
2,Not the best,I originally wanted this pump over an electric because I loved all the reviews I read and it was economical for me to purchase. As soon as I got this pump I realized that it wouldn't express any milk for me. After reading the instructions I read that not everyone can have the petal on the pump. I had to remove the soft part of the pump and the cup without it hurts. The pump itself is very squeaky and embarassing to use in public. I still have the pump because I can't return it now but have received the Medela Pump in Style Advance as a gift. Since my baby will not nurse this pump is more for me. I encourage anyone to try the Avent pump because if the petals work with you then it's very comfortable but this pump is definitely NOT for me.
2,"Neck of Funnel Piece Cracked, Twice!!","I purchased my first pump right before my daughter was born. It worked great for the first six weeks. I would pump 4 to 6 ounces in about 5 minutes. I noticed my pump was losing suction. I took my pump apart and realized the neck to the funnel piece was cracked. I then purchased a second pump. I had it for two weeks, and the same problem, an identical crack in the same place as my first pump. My second pump still works, however it's not as effective as it was when I first purachased it. I have tried to call Avent, after being on hold for several minutes I hung up in frustration. I just purchased a medela pump in style today. I have heard great things about it."
5,Love it,"When my son was 4 days old I had to pump to get my milk to come in. I rented a Medela electric pump for a month because I did not want to spend the money to purchase the Medela system. Once my rental expired, I purchased the Avent pump. My baby is now 3.5 months old and I pump on average once per day. I have had to pump up to 4 times a day (due to eating way too spicy of a dinner) and the Avent pump is awesome. Because I am breasting from one side per feeding, it is easy for me to use the single hand breast pump. I get between 4 and 6 ounces in 5 minutes...if I'm distracted by something it may take 10 minutes. I found the Medela system to be a little painful and was usually tense right before the pump started up. I have NO pain with the Avent system. It's easy to take to Grandma's house so they can enjoy feeding their grandson too."
3,O.K for a manual pump,This is a great pump to take on the go or if you only have to pump no more than once a day. Very well made & easy to assemble. It came with 2 bottles with newborn nipples which I thought was nice also. I did notice that the milk would get clogged in the neck of the shield & I would have to remove it from my breast so it would suction in bottle. Also sometimes the membrane would flip over than there would be no suction but what can you expect for a manual pump?
3,"Handy System, Not Great Pump for Occassional Use","I love the entire Avent system. It all works so well together. But as a mother who breastfeeds almost exclusivly, this pump doesn't work well for me. I can pump and pump and get 1 oz, and then my daughter can nurse a whole bunch. It is true that there is no sucking action of that compared to a baby."
3,Not Effective for Working Mothers,"I've had the Isis for about six months now, and I'm lucky to get 2 - 3 oz. at a time with it. I bought it as an alternative to my Medela Pump-In-Style, and I wish I hadn't wasted my money. After being used to getting 12 - 16 oz. from the PIS, the Isis is especially frustrating. Also, taking all the small parts apart to clean each time is time-consuming. I'm just really disappointed in the Isis, especially after reading such wonderful recommendations for it. I've been breastfeeding for almost nine months now and I work full-time, and the PIS works much better for me."
2,Worked twice,"This pump worked really well the first two times I used it. I washed it, and then couldn't express any milk. It was very frustrating. Also--others have mentioned that their pumps came with extra parts. My pump didn't come with anything--even directions on how to put it together. The lactation consultant had to help me put it together. I'm disappointed with this pump."
1,This is rubbish,"Do not buy this. We bought it, tried to use it, and threw it away. Avent Products contain BPA which is toxic for your baby. Dont poison your child with these toxins. Avent has to re-engineer their products."
3,suction not so good all the time...,The suction is not there. I have found that if you use a smaller bottle (4 oz size) there is not a problem But if I use anything bigger the suction is horible it is very frusterating to use expecially now that I can pump as much a 9 ounces out of one side at a time its a lot of work to stop one forth the way through to empty a bottle so that I have enough room to keep pumping
2,This pump was frustrating,"After having used the Medela pump in style for a few months, I had to return it to the owner I borrowed it from and start using the Avent Isis manual pump I had bought. I would recommend to anyone if they can afford an electric pump to get one. It is more efficient in time it takes to pump and amount of milk it expresses. It is also less awkward. The one advantage of the manual pump: being able to move around while pumping."
3,Buy the Medela,"I found this breast pump very frustrating to use. Had a hard time getting good, reliable suction and therefore a hard time achieving letdown on a regular basis. Some days I would barely get enough milk to cover the bottom of the bottle, and it would make me want to cry. I ended up deciding to get an electric Medela Pump In Style, but on a trip recently I took only the manual pump that comes with it and was amazed at how much better than the Avent it was. It requires a little more elbow grease than the Avent, but the results are well worth it!"
2,It sucks but it won't let go!,"I've heard so many rave reviews that when I lost my Purely Yours, I got this one (my son was not nursing so often by then). I was disappointed. My hand hurt from having to squeeze the pump. I guess I should expect that, given that it's a handheld manual pump. Well, I didn't think it would be that tiring. Both my hands were tied up when pumping both sides. The suction was too much. It would release, so I had to let air in every so often so my nipples wouldn't get sucked into the bottle! Well, it wasn't that bad, but it really wouldn't release. The output wasn't what I'd like, either. Maybe I'm just used to the electric variety. This pump would be okay for light pumping but not for working moms."
2,Worked great at first.....,"I loved this pump when I first bought it about 6 months ago. I do use an electric pump almost everyday at work, but needed something at home and didn't want to shell out $200 on another electric or tote the electric back and forth. This was perfect and easy to use, at first.Now, when I use it, I get about 10 pumps and the little white part that is necessary for creating pressure pops and I have to completely re-install the pieces, while my breasts are leaking. I used to get the equivalent amount of milk my electric pump produced, now I get less than half. I've tried alternating the way I pump (3 pumps, release off the breast, repeat AND 2 pumps, release, repeat AND 1/2 pump for 3 pumps, release, repeat AND others), but the white piece still pops.I haven't contacted Avent yet, but will the next time I get 10 minutes to spare."
3,"Not the best, pass this one over!",I originally bought this because it bears the Avent name and we use the bottle system which we LOVE. I did not have very good luck with this pump. It was extremely hard to get the pump properly placed in order to express any milk. It was cumbersome and I became very frustrated within a short time. I'd try the electronic Isis pump before this particular model.
4,pretty good,"I'm using the Isis pump again for baby #2. I'm a stay-at-home mom so I don't use it too much. I purchased it with my first baby to help relieve the engorgement I had as my milk came in. It's definitely not as fast as an electric pump but it's small and convenient for those on-the-go. It takes some practice to get out more milk, which can be done by changing the position of the pump every so often. (This is not easy to do if you use an electric pump.) When I was engorged with my second baby I spent almost an hour trying to unplug blocked milk ducts, which can be really painful. Using a combination of massaging and angling the pump I was able to pump alot of milk. Another tip when pumping on one breast is to wear an Avent shell on the other breast so that when that breast automatically starts to let down, the milk is not wasted."
2,Good for use AFTER milk supply has been established,The first few weeks of breastfeeding were pretty rough for me. I was convinced that I was starving my baby and unable to get much milk when using this pump. Fortunately I visited a lactation consultant and rented an electric pump for a week. It was amazing how quickly my milk production stabilized after using the electric for awhile. I immediately bought a Medela Pump in Style. The manual pump is good for occasional use now that I've been nursing for the past four months but if you are having problems in the beginning with breastfeeding either rent a hospital pump or get a Medela before thinking about giving up nursing. Don't base your decision on this manual pump.
2,Not worth the money,"I have found this pump to be very frustrating. It will loose the suction if you move the least bit and let down, for me, was practically impossible. Stick with the Medela rental or purchase your own!"
1,Terrible,"My baby was not latching and I had to use a pump. So, after renting the one from the hospital initially, I decided to get one for myself. Lactation consultants suggested this pump. I got it and even after pumping the whole day, I could get only 10cc! It pains a lot too. The only good thing is that you get 2 Avent bottles. Never go for this."
1,Very painful,I didn't want to spend a lot of money since I had heard stories about women who have had trouble nursing. I was better off expressing by hand because this pump hurt me so badly.
1,Don't even waste your time !!!,I chose this breast pump because I wasn't sure if I'd be able to breast feed and didn't see the need in buying an expensive breast pump. Don't even waste your time or money. Not only is the system noisy it is incredibly slow. It took an hour to extract 2 ounces. What a joke !! (...)
2,MY PUMP WAS GOOD UNTIL IT BROKE... :(,I bought this pump about a month ago- and I really did like it. Until it just broke on me!I was just in the middle of pumping - which by the way - I had been pumping for nearly an hour and had almost 4 oz...when the neck of the pump SNAPPED RIGHT IN HALF!!! And i dont been lengthwise. I mean snapped in half as in snapped right off!!! Now I have to dump all of that milk because there is plastice bits in it! :(I rely in pumping to feed my child cuz of many problems- and now Im at a loss...Money is WAY TOO TIGHT to buy another one which is what I have to do now- but you better believe I'm not buying this one again! :(
1,It actually HURTS,"I tried to use this pump when my daughter was ~4 weeks old and it HURT so much that I wanted to cry. Also, it took me 30 minutes to pump ALMOST 2 ounces. At that point, I thought that pumping was just not for me. A few weeks later we bought the Medela Pump in Style and it worked GREAT (I got 6 ounces in 5 minutes) and did not hurt at all! Yes - it is much more expensive, but totally worth it. After using the Medela for a few weeks, I tried this pump again and it still hurt and barely pumped anything. I agree that the suction is just not right. While I do love all of the other products I have from Avent - I really feel that this pump was a waste of money."
5,Great Pump,"I bought this pump for my first child in 2005 and am again using it for my second baby now. This is a really good manual pump for women like me, who do not have to pump too often. It pumps milk very efficiently and is fairly comfortable on the breast. It took me a few tries too get the hang of pumping, but as with riding a bike once you learn how to use it you will not forget."
2,"Works great, when it works","When you can get this very tempermental pump to work, it works great. But I have had the same problem that others have reported; the little membrane/valve thing keeps popping off, thus causing the pump to lose all suction. I have to stop pumping and fish the thing out every 2-3 minutes. I can get just as much milk with this pump as I can with my Medela Pump in Style Advanced, but I don't like having to stop and unscrew it every few minutes. And according to the reviews, I am not the only one with this problem."
2,What's with this squeaking?,"I've had Medela Harmony pump which I thought started loosing suction after 3,5 months of a daily use.My friend highly recommended Avent Isis and I followed her advice.It's not that hard to assemble, though Medela is much easier and have fewer parts. It has a good suction. The only big problem is the terrible noise that comes from rubbing of two pieces of hard plastic against each other.It's true that you have to have substantial ammount of milk to have a good suction with Avent. With Medela it doesn't take too much effort to get the suction but it takes longer to pump then Avent."
4,Best manual pump om the market,"I own 3 pumps - this is the best manual pump. Great when you have to travel and do not have descrete electric outlets handy.Does not have the suction power of my ac pump, but gets the job done.Only downfall are some of the parts are too small to put in dishwasher - easy to loose."
1,Worst product ever,"This thing doesn't work. I've breastfed for 8 months, and used the fabulous Medela at work, but I leave it there because it's too heavy to lug back and forth. I bought the Isis just for the occasional need to pump on weekends. It takes ages to get a drop out, and your hand gets cramped pumping and pumping. A waste of money."
2,Very frustrating,"I have found this pump very frustrating! When I try to use it, I end up having to take it apart about 20 times trying to pump 4 ounces. The small round plastic piece pops out so many times that it makes it an epic task to get 4 oz of breast milk pumped. I'll have to try an electric, or another brand of manual. This is driving me insane."
4,Much better than Medela Harmony,"I originally bought the Medela Harmony (comparable to this pump in style/size/price) and had trouble getting out much milk. Also, the suction stopped working and I had to exchange it. I bought this one only because they were out of the Harmony and it ends up I like this one better! Better construction (much more sturdy; less parts) and I express milk much faster!!"
3,OCCASIONAL USE ONLY,"This is a great pump for travel or here and there pumping. Manual pumping just cannot compare to electric pumping for full-time use. I have the pump in style advanced (which I LOVE - worth every penny). I got this one for travel and it works well, but I don't see how manual pumping can ever beat automatic pumping. It works well enough, but takes some getting used to. The other thing to be weary of is only silicone nipples are available with the Avent system. My son quit silicone nipples after 3 months and the avent system does not have latex. I've since found out that this is fairly common, so if you go with the Avent system, you may end up having to change and this pump does not fit standard size bottles. If you have to choose between this and the Medela, go with Medela! (Make sure to get a new one as I've heard the older ones do not work nearly as well.)"
1,WASTE OF MY MONEY,"After reading so many fabulous reviews, I was suprised I couldn't pump one drop with my isis pump. I bought this when I was pregnant and now I am in the position of actually having to rent a hospital grade pump. Do not buy a pump until your breastfeeding pattern and routine is established and you can ask which pumps are right for you."
4,A great pump for the $,"I have this pump along with the Medela Pump In Style, and I have to say that I like this pump better. I am a stay at home Mom who didn't need to pump throughout the day on a regular basis so the Isis pump was much more suited to my needs. I found it convenient and easy to pump first thing in the morning so that I would have an extra bottle for the baby later in the day when my milk supply seemed to be less. The Isis pump is easy to use, quiet and comfortable.My only complaint would be that there are WAY too many little pieces to assemble the pump and I found it a pain to clean them all and sterilize. One of the pieces also cracked after alot of use, but Avent was great about it and sent me a replacement piece free of charge when I called to let them know about the defect.If you are looking for a pump to use occassionally this is the best bet."
4,Great comfortable pump for its money,"I am a mother of two and wanted to make sure I bought the right pump for me the second time around. The reviews actually help me buy this product and also my husband. My husband convince me to spend the extra cash and get the Isis Pump. I have to say it is a great product, very comfortable and dependable. I do not have to pump much, just a squeeze from my fingertips and the milk express quickly. I love the comfort of the pump; With my first child, I had a very hard time pumping when I went back to work. My arms will get tired and will express very little. Within minutes, the Isis Pump expresses at least 4 oz easily. The product is easy to assemble and clean. Storage bottle are great and can be used immediately with nipples provided. I will definitley suggest to buy this product."
4,Works great but a little unreliable,"This pump works really well as long as you can get suction. There are several pieces that have to be fit together just right in order for it to work, and even then it can take a while. It seems as though when I really need the pump to work (like at 3 in the morning when I'm exhausted, or when my baby is screaming for food) I can't get suction! The culprit is usually the small round star-shaped piece that is not fitted correctly. Sometimes it also helps to get the milk flowing first on it's own. Otherwise, when the suction works, the pump works great and I'm able to get MUCH more milk (and more comfortably) than with my cheap Medela electric pump ($40 version). And it's convenient to be able to pump right into my Avent bottles. For the price, it's a good product."
5,Excellent Pump,"I originally bought this because I like to go against the flow and really didn't want to spend big money on the big name electric [you know the one :)]. Wow!! It works sooo well!! It's quick to use and easy to clean. I can get just as much milk with this one than I can with the electric one my employer provides for use at work. The obvious advantage with other styles is the the ability to pump both sides at once -- but this one is exceptional for use early morning, late night, or while the baby is on the other breast. I would highly recommend this pump -- you don't HAVE to get the big name, big price pump!!!"
5,Great for occasional use,"I love Avent products!! This pump is awesome. Easy to use and to put together. Even my 13 year old has no problem with assembly. I use it on one breast while nursing on the other. I cant do that with my Medela Lactina, which I use less often. I of course get more milk from the electric double pump but this pump cannot be beat for occasional use. Highly recommended!!!"
3,IT WORKED FOR MY FIRST BABY,"I HAD TROUBLE AT FIRST PUMPING WITH THIS PUMP. I REALLY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING IT. I USED IT WITH MY FIRST BABY. THE DIRECTIONS SAID IT WAS DISHWASHER SAFE, BUT WHEN I WENT TO LEND IT TO A FRIEND, I NOTICED WHERE THE VAVLE IS WAS CRACKED LIKE IT HAD ROTTED. I AM NOW LOOKING FOR A MORE EFFIECENT PUMP, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I STAY AT HOME I REALLY DON'T NEED TO BOND WITH MY PUMP, I WOULD RATHER SPEND MY TIME BONDING WITH MY SON AND NEW BABY."
2,Im very frustrated with this pump,"I got this pump as a gift and have pumped with it for 6months. One of the attachment pieces broke in three months and was easily replaced, but just a couple of days ago the neck broke on the pump. I was devastated. Since I couldnt afford a new pump right away, I have had to resort to pumping by hand. This method was very inefficient and I could not make enough milk to sustain my baby while Im at work. I actually had to take off of work until I could get a new pump. Now I worry that my breast may not make enough milk for pumping since I havent pumped in a couple of days. Another problem I have with this pump is it takes forever to pump out a sufficient bottle. I think I am going to try an electric pump because in the end it will probably be worth the extra money."
2,It's slow and noisy,"I have been breast feeding/pumping for 5 1/2 months and was using a double, electric pump. I bought the Isis because of the small size for traveling and because of the good reviews it got.My advice for someone looking to buy it for travel - don't do it. It takes 45+ minutes to express from both sides because it's so slow. The silicone insert is extremely 'squeaky' and extremely annoying. I also felt like I was going to get carpal tunnel in my hands from the pumping action.I also had a very difficult time getting the suction quite right. I wanted to cry when I used it the first couple of times."
1,This was the worst pump I ever bought,"I got home from the hospital and repeatedly tried to get my pump to work but no matter what I did, it would not work correctly. The pump action was so low, it would have taken me forever and a day to fill a bottle. Instead, I preferred to purchase the Medela Electric Doubleease pump. That has been the best pump for me and is well worth the money!"
1,"dO NOT recommend AT ALL, spend money but electrical","I don't know who wrote the other nice review, probably someone who works selling this product but believe me, it is not good at all.yes it is small and compact and the pressure is just as good as an electrical one BUT, there is a white small piece that keeps pupping out of its place. While i am pumping, i have to stop, disesemble the whole thing and put that white piece back into its place. During one pumping, i had to stop at least 4 times. one pumping took over 20 minutes. It was frusterating. I called the 1-800 number and they said they will send me another new design of that white piece but it was 2 weeks before i got it and i gave up pumping. Caused me a lot of head ache. Trust me, it is worth it spend $150 and get something better."
3,B-size beware!,"If you are small-busted, read this! Post-pregnancy, I went from an A-size to a B-size. After 4-5 days, the massaging pad blistered my skin on the areola. After calling Avent and taking a week off, I now use it without the massaging pad. I also went from 2 oz per side to 3-4 oz per side. I am a stay-at-home mom, and pump one side every morning to have some milk on hand. Listen to your Dr and friends and use an electric if going back to work.Also, this is not ""whisper quiet"". The handle sqeaks! Avent even sent me a replacement handle, but no improvement."
1,Didn't work,Bought this with the plan to occassionaly pump so husband could feed. I'd heard great things about Advent. Can't get anything out with it! Went and bought an electronic which was worth paying more for. Would not recommend this pump.
1,the worse breast pump ever,"I tried this breast pump for a month and all i could get out of it was sore nipples and 1/2 oz after an hour of pumping. I tried to return it to babies r us but they wouldn't give me a refund, i tried calling the company and they gave me all kinds of excuses and finally told me they didn't give money back. DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Breaks too easily,"I recieved this pump as a shower gift. After ONE use the bottle attachment part cracked. Since I had to pump a bottle, my husband went & bought another one. After having it only a few weeks, and only a couple of uses, that one too cracked. Now I am stuck with 2 pumps that dont work and am out a lot of money. I at least like the bottles but [$$] for 2 bottles and a paperweight is a little pricey."
1,"Couldn't get it to ""latch""","I got this pump because of the reviews, and i hated it. I had plenty of milk, so that was not the issue. I couldn't get it to latch on to relieve me of engorgement, let alone pump milk to store. I really don't need to pump, so i was told i should get the manual pump. I find it's best to get the electric pumps, like ""pump in style"" by medela. Because I don't pump much at all, i don't want to waste time. If you need to pump often, don't even consider a manual! The medela is so fast and effiecient. i can do both breasts at once to go even faster. 10 minutes is all i need! it's worth the money, especially if you will have other kids. Don't bother with the avent pump!"
5,awesome pump,"This pump is truly amazing. It is so quiet and you can express a lot of milk in a short time. It is hard to believe just by looking at it, but it really does work. I did have a problem with the neck breaking as well, BUT Avent sent me a new one right away. It actually arrived the day after I called. I would hightly recommend this pump if you want to occasionally give your baby expressed milk. It is not for heavy duty use. I"
3,Squeaky and creaky,"This pump is okay. It works, and I can pump out a decent amount of milk just fine, but after one or two uses the pieces started making creaking noises with each squeeze. Really annoying!! They say this is supposed to be quieter than an electric, but it isn't for me. For $50 it shouldn't squeak like this. As another reviewer also pointed out, drops of milk sometimes leak out onto my [breast], and it is just messy in general. This might be a problem with other pumps too though, but I have to wipe myself off each time I switch sides (they recommend 5 minutes on each side, three times)."
3,"works well, but WAY too fragile!","I have been breastfeeding for almost a year and i'm on my fourth isis. It cracks and breaks where the ""horn"" part attaches to the bottle. I've been really careful to follow manufacturer's instructions, too. I emailed the company about it once and they sent me a replacement part, but the other times it broke before I could order a new part and so I had to go out and buy another.The whole reason I keep buying them is because they do work well (I'd give it 4 stars for effectiveness), and I am able to pump much more quickly and discreetly with the isis than with an electric. I pump at work, but it seems like they shouldn't market these to working moms. They don't hold up!"
1,Didn't work,"I had someone buy this for me as a baby shower gift. In the first few days of trying to pump...i was unsuccessful. The pump was annoying...it squeaked and after about an hour of pumping, my hand was tired and had only about an ounce in the container. I then bought a first years electric pump and had 8 ounces in the container after 15 minutes of pumping. Not the best product and now i can't return it because it's been used. Worthless in my eyes."
3,Beware,"Yes I agree that this is a great pump. It works well and is easy to use. I even liked it better than the mini-electric that I tried.One word of advice though- consider it a disposable item. The silicone parts eventually become sticky and discolored from residue. Advent says that this is normal and can be removed by re-boiling. I tried and this did not help much. Replacement parts are expensive. For example, I inquired about a replacement petal massager and was told it would cost $35.00. While the pump can be used without the piece, it is less comfortable. I cannot see paying $35 for a replacement part when the new Medela (also a reputable brand) Harmony pump can be purchased for the same price. In fact, many of the replacement parts for Medela can be purchased off the shelf at Babies R Us.If you are planning on using this pump alot or for more than one child you will spend more than it is worth replacing parts."
1,Didn't work well for me,I bought this pump after reading glowing reviews. I had been using a pump-in-style (my son was premature so I needed the big guns) once he was older I thought I could go to a manual pump it seemed like it would be easier to use for a quick pump before I left him home with dad for a few hours. I really gave it a long trial- two months but really did not find that I could get more than a few ounces out at a time. It was uncomfortable on my breats even pinched and rubbed a blister once. Finally I just gave up on pumping all together. If you are lucky enough to have an electric double pump don't think the grass is greener elsewhere. It wasn't for me.
2,Didn't Like It,I tried to use this pump for a few weeks and had an extremely hard time expressing milk with it. I had plenty of milk but this just didn't pump it out for me. I had to lean over so far to get the proper suction fit that my back was constantly hurting. ... the Isis was a huge waste of money.
1,Nightmare Pump,"I bought the Isis pump because it was recommended to me by the breast feeding specialist at the hospital. My daughter is now 4 months old and my 3rd Isis pump has just cracked and broken. That is 3 pumps in 4 months. The first time it happened, the cracking at the base where the pump and bottle meet, I thought it was our fault. I thought I had maybe dropped it without really realizing it, in all the baby chaos. No, it was not my fault. I treat the pumps very gently, do not even put them in the dishwasher. They all crack and break in the same places. It is a nightmare, because we cannot afford the more expensive pumps, and before the pumps break, they do work very well."
1,VERY disappointing,I tried this pump when we had a power failure. I have a premie and getting breastmilk is crutial for her growth. This pump was of no help at all. It took 20 minutes per side to get a fraction of the milk. I was still full and used my medela pump to alliviate the engorgement that resulted. I decided to invest in the car adaptor as a backup to the Isis. Save youe money and invest in a better brand!
5,Best gift I got,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about this pump! It's awesome and works as well, if not better than, an electrical pump. I used both during the 12 months I breastfed my son, and can say for ease of use and clean-up, this pump far surpasses the electrical Medela pump I borrowed from a friend. The comfort level was excellent, and I could pump as much or more with this than with the Medela. My advice is this...if you're in the market for a hand-held pump, look no further than this one. Go buy it now!"
4,GREAT BUY !!!!!,I LOVE THIS PUMP!!! I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS TO EVERY MOTHER. I USED THIS PUMP WITH MY FIRST CHILD AFTER A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH AND ELECTRIC PUMP. ALTHOUGH I DID HAVE ONE PROBLEM MY DAUGHTER WOULD NOT TAKE TO THE NIPPLE ON THE BOTTLE. SO I HAD TO PUMP IN ONE BOTTLE AND POUR IT IN ANOTHER ONE YEAH IT WAS A PAIN BUT IT WAS WORTH IT. NO MILK SQUIRTING ALL OVER THE PLACE !!!!
2,"Wonderful, Until It Fell Apart","I have been using this pump since I came back to work 6 weeks ago. I use it 2-3 times a day Monday through Friday and I clean it every night. It isn't painful and it pumps quickly. I couldn't have been happier until it fell apart.The actual pump part will no longer stay attached to the bottle. It takes twice as long to pump now because I'm trying to hold it together. I constantly have to stop and try to tighten the top back onto the bottle. Not that it matters, because I usually spill it when the top falls off anyway.I am now in the market for a new pump and I guarantee it won't be an Avent. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this. Please don't make the same mistake I did."
4,Great Choice,"I have been using this pump for almost 5 months now and it still works great. I was scared at first of the thought of attatching this machine to me because all I could think about was the pain it would cause. I have to admit, it did take some time to get used to, but now I love it. It helps the let down reflex go much faster and makes pumping all that much quicker. It is wonderful because you can control how fast or how slow you want to go and how hard the suction is to be. This is a great choice for a pump."
3,great until it broke...,"This is a great pump, but the neck of it broke after only using it for a couple weeks. Maybe it was not meant for heavy-duty use. I read other reviews about this pump and a lot have complained about the neck breaking. I hope babies r us will take it back."
4,WOW,I just bought the Isis pump today and I can't believe it. I wasted money renting a pump for three months. The Isis pumps more and faster than the electric pump. You control the preassure and it cost so much less. I wish that I had tried this pump first. Th only draw back is that it doesn't come with 8oz bottles. Anyone who is thinking of renting a pump or buying the other more expensive electric pump don't waste your money.
2,Okay for occasional pumping,"If you plan to pump regularly, do not bother with this one. Spend the money for the Medella Pump in style. I hardly used my Avent pump and it cracked. It worked okay in the beginning. If you are planning to pump at work, do not rely on this one."
2,Nice,"Its definately the best hand held pump out there, but i still prefer my electric medela one. But this one is easy to take anywheres with you and easy to pump."
5,Best pump on the market,This pump is better than the (...)electric pumps. I tried both of them and the Avent Isis put the others to shame. It is so comfortable and convenient and inexpensive. It's amazing what this little pump can do. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it.
5,I love this pump!!!!,I was having trouble keeping up my milk supply. I have to pump often since my son has acid reflux to add rice to his bottle. this pump has stopped me from giving up breat feeding!! I`m so happy with it! You won`t be displeased.
3,"Okay, but not for frequent pumping at first","I bought this pump because of all the great reviews and because I wasn't planning to use it much. However, first my son wasn't a good nurser and just wouldn't latch on and then he ended up with an infection and was in the hospital for a week after birth. So I had to pump at least to maintain my supply and I turned to this pump. It didn't work at all to stimulate my milk production and I was only getting drops out. I had to buy an electric pump (which still didn't help much--there really is no substitute for a baby's sucking) and ended up not ever using this one. It just didn't do it for me. But I've kept it and will try it again with my next baby because it was comfortable and seemed easy to use."
1,"Not worth the money, time, or effort","I got this pump because it was recommended by a trusted friend. She had very little trouble with it.I did try this pump before I had my son to get the feel for it, for practice, & to try to self-induce labor. It seemed like it would be a great pump, until my milk came in.I keep getting milk sucked up under the petal thing which causes it to lose suction. I even tried everything in the booklet & website to correct this & nothing helps. PLUS, I found out that I could hand-express nearly twice the amount of milk in less than 1/2 the time when I was engorged & the pump was apart to be cleaned.I thought pumps were supposed to save time."
5,Buy this pump before all others!,"I have now nursed two children successfully and highly recommend buying this pump before you buy an electric pump. I experienced a much better letdown and got plenty of milk, even when I was ""drying up"" and he was eating solids. I own an electric pump and rented the hospital one as well, so I really did try the others. I also recommend this pump if you already have an electric one, because you can walk around the house, sit in the car, pump at work and you do not need to plug it in!I was able to pump a big supply before I went to work.Advice: try to pump 4 oz a day to freeze and label while you are still home-at 3 months, then you will have plenty while you get the hang of pumping and working."
3,Hard On The Wrists!!!!,"I loved the convenience of this pump, but I actaully bought an electric pump after using this. After developing pregnancy related carpal tunnel, and still having it, this is definately not the pump to use. I advise anyone who has wrist problems of any sort not to buy a manual breast pump. As for the convenience of this item, it has advantages, too. If you are out somewhere and need to pump, you can do it without everyone knowing what you are doing because it's silent - Electric Pumps are not. It was also very easy to assemble and clean."
4,"A good pump, but fragile","I chose this pump because it had great reviews in baby magazines and is the most natural pump. I used the pump when I went back to work for 6 weeks and it was very nice and discreet and worked well for pumping once during the day. However after using it for 31/2 months now the plastic between the pump body and the bottle adapter broke, rendering the pump useless. I tried to super glue the piece back but it broke again. I like the pump because it was very comfortable and easy to use, but it is very fragile!"
3,Fragile,"I did my homework and read the reviews for different brands. I settled on Advent mainly because of the great reviews. The pumps works great, but it is prone to breaking just above where the bottle is attached. I bought a second pump thinking it was just me over tightenng. However, no matter how carefull I was the second one also broke. It's a good pump, it's just fragile."
2,Don't buy an all purpose pump,You really need to invest in something that's right for you. Not every nipple is the same shape and size. I'd suggest getting a pump that has nipple options and finding your right size that works for you. Don't buy an all purpose pump-it just leads to one frustrated unhappy momma.
1,This pump has a design flaw,The small valve pops up so frequently that it is really not able to finish one session.
5,Handy and efficient,"I was hesitant to buy a hand pump because I'd heard they took forever, but this one has been quite efficient. I've pumped 8 ounces in 15 minutes, which is plenty fast for my purposes (backup storage and a daddy bottle every evening).Since how far you squeeze the handle determines how strong the suction is, you can intuitively adjust the suction throughout your pumping session.The clear pump head is nice because you can see the milk flow. This has probably saved me some discomfort, since I don't squeeze any harder than necessary to get a milk stream.There are a couple of small parts that might tend to get lost, but the pump manufacturer considerately includes a backup of those parts.The bottles that come with this pump are rather small, but the other Avent bottles fit it as well. (I bought two 9-ounce bottles (Philips Avent 9 oz BPA Free Bottle, Dual Pack) for that purpose.)"
3,Best pump I've ever used,"This is my 3rd child and with my other children I used an Evenflo pump, but for some reason it didn't work this time. I purchased this pump. It works great! I didn't think I would like a manuel one but I really do. It makes no noise and it works really well. I would highly recommend this pump."
5,Best pump ever!,I am on my third child and third pump the first two were two different electric brands and this manual pump is absolutely the best! At first I was skeptical because I thought I would get cramps in my hands but I didn't and it turned out great. The electric ones pulls on the breast while this one actually is gentle and actually stimulates the area around the nipple so it does the job better. I am very happy with it and it is worth the cost which isn't bad by the way!
5,On the fence about breastfeeding...,"I was very uncertain as to whether or not I wanted to breastfeed. I gave it a try after being released from the hospital, but my baby and I had to return to the hospital for 3 additional days after we were released. I had to bottle feed while there and I used the hospital grade pump during our stay. I felt awfully close to being a cow! I started using the Avent Isis pump when I returned home with the intent of pumping exclusively and bottle feeding. I was glad to read all this positive feedback because I thought I was just crazy for liking this pump so much more than the hospital grade. I pump about 4-5 ounces in a 10 minute period as well. Let down is immediate and I have no discomfort at all. My friend keeps offering me her Pump In Style and I refuse because I like this pump so much. I'm so glad I can still give my baby breast milk although I choose not to breastfeed and I owe it all to this pump!"
2,Not for Frequent Use,"I purchased this pump when our first baby was born. I didnt think i needed an electric pump and frankly didnt want to spend a fortune on one. It does work well, however i found that after each use you have to take it completely apart and wash all the pieces with care. Also, the more you use it the less effective it is. I ended up pretty frustrated after the first few times. If your planning to use this for weekend outings once or twice a week it will be fine. However if you plan on using it more than that I recomment buying a well known electric pump. I'm buying one for sure this time around. I know that most hospitals will rent out the expensive pumps for a fair price if you dont want to go out and buy one."
1,This pump last no more than 3 weeks.,After 3 weeks neck of the pump breaks. I talked to a lot of people who using this product and everyone of them have same problem.Don't believe me? Try your self
1,Absolutely Awful and Unreliable,"This was a complete waste of $50. There is barely any suction, and what little there is disappears after 2 or 3 pumps. We have washed it, tried using different valves/silicon pieces, and taken it apart and put it back together countless times. It is absolutely awful. I am writing the company a letter and also informing both pregnancy groups I'm in about the problems with this product. Avoid this pump! It is not at all what it is cracked up to be!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this breast pump based on some of the positive feedback, however I was highly dissapointed with it. The main issues I had were: it was extremely painful to operate it and it took forever just to get a couple ounces of milk. I ended up purchasing the Medela Pump In Style and wished I had just bought that from the beginning... yes it is a little more pricy, but it is worth every penny."
1,not happy at all,well I got this pump at my shower and decided to try it.Everytime I tried to pump the handle fell off. So I don't see how this product got such good reveiws unless I got a bad one.
2,Disapointed for the third time,"There is nowhere to put your thumb and I think it adds pressure to the neck. I'm breastfeeding only, but to pump a bottle gives me freedom from one feeding a day & my husband or son usually gives my daughter that pumped bottle. If I were working and had to pump several bottles a day the pump would probably last about two weeks before the neck, the only part there are no extras, breaks. Today the third pump I have purchased has broken. I could've bought an electric by now, but since I do not work I didn't think it would be worth the investment for one bottle a day! My daughter is not even four months old yet. So far it has broken every month with pumping one bottle a day."
1,Useless,The manual avent pump is useless. I took the thing apart a dozen times and reassembled exactly as the directions told me to and was unable to get any more than a tiny amount of suction. I threw the thing out and bought a Medela. The only reason it got one star is because there was no option for zero. Complete waste of money.
1,poor suction,Maybe someone got good suction from this but for me it didn't do squat. I ended up going out and getting the Ameda purley yours electric pump. It is adjustable with speed and suction plus it was only $150. NOt bad for a double pump.
2,read the negative reviews first,"I can't believe all the great reviews. Maybe its just me, but I think this pump is so overrated. The pluses: it is small, it does work OK sometimes. The negatives: it takes a long time to pump even a small amount, it has a lot of parts.And the worst one is that the plastic star valve keeps coming off, which requires taking it apart in the middle of pumping,while its leaking everywhere. I rented the Medela for 2 months before using it and believe me this thing does not compare, not even close. I use it only occasionally and it drives me crazy even than. There has to be a better hand pump out there. This is my personal opinion, so your resluts could be totally different"
1,ThirstyMind,"I have purchsed a TomTom One XL recently. It is one of the worst electronics purchase I have ever made. The windshield mount from TomTom is a horrible product. Several years back I puchased GPS of some unknown brand. I used it continuously for two weeks and travelled around 3000 miles. The mount was rock-solid and never had any problem. With this suppossed to be brand name GPS, the mount along with the GPS unit fell off six time during a ride of half an hour. So beware of this product. Since there is no rating of less than one star, I am forced to give it. Otherwise I would have given it zero. Their support sucks. It is not 24/7. They are closed on Sundays, and open only certain hours on other days."
1,Stay away from Tom Tom,"If you want a good product stay away from Tom Tom products. I have used 3 different products from tom tom and maybe I'm a slow learner or tom tom has bad products, just stay away from tom tom so many better gps units to buy that are better"
1,A WAIST OF TIME AND MONNEY,"It barely worked for 1 month, and then turned to a nightmare. The whole unit ended on the side of the Florida turnpike.Stay away from it!!!"
2,Bluetooth,"Wanted a 4.3 inch bluetooth GPS with maps of U.S. and Canada. This unit seemed like a perfect fit for an price that could not be beat. But alas, you get what you pay for. The bluetooth function does not support hands free talking on your cell phone. For that you need a ""TomTom Go"" product (or another brand). I returned the unit. Returns with Amazon are easy so though I was disappointed with my purchase, I was happy with my Amazon experience."
1,Unit Severely Short On Memory,"This GPS unit is out of memory out of the box! I won't dispute any of what was said above, but be aware that all the voice options, all the help, all the frills that come loaded on your XL when you pull it out of the package take up so much memory that you can't update you maps with them on the unit. They must be sacrificed in order to download and install any up-to-date maps. This was a great big deal breaker for me... my unit TomTom XL 330s went straight back to the store. The pity is that TomTom knows this and refuses to acknowledge their design flaw. Don't buy this unit."
5,Good GPS for the $$$,"I bought 2 of these when it was the Gold Box Deal of the Day @ $99 each. You can't beat that price! I would have purchased 1 more but Amazon restricted it to 2. Anyway, locks into satellites quickly. Easy to use. I played around w/ it and pretty user friendly even for me. These were gifts and they were a big hit! My brother in law loves it and my nephew does too! Both were hit! Needless to say they are still talking about it! Here's just a hint: All GPS devices have there pros and cons, from the ecomony ones to the most expensive ones regardless of the brand. So, keep this in mind!"
4,fleet purchase,This is the last of several types of gps units purchased for both delivery and service vehicle personel and this unit seems to be the favorite bsed on total performance and ease of use along with options that seem to be most usefull for a variety of my drivers. overall very happy with this purchase.
1,Returned our tom tom,"We have returned our tom tom DVD as it did not give good directions. On a road which we were extremely familiar with, it directed us to an exit two days in a row which we knew to be incorrect. Also, it did not call out the names of the street to turn on. Sometimes turns were very close together and questionable if we ""just"" depended upon the direction given."
4,Good Product,"This is a great product. It has a big screen and is easy to use. It's very easy to follow the directions and very easy to input addresses. Sometimes I don't always agree with the route it gives if I know where I am going, but other than that I would defintely recommend this GPS."
3,No Points of Interest,"The hardware of the machine is good. Easy to use and read the touchscreen and all; the only problem is it hardly has any points of interest stored. It doesn't have Safeway, Longs/CVS, Walmart. Which means you have to find out the street address of anywhere you want to go. Weak"
2,Tom Tom ONE XL 4.3-Inch Widescreen,"I was sorry I made this purchase; I drive trucks cross-country the product is designed for automobiles not commercial use; it does not offer the option for gross weight and height restrictions in programming its route. Nor does it allow you to tell it your desired route. The unit was defective, I had to send it back, the vendor replaced the original unit, the second units software gave me trouble the vendors limited assistance didn't resolve the problems. I wanted to return it and be refunded at least the purchase price but the vendor wanted to charge me even though the product was defective from the inception of the purchase. I decided I'd rather loose the entire purchase price than continue to be frustrated dealing with the vendor."
1,Lemon,"This product is a lemon. The map couldn't find my place, which is located in the heart of Buckhead, Atlanta, the most central place in the city, cross of two major roads. Customer support recommended me upgrading the map, which I did, and it still did not find my place. I returned it and replaced with a $6 old-fashioned map."
4,"Great Value, Easy to use","This is my first GPS unit, and I am VERY pleased. I was very close to giving it 5 stars, but a couple of the directions have not been the fastest route. In the ONE XL's defense, each time the directions were not the best, it was because it took the long way around a somewhat new connector road. Route recalculation is very fast if you make a wrong turn. It is easy enough to see and I have not had any glare issues in the bright sunlight. It has everything I wanted and none of the overkill gadgets that make some of the other units on the market too cumbersome. For the price of the ONE XL, you won't find a better GPS.Update: Battery performance has not been the best on this unit. I have to keep it plugged in while in use. Also, satellite signals are not acquired as quickly as I would like. It's been nearly 2 years since I purchased this unit, so I'm sure there is better technology out there now. I do still like this one because it is basic and simple to use."
2,Stop Me Before I Throw It Through The Window,"Very frustrating to use. Doesn't like to connect to the computer on the first try. The software that allows you to operate it via the computer won't always launch. The unit sometimes has a hiccup and won't respond to a touch command, so when it wakes up after the second or third try, it does the command...you got it, three times. I bought it for the larger screen. But overall, it has not been an enjoyable thing to use. UPDATE: I gave up and threw it out. By this time, I didn't want to exchange it for the second time. I'm washing my hands of TomTom."
1,Item defective,"This TomTom came loaded with a map of Guam! Although several computer savvy people tried for hours to load maps of the U.S., we were never able to do so. I had to return the product."
3,"Nice features, lack of POI","The TomTom had many great features such as phone numbers with the POI, however it would not pull up some key POI that I needed. The fire department that I work for wasn't on there under the fire stations category. The routes are longer on the TomTom than the Garmin I used next. I plotted a trip to AZ from MI, and the Garmin had it almost 5 hours shorter."
3,"Its OK, but Im going to sell it for a Garmin, not happy with the map database","I had a Garmin 200, and sold it to get this. I want my Nuvi back, it was easier to get started with, easier to find locations, and was more correct, though I have the latest map. I like the 4.3 "" screen, but now realize the features, and street names is a better feature, since I really dont look at it once im driving."
2,Beware - broke after a year,"After a little over a year the unit broke. It reboots every time I turn off the engine. After rebooting it cannot find GPS signal. Sometimes instead of rebooting it just hangs on the white and black screen, and I'm not able to turn it off at all. I suspect the problem is with the battery.A few months earlier, it started giving me signs of warning by not finding GPS for a long time after being turned on.I paid about $250 for it a year ago, it is a high price tag for a year of usage! This time I'm going with Garmin which has a better reputation for reliablity."
1,Pain in the neck!,Product would only find maybe 1 out of 5 addresses. I spent 2 hours on the phone with support and still no luck. I returned the item and bought a Garmin.
3,"Gets you around, many problems","The problems:(1) Even after updates it's points of interests are very thin(2) Takes a long time to start up and find satellite signal(3) Finiky when it hasn't been used in a while(4) I think they expect you to take this unit inside with you, but give me a break - how about designing something that can withstand the heat/cold inherent to the interior of a car.Other than that, this unit still works after many years of service, so I can't complain too much."
4,TomTom works WAY better than Tom,"I've had my TomTom now for almost a year. I am legally named ""Tom,"" and I can safely say TomTom has gotten us lost a lot less than ""Tom."" The touchscreen is quite responsive, and the menus are easy to navigate. I'd rate it a perfect five stars, but I lose the signal quite a bit when I'm in a city, and the battery dies quickly if it's not plugged in. It also takes a pretty long time to find satellites when it starts up - sometimes I have to turn it off and then on again in order for it to pick up a signal. Overall, it's a reasonably priced necessity, in my opinion."
4,Functional,"The product is extremely functional. While it doesn't have all of the bells and whistles it's a great value. If you are looking for a device that functions as a capable GPS device then this one is for you. Don't expect anything fancy, just the basics. I needed a second device for when I travel and use a rental car. This product works!!"
5,More than pleased..,"I was initially concerned that the great price for the XL was due to TomTom's prepping for a new product rollout...however, upon reading the specs for the XL, I was satisfied that this release was pretty current. This was a gift for my son, who lives in upstate NY and he thinks it's a great product - and gets a kick about the extra features. Obviously, the expanded screen and TomTom's rep was the key to this purchase - and you can't go wrong with the price."
4,Excellent Unit,I have used this unit on two long trips so far and it has accurately gotten me out of airport congestion on both occasions. I am very pleased with the XL and would recommend it to anyone who wants a basic unit without useless additional frills.
3,Great GPS but...,"DO NOT update the software. TomTom still has not addressed the problem of using the 'home' software to update the GPS. If you do this, even if you made a back up, the GPS will be an expensive paperweight that flashes a big red X. (This is as of 8 November 07)"
1,Tom Tom,this product lasted LESS than a year and we could not get it fixed!! Had to purchase an entirely new one!! Not happy about this one at all.
3,"Ok, but the maps are too often inaccurate.","I purchased this over a year ago because it was relatively cheap and a TomTom (probably the biggest name in GPS today). After a few times of usage, I found the One XL to be mediocre at best. Even with the updates downloaded online, I found the maps that were used would over/under shoot my destination by as much as a mile. In fairness, this is not ALL the time, but it is sadly about 50% of the time, which is extraordinarily horrible for a GPS unit that you often rely on blindly. I gave the One XL 3 stars because it gets me in the vicinity of where I want to go to the point where I can find my destination myself, otherwise I would've given this product 1 star."
4,TomTom,My husband bought me one for Christmas and I love it. For our anniversary he wanted a Garmin. Two days after use he returned the Garmin because it was not as easy to use as the TomTom. So I ordered him one just like mine.
5,GREAT,"This product is great! It gets me wherever I want! Though, some problems on streets surrounded by tall buildings, caused by problems tracking the GPS-sattelites. But this is a minor issue!"
4,TomTom ONE XL,"I bought this last week and it works great. All but once it found satellites within a few minutes. Most of the time it was read to go before I was.I chose this over a Garmen Nuvi, in the same price bracket, because you can back up favorite destinations and set up an itinerary. I don't know about the backup feature but the similar Nuvi would only allow point to point navigation.It was a tough choice - other users felt that the Garmin had better maps plus it ""says"" the street name you are approaching which is available on the TomTom oneXL S not mine.I'll be using this for sales calls so the itinerary feature was the real selling point and you can load 48 favorites into it.I was given a Cobra for Christmas but took it back because you can't back anything up and you lose any data when you upgrade the maps.So far this has done everything I expected & more. It tried to lead me down a one-way street the wrong way, but I found out later that it was set for walking - not driving mode!"
4,1,"Time calculations and traffic calculations are very inaccurate, but if you just need it for wrong turns and unfamiliar areas, it's big screan is easy to refer to when driving."
2,Getting lost with a GPS,"This TomTom One XL is my first vehicle GPS. It does not recognize the street we live on. So far, I have tried to use it to navigate to 2 different locations and the recommended routes made no sense at all. The last time I used it, the suggested route added 15 miles to what should be an 8 mile trip. We plan to return it after only 3 days."
3,TomTom XL,I really like the TomTom XL over other units that I have purchased.TomTom ONE 3rd Edition 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Vehicle Navigator
3,TomTom One XL,"Good unit for the price. On more than one occasion the unit could not find addresses so I used street intersection instead. Compared to the Nuvi 660, which I also use, it lacks text to speach and screen not as clear. Constant repetion of directions at every exit is very annoying.I will still recommend it becuase it is $300 less than the above Nuvi 660."
2,"good unit, bad customer service","I never buy used electronics because I was customer service when something goes wrong. I should start with the actual unit description and say that I do use the unit and am impressed with its functionality. Very fast routing, almost never loose connection to sats. Overall, pleased with the unit. Could not for the life of me connect it via bluetooth to my cell phone for traffic stuff.My beef with Tomtom is after approximately two months of having it the power cord went out. Contacted Amazon who said contact tomtom, who said return it or provide with upc on box, proof of purchase, and some other things I don't remember and they would replace cord if I paid for shipping. That tweeked me off enough that I won't buy again from tomtom. I just went to radio shack and replaced cord for thirty-five bucks myself, but very difficult to contact tomtom and then to get no support, too many other good alternatives for other gps units with support in my book."
3,No STARBUCKS coffee from TomTom,"I have been shopping for a GPS for my wife's Birthay. We do a great deal of traveling in unfamiliar places and we spend a fair amount of time looking for a decent 24 oz iced skinny latte. I typed in ""coffee"" from chino CA Staples gps display and found plenty of results but no Starbucks. Then I typed in ""Starbucks"" and got no results even though there are 3 within 10 blocks. I was going to buy the TomTom but decided to keep looking. I know first hand how loyal some coffee drinkers can be. I am sure this will not be a big consideration for most but it may be critical to some."
1,Don't update it unless you live in Guam.,"Got mine as a gift and after using it once, I decided to use the map update feature. It wiped out all of my USA and Canada maps and installed Guam. Customer service was a hastle since they wouldn't help me until I faxed a copy of my receipt which I didn't have. Since I had to go the trouble of getting the receipt, I figured it was easier just to return the piece of junk."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I wouldn't buy another TomTom. The company only provides a 14-day warranty against defects and failure. When I contacted them within one month of ownership, they basically told me ""tough luck"".I would switch to a company that prides themselves in the quality of their products."
2,Useless ETA,"The ETA feature is useless. You can NOT set the speed limits on roads, they assume that 50mph is good enough. I called tech support and was told that there was no fix for the problem but ""the ETA gets more accurate the closer you get to your destination""....duhhhhhhh. I have since returned it and bought a Garmin Nuvi 750."
5,Tomtom One XL,Product is easy to use and to follow. I have had other GPS systems and this one beats them all. Would highly recommend.
3,Ok Ok Tom Tom,"I took this one after I had used a same version for a week from my friend.Pros :Big Screen, touch screen, easy to use menu...Cons :Once I select ""Avoid Highways"", it still shows me a highway on the list. I don't know why?, I have updated maps....Battery is weak, once fully charged, it will work for abt 1.5 hrs. not sure though if its normal.Bluetooth technology is not fully utilised to connect to phone for calls..."
4,"Solid, not spectacular GPS unit","I was just in LA visiting family over Christmas, which gave me a good opportunity to test out my new toy - purchased through the Gold Box deal for $99.The unit got me everywhere I wanted to go, with minimal problems - the only issue I ran into several times was the maps not realizing that I couldn't make a left turn because of an island in the road, leading to a few unexpected U-turns.The voice directions are clear, the visual maps are easy to follow and it's very simple to get up and running, punch in an address, etc. I've had better GPS devices in rental cars, but for this price I doubt you could do much better."
4,Serves its purpose!,Serves its purpose and priced just right as compared to other gps units. I like it and created no problmes for me.
1,Bob's review of TomTom One XL,"Disappointed with the bluetooth functionality - wouldn't set up, very disappointed with the maps, they are way out of date. My home isn't on even the updated map I downloaded and my home and subdivision were built in 2003, more than five years ago. Tried to download the 'free' map update and it said it wasn't available. Not good service. Filed several complaints and the company never responded. If I could I would get my money back. Uggghh!"
5,TomTom ONE XL,"Purchased this 5 months ago to replace an older Garmin 350. Map update for the Garmin was too pricey. The TomTom is an excellent gps. You are allowed one free update for newest map coverage which I did. I live down in New Orleans and there has not been any problems with locating streets in the 150 mile radius that I travel to back and forth. Speaker volume, brightness, and satellite aquisitions are very adequate. You can do map updates from TomTom for $10 each quarter if you want to. That is a good feature since things are changing fairly quickly with new subdivisions, etc. and it's done 4 times during the year. This is cheaper than Garmin's charges. The only drawback is that this unit does not tell you the street names, it just says to turn in 300 ft. or 500 yards depending on what speed you are traveling."
5,great gps,After buying and trying this for a couple of weeks now I really like it. I ordered it to put in a new ford lariet I was going to buy but by the time it came I had bought the King Ranch that has gps built in. I just use this in my work truck and it has performed great.
2,NICE WHILE IT LASTED,I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loved it-- but just called me last night and said it won't turn on or anything anymore- and it's past the refund date... he has had it for 2 and a half months...not happy!
3,Average.,"Bluetooth functionality is very limited to only certain phone providers. Very misleading:( But at it's price, I'm not totally disappointed."
1,Don't buy this GPS,"Hi I purchased the tomtom One XL about 1 year ago. I live in the US and travel to Europe a lot so I need one that would contain USA and Europe maps.I purchased it with the USA maps and paid to down load the Europe maps.The First Thing was it would not recognise any SD card I put in it, Sandisk, Lexar.It will only hold 1 map on the internal memory so if i wanted to put the Europe maps on I would have to take the USA maps off. Then changed them back on my return. It seems you lose all your waypoints when you do this.Then in November 2010 I removed the Europe maps and couldn't get the USA map back on...after numerous calls and emails to tomtom I have given up. tomtom's phone support often keeps you holding on for a long time before your call is answered, and as loading the maps can take an hour you call can take 1.5 hours or more!There email support have never been able to resolve the problem. I've given up and BOUGHT A GARMINhere are my thought on the tomtom on video[...]"
1,TomTom ONE XL 4.3-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator,"This product is like a Apple product. It has lots of cool features, and it is easy to use. However it breaks easy and there is no way to self repair. For example once the screen goes out of alignment the product is useless unless you send it in for repair $$$!"
2,Poor support from TomTom,"Although the TomTom One XL does what it is supposed to, do not look for any technical support from TomTom. Their support agents are either completely unfamiliar with this product, or are extremely rude and condesending. In one call I can say that I have never been treated in such a rude and unprofessional manner. The printed instructions that come with it say next to nothing in different languages. My rating of this product is of my whole experience with it, and that includes the quality of the instructions and technical support both of which are appallingly poor. Think twice before buying this or any other TomTom product.Tom Tom ONE XL Portable Extra-wide Screen GPS Navigation System"
3,Business Owner,"Having used a Garmin Street Pilot from a car rental agency and observed my son's Acura TSX unit (Alpine), I am disappointed in the TomTom ONE XL unit. While others announce the name of the next street/ave/freeway that you will be turning on, the TomTom does not. Here in the Seattle area it has frequently been confused and offered bad directions, once instructing me to turn left into a swamp. The English names for roads is ""interesting"". Rather than refering to freeways/expressways, the term used is ""motorways"". Similarly, rather than round-abouts it says rotaries. Oh well... Finally, the menu structure is not always intuitive, rather, quite the opposite.I now have it and guess I'll have to live with it. Wish I'd bought a Garmin!"
3,Tom Tom One XL GPS Navigator,"The unit is easy to view and performs wel. I had a problem in that the car charger could not bring the unit up to full charge and I contacted factory to find that the unit must be charged initially via the computer and that the car charger only charges it a small amount.The unit kept routing me through NY city on a trip from NJ to Vermont and I didn't care to go this way but there was no way to change it's mind because this was the shortest if not the fastest route.Also there was a time or two where it called for a turn where there was no street, but on the whole I am happy with the product.l"
2,Tom Tom One XL 4.3 inch Screen,Unit worked when opened. A few days later the program froze and could not be reset even with the reset button hidden by the SD slot. I bought it for a trip and did not have use of the unit for the trip because of the defect. I had to incur the extra expense of shipping the unit back to the factory. Tom Tom should have taken care of that. I will probably not buy from them again.
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This was my THIRD gps and I was really hoping for something good for a change. I had tried a Polaroid (mostly because it doubled as a DVD player), the maps were so outdated and they had no intention of updating them. Then I tried a Magellan Maestro 4210, which was decent but it had a screen defect so I returned it. Lastly, I thought I'd try a TomTom since they claim to have maps no older than 30 days. WRONG!! It didn't even have my neighborhood school (which has been there at least 4 years), nor one of the biggest hotel/casinos in Vegas in the POIs. The ringer was when it gave me bad directions on more than one occasion. It would tell me to turn one way, when I could clearly see my destination was down the street the OTHER way!When I contacted TomTom about these missing POIs and wrong directions, their best answer was that I was ""welcome"" to go into their mapshare and correct or add these points. For me, that just defeats the purpose of having a gps.No thanks."
1,No TomTom for me,I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts for my adult kids. My daughter updated hers using the disk that came with the unit. From then on it only showed a map of Guam. After 30 minutes on the phone with customer service (still not working) the agent told her he had to go and hung up on her. I am returning both of them and will never buy another TomTom product. I ordered 2 Garmin's to replace them.
2,Tom Tom,I must say I am disappointed with the mount for the GPS. I had difficulty keeping it on my windshield. It fell off 3 times during a 1.5 hour trip. If I missed a turn it would tell me to turn around. My daughter has a Garmin and the mount is much nicer. The Garmin also recalculates the route if you miss a turn. The Garmin seems more user friendly than the Tom Tom. If I were to recommend one to a fried I would definitely recommend a Garmin.
3,TomTom XL,"A disappointing purchase. If you don't know anything at all about traveling, the TomTom will get you where you want to go. But if you are familiar with most of your travels and want to ""plan"" your trips, the TomTom isn't very ""user friendly"" for changing routes . . . though it's not impossible to do so. I assume the higher quality GPS systems are better?"
4,TomTom One XL,I like the GPS it has all the features the I wanted but I tested it many times in areas by my house (places I know) and it doesn't always give the best directions. There are a couple of places when it tells me to turn right and make u-turns instead of just telling me to turn left.
4,TOMTOM ONE XL,I had a lot of problems at startup and it took a lot of time with tech support to correct. now it works great.
4,TomTom,"I brought this item for my wife and she is very happy with it. She takes it everywhere she goes. It is easy to operate, automatically recalculates directions if you miss the turn offs and she enjoys the varety of voices that she can choose to get her directions. She was also able to get a update for the maps along with additional voice options. This our first GPS so we don't have a lot to compare it with."
5,Wonderful!,We researched many GPS's and this one for the money seemed to be the one. We love it and it's just wonderful. The screen has great color and resolution...good size. We would highly recommend this TomTom.
3,new purchase onexl,"The item was listed as new. The price I paid for it should have been new. When we contacted TomTom to do the update, they informed us the unit was a refurbished unit. . , , ,"
4,Very good GPS,"Unlike the terrible Garmin units I've owned, this one boots up and locates satellites very quickly. It has the usual glitches here and there (i.e. odd routing to your destination), but the darn thing works. The biggest complaint I had with all my Garmins was excessive boot up time and taking several minutes to find satellites. The XL One has no such problems. Battery life is acceptable, and the software lets you customize it with your own pics for the opening and closing splash screens, which is kinda cool. Great unit for the price!"
3,Refurbished was a mistake,"The times I did use this were great, it took me on some unnamed Forest Service roads geocaching from one lake to another without me having a clue how to get there. Took me downstate to where my son was staying with no problem. We named her Lola and just enjoyed traveling with her the few times we used her. Saying that, we did only use this a few times before it simply died. I loved everything about this GPS but would not buy a refurbished one again. I thought they were supposed to be as good as new but after using it probably less than 10 times it just won't turn on anymore."
2,Not all that it seems to be,"After receiving the Tom Tom GPA I was disapointed to find out that it was now all that it was advertised to be. The ad states that it is bluetooth capable, but the bluetooth can only be used to talk to Tom Tom HQ for updates. It cannot be used to make hands free phone calls. If I would have known that before I ordered the GPS I would not have ordered it. I can not give the TomTom a complete review because I returned it the next day. It was not what I was looking for."
4,Works wonderfully!,"I shopped around quite a bit before settling on this gps. I've found it to be 1) easy to use 2) well-designed and 3) fun to work with. For the not so tech savvy, this is a great choice.erika"
2,Not a good buy,"Will it get you where you need to go? Yes. However, it will take you on the most meandering, round-about route through all the side streets in town before it gets you there. I tested it to see what directions it would give to get me to work (which would normally be five turns, tops, from where I was sitting), and it gave me about 8 different turns, sent me on a two-mile crawl down a side street (which ran parallel to a major street just a block away), and then, as I came upon my office, didn't tell me to stop until I had crossed the street and driven in front of the building next to my office's building.My mom has a Magellan, and using her Magellan is why I wanted a GPS to begin with. The TomTom is going back, and I'll be getting a Magellan instead."
5,Awesome GPS,"How could I have survived without it? It shows me routes that I never knew existed, establishes routes very quickly, and is very easy to use. The screen is nice and big, touch screen is responsive, POI are numerous and helpful. Would recommend anyone this product."
4,TomTom One XL - not quite 5 stars,"Just bought it and used it in areas unknown to me - both on the interstate and in the boonies.The spoken directions were not clear EXACTLY where to exit - sometimes saying ""Exit ahead ""- but not ""Exit Here"". Sometimes it becamme clear that ""ahead"" meant the next exit and sometimes it didn't. That was really frustrating.In the boonies - it actually was better and clearer what the prompt meant.Not sure if the extra 1/2 inch of screen was worth the extra $100."
4,Nice but could be better,"This is my first TomTom product. I had been a Garmin user in the past. First things, the product has very nice graphics, set up is relatively easy, and the portability makes it very convenient. In general I think I received my money's worth. The items where it lacks: whereas I purchaed the extra wide screen thinking I would get a larger field of view for maps the fact that the information section on the bottom of the screen takes up 20% of the screen is a big drawback, the sofware should make this section transparant. Nect item is the screen indicates points of interest but there is no way to select them on screen, and finally the map browser is not intuitive. Summary, the item is nice but improvements in software could make this much better."
4,Tom Tom One XL,"I really like the product. The only thing I found wrong is that when I wentto register it online, and get the free online first time map update is that it wouldn't go through and it didn't work. I also found that when I tried to download a voice to the Tom Tom that didn't work either. I haven't had the time to mess with it online and figure out why those features weren't working.The Tom Tom itself is awesome. I have had a fair amount of practice withit, and it works very well. My only concern is when I try to update maps,etc. online that I don't know if I will be able to activate them directlyon the Tom Tom."
4,Tom Tom XL,"I purchase the Tom Tom XL after seeing my sisters Garmin. I decided on the Tom Tom XL because of the price. It was half of the cost of the Garmin. I really like my Tom Tom. It does a good job and I think they are making upgrades all the time. I do not think it is a user friendly as the Gamin Nuvi nor does it have the points of interest that the Garmin has. If they ever get all the points of interest and show the addresses and phone numbers then I think it would be great. Those are the only things I wish it had. For the money, if you just want to put in a address it will get you there and I do think that they are making upgrades all the time. So over all I am Happy with my Tom Tom xl and for the money I dont think I could beat it.Happy Tom Tom owner"
1,Guam ? I dont want maps of Guam,"[[ASIN:B000PCBVA6 TomTom ONE XL 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Maps of the U.S. and CanadaCame with old maps. Tried to download new ones, spent 2 hours on the phone twice. First time ended up with Guam only. Second time ended up with ""no maps found"". Maybe its just me, but I would look at other GPS's."
5,Solid overview of America's first commander-in-chief.......,"Because this book focuses exclusively on Washington's presidency, it avoids the trappings of postmodernist social history and instead gives us a portrait of power. More than a mere dupe of Hamilton, Washington is presented instead as a symbol of dignity; firm, intelligent, and focused. While the author makes it clear that Washington was far from the man of marble so often portrayed in grade school history books, he was nonetheless a man of true principle -- especially in terms of Federalist philosophy. Modern readers should take note of Washington's belief in a strong central government and a distrust of states' rights and factions. Also, the author rightly places his Farewell Address in the pantheon of great American documents -- a collection of remarkably prescient prose arguably as influential as anything ever written by Jefferson or Lincoln."
4,Washington the true Father of the Country,"This book concentrates on Washington's administration. It gave me a new appreciation for how instrumental he was in building the nation--not just freeing a collection of thirteen states from Britain.Except for what I felt was the author's ponderous style, this is a great book."
5,Patriarch,"Smith provides a superb chronology of Washington's presidency. We're guided through national issues including the formation of the federal government, building the ""character"" of the President, Indian diplomacy, the Whiskey Rebellion, and the planning and development of Washington D.C. Foreign diplomacy with France, Britain, and Spain is a constant theme. The Jay Treaty and neutrality during France's civil war are expounded upon. And, peppered in are Washington's personal qualms with farming, property, family, and finances. The author recreates Washington's tumultuous eight years as Executive in a concise and fluid biography. By focusing strictly on his presidency, Smith is able to delve into the events that shaped early America with a level of detail that a traditional biography cannot. In reading this book, one can understand the importance of the outcome of each issue/event and the significance of Washington's decisions concerning the precedence set by his actions."
2,Good idea,"So I've been searching and searching for a good neck rest for my salon Shampoo bowls, and unfortunately I'm still going to have to continue the search. This is a good idea, but not good construction. It tears and does not stay in place, the suction cups rip right out...so sad!!"
4,Works Pretty Well.. Temperature Gauge is waaaay off,"If you try to set it up to turn on when it gets X degrees..... It will say its 85F (when its running) when its 72 in the room... It will cool down to normal temp and start over againThat doesn't work all that great, but its the 5th one I tried and the one I stuck with"
2,temperature gauge is way off,"good heat output but the temperature gauge is way off. i bought the unit bc of the digital thermostat. does not work well at all. i had tried a LASKO ceramic heater and the two units just quit on me in one month each so i went to honeywell. well , i will be still searching !!!"
2,Thermostat doesn't work,"I am convinced they never tested this product's thermostat feature even once.Puts out lot of heat, best heater in the class. But how do you name a product 'SURE SET' if that's the feature that does not work?"
5,Notre Dame fans get ready for some interesting facts,My son just loves ND basketball and asked for this book to be his night time reading. I obliged and while doing the reading found that I was learning plenty myself.
2,Somewhat disappointing,Not having direct access to Digger Phelps makes this book somewhat incomplete in my opinion. Some of the early history is quite interesting.
5,Worth buying!,"This book contains amazing & informative images (>400), each of which has its explanatory note. This makes the process of learning more ""enjoyable"" as it also facilitates the recognition of classical physical signs. The book is divided into: (Head & Neck) (Hands, arms, & axillae) (Chest, abdomen & genitalia) (Legs & feet) (Skin) and (Eyes)."
5,The Reconnection...pure brilliance,"The author is consice, clear and thought provoking. Humour is used to bridge the gap between man and god. The teachings are a superb manifestation of god in action. Eric Pearl has provided a simple yet effective modality for self transformation. A must read."
5,The Reconnection,"This book is excellent. For those on the spiritual path (journey) this is a must read. On the spiritual path other books of interest are The Book of Love by Karen Anne Bentley, The Dissapearance of the Universe by Gary Renard, and Dr. Wayne Dyer's most recent books , I especially was helped by his books: You'll See It When You Believe It, and Manifest Your Destiny, also go on the following website [...] and read the life of Lester Levenson."
5,The Reconnection,"After a few pages, I knew I was hooked. Dr. Pearl has a very personable style, and once I started, I could not put the bool down until I was finished. The words seemed to have struck a chord within, and I plan to attend his workshops when I can."
3,The Reconnection,"This book was advertised as ""like new"". The outside fits the description but the minute I opened the book it was filled with writing, underlined items plus what had to be scribbling from a child. It will most likely still work for my purposes (might be nice to see what someone else felt was important) but I probably wouldn't have advertised it as ""like new""."
4,Books with marks in them a pet peeve,"This book was listed as in good condition and it was not ragged, however it is marked in. For the price I'll deal with it but I do not like books that have been highlighted, marked in or pages turned down. Would rather spend the money on a newer book. Don't know if there is a way for the seller to put that info. I do not hold any grudges against seller because it is TRUE, book is in good condition."
5,Must Read...,"if you are into new age, new energy, healing, Kryon etc. You can discover some wonderful things about yourself and the world. Also some nice explanations of all the new age philosophy and works (frequency, vibrations etc.)Recommended for anyone!Muso"
4,worth the money,"need to read it a couple of time and practice - I can't say it works as of yet, worth the try."
5,A useful healing method!,"This method of Energetic Healing is simple and effective. It is uncomplicated, doesn't have specific ""rules"" that have to be followed in order to get results. Depends on an individual's perception and sensitivity to the energy fields. I was impressed and recommend this method to others. Thanks, Eric"
5,Interesting reading,"I found The Reconnection very interesting. The premise of being able to heal yourself and others with your mind, by your thoughts is ancient. Nothing new there. However Eric Pearl puts a slightly different spin on the matter. He has a way of putting his ideas, and experiences in healing in an easy to understand format. Coming at the issue from the frequency standpoint, along with the knowledge that our frequencies are in a mode of change at the present, he casts a whole new light on the matter. Anyone interested in transpersonal healing will find this book inspirational."
5,"A scary read, but a good one...","I desired to be a natural healer. I never understood the Reiki stuff with all the symbols. However, this is beyond reiki, symbols, years of study and atonement's. You will start feeling the healing frequencies instantly just from reading the book. It's kinda freaky. I have helped people from breathing problems all the way to helping people with erectile dysfunction. Bottom line: it works. The author also offers certification classes. You want need to be certified. Why? You will automatically become certain. And those you perform a healing on will know it right away!"
3,The Reconnection by Dr. Eric Pearl,"Dr. Pearl recommends that you read the book three times. I have only read it twice. It was an okay book on healing. However, the doctor seems really full of himself and that made me think that the book was more about him and his accomplishments rather than healing. I also checked his online pages showing places where he might be presenting his technique seminars. I found that most of his seminars were overseas and the only one that was shown in the States was in Florida, some 2,100 miles from where I live. Healers, at least most of us, do not have the money to pay travel and hotel expences, plus paying for the Seminar itself. If he would bring it to somewhere in Texas, I might be tempted to participate."
3,Half good,I was excited to read this book since my girlfriend told me about it.I started to read the first half but I had a hard time getting into his life from birth. It was the last half where the meat and potatoes got interesting. It does tell you about the seminars. I checked into the seminars and they are so expensive. If I get enough money I will attend one. The book kind of states if you read this book you will possibly start feeling some things.I think you have to definitely have an open mind for sure.MI
3,Reconnection By Eric Pearl,The Book is Ok But you will not learn how to do what he does from it. His DVD is nothing but a sales aid to get you interested enough to take his seminar.
2,McHealing,"Great writer, fantastic reading about the person and his experiences. My respects and two stars for it. He makes ancient Hindu concepts and teachings into ""as commonly known"" facts. An honest writer always names the source. It is evident that he has learned healing visiting other schools and some ""techniques"" in more accepted schools. Is it shameful to mention them? A knowledgeable person will never criticize other disciplines, he is too aggressive toward other schools. I believe there is definitely something he has discovered and imparts something valuable but it is like he has turned fine cuisine into fast food. The hard sell in the last few pages reminds of second hand car dealer."
4,The New Science is here.......,"Eric Pearl's experience confirms the new science that is being researched and proven in many academic labs.One only needs to look beyond oneself to see that our way of understanding life is truly changing........The Reconnection offers a window in to that prism of change.""The Field"" written by Lynne McTaggart speaks of the lifeforce that is present in us all as well as the scientific proof of this lifeforce. This and Eric's Reconnection is a must read!! Even if you don't need proof......."
3,not so much,"There are many types of healings out there, and I am sure many more to come. Be wary of those that tell you their form is superior then all others.... while I did enjoy reading the book, and looked in to taking a workshop, I feel the entire reason for the book is to entice you to do the workshop ... the bottom line? to pay Dr. Pearl house payment. If you have interest and ability to do energy healing now, you might find interest in the book - and can expand on the energy healing you do now."
4,The Reconnection confirms my beliefs,I found this book to be very worthwhile to read as it confirms a lot of my beliefs about healing. I hope at some point in time to attend one of Dr. Pearl's seminars to learn first hand how to tap into the energy field he is able to access. I have done many healings in the past on myself and others and realize that healings can take place and can benefit people as much if not more than traditional medicine. I first heard about Eric Pearl on the DVD THE LIVING MATRIX Movie and highly recommend it to everyone also. When you view this movie and see Dr. Pearl working on a child with Cerebral Palsy YOU will understand the possibilities with energy healing.
4,"Amazing book, Once you get into it","The book starts off a bit uninteresting to me, talking about his birth and his childhood, but once he's out of highschool the story gets real. I had some very strange things happen to me in the process of reading this book that i'll keep to myself, (nothing bad). All that I can say is that what he offers is very real and goes along with a great teacher from the 1920's named Lester Levenson, that we are all infinite beings, we've just forgot. Eric Pearl is very down to earth and grounded human being. He puts a lot of truth forth for passing by the tons of fear based illusions that many healers buy into.. Saltwater this... and shake off negative energy that.. all fear based illusions. Very great book, reccomend it to anyone interested in truth or healing."
2,Just OK,The book is mostly about the life of Eric Pearl becoming a healer. I would rather read about how to be a header the technique he uses.The book implies you have to attend live class to learn his method. The class are now being taught by others not Eric Pearl. I learned his method with a few pages of his book towards the end section. If have done healing with my hands for many years this is another method that for relaxing. I have not cured anyone yet I have been doing it for over 9 months.
4,Fascinating personal study on touch healing,"Length:: 4:52 MinsAuthor Jason Matthews reviews The Reconnection, an intriguing personal account of Dr. Eric Pearl's experience with learning and teaching to heal by touch."
1,Waste of Time,Totally self-absorbed rubbish. I bailed after Pearl's cheap shot at the military on page 29. At least the book will recycle.
1,"Kelli Summers hot, but this movie very cold...","I have to say, if Seduction Cinema wanted to produce a best of tape, they should have just done that, rather than this ... hodge-podge of clips with a horribly written framing sequence that consists of Kelli Summers against a white wall. Summers is super hot, but this movie is not worth picking up. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan. There are many great Seduction Cinema titles."
2,Dumb but not without value,"Although it is easy to criticize this film (because its lousy ) we do get a look at Seduction Cinema's collection of starlets.The whole crowd is in it and there are only one or two girls lacking .Poor Kelli Summers is stuck with her first leading role in a real stinker but we do see a lot of skin and it's cheap so what the hell.If you always wanted to see Misty covered in mud this movie is just for you.The high light is Chelsea Mundae telling an intellectually challenged girl ""don't touch that' when she reached for her nipple .It appeared ad libbed as Chelsea had her Queen and couldn't be bothered with the dummy grabbing her tit. Also I was intrigued by Misty's sister's comfort on the camera and I would like to see more."
1,"Kelli Summers hot, but this movie very cold...","I have to say, if Seduction Cinema wanted to produce a best of tape, they should have just done that, rather than this ..., hodge-podge of clips with a horribly written framing sequence that consists of Kelli Summers against a white wall. Summers is super hot, but this movie is not worth picking up. Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan. There are many great Seduction Cinema titles(Erotic Survivor, Erotic With Project, Witchbabe, Erotic Ghost, Roxanna, Mistress Frankenstein, Titanic 2000). Skip this one, though, or buy it for Kelli Summers, who is hands down the hottest babe since Laurie Wallace!"
3,not on ps2 though,"If you have an XBox than get Far Cry:Instincts,however if you only have a PS2 get Metal Gear Solid 3:SUBSISTENCE which is another rumble in the jungle type.Helll both GREAT games if you have both systems(Like me;)) get BOTH!0i AIN`T GOT THE Subsistence game but i have the Snake Eater version but the Subsistence one will have the same game plus lots more like Online PLAY,A new camera angle,Funny theater-Or even get Far Cry Instincts Evolution which i think will be a revamp,if not another story but the fact is says ""Instincts"" tells me that the game is a revamp-unless Instincts ofcoarse is actually now part of the title of the series just like Metal Gear Solid;i used to call the original game ""Metal Gear:Solid"" but the SOLID turned out to be a new add on the title.XBox has Far Cry Instincts,PS2 has MGS3 and i guess GameCube will have to stick with Ghost Recon 2 has their best jungle game."
3,Mediocre fit,"This Camry dash kit gets the job done, but barely. First, it was a monumental struggle to get the pocket to snap into the back of the main plate -- it seemed about 1 mm too narrow, so I had to mangle it with an unnatural force that could have easily broken it. After it's all done, the kit just doesn't fit well: its curvature is a mismatch for the curve of the dashboard, and there are ghetto-looking gaps of about 1 mm all-around.The only alternatives seem to be the Scosche TA1467B / TA1468B; I'd suggest trying one of those."
2,No Satisfaction,"As a collector of ""all things Keith"", from books to his guitar picks, this book was a big disappointment. It rehashed things I have known for many years and I sincerely wish I had not paid so much for this book. But it does fill my cabinet with another piece of Keith.At the very end of the book, there was one thing which I did not know previously. If money is an issue with you at this time, please do not spend it here."
3,Not so Incredible?,"If this movie has one thing, it's John Liu. This movie, along with ""Struggle through Death"" are premier John Liu good-bad kung fu flicks. To enjoy these movies, you first have to except the obsurdity. Incredible is quite humorous, be that not all intentional. ""Shorty"" the untaker is obviously the movies comic relief, then again so is it's bad dubbed dialog. I continually laugh when the ""Dirty Half Dozen"" are going through an extensive training course, and when they crawl under sharp pointed sticks, Shorty shouts out, ""Oh, my a**?!"" Absolutely priceless.If you enjoy zany kung fu movies, then look for it in it's widescreen edition. It currently hard to find. Hopefully another American distributor will pick it up."
5,"Have both these wonderful books, easy to use.","I have both books by Donna Kooler and can not wait for book 3 and 4 to come out. I have made some beautiful items for myself and gifts from these books. Love them. Wish she didn't continue to the next page on the graph. I haven't been stiching long and I got lost once. Love these otherwise. Also the Sam Hawkins books, I have 5 of his books and can't even begin to say enough about his books. Love them."
2,Not so Fabulous,"The designs are too simple for any avid cross-stitcher,her 555 country crossstitch patterns are much more fabulous."
3,mediocre,"These performances are mediocre at best. She has clarity and stable technique but her voice as an instrument is a bit shallow. Her expressiveness is also predictable which makes her boring to listen to. The ""Art is Calling for me (Prima Donna Song)"" was annoying - Kiri te Kanawa does a much funnier version, and of course, more beautiful."
3,"A cheapie, but the only one out there","If one doesn't have the 'legendary' Washington DC ""first USA concert"" in their DVD collection (since the Apple film ""First U.S. Visit"" has been deleted), this budget DVD has most of it. It's a DVD edition of an old grey market video by the oldies video label Goodtimes - it's also their usual so-so quality, but nice to see that historic show back on the market, and for such a reasonable price. So, until the Beatles put ""First U.S. Visit"" back on the market, this isn't a bad purchase. The other material on the disc is fairly entertaining as well, most of it common but out of print, including skits from a TV show, interviews and press conferences.For a reasonable price, you get a nice glimpse of early Beatlemania, and an actual live concert. You could find worse ways to spend your money."
1,terrible quality dvd,"I read all the reviews for this and note that some customers received good quality. While I wasn't expecting crystal-clear on all parts, I'd say, on my ''copy'' (or is that copy of a copy of a copy?), that more than half the viewing is so degraded that it's totally unwatchable, and the rest of it is not much above that. I've seen far, far better quality on youtube clips, so I know this footage does exist in good quality. Will not purchase another ''GoodTimes'' product again."
1,boring,"while it is the beatles, it is VERY boring, basically they are the same DVD just rearranged. it is amazing to see the crowds and all the screaming fans but not much by the Beatles themselves. overspent and i only spent like .97 for the thing"
3,one movie for price of two? wtf...,"Advertised as two separate movies but in fact only 1 is on this tape.The movie you do get is ok, nothing more."
5,Nice Rare Footage,Nice to see some songs from the Hollywood Bowl on this one. Also a great very long interview on the Unauthorized side of this disc. A must have at a great price.
3,Not for everyone,"I can see why this book might not be for everyone, but as a designer, I have enjoyed it. I have trouble understanding the reviewer who thought the writing sounded snobbish or felt the book was simply for the wealthy. Understand his principles of design, and you can use those to do a great room with low-cost IKEA furniture if you want to."
3,not a work out kinda funny though...,so yeah this is my least favorite in the group. the routines are very short and not challenging at all. If you have two left feet and what to become more comfortable with feeling sexy this dvd may help spice up your sex life. thats about all I have to say about this one.
1,NOT A KOSHER COOKBOOK,"I bought this book and returned it when I discovered that it is full of TREIF recipes (shrimps, clam sauce, etc.) It's anyone's right to publish a treif cookbook, but please don't market it as ""Jewish cooking."""
1,wink floyd,This was a total dissappointment. Not one whole song in 3 DVDs. I could take a little commentary with the music but there is not really any music. This made good targets for my shotgun.
1,unauthorized DVD of awful quality made in china,unauthorized DVD of awful quality made in china. it actually states on the box it was not authorized by the band or copyright owners
1,An awful Dvd.,1I expedited three Dvd's of Pink Floyd music and in stead got reviews by Brit with really bad teeth. A waste of money
5,Can't wait for Album number 3,"I an ex-pat Aussie living in Canada and first fell in love with this duo back in Oz. Their first album when re-released for NA market included one of thier best tracks - Lucky Me.This follow-up album I purchased on a trip back home.""I'm Just a Girl"" is typical Bachelor Girl magic. Great tune, spot on lyrics reminiscent of Buses and Trains.""Can't Wait to Meet You"" is my favourite track. Catchy number with excellent upbeat lyric. Definitely a ""repeat 1 track"" item on this album.All tracks are winners and this album is never out of my CD player for long."
1,¡MUY DESEPCIONANTE!,"¡Esperaba un mejor producto! Aunque este producto es dirigido para los más pequeños, quizas son los mas exigentes en lo que a entretenimiento se refiere. Este producto es de animaciones muy antiguas basadas en muchas ocasiones con siluetas de colores movidas pareciera a mano, aburridas y pobres en producción. Les recomiendo en vez que compren la colección Grandes Heroes y Leyendas de la Biblia por ejemplo:Grandes Heroes y Leyendas de la Biblia: La Historia de MoisesSon de animaciones mas modernas y con mejor producción. Incluso el doblaje es muy bueno. y para completar mas economica si comparan el tiempo que invierten en cada historia."
1,problem text,"In an effort to reproduce an 18th century text, the scanning of unfamiliar fonts produces nonsense. Save yourself the problem on returning this item and avoid it."
5,Beautiful and detailed,This series of dollhouse accessories are incredibly detailed and well made. They are an indispensable addition to the well furnished dollhouse. They may not be suitable for very small children.
4,Long Live The Kings!,"Kenny Dope and Little Louie Vega, fifteen-year veterans of the club scene, revisit the Chicago-style House music of the late eighties and early nineties. Vega focuses on the dance anthems of that era, while Dope weaves a spare, seamless, largely instrumental mix over one irresistible disc.On Dope's section, lyrics are infrequent and cheesy diva wailing is used sparingly. What remains is the ecstasy minus the excess. Vega shows less restraint, and his contributions suffer accordingly. Yet he makes a few excellent choices, especially Joe Smooth's Promised Land and Frankie Knuckles' Your Love.This compilation captures the purity of a sound that in recent years has been widely commercialized, reminding us that long after the death of Disco, House got the world dancing again."
1,Save your money,Not detailed enough to be usefull. One would be better off with a decent book on multivariate methods (e.g. Multivariate Statistics for Wildlife and Ecology Research by McGargail). Code for multivariate methods in R can be found with some effort on the R-project webpage.
2,"Good tunes, but not original recordings.","The song titles are great, but these are not original recordings. They are remakes. However, they are close to the original sound. If original recordings are important to you, I wouldn't recommend this one."
4,Good,I bought this thinking it came with EVERYTHING. but their were a couple of things I ended up having to go to walmart to get. nothing crazy expensive!
2,"Too Many Tangents, Not Enough Evidence","The main problem with Domesticating History is that it claims to show that the historic houses ""reflect less the lives and times of their famous inhabitants than the political pressures of the eras during whih they transformed in museums"" -- but then barely discusses the museums themselves and the messages they conveyed. We get a lot of detail about the other political efforts of the people who tried to found these museums, but we have no way of knowing to what extent those other political beliefs manifested themselves in what visitors saw, because we never really learn *what* they saw. That many of the organizations that sprouted up to restore and maintain these homes had deep ideological divisions makes this omission even more glaring, because the reader has no way of knowing which agenda, if any, eventually won out. There is interesting and informative material here, but what argument there is, is poorly presented."
3,My least favorite Critter book,"We have many of the Critter books and this is my son's least favorite (mine too). Somehow it does not have the charm of the others. Our most read Critter books are 'Going to the Dentist' and 'I was so Mad'. If you're having trouble choosing which Critter books to purchase, I'd recommend several of the others before this one."
3,A science teacher's perspective...,"I bought this video to show to my 8th grade science class. It is very informative and covers a vast array of topics that relate to our curriculum, but the delivery is very dry. The narrator speaks almost in monotone. It is full of great information that will benefit the students if they could stay focused. I was told by many students ""Miss, this is soooo boring!""."
1,Waste of Money,"You would expect so much better from the scientists of the USGS. Pretty much a waste of tax payer money to produce such a video. It has very little ""meat"" (educational information) and it is so, so boring to put even a teacher to sleep. I have taught junior high to junior college earth science and I am not sure where you could use this video. In the future I would recommend that the USGS stick to science or at least not allow others to use their name to sell products."
3,"Good basic information, but need more depth","I am looking to start investing in rental properties and am educating myself about the industry and the process. I bought the book because of the title, and the reviews. I found some answers to my questions - such as how to calculate the cash flow from a potential property. However, the book also leaves me with some questions, such as how do you determine the expenses of a property, do you just guess? I felt that the book gave some very superficial knowledge, and I want something with more depth. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. But overall, the book is decent for someone like me, who don't own any property, and a beginner. It's also funny to read the low prices he was able to put down for properties when I live in Orange County, CA where the median home prices are in the mid-$600K."
5,Unbelievably powerful,"Michael MacDonald did an unbelievable job with this book. I've never been to Massachusetts, but through his impecable descriptions and hillarious stories, I have the clearest picture in my mind of what it must have looked like. I read a lot, and this has been the only book that I have been moved to review. It's incredibly well written, and I could not put it down, finishing it last night at about 2 am. I work in an inner-city school district, and what always amazes me is the ability of some of these young people to rise to such heights in the face of so much unbearable adversity. It's so easy to judge these young people when we have not walked in their shoes. This is a must-read for anyone who works with young people. God bless you, Michael, and congratulations on an amazing achievement."
1,very difficult read,"I found this book very difficult to really get into There are so many, many facts that it is hard to absorb them. I am interested in the history of the Irish in America, but this was overwhelming. Had it been written in a good story form, it would be easier to take. I gave up on it after several attempts to really get into it."
4,A portrait of a people's tragedy and triumph!,"I thought the strong point of Thomas Keneally's brilliant work The Great Shame was his ability to capture the personalities of the various characters as well as the persistent, hardheaded, determined nature of the Irish in general. It is amazing how so often this scandalous treatment akin to genocide of the Irish is forgotten by history in general. Keneally has done a service to all to recount so accurately the destruction and resurrection of a people. Highly recommended!"
1,All Imex figures BLOW,"I am posting this review for the second time. This product is not woth the penny to produce. The figures cannot be glued, put together, nor painted at all. Stay away from this Kind of plastic, and besides the bad review its totally dangerous due to the small parts for small childern, so easily ingested. I wish I didnt have to place even one star! But if you want a dull blue and dull grey plastic figures that can have nothing done with them then go ahead get this junk."
1,S&H is 3x the cost of the product. Not a great deal after all.,Thought I was getting a deal but when you factor in the high handling charge it's actually a lot more expensive than buying locally. My own stupid fault for for hitting 'Place Order' without really paying attention. Easy to sell product below market when you charge over three times the sale price for s&h. Lesson learned.
3,For A Good Cause,"This is a nice collection of inspirational messages. I found the individual stories interesting, but wish there had been more examples of people living with MS. I know that many people with MS suffer with vision problems, so I was surprised that the print in this book was a little difficult to read (especially the smaller print in the preface). Although it is artistically pleasing, I would prefer print that is easier to see. Even though this material was rather lightweight, because Mr. Williams is donating his royalties to MS research, I think it is a good investment."
3,Interesting bk.,"Have not had the time to read it, but it looks very interesting. The book is in great shape."
1,Life Lessons and Reflections by Montel Williams,"This book is not what I thought it was going to be and not anything like a normal book,or Montel's other book ""Climbing Higher"" this book is a very small book like 6 inches by 6 inches hardcover and has poems and pictures andstupid phrases. This is a waste of money,write me and you can have mine free..."
4,Life Lessons And Reflections,"I bought the book because I too have MS and because the money was going to a good cause, to find a cure someday. I was hoping it would of told a little bit more about how Montel was dealing with having MS, but I did find it excellent reading."
2,How Long Has Montel Had MS?,"What we really need is a book about ordinary people with MS leading extraordinary lives! Throughout this book, I never was under the impression that it was Montel writing. While I appreciate his efforts in bringing MS to the forefront as a celebrity, how long has he had this disease, how much light was he really able to shed on the debilitating effects of the disease (not too much)... certainly, though, donating the proceeds of the book to MS is noble."
