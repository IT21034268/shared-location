1,Crap... a loser compared to Like Water For Chocolate.....,What unbelievable garbage.... the only salvagable part was the CD that came with the wasted paper that is a so called book.... so disappointing after reading the great first book by her... Like Water For Chocolate.... 0 stars
1,Appalling on several different levels,"Fortunately I have not read Like Water For Chocolate, and so I didn't have particularly high expectations concerning the quality of prose in this book, and reading the jacket prepared me for a rather sappy story. Nevertheless, this was both the most poorly written and poorly conceived book I've read in a long time (if ever!). The writing style reminded me of that of an overstimulated teenager, and the characters were all but empty of substance. What I found most appalling, however, were the ridiculous new-age pseudophilosophies, and the horrendous misinterpretations of karma and reincarnation. Honestly, the whole thing was so bad it was just embarrassing. So glad it was a loaner, not a purchase!"
3,Nice Concept,"I really enjoyed the multimedia experience that reading this book offered. I think Laura Esquivel is redefining how we view books. I don't think this was great work of liturature, but it was a fun read and a great book for meditation and introspection . . . . not to mention dancing."
1,Maybe the worst book I have ever read.,"I can find nothing of value in this book except perhaps the nice drawings. Since this review is to be less than 1000 words, I cannot hope to list all that I found lacking in the book. I will list a couple of problems, however. First, the book is a poor imitation of the magic realisim genre typified by Garcia Marquez. Second, the characters are as flat as central Illinois. Third, the book contradicts itself in several places (when the author is trying to be serious). Fourth, there is no plot, just a sequence of events. Fifth, the philosophical attempts are poorly done, relying on catch phrases and nice sounding words rather than on substance. Sixth, it shares much with the fairy tales of youth in that nothing bad can ever happen to the characters without some solution dropping out of thin air. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Well, maybe to potential authors to see how not to write a book."
1,"If you enjoyed Like Water For Chocolate, avoid this book","I loved Like Water For Chocolate and was excited to find that Laura Esquivel had written another book. The synopsis inside the book jacket sounded very interesting to me. However, after the first chapter of this book, I was put off by the disjointed plot.The author employs much the same style as in her first attempt, but the book disintegrates into a disjointed science fiction story filled with violent images.I took this book out of the library (thank goodness I didn't waste good money on buying a copy) and thus did not hear the CD that came with it to complete the multimedia assault; I may have missed an integral part of the experience, but I doubt it. The drawings included in the book were pointless, in my opinion.I finished this book only for pride. I applaud Ms. Esquivel's efforts to produce a wide variety of works, but this book was just bad."
1,Disappointment,"I was so looking forward to reading this book and I can only say, now that I am finished, that I am saddly disappointed. With her book, Like Water for Chocolate, Esquivel proved herself as a wonderfully imaginitive and passionate writer. I'm not sure what happened with this, her latest book. The basic premis was good, but for whatever reason, Esquivel was unable to pull it together. It was sloppy and boring and sappy. The only good thing about this book was the wonderful CD of music that came with it. With all this said, I do look forward to reading her next book. This woman has talent! She needs to rely less on gimmicks and more on her own magical story-telling abilities."
1,Nowhere close to LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE,"I loved LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, but THE LAW OF LOVE was terrible. The storyline was very unbelievable. The author seemed to be going for a mix of sci-fi and romance and failing at both. It is the only book that i have stopped reading in the middle and thrown out."
5,Repeat reader of this novel....Love it,"I have borrowed this book from the library twice now and felt I needed to purchase it, as I enjoy the difference of its content, and I was so happy to be able to acquire it from you, Thank you so verrrrrrrrry much,even though it has wording in the margins, it sort of adds to its validity, now I get to ponder on what the previous reader was getting out of it.Thank you once again, and I will be using this site, now that I've discovered it, as myself and my daughter are avid readers.b.well b.happyleonie"
4,Like Water for Chocolate meets Richd. Condon's Money is Love,"A great book, if a little bumpy in places.Water/Chocolate looked at the fantasy of the effect of the cook's mindset on the effect that food has on the eaters. Money is Love explores what happens when the entire set of gods--Judeo/Christian, Greeks, Romans, and the baddies, Lucifer, Beelzebub and that bunch--meet to figure out what the big deal is about Money. Everyone on earth seems to be going bananas to get it, they do strange things with it when they do get it, etc.In Money/Love, N'zuriel (""Little Yaweh"") leads the convention to figure it all out. In Law of Love, we find that 14000 reincarnations determine peoples' suitabilties for governing, loving, hating. Hard to believe that Esquivel hasn't read and admired Condon.But the work isn't derivative: it's wonderfully original and refreshing. And it's almost as funny as Condon's, a very big plus!"
1,What happened to the poetic prose?,"I could hardly wait to get this book home! I am such a fan of ""Like Water for Chocolate."" I even drove 120 miles one way to see the film.This book, however, isn't worth the paper it's printed on. The CD was a good idea, but much of the music didn't really match the mood of the story-line...whatver THAT was.LOVED ""Like Water for Chocolate."" HATED this drivel!"
3,Bad Translation,"Sayers Peden may know Spanish but her knowledge of Mexican Spanish is lacking. I was appalled when I read the original Spanish and saw how much more funny the book is. Plus, she does not do justice to the slang and the musical lyric translations, which there is a lot of. I recommend the book for its philosophy but take into consideration that the original is full of Mexican slang."
2,Not the best book I've read,"This book had some interesting views on reincarnation and what the future might be like, but I found the story and characters otherwise lacking. It was far too ""preachy"". In other words, the author seems to use the book to give her opinions on love and life that could easily have been summed up in a short essay. Instead, she uses a few watered-down characters to deliver a lot of poorly constructed points."
5,"The Law of love, I love it!","The Law of Love, is my favorite book. I've gone throught two copies on tape. And am looking for it on CD so that I can play it in my car when I down. I really would love to see this book as a movie. Laura Esquivel, thank you for such wonderful adventures. My soul craves more! I wanted to see this on the screen, I guess it has to wait for the right moment to be a movie, the world really needs it now and so do I.Sencerely with love, Per, Chicago"
2,"a good book, but that is all","this book was a quick decent read, but i expected more. i liked the way ms. esquivel mixed scien fiction with romance, but it was hard to grasp her message when you are not taking the plot seriously"
3,Do not leave shore with this book.,"Unlike her previous bestseller ""Like Water for Chocolate"", L. E.'s new book does not make the reader get in touch with the characters, quite possibly because she explores them very little or, which is my choice, because the characters do not have anything to explore into. The book is a bit entertaining, though not interesting. Do not leave shore with this book; it is not what will help you pass the time if you're stuck in a deserted island"
4,a must have...,"Have been thinking of Chris as a member of the band where I have had one of my alltime favorite Dan Stuart as the main figure. I've been been waiting for for Dan for almost 7 years now.. Slightly disappointed of what Chuck Prophet has come up with (though sometimes brilliant..), I thought, why not check out what Chris is doin'... .and what a surprise... This is so cool, soft and delightful. Actually I am a bit sad that I havn't paid that much attention that I should all these years...Sorry for that..."
4,"A dark, atmospheric, creepy little movie....","I guess I'm old school when it comes to horror these days, and Infection worked for me. Less is more in the horror genre as far as what is shown to us, and this movie follows that rule very well. I hate it when reviews give everything away, so in a nutshell: A decaying hospital (as well as healthcare system) is the setting for this nicely done thriller. Fear of illness, infection, hospitals, the dark, doctors.... they're all covered here. A botched death at the hands of doctors, a mysterious patient dropped off at the E.R., a hospital with very dark rooms and corridors, an aggressive virus that disolves it's host. The movie really builds tension, and the payoff does not insult the viewer. Most horror films today are pretty silly, and this was a nice little gem to discover. Highly recommended."
1,A Floater,"Imagine yourself swimming in a murky polluted sea, everything around is kinda hazy and boring, but you're sure something interesting will happen. After 40 boring minutes of nothing you start to notice a faint shape in the distance coming closer, maybe it could be something interesting, hopefully all this build-up floating in this boring stangant mess will pay off to something interesting, ok let's just wait 40 more minutes, something interesting is BOUND to happen, that object is getting closer and closer...5 Minutes left, the faint object is floating closer and closer... what is it?? It's a floating piece of s***, this movie is a vague saturated boring turd floating around until it eventually hits you in the face, and you've just realized that you endured 2 hours floating in turd water, and all you get for it is s*** on your face."
1,Bad-avoid like the plague,This film was boring and convoluted. One big mess that you shouldnot waste your precious cash on.
4,Great movie,"Japanese horror films never disappoint me. This movie is sure to make you scream or at least be grossed out. However, I will say that the ending leaves you confused and thinking ""What just happened"". Even if it all falls apart at the end, it is a solid horror film."
4,creepy visuals and atmosphere but not as good as i expected,I was expecting a lot from this movie. The trailers made it seem much more exciting/scarier than it actually was. The acting was meh and I lost interest about half way through. The hospital itself was scary though and I would watch again for the architectural details. Also ... the case it came in was broken!!!
3,Infection creeps under your skin,"There's something special about Japanese movies that has always facinated me;First the chacters are just nasty and second they always get away with things that the Rating board would wince and shudder towards.The story is simple;four doctors and three nurses make a fatal injection on a patient with a pathonic infection and decide to cover up there mistakes.The only problem is that a doctor/carrier witness the cover-up and releases the infection.To tell you everything that happens would be deplorible and ruin everything.The movie is in YELLOW subtitels so reading them is easy.It's a great little movie to watch when it's raining,so sit back in a chair turn the lights off and be prepared to be creeped out when watching this little gem. One last note;To be quite honest at the end I found myself checking for rashes its that contagious."
2,Guarnieri does not live up to his Brazilian contempoprary,"Of course, we all know Villa-Lobos. This music is not even near the level of Villa-Lobos. It is really music that's very busy, loud and unnspiring. Is this the best of Brazilian symphonic music? I sure hope that's not so. The performance itself is hard to judge. The recording has so much echo attached to it, and the sound is so thick, that everything kind of sounds the same: Very thick. No special colors or dynamics... No inspiration, no greatness whatsoever. Quite disapointing, actually."
1,A very bad tree saw,"This saw works very well on its first use BUT even though it looks like stainless steel it isn't. It is labeled Sweedish steel and it rusts like the very devil.When I went to use it the second time, it was so badly rusted as to be nearly useless."
4,Electro something?,"Some call it electroclash, others call it nu punk, I call it Adult. This is my first album by this band, and I like many of the songs. I wouldn't say that this is a five star album, but it certainly gets a strong ok. The music is pretty cool, and the female vocals have that punk chick vibe that makes them stand out as a truly original band. My only complaint is that after a while, some of the songs start to boar me."
3,Inferior compared to the old Hot Shot,"I bought this Hot Shot almost six months ago. I have had two Hot Shots, the old design. One lasted 9 years of daily use, the other six years of daily use: both started to leak, which is a 3 cent repair. If Sunbeam were so kind and provided a spare rubber gasket I would still use the first one I bought.The new design is inferior. It is shorter, a larger (normal size) mug doesn't fit under it. Second issue is that the thermostat that prevents the water from over-boiling is now placed in an area where the water get get to it.This is what happened to my unit: it is now unusable, and I have returned to the old model: a little leak is much better than burning myself on over-boiling water every time I use this appliance.I am going to hunt for an old model... it lasted a lot longer than six months."
3,Cannot live without my Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser,"Still like this product but I liked my 20-year-old one much better. My older one had a higher area to place your cup or other container. This one is shorter in space. Cannot get my big mug in there. Otherwise, this product heats up water very fast and I simply could not imagine living without it."
2,Not durable like they used to be,"I have had about 4 of these in the last 3 years. The reason I ordered it in the first place is becauseI had one that lasted 10 years and I never had a problem. Now they seem to be cheaply made, because after about6 to 8 months of use, the plastic dispenser piece breaks off, and you have no way of getting the waterto dispense. Won't buy another, due to this problem."
2,Design flaws in this particular model.,"I found the design in this particular model 6142 flawed. A large mug doesn't fit under the dispenser. Another issue was all the water doesn't drain out. In addition, this model lasted just over a year before it quit working. It was my second Hot Shot Water Dispenser. My first one, of which I don't know the model number, lasted years. I love the concept. As a tea drinker, nothing beats this handy little machine for design, price and how quickly the water heats. It is also great for making a quick meal with instant oatmeal, soup, etc. I just don't like this model 6142. I recently purchased the Sunbeam Hot Shot Model 6170. The design is better and I hope it lasts longer. I'll again be a happy customer if it does."
1,Sunbeam 6142 Hot Shot Hot Water Dispenser,I have used this product for years and wanted to replace it with a new one. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in the new design. It bends forward when you push the Dispense button and you can't fill this one up like the old design because it runs all over the countertop. The ON button at the back top is better than where it used to be. That's right: I hate the new design.
5,Great for college students,"This little hot water dispenser is great for dorm living. You can have hot water anytime you need it and it gets really super hot! You can make cup o noodles, oatmeal, or just have a cup of hot tea or hot chocolate. I would highly recommend this little item for college dorm students. My only recommendation is to use a large coffee cup bowl with a handle instead of the ceramic bowl because the bowl gets very hot."
5,Use it Everyday,"My sister told me about this product about 2 years ago. I bought one and LOVE IT!Use it every day. It's held up beautifully. One of the best purchases I've ever made. It's great for tea, instant coffee or coffee bags, or for a shot of hot water whenever you need it FAST. Buy one, you won't regret it! It's also available in black."
2,The Gift,"Not satisfied - did not receive the item requested - was given a refund to my account - why not send another item to replace the one not received, after all I did want the product,if I had wanted a refund I wouldn't have placed an order in the first place. (There would be more customer satisfaction receiving the product than getting the refund) - Also what I don't understand is this item (CD)cost approx $6.00 and it took 4 weeks to process ???"
5,Kenny Rodgers The Gift,This is one of Kenny Rodgers older CD that my friend told me about. It is a Christmas CD that is so great that I have just taken it off my stereo. I really loved it!! There some songs on it that are not on all other Christmas CD's
5,Great Seasonal Music from Amazon,The album is wonderful. But I bought it for one song which is so beautiful. Mary did you know.I will listen all year not just at Chrisymas time.
5,like this,"Love this cd...has my favorite song, Mary, Did You Know, with Wynonoa Judd duet. Nice Christmas music, love Kenny Rogers"
5,Very Special Kenny Rogers CD,"A ""must"" for the Kenny Rogers fan. Very special selections and heartwarming music with a lot of great singers assisting Kenny. Truly a Great Find!"
5,The Gift,"""The Gift"" is my favorite Christmas music.It has the best songs ever! If you listen to ""The Gift"" you'll hear the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ."
3,Theater majors might be bored...,"I read this text for my theater appreciation class. As a theater major that already knows most of the basics, it was boring at times for me personally, but it is a good source to get information on theater."
5,Good as the 11th edition from what I can tell.,"I bought this book for an intro to Theater class that requires the 11th edition. I figured I'd give saving some money a shot, then went through the chapters and compared the chapter titles with the chapter titles in the syllabus after classes started. Wouldn't you know it, they ended up being the same chapters with occasional renaming, but back one. For example, chapter four in the eleventh edition is the same as chapter three in this one. (Chapter 5, aka chapter 4 in the 10th edition, has a different title: ""Stage Spaces"" became ""Theater Spaces."") Otherwise, from what I can tell, they're practically similar.How did this happen, you ask? The introductory chapter in the tenth edition doesn't have a chapter number, and in the eleventh edition, it got one."
5,Sorry!,Sorry for the late review I am new to Amazon. BUT the book is great came on time and in great condition!
5,Works every time.,"For most of my life I have had problems with my bronchial tubes, typically during season changes or if I am exposed to high levels of dust or fumes. My problem always starts with a light wheezing that intensifies until I can barely sleep, from that point I only have a short period of time to see a medical doctor for a breathing treatment or some albuterol before I reach full blown bronchitis. For years I coped with with annual bouts of bronchitis and occasionally pneumonia. About 3 years ago I first tried Clear Lungs when I started wheezing and to my surprise my wheezing stopped within a few hours, and after taking it for a day my wheezing stopped entirely. I have since taken Clear Lungs every time I start to wheeze and have had consistently good results. Whats more is if I take a few capsules before I confront a known trigger I can avoid the wheezing episodes all together. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has had similar issues.D. Cwik"
2,no change,"I used this for 2 weeks, and didn't see any change whatsoever. Did not work for me. Maybe someone else would benefit,"
1,Clear Lungs...not really,"Bought the product for my Dad who has severe emphesyma--he has been taking it now for at least 6 months, sorry to report no real improvement."
1,Didn't work for me,This Clearlungs product worked just like many other herbal products I've tried for many years -- it did nothing except lighten the wallet.
1,Haven't noticed any difference,"I got this item for myself and my daughter when we were coming down with bronchitis. I never noticed anything happening, and eventually we both had to go to the doctor for antibiotics. My daughter has asthma, so I was really hopeful that this would work. I am a fan of other chinese formulas, and we are never without Gan Mao Ling in our house."
5,LOVE IT,I have taken this product for many years(ever since it first produced) I try not to run out but if I do I can really tell the difference! I LOVE this Product.
4,ridge crest clear lungs,"Have copd have used liquid clear lungs approx 2 weeks seems to help releive congestion will contionue to use , i prefer the liquid instead or capsules.."
5,Love this - relieved my dry cough!,"I've been suffering from seasonal allergies this year that have caused breathing issues. I hate using medications (especially inhalers) so I've been searching to something to replace them. I bought the ClearLungs liquid (I have the pills on their way) and I've been surprised at how effective this stuff is! Day two of using this stuff I stopped my inhaler and didn't use it for a few days! I'm thrilled! It's helped with chest congestion, tightness in the chest, taking deeper breaths, and this most importantly - this annoying CONSTANT dry cough I have. I definitely recommend giving it a try."
5,AWESOME! OUTSTANDING!,"Brilliant - Madonna brings a fresh spin to her 90's music, with everything from elaborate costumes, futuristic sets, and a voice like you have never heard from her before! WAY TO GO MO!"
4,Madonna---entertaining as always!,"I,like many fans, hated that several of Madonna's biggest hits were left out of this concert. That aside, Madonna, being the chameleon she is, changes our perceptions of her and gives an entertaining concert with lots of incredible costumes, great set design and some really cool choreography---Crouching Tiger style. Concentrating on her two previous cds, ""Ray of Light"" and ""Music"", Madonna weaves her set of songs from moody and dark to light and free. A cool dvd and a good concert to own."
5,MORE THAN PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!,I love that concert.It's her best world tour ever.Her voice is at her best.The tracklisting is also perfect.Costumes are amazing.Dancing is great.the most original part of the show is the geisha part.the best part is 70's punk.but she shouldn't have performed i deserve it and the funny song.this show is perfect.
4,Impressive,"I wasn't that hard core impressed with the first part of the show, with Madonna in a kilt but when the Japanese inspired parts came on, I was blown away. Also what I enjoyed wa sthe incorporation of anime into the stadium performance. I really, really like Janet Jackson but I think that Madonna, ten years older, therefore more seasoned, is really good at designing a show along with the many art directors and so that she must work with. Janet's Hawaii show is more hardcore dancing routines while Madonna's show seems to incorporate themes to be contemplated on. I imagine that in 10 years time, Janet will be doing much the same. Overall a great show and it's a kick that ROsie O'Donnell took the cover pic while at the concert."
4,A Good Effort,"Unlike most of the other reviwers, I'm not a Madonna fan, although at times I do find her music and performances pleasing. I had the opportunity to see the live version, the HBO version, and the DVD version of the tour. One aspect of this tour that pops into my mind is how good Madonna sounds, especially for a singer that has a weak voice, which becomes even weaker live. The performance and set designs were very imaginitive and should be given credit to for trying to stay away from today's ""Teen-pop"" dance moves and style. At times I questioned Madonna's choices of the songs she performed but it seems like she wanted to focus more on her later music rather than her early hits. Although, this tour is not as good as some of her previous ones (like the Blond Ambition Tour) it was an entertaining show and worth purchasing the DVD/VHS."
1,Not her best show...,"""The Drowned World Tour"" wasn't Madonna's best show. Although the show was good it wasn't excellent. Her ""Blond Ambition,"" and ""Girlie Show"" was her best, but she kind of tried a little too hard on this one to impress the audience. Although I must say this is a really good show, but it isn't her best. She didn't sing any of her old songs (Besides ""La Isla Bonits,"" and ""Holiday"".) I mean, she could have atleast sung ""Rain,"" ""Vogue,"" ""I'll Remember,"" ""Take A Bow,"" ""Bedtime Story,"" or ""Material Girl,"", and I also thought she could of done a better performance of ""La Isla Bonita,"" ""Holiday,"" and ""What It Feels Like For A Girl (Spanish Version)."""
1,What has gone on with Madonna????,"Now, having being a fan of madonna for over a year already, i've had much experience of her c.d.'s. this concert made me think back to the days when madonna was in the 'erotica' stage. horrible. and what is up with the japanese cartoon? it was stupid and i didn't know why it was shown. nothing to do with madonna, very obscene. every single thing of madonna that i own is at least 1,000 times better than this 'erotic' deja vu concert. her voice is great, her outfits are wonderful,but the way she acted on that stage was very disappointing. the only exception is the very beginning and the very end, where there is no sign of anything funky happening.note to all madonna fans, please do not buy this dvd unless you really truly loved madonna's 'erotic' days. it's not worth the money and certainly only a recurrent dream of 'erotica' and the sex book."
1,Aburrido,"No se que le paso a los productores o a Madonna, pero el concierto fue totalmente aburrido, baila muy poco y no se ve con tanta energia como en otros conciertos. La verdad que mal gaste el dinero en este concierto. PARA NADA ME GUSTO NO LO PUEDO RECOMENDAR."
5,Amazing.,"I have been a Madonna fan for four years now, and have found this show to be amazing and quite an experience! It was shorter than I felt it would be but very well done, Madonna, once again! I got the chills when Nobody's Perfect was performed and the way Human Nature ended. The only negative was how short it felt."
1,wrong zone,i got this dvd big let down icant even play it in my dvd player massage pops up wrong zone cant play back so becare full when ordering this dvd
3,"The concert is fantastic, but the DVD isn't","Madonna is at her best when she's on stage performing her hits in a musical theater format. Drowned World Tour is by far her most ambitious project to date, musically and theatrically. It's more toned down compared to Blonde Ambition or Girlie Show, but it's more ambitious in that she sings live (no back tracks) here more times than the other two and she plays her guitar. The marriage between video and live theater is also ideal here. HOWEVER, there's nothing in the DVD except the concert and a photo gallery. The production company could have added some bonus features like a loook at the production process, a sneak peak backstage, etc..."
3,"Get with the Times Madonna, HBO","I swear I will throw the next DVD out the window that enters my home without widescreen and DTS capabilities! Why, oh why would anyone press a new CONCERT DVD without DTS sound? Why, oh why would anyone put out a full screen version of such a wonderful visual show as Madonna's? But then when I watched it on HBO's HDTV channel 509 I couldn't understand why it was broadcast in full screen then. Do any of the suits running these entertainment companies UNDERSTAND technology?As far as the show goes, I too saw it in Vegas AND on HBO. The music is great, her voice is at its best. However, the non-stop dance we've come to expect from Madonna pretty much stops mid-show as Material Mom has to pause to rest her 40+ year old bod for much of the second half.Nevertheless, the show was great and having a weakly produced DVD to remember it by is better than nuthin'."
5,Who Else But Madonna?!,"What is left to be said? Madonna is a living legend and her ""Drowned World Tour"" was a testement to that. Who else could hit the road with a completely offbeat, dark, and essentially fabulous production? Name one person...I dare you. The DVD of the show is a different edit from the version aired on HBO in August of 2001. And the audio and video quality have been amped up (hence the DVD right?!), to a brilliant effect. The quality is crisp and clear, and through headphones the sound is amazing. Theatrical in nature, Madonna's ""Drowned World Tour"" has now made way for her more straight forward ""Re-Invention Tour""...but don't let the lack of catalog hits fool you. This show will make you think and showcases Madonna's tremendous experimentalist ideas. A definate must see."
2,It was so so,"I actually went to see her in NYC. Production wise, I applaude her, but musically - call me old school - I wished she played more of her older stuff. Her music in the last 10 years hasn't excited me like it did when I was a kid in the 80's."
5,Take A Musical Journey through the Drowned World of Madonna,"I had the opportunity to see this show live in Los Angeles. Although the DVD cannot capture the actual endorphins of the crowd, it is the next best thing to being there. For those who have never seen Madonna live, this is the closest thing to actually being there. Don't expect Madonna to get up there and crune out some of her older hits like 'Vogue' and 'Express Yourself'. Instead, you will see amazing reinditions of some of her later works like the opening 'Drowned World' and the phenominal, foot stopming encore of 'Music'. Madonna puts on a great performance, there's no question. The theatrical staging, visuals, and choreographing has Madonna written all over it. I highly recommend the Drowned World DVD."
3,drowned world.,"Not my favourite Madonna concert.Although interesting , it isn't as good as previous tours like Blonde Ambition and The Girlie Show, both of which were brilliant.Parts of it were excellent and what people have come to expect from Madonna.The highlights being Impressive Instant, Beautiful Stranger, Ray of Light, Frozen, Nobody's Perfect, Don't tell me, La Isla Bonita, Holiday and Music.Pretty good overall, and a good buy."
3,Somewhat entertaining,This concert is definately not as exciting and thrilling as her other concerts. She sings most of the songs so she is limited in her actual stage performance. She stands still during MOST of the songs (around 20 songs)with an exception of a couple (2 or 3) where she actually dances around the stage. She has very few stage props and skits in comparing to her other concerts. She is getting older and seems to have much less energy than she used to. Unless you are a big Madonna fan don't waste your money. Try renting it or wait until it comes on HBO.
5,the queen is back on stage,i saw thi show 2 times live.once in milan and once in paris.i also saw the show on HBO.and i have only one word for explain this dvd:AMAZING!!!!!!!!
2,dissapointed,"If you are looking for Madonna's hits during a concert, this one shows most of her newest songs. What dissapointed the concert for us was the artsy look to the concert. I realize that some like that, but we found it odd, and took away from her great performance. But if you are into women wearing gas masks, and stuff like that, you will probably enjoy this.Rent this video/DVD before you buy it."
5,Excellent concert as well as the production!,"Madonna's last tour three years before the 2004 one was another solid show all throughout. Most of the songs performed come from her last two albums, Ray of Light and Music, but they all come off as entertaining. I liked that she included Human Nature. Nothing Really Matters, Drowned World, Music, Holiday, Ray of Light, and a lot of others are superb. I like how she does Gone with one spotlight in front of her. She is still tops with her dancers and choreography. The costume changes are fabulous. One song that's funny is The Funny Song, as she shifts to a country mode. As always, she's still wild, but she does what she wants and she's good at it. Excellent concert that she did for her hometown Detroit area crowd in Auburn Hills, Michigan!"
5,Pre 9-11 Zietgeist Pop Diva Oracle,"The goddess POP Oracle of our time offers up a pre 9-11 surreal look into her heart, mind & world. She elevates the moment with incredible performances and stage direction. The music & lyrics are a perfect reflection and zeitgeist of that moment in time (Aug. 2001). And in retrospect, the concert eerily foreshadows a glimpse of the darker days to come. You got to have it!"
3,Why not in DTS 5.1,I still don't understand why Madonna did not release this in DTS 5.1 sound. And from it's not in widescreen either and wasn't shown wide in HBO's high def channel. The whole point of getting DVDs is to get the best sound and pic. What a waste. But better that nothing. We still haven't seen Blonde Ambition tour released in DVD. It's only on laser disc.
2,She has done better,"I saw the show in person on August 2, 2001 in NJ, and I wasn't very impressed. The show would have been much better if she did more older songs. I'm not to sure what she has against her old song, considering that most of them are better than her new songs. Sitting on hay and playing the gutiar and flying through the air dressed as some Japanese shmuck doesn't really sit well with me. It just doesn't seem like Madonna. The one good song however was La Isla Bonita, but if she had to pick an older song to sing, why did she sing that one? She did sing it on the Girlie Show. And overall the show was way to short. She could have added about 5 more songs. I really would only buy this if you are a huge Madonna fan and you need to have it. Other wise, you will be disappointed."
3,Variable Content,"This dvd has a few excellent songs/performances and many that I would watch only once. Relative to other Madonna dvd's this was better than ""Girlie - Live in Sydney"" but not as good as ""Live in Italy"" and ""Virgin Tour"". A show which summarizes all of her hits would be nice."
5,Madonna rules!,"For the longest time I rejected Madonna music: it just didn't go with me, I disliked it. But since she released the 'Ray of Light' album, and then with 'Music' (both of which are at the core of the set list for this concert) her music took off to a new level in my eyes, thanks largely to the production of William Orbit.Now, this concert is simply mindblowing. It's all you could ever wish for in a live performance and more, since Madonna always pushes the envelope with her visuals and her open flirting with sexuality, and this one is no exception. My favorite moment in the concert, the transition between the two Spanish songs, ""Lo Que Siente la Mujer (What It Feels Like for a Girl)"" and ""La Isla Bonita."""
1,Gave my DVD away,"I supposedly had bought the last ticket available for the Concert when it was scheduled for Continental Airlines Arena at Meadowlands, NJ., and I was supposed to see it in August 2001. However, because of a sore throat, Madonna cancelled. Boy, am I glad she did and I received my money back. I would have trekked out there alone, by public transportation and been BORED TO DEATH. I know because I bought the DVD to see the ""concert"" I missed. Didn't miss anything. She doesn't even seem to have been there herself. I was so disappointed that I gave my DVD away. All her previous concerts were great, so don't know what happened."
2,Not An Impressive Instant,"I saw the Drowned World Tour live 3 times, twice here in New York and once in Atlanta. When I saw the HBO special I was completely unimpressed. First of all, in 95% of US venues, Madonna performed You'll See live in place of the flat, blase Gone. The live version of You'll See completely blows Gone out of the water. For some strange reason, Madonna decided to showcase Gone on the HBO performance. DWT is something that must be seen live, and it lost a lot on the HBO performance. To whomever said that they didn't understand why it was a dark concert, many of the themes on Ray of Light were quite dark and choosing not to understand a ""dark performance"" is rather superficial."
5,Works Very Well!,"We have a 1 year old Beagle/Boston Terrier Mix, and she loves to take off when she sees other people or animals. After we put the collar on her a couple times, we can just give the warning tone and she stops what she's doing. Also, with having the Beagle nose, she is constantly sniffing things that she shouldn't, and now we don't have anymore problems. We were worried about the battery life, but we haven't had a problem. We only put the collar on when necessary, and turn it off as soon as we are done using it. Overall, it worked very well for us, it was well worth the money!"
1,I Returned This Collar,"The training tone was inaudible and even though the signal tester said the collar was working fine, my dog couldn't get any stimulation unless she was less than 3 feet away from me."
1,"DO NOT BUY, OR USE, IF YOU GET IT FREE !","this product sucks.i have gone through 4 transmitters,12 different receivers.innotek replaced all as each item would fail.but now my warranty is up so.... i got nothing,that works anyway.the collars are dangerous as well as shotty because the distance they claim is B.S. my poor dogs got over shocked as i thought the setting was to low,only to see him jump 3 feet in the air when he got 25 feet away.i hate this company.i wish i could put this collar on all that work there & then give them the over stimulation my best buddy got.this is why i wrote don't even use if you get it free."
1,worked for a year. Lifetime warranty was not fulfilled by the company,Lifetime warranty to them meant they will sell you a new one at a discount. They wanted $100 the second one last even less.
2,displeased,"Have had the collar less than six months. Collar does not charge and hand held remote will not talk to collar. Called customer care. Technician ""thought "" it was a charger problem. Wanted me to send $$ do get another charger. I did some more digging and found when collar is defective it flashes a weak red signal.When collar did work, I was very pleased with its performance. It should have lasted longer........"
3,Innotech remote trainer,"I have been happy with the Innotech remote training collar. My 9 mo old golden retrieve seems to be responding to it well. My primarily complaint is that the remote isn't rechargable like the collar is. The battery door on the remote isn't the friendliest design. I have already managed to break the tabs on it while changing the battery. The screw still holds the cover on; however, the remote can now no longer be considered very ""waterproof""."
1,Piece of crap,"As many of the other have stated, this thing worked awesome for a VERY short period of time. I own a boxer and he is by far one of the strongest willed of his breed. When the collar and remote communicate as described, he obeys without fail. Unfortunately, after only a week the remote and collar would only work sporadically. It has never been in the water, dropped or even chewed on. It just quit working! Manufacturer has done nothing but give me a run around and request that I pay for repairs or replacement. Don't waste your money."
1,what,I read an endorsement from dog problems . com that recommends this product. We have not yet been able to get ours to work. Spent $10 on new batteries as hand held indicates low battery. There is not one indication that dog has received a signal. Would really like to get this resolved. Hoping that company will make good on the product.
4,Good collar for the price,"We've owned this collar for three years and are buying a second one, so I suppose I've been happy with it. More or less works as advertised, is rugged enough to stand up to our large dog romping around with it, and seems to have plenty of power and range.Only gripe is that the collar itself would be better if it offered a way to remove and replace the rechargeable battery. Seems like the only problem with my older unit is that the battery no longer holds a charge, but the unit itself is sealed and there seems to be no way to replace the battery without destroying the collar. I'll be returning it under warranty to see if it can be repaired, but this would be unnecessary if there was a way to do it myself.Otherwise, quite happy with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality training collar."
4,Excellent product,"I've had two of these collars for more than two years. I use them almost every day. My dogs do everything with the collars, including swimming. The collars are incredibly durable, both my collars have gouges and scratches.If you follow the training instructions you will very good results with training. Both my dogs were off leash trained in under 2 weeks. Remember though, this is not a punishment device.My only complaint is the remote, its too small. With gloves (winter time) on you cannot push just one button.I originally tried the two dog system, forget about that. You need one remote per dog, you cannot stimulate both dogs at the same time with the two dog system. This is useful when the dogs take off after something at the same time."
1,Didn't do the trick,I tried this product for over three weeks. The remote battery lost charge quickly and the collar did not make good contact with my dog. The truth is that the negative tone should be enough to get your dogs attention but with this product the tone is inaudible and so my dog did not pay attention to it. I used the 400 yard and park petsafe collar on my other dog at the same time and had the opposite experience. The collar worked at a low voltage and the negative tone is loud enough to get the dogs attention so I don't ever have to use the shock feature. The petsafe collar has both a rechargable remote and collar as opposed to just a recharchable collar.
1,Do not buy this product,I purchased this product 7 months ago and have had replacement parts shipped to me five times. Four times replaced the collar and the hand held and once the charger. This product does not hold a charge and although it indicates it is fully charged it isn't. I have charged the the collar put new batteries in the hand held and within a few hours the collar is not working. This happens time and time again. When you need to rely on the collar you can't. I have a 100 pound doberman and I need to rely on this product. I am currently searching to purchase another training collar from another company. Hopefully I can find one more reliable.
1,This is a hit or miss product.,"I purchased this collar last year and can honestly say that it's not very reliable. The charge does not take well. The light indicates that evertyhing is fully charged and working but I get no signal when I make a correction on my dog. I know that I have the collar on tight enough, in fact sometimes I worry that it was too tight. We've tried several of there other collars without much luck. I could not in good faith recommend this product."
1,Waste of money,"We had borrowed this collar from a friend and loved it. The dog listened and the tone was enough to get his attention. Our friend needed it back, so we went to the store and bought one ourselves.We have had nothing but problems with this collar. It only works some of the time and he has to be really close. We returned it before the 1 year warranty was up and they gave us a new remote. The first time they sent us the wrong remote after us going 3 weeks without being able to use the collar. So, then we had to wait even longer for them to send us the correct remote. The new remote worked correctly for maybe a week and now it doesn't work at all.They must have some manufacturing problems and some people are getting ""lemons"" while others are getting the one that works well. I wish we could buy our friend's off of him so we had a working collar again."
5,Wonderful Transaction,"I could not have found a better price anywhere nor a better product. Delivery was almost instant.I encourage all of you use the collar I bought and seek out this reputable, honorable businessperson."
4,Your dog will have much better behavior,"After about a month with this Innotek collar, my dogs behavior issues have gone to almost zero. It get your dogs attention, even at a distance and reminds them that they are to listen to you. At this point, I occasionally use the tone but never have to use the stimulation. Highly recommended."
2,"Remote trainer, good ideas, poor execution.","This trainer works ok. The transmitter is better than the two other Innotek ones that I have owned.The part I don't care for is the collar. It has a clasp like a belt instead of the quick snap collars that they used to have and it is very stiff. I feel like it is almost choking the dog to put it on. Once on it is fine.The other problem is that the LEDs on the collar are so dim that unless you are staring at the collar in low light you cannot tell if the collar has been activated or not (I have little high frequency hearing and cannot hear the beep).The charger is nice, but it should include the transmitter, or what is the point?My dog does not respond to it as well as the previous Innotek collar either."
5,Mambo Fever,What a great CD.. From the first time I put it in my cd player I danced and remembered good ol times. I also played it at a party and it was a hit. Not stop Jams and what a great beat. I also bought the rest of the Music of Cuba Collection and was not disapointed. I will be sharing this collecion with all my friends.
1,What a disappointment!!!,"Cuban MamboThis is not what it seems. It is a regular CD not a SACD. Besides, do not be misled by the ""various artists"" label, into believing it contains original versions of the selections. All selection are by the same rather unknown Orquesta Raiz Latina. I am very disappointed I bought this item. I was misled by the specification of this product in Amazon's page."
3,The harsh reality,"This subwoofer kicks fine but if you wanna FEEL your bass this is not for you, the bass rings in your ear rather than rumble your body. Even on a ministereo (panasonic) it distorts badly when you turn up the volume. I ordered a different subwoofer the next day!Take my advice, this sub will hurt your ears more than it will entertain you. Consider something else."
1,Response to gary Kessler,"This is a response to Mr. Kessler's review. First, he needs to state that he has a biased interest in his review, that he used to work with Walter at Hill & Associates before he went to work for Juniper. Second, I was the reviewer for the first edition of the book and Walter had a lot of misconceptions about SONET in the original draft. So much so that my name is menitioned in the acknoweldgements in the first edition. Since I worked as a manager dealing with SONET at both AT&T as well as Cisco Systems,the book leaves a lot to be desired. He is very verbose in his writing style and has never worked in the field to give the reader a real understanding of the issues that come with understanding SONET - both services and equipment. There are other books in the field that do a better job - Andy Reid is a good one from the technical side for example - but this author needs to change his writing style and tone it down for this book to be considered for readership seriously."
3,Good Book To Start Sonet Studies,"This is very good book for beginners, and for those who wants to understand Sonet basics, but still it very general and lacks from some shallowness.So for designers and network operators it will be not so useful since it's not detailed enough."
2,this is not your book if you want hardcore technical details,"I can recommend this book to everyone who wants to get an overview on SDH/SONET capabilities and/or products but does not care for the protocol itself.But if you're looking for a good and correct description of the inner workings of the protocol you'd better not waste your time with this book. Check out the SDH/SONET bible: Broadband Networking: ATM, SDH and SONET by Mike Sexton and Andy Reid. It's expensive, but it's really worth the money.Goralski's book doesn't keep up with the promises of it's blurb. it has, like every book, some technical errors in it; errors which are IMHO worse enough not to buy this book. i wonder how this pointer-processing-example came into this book - horrors!..."
5,A bedtime favorite!,"My best friend and I loved the Richard Scarry books when we were little. My friend gave this book to my daughter(then 2) for her birthday and it has become a fast favorite over the year. She never tires of Mr Frumble's silly antics, and continues to plead for ""just one more!"" until we often finish all of the stories in the book. We love to look at all the wonderful details included in the pictures and point out funny things. She is now a big Frumble fan and I'm looking for more of his books for her now."
3,Not the real richard scarry,"Poor undetailed art based on the poor cartoon, but my 4 year old son loves it!"
3,"1"" Stencis O.K.","Not as well made as I first thought, the webbing is sometimes very thin at some spots if not careful could break."
4,Warm and Cool,Warm and Cool being a studio album by Tom Verlaine and is an experimental rock album that was originally released in 1992 and was reissued in 2005. The booklet is quite sparse with no photographs and not a list over whom plays what. This was yet another album that I picked up at my local library and had no prior knowledge whom Mr Verlaine was prior to listening to this. A very pleasent surprise indeed. 4/5.
1,Boring,"Probably a good work-out, but the poor interpretation of some really good songs is genuinely pathetic. After 15 minutes wejust couldn't take it anymore...no one should be allowed to dothat to a good piece of music."
1,Prime Product Chrome Heavy Duty Fan,"Fan had to be hard wired, has a high pitched whine, vibrates a lot. Only hardware was 3 wood screws. Fan is heavy duty. Wish I had my money back."
3,Effective but noisy,"I mounted two of these in my motorhome - they do a good job of moving air. However, they are very loud - one much louder than the other - and the fan blades were striking the grill after I installed one and I had to bend the blades around to get it to stop. They come on a swivel head, which is very hard to adjust - and the on/off switch is similarly rigid. In a motor home, they have to be mounted upside down (under a cabinet) which results in the logo being upside down - not that it matters much. This is a pretty heavy duty fan, and I value them - just too bad that they're only a little off from being perfect if they adjusted easier and didn't make so much noise."
5,6th CD!,"I went home this weekend and look what I picked up! The 6th ablum by Mr. Keith Lockhart and the Boston Pops! Great CD, love the music selections that Keith made to put in this one and I loved the Long Live the King! A Slaute to Elvis. You haven't heard anything until you have heard a full orchestra play Elvis Presley music. Number six, and it was great! My favorite piece is DoddleTOWN Fifers, or whatever it is called. The MCV (Middlesex County Vouleenters) are great, and I'm not just saying that because I know Earl, the Music Master for the group, they are good."
3,Pretty good,"This album is ok but no big deal. It's not the greatest punk comp. Cd in the world but it's fun and it's [inexpensive], so I say buy it if it's the only punk comp in the store (I even saw this one at [my local store]). I think they should start putting live tracks on Punk O Rama CDs, but hey that's just me. Personally I've always preferred ""Fat Music For Fat People"" Or ""Lookout Freakout"" better. But like I said it's fun and if you have [money] to burn I say get it, unless you can get your hands on a Fat Music or Lookout Freakout CD."
3,Not just for being cheap.......,Ok let's admit it ....this is not the greatest punkorama..maybe the guys behind this movement had a lack of effort choosing the songs....the NOFX song it's awesome but an unreleased song would be OK....oh yeah...this album lacks of unreleased material...just an unreleased song from guttermouth that it's quite funny instead of hard rocking.....but it's cool....and we gotta admit that it's not a great album....but Sum 41 it's not worth 10 times better that this punk 0 rama like a poser england dude named eddy wrote in this review section...estamos....ok
3,ok but ive heard better,"hey i bought this cd to add to my collegtions this was kind disapointing but it kept punk o ramas roots with awsome nofx,rancid,pennywise songs,dkm,guttermouth but the probal is some of it is like techno are like british pop punk its okbuy this for your collection"
1,NOT a 9000 Pulsonic Replacement Foil,"I ordered the 9000 Pulsonic Replacement Foil after reading a lot of negative comments on the newer 70S / 7000 Replacement Foil here on Amazon. When my replacement foil arrived it was the 70S / 7000 Replacement Foil instead of the 9000 Replacement Foil I'd specifically ordered (and paid more for - only a few dollars but still).As I live abroad, it's now pointless trying to send it back, wait for it to be delivered to the seller and then have another foil sent back, with the strong possibility that it'll be the same foil anyway.Buyer beware - you may not be getting actually what you asked for. If you can, buy one in a store where you can actually see that it is a 9000 Replacement Foil!"
2,Disappointed,"After having an earlier model Braun shaver that I loved, the Series 7 (790cc) shaver was a big disappointment from a features & ergonomic perspective. The biggest let down was the Pulsonic 9000 Series Foils (with the blades made by Gillette). These simply do not last or stay sharp anywhere near as long as the older Braun foils. Mine typically get noticeably dull within a matter of weeks (and not the months that are claimed) ... and I do not have a heavy or tough beard. I will not buy another Braun shaver (or the foils that go in them) again in the future."
5,Father's Day Package,We recently gave the Braun 700 Series Razor to my husband as a Father's Day Gift. Of course he has not used the replacement head yet but he loved his gift and loves his new razor. He used his new razor for the first time this morning and said it was the best he's had.
5,Braun Shaver repair head,Braun Replacement Pulsonic 9000 Series FoilI recently purchased this new shaver head through Amazon. The product order was correct and it was delivered on time.. I now get a very good shave with this new replacement head. I would recommend this product this product to anyone using a 9000 series Braun shaver.
2,Braun Replacement Pulsonic Head Series 9000,"I used to own the older style Braun Foil shaver similar to the 360 series that is reviewed in Consumer Reports and is top rated. I got moved into this product through the slick advertising by Braun that appeals to techies like me, thinking that anything that vibrates at supersonic speed must be better. Wrong! The older style foil head gives a faster, closer shave and is much preferred by me. Now I have a Pulsonic shaver with two heads that I don't really find very satisfying. Replacing this 9000 series head every 18 months, per Braun's recommendation, is not cost effective for the user. It doesn't cut any closer than the old one.Considering a Braun shaver? Try the older style 360 series."
5,close shave,I used the replacement on my pulsonic razor and it works as well as when it was new nice close shave for an electric razor..
5,Braun Replacement Foil,This is a replacement foil for the Braun electric razors. The foil is replaced on a yearly basis and maintained by the use of the Braun Lemon Scented razor maintanance / Cleaning Solution.
5,Pulsonic Replacement Foil and Cutterblock,This is the genuine article to restore like new performance to your Braaun Pulsonic. Local price is up to $43 so Amazon is a great way to save some cash.
2,Careful when ordering!,"Hi, I ordered this particular item from a third party seller (Senneca River) because I wanted the replacement head with the ""blue"" strip and as shoppers of this item probably know the newer version of this does not have that and apparently has some issues. Well despite this picture of this item showing the blue strip, what arrived was the newer version of the head that does NOT have the strip. Haven't tried it out yet but I am pretty disappointed that what was pictured was not what was shipped to me."
2,Not happy,"I purchased a replacement foil for this shaver about a year ago from a different seller and it ""Pulsonic"" on the head (as in the photo) I was thoroughly pleased with my purchase. I recently purchased another foil, but from a different seller and thought I was getting a ""Pulsonic"" brand item. It has ""Series 7"" on the foil and I am getting extremely poor and irritating shaves. I would not but from this seller again."
5,good deal,good item for the money works well I would reamend this product and seller I get a good shave this is the new 9000 series
4,As Advertised,"I had wanted to replace the foil on my razor for months, but kept on reading about how the replacements were nothing like the original foils sold with the Braun electronic razors. But, after a couple of months of the old foil pinching and pulling, i read some of the reviews on here, and gave in and bought this one. Have no fear, this is just like the original foil and the razor is as good as new."
5,Braun Replacement Pulsonic 9000 Series Foil and Cutterblock,A must have when your old cutter gets dull. Very good quality product. Thanks braun.
1,Disappointed,"After having only used the 9595 for 9 months with TLC, the silver front ""Pulsonic"" fell off foil and cutter cassette and cannot be put back on. Naturally not covered under 2 year warranty. Disappointed in this workmanship. My hubby loves the razor."
1,Braun 9000 series shavers,"The prices on the Braun accessories are about as good as I could find on the 'net.The 9000 series are advertised as a significant improvement over previous models. I do not see a significant difference.I still get a faster, closer shave from my old 2000 series Braun shaver."
3,depends........,"It's the entire Def Jux video collection on DVD which is cool but I was hoping there would be more extras like live performances, or anything else really. I was also hoping for some new videos, they've released Deep Space 9mm, The Horror, and 3 Card Molly on several other projects too, so for people who already have the majority of their catalog you've seen those videos, plus 90% of the other ish on here if not all of it. The Aesop Rock videos are the highlights of this DVD, plus it has a Hangar 18 video which was dope. If you consider yourself a Jukie then I'd suggest buying this, otherwise check out Revenge of the Robots it's better than this one."
1,Don't bother!,Reapplied multiple times in my shower and every time this basket just fell to the floor! Did not matter if I had a small or large bottle of shampoo/conditioner. Useless.
4,Excellent ideas on how to finish a quilt elegantly.,"As a beginner, I found that Mimi Dietrich book very helpful to teach how to finish a quilt. She presents several methods which are fully detailed and easy to follow. A must for every quilter."
4,"Some very useful tip, but...","Some very useful tips, but all you can see in the cover is all you can find in the book. Not very ""creative"", but a helpful monography in binding you quilt."
4,Binding made easy.,This book helped me with the binding on my quilt. It was very informative. I would recommend this book to anyone who was looking for help in binding their quilt. It has many different ways to do this.
4,Binding Help,"My least favorite part of quilting is bindings. This book was recommended and it does have a not of different ideas about bindings. It gives instructions about praire points; regular bindings, etc and has good instructions (step by step) how to do. Purchasing from an off Amazon vendor was not problem at all and I had never done this before. Amazon takes care of it all and informs you about the progress every step of the way. Hurray Amazon"
4,"Good information, even with editing flaws.","This information is very helpful. Important considerations are often repeated which reinforces them. Editing is poor, with several words spelled incorrectly and a few typos."
2,Disappointing.,"I wanted so much more from this book. I felt that the information contained was mainly common sense, and the writing seemed to be aimed toward a small child. Not only that, but the quality of this print is pretty bad - cheap paper and binding. There are so many better books out there, with creative and innovative techniques described that WORK. My kitties required that I try another title: ""Is Your Cat Crazy?: Solutions from the Casebook of a Cat Therapist"" by John C. Wright. I found this title to be much more helpful.I gave this book two stars because a child might benefit from it, or even just someone who simply has not spent much time around cats."
4,"Good Owners, Bad Habits","All in all, a fantastic book! I have recommended this book to tens of people already ... if you want clear, common sensical and effective ways of (re)training your kitty or want to understand why your cat is peeing in your bed/lounge/laundry ... then this is the book for you. Yes, it is written in a simple, good natured way, but if you are actually willing to put to work the advice given, it is a god-send. This is not a book for people who want a quick-fix, sell me a pill type solutions!! All the recommendations in here work - I have two living examples - but they all take some effort and time ..."
1,I'm sure this book is helpful for general cat problems....,"I'm sure this book is helpful for general cat problems, but it did not help mine. My 2 yr old cat has been peeing on laundry, clothes and bedding for a year. I bought this book in desperation to find a solution. The cat peed on the book. Guess she had something to say!"
3,"Lots of Markers, not lots of colors","This large set of markers would be fun for children who like having lots of choices, or for a group of kids to share while they work on projects at the same time.For my purposes, though, I was not very impressed. Besides the fact that the colors are not very colorful, and the actual hues do not warrant having so many pens. Some markers' colors do not match the actual color of the marks they make, and some markers make virtually indistinguishable marks, although the pens themselves are colored differently.Also, one reason why I purchased this set was to use the gray markers. I wanted to do some monochromatic studies using just gray tones--three would have been enough. Unfortunately, it was not possible to use the grays like a simple grayscale, because the grays were not ""neutral""--some had a ""bluish"" tint, others had a ""warmer"" tint. Fortunately, though, the set is not expensive, and I can donate it to a pre-school or something."
4,Wonderful!,As a mom it is a must to buy everything washable and these markers are just that. I am very impressed with the amount of markers and variety of colors available. My daughter loves them.
5,Best Markers I have ever used!!!,"I got these markers at target for $6. They are very smooth and easy to use, washable, and great for younger kids. I made a color sample sheet and the colors are all different, contrary to other reviews. They don't bleed through paper, unless you color in the same spot for 10 minutes. The scented markers are really cool and make you hungry! Great product and I would recommend them to anybody!!!"
5,I love coloring :),"These markers are amazing. I love the multitude of colors and they are such good quality. Being 28 years old, I have way too much fun with them :)"
5,Excellent,"This rendition of Daphne, recorded live at La Fenice in 2005, is an excellent live recording sure to please fans of June Anderson who turns in a remarkable performance. As the reviewer in Opera magazine noted at the time, ""The performance seemed to me an absolute triumph for June Anderson. At a career stage where she could reasonably be expected to scale down effort, ambition and new projects, she has instead taken the admirable decision to continue expanding her artistic range .... [T]he singing offered countless ravishments: crystalline timbre, clean-cut line-delineation, dead-on-target intonation, awesomely easy projection of one perilously exposed high phrase after another."" I highly recommend this recording."
3,I would have to agree on the Self Advertising,"I would have to agree with the other review regarding Sub-Zero. This whole book is blatant self-adverising. I wouldn't say it's horrible, but if you are looking for more than just ideas for kitchens, this book isn't for you. All of their advice is centered on using their products."
1,This pan is no bargain,The pan that I received was not a nonstick pan. It was uncoated and everything sticks to it. If you ever see this pan on sale at amazon don't buy it.
2,Packaging leaves a lot to be desired,"When the item arrived without any packaging protection, loose in a brown envelope, it was damaged. Rather than go through the hassle of returning and reordering and possibly getting the same problem back a second time, I repaired it myself. Not very happy with the unprotected packaging on a plastic item. I hope it was broken in shipment and not direct from the supplier..."
1,Useless if it doesn't stay plugged in,"Got this because it was a 3 way splitter that didn't have long cables and I thought the battery checker would be a nice feature. However it constantly pops out or falls out of the outlet with nothing plugged into it. Never stays in once you start plugging devices to it. Makes the whole unit useless if you have to hold it in with one hand while driving.I tried it on the back outlet in my car just to see if I could use it there for trips, but it doesn't stay in there either. I tried it on a couple of my friend's cars to see if they could use it, but same problem, it keeps falling out very easily...so I can't even give this thing away.Also the plug part is pretty long, so it sticks out quite a bit.Skip this and get something else."
2,a little top heavy,"I purchased this product because I wanted to connect my XM, Cell phone and GPS at the same time. It became a little top heavy, and so every time I hit a bump, it browned out, so I had to keep resetting my XM. It became annoying, so I eventually just plugged the XM in on it's own."
2,broken,"This item worked okay, the main problem was that it arrived broken in the packaging. I was able to fix it by superglueing it back together, none the less, it broke again.Construction was weak at best. It now resides in a landfill somewhere, and I'm not buying another."
5,Horse flag a success,"I bought this as a gift. Thr recipient really seemed to like it. It installed easily and seems to funcion correctly. Seems sturdy and was just like the picture.; I would recommend this item, and buy again."
4,Very good Stereo clock radio,"I was looking for a decent sounding bed side alarm clock radio.Compared Bose, Boston Accoustics and Cambridge soundworks 740.This stereo met my expectation, Stereo sound greatI can listen to all my mp3 burned on CDs.5 stars to JandR, ordered through amazon.com one day, delivered the next day on the regular 4-7 shipping day"
2,Not happy with the bass,This stereo would be great if it wasn't for the fact that the bass is far too much and can't be turned down.
3,Just OK,"This was rated the best of all the machines in this type. I cannot get the MP3 player to work with my CDs. Perhaps I have to make new CDs and format them in a manner agreeable with the TEAC. Also, the reciever is just OK for the tight valley I live in, so I get a background full of static.Still, it has strong sound, the timer brings up commercial CD or tuner stations on-time. I miss a buzzer, but I will know I am late when the music goes off automatically."
1,Stylish... but not good...,"I just bought this unit and use it for a couple of days. Nowdays is hard to find a good portable radio CD with a good look and style. But in the vey first minute I begun to miss certain functions:-When out of current; all presets and clock adjunt will be missing...-The display never turns off...-No RDS, so it is not possible to read the radio station name...-And bass is extremelly bad and present when listening the radio, it is OK with most CD reproduction. Not possible to reduce...-No batteries, only AC.-When oppening the CD door, the looks is just black plastic...Quite a bad product..."
3,"dissapointing errors, no errata","I just started reading and already found two wrong quiz answers and two questionable ones. Unfortunately it may reflect actual ARE experience, but for a learner it may be just a time lost. There are better sources for ARE preparation. I recommend ALS/Kaplan courses and The Architect's Handbook of Professional Practice instead. No errata for this book is published at the publisher's webpage http://ppi2pass.com. No way to report errors, simply because there is no such a book on the expandable list at http://ppi2pass.com/ppi/PPIInfo_pg_Errata-errataform.html."
5,Passed!,"Due to the material presented in this guide, I was able to pass my exams. I studied this almost exclusively."
2,Just not quite,"The labels don't stick well and I didn't like the design, though I should have looked more carefully. What's attractive is so very personal, even for labels."
5,Incredible,"One of the best metal albums I've ever heard. Amazing production, insane rhythms, incredible guitar work"
5,This album makes me feel like my soul is eating chocolate cake!,this album is absolutely amazing. it is one of my all time favorite albums (from any genre) highly recommended for fans of almost all modern death metal.
5,Gag gift,"Bought these as a gag gift, they worked fine for that. Haven't used them but it was a funny gift!"
2,Not what I expected,"They tasted great, but he could barely feel it because the latex is so thick. Plus, the tastes lasts as long as cheap bubble gum, not long at all."
5,Its great,I like this memory stick its let my store about 1350 picture in my sony T1 camera in 5 MB.
3,fun for astrology lovers,This book has been a favorite of mine. Sexy descriptions and cute generalizations of the basic sun signs. I suggest you read their moon sign as well to get the whole personality.
2,Bizzare,"I would never live my life according to what the stars say. I read this book out of curiosity and I laughed so hard my stomach hurt. The stars certainly don't know what my husband likes or dislikes, according to this book, I married the wrong man(even though I've been married for many years). this book is a joke!"
2,The book is worth a laugh,"I read this book and was not impressed. I have taken many astronomy classes and I have always been curious of all the different star signs, so I thought I would really like this book. I didn't, I thought it was totally stupid and this is why- This book claims that by looking at the stars, you can tell what kind of man is right for you, what he wants in bed, how he likes his women and things he won't tell you. Onl;y a total idiot believes this!. If you want to know what your man likes or what he wants in bed, you ask him! If I would have taken any advise from this book, I wouldn't be in the great commited relationship that I'm in. Of course I'm still very much interested in the stars, I'm just not willing to live my life according to what this author thinks the stars know."
1,throw in the towel,nothing outstanding but lil romeo really saved his dad's career this just does'nt interest me lil boy 14 and got his own crib damn even michael jackson was'nt blinging like that. still I hate this cd sorry remakes and the guest stars does'nt make it better.
1,Sellout time.,This is a fine example of the lenghts master p is willing to go inorder to make more money.This cd is worthless because it is just old remakes of old songs.Since its a master p production it has to feature dozens of other artists to help it sell.This kid doesnt even write his own lyrics and cant even rap.Even the garbage can deserves better garbage than this.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOUR AN INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEING.
1,Lame Rhymes is more like it!,Lil Romeo is by far the worst rapper in the history of hip hop. Thank God though that everyone knows that execpt the little kids who buy his crappy albums. This is the kind of music that 6 year olds listen to. Real rap fans don't buy this garbage. I don't recomend this to anyone. This kid makes MC Hammer look like Big Pun. Hell I'd much rather listen to Hammer than this bubblegum trash.
2,Hard reading,"This is not an ""easy read"" if that's what you're looking for. Plan to spend some time trying to get into this book. Way too technical for what I was looking for."
5,Amazing album!!!,"When Phil Vassar's first single came on to my television, I didn't have any clue who he was. His second single, ""Another Day in Paradise,"" really made me stand up and take notice. I wanted to hear more from this artist so I bought his self-titled debut album. I instantly fell in love with his wonderful songs, my favorite by far is ""Rose Bouquet."" It wasn't until later that I realized that he was responsible for writing the hits of one of my favorite country artists, Jo Dee Messina. His writing, musical, and vocal talent are amazing. He is definitely a true musician in every sense of the word!"
5,My Favorite CD,I absolutely love this CD. I heard several of his tunes on the radio after moving to KY. I fell in love immediately. This man is so talented and I feel he's underated as a Country Singer. Such talent. It's so rare that I buy a CD and love every song on it. I can't wait until he makes another. I'm a fan for life!!
5,EXCELLENT SONG WRITER AND SINGER!,"I BOUGHT PHIL'S NEW CD AND WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE WORDS AND MUSIC. WHAT A ""KNOCKOUT"" FOR A FIRST RELEASE.HIS SONGS ARE EASY TO SING ALONG WITH AND BRING BACK LOTS OF MEMORIES. THE LYRICS BLEND SO SMOOTHLY WITH THE MUSIC AND PHIL'S VOICE DELIVERS THEM WITH TENDER, LOVING CARE.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK PHIL.....I'M READY FOR ANOTHER ONE."
5,Phil hasn't changed a bit,"Several years ago my wife and I frequented a small restaurant/club in Nashville named the Courtyard Cafe. We went every weekend to hear a young singer named Phil. He played covers of various popular songs (many times his version was much better than the original). We love to think that we ""discovered"" him before he made it big. His current album is further proof of his outstanding songwriting and performing skills."
5,Awsome singer,When I saw Phil Vassar's videos on CMT I was very impressed! He puts so much enthusiam into his music and his facial expressions say it all!! I recommend this CD to any one that loves country music.
5,Amazing Talent,"Phil Vasser has a great talent as a song writer, singer, and performer. This CD captures every aspect of it. From songs with a true deep meaning to song that are just meant to be fun. Recomended for everyone."
5,"WAITING ON ""SIX-PACK SUMMER""","I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT HOW MUCH I HAVE ENJOYED THIS CD. BUT SIX-PACK SUMMER REALLY TAKES ME BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL DAYS! SUCH A VARIETY OF MUSIC ON ONE CD. SOMETHING ME, MY HUSBAND AND KIDS ENJOY. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT RELEASE & VIDEO! EVERY SONG BRINGS BACK SOME KIND OF MEMORY...LOVE IT!"
5,One of my standard favorites,"I've owned this CD for quite awhile and it's in that set of CDs that I play regularly. The songs are upbeat, easy to sing along to, and good for the soul. I find myself smiling even if I was blue to begin with. Love it and Phil."
3,entertaining and thought-provoking - but hard to take seriously.,"I found this an interesting read. It discusses a wide range of topics, and even though he changes subjects very frequently within the same chapter, it was done with smooth transitions, as if part of a conversation, and it was easy to keep up. I think I would've taken the book much more seriously if I wasn't under the impression that he had developed a kind of obsession for one of the characters towards the end of the book, based on pure infatuation and manifested through the overuse of psychedelics, consequently ""experiencing"" wishful and hopeful delusions. I don't know what was the bigger tragedy in the book: her painful indifference towards him, or witnessing the author loose himself to the overuse of psychedelics. I wish him well.This was a very entertaining read, nonetheless. I very much enjoyed it, and read it in a short period of time because of that."
2,A wimper without any bang.,"Here's an author trying to make money by writting a book about ideas that other people have had; but the sum total is only equal to the parts. Mr Pinchbeck doesn't really have anything new to say, nor does he impart any real ""wow"" moments. In discussing mystical/spiritual ideas it is true that what we are trying to talk about is ""beyond words"", but words can point in the direction of the suchness if the speaker has really had an enlightenment experience. I don't think Mr. Pinchbeck has had that experence. He is lost in intellectualization; I would advise him to ""go back to the breath"". I do think he wants to make money by compiling what others have said about the topic. But even those he quotes extensively seem to be as lost as he is. A waste of money; without soul."
1,JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS!,"I love books on this type of subject.....except this one. It held my interest for the first few chapters, then it seemed to be just rambling episodes of psychedelic ""flashbacks"" that are passed off as communications with other beings from other dimensions. The author even admits that some of these episodes may be his own beliefs played out through the hallucinogen. I don't think one ""enlightened"" person mentioned in the book had ""higher"" experiences without the aid of some kind of hallucinogenic drug. I'm opened minded about the existence of UFO's, crop circles and aliens, other dimensions, etc., but this book in no way furthers my belief in any of those things. The author has obviously done way to much experimenting with psychedelics for this book to be taken as anything even close to credible."
3,What a long strange trip,"On the plus side, this is a head-spinner of an idea compendium. The bibliography has some cool stuff you've never heard of in it; some of Pinchbeck's drug trips are fascinating, and there are a few passages where you simply stop and say ""holy Jeez!""On the downer...Pinchbeck rambles, dumps all over science he clearly doesn't understand, and massively overgeneralises (e.g. Hinduism and Buddhism, although sharing a few common concepts like karma, are quite different). Some assertions simply beggar belief-- how exactly is it that extrasolar civilisations communicated in ""thought waves"" with the ancient Maya-- and Pinchbeck makes more than a few wild leaps.Pinchbeck should have written this as a novel. Then the irritating ""is it true?"" questions that he raises and can't answer wouldn't get in the way of a good story.But overall, very stimulating."
1,Not a keeper,"I thought for a bout the first 150 pages the book was heading toward a grand synthesis, but it became clear in the second 150 it never had been, and morphed into completely egocentric mush. I wish I had not bought it."
2,very strange,some parts i did find interesting. other parts were very hard to follow. a lot of it seemed to be the ramblings of a drug addict who used drugs as an excuse in the name of research. he also tried to justify cheating on his spouse as free love type of crap.
2,"All over the place, and nowhere at all","Had high hopes for this based on his 2012 documentary and Breaking Open the Head, but I honestly can't see how this even got published. It's just all over the place. Just like the previous reviewer said, it's like he took out a bunch of note cards and through them up in the air and just went through them in no particular order. With so many better books on this subject matter, give this one a miss. Trust me, you're missing nothing here. Unless you like your books to read like William Burroughs cut ups, skip this one."
2,Chaotic,"GOOD PART: Interesting material. Good references. When Daniel convey ideas of others, not so bad.BAD PART: Little focus. Scrambled. Drug experience was more disgusting than enlightening. When Daniel elaborates his personal life, and drug experiences, not so good."
3,What a trip!,"Pinchbeck is certainly well read. I loved that he quoted Jean Gebser liberally in this book. (Gebser's ""The Ever-Present Origin"" is among the most brilliant books ever written. Pinchbeck also quotes my favorite philosopher, Ken Wilber.)I don't think the world will ever attain ""nondual cosmic consciousness"" be it 2012 or whenever. (It would be nice, however.) His accounts of ""fungal consciousness"" and other drug trips were interesting and cautionary. I plan never to try any of this stuff (hey, I'm a mom...children depend on me) even if it would lead to moments of gratuitous enlightenment.Still, I'll be a wee bit nervous in December 2012!"
1,PARADIGM GRIFT...urr...sorry...SHIFT,"After reading the overblown hyperbole of the 'product description' and letting the gag reflex settle down I have to say for the record I cannot believe so many people are taken in by this grifter whose angle is directly aimed at the visionary,ayahuasca,2012 crowd.It is so clearly a case of the Emperor's New Clothes with Pinchbeck determined to create himself a new age empire.You think not? This quote from Pinchy himself on RealSanInc...'We aren't charging for this and I ask that you buy my old book and soon,my new one...FREQUENTLY' Obviously Daniel is not yet to enter the new paradigm until he's milked the old one dry.Do not support this crass commercialisation of spirituality,prophecy and the desire for transcendence.I'd call him McKenna lite but that would be an insult to Terence.READ ALL ABOUT THE PARADIGM GRIFT OF THE NEW MILLENIA![...]"
2,Vital Infromation or the Ravings of a Drug Addled Lunatic?,"I picked this book up wanting to expand my understanding of the Mayan calendar and the significance of the year 2012. While I read some fascinating insight into certain beliefs and/or interpretations of the Mayan calendar system, what I mostle got was the stories of the author's use of psychedelic drugs.While some of the material here is very informative and thought provoking, this is much more the tale of the author's own drugged out journey to what he feels is his own enlightenment.From stories about speaking with shamanistic gods, to being taunted by ""daimons"", there is far too much selfish writing in this book, and it honestly takes away from Pinchbeck's credibility. After a while you get tired of reading about yet another trip the author was on and what it meant to him."
1,Don't waste your time,"2012 has little to do with the year 2012. Instead, this book is all about Daniel Pinchbeck's arrogant view of the world around him and his intolerance for people who believe in God (which last time I checked included over 90% of Americans.) For four chapters I wasted my time reading about his psychedelic research (they have a name for this - it's called drug addiction - get help!!) and his self proclaimed superior intellect. At one point he even claimed to be the only person capable of interpreting the happenings around 2012.Don't waste your time!!"
1,what a mess,what a mess of ego and rampant over intellectualizing and misogeny and ...confusing and just so not worth the effort.
2,A lengthy tome that drags,"After about the first third of the book, Pinchbeck just couldn't hold my interest. HIs discussion of alien phenomenon was just too hard to digest and I had to stop. If you're a die-hard Pinchbeck fan and you really believe in the notion of UFO's, the supernatural, magical crop circles and stuff like that, you'll love this book.Also, my mother-in-law read this and had to stop about 2/3 in because of some very anti-feminist rhetoric featured in the book. Apparently Pinchbeck is a bit of a sexist. Or so she felt by his writing."
1,This book is not about 2012,"It's all about the author and his wild experiences tripping on shrooms in the Amazon and hating the chicks who dumped him. If you're buying this because you're interested in 2012, give it a pass. If you're a fan of deluded and arrogant autobiographies, I change my review to 5 stars."
1,how did it get published?,The adult drug induced ramblings of an abused child. How in the world did it get published? Give the purchase price to feed someone.
5,A Book Worth Reading...Even After The Use-By Date On The Cover.,"For those expecting another ""Breaking Open The Head""...don't.But I really enjoyed reading it,even if at times I wondered where it was heading.I can see that it won't speak to everyone who reads it...or attempts to read it,but if the ideas speak to you like they did to me,then you will really savor the experience.All I can say is don't come to it with any expectations,just read it for what it is,and then maybe you won't be disappointed.I'll be coming back for a second read later,for sure."
3,2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl,"This is a heavy topic -- more a textbook than a story. I detect a built-in, left-wing bias but still worth reading."
2,Nicely written but.......,This book is nicely written and interesting. I agree that there are things going on that we do not understand. I do agree that something will happen in 2012 as far astrological alignments are concerned. Whether or not they are for the good or bad. That is to be determined. I personally think this author has done too much acid. This book as nothing really to do with Quetzalcoatl at all. He talks primarily about crop circles and his relationship with his childs mother going down the drain due to drugs. I think this book is his own healing process.
2,Conundrum City,"Here is a remarkable author who is probably smarter than 99 percent of the world, who has bravely participated in adventures than 99 percent of the world would run from, who has a vocabulary larger than 99 percent of the world... and yet who writes a book that gives 99 percent of readers nothing to hold on--it's as if Pinchbeck is so enamored of his own brain that he feels all he has to do is regurgitate whatever's inside without metaphor, simile, explanation, guide--without anything at all--that might say to the reader, ""Yes, I know this is tough stuff, and I want to help you through it."" It's a crying shame, because there are so many extraordinary ideas, intelligent asides, and excellent theories in here that should reach the general public as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, until the author is more kindly disposed toward his readers, his work is simply too inaccessible. I wish and hope that some generous editor or friend could step to the plate and help him."
4,"A thick thinker, intriguing","This is a very interesting book, but people looking for an easy read with simply-constructed theses should look elsewhere. Pinchbeck approaches his writing as serious science and the text is thick with philosophy, psychology and more.The theories advanced by Pinchbeck are mostly collected theories of others who came before him, enhanced by his own experiences with psychodelics. Some of it will be scoffed at by people who have made up their minds about the way things are and Pinchbeck both acknowledges this and expects it.Early in the book, he turns these people on their heads and sweeps them aside, inviting the curious and those readers with a will to think about things beyond the way they have been explained, beyond the way we are most comfortable with, to read on.Do I buy what Pinchbeck is selling? Some of it, sure. Some of it seems a stretch, but some of it is intriguing. Don't buy this book looking for alternative answers, buy it if you're looking for a thinker."
2,Singularity of consciousness exposed!,"Daniel, you bailed to South America with the ""First Princess"" because your ""Partner's"" anger about the possible link between your ""Book Research"" and your child's developmental disabilities was in your view ""Disproportionate"". From the outside it appears that the only singularity in this volume is your runaway ego. The second star is for some really exceptional (and unfortunately wasted) use of prose, but the three that got away got away with the awareness you traded for your taste of the ""noosphere"". Clean up and go home."
1,Easily one of the worst books I ever read,The man has a god complex and basically only talks about himself and how his drug trips are better than your drug trips. I felt like he was talking down to me the whole time. I read a good chunk and I could not even finish it. Garbage.
2,Lacks much information on 2012,"After reading and liking Daniel Pinchbeck's first book, ""Breaking Open the Head"", and liking it, I was looking forward to this book. However this book seemed like reading the author's diary and more about his personal trials than about 2012 prophsies. It never seemed to get to the point of what the 2012: The Return was supposed to mean. There are much better books on this subject. Not recommended for those looking for Mayan prophecy."
1,It's not 2012. It is 1960,"I am not here to tell you if this is a good or a bad book. You have many other reviews for that. I am here to tell you only one thing: if you want to read about the year 2012 and all the events that might happen on this year, THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT BOOK. The author keeps telling you about his own experiences with this or that drug, in this or that country. So, for 2012 information, look somewhere else."
1,A waste of time,"Thank goodness I took this book out of the library instead of spending money on it, because it was truly a waste of time. Simply put: his thesis is extremely weak and his ideas are moronic."
5,Multiple use product,I purchased this product to place on the rear bumper of travel trailer so that I could attach a bike carrier. I gave it 5 stars because it was an easy install and it works very well. Would recommend this product for anyone trying to accomplish this task or possibly attaching a grill or cooler rack.
5,This is the best Trailer Bumper Mount,This is the best Trailer Bumper Mount. It fit perfectly. Mounted easily. VERY VERY well made. Finish is awesome. Buy this one. =)
5,Very versitile for mounting to RV / Trailer,This is a very well built mount. Very easy to install. I bolted it to the square rear bumper of my travel trailer to mount my 4-bike rack. Setup has worked very well. Can be mounted over or under bumper. Very stronger and high quality.
4,Perfect!,Helps solve my carrying space. Allows me to add extra space to my bumper. Can be used for various attachments.
4,poor fit on bumper hitch,The hitch I purchased did not fit over the bumper of my camper very well. The fact that the bumper has a 14 guage covering of chrome diammond plate steel changes the dimensions of the bumper. I have had to enlarge the bolt holes so the bolts will clear the diamond plate covering. Not a hard chore for someone who works with steel on a daily basis. Over all the workmanships of the hitch is good and is even with the minor alteration a good product.
5,Fabulous! One of the best books I have ever read!,"This book has to be to date one of the best, if not the best, book I have ever read- it is so outstanding! It brings you through a woman's life and how she changes and creates change in the world around her. It makes you see through the eyes of someone else about aging and the things your mother tells you about life and disregard. You experience it through this woman! I cannot say enough how wonderful this book is- a definite keeper!"
5,Siddons has me hooked!,"I have not read many of Siddons' books, but this one has made me a fan. It took awhile to get into the story. I was getting restless until about a hundred pages in, then I couldn't put it down. Get out the tissues! As a mother and grandmother, it is easy to see how fragile relationships can go awry. The story has so many facets that a woman can relate to: indifferent husbands, temptation, difficult in-laws, being removed from your roots, spoiled children, loss of loved ones. I look forward to reading more of her books."
2,Its not the book...its the abridged version that's the problem,"I'm a big Anne Rivers Siddons fan and I purchased this without realizing it was the abridged version. I've listened to other books on tape in abridged form and usually, you might notice an inconsistency once or twice at the most. This version however, was just too abridged. Based on what I heard, I thought this is probably a wonderful book in its full form. But you couldn't get a sense of the characters from this version and some characters, you never even heard from until the end. It was wierd, choppy...made little sense.I can't recommend the unabridged text but I bet I would love it and would recommend it if I read it. I won't recommend this version however. Whomever decides what should be left in and what should be left out did a really lousy job."
3,Wonderful,This is one of my favorite books of all times. Spans the life of a woman from late teens to old age and does it beautifully. A must read and a keeper!
1,maybe I read the abridged version,"I kept reading this book thinking I would eventually understand why she loved her husband, or going to the colony, or anything. It never became clear. I'm thinking that perhaps I read the abridged version since this story was just a mass of disasters happening one right after the other, with no real reason shown for why the main character had such passion for the people and the places in her life.If you want to read this book, make sure you get the full version. All these great reviews must come from somewhere."
1,Not AT ALL like Pat Conroy!,I read this book because the author was recommended if you like Pat Conroy's work ... that couldn't be farther from the truth! Pay Conroy's writing is so intriging with every wonderfully crafted sentence and paragraph. This book has the main character as a selfish I-married-rich woman who contributes nothing to society and is about as interesting as a rock. I felt it was a huge waste of time ... re-read some of Pat Conroy's work and save yourself the boredom found in the pages of Colony.
1,Colony,"I Loved the book, but when I got to the end part of the book was missing.I had to get another book from my bookclub to finish the book. It would have cost to much to return.Jonie"
4,Colony,"I read this book so many years ago & still remember it as such an enjoyable read. The characters, descriptions, everything seemed so real & alive in a long ago time. Pick it up & read it now!"
2,What's up with all those five star reviews?,"I bought this book on the basis of all those five star reviews. I kept reading thinking, ""certainly, just any minute, any page I'm going to get why people seem to have liked this book."" But no, page after page and I never got it. The people were unpleasant, shallow and drawn with cartoonish simplicity. The story hopped from decade to decade and was not well developed in any decade. The characters did not speak as much as they were described and the use of drippy, syrupy, damp, shimmering adjectives was cloying at best. The main character constantly ""just knew"" when something was about to happen, or had happened(in theory unbeknownst to her)--a device which quickly grew tiresome. I don't think any review could make me want to read another book by this author."
3,Colony,"I have always enjoyed Miss Siddons books, however this was not her usual type of story. Since I live in the lowcountry of South Carolina, perhaps it was the difference in setting, but this story did not grab my interest."
4,Colony,"This was a great read. The story begins when Maude is a young woman and artfully transitions between her youth and the present day in alternating scenes. As one follows Maude thru her life one begins to understand why certain decisions have been made that threaten the viability of the family even as they bring the family full circle. Maude's love of family, nature and tradition is seared into the fabric of this New England family. Totally entertaining."
3,The Warlocks pumps their psychadelic sound on steroids,"'Surgery' basically takes the fuzzed-out psychadelia of The Warlocks and pumps it up on steroids. Although their previous release 'The Phoenix Album' didn't stray from mind-bending stoner rock, the songs had some structure, the album was tight and cohesive. In contrast 'Surgery' focuses more on trippy repeating riffs, creating for a more sludgy, dense, amplified wall-of-sound. Just think Spacemen 3 meeting The Raveonettes, or early Stereolab meeting Jesus And Mary Chain, all with accompanying bursts of Pavement/MC5 feedback. Another comparison would be a more swirlier drugged-out Chapterhouse. But make no mistake, this is a Warlocks CD, from Bobby Hecksher's droning vocals to the thunderous double-drums, even adding a psychadelic whirlwind twist on 50's oldies. 'Surgery' continues to trip the light fantastic, but instead of with hallucinogenics, with high-voltage power."
5,Excellent in my 1988 Dodge B250 Van;/Motorhome,I changed the transmission fluid and used Dexron III since Mopar was not available and the shudder started. I then found out about this product from my brother and added it. The shudder was gone instantly. I would recommend this product to anyone who experienced similar problems. Apparently some transmission fluids are thinner than others and are missing something important which is included in this product. I love it.Lubegard Dr. Trannys Instant Shudder Fixx 2oz was a miracle cure for my troubles.
4,WORKS,Added this to my Mitsi Diamante and noticed the transmission is a lot smoother doing gear changes up and down.
5,Worked GREAT!!,"Very likely saved my Honda Odyssey! Very pleased with the ease of installation, and its effectiveness at solving the problem."
5,Trans Shudder Gone!!!,Used in my 2001 BMW 740iL that was having a considerable shudder problem. Instantly fixed it and have put still working like a champ after 8000 miles. Saved me thousands of dollars on a transmission rebuild! Great product!
4,Mostly works,"It seems to have mostly gotten rid of the shudder. However, it doesn't have the tranny purring like a kitten. It is definitely more aggressive as it shifts and on cold mornings it takes a while to warm up. But once it does warm up it runs nicely. Still better than the shudder."
1,"Sorry, no cigar","I put this in my 2000 Ford Expedition in hopes of curing my TC shudder. It completely cured the problem.... for about a week. Then the shudder came back as bad as ever. I really wanted it to work, but it just didn't"
5,Lovely jubbly,"Can't believe I waited so long to purchase, great writing and comedy never ages, still as funny today as the day it came out."
1,less than one star,this was horrible. i had heard them on the tv show 'rain shadow' and thought i was getting that kind of music. instead it's worse than a garage rock band. we actually threw it away.
3,Not the best one...,"This one was eaten, but not happily. They like salmon, but the greens thing in these florentines just don't tempt their appetites whatsoever. They do look like real people food when you open the can, however. They don't smell up your kitchen like most cat food does and honestly, the nutritional content of these varieties makes all of them worth a try. If you cat loves salmon, by all means try this one if nothing else, because of the nutritional value. But if they're so-so, you may opt for a less expensive variety. I do recommend these varieties very highly, however, because of their nutritional content, but we prefer the egg souffles in this house! :)"
3,the review,"Some good content. still relatively rough around the edges, but holds some sick jams, with some tight beats. i would recommend buying if you want to show off some underground flavour to your friends however doesn't hold enough for continous listening."
1,There is no code in there.,Dont buy if you need to learn plumbing in details. There is only general info in this book. Waste of money
1,Solar Spotlight 6-Led,"Bought this so I could keep a light on my ""Support Our Troops"" sign. Done everything the manual said to....lucky if I get 4 straight hours of light & then it is almost out. I gave it a (1) because it looks good but as for happy with it.......not @ all. I even tried a 2 days of charge & it didn't last 4 hours. Maybe they aren't for the N.E. But I see the folks across from me & down from me they all have solar lights & they work. Calling the company today could be I just got a lemon.......Good Luck"
3,a question of style,"I found the subject matter of Madison Smartt Bell's book very interesting. I would really like to be able to better understand Toussaint and the history of Haiti, that is why I read this second book on the subject. My problem is that I really don't care for the writing style of Mr. Bell. I found the many different views that one gets annoying and irritating. I also think that the story could of been told in a shorter and more straight to the point way. I am sure that many readers will get great enjoyment out of Madison Smartt Bell's book because the subject matter is fascinating, I did not."
4,Historical fiction at its finest,"I'd second what the other reviewers noted but would like to add that this is a follow-up to Bell's highly-praised All Souls Rising, also a masterful book about Haiti and one which first introduced many of these characters. The legacy of Toussaint is important for Haiti today, and this book gives valuable insights into today's world. The book can be a tough read--many of the descriptions of the atrocities are brutal--but is well worth the effort. Take time to read the timeline in the appendix and find out what happened after Toussaint's arrest."
5,The author sails to new horizons with Pinnacle Studio 9 Visual Quickstart Guide!,"I've read numerous technical books on many subjects and have never sailed through the software as smoothly as with this book.If you're looking for a tutorial that can whiz you through the subject matter with ease and accuracy this is it! No matter where you wish to refer back to, you can do it without reading the whole chapter (as with other tutorials). Quickstart is the name however I feel it should be named Quick referrence.Best investment I've made in a while. I'm making movies that are in awe at my office. I've been told they have been made professionally."
2,A Let-Down,"As noted by others, the DVD set includes only two discs, and includes only those previously unreleased cartoons noted above. It DOES NOT include the third ""bonus"" disc or any of the added cartoons. Since the DVD release is titled the same as the Blu-Ray, it seems to be rather deceptive marketing on the part of Warner Brothers."
5,Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume One [Blu-ray],"this is an amazing set, i am so happy i got this, the picture quality is just amazing,looks really good, i never thought it would look this good, there are a lot of extras ,documentaries and more, i highly recommend this set to any looney tunes fan, you will not regret it,this is something everyone old and young can really enjoy, looney tunes never dissapoints, plus theprice on amazon right now is awesome, i know everyone will like this"
2,Blu-Rayers have all the fun,"Excellent cartoons, but disappointing DVD release. While the Blu-Ray version of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection had tons of great extras, including a whole extra disc devoted to special features, this was just a two-disc bare bones set. Many of the cartoons have already been released on Golden Collections. Why not just release the ones never released before on DVD? I really hope the next classic Looney Tune DVD release is better than this."
5,&#128077;&#128077;,"Gift for my husband, who is a Hugh fan on our Platinum Anniversary, 20th . He was very surprised and excited. He could hardly wait to watch with our kids. &#128077;&#128077;"
5,LOONEY TUNES: PLATINUM COLLECTION VOL. 1 (Blu-ray),This collection is all that I wished for and more. I purchased it mainly to see Marvin the Martian in action. Great and along the way from disc to disc I was more than pleased. Some outstanding clips. A must see and own.
5,Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume One [Blu-ray],Bought this as a gift. i would recommend this to anyone who was into this type of stuff. They loved it.
4,Hi-Def Bugs!,"I'm pretty jazzed for this set. Ok, I already have most of them on prior sets, but they should look pretty nice in 1080p. I wonder how they will be framed on widescreen sets? Also, it does seem that these bluray sets will present the various shorts in a more logical manner (i.e. grouping all the Marvin ones together). I have always found it an exercise in frustration trying to find a particular cartoon on the six golden collection volumes."
2,No index screen,"I love these cartoons, and I always have. However, the Blu-Ray is a deep disappointment. There is no menu listing the cartoons on each disc. They are separated as chapters, but there's no way to find a specific cartoon without using fast-forward or chapter-skip.A Blu-Ray of shorts without random access? Don't skimp on something you're going to call ""Platinum!"""
4,"A good, but not great, book.","I recently learned that Doris Egan is Jane Emerson of City of Diamonds fame. Why did she write under different names? I don't know. But I check from time to time to see if she has written a followup to City of Diamonds and stumbled on this information and immediately ordered the Ivory series.I was pleasantly surprised, for a while. The book is very readable, which I consider to be very important. More important than ""what the book is about"" in most cases. I was immediately interested in the heroine and the people she was interacting with.But as the book went on, it began to meander quite a bit, with some major events that were barely explained. Also, the heroine's love-interest is very lightly developed and I found it hard to imagine them together.Overall, a fun ride - but not a great book. I'd recommend it for light read."
3,Didn't provide great reception,"We live just outside of Washington, DC and there are TV transmission antennae very close to our house. Despite that, the reception was not very good with this antenna."
2,It doesn't work well,"I am 20 miles north of San Francisco, but KRON 4 comes and goes. It doesn't pick up channel KNTV NBC which is in San Jose."
2,HDTV,I'm still out on this product. It has boosted the analog signal but at this time I still haven't been able to bring in a digital signal strong enough to get a picture and that's with a signal booster.
4,conection,"I haven't got the anteana hooked up yet. I wish it had said in the ad that it had to be connected outside. I'm a senior cit. and thought I could handle the instalation by myself but my son has to do it for me. Larger than I expected too , but that's not your fault. Right now I have it leaning in the window--works pretty god there but I'm sure it will be better when it gets installed right. I'm sure also that everything will be fine becaused I have never been disappointed with Amazon prods. thank you..."
4,Free TV in HD,"This antenna is capable of top notch HD reception, providing the signal paths are coming from one general direction. The ad says it is multi-directional, I tend to question that, because you still have to aim the face of the antenna toward the transmitting towers. There are web sites where you can download, and print out the signal directions where you live at. Nowhere on the box, nor in the manual says it is multi-directional. In my case, there are six signal paths, four of which come from the S.E, and two from N and NW, which effects the strength of the latter two signals, creating occasional dropouts in the sound and picture. If what I heard is true about the signals doubling in power output in Feb.09, this might correct my paticular problem hopefully."
4,Antennas Direct DB2,I mounted the DB2 in the attic and it has an excellent reception with station 35-40 miles away.
4,NIfty TV Antenna,"I bought this little antenna as a substitute for cable at my beach house, which is approximately 42 miles from the signal sources in Houston. It has performed quite well, even though I did not mount it on the roof. I can now receive two of the three major broadcast channels through the air, plus the public television station. The antenna was reasonably priced, very compact, and easy to install."
4,antenna,"I use this in an apartment.Live in bottom unit, and receive 21 channels.18 mi. from xmitters.Unit is aimed toward stations and laid flat on top of T.V no problems. Would recommend this unit."
5,Good Antenna,"Excellent equipment. Used a 6 ft. length of 1"" PVC and anchored it to my brick chimney, with the antenna mounted about 24"" above the chimney top, and the reception improved dramatically. I couldn't get CBS at all with my indoor antenna, now I get Hi Def on my 40"" LCD. I now get channels I didn't know were out there! Ran 75 ft. of R6 coax into my LCD, everything is great! Good product."
4,Not for Red Zone DTV,"I got this for Northern Virginia, about 20 miles from the DC broadcast towers. [...] says I need a medium directional antenna (red zone), which this is not. Although to me it seems highly directional, in that if I rotate it even a bit it has a dramatic impact on my reception. I have this in my attic, and can't get much of anything from DC well. I'm not saying it's a bad antenna, especially for the price, but if you go to [...] and it says to get a medium directional antenna for stations in the red zone, don't try to skimp and get a cheaper one not made for that challenge. You'll just end up like me having to go out and buy something bigger and more expensive anyway."
5,Works good in South Austin,"I can't tell you how far I am from the closest transmitter, but I am very pleased with how well it looks. I receive all the major networks clearly, and a few others that I will probably never watch. I have it sitting on top of the entertainment center agaisnt an outer wall. Pleasantly surprised."
3,probably better for outdoor use,"The antenna is billed as an indoor/outdoor antenna and I got it for indoor use. However, I think it will probably work better as an outdoor antenna. I have compared its indoor performance with a flat RCA antenna. The two are about equally good in pulling in stations, but the RCA has the advantage of being more compact and omnidirectional, whereas this one is sensitive to which way it is pointed. The setup instructions leave a lot to be desired because they consist primarily of pictures, not words, and some of the pictures were not entirely clear as to their orientation."
5,stronger signal as advertised,"i bought this to replace some cheapish terk looking device, so a comparison isn't really fair, but that $30ish-looking antenna would lose signals and required being pointed and elevated. i bought this thing and as i was trying to position it around my tv, i dropped it behind the tv and onto the chest the tv is sitting on. this thing picks up signals quite well for being in a triangular spot that is the tv and a room corner while randomly pointed and elevated 4' off the ground and at least two walls away from the open air in a 1-story house with no highrises around. i get significantly few signal drops, though i didn't bother to count if i received more or less hd channels.it ain't pretty, smaller than it looks in the picture, but it sure works and i don't see it anymore. i'd repurchase in a heartbeat."
3,Only so so,"I could not get the picture quality to be all that good. No matter what I did some of the channels I really wanted would not come through or their picture quality was very bad. Reading the review on some others I thought I might have the same issue with others. I decided to increase the reception area of the antenna to see if the quality would improve. Since it is in the attic and does not get to be seen much at all, its appearance was not that big a deal. I ended up attaching multiple long & looping wires to the antenna to increase the reception surface area. It worked. Except for one channel that I don't care much about I am able to get all other channels, some with excellent quality and these were the channels I could not receive before. You might have better luck with something else or it might work better for you than it did for me. Good luck."
5,Impressive...,"Purchased this to receive over-the-air HD channels in West Los Angeles (specifically, the southern end of Brentwood). AntennaWeb predicted that I would not receive ANY HD channels using an outdoor antenna from my location. I am happy to report that upon installing the DB2 I now receive ALL HD channels in the area. Needless to say, I am impressed.The antenna itself is surprisingly light, but does not feel flimsy. Be advised that it does not come with a pole to mount it on. Rooftop installation was not an option for me in my multi-unit apartment building, so I have described my set-up below for those interested.My set-up is: DB2 mounted on top of a broomstick stuck in concrete in a large bucket on my balcony. It is very sturdy and allows for adjusting the direction of the antenna easily (which has not been necessary as I get a great signal on all channels). My make-shift antenna stand ran me about 8 bucks at Home Depot for the concrete and the bucket.Highly recommended."
5,great antenna that works indoor,"I bought this antenna after reading many of the positive reviews, including those from people using it indoor. Previously I used a rabbit ear antenna and was able to receive all the basic channels here in NW Austin: FOX, PBS, NBC, ABC, CBS, and CW (9 including sub-channels). Signal strength was good most of the time, occasional pixelated images, but the antenna had to be fully extended and was very unsightly. To solve this problem I installed this antenna in the master bedroom closet right above the cable distribution box (mounted it flat against the wall). The reception has improved; I can still receive all the same network channels plus a couple of new Spanish channels. This is pretty good considering the less than optimal install: indoor, first floor, not facing stations. I can't say anything bad about this product other than the photos in the instructions don't appear to match the actual product. Fortunately it's a piece of cake to install."
5,Reception in my basement when no other antenna worked,"This antenna has worked in my basement when no other antenna would. I live equally 30 miles between two major TV markets and I can pick-up stations from both cities in my basement. Ultimately, I moved this antenna outdoors and I receive 90-95% reception strength for the signals that I have pointed my antenna at and 70-80% reception stength from the signals that my attenna is not facing.This is intended to be an ourdoor antenna but the size is small enough to hide behind a TV or entertainment console with little trouble.I highly recommend this antenna!"
3,"thought it was indoor, might work great outdoors.","Antennas Direct DB2 Multi Directional HDTV AntennaI'm sure it's good, but need indoor antenna, it's only for outdoors."
2,Stick with rabbit ears,"No better than rabbit ears, but much more costly. Very hard to hide if you use it for inside use. Not sure what I expected, but very disappointed with HD reception. Should have bought a used pair of rabbit ears at a rummage sale!"
1,Good ONLY for UHF,Absolutly worthless for picking up any stations that are broadcasting in the VHF spectrum. You would be better served buying one that guarantees it will pick up both UHF AND VHF.
3,Antenna signal gathering ability,I ordered and received the DB2 and for the Daytona Beach area it was not worth the trouble to assemble and use. Just not good enough for this area.
5,Perfect for our area,"This antenna brings in many more channels than the rabbit ears we were previously using. This is quite an improvement. Before we attached the antenna, we were lucky to get the local PBS, and maybe 2 other fuzzy local channels. Now we get about 8 channels and the picture is crisp and clear."
4,better than expected,"I expected to have to put this outside, but I set it on the stand by my TV & it works wonderfully! It's small enough that I can put a plant in front of it to hide it if I want to or I can just leave it be...I highly recommend this product!"
5,Works perfectly!,"We originally bought the much more expensive Terk HD-TVS Slim-Profile Outdoor HDTV Antenna for $90 and had horrible luck. We sent it back and got this one. It works like a dream! We are about 10 miles outside of town with rolling hills and lots of tall trees, and we immediately got reception just having it sit on the floor inside the house. We also got an amp and that made the signal even stronger. We are now getting all the local stations nicely. It is also very light and small so installation is easy, though it does not come with a J-bar or any other mounting device. For the price and quality I highly recommend it!"
3,Used indoors,"It is suggested for outdoor/indoor/attic use. I bought it for indoors. It doesn't stand up on its own, so I had to prop it up by leaning it between two speakers on top of my entertainment center. It brings in a great signal and, in addition to the regular channels I got by rabbit ears, it allows me to get a couple of local low powered UHF channels and our new out of town FOX channel that is still scrambling to cover our market area. I like it except for the fact that you have to find some way to prop it up for indoor use."
3,Not quite what I expected!,"Antennas Direct DB2 Multi Directional HDTV AntennaThe antenna was not up to my expectations (derived from reading various reviews about the product). I was planning to use it inside the house to pull in all the stations that I wanted. The DB2 works but not as well as the antenna I was planning to replace with it. I was and still am using a Phillips MANTS510 ""rabbit ear type with built-in amplifier"". If you think you could be at the edge of the reception range, it might be best to go with the DB4 (the doubled antenna)."
3,Outside Antenna,"This is an ok antenna that looks like something you could make at home out of your old antennas and a shopping cart. As long as you find the correct positioning, which can be found online for just about any area, you will have a strong signal. The product info stated this was an Indoor/Outdoor antenna, but be warned: This anteanna is for OUTSIDE use only! You may also need to get the hardware that is sold separately, unless you have a pole laying around (like the one you use for Festivus!)"
5,top notch antenna,the db2 is easy to assemble and draws in all my local digital channels with ease.at$40.00 it was also a good value.
3,Ok Antenna,OK Multi Directional antenna. I live about 13 miles from the transmission towers in North NJ.I can get about a dozen digital channels (HD and SD).I probably should have gone with their larger DB4 Multi Directional antenna.
5,Awesome!!!,"I'm usually pretty critical about products, especially ones that get high reviews, but this is one product that met the hype! This is my second antenna, but i had to learn the hard way. I tried others of that were cheaper, but they couldn't match to this DB2 Antenna."
4,Excellent antenna,"This is an excellent antenna that I use INDOORS. The only issue I had is that I would have liked a recommendation to purchase cable (and what type cable) with the antenna. Since I've never purchased an antenna, I didn't realize it didn't come with cable."
5,Retro future!,"I was pleased to find more than two dozen digital broadcast streams in my area - all stations must switch over to digital in the next year, and most seem to have already added a digital broadcast channel. Some are HD (the major networks), and many more are SD. I tried to tune digital stations with included TV antennas, external stick antenna, hoops, bowties, amplified and not. The best I achieved before the DB2 was one or two good channels, and then many drop-outs and bad sound from the rest. My DB2 is actually just perched in a basement window right now, but I receive *all* my locally broadcast channels perfectly. This antenna is head and shoulder above the competition. Remember TV as a kid - moving the antenna around for each channel, and that's all there was? We hope to go back to that and drop our satellite subscription. With this antenna, we get HD content from ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, and FOX all for free."
4,Improvement over TERK,Bought to replace a Terk model that I haven't been too thrilled with. Picking up more stations and improved signal on the ones I already had.
4,HD antenna,"This antenna was originally designed for outdoors. Because of it's small size, it's being used as an indoor antenna and has been rated as the best indoor HD antenna. According to the website that gives you distances from where you live to the nearest broadcasting towers, I'm 14 miles away from most of them. I hung it in my window (which was the best location after moving it around) and am receiving every HD station (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, WOR, PIX plus their digital extra stations like weather)in my area except for the PBS one. It's multi-directional and doesn't need to be re-aimed for different stations. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it is sensitive to people movement. Many indoor antennas are. However, it can be more annoying with HD. Unlike analog stations where you get static, it's all or nothing with HD reception. You get good reception (no static) or none (or digital breakup). Sometimes you can move and lose the station for a moment."
5,Great reception,"This antenna works great for us, a huge improvement over the amplified rabbit ears we tried to use. It leaves something to be desred appearance wise, but you get better reception if you mount it outside or in the attic like we did. The package was missing missing a washer and nut, but otherwise this is a great product."
4,Great picture,antenna works fine mounted on roof.Great reception and clear picture.Many stations are picked up.Great deal.
1,"Fast shipping, but poor quality",The shipping arrived faster than I expected. The product inside the package was poorly packed ( looked like a returned box ) and even with some pieces missing. I couldn't put it to work at all so I quickly returned it.
1,Not large enouth,It did not do the job for us and we had a professional installer bring his choice and install it. Now we have excellent reception.
5,Beats the silver sensor,"After reading all the positive ads, I bought it to replace the Terk silver sensor type antenna that I had been using.It is a directional antenna, but not as directional as the silver sensor. I was able to set it and forget it and get all my stations. It also is less prone to interference, so there are fewer glitches. Works well for bring in my fm stations as well to a stereo tuner."
4,Excellent for indoor use.,"I agree with the consensus that this is the better alternative to most indoor antennas for indoor use. The reception is outstanding and the signal maintained is strong and withstands interference even expensive indoor antennas can't.This passive unit is superior to my Terk amplified indoor unit.It's a little tricky to assemble. Mine arrived completely in parts and it's not designed to be erected indoors so some creativity is needed. No stand etc. No cable for TV which is typically built in for an indoor unit.Overall though, it's a worthy investment."
2,"NOT Multi-Directional, NOT a Suitable Indoor Antenna","The Antennas Direct DB2 is FAR from multi-directional and is NOT a suitable INDOOR antenna as suggested in the product description. If you have the luxury of sticking it outside, I'm sure it MUST work better since there are so many people with glowing reviews.I live in a 'yellow' coded metropolitan area and thought for sure the DB2 would allow me to grab every last drop of signal available, however, the RCA Multi-Directional Digital Flat Amplified Antenna I bought for $24.99 at Walmart outperformed it HANDS DOWN in channels received and signal strength; not to mention the 8 inch x 8 inch, white RCA looks a MILLION times better than the 2 ft. x 2 ft. scarecrow of the digital world, the DB2.Bottom line: They should stick with their original description as a uni-directional OUTDOOR antenna.I can't believe I'm going to say this, but... I'll keep the RCA."
5,"Finally, my solution",I installed this on the roof of my house and I am finally getting perfect digital TV reception. This has done what the powered indoor antennas that I bought could not do. All of the channels are within about 10 miles of my house and all but one come in with 100% signal strength. And the one that isn't 100% hasn't shown any degredation that I've seen. This was easy to assemble and easy to attach to the j-mount. I ran the coax into my outside cable box for distribution throughout the house. It turned out to be a much simpler project than I expected.
4,Digital TV Antenna,"Update 26 Aug 2010: Overcame the directionality problem by removing the reflector screen. Reception remains superior to rabbit ears. Antenna is mounted indoors.Good improvement over rabbit ears. Does not pick up more channels in our urban, tree lined area. Quite directional which for us is a bit of a problem: our major channels are 180 degrees apart ( see [...] ). Have considered purchasing another, point it 180 degrees away from the first and use A-B switch to toggle between them."
4,Great for Uptown Dallas,I live in an apartment building in Uptown Dallas surrounded by other apartment buildings. I was able to get about 20 channels with the antennae mounted inside my living room window. Not bad.
3,"Ahh, Just OK.","We've been using this for over a month now. It brings in only a few more channels than we had with our indoors rabbit ears. It doesn't work any better than a homemade antenna made with coat hangers. Look on YouTube for DTV antenna. We have several TV's and use the coathanger antenna on one, and it gets the same channels as this which cost $50 with the hanging tube. I was hoping to get many more channels than we have. It's an easy way to get some extra channels, and it looks much better than one made with coathangers."
3,"OK, but the Terk HDTVa worked better for me",I tried the DB2 after reading the great reviews. I already own the Terk HDTVa amplified antenna which works much better for me. The DB2 pulled in every channel (UHF and VHF) that my Terk does with the exception of channel 20. The DB2 wasn't getting stations with as much signal strength and was much more touchy than my Terk. I had to reposition the DB2 to pull in different stations a few times. The Terk only needs to be rotated 90 degrees for a couple stations. I didn't try to put the DB2 on the roof so I don't know if it would have performed better there. I tried numerous positions indoors with the DB2 with no luck. It did pull in the stations but the Terk HDTVa outperformed it overall.
2,Direct DB2 HDTV antenna,I should have returned it. It barely works better than the simple rabbit ears I was using. I am 20 miles from nearest transmitter.
4,works well,I liked it so much I had to buy the bigger badder version. If you're sick of paying to watch TV this is a great substitute.
4,indoor use (NYC),"Not too large. Using indoors in NYC, but window facing east, so not getting channel 7, 11, 13, but stable 25, 50, 2, 4, 5, 9 etc. Could get a splitter to get 13 with rabbit ears, but is much better than the amplified ears alone."
5,35.5-miles and in a closet.,"Am 35.5-miles from Phoenix, AZ hdtv stations that I wanted to receive. Placed the antenna on a high-shelf in my closet attached to 25' RG6 solid copper quad-shield coax cable and aimed antenna to 255-degrees. Works great."
4,It works!,"I replaced my old in-attic vhf antenna with this one. Although small and unimpressive compared with the old one, it was easy to assemble and install. I upgraded the antenna hook-ups and now I receive more channels and a better picture than ever before!"
4,Great quality. Better outside than in.,"This antenna is well built, easy to install, and provides very good picture quality. It is an excellent value for the price. The instructions were a little ambiguous but ultimately, it was easy to set up. The signal is definitely better outside on the roof than inside."
4,Good buy,"Good signal reception for Columbus, OH, I get all basic public channel including HD abc and others"
4,Does the job,"I'm some 20 miles from the transmitting sources, with a relatively clear path.When the transition to digital arrived, my attic antenna worked for some channels, but was very spotty on others, picture popped in and out. I tried a highly rated ""set top"" antenna but my TV is located in an inner room blocked by several walls from the direction of the signal transmission, so the results were not much better.This antenna is mounted on a air flow pipe in the attic, and all but one channel comes in very well. The one channel which occasionally pops in and out is a foreign language channel I don't watch, but is there because the automatic scan picked it up. I have no idea why this particular channel has a problem the direction and distance of the signal seems to be acceptable.The four star is because of the one channel ""problem"", otherwise I highly recommend this item."
3,"Better, but still not pulling all of the local channels","I now get more stations. However,a station I used to get now has very poor quality. I wish I would have seen the double antenna version of this product."
5,Beat HDTV Antenna Ever Bought,"Best antenna I ever bought. Small size, easy to install and picked all HD channels in 30+ miles radius with 90+ strength. Woudl recommend to anyone."
3,Somewhat pleased,"I bought this antenna to replace an indoor antenna following the digital switch. I live in the suburbs between Wash. DC and Baltimore so I am about 20 miles away from most of the broadcast towers. I bought this for my small hdtv in my kitchen which I use to watch local news and sports while I am eating or preparing meals. When the digital switch came, I could only receive one channel with my old indoor antenna. With the DB2, I can receive about 5 stations. Unfortunately, the signal for most stations remains about 60 which is the minimum for reception. Periodically, the picture and sound will ""clip"" out which can be irritating. If this tv was my primary, I would have dumped the DB2 some time ago and gotten a better exterior antenna, cable, or a dish. As it is, I can live with it because I seldom watch it for more than a half hour at a time. An interesting note, I tried mounting this antenna in my attic and on the roof. I wound up getting better reception from my attic. Go figure!"
4,"UHF HDTV only, no VHF HDTV","This is a great little antenna and pulls in a strong UHF signal. But beware, some HDTV remains on the VHF frequencies. Check your stations before buying. After the switch to digital, I lost two major stations because they changed their frequencies from UHF to VHF."
3,A great book read,"This book gets you to imagine how amazing can be junior high, all the crazy stuff you've had pass throught it. Read you'll love it."
1,Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Flimsy piece...,After spending hours putting this together with another person (a third would have been useful as well) it is not stable. The directions that come with it are a joke. Spend a few more bucks and get something that is worth while. If i could i would give it zero stars.
4,USED TO STORE BOOKS,"THEY DO VERY WELL ITS JOB. SOME SHELVES WERE BENT AND BAD PAINTED. HARD TO ASSEMBLY. NICE PRICE, THANK YOU."
2,didnt have enough supplies,"I was so excitted get my self I have just started couponing and stock piling items. I felt that for the price why not try out this. I got it and my hubby and I started putting it together and we discovered we were missing screws. we made due, but i keep saying I am going to call so we can finish this item completly. we are only missing 5 screws, but they are needed fr the support spots."
3,Make sure you have an electric screwdriver!!!,"The reviews concerning the construction of this item are all true. It is not a complicated process, just many screws and bolts to tighten, combined with less many slots that are not easy to reach. I put it together in about an hour using an electric screwdriver... without that tool, however, I would've probably given up because screwing each of those bolts in by hand would be to tedious to contemplate. It is pretty flimsy and I wouldn't trust it for anything very heavy, but I'm using it to stack some files, and it works fine. It can be unstable if you load too much at the top.In conclusion, if you need a cheap set of shelves for fairly light goods, these will work fairly well...but do yourself a favor and MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN ELECTRIC SCREWDRIVER!!!"
4,goid shelves,These shelves are same I had 20 years ago. Assembly was lots bolts but ok to do. Thus us a good product. I like the number of shelves.
2,Holes do not match up,"You start by putting the bolts through the long sides of the shelves, front or back. The bolts can not go most double holes in the short sides since the two holes do not match up. Sometimes, they are so mis-matched there is no metal for the second bolt hole. There is nothing to drill through for the second hole. You can drill a second hole for some of the shelves. Even when the two holes match up, you need to go to a hardware store to get longer bolts to get completely through the two holes to put a nut on. Good luck."
3,Does the job,This was a very cheaply made shelving unit. Very. The shelves were bent out of shape when we got it so we had to even them out... It took much longer to put it together because the holes wouldn't line up on the shelves and legs. And there's NO WAY it could hold 1750 pounds.
2,Time for assembly REALLY not worth the money you save,"I want to start off by saying that these shelves could be awesome. They are cheaply but mostly intelligently made. But the packaging was so bad, I spent quite literally and hour and a half fixing each one. I assembled three and it took the better part of two days. The screws it's made out of strip before getting tight enough, and bends in shipping prevent it from going together at all.After shipping, I ended up only paying ~$8 more for Gorilla shelves elsewhere."
3,Decent shelving but Amazon charges shipping!,"Just a heads up to Prime and other amazon members... they're going to want thirty bucks to ship this to you. More than the shelving unit is currently selling for on Amazon!The unit itself isn't bad, kinda. Works well, purchased from another location, and it was worth the price.. but not a whole lot more. I definitely wouldn't store 750 lb on it."
1,Very disappointed with this device,"I hate this device for many reasons. You need to be a computer genius to make this work at all. It takes more time to figure it out than it is worth. I have been trying to use it along with the dragon program for months now and I give up. The recorder has one tiny, tiny button in the middle that does everything or if you aren't good with it it does nothing you ask it to do. I can not even find out how to turn it off so I have to take the batteries out each time and then re-insert them. I would throw it out the window but am afraid I might hit someone and get sued. The direction sheet is unreaable and measures 3 ft. by 3 ft. as you unfold it and try to use it. I am going to use my daughters cheap one and maybe actually get something accomplished. So upset. I spent over 250.00 and wasted untold hours of my research time."
2,Naturally Speaking Supported uo to Win 7,The now have drivers for up to Windows 7. I have it running fine. Great product!I would rate it a 4 now.
4,Easy to use digital recorder with high quality sound,"I have used several digital recorders over the last few years. This is by far one of the best in its price range. Sound is excellent, however the software that comes with it may or may not be compatablie with Vista or Windows 7. The door that opens to remove the card, get loose after a lot of use, and there is a tendecy to drain batteries quickly, but for high quality sound recording in a small package, well worth the money."
3,Got what was advertised eventually,"When I received my order the software enclosed was the recorder edition NOT the preferred edition promised in the spec sheet. Since you can get the recorder for about 200.00 elsewhere the selling point for me was the preferred software. After multiple calls all over the world and getting a whole new shipment of exactly the same wrong thing, Amazon finally saw the light and through a very convulted process was able to satisfy the order. Basically they refunded me the price of the Dragon 9 preferred software form my ICD order and then I bought the software from another one of their listings. So in the end - thanks Amazon (although I do think things could be a lot less complicated)"
5,The Founding Fathers as Evangelical Christians?,"Excellent Book. Amazing how these two men, once bitter rivals, could wriye so many letters to each other. (This book records some of them) You can almost feel the admiration and respect emerge between them. My only feeling of regret is that they never met during this time.A blow to those who teach that the Founders were Evangelical Christians. These men did not believe in the Diety of Jesus and explain to each other why they came to this conclussion. Great Reading"
5,Totally worth the money...,"I purchased this set this june and I have to admit that I was a bit scared what I will find there because I thought it was suspiciously cheap considering what everything is supposed to be here and how much you have to pay for the single season. Well, I was more than happy when it came. I can surely recommend this for everyone who likes Criss Angel. And even though I don't like spending so much money, I can gladly say it was more than worth it. There are all five seasons, a lot of bonus material and also Halloween special. Simply perfect!"
5,Criss Angel Mindfreak- Great Show,I really enjoyed the dvd series by Criss Angel. It is a great value for the box set. Great for casual observer or for the magician in training.
1,This is just noise.,I purhased this CD because I like The Beatles. Big mistake! You can recognize the songs if you pay attention but paying attention to this CD is painful. It is just noise.
3,"Some good, some not so good.",I love French music and thought this compilation would be a nice addition to my collection. It's so-so. There are some really great songs and some mediocre.
4,Design and Development of the Indy Car,This book shows the evolution of the Indy Car from the early days until the early 1980s. This is a good reference book but will be very hard to find since it is out-of-print. These race cars were state-of-the-art in 1982.
4,Pretty good.,"The best thing about this book was Chad Givens. If you're a girl (and you probably are since you're reading a series called ""Love Stories""), you'll know what it's like having a really big crush on a guy who ""doesn't think of you that way."" Chad is sweet because he cares a lot about Shauna, but he believes she could never love a brain like him. Can she? After all, gorgeous Shauna is dating superstar jock Tommy whom she has admired a far for a long time. Will Shauna be willing to give up the popularity of dating the most popular boy in school for her tutor? Stay tuned. (If you liked this story, you HAVE to try another book in this series: Some Girls Do- by Dahlia Kosinski!!! It's my favorite)"
2,annoying,"i didnt really like this book all that much. i mean dont get me wrong its sweet and all but seriously, we want to relate to the characters. shauna is a hot, popular cheerleader whom a lot of guys adore, plus she has a hot boyfriend. now i dont kno about yall but not many ppl have this fairytale life. why should the popular one get to fall in love also. i liked chad but seriously can we get a real girl instead of the kind of girl we all love to hate."
2,Two of the most boring episodes,This tape contains two of the first SOUTH PARK episodes I ever saw and I loved it but being the fan of the show that I am now these episodes are beyond ordinary and fairly unfunny. You may want to take a glimpse of it once but if you get into the series then I'm sure you'll agree with me.PS The second episode on the tape VOLCANO is OK but I can't say much at all about CARTMAN GETS AN ANEL PRO.
1,Good luck!,"If you hold a Ph.D. in anthropology or are looking for disertation material for your thesis, or just want to hold your own at academic cocktail parties, take a try at this book. However, it's NOT for the general reader---or even the above-general reader. I have tried several times to slug through the dry text which was obviously written to impress academia and the author himself. Even with a reasonbly high I.Q. and an advanced degree, I had trouble staying interested and understanding the material. There is little doubt this author is an expert in this subject; however, he missed a good opportunity to get the rest of us interested and to impart in a readable and understandable way the obviously vast knowledge which he holds. I'm very impressed at how well the author ""showed off,"" but I would much rather have learned something more about this fascinating subject...which was the purpose of buying the book."
3,An ok book,"This book has strong and weak chapters and average usability. It consist of a mixture of good advice: ""Nervous money tends to become some elses money"", long and tideous explanations on online technology, lame explanations about charts: ""The vertical (Y) axis shows the price level, and the horisontal (X) axis shows time""...if you did not know this or could not figure it out yourself, you should nok trade at all.Stronger chapters looked at risk control & money management and some interesting interviws with for example Linda Bradford Raschke. Also a chapter by Hank Pruden (follower of the Wyckoff method) was great. Dave Landry (The Bow Tie System) also contributes, but many of the methods can be found on the Internet. Just type ""Bow Tie Patteren"" and you will be greatly rewarded for free :)The money management section helped me a lot and if you have not figured out that theme yet I would buy this book only to read those 42 pages."
5,Really a great book!,"This book was recommended to a fellow Reiki practitioner in Japan. I looked for a copy for some time and was glad when I could get it from Amazon. (I even contacted the publisher but got no reply.)Anyway, this book makes Reiki practice simple. It is very comprehensive but is a wonderful book to have and refer to often.The English is abit messy but easliy understood.I also recommend Steve Murray's Ultimate Reiki book. Another wonderful book. I think these two books are important works in the field of Reiki today."
4,Open heart,"In the West, there are many Masters and many confusion about Reiki. Sometimes they do not know enough to teach. The Master Hiroshi Doi opened his heart and let the knowledgement flow when he wrote this book. Not many Japonese Masters, and Asians in general, are willing to do so. The book is very good for those who do not have the opportunity to travel to Asia to meet the old Masters and are lost with so many confusion among the Westerners Masters. Sometimes,the sellers overcharge it."
4,Exam prep,"This was a great resource for the class, we were fortunate enough to have great teachers and a great curriculum and didn't need the prep book as much as thought."
1,Zero stars if possible!!,"I agree with everyone who says this is total trash, because it is. Terrible lyrics, annoying beat, dumb video. But if you like that crap pop with the playboy video, then buy it! You (won't) be disappointed"
4,Geek Rock,"There haven't really been many acts these past few years that really have been more about image than the feeling or uniqueness of great pop music. One of the most surprising acts these past few years is definitely Weezer. They have really brought up a great deal with the feel of geek rock, and their latest single really does connect with everybody. Their latest track Beverly Hills is a great pop song. It is very upbeat and easily catchy. I like this song because it is very different and very vivid. Rivers Cuomo and company have really got a lot into good music right now. Hopefully, they can keep it up with their next single.Song: B 1/2+"
5,the best song by weezer,"i don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. obviously they don't like weezer, so i don't know why they're even reviewing this cd.but anyway, this song is a little different from weezer's usual stuff. but i really really recommend you at least watch the music video if you aren't planning on buying this cd."
1,"This isn't Weezer, this just plain blows.","Ok, weezer used to be what would one day become a perfect example of a mid 90's rock band that could have started a revoltuion if they had stuck to their roots, but on the other hand they have gone the way of crappy bands with no talent such as good charlotte, this song is so god awful, it sounds as bad as something the corperate execs would tell good charlotte to write, but even worse, theres no substance and the stupid video almost makes me cringe even more, sure hot girls are cool and all, but wouldnt decent music be a nice thing to be added in there? I still love pinkerton and blue, but this sucks, sucks... don't give in to this crap along with all the other 13 year old trl watchers..."
2,weak,"dont get me wrong. i like weezer. i've liked them for a long time since their debut cd. i just found this to be a bit annoying. they're just giving into this image that all these other losers are grouped into and its sad to see that happen. the single is weak. the lyrics are pathetic. anyone could write lyrics as boring as that. sounds like he made it up while he was playing it. it's like ""The Joker"" meets ""We Will Rock You"". like a lame attempt at making an anthem for rich people. we dont need that from weezer. let the other mainstream pop idiots do that. hopefully this is just a fad and it will blow over. the live tracks are ok i guess and the video, but forget the single. yeah, its catchy, but its just not weezer material. 3 chords? thats all they're giving to us? come on. they could do better than that. i could write that. my dog could. but im not giving up on them yet..."
2,A Hard Case,"I think I've dropped my phone more since I purchased the case--in fact, I hadn't dropped it until I purchased it. The reason being: The clip detaches itself from the case causing my phone (w/ case) to drop or the clip dislodges itself from the item (bag, pants, etc.) it's clipped onto. After the first fall, I had trouble getting the ""door"" to close, but bent it back into place. (The ""door"" always flies open when it falls, by the way.) Now the case itself looks a little askew, but I am able to keep it closed (unless it drops again)."
4,Pretty good stuff,"Pretty good metal. Its not the best or most creative stuff out there, but it definitely gets the job done for me. Good to see another good heavy metal band come out of Iowa."
2,"if you already know spanish, don't bother","I was fluent in Spanish many years ago, but have lost it with disuse. I was looking for a book that would give me relevant vocabulary in an easy to read format. This book spends several chapters talking about different verbs and how to conjugate them, as well as how to pronounce things. there is minimal vocabulary, and minimal basic pet care conversational information."
4,Good basic book.,"If you want to be fluent in Spanish, this isn't for you. If you interact with Spanish speaking clients and are looking to learn how to take a basic history and explain treatment options this is a good starting spot. We are using it as part of a class and it has worked wonderfully. Having a Spanish language background is helpful, even just a year or two in high school to understand the basics."
3,most designs are for intarsia knitting,"You'll like this book if you're crazy about intarsia knitting. Only a small selection of squares uses pattern instead of colour. Many squares have beads and sequins - I imagine it makes for an interesting-looking but uncomfortable blanket! The individual squares themselves are uninspired - geometric (lots of squares and circles), stripes, simple motifs like hearts and stars. Still, for the price, it's not a bad book. By ""for the price"" I mean that as of February 2004, you shouldn't have to pay more than US$ 7 for this book - it's been remaindered. I picked up my copy yesterday at a Canadian book superstore for CAD$ 7.50, and there were skids of them."
3,"Wild patterns, good techniques","At first glance, I was very disappointed with this book. The ""afghan squares"" are mostly pictures such as flowers, shapes, and blocks. All were a bit too 80's for my taste (bright, tacky patterns). The technique section in the back kept this book from being an utter failure in my opinion. This section explains knitting with beads and sequins, working with different colors, and gives tips on blocking and piecing blocks together."
4,Easy to mix- and - match,"The best thing about this book is that although the squares are put together into specific afghans, there are clear instructions on how to mix and match them to make your own customized afghan. The patterns are all relatively simple and well-explained, and the color combinations are really striking. The only drawback is that all the suggested yarns are made by rowan. The back flap of the book says that the author is a Rowan employee, so it's understandable that she would suggest these yarns, but Rowan yarn is out of the price range of many knitters, especially for the size of an afghan that could cost hundreds of dollars with a yarn like that. But as a starting point for some great combinations, I think it's a great book to have on your shelf for reference! I learned a lot just adapting some of the squares."
4,"Easy, fun patterns!","I got this book from the library initially (have sense ordered my own copy) to make a quick afghan as a graduation present. The patterns are fun to choose from. I didn't try to mix and match yet, so didn't have an issue with square sizes when combining them. However, I did have an issue that options weren't given for smaller size afghans - lap size. You have to make your own call on how many squares to do (and which ones) to make a smaller size blanket. Additionally, I used needles larger than recommended for slightly larger squares that have worked out nicely. I made the ""Flower Power"" afghan in 6 bright colors - mixed and matched for the stripes and flowers and did one solid of each color. The larger needles made the squares approximately 10 inches each. I am very happy with my results and am looking forward to starting another one. I will, however (thanks to another review) be careful to watch that my squares are the same size if I mix patterns."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"My classmates and I voted on this book because it seemed very interesting. As I began reading chapter after chapter, everything started to get confusing. There would be times in this book where the story would just stop and jump into another story, such as unnecessary letters. The book did not stay right on point with its story about Hanssen being a spy. As the story got into the Opus Dei's ""religion"" or their beliefs, I asked my self WHAT does this have to do with beig a SPY? I do not recommend this book to anybody. It's not a steady pace book."
3,"good story, bad writing","This book probably does a better job of telling Hanssen's story than David Vise's ""The Bureau and The Mole,"" but I was too often distracted by the infelicitous prose. Is a ""psychiatric professional"" anything like a psychiatrist? English teachers beware, espionage enthusiasts exult!"
2,The Reader Who Stayed Out In The Cold,"The book is great tool for beginner writers that are looking for a good example of a RUSHED job. This book best describes itself as the Adrian Havill's collection of interviews and newspaper articles of Robert Hanssen's case. It is a tedious and tiring piece. The author often diverts the readers from its main idea with endless letters and unnecessary details. The way he describes the Foxtone Park with all the animals and bushes and little roads, drove my attention way. The editing of this book threw me off. I had to stop and read over and over again until be able to group the main idea with the information provided. The author's psychological opinion about Hanssen's behavior, the interviews with Bob's relatives, the encoded letters from the Russians it's all blended together in a mediocre editing."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother reading this book. It is the same thing over and over and over, so that it makes one want to scream. The movie ""Breach"" is not the true story either. It's Hollywood. Read David Wise's book, the best of the bunch written about spy Robert Hanssen. Hanssen was a brilliant if not troubled non agent who wanted to be the real deal. So instead of getting to be an FBI operative, he went to the dark side and made himself a name giving up our country's secrets that may never be recovered. It is enough to scare you to death and make you ill."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"HORRIBLE!!!...MassMy classmates and I voted on this book because it seemed very interesting. As I began reading chapter after chapter, everything started to get confusing. There would be times in this book where the story would just stop and jump into another story, such as unnecessary letters. The book did not stay right on point with its story about Hanssen being a spy. As the story got into the Opus Dei's ""religion"" or their beliefs, I asked my self WHAT does this have to do with beig a SPY? I do not recommend this book to anybody. It's not a steady pace book."
2,Spy Games,"This book was interesting and an easy ready but contained a great deal of information already printed/broadcasted in CNN, ABCnews or Washington Post. A few interviews with Hanssen's friends and old college buddies seemed to be the only new information in the book. Basically, if you know anything about this case, you don't need to read the book. Much of the new information is Opus Dei chatter and discussions of rabbit mating patterns in the parks of Vienna Virginia."
1,Leaves Much To Be Desired,I was sorely disappointed in this book. The writing style was choppy and Havill's presentation of his findings lacked a comprehensive exploration. Havill's research seems to mirror the same information available from the first news coverage which still leaves many questions in the mind of the reader. At best this book serves as an expensive beverage coaster.
1,Disappointing,"It was a struggle to get through this book. The author clearly threw this together to get the book out there quickly. His references to various characters keep changing and it is often unclear what person is being discussed. The book contains large sections of Hanssen's overwraught, boring letters to the Russians, cut and pasted in the book in long format by the author. The author diverts us from the main story with a strangely inapplicable discussion of Catholic ""cults"". Note: recent events detailing Hanssen's sexual proclivities (not the stripper stories discussed in the book, but taping of he and his wife, voyeurism, etc.) cause the author to have egg on his face. The author's adamant opinion is that Hanssen was straight as an arrow despite his relationship with a stripper."
4,Excellent overview of Directory Services,"This book provides more than a theoretical overview. The authors dig deeper and explain design ideas to implementation issues. The book is written for technical professionals and not ""managers"". (no offense)"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is undoubtedly the worst art instructional video I have ever seen. There is no dialogue to explain what is going on, the hand-held camera work is extremely jittery, there is nothing except quick views of a fast-moving brush slapping paint on a canvas. I didn't expect or want elementary instruction, as I have been painting several years, but there was no instruction at any level. What a disappointment."
3,From Back Cover,"For weeks, Derek Buchanan has been trying to tell gorgeous leggy pal Sydney Travers that he loves her. And he's planning on seducing her...But even Derek's surprised when one night the soft-hearted veterinarian turns to him for comfort - and they have the most incredible sex!The Secret...Sydney is shocked - Derek is her best friend, the buddy who's held her hand through a string of disastrous blind dates. Making love was a huge mistake. Now Derek knows all her fantasies and secrets...except the one about wanting a baby on her own. No strings, no commitment."
4,4-1/2 stars - a winner!,"Well-placed humor, lots of sensuality, an endearing hero and spunky heroine, good characterization. A book with a different spin. Delightful and sexy. I plan to hunt down the author's backlist now."
5,Exceeds my expectations,"Being an I.T. staff employee that provides desktop support to about 150 users, I needed a book that provided plenty of knowledge regarding the configuration and streamlined use of Outlook 2003 Client under Windows Server 2003. I'm only on chapter 10 of 42, and I've already learned several things that I could have put to use in the recent past, but didn't have the know-how. I'm sure that there are books out there that dive deeper into how Outlook 2003 works, but this book is perfect for the more tech-savvy user, and the I.T. support staff that hasn't quite yet made it to administrator status. Sure, some of the reading can get dry (show me an I.T. book that doesn't), but for the most part, this book has held my attention and provided much needed tips and knowledge to better support my users on a daily basis."
3,micro office outlook,"Too much said about the various steps. Not brief and to the point. Found it difficult to go step by step without reading, and reading, and reading."
4,Receiving love,"It was very helpful, to both me & my spouse. We are currently working through some of their other books, because we liked this so well."
3,the best concepts are simple...,"Some of Hendrix's consepts for relationships (and singles, too) are good: his ""Imago dialog"" which is just his patented phrase for ""communication."" Talk to your partener about your feelings, listen to your parter... basic stuff.The rest seems overly complicated and contrived around his theories. It's all based on a set of assumptions rather than facts, and he twists his clinical observations to fit his schema.I wish I had not wasted my time with it. If you need good relationship advice, read something by John Gottman."
5,Nice book for people in love with god.,"As per Bhagwad gita, Bhakti Yoga is one path to reach god and become free. People who cannot follow other paths and believe in prayers and love to worship god unselfishly and help others. This is good book for them.""Every soul is potentially Divine. The goal is to manifest this Divinity with in by controlling nature, external and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control or philosophy- by one or more all of these- and be free."" - SwamiVivekananda"
4,Very useful for understanding the process of leaving the church,"One rarely hears stories about others' agonizing over leaving their religious faith; in most cases, folks just stop attending. The Morins do a thorough job of presenting the cult-like atmosphere of LDS culture, which makes the decision so difficult for so many troubled members. The book left me wondering how many members would quit if the church issued a sort of ""amnesty"" along the lines of: ""Those who want to leave, go ahead!"""
4,Mormon cult,"Having been a member of the LDS Mormon religion for 53 years, 2nd generation Mormon, I left that cult of emotional bondage AFTER they tore my ""forever"" family apart. THEN I researched their history and am thoroughly disgusted with Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. They were power-hungry womanizing men who also murdered. That's religion? The church leaders now, lie and cover up their evil past and change their ""EVERLASTING"" covenants continually. Brigham Young desecrated a cross at a Christian burial site calling it ""a vile, Christian symbol"". He had young men castrated to take their intended brides for a reward for his elderly ""apostles"". PLEASE Mormons, take your blinders off like I finally did."
5,Read it - if only to understand....,"In the six years that I've lived in Salt Lake City, I've been struggling to figure out what motivates Mormons to act the way they do - their bizarre behavior - especially toward people who are not of their faith. This well written, fast reading book gave me insight that I haven't been able to glean from a number of similar books (mostly because they were written with what I felt was a bit to much bitterness and exaggeration). ""Suddenly Strangers"" has a great mix of personal history and well researched Mormon history that I think anyone wishing to just understand the Mormon behavior and thought process will find valuable."
2,OK,"Its an OK album. The band isn't very unique. It seems they have taken sounds from the biggest bands in the last decade or so and constructed songs based on what is/was popular. I hear korn, alice in chains and even megadeth in their music. If you like recycled music with a slice of CHEESE, I recommend this album."
4,finally talent see's light,"not since ""motley crue"" released ""dr.feelgood"" in 1991 have we seen a heavy metal album with so much light.What i mean by light is,the album has it's strike to kill moments and also it's dare to be sensative moments,this album is definately going to make it's mark in the music hall of fame."
5,"The source ands inspiration of ""powers of ten"" and ""comic voyage""","Kees Boeke goes through the universe in logarithmic distance steps, relating the everyday and the observable to the no longer observable, about also no less real world.The illustrations are remarkable accurate for the resources available to Boeke at that time.The images dominate the book. Short and crisp texts support the images.The book is attractive to all levels of education, from making things visible without much comments to young children,to understanding the didactics for advanced physicists.This book was the example and inspiration for the short film ""powers of ten"" of Charles and Ray Eames (see e.g.[...]), which in turn sparked many, many similar materials."
3,Great Ball - but not at this price!,"The NXT golf balls are great for those that shoot in the 80's. You don't get the same feel or control that a ProV1 offers, but if you shoot in the 80's you likely don't have the ability to warant it. I give the ball 5 stars, but the Amazon price one star. So the average is 3. NXT balls can be found at local sporting good stores as well as online for $27 or less."
2,More for Piano than For Guitar and Vocal,"While this is a great collection of songs, including a lot I have never heard of, I was disappointed that ""Complete"" doesn't describe the lyrics. Many of the songs only have 1 or 2 verses and the chorus. For the number of pages, I would have preferred fewer songs and complete lyrics.Also, there are way more chord changes than any guitar player I know would use or than I have ever heard in a song. It makes it difficult to play unless you go through and figure the standard changes.Not being a piano player or great at reading music, I can't say for sure, but it looks about right for simply figuring out a new song on the keyboard."
5,INTERESTING!!!!!!!! AND WELL DONE!! MAKES YOU THINK!!!,"This is A most interesting album! I listened to samples of this CD at a local christian book store.It's hard to describe.It sounds like the star wars soundtrack with a little guitar and A vocalist.Music that John Williams could apreciate.The singers sound like A duet of David bowie and Type O negatives lead singer I believe his name is Peter Steele,But dont quote me on that!any ways I dont Know who they're names are who are in the band,But it rocks and it makes you think about where your relationship is with God! I'm not sure if I'll buy this CD or not?.It is very well done nevertheless."
4,Here the Journey Begins,"For awhile this was my favorite band only to be topped off by another gothic band. Well let me start off with the negative. The beginning of this cd is slow. The singing begins on track 5. Also before or after a few of the songs there is background talking that isn't made to understand or just hard to make out. It is like they just used this to fill time to create a feel that we are getting a full cd. My favorite tracks are Invasion of Israel, The Beast, and The Antichrist. These tracks fit more of a doom style. These songs create a dark atmosphere of being at war. This should have been played in Lord of the Rings during the battle scenes. It is a great cd but this didn't earn 5 stars."
1,Waste of money,"This is nothing more than a toy. Image quality is very poor, build seems cheap. Bought it when they were selling for $900 a couple months ago, can't believe they are $1400 now. Don't waste your money, the gen-3's will be this price soon."
3,good info,for a small book it gets right to the point and nice info and the one thing really special about this book it talks about some of the rare Puffers its a smart book.
4,GET RESTLESS WITH SHELBY,"With her smoky voice and unconventional style, Shelby Lynne has carved a creative niche in country music.RESTLESS boasts a collection of upbeat bluesy tunes with a couple of ballads. The emotional torch song WISH I KNEW is the real standout showcasing Lynne's powerful vocal. Toe-tappers like the title tune, SLOW ME DOWN, JUST FOR THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND and SWINGTOWN are irresistibly entertaining. Accompanying musicians are on target and RESTLESS is a pleasant oasis in the country desert."
4,nice case!,fits great & it protects the screen. and it makes it feel a little bit bigger in your hand.
5,i cried the first time i heard this CD.,"This CD is nothing short of genius. The coma lilies provide nine songs, each one reaching new heights. It is probably the best first CD since ""the mars volta"" or ""DJ shadow, entroducing."" The coma lilies' music is unlike that of anyother band at this time. It is lyrical intrumental music, beautifully structured with perfect melodies and arrangments. Don't get me wrong. -It's really pretty but it will also ROCK your ass. If you like good music (radiohead? aphextwin? DJ shadow? mr. bungle? tool? tom waits? bjork?) than you'll LOVE the coma lilies. It's music for everyone!"
5,A+,"The Coma Lilies has it all. It's been a long time since I heard music this intricate, and beautiful. This album is flawless."
3,You can turn off the complete display,"""You can turn off the complete display so battery will not drain when not in use""?NO!!!The user guide states that you CAN NOT power off!Of cause, you CAN do that by remove the batteries."
1,sony idDB500,"I purchased the IDB500 recorder. Very unfriendly usage, user manual not easy to understand and quality very poor"
3,A little gimmicky,"The recorder has good sound and it is easy to start recording. Setting up a folder and inserting recordings into that folder is not intuitively obvious. In fact, all the features are not intuitive. You have to read the manual which is not well organized.However, once you get the hang of it it's a good recorder."
2,Not good for recording singing,"I bought this product to record my voice lessons and practice. The sound quality of recordings would suffice for speech alone, but is not sufficient for singing. No matter how far away I am from the device, certain pitches cause the sound to become horribly buzzy and full of static. Plus, it's made out of the cheapest plastic in existence."
1,No upload?!,How can a digital product these days have no facility for syncing up with a computer?What if you want to email sound files for transcription?What if you want to back up?This is useless!
3,"playback good, interface not so good","This recorder is compact, easily portable, and records sound well. Some digital recorders I've used result in tinny voices without much depth, but the Sony is fairly true to natural sound. The price is also reasonable for the quality.What I don't care for about it are the following:- battery life seems to be short (average two months with intermittent use)- buttons are almost flush with the casing, so you have to look at what you're doing with each recording. I would have preferred the ""record"" and ""pause/stop"" buttons to be elevated slightly so I could activate by touch.- erasing is not that intuitive. Although you're supposed to be able to hold the erase button down firmly and erase the recording, usually I have to start playing and then press the erase button twice.- organizing in folders seems overly complicated. I have to read the instruction book each time."
2,Not worth the money,This should be one of those Infomercials where they sell it for 14.95 because it is not worth what they are charging for it. If it was offered at 14.95 then maybe it would be. The sound is absolutely horrible. No quality at all even with the mic vol way down. You might use it to record grocery lists or something but it is not much better for anything else. The user manual is not very good either. It was given to me for a Christmas present so I guess I don't need to be complaining too much. I wouldn't buy it though.
3,Sony recorder,I got my sony recordable quickly. I was disappointed in the product. It doesn't come with plug in to download what you have recorded to the computer. Really wasn't what I was hoping for. It is very sensitive to noise. You need a very quiet place when recording because it picks up every little sound. I wanted it to have for record lectures in school but it is difficult to hear the lecture through the other noises in the classroom. I should have actually purchased what I was looking for in a recorder from a store in town. Decent price and not worth the cost to send it back.
4,A worthy successor to the 991,I've had 991's for years and was disappointed when I could no longer buy them. I eventually bit the bullet and bought the 992's and I must say I'm satisfied. I agree with someone else's comment that they run a tad bigger than the 991's. In the 991's my foot is just a tad too big for 10 1/2 so I've been wearing 11. In the 992's the 10 1/2 4E's are very comfortable.
4,New Balance M992 Running Shoe,Good running shoe - light weight and good arch support while keeping a solid hold on the the whole foot.
5,From 991 to 992,"I finally replaced my worn 991s with the newer 992s. I was reluctant because my 991s were very comfortable. I originally purchased them for running, but I wear them everywhere.So far the 992s a just as comfortable. I had to buy a 1/2 size larger this time so sizing may be off compared to the former model. However, the new shoe doesn't fit as well on my heel. I haven't run in them yet, but I'll update if it is a problem. I may just need to break them in.Beware: this is a stability shoe therefore it is somewhat heavier than other running shoes designed with less support. The materials also trap more heat around the foot. If you don't need the additional stability and support of the 992, consider a lighter-weigh running shoe from New Balance made with a more breathable mesh material such as the new MR1223."
5,Instant Comfort!,"I bought these for my boyfriend and usually he has to break in his shoes because he wears a size 13 4E. He LOVES these shoes. He says they're really really comfortable. It's a cool style, too."
1,Do not buy these shoes for running!,"I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years. I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992. I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit. The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there. The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width. The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992. I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all. What is that old adage? If it's not broke don't fix it. Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it? 991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you. I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe."
1,"992'S are a horrible shoe, beware, make sure you can return them",I absolutely agree with Brett A. Warner these replacements feel horrible . They don't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991's on. I bought them at a local store which did not take returns. So they just sit in the closet. If you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will. I wear a 11 1/2 B
3,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to owning my first pair of 99X's series shoes after all the favorable reviews. Just disappointed in them after putting about 40 miles on them so far. Not as well cushioned as the 1062's especially on the forefoot, the heel seems fine but the forefoot feels thin and firm to me when compared to my 1062's and Saucony rides (both of which were cheaper).Supposedly the 992's werent as well received as the 991's and the replacement 993's are supposed to correct whats wrong......so we'll see."
4,good shoes,"I can't say that these shoes look very nice, but they are awesome in comfort. If you have flat feet or knee pain these are the way to go. I will get a new pair every 300 miles. Oh, also, they are too expensive, so only 4 stars..."
4,Not too bad of a Shoe,"If you are new to the New Balance 99X line then you wont notice that these shoes are stiffer than the 991's. The 991's were the Cadillac of running shoes, your could wear them ALL day and suffer very little fatigue. The 992's have a stiffer sole and the overall quality of the shoe seems like it will last longer. The 991 had some cheaper plastic parts that liked to crack and fall off.991 pros; comfortable, the better running shoe, cheaper992 pros; not quite as comfortable but still better than most, will last longer, looks more stylishFor those of you trying to choose between these and another brand, remember that these shoes are made in the USA and not by sweat shop workers in another country. They both hold up very well over the long run compared to other brands."
1,Time To Find A New Favorite,"I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had. The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991. My foot slides around everywhere. I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first. Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991."
1,Sizing chart misleading,bought according to amazon sizing chart. one size too big. returned and ordered a smaller size. the sizing chart is misleading. check new balance sizing chart if you need to convert US size to the rest of the world.
2,Far Inferior to 991!,"I have always been a New Balance fan, and the 991 was the best running shoe I've ever owned. To my absolute astonishment, the 992 proved to be a far inferior product, and now I'm searching for a replacement. Stay away from the 992!"
3,the handle grips,"it was great while it lasted. im in the military. portability isnt much of an issue, i shoved system and handles into my cargo pocket. the handles only lasted a couple months. i bought em in mid april. Mid june something shorted on them. the handles started smoking and the support bars on the back melted the plastic. i do recommend the handles. and like someone else said, those pieces that hold the system on. the dont bend they break. ive been sittin for last month on 3 of those arms. NYKO should of made them either spring enforced so as to bend."
1,PSP Charger broke,It doesn't really help like it should. The PSP keeps falling out and eventually the piece that's suppose to lock it in broke. I don't like this product
4,Spell It Out,"Lanky's ""Inner Onwriter"" is a driving burst of rock energy. The opener ""Aeroplanes"" explodes with chiming guitars and a propulsive beat, ""I wanna forget like there's no need to remember, I wanna lose track of the years & the things I found."" ""Firecracker"" pops & sizzles with a restless energy and an airy falsetto. As a vocalist, Lanky has an expressive delivery complimented by the melodic sense of his rock & roll such as on ""Sympathy,"" ""The shouting just cuts through the wall; the words they just spell it all out."" The CD closes with an unaccredited 10th track, an instrumental with cello and strumming electric guitar. ""Inner Onwriter"" is an excellent debut that contains two-thirds rockers and one-third slower tunes. It's an impressive beginning. Enjoy!"
2,another generalization,"I got this book in hopes it would improve my riding long distance. But its just another book on generalizations and an excuse to picture long distance riders. A better purchase is Dale Coyners ""The essential guide to Motorcycle Travel"" unless your goal is to ride real far in a real short time which IMO is not that much fun."
5,Great tips on gearing up for riding long distances,"Very informative book on long distance riding, I picked up a lot of useful information from the book."
4,Fun book,"Fun book to read. Not practical for me as I'm not much of a long distance rider, but lots of good information that I can apply to my riding."
3,This was a great book - in it's day,"This book has a lot of great information for long distance riding that Iron Butt Association riders are known for. However, the book is now 11 years old and technology has passed much of the information in this book by. There still is good information on the non-technical things as riding a motorcycle long distance is still the rider and the machine and this book can still help you prepare. The equipment, clothing, GPS, computers, computer software for routing, and bike accessories have all improved. Yes, Motorcycles have improved but that is relative as long distance riders use all kinds of bikes new and old. If Ron Ayres would write an update matching the technology it would be greatly welcomed and it would be worthy of 5 Stars I'm sure."
5,Chris LeDoux--A True Cowboy,"This is the ultimate Chris LeDoux collection of his later music, after he gained widespread fame by being mentioned as one of Garth Brooks' influences. If you like classic country music, without frills and too many ""rock and roll"" riffs, you'll love this collection. Of course, if you've ever seen Chris in concert, you know that he can rock with the best of them, however, he has always remained true to his Western roots. I've been seeing him in concert nearly every year since 1990, and he is a perennial favorite, especially here in my home state. Having also met him once, he's a true gentleman and an old-fashioned cowboy through and through. If you want a taste of his earlier work, I'd also recommend the ""American Cowboy"" boxed set, featuring music he performed in his earlier career and back when he was a rodeo champion. An honest, straightforward approach has worked for him all these years, and he's never changed that. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!"
5,Product Review,This comprehensive collection had every song I could imagine you would want from Chris.
4,the capitol collection,"I was disappointed in the fact that I already had 3 of the CD's. I feel it was unclear in the description what all the CD's were. I thought it would be a ""collection"" on 6 CD's, instead it was 6 separate CD's that had already been released."
3,"its good,but not great","why do 2 box sets that overlap each other? this set has (atleast) 10 cuts you can find on the American Cowboy set, now yes, there are the other good cuts that are on here (the Stampede cd, for example, is awesome). But in my mind, if you want his best stuff,just get AC since it gives a better (and more rounded) view of his carreer"
1,"did not do anything, bad construction","Well, this item didn't do a thing for the noise I still have on my car speakers, tried installing it as per the instructions AND how a few reviewers mentioned, but no dice. I cracked it open to see what kind of suppressor was in the shell and to my surprise, it was a very VERY cheaply put together piece. The suppressor that my inexpensive car head unit has is way better constructed... suffice to say, it went in the trash bin..."
1,does not work.,After installing a cheap amplifier my speakers started to make a noise that would correlate with the engine RPM. After reading all the review I was very hopeful. but there were no changes in the noise. Tried everything but no change. :-(
1,Was good while it last,This was a good part for apart 1 week.. then it burned up.. So will have to look for something better..
3,Still have noise coming through line.,"The product had a great price, and seller had very fast shipping. It did cut down on some of the noise coming through my speakers, but I still get some humming from my engine.I would recommend the product and the seller for anyone interested. I just needed a larger suppressor for my application."
4,Noise suppressor,This is a good product. It does what it is advertised to do. Very Simple installation. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs to eliminate 12 volt hum from accessories.
1,Did Nothing,"After I determined that my problem was NOT a ground loop, I purchased and installed this product.It did absolutely nothing."
5,Works,Have had a really terrible ground noise with my FM modulator since I installed it. Put the noise suppressor in line and the noise is completely gone.
4,Ignition noise and whine is gone!,"Pretty good, even around 5 pm as the sun was setting I could pick upChicago 720 from 500 miles away. Not perfect, no, but its an aftermarketreceiver, the main thing was to shut down the alternator whine and clickingI had before. Now I can actually hear AM at night and local stations comethrough ok in the daytime. Also no noticeable difference on FM at all. Wellworth the purchase."
3,Did not work for me,"I purchased three different noise reducing devices for my car stereo amp. None of the in line noise suppressors seemed to make any difference, but the PAC SNI1 Noise Isolator fixed my problem. I can't say this is a bad product though, just not for me I guess."
3,Inline suppressor,"It seems to work fine enough. I have one on each channel. Still have some line noise on my Kia Sportage while it's running. I also have the antenna suppressor, which only helps a bit more. Seems to be a Sportage problem, as the OEM stereo whined on am. I will say that these ""cleaned"" up the sound. Not worth more than 8 bucks."
1,READ ME,"I wrote this as a 1 star for all those who read the bad reviews and decided not to buy this product. This will only fix 1.....1 type of noise that could be in your system. There are a lot of sources of unwanted noise in a automotive audio, so before you buy anything I would check this out and find out what the real problem is [...]"
1,useless,POS this thing did not take out my alternator whine one freakin bit no matter what stupid configuration i used. PS its big and ugly and pathetic.
3,very contemporary,This is a great collection of new ways to dress up SS SueGreat book for SS Sue enthusiast.
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"To begin with, Boxwave didn't ship for several days after my order. When I got the item, the top didn't come off and I can't get to the ballpoint pen. There is no phone number on the Boxwave site. So I've sent them an email.The reset pin is fine and the stylus part seems OK too. But that's not worth the price without the ballpoint. This item is a piece of junk.I would not recommend this company or this item. Chances are, I'll return this."
3,Not quite what I wanted,Nice and easy to use. Handle is longer than my utility drawer so its hard to put it away. Sturdy though.
2,Acronis Experiences,"I am a current user of Acronis Disk Director Suite, Version 10. The partitioning feature of this product is very intuitive and works without a hitch - even on RAID.The OS Selector feature appears to be very buggy and looks like a quick & dirty add-on.The documentation on their web-site is minimal at best.Support is via E-MAIL only, takes a number of days, and they don't really answer your questions. They don't answer their forums either. The forum appears to be supported by their users for the most part and everyone is guessing.I would have expected far more from a comercial product - you are much better off using open-source offerings than this product. There doesn't seem to be a way to request a refund either so unless you know someone that has managed to get it working right - I would recommend trying something else like plain old GRUB or LILO."
5,Highly recommended to all Christians,"Do not be deceived by this title. This book rocks. Never have I seen a more concise and clear history of the church ever. Even though the focus of this book is the history of the Roman Catholic Church, I recommend it to all Christians as it teaches a very easy to read walk through of history of the church. It includes everything of how church has evolved and the reasons for the many schisms within the church. No denomination bashing here. Gilles is both Catholic and a historian, but his writings are heavily researched, and includes many truths that all Christians especially Catholics should know. Papal heresies, battle for power and land, theological schisms, and much much more. I have read many books and never have I seen someone be willing to put so much historical truth about the church. Five Stars"
1,Really?,"This book reeks of the 1970's. Even its title is based in what was then a very popular expression, based in very liberal theology. This book assumes the worst of the Catholic Church in all eras--never mind real historical events. Save your money. If you want real church history, tryThe Catholic Church, the First 2000 Years: A Popular Survey and Study Guide to Church History. It will give both good and bad in an accurate fashion. The People of God does not."
1,"Not for cats, only suckers","I purchased 2 of these. I was so excited when they arrived that I think I opened the box before the UPS guy got back in his truck. I set them up and waited. My cat came out from under the bed as if it were food I had put down for her. She sniffed it and walked on it. I moved it and she followed it. Where ever I put it, she went. They should let you know that the product might have a reverse effect. Garbage!!!"
1,Only for pets that are missing limbs,I was so excited when my mammoth extra x-mat pet training matS arrived that I had the box opened before the Fedex guy got in his truck. What a piece of crap!!! The only way that this item woul work is if I covered the whole house with it or if my cat was missing a limb. It didn't even work a little bit. She just jumped over them like they were puddles of water. I even tried putting them in front of a doorway to keep her out of a room. YEAH RIGHT!! Don't buy this. You have been warned! GARBAGE.
3,Could be better,"After owning 3 of these mats for about 5 years now, my cat mocks these. She frequently sits/stands/lays on them (on top of the sofa). She's a pretty fluffy cat, so maybe it's more ""massaging"" than annoying for her?! They might work for you, but I will not buy again."
5,Great product!,X-mat is a great product! Now my cats don't jump onto my couch where the x-mat is placed. It's a three-seat couch so I'm trying to move the x-mat from one seat to another and see if it could train the cats so that they eventually don't jump onto the couch at all.
2,Too simplistic,"The language is easy to read, but the precious details are few and far between.I expected a lot more for this price."
4,A great blowing session!,"This Parisian up and comer has claimed a bit of space on this, her first solo disk. At 29, Alour has a pretty sophisticated head for compositions in the vein of Joe Henderson and Dave Holland and a sound reminiscent of the terrific Holland/Dave Douglas Sextet Tenor man Chris Potter.This disk is organ and guitar infused and features a trove of similar minded France-based players and a strong cover of Joe Henderson's ""Black Narcissus""...a tad shy of 5-Stars, but she has to have somewhere to go!A really good intro to a fresh European talent!"
2,"o'k movie, DVD quality is horrible","I suppose it is not a bad movie. But to understand this, one needs to see it - which is all but impossible with this DVD. Obviously the image was transferred from a bad quality VHS without any corrections made to the picture. The screen is dark, everything is foggy and even scratchy a bit. It is quite a disspointment as the cast is interesting, the characters exotic and the period is one not often covered in any movies."
1,Romance of a Horsethief,"I remember seeing this film years ago and enjoyed it, but the DVD I bought through Amazon (from a third party seller) was unwatchable. It wouldn't play in either of my DVD's or my computer. The DVD case artwork and the DVD itself looked to be low-quality productions. Looked like a bootleg. I returned it.I would like to see this film released in high-quality by the original studio/production company"
4,ROMANCE OF A HORSETHIEF,"NOT THE BEST YUL BRYNNER MOVIE,.. BUT IT IS HUMOROUS AND IT ALSO HAS ELI WALLACH IN THE MOVIE.BEST YUL BRYNNER MOVIES ARE WESTWORLD, MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, ULTIMATE WARRIOR (BEST)!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Was not pleased,"I was excited about receiving my boxers as i am a lover of them. Upon receiving the items, i was dissappointed to find out that all of the boxers were WHITE in color. This was a suprise as i didnt order the WHITE, they were suppose to be assorted colors. So this in all made the purchase a real let down for me. If i clicked on assorted colors, then i expect to receive assorted colors boxers, to which i did not. So be careful in making sure that u get the colors that u ask for."
3,Good for the price not for quality,"I bought these because were i live, Dominican Republic, named brand clothes are expensive, however, this time the dissapointment came when i used them for the second time they had already lost their flexibility and were loose at leg level. These are budget unides that you can use them and just toss them away in a few months."
3,Hanes Boxer Briefs P4 Value,The briefs are cheaply made but then I think I got what I paid for. They were the least expensive. I've purchased other Hanes boxer briefs that were of higher quality and they fit well and lasted a lot longer than what I think these ones will.
1,Poor Quality,"Not the best quality!! Don't buy it. Feels like burlap sap material. So unless you want to use them as rags, stay away!!"
5,Great Sexy Feel,"They may not be the sexy feel that most go after nowadays, but I still love my Hanes and they come in just Grey and Black and are quite inexpensive! :D"
5,always been my fave,the best of both worlds (being boxers and briefs)- i'm a big guy and these have fit me the best out of all brands I've tried.
4,Sooo cute!,I love these shoes! They're really cute in person and they're padded so they're actually pretty comfortable. A little tight in the toes but I do have wide feet.
5,"Sexy, sexy","Knowing that I can not walk in heels, I went ahead and ordered these shoes. You wonder why...and my answer is this. Sex appeal. As a curvy girl, you have to get the attention somehow, so why not hot pink, 5 inch patent leather stillettos? Sit there on a plush sofa in the bar, cosmo in hand, leg over leg, with these sexy shoes on your feet. Make sure to smoke a Djarum Black clove cigarette to create a mysterious scent that draws people to you. Sex appeal is a mixture of confidence, and these shoes. No man is able to resist a woman in sexy heels. And if you're like me, make sure to carry your sandals in your bag for when you actually have to get off that plush sofa. These shoes are comfortable for sitting...but depending on your high heel ability, maybe not for walking."
1,poorly made product,lost a stone on the first day and the chain broke a few days after that. very disappointed.
5,"Of the two books that I never shelve, this is one.","As a PC Windows programmer suddenly thrust into the UNIX world, I felt like I was lost in ""a dark and dreary wilderness."" With this book at my side, the daily mechanics of the UNIX world quickly became second nature to me. Especially well-thumbed sections so far: Unix Commands, Bourne and Korn shell, vi (this section alone justifies the purchase of the book), and make. By the way, the other book I never put away is a monumental and indispensible desk reference called ""Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment"" by W. Richard Stevens."
4,Good for ideas,"Although I'm from Australia and struggled with some of his more American comments, this book simply has too many ideas for an indie band not to pick up. It's not perfect and if you're looking for a specific guide as to what you should do to promote your band you should look elsewhere, but for someone who just needs that one creative spark to get them going, it's perfect."
5,Kind of a Bible of music markentig,"Great book, Bob knows the market, how it works and the next steps too. I recommend!"
5,For every musician,"Every serious musician should read this book. It has some great ideas. It helps you start thinking out of the box, specially if you're focused only on making music. Marketing music is also part of the game so I can only recomend reading this one."
3,Some good advice,This book gives some good advice but like the previous reviewer said it doesn't go into enough details. I would much prefer a book that would give more step by step instructions (I guess I am just a linear thinker). I also think there could have been more on internet marketing as that seems to be the best way to go these days.All in all a good resource but you will probably need more than just this to really get going.
4,This Book Is A Must Own For Aspiring Musicians,"If you are in a band or you're thinking of starting one, this is the book for you. However, if you're a songwriter/composer like myself, it mainly serves as a good resource to have for web site ideas and some marketing ideas. Most of the content in this book is in reference to bands and the needs of a band. Still, I highly recommend it to anyone that's looking to boost/add to their musical aspirations."
3,Elizabeth L,"I'm an independent musician and while I definitely found this book helpful, there were just too many stories/examples for my tastes. Not enough of them applied to my band and it seemed to be a way to lengthen the book after I'd gone through enough of them. That being said, if you're starting out especially, you will get not only all the basics but a lot of good new promotion ideas and it will get you thinking outside the box. This is a book every indie musician should at least check out."
5,One of the Best Black Metal bands of all time!!!,"I am a very big black metal fan and its hard to find some good black metal music that isnt turning into a mainstream band. Anyway Dark Funeral isnt one of those bands. Dark Funeral is still to this day one of the best black metal bands around. This cd proves it. There past recording have been not top quality sounding and made it hard to hear whats really going on. But with this recording they play there best songs from Diabolis Interium all the way to The Secrets Of The Black Arts albums. Its an amazing show and I wish I was there to see it. It would have been great if they were to film this show for a DVD because I would have loved to have seen it. If you are fans of Mayhem, Emperor, Dimmu Borgir, Darkthrone, Bathory and Immortal you will love these guys! You should also pick up there latest album Attera Totus Sanctus its just another great album from this great Black Metal band!!!"
5,Even better than Blue Mercy!,"I was looking forward to reading this sequel to Blue Mercy, especially after reading its preview at the end of the first book. I was not disappointed. The first book spends time building the bare facts of the characters' lives. The sequel adds depth to both Kay and Finn and also introduces some new characters in a really interesting supporting cast.Another reviewer used the word ""tense"" to describe the plot development and I have to agree. This book is tighter wound than the first, with even more of the details that fans of police procedurals live for.There is a great cliffhanger in the side plot that will have me eagerly looking for the next installment!"
3,The Ending was GREAT,"I agree with at least one reviewer that the main character does need some character development. I was not too ""keen"" on her. And the story just trudged along in the typical ""serial"" killer style - which lead me to believe that the ending would be VERY predictable - so predictable that I actually skipped several pages and ALMOST tossed the book - but as I don't like anything ""unfinished"" - I did read it to the end and was MOST surprised by the TWIST. If you can get past the ""melodrama"" and the ""other"" case - which certainly did NOT need to be included - you'll enjoy the ending. I'll probably NOT buy any more books by this author if her main character is the same - much to shallow an individual to keep track of."
4,Good Fantasy/Romance,"Gemini Moon was a good romance with a Fantasy background. I'm usually a skeptic and the story has to be realistic for me to enjoy. This fantasy was well written and the love story was pretty good, yet predictable. I enjoyed the Fantasy World of Tareth more than the love story, the characters had a bit of historical romance feel to it, which I did like very much. The characters were well defined and the story had a good flow. It was a good read."
3,an ok book,I had this book for free because usually I don't read this kind of book. The story was imaginative and great but I think it could be better with a bit of editing. Some parts drag on and on and the parts where Ash think about Cathy's and Katrina's destiny are repetitive. The begining is a bit slow but once you read 1/3 of the book the story begins to be really interesting.
3,OK if you dont mind skipping through,"This was just an o.k. book. I had a really hard time reading through all of it. I have to admit that I skipped quite a bit. The overall story ws great, but there were parts that just dragged on and on. So although I wouldn't read it again or reccomend it to anyone like I said it was o.k."
1,What a bore!!,"I skipped to the end on this one. A prince dumps a beautiful princess for a plain jane cripple, yeah right! Later plain jane cripple has to give up her soul so that the handsome prince and beautiful princess can live happily ever after, yeah right! Plain jane cripple at the end is ever so happy about the entire thing, yeah right! I am all about the fantasy not the ridiculous. Don't even waist your time downloading this freebie."
2,Long and Boring!,"The story is long and boring with too many unnecessary details. The author just wan to drag on the story. I only read the first five chapters and the last two chapters. We can all guess how it's going to end. Prince Ash goes to earth to find Princess Katrina's soul, which is in Cathy. And of course he will succeed in bringing her back to his earth and return her soul to Princess Katrina. And of course, they would live happily ever after. It's pretty typical, with nothing new."
2,Bits of imagination amidst the plodding,"Good thing this was a free Kindle ebook, because for some reason I thought I was downloading a Science Fiction novel. I should have paid more attention to the reviews- might have noticed that this is actually a 'romance novel'. It's somewhat imaginative but filled with repetitive, often ridiculous, soft-core situations, about one a page. Read this if you love the old-fashioned 'bodice ripper' genre."
1,"leaks so bad, it completely empties itself","I have never had a iron that leaked so bad, I fill it up to use, and it leaks until it is empty on my ironing board. I only use it as a dry iron now."
5,The Best!,"This is the best iron I've ever owned! I've own cheap and I've owned the pricier one, but this one is best. No leaking either!"
4,I think it's a great iron!,"Regardless of what the other reviewer said, I Love my iron! It is extremely ""smart"" and I am not very smart when trying to figure out what the temp. should be. This does it all for me! Thanks black and decker!"
3,"Good with Windows XP, but not with ME","Initially I bought this to run with Windows XP and Windows Me since they are both listed as being supported by Amazon. But, after speaking with Sony tech support I have found that Acid 4.0 is not fully functional with Windows ME. When you run this on a Windows ME system, you can not Render a project to a MP3 file. This is becuase there are no supported templates for MP3 for Acid 4.0 with Windows ME. Also, it locks up my system periodically when I try to do live recordings. But, with Windows XP it works fine. And, if you have a Sony VAIO system that came preinstalled with the Deluxe versions of Acid and SoundForge, be advised that the base Acid 4.0 and SoundForge 1.1 do not have the same capabilities. You will have to update Acid 4.0 and SoundForge so you can perform the same tasks as the pre installed software on your Sony VAIO. However, I do like the multi-track editor."
1,you get what you pay for...,this software sucks! first when you get it the samples are so freakin' cheesy and when you want cool loops you have to get on Sony's website and buy them seperately (what a rip off!)Buy the other Acid pro thats 250 bucks ITS SEMI COOL.SONY YOU CHEAP RIP OFF!
5,Best Pregnancy Pillow,"This pillow is amazing and has helped me sleep great all throughout my pregnancy. You can adjust it to fit your body exactly where you need the support. It's better than the body pillow because it gives you support on your back where you really need it when you are pregnant. I put the bottom of the U by my feet and use my reglar pillows. It's great to wrap my legs around it, or my knees in the front and my feet hit the backside. It has a great cover that zips off so that you can wash it. You won't be dissappointed with this pillow. Who would have known that this would make sleeping pleasant, even while being pregnant?"
4,Bird book 1,Good book for a beginner like me with good photography. Same problem as others though in that no one book has them all so you will need to buy a couple books to cover all the bases.
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. This woman has the luxury of going off and leaving her husband for a year to find herself. Most of us find ourselves in the loving of others. This poor soul is one lost soul and does not have any wisdom to give. She got a lot from her friend she met at the beach, but she is a pretty shallow, ungrateful person. I feel sorry for the poor husband as she rushes off to give her seminars and women are lining up to fill up the emptiness. My husband died, and I loved every day with him. I only wish I could still have his love and companionship. He helped me to be the person I am. Maybe this woman married for the wrong reason. Love heals, deep love nourishes. I feel she is self centered.California"
2,Waste of Money,"I found the book so boring after the first chapter. So I speed read the rest of the chapters hoping to find something interesting. I can't say much about it because I kept asking myself why I bought this ridiculous book of mundane advice. I could not connect to this book at all. I have lived in other countries and U.S. territories. I have spent years in the Caribbean. Those experiences have changed my life in positive ways, but I could not relate it in any way to this book."
4,Inspirational read,I enjoyed this book on CD. I think that if you are looking to get motivated to start anew this book is helpful and inspirational. I had zero expectations so that is helpful. Book reminded me to put my needs first again.
4,Still too quiet,"Fits nicely onto my ear, but I still sound distant over the connection. I'm still using it tho because I haven't found anything to do it better, certainly not the Panasonic KX-TCA93."
3,Jeannie before success,"Harper Valley P.T.A. and this album ""The Songs of Jeannie C. Riley"" both came out in 1968. This was demo work that Little Darlin' put out after her Harper success. My two favorite songs from this album and from her in general are the sassy The Price I pay to Stay and The Heart he Kicks Around.Jeannie wrote two ok songs from this album I'll be a Woman of the World and How can anything so right be so wrong. She wouldn't write her own songs again till she joined MGM in the 70's. In some ways this album sounds more like traditional country than her Plantation work but the songs are less memorable. After all Tom T. Hall wrote some of her best songs. This is hardly Jeannie's best album but since it's one of the few on the market it's worth picking up."
1,A complete abomination. ..,"They (whomever ""They"" are), butchered this album on its cd release. If you can find a copy of the original LP on Little Darlin' buy it! A great album that has been completely destroyed with new mixes and an omission of an original track. The sound is cheap and the remixed tracks are an insult to the integrity of the original work. There's a great saying that goes ""If it ain't broke... don't fix it!) ""They"" could learn from that!This CD is a waste of your money and time even if it were a penny."
3,Applet Source Files,"I just purchased the book. I downloadthe files of this book from the publisher website. I noticethat applet demonstration workshops in the book only containclass files and html files. I just wonder if the originaljava source files for applet workshops can also be posted in thepublisher website, which will facilitate the learning process,since readers can modify the soruce files, and to see how theapplet results might change."
3,Does not cover generics,"I do not own this book but am in the process of choosing a text for a CS2 data structures course (using Java for projects and examples). After downloading the examples, I noticed that the text does not cover Java generics. This is a showstopper for me although the book looks promising otherwise."
2,No Java source codes available,"One major problem with this book, particularly for beginners like me, is that the Java source codes are UNAVAILABLE. To try the code in the book, you have to type, which obviously is a tremendous wate of time and frustration. There are no alternative. Hope that the author may immediately act to resolve the issue. Considering the amount of frustration that I have gone through, even two stars are a generous rating for this book. Now I am looking for other data structure books which are rated good and provide source codes."
4,Good Introduction to Data Structures,"This book is a good introduction to data structures, and would do nicely as an undergraduate college text. It does not have the rigor, however, for an advanced data structures class as might be expected in graduate-level courses. While the author provides plenty of pictures and descriptions to run online applets, the applets were nearly impossible to find on the web. They are not at the location as stated in the book. Even without using the applets though, there are plenty of good diagrams in the book to follow.So, get this book if you want a nice introduction to the most common data structures, but don't get this book if you are looking for the ""end-all"" of data structures, or a rigorous approach to defining the complexity/performance associated with the data structures; You'll have to look elsewhere for that."
3,Good book for beginners BUT....,I found this book to be very useful to learn data structures even with minimum Java knowledge. The chapters are well written so that it's very easy to understand the matter quickly.BUT: Many of the source codes are incomplete or even missing! I have no problem with typing source code from the book but if the author shows source codes where important methods are missing (delete method on 2-3-4 Trees) or even whole data structures are only explained in theory (Red Black Trees) without any piece of source code and at the end of the chapter tells us to find such stuff out by ourself I'm starting to wonder what do I paid the 45$ for?! I don't need a book for telling me to try to find out stuff by myself! I'm buying a book exactly for the matter to tell me the things that I can't find out by myself!
4,Quite a Good Book,"I've only been using the book for about a month. However, it's straightforward explanations and well-organized structure, as well as somewhat informal diction presents a welcome juxtaposition between rigor and clarity. One of the better data structure books out there. More on the algebra and calculus of Big-O notation would be helpful though, because that is one of the areas in which I've been struggling."
4,Back to college!,"Great, but intense brush up on Java for those interviewing with Google, Microsoft, Amazon or any of the other ""rigorous interview"" tech companies."
3,wolo permanent mount,"bought this wolo model 3600-A power beam about a year ago, all the rotating bulbs burned out and can not find the replacement for it."
2,"Good sound, very uncomfortable","Pro: I just bought this headset to use with my Motorola E815 and the sound is great. Very cool to listen to songs with my cell phone.Con: Ear buds actually hurt my ears. They are very hard to keep in, especially the left one which always falls out and I can't keep them in for very long.I'm looking for a replacement but haven't been able to find a compatible set?"
2,They're OK,Received a pair with my MPX220. They fit in the ear fine but do sometimes have the potential to fall out. Average sound quality. The button I guess is somewhat cool.
4,Motorola Headset for i875,"So far so good. I have the i875 and about a 2 weeks after my purchase the headset that came with the phone became non-functional. I called the Motorola warranty department for a week straight and were constantly told they are upgrading their systems. I came across the earpiece on Amazon and ordered through A1 accessories..>I was a little skeptical, but Amazon and A1 provided me with a speedy delivery of my product,which I did not doubt. My doubts were the functionality of the earpiece and to my surprise, it works perfectly and Im glad I purchased 2. This confirmed that I will make additional purchases in the future."
5,Thoroughly balanced yet exciting,"I highly recommend this book for all serious Christians, from priests and pastors to laymen. We need more honest work of this nature, both in writing and in our lives."
5,Truly Useful,If you are on the track of getting to know God and learning to hear his voice...this book is for you. Jack Deere has the wonderful background of being Baptist and Manuscript oriented and then getting holy spirit baptized and being one with the Holy Spirit as well. Bapticostals tend to have a great perspective and balance on these things and Jack Deere is a great example of this. I highly recomend.
2,Poor Argument backed by bad interpretation,"Deere takes an experience in his life and tries to turn it into normative Christianity. To do this, he must do bad interpretation of several passages of the Bible. What follows is a bad and dangerous argument for elevating personal ""revelation"" from God that is (as he admits) often wrong to the same level as the Bible. The book has some good points, and certainly asks great questions about revelation outside of the Bible, but Deere never finds the answer to the question."
1,"If you like cults, you'll love this book","After browsing through this book and realizing many of the things Jack was saying couldn't be backed up with scripture, I decided to do some research on him. Please, Please, Please, do a simple search on yahoo.com under his name. You will read countless reports of how the gospel he is teaching is far different from the gospel of Christ. He uses his time at Dallas Theological Seminary to boost his credibility, but they have acknowledged his time there was long before he got into a cult movement. Please be very weary...."
4,I felt part of the experience,The straightforward account held me spellbound. I felt the author/reader had an honest heart and had no choice but to pursue his quest. The telling of his experiences was informative and interesting. I was captivated and wished the book hadn't ended.
3,would have been nice to have some dates,"The author seems to be striving for a timeless quality in his prose, but it is really annoying that there aren't any dates in the book. Did he take these trips in the 1970s? 1980s? 1990s? He says ""we knew that in the future birds will be tracked by satellites"", but when was that?If you're an airplane pilot, you'll be horrified by the chances that these guys took in a really beat-up Cessna 172. They seem to have done some long-distance flying without being instrument-equipped or rated and naturally got themselves into some dangerous scrapes with the weather. The author seems to have no idea how unnecessary this kind of risk-taking is.The book would have made a really great 25-page New Yorker magazine article."
3,Macintalk voices never souded so sexy!!,"When I first heard this track I was shocked! Hey!! Those are Victoria and Ralph's voices from the Apple Macintosh's built in Macintalk synthetic voices!! LOL! Very catchy track, driving beat and oh yes btw it has a great video! ;-)"
2,NOT A BOOK FOR READERS...,"Those looking for a book on heraldic design, accompanied by text on its historical development and meaning, will be disappointed. While there is some text that accompanies the forty full color plates which are the highlight of this book, it is merely plate specific. Other than the brief introduction that appears at the beginning, there is really nothing substantive for the reader. It is, in essence, a poster book, as it devoid of any meaningful text. If one is a rabid fan of heraldic design, however, then perhaps one should add an additional star to my rating."
3,"you have to read it, it is samll","I had read it, it is good, and i think it is urgent for anyone want to build a Web page, gave you some nice ideas, it talk about almost everything in Internet in general."
4,A Queen Indeed!,"I first heard Esma in the film ""Gypsy Caravan"" and was enthralled immediately. This CD is a wonderful sampling of Macedonian and Romani songs. It should please anyone interested in gypsy music. I would highly reccomend it."
5,"well, a vampire story...","Probably was one of few vampire books out in the early 80's along with Anne Rice. Some people, at the time, ate these books up, but it took me another 20 years to find them. I was reading other stuff. Now, I'm so glad I found Fevre Dream. What a pleasure to listen to a wordcrafter like George R.R. Martin. A great story, a classic."
3,A perfectly acceptable modern vampire story.,"The thing that makes it most interesting is that it was released in 1987, before the surge in vampire popularity that brought us Vampire: the Masquerade, Buffy, and Twilight. Written well enough; it's a quick read, but nothing that demands too much attention or thought."
4,Vampire Beach Read,"This was a perfectly good vampire beach read. It starts out in 1857 and is mostly on and around steamboats on the Mississippi River. There is not a lot of character development so the author is just telling a story. Some readers might want this book to move faster but I was ok with the pace. The main character is a rough edged river boat captain. He's not a guy you're going to fall in love with. This is set during the era of slavery in the south. There is use of the ""N word"" and some general disregard for slaves which could be disagreeable to some. It is in keeping with the story and the era. If your expectations are for a quick little vampire read then you won't be disappointed."
5,Very good book in dark fantasy,I bought this book because I missed the Martin`s stile after reading Game of Thrones five volumes. I don`t regret it!
4,An interesting take on vampires.,"A good mix of historical fiction and dark fantasy. I learned quit a lot about the ""Great steam boat"" era on the Mississippi river and it's many tributaries. A good read."
4,"Not Game of Thrones, but still entertaining and well written","This is the work of a younger George R.R. Martin. Its no match for any of the volumes in the Song of Ice and Fire series, but it's a lovely, historically beautiful, vampire feast!"
5,Fevre Dream,Totally different from Game of Thrones but just as original and well written. The second half of the book is impossible to put down.
3,Good....but not the Martin you expect,"If you love the ""Game of Thrones"" books (which I do) and want to read more George RR Martin then that's cool. However, this book is not in the same category - in terms of subject, depth, or maturity. It's a good book....just not at the same level. Don't let others who rate it 4 or 5 stars fool you. I enjoyed it...but if it was written by Joe Smith, I wouldn't consider his other books ""must reads."" I read it about a year ago and was just browsing Amazon and saw that it was added to my recommended list. I was surprised it had such a high rating and figure it was due to a bunch of Martin fans. It was written quite a while ago and just doesn't match the brilliance of his current series."
2,Fevre Dream??,"I am an avid George R.R. Martin fan, but I was really disappointed with this graphic novel. First, the story seemed contrived and second the illustrations were awful.Write full novels George!"
4,Someone should tell George....,"...The Old Abe was a Republican, too (to quote the novel, ""Marsh voted for him, despite being a Republican"").Other than that, another example of George R.'s finest: excellent storytelling, terrible story. By that I don't mean that the characters were poorly developed, the plot was thing, nor that the writing was bad. Only that he is just too damn depressing. It really makes one wonder WHY you'd want to read it."
4,Riviting,"This story, which presents is a completely different slant on the ""Vampire Myth"" wasa good read. A thought provoking, scary and a difficult to put down book"
1,Wish I Could Have My Money Back.,"As I said in my review title, I wish I could gst a refund. Very slow, very plodding novel. It took a great effort on my part to finish the book."
2,A comic book? Really!,"I guess graphic novel is another name for comic book. Having never heard the term before I made this purchase based on the author and his Song of Ice and Fire series. While I anticipated reading a George R.R. Martin novel about vampires, I purchased a comic book. Remember graphic novel is not a novel."
4,Elegant and complex,"Fevre Dream is an excellent, spell binding book. The narative is gripping and the good versus evil theme is primary, with the vampires in it almost coincidentally. It could have been serial killers and been as effective. But it was vampires and thus it should rank in the top of the vampire literature ranks.This did remind me a lot of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter in that it was set over the same time fram.Abner and Joshua are both sympathetic characters.A simply hard-to-put-down book. I highly recommend it!"
3,still good,"I love George R.R. Martin's work. His creative mind continues to keep me swiping the kindle pages for hours. With his attention to detail on Fever Dream I now feel like I could pilot a stream boat. But at times the overwhelming detail seemed to slow down the story.I like how this story portrays vampires on a different light; they are more of a different race than a different species. The character Abner Marsh is not what you would expect from a lead character, and his life well suck you in to his world. All the main characters are so real I felt like I could tell you details about their lives that aren't mentioned on the story. Sometimes I even felt I understood where the antagonist were coming from."
2,"Riverboats, and, oh yea, some vampires","Not a terrible story. There's a lot of realism about vampires in there, although a bit different from Anne Rice. I didn't quite buy the way he explains the vampire's history. Oh and there was far too much about riverboats. In fact, it should of been called, ""A Tutorial on Riverboats, with some vampire murder stuff to make it interesting.""I didn't quite relate to any of the characters, and some were racist, to the point of being overly so. I see some of Fire and Ice stuff in here: lots of characters, nothing happy, lots of death. If you love riverboats and old New Orleans and slavery and death then this is the book for you.How many vampire books are there now? What's next: vampires in space?"
3,Not Convinced,"Period piece FEVRE DREAM could have been a wonderful read had it stuck to its horror agenda. As is, the novel is more of an adventure yarn than anything else. However, George R. R. Martin does a fine job fleshing out some of his characters, most especially the partner of his main one, Joshua York. His journey from a ""simple"" vampire to a self-made human being does make for a fine reading. Just as the author's atmospheric hold of things do give chills once or twice. The main problem with the novel is the in-between action sequences that never ends. Just when finally everything starts picking up speed, we're back to a wordy (but very well-written) stance about ships and the many shades of the river. This form of attention picking goes on and on until the lengthy but still effective climax. Pick FEVRE DREAM up if only you dig this form of execution.-----Martin Boucher"
2,Wasn't enthralled.,"I really wanted this book to blow me away. Perhaps it's because I was first exposed to George R. R. Martin through his series ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" and was entranced entirely by the story and the characters. I suppose I expected the same caliber of work from all of his novels. ""Fevre Dream"" didn't live up to my expectations, sadly. It had the potential to be a very original and interesting take on classic vampire literature and lore, but I never felt as though the story flowed smoothly, nor did I feel any sort of connection to the characters. The entire book seemed rather flat and one-dimensional, with catalysts that felt forced rather than being natural progessions in the story. All-in-all, I was left feeling let down after finishing this novel, especially after paying $12 for it. I'd say stick with ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" for your George R. R. Martin needs."
5,Great Book.,Great book and I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something a little different then what what Martin normally writes.
2,Not Mr. Martin's normal story,This book was well written for the time period and had great detail but didn't catch my imagination like his other books have.
2,a book I had to make myself finish,He portrays his characters as intelligent and insightful and then writes this dribble. I could have gotten the same quality of writing from a classic comic book.
4,Attention GRRM Fans,"The book on this page is a graphic novel. Apparently from some other reviews this is not clear enough from the description. If you are looking to purchase this book based solely on your interest in George R. R. Martin, I would heartily recommend that you read the actual full length novel first:Fevre Dream.The book on this page, and the subject of this review, is a collection of the series of comic books based on Martin's novel. As such, it is put together quite nicely, with thick glossy pages, and bound nicely. The Signature Edition, limited to 1000 copies, features a simple autograph in black marker by the auther. I give it four stars because for what it is, I do consider it a bit over-priced. Who knows though, if they decide to make a movie out of this story it may be worth something someday.To sum up: read the original book first, then if you're interested in seeing it interpreted in graphic art, pick this one up as well."
4,Definitely Martin,"A very nicely written book. Those that have read Martin's recent stuff should enjoy. Although the setting is different from Ice and Fire, some elements remain, particularly his humor and penchant for violence and ugly people. Cheers."
3,Okay book that I wouldn't recommend to vampire aficionados.,"I have a soft spot for vampire novels/movies, and I really wanted to like this book, but it was a little slow for my tastes. The pacing towards the end was uneven, making the ending quite abrupt. The best part of the novel was the vivid imagery, description of the steamboats and colorful characters."
5,GRRM fix,"Desperate for a GRRM fix, I picked up Fevre Dream. Interesting twists, evocative narrative, deliciously chewy imagery, very enjoyable! Wish it had been longer. Enjoyed the protagonist especially, irascible, stubborn, courageous. GRRM writing himself, perhaps?"
4,Interesting Vampire book,I love George RR Martin so I gave this book a try and was pleasantly surprised. It is obviously not the caliber of his other books but a good read nonetheless. He has a refreshingly different take on the over-used vampire tale.
4,Breath of fresh air,"What an enjoyable read! Although, past indiscretions aside, I could not relate to the amoral ideas, the 'revaluation of values' was refreshing. Despite an early, curious contemptuous barb at Nietzsche in the book, this is his 'Overman' or 'Superman'!I particularly enjoy the scene where Sanin is visited by his sister's subduer and his comrade. I love how Sanin has the courage to say what is exactly on his mind (this in a time when it was completely improper!) regardless of the consequences. It makes you realize how absurd human behavior is insofar as the truth being the last thing anyone is really interested in!You may not agree with the philosophy in this book. I did not always. However, the important thing is to not take literature like this as a destructive promulgation of immorality but rather an open mind to a different view!"
3,fascinating but flawed,"The glimpse into a life that few of us understand was enthralling, but after awhile I couldn't care less about the characters. I finished it because I was hoping they would somehow redeem themselves. In Siddon's other stories her characters are deeply flawed but somehow we see why they are, and what they can't overcome. Here these folks have it all and still can't be decent human beings. I really had no sympathy for the moral lethargy of all of them."
3,Money does not always buy happiness.,The need for the seemingly endless detail in the first half of the book becomes obviously clear as the reader approaches the surprise ending.
5,THE southern novel of our generation.,"The inate enigma of being born a southerner is soperfectly portrayed in Peachtree Road, that it'sdown-right scary at times. The pathos, the hiddenagendas, the family skeletons and the agonies ofbeing either on the inside or the outside of thatcharmed but deadly world are revealed in characterswho lived just down the street from your Grandmother's house in old Buckhead. In a time andplace when appearances and backgrounds stillmattered the most Peachtree Road is a slice ofsouthern life that began to disappearwhen the first interstate highways started their wide swathsthrough Margaret Mitchell's Atlanta,and are now only memories. This isa MUST read for any born and bred southerner as wellas anyone who ever hopes to really know them!"
2,Too many beautiful words,"When a single sentence turns into a full paragraph, there are too many words, even if they are beautiful words. I found myself having to re-read frequently because my mind had wandered. Occasional glimpses of the story line were frustrating when followed by page after page of in-depth descriptions. I was excited about the book but I can't finish it. Very disappointing."
4,Siddons' Tour de Force,"I was so enchanted with this world: I suppose I'm a sucker for the upper classes, but even as I drooled over the lifestyle of the Buckhead Pinks and Gels, I could see the fear, sadness, tragedy, triumph all classes experience. I just enjoyed every description, every event, every person, and how how the story revolves around choices and consequences. I especially appreciated Siddons'effort to meaningfully portray mental illness, dysfunctional families, and love undone by selfishness. The treatment wasn't formula, characters and events often made you scratch your head, and that's the joy, to be surprised and tested by these people. Just a dynamite piece, this is something on which an author can rest her laurels."
2,A Talented Storyteller,"After having read several of Siddons' books, I have come to the conclusion that she is a marvelous storyteller. The reader is drawn in. On the other hand, I don't find her books to be very satisfying because her characters are so weak. They never seem to hesitate at making an immoral choice or betraying a friend. They always seem so self-centered. The only Siddons' character I would really like to know is Maude in Colony. There is tremendous talent here, but while I appreciate that good characters must be human, I like to be able to identify with the struggle to be better."
4,Southern fiction at its best.,"Like only this author can be. Lucy and Shep Bondurant are cousins that are clearly headed on a path to destruction from the opening chapter of this book. When Lucy comes to live in the Atlanta house with Gibbs's family she takes his heart and breath away. From this meeting of two lonely children a strong lifelong bond grows, one that will go beyond words and even death.Siddons writes with a style of her own, beautiful, rambling, expressive prose that leaves you feeling the heat and charm of Atlanta and it's nobility. Her characters are not always likable but they are intensely human, making them more than just cardboard cut heroes and heroines. I enjoy the incredible way this author puts the reader in the scene.I have enjoyed several of this authors book's. My favorite, and the jewel in her crown, as my friend Rachel once put it, is COLONY a book that will warm your heart for years to come. Kelsana 5/26/02"
1,LOOOONG boring setup for a plot that never goes anywhere,"The author spent the first half of the book switching between setting up the characters and foreshadowing the rest of the book. She takes long passages to describe places and even events that end up with no bearing on the story.I'm glad to see other reviewers saying that they were disappointed by this book because I bought two Siddons books at the same time. I hope I like the other book better than this one.THE ENDING: I think Shep jumps from the bridge landing safely in the water and then is finally able to have a relationship with Sarah. By reliving (and changing) the day at the bridge so long ago, he's able to symolically free himself of Lucy. I don't think he was suicidal at all."
1,Read only if you have a lot of time to waste,"This book had so much potential but it's almost confusing the way it spends more time forshadowing than telling the story. I'm about half-way through it and feel, only because of my OCD tendacies, I will continue to muddle through it."
2,Tiresome Read,"I found this book typically boring, hundreds of pages going back and forth over and over. Flash Foward, Flash Back. I never could really get a sense of all the characters - there were just too many. The book ends with unclear conclusions. I have read all of her books and felt that this one was a total waste of my time."
2,too much same information,"I am a big fan of Ann River Siddons but this book was way too long because she kept saying the same things over and over. She spent way too much time on, which I thought was the main character Lucy's, early years. I know these books are fiction, and I have read lots of fiction, but was hard to believe a girl under 10 or 11 would have such an infuence over these older boys. so much so that the book began to get so boring I had to put it down for a few weeks before I could finish it. I will read more books by this author, but will make sure not to buy any of her books with this many pages. By the way buying books on Amazon is so easy,and convenient. Everything is mailed to me right away, and they are just so polite as well as very professional.Lake Home Getta"
3,It`s Okay,"I found Peachtree Road too similar to A. Siddons novel ""Downtown"". As always though, she somehow managed to ensnare me and my imagination so that I was totally caught up in the story and at the end, sorry to part ways with the inhabitants of Peachtree Road."
4,"Slow start but builds to an exciting read,","This was the only Anne Rivers Siddons book I have read with a slow start. But, it eventually builds the tension level, and I was hooked. Ms. Siddons is quite adept at descriptions of southern locales, and she describes Atlanta in that time beautifully. Gibby, the narrator, wasn't always a hero just like the rest of us, but the main woman,(whose name I can't remember), needed to disappear about half way through the book. She became excessively tiresome."
4,Excellent Reference,Not for superficially interested persons. Excellent for what it is. I would suggest that if you are 'really' interested in the subject that you us this (and volume 2) as added reference to Gerard J. Brault's two volume book on the Rolls of Edward I.
4,Overall a pretty good book.,"I'd never thrown a baby shower before so I thought this book would help. It had some really good ideas in it, especially for games. The food ideas didn't sound too tempting and there was only 1 recipe for punch (I would of liked more). The game section was the best, so if you need game ideas this is the book. But if you need food ideas, I would suggest trying to find another book."
2,Best for a beginner,"The majority of the book and the best content was related to games. It did not go into too much detail of decorating or favors, which is where the seasoned shower planner needs some new ideas. It had a brief description on themes, but should have had recipes related to those themes. I was disappointed in the food section, not much content. I have never heard that a mother-to-be should arrive at the shower before her guests? Good for games, that's about it."
2,Overall a limited book.,"I was looking for something with an overall sense of throwing a shower. This book did not have everything I needed, lacking in food, budget, etc. If you are looking for something to give you ideas for every aspect of a shower, this is not the book for you."
2,"Thin on nice ideas, silly games.","I was anticipating this being a very good book based on some reviews, but was very disappointed and outdated. It does have silly games - something I wanted no part of at the shower I threw. I was looking for someone to take me through the shower step by step, but this bood did not do so. I would not recommend this book, especially if you are starting from ground zero."
4,Good performance albeit some warts,"1) The lopper cuts clean and effortlessly2) The plastic pull handle supplied digs too deeply into the pull cord and is a chore to disengage although the manufacturer describes it as a ""quick release"" handle, I got so fed up with it that I switched over to the wooden handle from my Sears Craftsman pole pruner to the Wolf-Garten and ditched the Wolf-Garten handle.3) One of the plated pivot bolts on the lopper started corroding badly within only a few months. I have been in constant contact with Wolf-Garten USA in trying to obtain a replacement and after several months am still awaiting the replacement bolt. They are quite frankly not very responsive and parts are as scarce as hens teeth."
2,Do not recommend,"The iron worked fine for a couple of weeks, it irons OK, is good weight. At the end of the 2nd week, then the plastic handle you are supposed to hold to retract the cord, broke. Without it, the cord is can not be retracted. One other issue I have with it is water spills - whenever you change the position of the iron from vertical to horizontal. If you prefer to keep your iron in horizontal position, make sure there is no water left in it."
2,Very Disappointed,Was very disppointed when I set up this Cd Player and found that the front panel display did not work at all. I even call the Coby Co. and they were unable to help and told me to send it back. I was hesitant to purchase a large item like this thru Amazon.com and now will be stuck with all the return fees.....never again
1,Technology has advanced too quickly for this...,"Unfortunatly, multimedia today is much more advanced to what it was when this CD was produced. It's got some nice bits and pieces, but technology can do so much more these days, that this CD set is reduced to being much to expensive for an old piece of software."
1,Disappointed,I must also say that I was disappointed with these pants. The material is very thin and gives the pants a cheap look. I am also worried about the quality of the stitching. I don't recommend these.(Review of Slinky Palazzo Pants with Chic Twist Waistband from Hot Fash Pants)
2,Way too small,"I measured my head and ordered this thinking it would fit nicely as I have a pretty small head and I was within the specifications here. Well, it was way too small, small enough for a child I would say."
4,"good helmet, good price","I chose this helmet for the price. It fits well and is easy to see out of. The back of the helmet allows for a ponytail to come out the back. I haven't had to put it to the test yet and hopefully won't, but so far it's working great."
4,Fits Great,"My head (measured around where my eyebrows are) is 21 inches. This helmet is too snug on the smallest setting but too big on the largest settings, so it fits me right in the mid-range. It looks pretty well made. It is not a top of the line helmet by any means but is a great buy for the price. I would not try to skimp on a helmet and I feel comfortable with the quality. Plus, it matches my bike."
5,"Light, Stylish and Comfy",I love this helmet. Its very light so you dont even notice it on your head. I love the feature in the back that allows you to tighten the straps around your head. I would reccomend this product to everyone.
2,Not true to size,"The helmet itself looks nice but the problem is the universal fit sizing is too small, so I had to returned the helmet :( I just placed another order of Giro helmet hopefully the second one will fit me right because I hate returning merchandise."
4,"Protecting your noggin! Great stylish helmet, little funky with the fit.","Love this bike helmet for its style and shape. The only thing that I found a little awkward was adjusting the straps, but then-- that's pretty common with bike helmets."
3,Universal fit-Misleading.,"Turned out to be too small and is not a ""universal fit."" If you have thick hair or a larger than average head then this might not be the right helmet for you."
1,"Very nice helmet, just too small.","Such a nice helmet, but too snug on my head. I think my head is just an average size (?), however, on the largest adjustment, it was too tight, so I had to return it."
4,Great,Very nice helmet. 1piece of advise is be aware that there are two different fit types. The universal women's fit is much smaller than just the universal fit. Other than that it is great.
2,tiny head helmut,"I have a small head (if i buy a fitted hat, i always buy a size small). So i thought it would be perfect for me when i was looking for a bicycle helmut. But when i got it, it was so small on my head!!! I couldn't keep it with such an inadequate fit, so i had to send it back. Perfect for pinheads ;)"
3,Universal Fit isn't universal,The helmet looked safe and pretty but it didn't fit. I had to return. My head isn't particularly big but it didn't fit well enough to be safe on me.
2,TOO SMALL,"I bought this helmet for someone as a gift, assuming universal fit would mean that it would fit a young adults head. I assumed wrong."
3,"looks good, lightweight, but weird fit","My head measures 21.75 inches, and at the largest setting the skyla did fit me. However, it did feel a bit too snug. Specifically, the front part was constricting my temples such that there was mild constant pressure which increased when I grit my teeth. Additionally, the helmet was too snug such that it sits too low on my head and prevents airflow. Thus, after wearing it for about 15-20mins, I had a slight headache and a sweaty head/forehead.I really wanted to like this helmet, since it is so sleek, compact and lightweight. Significant difference from my old one. Great value for the price! However, the fit was way too small. I ended up buying a universal fit Giro rift - which is very comfortable! The skyla is definitely for smaller heads than mine - it can even fit a toddler at the smallest setting (I tried it on my 15-month old and it fit him!)"
3,Snug but love the color and price,"I was Leary to buy a helmet on line with one size fits all sizing. I found this to be a little on the snug side but not so much that I'd bother returning it. I do have ""helmet head"" for a good 30 min. after wearing. I love the color and pattern. so nice to have something girlie without it being barbie pink! price was lower than anything i found in sports / bike stores."
2,WAY too small,"After months of searching for a purple helmet, I was so excited to see this lovely helmet with the gold flowers. It is truly pretty. Unfortunately, it is very, very small. It is more like a child's helmet. I fail to understand why companies think that women's heads are all one size - small. This is just poor business. I had to return it."
4,Wife Happy with new helmet,"After nagging my wife about not wearing her helmet while biking, she suggested a new helmet. She likes the color and design but mostly how it fits on her head without moving around. She has had some issues with adjusting the chin strap but is now wearing her helmet whenever she rides her bike. Mission accomplished."
5,Nice Fit; Nice Look,I found this at Amazon cheaper than any other store or internet site. I like the fit of these helmets. Just turn a wheel on the back and it feels like a custom fit. No messing with shortening straps.
3,second helmet,"I bought my first one about 2 years ago, and the piece that your head fits in broke recently. I liked it because it's super light. I wear on average 2-4 times a week. I'm not sure if this piece of plastic breaking has to do with me and how I ""treated it"" or what. It's actually very thin.What is the lifespan of these things? It'd be nice to know. I'm buying another one, but frankly I'd rather buy something with a little more quality and lifespan. If such things exist. I'm willing to pay more as well and just don't know if you get what you pay for or not. Inferior products are frustrating!"
2,"Love my old one, but","I have an older version of this helmet which fits perfect. I want a new one, but the designs are terrible. Why can't they make women's helmets in plain colors?"
2,A sweet and sour movie,"""Image of Bruce Lee"" [was bad] and ""Fist of Fear""[was bad] because the lack of story. The best partof four movies are ""Bruce Lee fights Back from theGrave"" is a classic movie. ""The man, The Myth"" is agood documentary if you don't know about Bruce Lee."
3,"Uh, hello?","Hey dudes! WHo is reviewing this thing! The dude who said these films deserve academy awards is on dope! ""Fist of Fear, Touch of Death"" is the worst bruce lee exploitation ever. It was made by Fred Williamson and his con artists at World Northal Films in the late 70's to pad their bank accounts. There were numerous lawsuits surrounding this turkey! Oh, Note to other reviewer: BRUCE LEE appears in none of these films, except for quick outtakes in that loser ""Fist of Fear..."". ""Bruce Lee The man the Myth"" is the only film worth watching, and yes, IT IS far superior to the Hollywood chick flick ""Dragon STory"". You can buy ""MAn the Myth"" seperately here at Amazon.com, so search for it and get it. The other two clunkers in this package are quite simply filmed road kill wrapped in a brightly colored package."
3,For Bruce Lee fans ONLY!!,"4 Movies for roughly 10$. Good price, good offer. Let's examine this further to see if its really worth it:GOOD:-The DVD offers 2 double-sided discs.-There ARE menus-There are a lot of extras among the 4 movies-There is a documentary includedBAD:-They spell ""Bruce Lee"" 3 different ways on the back of the DVD case (Bruce Li, Le, Lee)-2 of the movies aren't really that goodThis proves that this DVD is a nice addition to any Bruce Lee fans collection. I just wish they would include the orignal chinese versions also so I could hear Bruce Lee's traditional ""yelling"" that he is so famous for. The english dubbing isn't the best, but I can deal with it. I don't know if it will play on other's minds.To sum it up, if you are even the slightest Bruce Lee fan, then you should get this DVD set. Its one of the better bargains around."
2,Windsor : Stay plugged in!,"2 1/2This slow, repetitious, post-rock group got more acoustic and mellow on this album, though while aiming to be something akin to hypnotic and introspective, the band's lack of talent glares brighter here then on previous distortion-washed excursions. Embellishing cheaply written songs with cheap instrumentation, this is just the kind of album that gets under my nerves for it's lack of conveying the subtle depth it is attempting. Something about the acoustic, intimate songs are just sad..in a compositional way, not emotional. It was only on track 6 (thankfully following with 7) that my head finally shot up, awoken from it's apathetic stupor, to quickly and thankfully confirm why I sometimes appreciate this band- as a third rate mogwai knock off, with perhaps even greater pop chops...It is only in the beginning of that track that it's deep drums and subtle electric strumming make me realize this attempt was a misfire."
3,It's alright,"The unedited tracks from the show are annoying, but I usually counter that by just skipping over them. So that does help make this a descent album. The things that helped save this the most from becoming my next drink coasters would have to be the songs by Kelly and Ozzy. Kelly did a rather impressive cover of Madonna's ""Papa Don't Preach"", she has some real talent. ""Crazy Train""- Ozzy's most famous track and Ozzy says it best in the little booklet, ""what's a family album without this track""! ""Mama I'm Coming Home"" is arguably the best song on here while ""Dreamer"" also helped save the album from drink coaster status. It was the songs from the Kinks, Cars, and Starsailor that got this album from my view respectibility status. I wouldn't pay full price for this, but if you can...get it [inexpensively], what the [heck]?!"
5,Osbournes ROCK,"If you haven't heard this album you should. It's awesome! Jack put a song on the cd from a band that he signed called dillusion. They Kick [bottom]! Their cd isnt out yet so thats the only way to get a preview of dillusion's stuff. And beautiful kelly does a sweet cover of a madonna song. The CD is full of dialog from thier show. Even if you're not a fan, you will love this album. If you are a fan, this is a must have."
3,Has A Couple Winners,"The Osbourne Family Album is good mostly for the few novel ideas on here. Appropriate tracks for the Osbourne TV Show are included (Paranoid, Imagine, and You Really Got Me and Wonderful Tonight all are top tracks) but there is so much filler it almost makes this an unbearable effort of crass marketing. The Pat Boon Theme? System of a Down? I mean if those two tracks aren't a major clash, I will never know what is.As much as I appreciate Kelly for daring to be an anti-pop, rude to everyone she doesn't like and a self-appreciating girl, choosing a Madonna cover is questionable. Perhaps this is her ""I don't care what people think, I'm tough anyway"" thinking, but it doesn't really work for her.It is an interesting mix of the seventies and modern rockers trying too hard."
1,You are kidding me,"What in the name of all that is holy has happened to Ozzy Osbourne? The one time godfather of heavy metal and voice of the most legendary band in heavy metal is becoming nothing more than a trendy novelty, and this ""album"" is proof enough. Clips from the TV show are abundant, and are a bit funny, but they get grating and just plain annoying. Not to mention the music selection: ""Dreamer"", the severely overrated single from the mediocre ""Down to Earth"" is here, as is Ozzy's classic ""Crazy Train"" and Sabbath's ever more popular ""Paranoid"", but we've all heard them before, and they can't save this drink coaster in the making. Then, there is daughter Kelly's cover of ""Papa Don't Preach"", and I'll just keep to myself about what I think of that. It saddens me to see what Ozzy is becoming, I never thought I'd see the day that this would happen."
1,"Game Book, or snippets of bad fiction?","While the folks at White Wolf have always been a little guilty of playing hack-fiction-writer when they should have been writing a gaming book, the book of Worlds takes the cake. The artwork is mediocre as well. A large majority of the material therein is covered elsewhere better."
2,Overpriced Piece of Poorly designed Junk,"If you're looking for something that makes decent beer 1 or 2 times, then makes some great brown sugar, THIS IS FOR YOU. Otherwise, pass. Worked well the first couple of times I used it, now it doesn't hold pressure and makes syrup. Customer service is pretty weak as well. I think they KNOW they have a flawed product, but would rather not admit it. This thing is worth about $25. If you can get it for that, go for it, otherwise, don't waste your money"
1,Don't buy this product,"Got this as a gift and it's been a pain ever since, don't waste your time or money on it. This is an extremely poorly designed product. It comes in two pieces and no matter how well I was able to get the seal to fit, it still leaked. It took me four attempts and at least one failed batch to get the seal to the point that it would last the 10 days required to brew a batch. I would have been willing to put up with the leaking if the beer was any good but it isn't. The beer was bland and flat, despite me adding a significant amount of CO2 as the instructions said too. Anyone who is a fan of craft beer will not be happy with the results of this brew kit. If you're interested in brewing your own beer I suggest getting a worthwhile brew kit which actually allows you to actually brew beer, not just add water and wait. I should have returned this right away but wanted to give it a chance since it was a gift."
1,alot of time and effort for nothing,"I followed directions to the letter and both batches of beer went down the drain. Alot of time and effort for nothing. Don't waste your money,"
2,Please reconsider...,I would say if you are going to spend around a hundred dollars for a brew kit - then get the Cooper's set-up.Coopers DIY Beer Kit - OriginalYou'll be able to brew many batches of very good beer with equipment that wasn't designed by folks that should be making board games for children. In the dumpster it went. Junk.
3,"Kit OK, but Mix is a rip-off","Recieved as a Christmas gift. Put it together according to instructions and had no problems. Kit comes with 1 pouch of beer mix and it came out just fine. Here's my problem: You can only buy the mix from the manufacturer, and they charge $32.95 for a 3 pack (you can't buy them seperately - strike 1), and they charge $10.00 for shipping (strike 2!) . There is absolutely no reason whatsoever for them to charge $10.00 for shipping, other than to gouge you for a few extra bucks. And as far as I can tell you can't use another brand of beer mix in this machine - if someone knows otherwise please let me know as I refuse to purchase from the company."
5,Toilet training made easier!!!,"I know 3 children who were completely potty-trained for #1, but were having major difficulties with wanting to use the potty for #2. Two of the had been having daily #2 ""accidents"" for months. All three of these kids were absolutely fascinated with the picture of the little boy going poop. The drawing shows the boy from the rear sitting on the toliet and actually shows a small amount of poop going from the boy into the toliet. It was as tasteful as it could possibly be given the nature of this business. All three kids just stared at this picture and within 48 hours of reading this book while sitting on the potty, all three were using the potty for #2. I honestly believe that this picture took away the mystery and fear associated with this very natural function. It gave them a visual cue that they certainly didn't have before this book. I cannot recommend this book enough if your child is having any difficulty pooping in the potty."
4,"Made me laugh, but nephew loves it!","I bought this book as a joke because I thought that it was really gross and kind of taboo. We usually don't read things to our kids about excrement. But why not? They have to learn about it some day! My 2 year old loves it and calls it the poopy book. Fun to read, and the illustrations will make you laugh! Everyone looks constipated!"
1,Left my child very confused...,"First of all, what's up with the apple on the cover of this book? My child now thinks that not just everyone, but everyTHING poops! I have explained to him at least 4 times now that no, apples do not poop, but he continues to tell his friends. The other day he saw a squirrel with an acorn, and he asked me if the acorn was tree poop. This book, while sort of funny, is obviously misleading. The illustrations also portray pooping to be a very jolly event, and my child, who I was trying to potty train at the time that I read him this book, think's it's very cute to poop in his pants, and everywhere else for that matter. I do not recommend this book to any parents trying to teach their child about potty training."
3,Everyone poops okay...but,"This is a cute book if you want your child to understand that every living thing must poop. It shows you the animals how they poop and where they poop compared to people, but that is the extent of it.It doesn't do much for the potty training process, because it doesn't introduce how a child goes from diapers to a toilet or how you use the potty. The book's focus is limited to just the idea that poop is normal. Depending on your needs that can be useful or not."
2,ugh!,"This book was... interesting. We by no means are ""prude"" in our house, everything is discussed and by the time we bought this book, we were up for anything to get our little man to poop in the big boy potty. Everyone poops was amusing in that it showed the many different ways animals poop, but we found it to be a bit too graphic, especially the few pages that showed how everyone eats, too. Example: the lion tearing apart what looks like a deer leg. I haven't even read this book to him yet, because though I am ready to explain pooping and even about his new little sister about to come into our house, I am not ready to explain in graphic details the food chain (we do not moo when we eat hamburgers in our house, either). This book would be better if you are potty training an older toddler, that understands concepts like this, our little guy was only about 2 & 1/2 when we started (and is done now, thank goodness)."
5,Must have. Gets the point across.,"Great book. Shows how different animals and humans poop. Not 'graphic' (it's illustrated), but does show different animals and different shaped and sized poop (i.e. ""elephants make big poops and a mouse makes a small poop"")and even a dad and a toddler boy on the potty, but that's also how the kids learn, by watching us and their siblings on the potty. Love the end ..it says something like everyone eats so everyone poops. It really is just that simple. One of my favorite potty books so far."
5,Perfect for toilet training.,"Absolutely perfect for explaining to your toilet training child that everyone does in deed poop. This book is in my guest bathroom and everyone loves reading it. This and the ""Gas we Pass."" It's a subject you just wouldn't think would be in someone's bathroom, but why not!"
3,Too Crass,"Although the subject matter is what it is, I found this book to be too crass. You'd never catch Jackie O reading this to Little John-John."
1,One of the worst children's books I have ever read,"This book is completely ridiculous. It will not teach your child anything useful about potty training. The only point that makes is that since people and animals eat, they then poop. What a waste of ink and paper! My two year old daughter understood this point before coming across this book. I would never have purchased this book on my own-- it was unfortunately given to us as a gift. The pictures are downright creepy. My daughter became visibly uncomfortable when looking at the picture of the baby pooping in his diapers. It is not clear whether the baby is crying, happy or in distress. The people and animals in this book are portrayed in a manner which suggests that they are utterly lacking in dignity. If I were a small child learning to use the potty I would feel discouraged and embarrassed after looking at this book."
1,Not Very Good,This book is kind of gross not exactly what I expected and not really good for potty training which is what I had bought it for. My 22 month old son doesn't even give it a second glance with it's kind of dull picture's. I wouldn't have bought it at a bookstore if I had seen it first and it was kind of expensive. I guess you can explain how a body work's without all the graphics.
1,Images are Offensive,"I thought based on the description and reviews that this would be a fun book to share with the kids. But when I started looking at it I found the pictures to be very offensive. There is a picture of anatomically correct baby in a totally gross position that I was a little shocked by....and another picture of a man sitting on the toilet smoking a pipe. I found both to be totally offensive. I was so grossed out I couldn't even look at the animal pictures, I just put the book back in the envelope. Amazon was great about giving me a refund, so now I think I'll put the book in the recycling bin."
3,educational & amusing--gets old quick,"I bought this book for my daughter & I have to admit, for the amusement of myself & my husband. In deed, everybody/thing in the book poops. But, after the initial 13 year-old mentality we all still have hidden (some better than others) somewhere in our adult selves, the amusement wears off. Just like the we grow old, so does laughing at a deer or bunny pooping.I can't say that my daughter really gives a ... about animals & people pooping all that much either. Overall, it's not too ...of a book, especially for preteens or perhaps some of the elderly and others who obsess about bowel movements."
4,Everyone Poops,This is a great book for kids who are going through the stage of not wanting to poop in the toilet. Although we still have a ways to go with my grandson he does like the book.He thinks it's fun and in time will help with this little hiccup he is going through. It's worth a try!
5,Great book for potty training!,I bought this book for my daughter who has been having pooping issues. She loves reading it and loves seeing all the animals poo. It is a wonderful book.
1,HUH????????????,"I read this book at a library one time and it just doesn't make sense!! It talkks about all kinds of animals pooping and my baby brother (age 2 1/2) says that the book is quote ""gross"". When i showed it to my mother, she dissaproved of the book. I mean, maybe it teaches kids something, but then they go around talking about it in public, which is not very appropriate. If you agree with me, I think you are very smart and intellegent. I'm sorry if you didn't like this review, but this is what's on MY mind and I don't belive this book is appropiate for young children. Thank You for your time."
1,everyone poops,"this is a disgusting book, this is a disgrase to the little children.we all know it you don`t have to show that, i see it every day!!!!! I had nightmares after reading this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS BOOK IS SO DISCUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IM SORY IT MIGHT JUST BE ME BUT I DONT THINK THEY SHOULD PUT A BOOK OUT LIKE THAT I DONT RECCOMEND
5,"Cute, funny and enlightening for any young child!",This has got to be one of my grandson's favorite books! It's written in matter-of-fact style and imparts information in a straight-forward way without being distasteful. A fun read for any parent or grandparent to share with their little one.
4,not bad put pictures could be better,"the story is simple, my daughter loves to see the animals associated in the book but the pictures dont do justice"
3,Son Enjoyed Reading It...,"My 2.5 year old son enjoyed reading it because it was the new book to read (he loves books), but it didn't help much with the potty training in my opinion. And some of the lines just don't make sense or follow through: ""what does whale poop look like?"" Ok, but there's no corresponding picture or answer and, of course, my son wanted to know! :) And the little boy in the story is drawn anatomically correct, in case you wanted to know."
4,Great teaching tool!,"Not only is this book good for toddlers being potty-trained, I think it would be a great tool for big brother or big sister when the first messy diaper from the new baby comes along!"
5,Great Aid for Potty Training,"This is not a book teaching your child how to poop in the potty (that's our job, as parents!). But, it does make the topic of poop more accessible, less 'taboo'. My daughter loves it. We were having some issues where she wouldn't poop on the potty. A friend of mine recommended a few things, including this book. Started reading it every night before bed, and now, a few months later, we haven't had a single poop accident. (hope I didn't just jinx it)It's got great pictures of random animals. And, it also works as a counting book, because for some reason, my daughter loves to count the animal's butts. I also like how the baby poops in the diaper, but the little boy and the man poop in the potty. It just demonstrates how diapers are just for babies.This has been a HUGE help to us. Again, it's not a How-To book, but just another way to normalize a bodily function."
4,A fun facilitation of body consciousness and comfort,"I have seen some reviewers' discontent with this book's lack of explanation/purpose/facts. Let me begin by saying that this book is ideal for toddlers, when too many words can be overwhelming. :) I don't think the purpose of this book is to describe in detail the workings of the digestive tract. On the contrary, it appears to me that its purpose is to create a safe, fun, inquisitive environment for children to consider the functions of their own body, and to realize that many animals (including humans) are united by those very functions.With that said, I loved the lighthearted, unifying attitude of this book and highly recommend it to anyone working with young children and wanting to encourage body consciousness in them."
1,This is sick,"First of all, I have kids ranging from 18 years to 3-months-old. I don't think ""poop"" needs to be taboo or any of that other crap people are claiming of people who hate this book. My kids refer to it when using the potty. But that's the only appropriate time to use these words, and when my kids use them otherwise, they are using them as gross words with ""farthead"" and such.This book is really demonstrative to children. They hear this and they think it's fine to talk about it anytime. Soon they want you to read it more. They bring the book out, it becomes their favorite book. Pretty soon poop is a fun words and they use it in public. Sure, I may not care that ""everybody poops"" when my child says it, but the other 10 people in line at the grocery store might.Ecpilict pictures, foul language, yeah this book is a real winner. You should know that by all the joke reviews it got and all the teenage+ children reading it."
1,"Ok, I got the point...","Yes, it is true that everybody poops, however I do not feel I nor any child needs a picture book on the subject. The drawings of people and animals mid-poop I found mildly disturbing. The book has nothing valuable to teach outside of the fact that every living thing has bowel movements. I think it is logical to assume that elepahants would have bigger uhm...excrement than a mouse and I don't need to know what colors/shapes/consistencies said excrement comes in."
1,Down it went!,"I bought this book, read it, and then flushed it down the toilet, where it belongs along with it's poop family members.."
1,poop stinks,I have read and heard this book one too many times. Someone I know (K) has this book in her office and loves reading it to us like were 2. If you want your kids to learn about poop talk to a plumber or have them look in the toiletthank you
1,"Should Be Banned By Decent People!,","This obnoxious subject, poop, not only denigrates human beings but teaches children that poop comes in all sizes and all colors. Most scientists would distinguish between say for example, horse poop and human poop but these cultural re-visionists would have us believe that all poop is equal!"
1,Ewww,"Honestly, if you're reading this book, you're in need of serious psychiatric help. This book should only be read by the most hard-core of poop fetishists, as it contains words that no self-respecting sailor would use. This is terrible. ""POOP"" STINKS"
1,Outrageously ridiculously IDIOTIC!!!,"This book is a silly presentation of a subject that should NOT BE BROUGHT UP IN PUBLIC!!!! I am disgusted by the fact that many of the people reviewing it actually think it's GOOD. Let me sum this up. You are saying that a book that glamorizes poop with illustrations of people and animals pooping, and says obvious things that everyone knows(""Elephants make big poop, mice make little poop"") and other stuff. This is stupid! I am also offended by the fact that many people with a KID'S review had KIDS THEMSELVES!! WHAT IS THIS???!!! Okay okay, I'm not going to bite your head off. But honestly..."
1,Dumb little picture book of poop,A complete waste of ink and paper. Why this book was published defies logic.I can't believe all the donkeys who gave this thing a positive review.How the book ever sold a copy is a mystery.
5,fecal fascination!,"i bought this book for my little brother. hes 3, and LOVES talking about his runny bowel movements.. hes not old enough to know WHEN to talk about it. He had a habit of discussing his excrement at restaurants, at church, etc.. after we read him this book, he still liked to talk about fecal matter, but now he knows when to stop."
2,Over rated,"I'd go with any other potty training book before this one. All it taught my son was that it's ""okay"" (which it is NOT) to say POOP all the time."
4,Not everyone,"Though the book cover would lead you to believe otherwise, apples do not poop. Neither does my friend Matt, but I guess you can't expect children's books to take into account unlikely medical conditions. Otherwise, it's a pretty good book."
3,book is ok but not top quality,"I bought this book for my almost 2 year old daughter for Christmas. I'm only disappointed that the book they sent me had air bubbles all over the cover. Of course my daughter doesn't care, but its the second time that I've received merchandise from Amazon that was not top quality. The other time was a book where the first page was torn."
5,Love this book!,"Very humerous and fun to read, especially if you are potty training! Two thumbs up! Its also funny to watch the grandparents read it to the grandkids. ;o)"
4,Daughter enjoyed this!,"My daughter (now 19-months) really enjoys this book. She asked for it every night for about 2 months straight when we first started reading it to her at about 14-months. About a week after we started reading it with her, she actually showed a little bit of interest in the potty! (She's still not trained, although we're not actively trying right now), but I have to say, it is a great introduction to the idea of the potty and poopy."
3,"Funny, weird, not for everyone","I ordered this book thinking it would be a good way to approach potty training with my 2 year old daughter. She loves this book. I'm not 100% fond of it. It's a little disgusting. But, she likes it, it started us discussing using the potty, so mission accomplished.***There are several drawings of animals and people with poop coming out of their butts. This may not be for you.***We've already got the book in our bedtime rotation, but I guess I would have preferred to have just boughtPotty (Leslie Patricelli board books)which we also have and isn't as graphic."
2,A one-timer funny picture book,"This book probably has 15 sentences and 15 pages. Each sentence saying that this or that poops.The first time you read it (I should say SEE it) you'll really laugh no matter how mature you are. But after, it'll be left under a bed. Good as a joke present, especially for those low budget exchange gifts. Now isn't poop talking fun !"
3,Enough with the pictures,"Overall I think the book is great. Young children may be curious and rather intrigued by the idea of poop. The books clearly makes the ideas and principles known, but in my opinion a little to explicit for young children. Does the young viewer really need to see someone or something pooping in each page? I think one page would be enough for the child to get the principle. A child knows what poop is when they see it in their diaper or toilet, they do not need the graphic pictures."
4,Expected More,"While my daughter enjoys me reading this book to her, I wondered why it is talked about so much between parents. Maybe because it is kind of funny that it shows the different animals pooping. Never the less I ordered it to try and help with potty training and her with-holding pooping on the toilet. I'm not quite sure if it did help, but she does like it. She does poop on the potty now, but that was mostly through bribing her with fruit snacks."
4,Good practice for parents to talk to kids about stuff...,"I grew up with this book.It was never a funny book but rather a serious one. I liked it that way.My parents were never afraid of the subject of poops, and why should we be? This book is to remind people of the very natural and obvious fact about our body that people tend to ignore.Unfortunately, this book is not for everyone. This book is only for those who are honest and open.This is a good book for parents to practice talking about facts about our body. If you couldn't do this book, you will fail to provide sex and drug education to your children also. If you believe that you can skip and ignore those subjects raising your kids, you may skip this book as well."
5,Good Book!,This book is much talked about in many circles. It has caused a big stink (no pun intended) with some prudish adults. I think its great and get many compliments when I leave it sitting in the guest bathroom. Kids love it. They think about things like this. Why not address all of lifes touchy issues in this manner.
3,"All I heard was ""Ewww""","I bought this because my 3 year old daughter will not go poop on the potty. When I read this to her, the whole time she just kept saying ""ewwww"". I had hoped she'd get used to it after reading it a few more times but she kept saying ""eww"" and ""I don't like this book"". Just something you should consider before purchasing."
5,ITS POOPTASTIC!!!!!!!!,"I recently purchased this book for my 3 year 2 month 7 day 14 min. and 13 sec. old son. He used to call his poop sh*t. Thanks to this great book about crap, he no longer feels the need to refer to his waste as sh*t!!! He now says ""mommy, mommy, I just took a big POOP in the bathtub!!!"" Thanks alot ""Everyone Poops!"""
2,missing pages,Exciting to get this book for my daughter who is ready to potty train and this book was missing some pages. UGH!
5,Poops Galore!,"This book is great! Since it makes me feel like pooping, I keep it in my bathroom for when I get constipated. To bad it doesn't have a scratch-and-sniff page."
3,I don't get it.,"I can't understand why this book is so popular, but I didn't understand Dr Suess either. It hasn't helped my grandson yet, but a little friend of his laughed so hard she almost had an accident herself."
4,"Yes, but...","This is a handy book for preschoolers , I'm sure (I got it from a perverted friend at age 15), but I did feel the author was a little gratuitous with the fecal illustrations, even if only for instructional purposes. Whatever turns you on, I guess..."
4,"Hilarious for Grown-ups, Too","My husband and I first spotted this book in a friend's guest bathroom, perched on the top of the toilet tank. Charming and hilarious, it has been a quotable source of chuckles ever since. You don't need to have kids in potty training to have a good laugh at this adorable book."
5,"It's funny, educational, and all ages: a CLASSIC!","This book is helpful to parents, hilarious to children, and is illustrated well. I love it!"
3,"not really a potty training book, but cute/funny, and potty related, so somewhat helpful.","Obviously not a ""training"" book, per se, but I had to have it. I mean, hilarious. And all the animals are making a squinty face because they're pooping. My 17 month old may not totally get this one, but he's interested and likes it and brings it to me to read, and I get a kick out of it, and that's all that matters sometimes right?"
5,Hilarious Xmas Gift,Showed up quickly and made a great christmas present for my co-worker. He couldn't stop laughing. His kids loved it as well.
3,The Switch...,"Trino Olivares is a latino boy who has decisions to make... Should he be one of the tough guys in the neighborhood like Rosca or should he be one of the ""School Types"" like the pretty Lisana? To complicate matters Trino is living with his mother and three brothers who are just barely scraping by. The coming of manhood and the decisions one makes is a very important theme in many stories. Diane Gonzales Bertrand does a good job of mixing this theme with elements of the Latino American heritage mixed in. For a rainy afternoon or evening read Trino's Choice is not a bad choice at all..."
1,Disgusting...,"I don't know what the other reviewers were drinking or what alcohol they added to the cocoa, but this is the most disgusting tasting stuff I've ever had. I was expecting it to be spiced with cinnamon or something remotely appetizing but it tasted as if a band-aid had been fermenting in there, even the smell was gross. Wish I could give it less than 1 star and be able to return it."
1,how sad,this is not the original album. many songs overlooked then are sought after today and they just aren't on this dumpster collection...how sad
4,Smokey does it again!!,"I was surprised to see that this album was rated at just 2 stars. I found this compilation to be one of the best. Smokey teased us with OOh Baby Baby, and Tears Of A Clown only to finish us off with A Fork In The Road. I love this rendition and the way that Smokeys' voice is just a little different from the way that it sounds in some of his other albums. I give this two thumbs up without a doubt!"
2,Billy Griffin cover,"This is another Motown compilation of old Miracles' tunes from the 60's and early 70's...This small record label needed to include the monster hit ""Love Machine"" sung by Billy Griffin to sell it. It even sports a CBS Miracles' graphic featuring Billy Griffin on the cover... but 95% of the songs on the CD are from the old Motown group with Smokey Robinson."
2,Better Luck next time!,"I purchased this wig on 1/24/2010 for my husbands 50th birthday party. The party was held on 30 Jan 2010. I just received the wig on 1 February 2010. Also, I was a little disapointed in the way the wig look. The hair in the pic is a little darker and longer on the website. I had to purchase another wig on the day of the event. I was so hoping it would arrive in time. The show had to go on! I'm not quite sure what I am going to do with the wig now that I finally got it.Adult Tina Turner Style Wig"
3,Dates of some reviews?!?,Seems like this book was published on May 2000. How were some of these reviews made before that date?...
5,Masterful,"Dr. Block's commentary on Judges and Ruth provides the scholar, preacher, and lay student of the Bible with an informative, well-organized, insightful treatment of those books. I've done a bit of looking around for a good commentary on Judges, and so far, this one is the best."
3,Let the buyer beware,"I have been waiting for this set for some time. I believe it is out of ptint but Amazon says thay have it, so I ordered. It arrived in suprising condition. The box was open and had scratches. The CD's seem to be OK. As far as the performances are concered they are good but there are better, modern versions. The sound is just fair and Mravinsky's conducting is good but not exceptional. This is for collectors only."
3,"Not integrated as advertised, bad companion","Movie Studio claims to have integrated DVD burning. However, this is accomplished through the companion software MyDVD. As can be seen from reviews on MyDVD, the program has a lot of bugs, and crashes. It even crashes upon opening the folder in which MPEG-2 created by Movie Studio resides.If Sony wants to package Movie Studio together with MyDVD, they should make sure that creations from Movie Studio can be compiled into DVD's by MyDVD. If it weren't for this problem, I would have rated Movie Studio much higher."
4,Great video editor,"The main part of this package is what used to be titled Video Factory 2.0 from Sonic Forge (a company which Sony just bought). That was (and is) a great video editor. The main additional feature to this product is the addition of Sonic's MyDVD package to author DVD's. The video editor has some great features, and is very versitile. It includes tools to enhance the audio tracks, which is very handy."
2,Frustrating,"I wish I had not purchased this software. It has many flaws. One, if you have several pictures on your timeline and wish to extend or shorten the play time of that particular picture, you have to edit ALL the pictures after it. Not much fun when you have 50 pictures up there! Pinacle automatically moves surrounding pictures, much easier!"
1,Its de same software as Video Explosion Deluxe,"Dont buy this software, belive me,its the same as Video Explosion Deluxe but with a new name,its incredible that a Brand like Sony had approve this kind of trick,"
3,Covers the basics,"I tried the demo of Pinnacle before settling on Screenblast. Screenblast is much more stable and easy to do the basics. Although Pinnicle seemed to have a few features that Screenblast did not have, most of them are really not important. (For example, Pinnacle can do storyboarding, were Screenblast can not.)The biggest plus that I saw (besides the fact that it does not crash every 5 minutes like Pinnacle) was the Pan and crop feature. This allows you to pan/crop a shot. This is great for adding 'animation' to your still photos, as well as other effects for video.The biggest draw back is clearly the DVD creation. My Studio 4.5 is included and is a very weak software. The two are not integrated, so if you want to creat a DVD with multiple chapters, you have to go back through the camera. It is very disappointing.Overall, this is a decent product compared to its peers, but still has a few holes."
5,fascinating letters and a indispensible reference,"Not only are these letters to Harriet Monroe, William Carlos Williams, Allen Tate, Donald Hall, Robert Frost (and many others) fascinating and entertaining, but the comprehensive index makes it possible to find Stevens' own comments about and explanations of individual poems--for instance, his favorite poem was ""The Emperor of Ice Cream""--and details about the circumstances in which they were composed. Not only does Stevens outline his evolving theory of poetry, he also expresses his opinions about contemporary art, music and more.Readers that enjoy literary correspondence should also see One Art (the letters of Elizabeth Bishop)."
5,Very Fun,I really enjoyed watching this film and I've never even seen Annie Hall before. The script is clever and the timing is great. :) Great for a movie night with friends.
1,Avoid this crappy Synergy Archive Series DVD-R,"While I'd give the film something like a 7 out of 10 (For Y'ur Height Only warranting at least an 8.5), I really wouldn't have bothered buying this had I known that it is a DVD-R. I don't know about the quality of the other individual release of The Impossible Kid from Reel Classic Films, but it IS on a pressed DVD in a Martial Arts 50 Pack from Mill Creek, so I might end up shelling out for that... But not for anything else from Synergy Entertainment."
4,overall satisfactory ... a tad thin,"If you expect a smooth well knit stuffy scarf you might be in for a little disappointment. the scarf is ""smooth"" enough to qualify as ""lambswool"" material but it is not high quality of this dignified supersmooth wool. Besides, it is slightly thin for my taste and not fully commensurate w/ its price. From a distance, the scarf looks clean ... and after usage, you'll get used to it (albeit its +/- scratchiness). I wish it were less pricey."
5,Works fine,I can't complain about this filter material. It is what I wanted and expected and it does the job well. Much cheaper than the other Kaztly versions. :)
4,Plenty,Decent carbon filtering. Enough to last ne for years to come. Glad I made the purchase. Not sure why I have to write so many words???
5,GREAT !,"These are of the highest build quality i have seen and are pretty cheap for the three of them. Bought to use on my TV, LCD, iPhone works great for em all with no solution or water just a couple dry wipes and all the grease and dirt on the screen is gone, not to mention the company ships fast, I ordered microfibers from 3 companies on amazon this one was in a day before the estimated date of arrival and the other 2 aren't here yet. Great buy, might purchase again."
2,More coarse than expected,I got this for my guitar and found the fiber to be more coarse than expected. I would not use on anything with a delicate surface as you may end up with swirls.
2,Too Easy,"The kit comes with the ball and 3 dvds. The instructor is fine, but all the workouts seem to be geared to beginners. I am not sure why all the DVDs are the same level - would have been better to include a more advanced workout as well. I did not break a sweat.The stability ball itself is fun. I bought the Quick Fix stability ball workout DVD as well - that is is a much better workout."
1,SCAM,"I thought I was getting core secrets for 9.99 + S&H.; I have gotten billed $51.56 and didn't know I had to ""decline"" a membership. They have already sent another one and if I don't have them postmarked in a few days, will have to eat the charges.I probably could've had more attention to detail, but do you think someone wants to pay $52 for a 30 minute video, when the first one was 9.99?Terrible customer service and do not reccomend this company."
3,First videos are too easy,"I bought this ball a few years ago. I used it a couple of times then because I felt no results with the original videos (Fundamentals and Give me 20), but eventually put it away. I pulled it out again a month or two ago and tried with the instructional videos. Again, neither one gave me a burn. The ball is great, and it's easy to use. I'm just looking for a better video that challenges me. I don't know how the other videos are because I can't spend $20+ per video."
1,"Too BAD , Never buy",Never buy this Item from AMAZON .... So far replaced it twice and they still sending me the used one ... no wonder their price is lower because they are all used ....
5,Kickass PCI Express,This card kicks a lot of ass. Like a lot people at the PlanetDoom forums say:Vertex BurningWatercooledAND has extensive clothing shader 3.0 SupportDoesn't require a huge power supply.And it conviently fits well in my closet!Bottom Line: This card KICKASS! Specially with Doom 3 -wink-USCM-Cid
4,Good deal,Street fighter is a classic film. The sequel is also damn good. The bodyguard is quite entertaining. The ony thing i don't get is why legend of eight samurai is included in his gratest hits? Chiba is not the star of this film. Good deal for the money.
2,No support,"The program has the right idea and is very easy to use. However, I have issues. If I tune the guiter with the program tuner, I am able to play along with some of the songs. Many of the songs are played in a different key making it difficult to play along with. I contacted the Tech Support and they have offered no assistance. Only saying that they have never had this problem before. The program (if worked correctly) would be awsome. Because of a lack of Tech Support, I have to give it a poor rating and not recommend the purchase."
5,I'll keep it under my hat.,"Cowboy Sam is the local secret keeper in Dry Gulch. When someone tells him a secret he always nods and says, ""I'll keep it under my hat."" The problem begins when Cowboy Sam's hat gets too full of secrets! Nothing he does will keep his hat on his head and the entire town of Dry Gulch has to worry about their secrets! Ultimately, Cowboy Sam finds a solution to his secret problem, a solution which wins over everyone in Dry Gulch, even Tight-Lipped Tess. From now on, Cowboy Sam will 'keep it in his heart'.Our four year old loves this book and gets a real kick out of the cute Texas sayings that Cowboy Sam brings to the book. Yippity-Skippty and Yee-Haw! Illustrations are look good and are funny in their own right. Highly recommended for all small kids."
5,superb bedtime story,my son brought this book home from the school library and it was one of the best stories I've read to my children in a long time. I had to get my own copy!
2,A so-so earpiece,"Plantronics needs to lower the price on this item. It has no wind or gust protection, often giving a muffled audio to your calls. Plantronics offers much better ear pieces for much more of course. I upgraded to a much better headset with wind guard and it's worth it. Plantronics does stand by their products and I found even this headset to be sturdy, just not up to par for talking outdoors on the phone."
1,complaint,"Please do not order shoes on line, It looks beautiful in pictures but I am very disappointed when I received the order."
1,Bad sound quality/horrendous playback quality,"While the device is easy to use and set up (time etc), the sound quality, even in the highest mode (HQ) is horrendous. I used the device in a dead quiet room (no white noise etc in background) and the playback of any and all recordings is almost painful to the ears. There is some sort of screeching electrical noise which is made worse when you put headphones in as the electric resistance is actually audible. I am returning this device and warn you against purchasing this device. In all honesty the playback is worse than that of older microcassette recorders as the feedback and electric noises are less sharp on those and muted."
1,"BATTERIES, BATTERIES, BATTERIES","YOU WILL BE REPLACING THE BATTERIES AFTER EVERY USE, IT SEEMS.THEN, YOU MUST RESET ALL THE SETTINGS LIKE THE DATE, THE TIME, BEEP SOUND ON OR OFF,CONFERENCE OR DATA ETC..WHAT A PAIN. NOT TO MENTION, THE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE. AND GOOD LUCK FINDING ANY STORED DATA, OR TRYING TO ERASE FILES. IT'S NOT WORTH MY TIME. I'M RETURNING MINE FOR A REFUND."
3,anyone for a conspiracy?,"If you like conspiracies, this is the book for you. The author has used almost all of the biggest conspiracies of the 20th century to write this book (UFO's and crop circles are only two of them). But, as always, the mystery of Maria Magdalene is the main theme here.A lot of people might think that the author has tried to make easy money by writing another Mary Magdalene book, but 'The Magdalene cipher' was actually published before 'The Da Vinci code'.But this book isn't 'The Da Vinci code'. Although it is a fast read and funny at times, I was disappointed. The cardbord characters didn't help, but the worst of all was the 'big finale'. One of the most bizarre endings ever.A page turner with interesting ideas, but a horrible finale."
4,Much better than it should have been,"On the one hand, this is a typical by-the-numbers conspiracy thriller. On the other hand, it manages to avoid several of the more predicatable cliches of the genre, which makes it much more interesting than your typical book of this type. As an added plus, the author totally avoids the didactic overtones and overt lecturing that sank The Da Vinci Code in more than a few places. Throw in an ending that plays out on a more intimate, human scale, rather than focussing on bombast and explosions and you end up with quite an enjoyable read."
2,It Tries...,"The book's summary made me think the book had a lot of potential. Sadly, the story lacks any real, multi-dimensional characters. The main character is far too omniscient, even when he claims that he isn't (which actually makes the trait even more annoying than usual). And the main female character is so one-dimensional it hurts.The main plot had lots of opportunities to overcome the characterization issues, but fails by a long mark. The ending is, in my opinion, too 'Hollywood.' I had high hopes for this story, but it failed, in my opinion. Overall, I would not recommend this story."
2,Don't expect the DaVinci Code,"OK...I only listened to the DaVinci Code, but found myself sitting in my car not wanting to stop the story. This was far from a page turner, but did serve the purpose of a good beach book. I think it was actually about page 300 (of 400) before there was any real discussion of the Magdalene Society. Again, it was a good beach book, but perhaps there are better DaVinci Code-like books out there."
1,Um... is there a mistake?,"The synopsis of this title sounds extremely similiar to ""Kingdom Come"" by the same author. Was there a mixup?"
4,Works great but has some flaws,"This boombox is overal excellent. However it has some flaws.#1-Cant record AM broadcasts without interferenceI an record FM just fine, but every AM broadcast has a annoying hiss when I record. This is not good and I wish the problem be fixed in a future upgraded RCA model.#2-Digital volume control has to be on in order to recordWith analog radio tuner and volume control boomboxes I could dub a CD to tape without the volume blasting. With this boombox this cannot be done. The volume must always be blasting if one needs to record.#3- Tape deck does not auto switch to the next sideThis is annoying. But then again few boomboxes do this these days.Overall a great boombox if all you will use it for is CD/tape playing and listening/recording FM. Listening to AM broadcasts works great, but the recording is another matter."
2,Defective Remote,I purchased the RCA RCD152 for my 94 year old Father for Christmas and the remote was dead out of the box. After returning the unit the remote worked for three months and died. So now what do I do for a remote? I would not recommend this unit unless you don't care if the remote fails.
1,poorly designed,"Ive owned this radio for six months and im totally unhappy with the design. I dont like the push buttons for volume and other options. Sorry if i seem dopey but still have trouble figuring out how to select radio stations. A unit like this should be self explanatory and not need to read the book to learn how to use it. i only use it for playing cd's as i cant figure out the radio..yes, i know, just read the manual. im too stubborn. like i said, it should be self explanatory..whoever designed it was not on the ball and im not buying any other RCA products from here on in. now that im head of household i can make my own decisions and for thirty five dollars i feel jipped. im not a dummy either as i didnt take long to figure out my beautiful electronic fancy electric stove on my own..didnt use a manual for that..as long as you can read you can figure it out."
2,dissapointed,"I didn't like the way one selects the functions, one must press a button either 1,2,or 3 times to go to radio, cass. or CD function. The same for volume controls, press button up to increase vol. or press button down to lower volume.. I have seen and used much better setups in other boxes that I prefer a lot better."
2,lasts no longer than one year,"Actually, this is the third RCA boom box of this model that I have purchased because they are relatively inexpensive and my local Target carries them. The reason however that I have purchased three is that after one year either the tape deck or cd player fails. I use the boom box daily in a home daycare environment, but the children do not operate it. This past summer, I dutifully went out and purchased my third, but it has not even made it three months. The cd player fails to load and the tape deck unexpectedly clicks off after running only a few minutes. Number two boom box actually ate a cassette tape. The unit is attractive but it is simply too inconsistent to recommend. I'm looking for my receipt to take the last one back."
3,Settings Too Complicated,"I bought this for my mother, and had to get her a different one, because of the difficulty of use. In order to go to the CD mode, you had to push the ""on"" button 3 times. It was just too confusing for her. As far as quality of sound it was fine."
2,Not a good buy,1. The power cord can go in 2 ways and only works one way so took a while to get it started.2. I received NO REMOTE with my player3. The first few times I put in the CD it didn't work. The CD cartridge does not have a good fit.4. The CD player stops working sometimesThe only good thing about this unit is that it trays to make the buttons user friendly for any language and good for the blind but the buttons take to much effort to push which is annoying.
4,Perfectly adequate,"I was looking for a cheap boom box that would be loud enough to dance too without sucking down batteries at an alarming rate. This fit the bill perfectly. The sound is surprisingly good (as well as loud enough) for something so inexpensive. As a plus, it is nice and light too. It is obviously cheaply built - the buttons are loose, and the CD tray needs coaxing. But given it's price, it is a great little machine. And it does play CDs I burned without coaxing, which is more than I can say for my last CD player."
2,My Opinion,I am less than pleased with this product. The buttons on the player for operating the CD are stiff. The location of the cassette player on the top makes it awkward to insert a cassette.The remote operates well but it is poorly designed. It is shaped like a V with the narrow end toward the holder and it is slippery. I had to tape some waffle type foam to the back so that it would stop slipping out of my hands. Because it was so hard to clasp I dropped it at least 3 times and the battery door broke its tabs so I had to tape that shut.
2,Works for a short while,"After some months with what I thought was an excellent product, the CD playing started skipping, even doing so after extensive cleaning. It always seems to skip certain tracks and certain CDs even when they play perfectly in other systems.I don't know how the price got up to 139.99 (it was in the $50 range when I bought it) but it isn't worth that, not by a long shot."
1,Do not buy this product!,"Do not buy this product. It arrived today, and it does not work. It will not even turn on. I tried to call the company, but they are conveniently closed on Friday. I am sending it back. This was my first electronic purchase from Amazon, and I am not pleased."
3,CASSETTE PLAYER MALFUNCTION,"THE CASSETTE PLAYER DOES NOT WORK.IT PLAYS CD'S BUT NO CASSETTE AND WHEN I TRIED TO CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT THIS THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER,JUST A EMAIL CONTACT."
4,Soccer Instruction:Best Soccer DVDs I've Witnessed!,"Like a soccer drill bee hive, there are more than enoughdrills in this six DVD set. We have already seen more enthusiasmwhen we practice. Some of the drills are quite elementarybut for the most part, teams up to school age (15-17) willlove these."
4,Key Soccer Drills In Six Quality DVDs!,A litany of quality soccer drills in a well thought outset comprised of six DVDs. Each program has some outstandingsoccer drills and some that are average. My favorite program is34 SOCCER GOALIE DRILLS with CHAMPIONSHIP SOCCER DRILLS close behind.I was impressed with the video production values and the professional narratorused. Local soccer leagues as well as school coaches should take notice ofthese DVDs. For new soccer coaches this should be a required purchase.This is a value that I found well worth the money.Baseball Coaching: Schupak's Baseball Super 8 DVD SetThis baseball DVD set popular with Little League coaches is also produced by Marty Schupak.
5,Could It Be Autism?: A Parent's Guide to First Signs and Next Steps,Nancy Wiseman has done an amazing job of taking ton of complicated information and making it easy to understand.My son was diagnosed with autism at age 3 even though my husband had suspicions when he was 21 months old. We lost more than a year of services until he was finally diagnosed. I wish this book would have been available in 1999 when I needed it. Could This Be Autism? will be a tremendous resource to both families and pediatricians. I recommend it highly!
3,A good place to start for a young child,"Could it be Autism? is the only book on Autism that I have found that has addressed the signs in the early years. It is a good place to start if you have concerns about your child, however if you still have concerns after reading the book then I would deffinatly look at more comprehensive books such as the OASIS guide. As someone says she left out a lot of other good options such as OT and the gf/cf diet. It is also seemed to be geared towards the lower functioning end of Autism and does almost nothing to address those children who are on the higher functioning end of Autism."
5,A Good and Needed Book on Autism,"Could It Be Autism should be read by anyone concerned with a child's development. The book deftly mixes the latest information on identifying autism with the author's own compelling narrative. Nancy Wiseman is both a parent sharing her story, discussing her choices, and a professional giving sound, unbiased advice. Reading her book is like listening to an informed, sympathetic friend."
3,average songs,"I listend to the cd twice.I enjoyed it,but the voices are the same on almost every song.There should be more lead voice changes,even though the lead man is good. It's a nice change to listen to with some nice worship songs,though the songs due tend to run into one another without much of a change (example tempo),particularily the first part of the cd.Overall the cd is an average production."
3,Primary Care Provider (Buppert) Review,"I find this book very informative, a little dry for everyday reading but useful for me in my NP classes."
3,Much needed,"In the late 1980's Charley Pride's hits started to dry up. So he switched to 16th avenue records to get a fresh approach. And to be honest, he went back to his country roots and away from the fat and sassy pop he had recorded for RCA in the 1980's.This collection features all of his charting songs for 16th avenue records, long since out of print. This restores his last top 10, Shouldn't it be Easier than This and the fantastic regional hit, I'm Gonna Love Her on The Radio to disc.The rest of the songs, though lesser known, are well done. His version of On The Other Hand is on par with Randy Travis. And that same steel guitar sound that was on ""Storms of Life"" is on these recordings.All the songs are original recordings and the booklet is very well done.I say grab this before this collection is out of print."
3,Book comparisons about Joseph Merricks,"Like others I purchased and read this book after reading the book by C. Sparks based on Joseph Merricks life. I also purchased ""The True Story of the Elephant Man"" by Howell and Ford. I found that to be a vastly superior book in detailing his true life and the ways of the London in that era. Montagu did not enlighten me with any new facts, and filled the rest of his pages with his thoughts."
4,Great Literary Achievement,I was truly mesmorized by the depth of compassion that Montagu expressed. It is pleasant to read an author that tackles society's real issues. Bravo again Ashley !!!
4,Katherine's Opinion of the Book,Katherine: I thought the book was good. I like how they say stuff like rumplistiltskin was the one who got the big bad wolf and stuff like that.I also like how it makes every thing funny .I like it when the Millers daughter puts Rumplistiltskin in a half nelson
3,drake's reveiw on the book,"DRAKE: This was a good book to show classics about a story.It shows that a greedy king goes too far to get gold. Mystery book or o.k. It seems to me that this story took time to make because, how to make a character the way he is. I RATE THIS STORY A 6-10."
5,Super loud,Used on pontoon boat and definitly catches your ears. I have had many Wolo horns and never a problem. I put my old set on my riding mower and that turned heads.
1,WARNING!!!,This is the second set of these piles of junk that I've ordered and each ended up doing exactly the same thing: the compressor works fine but the horns die within 6 months.Both sets were mounted properly and both sets did the same thing...BEWARE!
3,quality,"hi guys, i have received my WOLO Airmax 403 model and its good quality - heavy compressor but the trumpet is poor quality, the wired thing is as its mentioned in product as its plastic trumpet , which i cant see it like that , coz i found out the its rusty inside the both trumpets the pack was received opened from one of the corners which i think the reason behind the rust, it comes with relay and bolts , screws , and short length hoseOverall rate is 3/5 - good heavy quality of compressor - bad trumpet quality - short hose -will try to install it soon and give you the feedback about how it works"
1,Horn is fit for the pit,First air horn arrives.......pay to have air horn installed.....find out that the compressor was defective out of the box. Second air horn arrives.......pay to have it installed AGAIN.......6 months later the compressor dies.DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP
1,Need to rewire your car,I checked and this unit was suppose to fit in my car. Well it took me two hours to find the very well hidden existing horn. Once installed the new unit immediately blew the exisitng 10amp horn fuse. It should be noted that nowhere in the description or the instructions does it tell you how many amps it draws. You should have at least a 20amp line or expect it not to work. I will now have to rewire the circuit to 20 amps to make it work :(
1,Wolo 403 Max Chrome,"It came very quickly from the seller. Well packaged. I installed it per instructions on my 2006 Ford Ranger 4x4 exactly in same place as the old one. because I have a two wire system, the horn adapter was not used. The small trumpet works, the large one doesn't. It also blew a 15 AMP fuse upon just pressing the horn button. It definately has some issues. Wolo may be a top maker for this line, but the product seems to be made poorly or at the very least, prone to problems. Would I buy another one from this company.?? No, I would not. Your best bet is to go to a junkyard and purchase one, you would probably have better luck."
1,Same thing - different color,I liked this because of the Antimicrobial feature and hoped that improvements had been made in the way it drained. Water still accumulates in the the 2 corners and has to be wiped up every time it is used. I'm still looking for a drain board where the water runs to the middle and out into the sink. This is NOT it.
3,Rubbermaid Large Drainboard,"The drainboard functions as advertised but I have have one negative comment on it. The underside verticle ribs, while slanted nicely to drain the water off, are made of a very hard material which causes the drain board to slide all over the countertop when even touched slightly. Dishes have to be placed in the top dish drainer carefully otherwise the bottom drain board slides out of position to drain the dripped water into the sink. The very thin underside vertical ribs make it almost impossible to stick on some type of anti slide rubber buttons to aliviate this sliding problem."
1,Piece of junk at best,"I replaced a ten year old ""rubber"" Rubbermaid drain board with this new plastic replacement. Rubbermaid should be ashamed to put their name on this product. The water collects in the middle when the board is flat on the counter. It is so light weight as to not have any ""grip"" to the counter. The lip will not span even the smallest sink molding. I've retreived my old board from the trash, will repair the split in the edge with some crazy glue and put the new board in the trash. It has zero value in my humble opinion."
1,This is not the size advertised,"The listing specifies the small is 15.4"" x 14.4""It isn't. If you're measuring a space or a rack that will sit on top, bear in mind that it's only 14.4. x about 13""."
3,Drainboard,I liked the older flexible type of drainboard. This is very hard and doesn't clean off as well. The shipping was quite expensive.
2,Over Priced,"Save your money, this is the poorest made Rubbermaid product I have seen. If you really want one go to Lowes or Walmart, it's ALOT cheaper there."
2,"Easy to use, drains fine, black shows all water stains","My title pretty much explains it. I haven't had the draining issues of other reviewers, but my problem is that the black plastic shows all water stains. I didn't think our water was particularly hard, but when it evaporates the leftover minerals leave a white residue. Yuck. Otherwise, it works well and I will continue to use it, though cleaning it often."
1,awful,"The board slides around terribly-I really can't use it. Also the lip is small, so water can run out too easily on the closed side. It's plastic , not rubber. i will try to get my money back. If not I will throw it away. I wish I could find the old rubber style that I have used for 30 years. I will not trust rubbermaid again.Carmen"
5,disappointed,I had wanted the old fashioned kind of drain board but they no longer seem to be available so in that case I am satisfied to have this type.
1,difficult to work with,"I never received this item. After contacting the company they sent a replacement and I thought I was all set. I received another EMail later that I was going to be charged if I didn't return the first item. I Emailed the company again to explain that I never received it. They apologized and said they would take care of it. I received another EMail a few weeks later stating the same thing. Again, they said they would take care of it. A month later I get yet another EMail they have charged my credit card. How many times can I explain this? I didn't get it."
3,Made in China,"product is just as described. replacing an old one of the same model, not nearly as good of quality. old one is flexible rubber, new is hard plastic. Thank you rubbermaid for more low quality chinese junk. personally i would pay more for better quality"
4,Overseas delivery,"I find the service very good but each time, I have to ship the products to a friend's place in US and ask someone to bring it back to Hong Kong. Please consider providing shipping service to overseas at a low cost. It doesn't have to be shipped by courier company, can be shipped cheaply by air mail."
2,What a shame!,This is either a knock-off or Rubbermaid is yet another company whose products have gone into the third-world pooper.
2,Wish I'd heeded other reviews :-(,"This probably works great if you have an under mount sink. I have a drop in sink and the angle of the drain board is not steep enough for the water to drain. Also, I'm constantly getting water underneath of it, because it slides so easily around the countertop."
3,Nice board...,"Used one (almost) just like it for the last 5 years. The materials they used seem to be quality still. BUT this one has a little different lip stop position. The stop is closer to the board edge and doesn't allow the board to reach over the chrome sink trim as far as the old one did. (Or the lip is just narrower ..which ever way you want to see it) Lifted the drain stop up onto the trim to correct this problem. Then, had to put a 3/4"" board under the back edge of the drain board to make the thing drain properly. The old one had to be modified the same way. Still, I cannot find a board that looks or works any better to replace this one."
3,Rubbermaid drain board - anti microbial,"Becomes cloudy looking after wetting & cleaning!It can look like it is dirty when, in fact, it is clean!"
2,drainboard not for high-edged sink,"I searched a long time before trying this drainboard, in spite of reading other poor reviews. I have liked Rubbermaid products in the past and hoped this would fit my high-edged sink like my old one, which finally cracked after many years of use. The new one doesn't drain properly."
1,Don't buy this.,"And if you do, put something like a towel or rubber mat under it to keep it from sliding around. This drainer is hard plastic, not rubber. As such, it is slippery and likes to escape. It slides away from the sink, making a mess. It tries to slide off the counter, too. Pretty sure it's trying to get away and take the dish rack along for the ride. The weight of the dishes does not seem to deter its efforts to liberate itself.You've been warned."
2,Read the Reviews First!,It's all been said here correctly. Cheap plastic. Drains on the long side as opposed to what the picture indicates. If that's what you want order it but it's light and flimsy and won't work if you don't have a sink mounted under your counter top.
2,Looks great but too slippery,"This is very nice looking and slanted so the water runs off. It has one drawback, it is much too slippery on the counter top. Needs to have some rubber grips attached to the bottom. I cut a non-slip piece of material to fit the bottom. Works great now."
3,Read the specs,"When they say small, they mean SMAAALLLL. I haven't yet found one of my apartment-sized draining racks that this thing will fit. Oh, well, maybe I'll turn it over and use it as a cutting board."
2,drainboard,This drain board is like all others that I have found.By the picture I thought the drain was on the end.That is why I purchased this drain.The drain lip on this drain is on the side.My counter top would have to be two inches wider to use this drain.THANKS
1,Terrible drain board,It was stiff and unyielding. We ended up throwing it away and buying a new set at Costco. I was disappointed in it.
2,Not same quality as before,"This review is to the Rubbermaid Corporation and has nothing to do with the seller. I was very disappointed in this product. I have used Rubbermaid dish drain products for years and their quality has definitely slipped with this purchase. I will not use Rubbermaid again. The thickness compared to my prior purchase is very thin, the height of the drain board does not allow the water to drain properly back into the sink. I had to add a height bar under the drainer to get the water to drain properly. What has happened to quality control...it must be a thing of the past! I can tell this product will not last as long as my prior purchase, but I guess that what American Corporations now look for, dissatisfied customers who need to purchase products more often. Rubbermaid, you have lost a long-time customer."
2,"Slides to much , needs rubber pads",Bottom is hard and ridged so drain slides on counter top. Needs rubber feet or pads to hold it into place.
1,Don't Waste the money!,This thing is a useless absolute piece of crap! It doesn't even come close to draining water. Anyone desiring to start a mosquito farm or build their own rice paddy should buy one as it is great at promoting stagnant water! You are better off draining your dishes on your counter top with better results. Awkward and clumsy as well. Comes in handy as a king-sized doorstop or something for your dog to chew or piss on! Wasn't worth the energy it took to open the box it came in!
1,???,"Shopped yesterday for a drain board--NOTHING available except the ones that drain sideways! Lost a nice glass mug because of it. Thanks, Rubbermaid."
3,Review a sink mat?,"I hate doing reviews, but if I don't they keep sending me emails. It's okay, it does what it's supposed to."
3,Okay Drain Board,"This drain board was okay, but was a little too small for the metal dish rack I bought my mother."
1,Water Does Not Drain Over Sink Edge,"I've had this product in white for some time now. We've lived in homes with laminate countertops, so the sink has a bit of lip going over the countertop. The drainboard does not angle high enough, or sit high enough where the water should pour, for water to drain. We took measures into our own hands and cut the drain lip of the board off. This gets some water to drain out (if you make sure to pull it over the sink!) but it still pools in the corners. We've put a plastic block about 2 inches high under the rear of the drainer board (carefully balancing the rack and all dishes on top) and the water STILL doesn't drain out of the corners. Still looking for a reasonably priced drain board to go with reasonably priced countertops, as I doubt people with granite/no-sink-lip countertops even have these problems with it, at least not to this extent."
1,Drains everywhere but into the sink,"I certainly miss the former Rubbermaid. I say ""former"" because nothing I buy from them anymore works well.This drainboard is rigid and flimsy - and it doesn't have a ""lip"" long enough to extend over the slightly raised edge of my sink. The result is that the water drains everywhere but into the sink. The drainboard that I replaced it with was about 9 years old and worked exceptionally well.. but it had started to tear. I wonder if anyone could explain to me why a company builds a good brand over the years - and lets that brand go to pot."
3,Not worth the money for just 1 pc,"I saw this AND the whole dishwashing dryer set at Lowes for the same price! If u need this piece, just buy the whole set locally instead of buying just 1 piece."
2,Quite Disappointed....,"I have been a long-time Rubbermaid user.I have a Rubbermaid Drainer Tray that is 17 years old and I love it! I needed a second one for my apartment. What a disapointment in this new purchase! It is made of cheap hard plastic that slides around on the countertop (I have laminate countertops) as if it is sitting on a surface of glass. The older trays were rubberized and stayed in place.The height of the board along the edge that is supposed to drain water into the sink is too high, and again; the old trays did not have a height. They sat flush with the countertop.I resorted to using a sheet of slip-proof shelf-liner that one can buy on a roll in a kitchen-ware section to keep this Tray in place.I am quite disappointed in RubberMaid for changing their product. They used to be one company you could truly count on to give us our money's worth.Seems like with many companies these days; the bottom line is to give consumers a cheaper product, charge more money, and leave us with junk."
1,Review more on seller than item,"Picture shows drain board draing to narrow side. however, item received drains to the wide side. Even tried twice to get it right!"
1,Drainboard,"It does what it's supposed to do; however, I'm not happy with the drain on the long end. It doesn't fit my sink well and is uncomfortable as it does not allow for the ergonomic placing of the dishes which should be left to right not front to back."
2,Rubbermaid drain board,"Not happy with this item due to the way it sits up against sink edge. My sink is a ""drop-in"" white porcelain sink with a higher edge than your stainless steel sinks and this just does not sit well against it. The ""legs or support structure"" underneath this board are not high enough to sit properly at the sink edge so water draining from wet dishes runs onto my counter, then onto my floor. I had to rig it by placing something under it to help it sit higher so the water drains into my sink as it should, which makes it unstable when I load it full of dishes. They need to create one with higher supports underneath to accommodate the newer sinks."
2,Rubbermaid drain board,"It does not allow the water to drain into the sink, so it ends up on the kitchen counter."
4,Great product!,"I absolutely love this product & could only find it at Amazon & the price was right. Good, sturdy, black dish drainers are hard to find in stores"
1,I should have read the 1 Star Reviews before purchase,"Bummed to discover this $16 item drains sideways. This makes it SEEM to occupy more counter space than necessary. Considered sending it back, but thought, ""Why punish Amazon for my poor research."""
2,Doesn't Drain!,"Definitely not a good purchase. The drainer doesn't drain very well, if at all. Right now, I have the back propped up about an inch so the drainer actually drains. Otherwise, water just sits on it until you manually lift the back up to drain off the water. This is definitely not the same quality as a Rubbermaid drainer I purchased about 2-3 years ago. The plastic is much thinner and not very pliable. Als,o the country where it was manufactured (good ole USA) isn't where it is manufactured now (China). I'm debating on whether or not to return it with the dish drainer portion also. Buyer beware of this one! Shame on Rubbermaid for manufacturing an inferior product."
1,"Goodbye good rubber, hello crummy plastic","I tried this thing to replace my old RUBBER drain board, but this one is practically useless: slides around, tippy, too small, too hard, too light, wrong shape, and NOT RUBBER ANYMORE! It's just hard, crummy plastic. Whatever happened to the RUBBER part in Rubbermaid?I tried contacting the company repeatedly to ask why they stopped making the old, superior, RUBBER drain board - and to please bring it back - but they never responded. Maybe they're embarassed. Yeah, right.I found one of the good old ones at a garage sale. Take THAT, ""Rubbermaid."""
1,"Had it for a few months, it's already useless",I bought this and the rack it comes with from Walmart a few months ago. I agree with all of the other negative reviews that it collects water and has to be rinsed off every few days. However I just had a new problem that after having this for less than 6 months it's already got some sort of crack or hole in it and it's belting water out all over my floor every time I use it. I was actually on Amazon trying to find a replacement when I came upon it on here and decided to give a bad review. All I have to do is wash dishes for a few minutes and like clockwork my feet are soaked. Next time I'm going to spend more money and get something better.
2,Slides,"While expecting a ""rubbermade"" product, it turned out to be hard plastic that slides on the counter top. It also doedn't drain that well."
2,Insufficient,"This product is insufficient for the intended use. It is much lighter than the one it replaced and slides to easily on the counter. Material is more like a hard plastic than a softer heavier rubber, skid resistant like material made previously."
1,too small,"Although this drainboard advertises itself as ""large,"" it is in fact too small to fit the same brand ""large"" dish rack. Do not buy."
1,Needs to drain to sink from short end,Rubbermaid has always made great products. Why on Earth did they suddenly decide to design the large dish drainer trays to drain water off the long side? Most consumers sinks will not accommodate this design. :-( Hopefully Rubbermaid will listen to it's customers and go back to the old design that worked for years and you had many satisfied customers.
1,Garbage,"Nothing like what they used to be, even two years ago. Cheap, thin plastic, lip on the drain side now is only about and inch in so you have to move the whole board well into your sink area or it spills all over the counter - and that's with an undermount sink. This used to be a well-made product. No more. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,Works Great,I bought this with the matching dish drainer and it worked really well when we lived somewhere without a dishwasher. Thank god those days are over.
4,Great product,"This drainer slopes gently and guides the excess water into the sink if you do not have a draining board.My plate drainer fits snugly on top, and the black colour blends perfectly with my worktop.it is easy to clean and wipe down."
2,Small drain board,The description said rubberized. It's plastic. I was specifically looking for a rubberized mat. I could have bought this @ the local grocery store.
1,CHEAP AND WASTE OF MONEY,"The ONLY value to making this purchase is if you want a set of ""chisels"" to practice sharpening with. They are PURE GARBAGE. Not sharp. Not able to sharpen. Blade comes out of handle."
1,Almost laughable......,"I don't remember why I got these, but what I DO know, is that they can't cut through pine, (not without falling out of the handle), and definitely can't touch a hard wood like oak. I'd say I had success using them on a pumpkin around Halloween, but at the moment looking at them in the trash, I can't honestly say that they did that very well either......"
5,The Battle Belongs to the Lord: Overcoming Life's Struggles,"This has to be one of my favorite books by Joyce Meyer. It gives you practical strategies to overcome life's every day struggles by handing them over to the Lord. This book has so many realistic tools that can be used to live a life of victory through the Lord. I have to admit that when I read the Bible I sometimes have difficulty getting the true message or meaning that is being conveyed. Joyce has a remarkable ability to translate verses for people just like me, as well as give practical methods of putting these passages to use in every day life.READ THIS BOOK AND START YOUR LIFE OF VICTORY."
2,NaturVet Fast Bath,"This product doesn't work too well since it is basically a wet shampoo that sprays on--which means you still have to towel dry the dog and finish grooming like you would after a regular bath. I guess it saves some time, but I thought I was getting a dry spray-on shampoo product and was disappointed with this. It may be o.k. for short-haired dogs, but it doesn't work well for poodles and probably wouldn't work too well on long-haired breeds."
2,A competent rendition -- but BEWARE. A fatal flaw exists.,"Mostly well done, if a little too pared-down for my tastes. Other recordings have captured a more ""lush"" quality in the piece. If a quintessential Romantic-era work doesn't beg to be embellished, I don't know what would.By far the most aggrivating (and damning) aspect of this recording is a low, mysterious humming that follows the punctuation of the orchestra, clearly not produced by an instrument, and especially bad on ""No. 4 Final. Andantino."" Casual listeners may not notice or care, but I find it intolerable. I suspect it is either a player or the conductor himself, unaware of their dubious contribution.I find it hard to believe that the engineers working on a major label, professional quality work wouldn't notice this fatal flaw. Whatever the case, it is unacceptable and in the end renders this recording admirably intentioned but poorly executed."
1,Disappointing,"I cannot stand this recording! And I've tried so hard to like it ever since I purchased it over a year ago. As others have mentioned, it's a cold, hard-heartened, unemotional and uninvolving interpretation from Pletnev, and it is, frankly, boring. The best thing about it is the Arthur Rackham art-work used on the CD cover and inner booklet.As someone mentioned below, of especial annoyance, even if I had liked the performance, is the extraordinarily irritating 'humming' by Pletnev as he directs the orchestra. Perhaps if the performance was better it would not have been such an issue but it's really quite unbearable."
3,Thugz Diary,"This was a very good cd, but Pullin Rank was much better, and Kansas City Chief is his all time best!"
1,Not Much Here,"I am sorry to say that there is not much here but a very short collection of sayings and quotes (one per page). Not very deep and, for me, not helpful. I would recommend that you not waste your money and look at something from a more well known spiritualist."
1,worse i ever imagine,"This is a very bad quality dvd, the video and sound are not sincronizad. The control doesent work in a logic way. very bad. dont buy it"
1,Nice for the few days it will work.,Bought this player for a camp house we have on the lake. Took it there and it lasted 6 dvds and then quit recognizing them. Disc load error. Kept it too long to take back. Avoid Coby at all costs.
2,I would hold out for a better card.,If your a gamer or use photoshop and premiere a lot then I would upgrade to a better card. This graphic card is good for medium computing usage. It will run games but not at the high resolution range.
1,Buyer Beware,"Shame on me for not reading the fine print on this one. When I looked at the list of cuts included, it never occurred to me that I should scroll down past the 1st movement of Symphony No. 5 to make sure all the other movements were also listed. Imagine my suprise at first listen, when the 2nd movement turned out to be a minuet!This purchase was a huge disappointment."
4,Watch your friends...,"This story is about a serial killer and maybe another killer. Brett & Paige are Officers of one of the Law enforcement agencies tasked with dealing with this serial killer. They find themselves vicitims of this serial killer in a way you would not believe. The truth must prevail. There are plot - subplots and more subplots in this book. It is exciting, thrillings and keeps you guessing. One thing you will do after reading this book, is, re-evaluate who your real friends are ?"
5,WHEN FIRST WE DECEIVE,"THE SERVICE FROM AMAZON IS AMAZING ,WHENEVER I ORDER A ITEM IT COMES IN THE CONDITION IT SAYS IT IS IN,NEVER HAVE ANY TROUBLE RECEIVING OR RETURNING A ITEM...UNFORUNATELY I HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK YET,WILL PLACE A REVIEW WHEN I DO..."
2,2 stars for cuteness only,"Very cute pump...unless you look closely at the poor workmanship. Looks like they didn't have enough of the material they used as a ""liner"" on the sides of the shoes and tried to stretch it. Also, where the heel meets the shoe on one of mine, there's a piece of plastic in there I can't get out. This is the second try for these shoes because I had ordered a half-size too large on the first try, and apparently I didn't inspect those closely enough after realizing they were too big. The fit is still ""off."" They run WIDE. They are NOT even real leather. I can't believe Dereon/Beyonce would have her name on these AND sell them at this price! You'll find better quality shoes virtually ANYWHERE; try Target or Payless for a fraction of the price. If you want style similar to this, pay the same or a little more and buy Baby Phat brand. These are going back. I am unbelievably disappointed!"
5,An Awesome Read,"I came across this book purely by accident, as I researched sediment transport for a thesis. I found the content totally absorbing and regret that I will never get to meet the author, who's writing style and experiences marked him as a real human treasure. This is a book for all ages, with concise anecdotes that have you laughing and wondering. It is interesting to read about the involvement of New Zealand troops in the LRDP and Bagnold's determination for this group to succeed; ironic when you consider a Kiwi is generally known for his ingenuity and this group were led by one of the most ingenious men of all, an Englishman. I especially like the concept that discovery and research do not require either tertiary learning, or expensive lab equipment, just an enquiring and analytical mind and a good dose of common sense. Thank you Mr Bagnold, for sharing a part of your life with me, I am much the richer for it."
4,Good Price,Got this for my girlfriend's grandson. Arrived in time and was a good price. I have six more words required
3,Review of Turtles Box set 1,"Well, I love the extra of the DVD's, there is a 4 part interview with Peter Laid and the making of the Turtles but unfortunately, there is only 12 episodes of the season 1 on 26."
1,Does Not Come with the 4 figures as advertiesed.,The turtle DVD 1-4 box set is different than what is listed on the item listing. It does NOT come with the 4 turtles as advertised. Misleading listing and not worth the money or space. You can get the same episodes on the Season 1 part 1 DVD and all the episodes fit on 2 discs instead of 4. This was a waste of money and time.
5,it has revent itself,"This new version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles which was made in 2003 is better then the old school. Cartoon Network needs to pit it back on Miguzi. Their not so much obsess with pizza that much and the show looks a little darker, the fighing is better it's more anime style. They still have their sense of humer and own personalities. The shredder is an evil alien disguised in a armed body that looks like a human. The turtle found April Oneal who ues to work for Stockman until she found out he was making these little mechines call mousers like it's suppose to stop New Yorks rat problem but he is just insain."
1,What box set?,"Product came in paper envelopes. No individual cover, no box, no title, no nothing. This seller saved a lot on shipping. Without the covers, it's impossible to tell what the movies are about.For the money I paid for the items, I expected more, at least a way to identifiy them."
4,It's cool.,"Dudes and dudettes! this CD is cool. MTV and Dick Nigel did an excellent job on the movie and CD. The lyrics are a blast and ""smooth."" I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Nigel or someone sign these guys to a contract and do a follow up CD and overtake the boy bands."
3,Too Short...,"The movie was great. The CD is pretty good- it is what it is- a soundtrack to an hour and a half made for TV parody of boy bands. Of course, anyone who wants the CD probably knows that. But it's very short since not many of their songs were played in the movie. If you really liked the movie, as I did, you will no doubt appreciate it either way."
5,Best Boy Band,I think that they are very talented guys. Their music is cool and I love listen to it. I can't wait to buy their next cd.
1,Very Cleaver Take,Spinal Tap of Boy Bands.this is a Funny Mockery at those Lame Boy Bands.funny thing is so folks are taking it as the truth?they sound just Like the Bums they are Emulating.the same Weak New Jack Swing Beat that Played out a Decade ago.But Hey Cash In on it.All The Groups Sound Alike&MTV doesn't care.
1,IT'S A JOKE! IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A SERIOUS RELEASE!,"This recording is not meant to be serious effort to make money. The sheer fact this disc was realeased is revolting. Every track is the same rehash as the other boy groups(NOT BANDS) use. It's a drum beat and whining. Every track. Every single track. A basic eight beat track with some cliche lyrics. Ick. This is supposed to be laughed at and scorned, not appreciated for music and talent that doesn't even exist. The only credit I can give this garbage is that it's better than Backstreet (Who still suck.)."
5,I like all their CDs,"These guys are really talented. It's funny cuz I like ppl like Britney Spears and 2ge+her all the way up to Eminem! These guys need more attention out there in the world. They are so awesome and I love their music. I just recently got their newest CD, and I can't put it down!! I really hope 2ge+her starts getting ""more famous"" out in the world, because they are very talented, and for once there is a boy band with different varieties of ages and not just in their 20s. GO 2GE+HER!!! ~Your Biggest Fan~"
5,Q.T is sooo hot!,The cd rocks and the songs are so funny! The mtv movie was really cool too. The kareoke of rub was a total waste of space they could have at least put a 2gether song as kareoke. They also should have had more songs but the ones they had totally rocked! and i gave it 5 stars. All the guys are totally hot! especially Q.T.! aka Michael Cuccione. they are really great singers! If you liked the movie you will love the soundtrack
4,"Thanks, MTV!","I think this album is so cool and...funny! They're like the Meaty Cheesy Boys-which I find hilarious. Like Weird Al Yankovic and his thing for polkas and Star Wars, Jerry Springer, and Hackers, 2gether puts some humor into their music, and that's way cool with me. If you're in a bad mood, yeah, you like the way the true boy bands sound, but sometimes all that stuff about being lonely and having your heart torn up is just too heavy. So, put this C.D. in your stereo. You'll get the voices of boy band material, but the lyrics that can really pick you up."
5,Its Sad..but good,"Its sad that we had to really say goodbye to the just-turned 16 yr old member of together Jason ""QT"" Mcnight played by Jason C. Who really did pass away of lung failure this past January of 2001 just 8 days after his 16th bday. Now listening to this cd, especially ""Before we say goodbye"" does make you kinda sad. Its a great album nonetheless for a singing ""Boy Band"" who was actually intended to be a spoof on all the boy groups,and an MTV boyband music series but hey, they really did sing and did a heka great job doing it that all the girls really take it as real boy band music! Its great, and even is pretty funny!"
5,"2gether 4ever! Noah- ""U+ME=US""","OK for starters I would just like to say that the movie was extremely funny that I knew I had to go out and get the CD and I'm glad I did! Even though it isn't all that long Its a great CD! I love the song ""Before we Say Goodybye"" Secondly the songs are so funny and they always make me happy and laugh! I'm so glad I got this CD. Thirdly: I LOVE NOAH BASTIAN! HE IS JUST TO HOTT! Looking into His Big Beautiful Eyes makes me melt.(sigh) When I look at him I always start to sing ""2gether me and you 4ever"" or ""U+ME=US"". I LOVE NOAH! He is so talented and cute and (sigh) ok I need to calm down! Noah! You will always be the Michael in My heart! <~~had to have seen the movie to understand! The movie is so awsome & the movie is even better! I definatly recommend buying this CD! If that isn't convincing enough, then just look at those 5 fine guys on the cover of the CD!"
5,awesome!,"this is such an awesome and unique soundtrack! probably one of the best soundtracks out there. the movie was hilarious and the CD totally goes w/it's humour. even if you're not into the whole boy-band genre, you're gonna love this CD. with all it's hip, catchy tunes and cute, funny lyrics, it's one of those CD's that'll be on repeated play in your stereo for a long, long time."
5,Awesome!,"If you liked the movie 2gether, then you'll love the soundtrack! It is an excellent grouping of songs!"
2,I would like to respond to people who write serious reviews,"I can't help but laugh at the outrage of other people who challenge the production value and not so serious song titles of a CD that is clearly a joke. I guess that critics aren't allowed to have a sense of humor. Still, I can say it's not something I would listen to, but why challenge the types of titles on a CD when it is clearly not meant to be taken so seriously?"
4,Come on...It's fun and funny.,First of all you have to have a sense of humor to appreciate what the guys behind this CD are up to. They are poking fun at a phenomenon that has taken the music industry into the next decase. If you don't like it...don't listen.
3,Its good and Hilarious,I liked this CD and the show on MTV just because it was funny. I laughed through out the whole thing. The lyrics need help but other than that it was good. So get this CD its grrrreat!
4,Better than real boybands,"This CD is actually good. The guys can sing and they aren't bad looking either. Some of the songs are gross, but they are funny. I can agree, the CD should have been longer. If you like *N Sync and BSB, then you'll probably like 2Gether. Beware, teenyboppers under 12, the lyrics are a little too mature for them."
4,I miss Q.T.,"All I have to say is I love Q.T's solo (it's a really good song, so that's the best reason to get the album) and Q.T. or Michael Cuccione passed away January 13,2001. He was the best person in the group(and the cutest). So that's what I have to say; sorry for sounding so mushy if I did."
3,Not bad for the price.... read on...,"This is not a bad horn for the price. One thing that you will have to do is get a louder speaker ""horn"". I put it in my car, and it sounded not to bad, but people in front or you will probable barley notice the air horn. So I then hooked it up to my buddys 1999 Crown Vic, Police Package, with the real siren speaker and it was 4 time louder. So the box that makes the sound is great and sounds real it is just not loud enough. So if you do get this item, plan on also buying a new siren speaker for it. You can find real police speakers for this on ebay, or just go to your local radio shack and buy a louder, loud speaker."
4,Very nice,"This is a very nice horn. It is cheeper than buying it on the manufactures web site. The shipping was 6 day :). This horn will not work on your car unless you buy a BIGER SPEAKER. I am using it on my ATV/UTV and it is just right. Also the cables are short ONLY ABOUT A FOOT. you will need to buy longer cables. I had someone install it for me but it did not look that hard to do. They bought the extra cable but it was most likly $8-$17. If you are useing it on a car be carful as you could speed $80-120 on a speaker and up to 20 on cords. Plus installing it. Great for ATV/UTVS (lawn mowers, small trackers and anything like that)"
2,forget it,"I got put in jail for 30 days for having this on my bike, it's illegal in most states. Might be good for kids around the block for anyone who rides in the city, forget it."
4,happy,"We haven't hooked it up yet, but we like the look. My husband will be licensed volunteer fire fighter next month so he can't wait!"
3,WHAT A MESS,THIS IS SO LOUD AND DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE. WISH I COULD FIND A SIREN THAT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE CORD. BUT IT IS VERY LOUD
2,THIS HORN IS SOMEWHAT OK FOR A TOY.,"YES AS I SAID THIS HORN IS SOMEWHAT OK FOR A TOY. THE TRUCK HORN DON'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO THE REAL TRUCK HORN. IT'S LOUD IF YOU ARE STANDING BY IT. MIGHT WORK BETTER IF U WOULD BUY A BETTER SPEAKER. THE SWITCH LOOKS CHEEP ALL PLASTIC. YOU WILL NEED MORE WIRE TO HOOK IT UP, I WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN. I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT TRYING TO FIND A BETTER ONE MAYBE ONE OFF A REAL POLICE CAR."
2,Get what you pay for,Well...i laughed when i hooked this up. Sounds nothing like the real deal. Speaker is not loud at all. In all honesty its a waist of $30.00. Im thinkin about sending it back.
5,Provacative,"Mark Osmun's great imagination has taken us behind the scenes of a story we have read or watched on television annually since we were kids. Even with our familiarity with the story we knew virtually nothing about Jacob Marley, without whom The Christmas Carol would never have been written. Five stars for cleverness alone. To his credit, Osmun chose not to imitate the Dicken's style yet he put coal dust in my teeth together with a clostrophobic shortness of breath as I read through Marley's experience. Marley's journey is a wonderful metaphor for the journey we all travel as we ask questions about good and evil and our relationships with God and our fellow man. Marley's quest to save Scrooge is a journey of love from a man who has known everything but love. ""When the time comes - How will you choose?"""
5,"A compelling, superbly crafted, original, memorable novel.","In Marley's Ghost, Mark Osmun has written a brilliant ""prequel"" to Charles Dickens' classic ""A Christmas Carol"". Here is the story of Jacob Marley whose ghost appeared to Ebenezer Scrooge to announce the coming of three spirits that legendary Christmas Eve. Jacob was a fugitive, prodigy, gambler, miner, mentor, corruptor and Ebenezer's partner in exploiting the vulnerable, the unwary, and the needy. Jacob was himself both victim and villain, capable of nobility and vile behavior. After his death Jacob wanders a frozen hell seeking answers and redemption. There he becomes a pawn in the battle between Light and Dark, ultimately compelled to choose between God and the Devil as the future of all human kind hangs in the balance. Marley's Ghost is a compelling, superbly crafted, original novel that does full justice to Dickens and is a memorable testament which may well become a classic itself!"
4,Fantastically imaginative & compelling,"Osmun created a fantastic voyage into 18th century English life -- particularly the dark side. We all know the ending before we begin, but I am in awe of how he got us there. This is a deeper, more insightful novel than a Christmas Carol."
2,not worth it,"Before you go spend money on exam prep information, be sure you know what lies ahead when testing for a fire job. It requires a relentless amount of testing, and most departments already have who they want hired before the go through the process of testing everyone else."
2,Poor Priscilla,Was there anything about Elvis Presley that Priscilla liked? Priscilla Presley has been making money off of Elvis since the day he died. Very sad from a woman that supposedly loved him so much.
3,An Honest Book.,"Even though I am a big fan of Elvis Presley, I have never read a book about him before but - I read this one in one sitting! However, without being judgmental about her permissive parents, the book is traight forward, answers a lot - nearly all. And, if Priscilla Presley tried to put her point across, she succeeded with me. Now I am a fan of Priscilla, too. Sorry, Cilla, it took me so long!"
1,Junk and Slanted Opinions,"I've read this book and have seen the movie. Believe me, if you get a chance, read ""Child Bride"" a fantastic book that will clear up all the pretentiousness of this writing, for it appears that Priscilla has written what she wants everyone to believe. Perhaps she believes her made up stories herself by now. Don't bother wasting your money."
1,disappointed product condition,"This used paperback novel was advertised as ""excellent or outstanding condition"" but was far from that upon receipt. The quality was poor at best. I would not recommend buying any used book(s) from Amazon if this is their practice. Very disappointed."
2,the king and Priscilla,"when I read this book, about Priscilla and Elvis....I liked it in a way but in another way,I don't feel the least bit sorry for her because she knew exactly what she was marrying into,she should of thought it over and asked herself......*Am I doing the right thing,marrying the most famous sex symbol in the world?* but she didn't and the fact is she must of cared alot for his money because she asked for alot when she got divorced from him and then wanted more afterwards.So half of me feels sorry but the other half doesn't."
5,Elivs and Me,Great book. Love to read books written by those closest to Elvis. Gives you a look into how he viewed the women in his life.
4,I really enjoyed it.,"I found myself not able to put this book down. I admit that a lot of the information I had already heard before. It was still really good. A lot of reviewers on here say that it's made up lies, but how do they know, they weren't there. I know a lot of stuff was left out of the book and it even says so at the very end that she left out a lot. It could have went into more detail in some areas but it was still a good read."
3,I'm not sure that I liked this book.,It was definitely worth reading. But I didn't enjoy reading it. Elvis came across as a spoiled child and someone who could be cruel and heartless at times and I didn't like that at all.Left me with a lot of unanswered questions and doubts.
1,typical glossed over celeb bio,"I have had a change a heart about this book, if you read it when it first came out in the 80's, you thought it was a great book. But now over 15 years later alot of inconsistencies arise but since Priscilla is Priscilla no one has really ever dared to question her. Alot of people who were interviwed for Child Bride tell a diffrent story, so many that their stories can't be explained away because i have always believed were there is smoke, is fire.In regards to the fact that Priscilla did date quite alot but she says she hardly did and when Priscilla was supposedly giving Elvis encouragment in the TV movie. Another side came about to where she was mocking him, laughing behind his back over the snowmobile suit he was wearing. And on and on, don't buy this book because if you really read it, you will come away with alot more questions then answers. But if you like the usual spin, you will love this one.."
2,Elvis and me,I saw the movie by the same name of this book. It was fine for me at first. I enjoyed it very much. First time readers about Elvis will like this book. Ellen
2,Does not scratch the surface of the truth.,"Priscilla's account of her years with Elvis from the time they met in Germany up until the divorce is gappy, and full of self-pity. This reader would like to know, for one, more about her true feelings. I got the impression from reading this book that Priscilla was writing about the reactions around her instead of delving into herself and providing the insight that only the wife of the King of Rock'n'Roll could tell. She is good when it comes to funny stories about her life with Elvis, but spare when it comes to the deep feelings of rejection and sadness that she must have felt. It is for this reason, and this reason alone, that I did not feel justified in rating this book with more than two stars."
2,Presenting The Priscilla Myth,"Simplistic in its writing style, Priscilla tells about her life and her relationship with The King. The truth is heavily embellished and ""Priscilla-tized"", making for a great romance novel but not for an accurate account of how she met Elvis and their relationship. If you do read this book, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read ""Child Bride"" by Suzanne Finstad along with it, and judge for yourself if Miss Priscilla is being completely honest with herself and with her readers. I could not help but feel a strong underlying resentment and jealousy towards Elvis that seeps through her narration. Priscilla's book has many interesting revelations and anecdotes, but after you read ""Child Bride"", it's more intriguing to see what Priscilla didn't include in her autobiography than what she did."
2,Elvis and Me and the clothes we wore,"That would of been a more appropriate title. I could not believe how fixated Priscilla is on her and Elvis's clothes. Grant it they were show-biz people and Elvis certainly liked clothes and obviously dressing Priscilla, but it seems every event she recalls is tied into their clothing apparel. Still it is quite enjoyable to see a side of Elvis form his one true love. The Elvis insights are great but the remembrances about herself are very weak, even though she was very young through the story she comes across as a very shallow person or maybe she just doesn't want to tell."
2,the gospel according to priscilla,"While parts of this book are interesting-the inside information on Elvis, and their life together, for example-there's just a little too much of ""poor,pitiful, long-suffering Priscilla"". Apparently she wasn't scarred to badly by the experience-she has shrewdly kept the presley surname and continues to pass herself off as The Widow Presley, despite their divorce and her continuing not-too-believeable claims that she wants to be known for ""herself""-not just as Elvis's wife-make that EX wife. This book is ultimately self-congratulatory and predictable. Pass."
1,Angry and Brutal To the Max!,"Wow! Written after his death--before Elvis became the billion dollar ""Cash Cow"" that he is today--the author had no idea that the King would go on and become even bigger after death! The ex-wife obviously thought ""Elvis was over"" and that it was the beginning of her career.The book has got to be the coldest and cruelest rip off of the world's greatest entertainer. Her anger is so great that even after Elvis' death,the book was like she was trying to saw his coffin in two! How do true Elvis fans stand it that she is profiting so greatly from someone she so blantantly profaned to the world? The rape accusation--was that really necessary? She pictured Elvis as a blundering, drug crazed, frigid, psycho, sexual predator. I'm offended and the dead can't defend themselves.Obviously, the greatest tragedy in his life was his marriage to her. Shocking and very sad."
5,Great Book!,"I thought this book was great! I read it when I was 11 and just recently now and I am 16. I found the book great for Elvis fans to get to know him better. I like the book so much that I've let my friends read it, I would suggest this book to anyone!"
5,Short and to the Point,"This book is a wonderful introductory grammar for Biblical Aramaic. It gives you everything you need to know, and doesn't overwhelm the reader. Charts, vocab, grammar, all in one very small book at a great price! Any Biblical Hebrew student should get this book to strengthen their understanding of Hebrew and semetic languages."
5,Saved my life!,"We use this at Charnock Institute of the Bible. As a personal note, it saved my life when I was taking Aramaic in Seminary. I was confused by the books I was using and ordered this just to take a look. It put is all together for me. Biblical Aramaic is not a complete language which is easy to reconstruct. So there are missing elements to be expected. But a student would learn what is needed and what is not."
4,Does just what it says on the box,"This is a good book for studying Biblical Aramaic. If you're ultimately interested in other phases of the language, it would be a good way to start. It's short, compact, reasonably challenging, and pretty serious. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because I find the author's style quite dull, and it really requires prior knowledge of Hebrew (or another Semitic language) to begin reading -- since the prerequisites aren't mentioned anywhere besides one of the first pages, I consider it a drawback."
2,What was she thinking?,"I'm gracing this book with two stars only because Catherine Coulter wrote it. The book certainly doesn't deserve it. Having read most of Coulter's other work, I can only conclude that she was having some sort of mental lapse during this book's creation. I would never have matched this hero and heroine. There was simply no connection between them, besides him saving her. They should have just been friends and gone on to more pleasant love stories. Also, there was much cruelty throughout the book--calculated rape, punishment, etc. I stopped reading this book several times, and only completed it out of sheer boredom on a rainy day. Unlike most other books of this genre, I was not left with warm, happy feelings after reading it. Disturbed and tormented would be a more acurate description. I do not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a strong, sound love story. You'll be left wanting and unsatisfied."
1,Another Awful Duplicate,Another story that started out strong but fizzled fast. Appalling characters.
2,Uneventful and poorly planned.,"I have been an admirer of Tim's drumming since his beginnings with Primus, and I'm a drummer of 25 years. I think his performance on this DVD was disappointing and uninspiring. It's quite obvious that he didn't take the time to warm up before the performance, nor did he take the time to become familiar with the borrowed drum kit. The camera angles didn't help. It would have been nice to SEE his footwork on the tracks where it is hilighted. I don't think Tim put much time, thought, and preparation into this project. At best, it's a mediocre basement tape that should have been left in the basement. Sorry Tim. You can do better than this. I hope the next one shines because this one, unlike Primus, really sucks."
5,WOW!,"I think that Brie is an AMAZING singer, i love her song She Said and this DVD is AWESOME too! I cant wait for her full album!. This is a MUST buy for Lindsay Lohan or Hilary Duff fans!!!!!BRIE U ROCK!"
5,Best DVD ever,"Wow, this DVD is amazing because it has the uber cool She Said music video! I can now watch it as many time as I want instead of having it load online. It is the best video ever. It even makes fun of rich girls like Nicole and Paris. Also, there are edgy rock song performances like Done With Like, She Said, and Finally Out of PE. I cannot wait for her album. It is gonna be hard rock, just like her videos. Buy it now or you'll lose out. Brie rocks."
5,bRiE LaRsOn FaN fOrEvEr!!,omg .. this DVD is ssoo amazing!! it has 4 really good songs on it .. (with tha single she said and tha video) .. and a really cool 'backstage look' of making her new CD 'Finially Out Of P.E.' .. note tha title of the DVD lol .. I LOVE BRIE .. she is so nice (yes i have met her lol .. so im not just saying that)
4,Good quality OEM replacement.,Flexible Shaft CableGood quality flex shaft fits older Dremel and Craftsman variable speed tools. Machined aluminum parts actually seem a little sturdier than OEM. Slightly noisier when operating than OEM.
2,Has nothing to do with Vegas,"A collection of 50's and 60's songs that have nothing to with Vegas. Well... except maybe some or all of the performers performed in Vegas at some point. Oh well, it was cheap, I bought it used."
1,Didn't happen that way,"This was a very convincing book, but I'm glad I didn't follow the advice and bought heavily into stock, expecting to sell out at top prices in 2009!"
1,"Still Waitin' on that 40,000 Dow, Harry!!","This guy's out with yet another book in January predicting another depression. So what happened, Harry? Did I sleep through that 40,000 Dow?? Oh, okay. Just another 32,000 points to go and THEN we'll have a depression. Not bloody likely.Assuming you haven't lost everything you owned following this guy's advice in the past, save the last $20 you might have salvaged and DON'T buy this or any other book the guy comes out with."
1,Harry Dent living in the past.,"Harry Dent brings out some good points in his book, but he is not in touch with the developing world with Terrorism; Oil Prices; and the huge amount of US debt that has developed over time. This is inflationary! Right now the US debt is 300% of the GDP. Also, I did some research and found out one of his co-horts was betting against the market. Check this website: http://www.market-innovations.com/about.htmlIt looks like Norm is promoting the stocks to go down and has been on Harry Dent's forecast letter. So Harry what is it. Bull or Bear Market? In Harry's previous book he promoted the DJIA to reach 30,000 and now he changes his mind to 40,000. How intoxicating for wishful thinkers. This is why economist never make any money in the market. Its all theory."
1,Who is worse? Dent or Cramer?,"I was conned. I admit it. I signed up for his monthly newsletter. You know what it kept saying? ""There's plenty of oil!"" - Oil went to 140 bucks. Dent claims ""we'll have a dip in 2007, then it will be the best buying opportunity of a lifetime"". If you had listened to him, your portfolio would be down more than 50% - I believed this fool for a while but when none of his predictions came true and everything he mentioned went OPPOSITE (as of this writing the DOW is now at 8000) - Let this be a warning to others not to believe Dent - He was WRONG, WRONG, WRONG."
2,Unanswered Questions,"People like to think that somehow, some way, somebody can look into the future and tell what lies ahead for them. Thus they can avoid the bad things and take action that will benefit them...(usually this means make a fortune while others lose theirs..). Sorry, you know that just isn't so. Somebody will get lucky and be right in their predictions, and some will have great records, but all gurus have their day,miss, and then the party is over. There are some good ideas in this book, but you would be better served, in my opinion, by putting your money with proven genius and honesty over a life time. Google Berkshire Hathaway B Stock, a holding company run by Warren Buffett. More people will retire early because of this man and his company than just about any other I know of...He is a true value investor. Billy"
5,"The Next Great Bubble Boom: How to PRofit from the Greatest Boom in History, 2005-2009","Once again, Harry Dent provides new insightful thinking on matters of critical importance - especially planning for retirement. Financial professionals should consider this book a must read, as it will set them apart from their competitors. Individual investors will learn more than most advisors know, and position themselves to see through the myriad of schemes and scams they'll be exposed to when someone finds out they have a big 401(k) to rollover. If nothing else, readers should rush to the section on ""Where Do I Want to Be Living in the Great Bust Ahead?"" This book makes sense, and Harry Dent is a master at making complex research interesting and understandable. Terry Reid, President, Project Management Express, Inc."
4,"Good book, good idea, timing a little off","Very good book at predicting long-term trends. However, his short-term analysis and predictions are a little off the mark, sometimes by a few years. As long as you don't take his advice as ""short term advice"" then I would say the book is very good, if not brilliant. His analysis is refreshing, unique, and definitely worth considering. His book is just not a replacement for investment advice. I would call it ""a manual to what the future holds, and how you can be prepared to tackle it""."
2,Old predictions that have not come true,"This book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 & 2006 - most of which are inacurate. His boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing - and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions (DOW over 40,000) presented in this book."
2,"I'd like to believe Dent, but reality is proving him wrong.","Harry S. Dent is definitely qualified to write this book, so I'm disappointed to say that his economic predictions so far are not panning out.One thing Dent bases his predictions on is the dollar rising against the euro, which hasn't happened. He also predicted a bull market rally from late 2005 to mid-2006, with targets for mid to late 2006 at 14,000 - 15,000 on the Dow, which also didn't happen.Dent is right about the bubble and wrong about the boom, and I strongly suggest buying ""America's Bubble Economy"" by David Weidemer instead."
1,Stunningly bad advice...,"This book was highly recommended to me by my money manager. What a mistake - both the book and the manager. Good advice would have been to sell my house in 2007 - at any cost. Now, nobody will buy it.One thing is certain - never buy a book on generic financial advice, unless you want to make the writer rich."
1,The great shameless forecaster: nothing more than a joke,"Instead of ""the next great bubble boom in 2006-1010"", what happened in reality is a great crash of the market and economy in 2008-2009. This author is really a shameless forecaster. He didn't understand economy at all."
1,Dent is a crackpot,"Look back at Dent's track record. This guy is selling worthless predictions that rarely come true because he cannot factor in things like terrorism, wars, etc. His books should be labelled ""For entertainment purposes only""."
1,"Read the ""Great Boom Ahead"" instead of this book.","Harry Dent called the stock market boom in the 90's like no one else. He also predicted the 2002-2003 dip. It just was not in this book! Back in the early 90's he wrote ""The Great Boom Ahead"" that foretold the market well for the next 12 years. Not many came even close to his predictions. So Mr. Dent became famous and what does he do? He completely contrdicts his orignal work and writes this junk! (along with his other bad book ""Roaring 2000's"").Read the original and great masterpiece and skip the others. Mr Dent's predictions in ""The Boom"" have stood well for the last 14 years, perhaps he is on a roll and the next 15 will be spot on also."
1,Is is boring always being right?,"This book was a real struggle. I have heard Harry speak previously and I think he is pretty good. As an author, though, his massive ego weighs down his writing.Too much of this book is spent explaining how he has called every turn of the market in the last 10 years. Also, he treats demographics as though he personally invented the concept.Overall, this book is just an attempt to convince the reader that his previous book, The Great Boom Ahead will be proven right, after all."
5,This is an exciting book.,"This book is about when Annie thinks Alex relies on her powers too much. So she bets Alex that she can't go 24 hours without them. But when Alex tries, she finds out that someone is watching her.I think that this is an exciting book and I recommend that you read it. This book is enjoyable because it is a challenging terrific book. Erin K, age 9 from San Jose, CA."
5,This is the best cookbook I own!,"I started ernestly cooking vegetarian food a couple of years ago. I have amassed a large resource of vegetarian cookbooks and recipes. The cookbook I return to often, especially when I want to make something I can depend upon, is Annie Somerville's book. Her recipes are always reliable and use ingredients that I can come by pretty easily (in the Northwest). She has taught me a lot about how to cook with recipe explanations that really tell you what you're doing without making you feel you need a chef's degree in order to pull it off. And often, when I can choose between a couple of resources to make the same thing, Annie's recipe tastes better. I wish she would put another cookbook together. Why let Deborah Madsen have all the fun?"
5,The Best!,This is the best vegetarian cookbook I have ever used. All recipes are packed with flavor.
4,A bit exotic,"The recipes are a little exotic with unusal vegetables and combinations, but a excellent cookbook nonetheless. A great cookbook for recipes for a romantic dinner that is completely vegetarian."
5,WOOOT! YOGA + JODI = LOTS O' FUN!,"Jodi Stolove is awesome.We are 'treated' to the benefits of yoga in this exercise video, another entry in her 'chair' series. With it, people who do not have a full range of motion can exercise and partake in a series of 'yoga-esque' type movements.I work with a number of people and we do this WEEKLY. They adore it, and I adore Jodi for having yet another winning video that works to ENABLING people to reach to their potential, physical limitations be darned.Jodi, you ROCK!"
3,Good,These are possibly my favorite eppisodes out of all 224 eppies of YGO: DM.I actually haven't watched these certain eppies uncut YET (I have them on DVD uncut in Japanese) but most times the dub makes me want to change the channel; these eps aren't like that.If you don't mind the dub (I hate it) get this DVD to get some great eppies but I'm gonna stick with buying my imports.
2,Really confusing menus,"When it works, its great...but even after regular use, I'm not comfortable with the menu system. Everything seems to be controlled by 2 of the side buttons and the one big red button...but navigating the thing is so illogical and confusing that I hardly use it anymore."
3,"Watch is fine, but manual is a little confusing","I had a Nordic Track heart rate monitor watch before this one and it was very easy to use. I recently broke it...changing the battery, so if the manual says have an expert change the battery *sheepish grin* it is better to listen. I was looking to buy a comparable watch with maybe a few more if not similar features. This Polar watch has so many functions it was a little daunting at first. The manual is confusing and it took me an hour (maybe longer) to set the watch exactly as I wanted it. So far the watch has worked fine for my running and aeorobic routines. I really like the quick transmitter review of min and max heart rate as well as TIZ without having to push a button. I would recommend it to those who do not mind putting in the time understanding the manual and one who needs all the different functions."
4,It meets my expectations,"The S120 meets my expectations, I use it alot at the gym & riding my Mountain Bike. I recommend if you are a person who is looking to keep track of the info from this monitor, the S150 and a few other models has an attachment which you can plug into your computer. Also the S150 has a mount for your bike and alot more useful options. All in all I am happy with the S120 it is simple to use and I have no complaints."
1,GOOD GOD! THE WORST OF THE 13!,"Ok, first off for all of you people that wrote that the movie was great, you didn't even see the Japanes one! The true one! Out of all the 13 movies, this is one of the worst. Barelly any plot, you go from one thing, to something with nothing to do with it, in about 2 seconds. The fighting isn't really that great. Movie 13 should be subbed my Amazon, but UNCUT! That means with all the cursing, pervertedness, and REAL action. Akira must have had a headache when he came up with this."
3,this is joey now using aol!,These movies got old. Now that GT is out nobody cares about these. Personally I like Lord Slug when Goku goes 1/2 super saiyan but that's a different boxed set.
4,World's Strongest Review,"If u want to buy a quality Dbz movie i'd suggest this one. There is action, thrill, and power obbsession all in one neat little package. If u miss out on this you truely aren't a dbz fan. The animation in this is truely amazing and the dubbing is suberb. I gave it 4 stars which it earned. Now the story line is weak but if your like me i say screw story line show me hardcore battle sequences. By now every true dbz fan should know all dbz is about is fighting. I love this movie and suggest it for a dbz fan to add to there collection. You'd be a fool to miss out on this. Buy it or i'll send you to another dimension"
4,A really good dub.,"For the previous dubs that FUNimation did (despite the recently dubbed episodes), this movie surely makes up for their poor dubbing, because people die now, they don't get blasted to the 'Next Dimension'.I do like this movie though, and the fact that the entire thing didn't go uncensored. The title theme for the movie 'Head-cha-la' was really neat, and I liked it muchly.The fighting scenes, and the original North American seiyuu also made this movie cool, with the great way it was dubbed, the newer voices wouldn't have done as good as a job.So, out of the three movies I've seen so far, 'The Tree of Might' and 'Dead Zone', this is the best of all three. I can't wait until the next movie gets released. The music was good, the plot was awesome, and the fighting scenes were really cool, and for those parents with kids under ten, I suggest you rent this first. If you don't mind what your kid sees, buy it, you will like it."
3,"Is the Pioneer ""uncut"" the same as the Funimation ""uncut""?","I was reading you DBZ reviews (great by the way!) and had a question...Pioneer is known for their editing of DBZ, and Funimation is known for showing it uncut!... I have the old Pioneer 1-3 movie Box Set and it says its ""UNCUT""... is it the same as the Funimation ""UNCUT"" movies 1-3?"
5,Best of the first 3 movies.,"I bought the boxed set of Tree of Might, Dead Zone, and World's Strongest. World's strongest was the best because it is the most cussing I have ever heard in english diolge for DBZ. Granted it only says ""damn"" and ""hell"" but still. It is so much cooler than the kiddy stuff they show on TV. When you hear it in english.........it is so tight. This singal DVD is rare so you might as well buy the boxed set like I did. The other movies don't cuss as much but, but they are still really good. Tree of might is good too."
4,Roshi still has what it takes.,"A couple of mad scientists plot to take over the world with their advanced biotechnology. Dr. Wheelo's body died many years ago, but his brain survived. His partner is after Master Roshi to transplant Wheelo's brain into Roshi's body. The combination of the brightest mind and the strongest body will make taking the world easy. There's just one problem. Wheelo's information is outdated. Roshi has been surpassed and is no longer Earth's strongest warrior. Goku is. When Goku shows up the plan changes and a fierce battle begins.This is a really cool movie. It's fun to see Roshi put the smack don on these android bad guys. This is one of my favorite DBZ movies. It's a must have for any DBZ fan."
5,Pioneer Knows What They're Doing!,"Anyone wonder how the dub of DBZ would be if the show landed in better hands? Nows your chance. For one reason or another, Pioneer ended up with the rights to the first 3 DBZ movies (Instead of FUNimation), and the end results speak for themselves! This thing just screams quality! The dubbing is good, and very close to the original Japanesse script (FUNimation NEVER came close to being on the dot)! The music is left untouched, and you even get to hear the ORIGINAL theme song! After hearing this it's hard to think kind of the American theme songs and score.Not to mention the DVD has better picture quality then the FUNimation releases! Folks, I don't know if buying enough of these means Pioneer will be able to dub more DBZ (Although it won't likely ever happen again), but it's nice to have a company know what they're doing for once! Get this DVD...and see dubbed DBZ the way it should have all along!"
4,"""The Second Movie!""","This is the second DBZ movie of the 13. It is awesome but gets boring after the Piccolo/Goku fight. In this, Dr. Willow kidnapps Piccolo, Master Roshi, and Bulma. Dr. Willow's brain was frozen for 50 years and now he wants to take of Roshi's body, thinking that Roshi is the strongest. However, upon learning that Goku is the world's strongest, Willow has a new target! In Japan, this movie was released in 1990 under the name ""The World's Strongest Man,"" so the title didn't change that much. The plot, as I said, gets boring at times, but is very cool and action-packed. Well-drawn, and great voice talents, this DBZ movie is one to remember for all-time..."
4,exhilarating pulsating anime action,"this one kicks batoot as Goku, Piccolo, Krillin and Gohan battle the unfrozen evil DR. Wheelio. Dr. Wheelio manipulates Piccolo and turns him to his side and the fight with Piccolo and Goku(because the fans know they were rivals back in the day) is a highlight and theres breathtaking nemesis's including when Goku gets frozen and then fights those 2 henchmen. the end with the big explosion is amazing too."
5,It is the best movie ever,Need...More...DBZ...VIDEOS This is the best video ever made i have watched this film 50 or more times.
4,dragon ball z,"I think this video is one, of the best dragon ball z videos made. One it shows lots of acton and two, the oponents aren't weaklings.Thats why I like this video"
4,This movie is great overall!,"""The World's Strongest"" is by far one of the best DBZ movies ever! Even though it's short (1 hour), it is awesome! The evil Dr. Weelow is trying to find the world's strongest fighter so he can take over his body and put his brain into the strongest fighter's head (Dr. Weelow is only a brain in a big metal destruction creature body thingamajig). If he does that, Dr. Weelow's evil but brilliant mind combined with the world's strongest fighter's body would be almost indestructable! If you've guessed, the strongest fighter's body is Goku's. You have to watch it to see what happens!"
5,THIS MOVIE KICKS #@%,This has got to the best of any DBZ animated movie in the world. The actions starts right away and doesnt start till its over. This movie is way beyond 5 stars
3,NOT FOR MACBOOK PRO,"Even though my Macbook Pro is also a 15"" mac, the Hoodman doesn't fit properly. I wrote the company about it and they wrote back saying that the newer computers were a little different. Wish this had been made clear on their website.Seems like a good product for older macs.Ignore 3 star rating - can't evaluate properly."
1,"Amateurish, Juvenile Music At best","Music composition, like playing an instrument, is an art that posesses a technique and a discipline to acheive mastery and control over the material at hand. Though there are some composers who were self taught and got on the right path, Mohr isn't one of them. This music is simplistic in conception, badly orchestrated,loosely held together, and reminds me of a lot of music I and other composers were writing as sophomores in college. Also, the CD is not mixed well and is poorly edited (if at all). The only merit this work has (and possibly the only reason this ever got recorded) is a fascinating story behind the piece that would undoubtedly sell a few copies to those who care to spend the money (BTW- don't spend the money, buy a milkshake or something instead). Why did you do this, NAXOS? Oh, why!!!"
5,transformative music,"Listening to Chris Mohr's opera was a very moving experience. I spent an evening by myself listening and reading along with the powerfully descriptive text. The music was beautiful, lyrical and innovative. It elicited a journey of my own in which I explored moving through pain to peace. I highly recommend this musical healing experience."
1,Environmental EIT guide,"This book did not help at all. They basically just explained the formulas in then Environmental Engineering section of the reference manual (which you probably have in textbooks anyway) and had some practice problems relating to those formulas. However, the actual test pulled mostly from Civil Engineering and the problems were nothing like the ones in this book."
5,Great Book for Understanding Chinese Writing!,This books provides a great introduction for students and teachers to the Chinese language.
2,Heavy hand,"This is a play where the message was conceived first, and the play and characters were constructed around it. The result is a heavy handed didactic piece. One can endure heavy handedness, however, if the teaching is other than banal. In the case of this play, one only endures."
1,Not what I thought,"For $ 17.00, I expected more than 126 pages and some real information. I am very disappointed. What a poor product."
1,Not worth shipping or price at any cost,"Hodge podge of worthwhile but only a few quotations presented with no reference order except by authors radomly found through the book; why sometimes it is better to shop at a bookstore and see what you are getting. At best, a bathroom reader."
3,Nice Gift,This is a nice book. I am a fan of quotations. this book is a delight for those who collect quotations as a hobby and also for those of you who would just like to have quotations at their finger tips. Great Gift too.
5,lessons in identifying favorable risk-reward opportunities,"Readers of George Muzea's ""The Vital Few vs. The Trivial Many"" will benefit from his wisdom as the foremost practitioner of insider-trading analysis and his decades of experience in the stock market, which includes providing advice to a number of highly successful professional investors. Making money in the stock market, year in and year out, is about being disciplined, and capitalizing on market inefficiencies and favorable risk-reward opportunities. Reading ""The Vital Few vs. The Trivial Many"" is an important step towards understanding and applying these means to successful investing."
2,Very little value,This book gives a few useful insights about interpreting insider trading for making better investing decisions. Almost every thing you need to know from this book is summarized in two pages (pages 106-107). The rest of the book is a lot of repetition and many useless stories that add no value what so ever.
4,Follow the Insiders,"The best thing about this book is that it is rather short. All the insightful information can be distilled into a mere dozen pages or so but since the nuggets are dispersed thoroughout the book, it would profit to read the whole thing. Just skip the nonsensical stories and try not to cringe at the earnest high school level writing style.I still recommend this book because it is rare to find a trading/investing book which focus is on following the transactions of public companies' insiders. In my opinion, insider information is one of the most important tools necessary to make high probability trading decisions."
5,"Great performance for the money, even better with Escient.","Yes, the DVD browsing interface is archaic. However, for the money, you're not going to get much better. Pair this with a Escient DVDM-300 and it's unbeatable! It's fast and plays DVD's decently for a multi-disc changer."
1,Does Not Read DVD Labels & Sony Could Care Less,"Great idea, poor follow through, no support. After loading over 350 DVD's, only 20 or so lables/titles were actually read by the player. Calling Sony resulted in ""the player can't load the title to some DVD's."" A more accurate response would be ""the player can load the title of a few DVD's."" Sony was very non-responsive and definitely had a care less attitude. Had we known this before purchasing the machine, we would not have wasted the money. The manual is poorly written, unclear and in small print - perhaps more to confuse the consumer, than to help.In any event, if you don't mind loading all the titles to the 400 DVD's you will load, then this is an OK machine. Me, I have much better things to do and it is much easier to look up and load a disc than to try and guess what disc is in what slot."
2,Beware of damaged discs,"After reading several of the reviews concerning damaged discs I went and started looking at my discs. What I found was very disheartening. So far I have unloaded about 250 of the discs and have found 30 scratched ones. They have the half moon scratches described in the other posts. About five I would characterize as gouges rather than scratches. I bought this changer to use with the Escient fireball as others have and found the quality to be otherwise average. I have had the unit for 5 years and it is full. I have a video issue where the brightness flashes occasionally, but I don't know if that is the player or the Fireball causing the problem. I know it is not the monitor or receiver. I like watching music dvds and I find the whole experience superb with the video and audio playing through my home theater system. It's just a shame the thing is damaging the DVDs."
1,WORKS FOR 10 MONTHS THEN EATS YOUR DVD COLLECTION!!!,BUYER BEWARE! I HAVE HAD TWO OF THESE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. BOTH WORKED FINE FOR 10 MONTHS AND THEN WENT INTO AN UNCONTROLLED MODE OF CHANGING FROM ONE DISC TO THE NEXT CONTINUOUSLY. THIS CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE NOT THERE TO TURN OFF THE UNIT RESULTING IN YOUR ENTIRE DVD COLLECTION BEING DESTROYED. THIS IS NOT COVERED BY YOUR HOMEOWNERS POLICY NOR SONY AS I CHECKED INTO THIS. THANKFULLY A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY WAS THERE BOTH TIMES TO UNPLUG THE UNIT BEFORE THE DVD'S WERE SCRATCHED BEYOND REPAIR.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!!
4,Compartively speaking,"The remote stinks, and I wish Sony had kept the mega-changer feature from the previous model. I have also had some problems with it not accepting keyboard input but otherwise the unit works well, rarely if ever skips, can play MP3 DVD collections and all formats of DVD's I've tried so far. Very convenient to have all my movies on tap all the time!I wish the menu speed was faster, that the remote was laid out better and that it still had mega-control capability, otherwise I'd rate it a 5."
3,Had to send it back The metal drills were rusting in the box,Product looked good from previous reviews delivery was good. Upon opening the sealed wooden box I found that the drill bites had all ready started rusting in the boxUpon examination it appears that the worker never cleaned his finger prints off the metal with a oil rag. The rest marks were from finger prints. If the drill bite metal started rusting in the box. It appears that they would become rusty and discolored in a shot priod of time in a shop. Poor Quality metal rusts that fast NO THANK YOU
1,Filthy,This product was dirty and grimy. Reeked to high heaven of cigarette smoke. There was grim between the display screen and the digital clock read out.
3,It was cheaper at Walmart.,"Mark Twain reviewer was right, it is $25.64 at Walmart. I am giving this item 3 stars because Amazon wants nearly $10 more for the same item."
4,not impressed,I have had this player for a couple of months and I do have trouble playing cd-r's...it stutters and this is verrrrry irritating. I will be looking for another to replace it. It plays pre-recorded cd's beautifully.
3,"Missing features advertised, but still acceptable","Ditto S. Greenwood's review. It is missing all the features he or she listed. It is also available at Wal-Mart for $29.95.However, it's not a bad radio. The sound is decent, and the dual-function wake-ups were the main selling factor for me. You can even set the cd track you want to wake up to. It's easy to set the time, and the cd player has shuffle and repeat settings. I like the features for the price. In fact, if it hadn't been advertised with features it didn't have, I probably would have rated it higher."
1,A real disappointment,"We bought this item at Walmart as a Christmas gift for our daughter and while it worked for a while (about 3 months or so), the CD player stopped working. We sent it to the address listed in the manual and it took about 3 months to get another one. And, lo and behold, the replacement unit doesn't work at all!Pass on this and get something of higher quality."
2,LIGHT BRIGHT!,"This clock radio had some nice features but the backlit time was way too bright.I even went so far as buying a little bit on static cling vinyl window tint to cover the front of the clock. It still was a night light for the bedroom.The CD features were nice, but overall it seemed ill-designed. For example every time I went to set ALARM 1 or ALARM 2, this stupid ""NAP"" feature always got activated, to which I always had to turn it off. It was a constant headache. The buttons didn't seem to well placed either. I did like that you could adjust the SNOOZE time, but that was about it.I picked this up at Wal-Mart, which was a travesty in itself, and returned it a few weeks later. I am now using my old Sony Dream Machine from 1997 until a better one comes along..."
4,Not too bad.,"For the price this little box does a fair job. When I first got it I noticed a buzzing noise coming from my TVs speakers, when I disconnected the Coby box it went away. I found that the volume level on the Coby box was set to midrange and pushing it up to just under maximum cleared the buzzing. I like the ability on the remote to switch from 480i to 480p to 720p and 1080i. My biggest complaint about this box is the limited picture sizing control (no zoom or wide stretch.) Again, aside from this it does a fair job"
4,Wrong but good.,Instead of the Coby I received a Samsung SIR-T451 from Horsie Love. The Samsung is a better Brand/Model. I am happy with this. I told Horsie Love about this and asked for a receipt for the Samsung and never got a receipt for the Samsung.
2,Limited abilities - will not work with cable,"Works fine with a antenna, but will not pick up HD channels from the cable service. Our cable service provides both analog and digital channels, but the receiver will not pick up the digital channels. We have one other newer TV in the house, and it picks up both analog and digital channels from the cable without any problems."
1,does not recieve channels 2-13,"a call to customer service was worthless, I was told that I wouldn't be able to get any channels, I told them that I'm getting over 50 UHF stations, but not one VHF. They called me a liar and insisted that there was nothing wrong with the box. It is junk and the company's customer service is horrible. I don't reccomend dealing with this manufacurer at all."
4,"Very good tuner, but not great.","Picks up all channels on 2nd floor on house, but misses 2 of 12 channels on the 1st floor. Twenty miles away from broadcasting channels and only using an indoor amplified antenna. What is really sweet is my old HD tunerless 32"" HDTV is working again!"
4,crazytraci,I had not read a novel for ages! My mother left this book on her visit and I was unable to put it down! I just found out it has a sequel! I can't wait to read it!
5,The great American Novel,"I've read thousands of books in my life, among them Theodore Dreiser, Thomas Wolfe, John Steinbeck and Hemingway, but none of them impressed me as much as ""Rich Man, Por Man"" by Irwin Shaw.They don't write novels like that anymore..."
3,"Great characters, forgettable story","This book has a certain hypnotic fascination. The very first page introduces us to the young Rudolph Jordache in such technicolour one could describe him as if he were a friend. This is followed by a dazzling array of characters, all superbly described, all amazingly unique, and every single one a delight. Even the most minor character is not spared loving attention by the author. The events happen thick and fast, and the twists in the story are certainly interesting. The language is descriptive, and fun to read. One is drawn to the characters, and is, by turns, elated at their successes, and disappointed by their failures.But at the end of the book, one feels cheated: the writer seems to have made a conscious decision to call it a day. The many promising themes of the book are tossed away, and the loose strands brought together in an untidy mess."
1,BAD EXPIERENCE,Very disapointed in the condition of the book I ordered. It was like a hole cup of coffee had been spilled throughout the entire book. I agreed to buying a used book but the condition was so poor it should have never been sold to me!
1,Unreadable condition,"This book was listed as 'very good' condition when in reality it was so dirty, discolored and smelly that it is unreadable. The vendor did promptly give me a full refund but I was extremely disappointed with the condition of the book."
1,Ballast goes bad after 12 months ... $200 to replace ballast!!!,"Home remodel incl guest bathroom ...Nice looking unit, quietHave replaced the bulbs twice in 2 yearsNow the ballast is outPANNY does not sell ballastUltrasave Lighting (the OEM in Canada for the ballast) will not sell retailYou are screwed if you buy this )(#_#(_#@( unitFinally we sourced $55 similar ballast (2 x 18 CFL bulbs, etc.) from Platt Electric ... nice people willing to spend time on the phone to rescue you ... that plus $75 to handyman/electrician to graft wires to to place ballast inside the unitPanasonic .. SHAME ON YOU!!! Love your phone, not much else these days!"
2,Too much extra stuff,"The product description doesn't say that it also has vitamins D,K, B12, as well as copper, zinc, magnesium, calcium, & manganese. I didn't want these other things as I get them from my other supplements."
3,USED BOOK,"sOME OF THE PAGES WERE LOOSE AND THIS WAS NOT STATED, BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING IT WAS OK.THE BOOK IS VERY GOOD."
1,Customer Review,"Three weeks ago I requested to return the shoe and get a size larger. No response has been received. I requested express deliver, and they didn't arrive on time. Looks like I just purchased $40 shoes that can't be worn. Really poor customer service."
3,"Starts well, goes off track","This mystery has an interesting scientific premise: a medication is killing bacteria that enable the brain to remember. The characters start having memory lapses, blanks in their recollections of conversations and other events, including deaths that may be murders. The premise could have been developed as a science fiction idea with vast implications. Unfortunately, the novel evolves into an increasingly conventional detective story, and the memory loss issue fades until it seems like an afterthought. This may be a case in which mixing two genres in one book did not work."
1,Writing Plague,The science was credible enough to sustain the story. The writing wasn't. Ham-handed exposition and dialogue that belies a tin ear for conversation are just two of the things that made this a weary-making slog.
5,What a pleasure to read at the end of a long day!,"I tend to work long, long hours in the software industry. I can be hard on books. I like creative and complex stories. I get that with some books but they don't really stay with me during the day. There isn't this anticipation about getting through the daily routine to see what happens in the next chapter. Not so with this book. It was an absolute pleasure to have ""The Consciousness Plague"" to read at the end of the day. I found myself thinking of the mysteries and nature of memory throughout the day. It is smart, compelling and a bit scary. Once again, Levinson blends mystery and science fiction beautifully. While I would not wait to go on vacation to read ""The Consciousness Plague"", it is the perfect book to read on the beaches of Cape Cod or on a quiet summer night listening to cricket song."
1,by the numbers,"In addition to his seeming clumsiness with words, this ismodern science fiction by a white, middle aged writer whois now using the standard template of comtemporary SF by PCscience fiction writers. As Sawyer did, in his travesty 'hominoids', these aging white writers seem to be transfixed with inter-racial sex between a black maleand a very young white woman, and let the story wander all overthe place, with dead dialogue, idiotic plots - somehow hoping,perhaps, that the Mandingo Sex in the book will save it.Big Clue: - it doesn't. Just as in Sawyers most recent still-birth, this book just sucks outright and even the sex can't save it. No sense of wonder, no sense of awe, nothing. Now youknow why Arthur C. Clarke and Asimov and Reynolds did not have to stoop to the shuck and jive sex routines - they didn't need them -they wrote the poetry of the future. Levinson, if youneed a sexual fantasy - please, please keep it private."
5,Great read,"Fills in the gaps if you ""missed"" any of the books in this specific tale. Follow the players from youth to middle age and learn the stories of their children."
3,"5 stars for plot, character and dresses, 1 for repetitive ruminations","Ever notice how publishers stop editing popular prolific authors? For shame, treating mzb this way. To be fair, I read this trilogy twice before I noticed how many pages I skimmed, because Marguerida is fascinating, Lew is so happily and deeply resurrected, and Mikail the best of all possible princes. Backstory and plot are sublime, and Marguerida's sensory rediscovery of Darkover is some of the best sensual writing since the Shattered Chain books, and far beyond Darkover, for that matter. I recommend these, but don't hesitate to skip the characters' reveries. You will hear it all again."
3,It was okay.,I think all books are good but can be better. This one I think is better but could be worse.
3,Motorolla V-3,"This item came to me in good shape and in working order. It had T-Mobile written on the item, so I assume this was once a T-Mobile sold devise. This item was not described this way in hte description. The phone is light and relatively easy to use, but lacks features found in some other versions of the V-3."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this phone after lots of rave reviews. However I was in for a great disappointment. The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast. I can hardly go by a day without recharging the phone.I addition the phone automatically reboots itself and there seems to be a delay in my opening the phone and it being ready for a phone call.Overall I am very disappointed."
3,"phone restarts when receiving, reading, or deleting certain text messages","I just got this version of Razr V3 (a myfaves model) as a replacement for an older silver V3. This phone restarts (reboots) when it is receiving, reading, or deleting certain text messages. Motorola and T-Mobile cannot figure out why. This is my second pearl gray of this model, both exhibited the same problem. I am receiving a third from T-Mobile soon, hopefully that one will work."
2,Nothing special.,"This is the only Thom book I've read, so I can't say if his others are better.The characters were never filled out, just killed off occasionally to move the story forward in time. In addition, the author tells the same story that we've seen and read a thousand times before: white people horrible, Native Americans all beautiful, decent, and spiritual. That narrative is crowded with much better stories than this novel. Try Dances with Wolves or Little Big Man, instead.Overall, there was nothing special or awful about this mediocre novel."
1,Disappointing,"After Panther in the Sky and Follow the River, this book is definitely not one of Thom's best efforts. He is much to preoccupied with the subject of female genital mutilation and how it excites the Welsh occupiers of the land. It did very little for me It gets very boorish. The only good thing that I derived from this book was an interest in George Catlin, the gentleman who painted hundreds of Indians so people all over the world would be educated about the American Indian. His life was far more interesting than this book. Shame on you Thom. You could do so much better"
2,I was rather disapointed,"I am a great fan of Mr. Thom's work. I typically scour the shelves for his books. However I found this one below his usual standards. I did not get the impression his research was as thorough this time. Towards the end, the story dragged. I found myself finishing the book merely to bring it to closure. I still highly recommend Mr. Thom's other works to friends. But this book will definitely not be on the by-name list."
3,The Children of First Man,"I enjoyed the book but didn't like it as much as other books I've read by James Alexander Thom. It was interesting but I found it depressing. I didn't have the feeling ""I've got to save this book so I can read it again sometime"" nor did I have an urge to recommend it to anyone. Yet it was well written and held my interest all the way through."
2,SHOP ELSEWHERE!!!!,I HATE Amazon. I have ordered approx 6 items from them directly and 4 of them have been wrong or the orders canceled altogether.
4,This box can really lighten your load,"I bought this to lighten up what I already had. It dropped almost 50 lbs off of what I was lifting. That means when I get in a bind with no help, which happens more often than you would like, I can handle it comfortably by myself. It is strong and has lifetime warranty. I am very happy."
2,Doesn't quite cover the ground,"The ""Dance Fever"" collection doesn't quite cover the ground of the 18 track Rhino collection ""This Is Where the Happy People Go"", which is a much better overview from a group that did disco long before it became a dirty word. Strangely the ""Dance Fever"" compilation starts off with several Thom Bell/Lind Creed smooth soul classics which sounds like they've been recorded not that long ago, and - as far I know - have never appeared on any of their ""official"" albums. Nevertheless - this IS the Trammps, but you have to listen really closely to the soundsamples presented here to recognize Harold & Stanley Wade and Robert Upchurch. Original member Jimmy Ellis was replaced by Jimmy Williams in the mid 80s."
2,This is the old version,Buyers beware that the picture of the book shown is not the actual book that's for sale. If you click on the picture then you will see the actual book which was published in 1996 and not the 2002 version which is shown in the picture. The date is posted in the product details section but if your like me and just look at the picture you will be very disappointed. I've heard nothing but good things about the 2002 version but this version seems out of date and the illustrations are not as good. Hope this helps someone avoid making the same mistake I did. The newer version is worth spending the extra 5-10 bucks on.
5,Very necessary if you're a beginner drywaller.,"I had never even watched any drywalling before I plunged headlong into remodeling a room in my home. I read through this book, went by Mr. Ferguson's step-by-step advice, and ended up with a job that I am quite proud of. My only regret is that I chose not to texture. I painted the finished walls with a semi-gloss paint, and if the light is right, you can see some of my sanding marks. This year I removed a door and patched the hole with drywall. His instructions were invaluable, and yes, I textured this time. It looks great. Thank you Mr. Ferguson!"
1,is this guy ever done drywall??,This is a terrible book. It is loaded with bad techniques and misinformation. It's pages of pages of garbage. he talks about drywall as if it's an art form. Stay away from this book!!!!
2,Not much of a big deal,Big Dog Little Dog is really not a much of a big deal Really Go Dog Go is much of a big deal
2,Ok but not SO catchy.,"Some of the bright and early board book series are brilliantly catchy and rhythmic, this one is simple and cute but not a real attention grabber. Quite good for showing opposites and new words though."
1,Big Dog/Little Dog,I was disappointed in this book as it was much smaller book than what I thought I was buying
4,We love this story,My kids and I loved this story about two dogs who became good friends but very different in ways. My kids learned a lot from the story which I am very about.The Earth Dog Story
5,My Favorite Book,I am 13 years old and I still love this book! My mom used to read this book to me every night before I went to sleep. Please pass the memories of a favorite childhood book on to your children.
5,Wonderful Childhood memories...,"I bought this book for my wife who remembered having it read to her by her parents when she was a child. The book was exactly like she remembered, except for the fact that now it is in a hard back edition. We even bought an extra copy to give to her parents. They couldn't believe that we found it! Thanks Amazon.com for helping my wife revisit some great childhood memories. Great children's book! Great illustrations! Worth every penny!"
5,Fun book,Love PD Eastman's books and this one is a funny one. My 23 month old loves her bedtime stories and this has been a hit.
3,There are Better Bright and Early Books out there,"The Bright and early book series are very good for 10 month - 2 year old range because they are small, easy to hold, and easier to understand. However there are more interesting books out there. This one is about two dogs named Ted and Fred who go skiing, stay at a hotel, can't sleep (not a good message for babies!) and then switch beds and sleep all day. Instead, I would recommend checking out Go Dogs Go, The Eye Book, Old Hat New Hat, Mr. Brown Can Moo, Elmo Says, and Hand Hand Fingers Thumb."
3,Dr. Suess for Kindle Fire,I was excited to get Dr. Suess books on my Kindle Fire for the grandkids to read.The backlit screen with it's clarity and vivid colors prompted this purchaseI must have missed the fine print that doesn't enlargement of the really tiny words.I will continue purchasing Dr. Suess in hardback book
3,"Great book, but beware... it's a small board book","The book is great, like most Dr. Seuss. But, I somehow didn't notice that I was buying a small board book. So, take note. I was trying to purchase for my 1st grader, and these are more toddler appropriate."
3,"cute story,but...","nice story, my 7year old read it to his 3 yr old sister and both enjoyed it. but a few pages had only text and so in my opinion the book hasn't translated well to a kindle edition."
3,Like Butter!,"Newbeats were mostly Larry Hendley's falsetto and the other guys. They were considered Four Seasons without the great gift of the hit making machine of Bob Guadio. Newbeats had hits, ""Bread and Butter"", a novelty song maybe sure but kids sang it all through the summer of '64. ( listen you can sing it yourself I Like Bread and Butter she likes toast and jam ...oh wait how pure '60's sexual innuendo is THAT!)Newbeats had floating bottom Top 100 hits when the Four Seasons took a 3 month break from their 45 releases. ""Run Baby Run"" was a regional top 10 in many places in '65 and still brings smiles to those in the know.This CD has fine stereo mixes and great pleasures for those who appreciate the finer yelps in life."
4,Awesome Book!!,"This book was super helpful! This year, my friends and I decided to save money for Christmas and make each other presents. This idea turned out to be a challenge. I work at a library, so when we first got this book in, i snatched it up. It had so many good ideas in it! There were ideas for all different ages and I like that the projects had a difficulty rating. The materials were usually easy to find (some were more expensive than others and a few i could not find because i live in a small town without a craft store) and the instructions for the most part were easy to follow. I would definately recommend this book to others. I'm sure my friends will like the presents."
1,It gets a star for cuteness.,"Cute, but $50+ for a toddler bathing suit? If you buy this you're either rich or stupid...or both. It's NOT $50 worth of cute."
2,Mediocre and scatter-shot collection of songs,"This appears to be an attempt by the label to make some extra money by culling cuts from their catalog, pure and simple. The songs on this CD are neither well-suited to the stated theme (just because a song is ""slow"" doesn't make it relaxing; it depends on the melodic structure and emotional content, as well) nor are they even the best songs from the individual artist's CDs. Since many fans of the HOS label probably have many of these CDs already and since there is no new material here, this album is for completists or naive newbies only. As an introduction to what HOS is doing now, it's fine. It's unfocused and contains both good and average music. But if you want a good compilation of relaxing and/or ambient music, there are much better choices out there, e.g. Dreams and Shadows on the Spotted Peccary label."
3,"Works fine, but it's THICK","This gauge measures boost...and it does that well.The tubing is kind of cheap, but does the job. It's hard nylon, so it won't bend much without breaking/folding. It connects to 3.5-4mm vacuum hose with a T-fitting.The gauge seems accurate...I expected 5psi and got 5psi. It is pretty thick, though...meaning deep. I have an Autometer A-pillar gauge, and this will not fit flush in it. Just so you know...Also wish it had some color options. I had thought I could just change bulb colors, but the gauge is sealed. I chose to hook it up with no power for the lighting, but the gauge works."
3,size surprise,"I picked this out as a gift for my daughters' birthday,it is a lovely piece with style and craftsmanship,only much smaller than I pictured it being."
1,Sloppy packing & missing parts!,"Item was delivered looking like it had been repacked by someone who didn't care how it arrived. Worse yet, it was missing one of the end brackets. There doesn't appear to be any recourse short of shipping the whole thing back -- and of course the packing it came in is unusable for that. What a bummer."
1,Correct Cover - Wrong Book!,"Received book and was looking forward to giving it to my son for Christmas because he follows John Woodens work. To our suprise when he opened this gift on Christmas, he opened the Book saw the Wooden cover and then opened it to find out the book was some Dale Waltrip Nascar book. It had nothing to do with the outer Cover ""Coach Wooden"" - disappointed :-( They should definetly send us the correct book or credit us back our money."
5,Coach Wooden One on One,"Even if you have no interest in basketball, this book will be inspirational for all."
3,50-50 Book...,"I would give the book 5 stars for John Wooden if it was just about him and his thoughts, but I would give it 0 stars for John Carty. I just read the Wooden pages after about the 1st 10 pages. This was Carty's platform to throw GOD at you using Wooden to suck you in to reading the book. If I want a GOD book, I will buy one!!!"
2,The concept was good,"Poorly written, in my opinion, but one might well argue that children like the repetition. I would rather have my money back, but will pass it on to the grandchildren anyway. They will tell me how good it is, and I'll retract if they really like it."
3,GE Under Counter CD Clock Radio w/light,"I had purchased this item from Ebay. It worked fine until one day out of the blue the CD would not work. We could not get it to work no matter what we did. Awhile after that the light burned out and could not be fixed. We threw it away.It has since been replaced also from Ebay the same except it did not have the CD player. This one is okay except sometimes the stations do not play right. You get a lot of static. When this one goes, never have another GE Under Counter Clock Radio."
1,Bought 2 and both cd players don't work!,Both myself and my friend bought one of these at Best Buy and on both of them the cd players do not work! Unfortunately by time we figured it out (we both thought it was our cd's not the player) we had thrown the boxes and packing away. My friend has since chucked hers in the garbage but I was holding onto mine hoping to find some recall information on the internet. I have not found it as of yet.
1,Radio=Not good Reception CD=Dead on 3 different units,"I've personally owned 2 of these and I bought one for my mother in law....Like others have said the FM antennae is the power cord, so when you have it wrapped up all nice and neat, so your kitchen is not cluttered, you get terrible reception. I live in a suburb of a major metro with many fm and am stations. FM is weak, AM isn't even possible. Static for every AM Station.On all 3 units of mine the CD player has failed. One right way and the other 2 after about 6-12 months. We don't smoke or have pets...it's not near the stove, microwave, sink or dishwasher....Just to make sure there are no questions about interference or contamination ruining CD player.GE=Junk Will never buy again."
3,Nice Fit,This product fits nicely under the cabinet...hardly noticeable. The radio has a quality sound. Don't expect to pick up AM stations out of the immediate area...one of my favorites is about 35 miles away but it has a lot of static. Too bad there is no way of extending the antenna. The directions say to rotate the radio till you get the best reception BUT that is impossible once you secured it to the cabinet. When the radio first arrived the cd player did not work. Amazon sent a new one quickly and had other one picked up. The CD on this one works fine.
2,"Good Radio sound, slim but CD player DOA","I had seen the other reviews but thought I'd get a working one. No such luck. The CD player was dead on arrival. Smooth return process throught Amazon's third party retailer. Its a shame as I thought it was a handsome unit, with radio sound and tuning superior to the previous kitchen under counter radio we had."
1,Could of saved money and aggravation,"I compared prices on a under-the-counter mounting GE radio.Cheapest price was with Amazon.com because of they not charging for shipping. Now that it was ordered thru them, a shipping & handling charge was assessed @ $9.12. Product is delievered not functioning, has to be sent to the manufacture for warranty. Postage is $16.40. Could have bought locally @ Sears for less money & if it didn't work they would of replaced it at that store. Lesson learned!"
1,Don't buy,I am in the process of my 2nd return. The CD player is junk. Our radio worked but am very frustrated- I cannot believe that GE would put ther name on such a piece of trash.
2,Quick install and then the remote did not work,"I installed the 75300 over a countertop microwave and under a cabinet. It was a little tight so I countersunk 1/4"" holes for the 3 raised spacers to make some room. Even so, the CD door just grazes the top of the microwave when it opens. So far so good. I'm getting good FM and AM reception and get low volume but not static on the weather band. I put two AAA batteries in the remote but it doesn't work. A second set of AAA's did not resolve te problem. The front of the unit has printing saying ""remote sensor"". Should a light blink when a working remote sends a command? I intend to take the remote back to Target so see if another unit will work with it, or swap it for a working one."
1,"Nice concept, very poor build quality","It worked for about a year (just until the warranty was expired), then CDs wouldn't play. Now, I can't set the clock anymore, and the time is drifting. All that's left? Radio, which it does still, but I bought it for playing CDs in the kitchen.GE and quality, never the two shall meet."
3,Nice Unit but...,"The radio is nice looking and installed in minutes. It is very easy for the home do-it-yourselfer. The sound is good and acceptable for morning-before-work kitchen use. I.E. news, weather, traffic, what's going on, etc. The radio reception, including the exclusive weather band, does not pick up very well. I was only able to receive with any clarity four FM radio stations and no AM or weather stations. I do live in a major media communication area. Wife is happy with it so it stays."
1,Terrible product! Discontinued with manufacturer- no support!,"I bought this cd player a few years ago and it was a new model at the time. Prior to this model, I bought and exchanged the cd player 2 times before finding one with a working cd player. This one worked initially, but then I started having the same problem as before. The cd player would only work once in awhile. The radio works fine. Yesterday the bulb burned out in the light fixture and I cannot find a replacment bulb anywhere. I am going to search online next because the light is the best part of this! I tried to call product support and was informed that this is a discontinued product and no support is available. Save your money as others have said-- It's simply an old product that never worked properly in the first place."
1,Disappointing product,"This product was purchased primarily for the CD player. It was used a maximum of 30 times and then it quit. The CD would not work despite the whirlling noise of the disc turning. A waste of money.Washington, DC"
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a lubricant that provided a warming sensation. This product did not even come close to any warmth. It felt like just plain lubricant. And as much as I dislike KY-Jelly warming lubricant, KY at least provides some sort of warmth. This product is not what I was expecting and do not recommend it if you're looking for a warming lubricant."
5,Fun and murder in East Texas,"J.R. Weatherford and his grandmother Biggie visit Quincy, Texas to learn what it would take to put together a historical society. Quincy (based on Jefferson, Texas) is obsessed with its history including a colorful ghost. Yet the dead woman J.R. discovers in the fountain outside his hotel room is no ghost. With the Sheriff sick, Biggie is called in to investigate.BIGGIE AND THE QUINCY GHOST is fun. J.R. is the point of view character and author Nancy Bell does a fine job remaining true both to the 12-year-old character telling the story, and to the East Texas setting. Anyone who knows Texans will get a smile (or belly-laugh) from some of the expressions that J.R. uses.Bell provides the reader with a rich serving of Texas history, Texasisms, and a purely enjoyable mystery.Although some of the materials may be inappropriate for children, BIGGIE AND THE QUINCY GHOST is easy to read and a lot of fun."
3,Lacked...,"Character development. This was not one of Roberts' finest efforts. I found the storyline and characters lacking -- there was no reason to care about this novel. For someone of Roberts' ilk, this book seemed rushed and I complete."
3,Okay,I love Nora Roberts books but this is not one of my all time favorites. Characters were okay but the story dragged in a few places.
4,Nice brain candy,This was a nice time waster to disappear into a novel for a while. Nothing too deep and you kinda know where it's going but it was a good read. I would have loved to see more recipes included because they talk a ton about all the food items but very little detail.
3,Cute story,"This writer has been one of my favorites for years, but I am 74 years old and she puts just too much sex in her books. I just skip over it - it doesn't take that much descriptive sex to make a story fulfilling and enjoyable.....and it frustrates the young readers when they worry about if they are being fulfilled enough......"
1,Very Disappointed.....,This was probably Nora Roberts worst novel. I just don't know how I managed to finish reading it. Yawn....very boring !
2,Worst Nora Roberts book,"I'm pretty sure this is the worst Nora Roberts book I've ever read. I was skimming at the end because I just didn't care how it ended. Summer is the most unlikable heroine ever created by Roberts. She's annoying from beginning to end. I'm not sure why Blake even puts up with her terrible, overbearing arrogance. The chemistry between them just wasn't there at all."
4,Classic Nora Roberts' fare,"This is a 1980's book that I recently rediscovered with delight. Classic Nora Roberts, even better than her latest work.... fun and light reading, romantic, unassuming and of course so predictable but so delicious you will want a second helping."
5,Summer Desserts (Great Chefs),"The book had a rich character development. It was an enjoyable read. It also contained a lot of references to cooking and readers could even pick up some knowledge. I ordered the book through Amazon for my Kindle because I have read a lot of Nora Roberts books in the past and enjoy her books, character development and plots. This book did not disappoint."
1,YaaaaaHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!,I was on vacation in a foreign country. The hotel where we were staying had a little reading corner. I cannot believe I gave up a Paul Christopher book for this drivel. How can anyone read this formulaic *******. Nora Roberts has written under so many pseudonyms that anyone with half a brain should be able to figure out why. And why do you hard working people buy her books? Yeck!!!!!!!
3,"Ehh, it's okay, but diety tasting","I'm a big fan of Nature's Way vitamins and I recently had some shakes from USANA/the RESET program so I thought I would give this a try. The first difference is how much this product separates from the water after a short amount of time and that's even when blended in a blender. The other difference was the diety taste. I do not/cannot drink diet soft drinks, but if you're used to that than this will be fine with you. I just don't like that after taste. This sweetener alternative is Stevia which I know is supposed to be better than other but my tastebuds immediately detected it. So I'm trying to finish this stuff up so that I'm not wasting it, but I'm going back to USANA (which I didn't want to join the mailorder only cult) but theirs tastes better with real sweeteners - likely corn syrup- ha! but a better consistency."
5,"Great low calorie, high energy, high fiber drink for weight loss",This is a great product that is mixed with water and only 130 calories. It has 6 grams of fiber -- great for weight loss and hunger control. It has lots of great vitamins to reve you up in your weight loss efforts. I usually have a shake in the morning to get me going along with a energy bar as a mid morning snack. Salad for lunch. A shake before working out or during the p.m. slump. For dinner I eat a healthy dinner. It is a great way to keep a healthy balance while losing weight.
4,reSet,"reSet is good for a quick filling breakfast, that is the only time that I use it. I like the fact that it is high in fiber, that's the main reason I use it, the taste is ok, I've had better. I love the auto-ship option."
4,Great energy product,"I'm 60, I tried Reset to lose weight, to replace meals. The surprise benefit was the extra energy from using it. Always take it after excercising. It has the highest protein (23grams) of all the other protein powders out there."
1,Tastes horrible,This chocolate Reset tastes horrible. It got to the point where I couldn't even stomach to drink it and gave it away to a coworker. I prefer Kirkland's chocolate weight loss shakes.
4,Good tasting and filling,"The claims about resetting your metabolism are hogwash, but what this product does do well is fill you up and keep you full on a small amount of calories. It's a pretty effective meal replacement.I've tried both the chocolate and vanilla versions, and I prefer the vanilla in taste. They taste pretty bland if you only mis them with water, so I usually mix the chocolate with milk and the vanilla with orange juice. The vanilla and orange juice combo is downright tasty for a protein drink, and very bearable to drink."
5,Very good and satifying,"I picked this product up from Whole Food and I've mixed with it with a variety of frozen frutis: strawberrys, blueberries, mango, peaches, etc.I give a full filing for a couple hours. I'll eat a small snack before lunch and I have another shake for dinner. It's low in calories, carbs and fat!!! Highly recommend you put it in the blender."
4,very good!!,I bought this because I wanted something that stuck with me all morning and for low calories....It tastes really good and for its claim of being very filling and long lasting...It is totally right on...it does last a long time. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a big jar and not very many servings for the money...something to consider....
2,I don't like them,I got a few flavors and to tell you the truth I don't much like any of them. They are very chalky and don't taste good to me. I like Myloplex much better for a shake after my workouts and will be getting more of that instead. There are better tasting options out there...
5,"Great taste, gets the job done.","After trying several other meal replacement drinks, I found this one through the Amazon reviews. I tried the Chocolate and Vanilla. Vanilla is OK but the Chocolate is a lot better, no aftertaste and it kills my hunger. I am losing weight as long as I don't fall too far off of the wagon and start eating garbage again. It seemed to turn up my Metabolism and I seem more energetic and alert but not hyper.I was drinking the Myoplex. After trying the Reset Chocolate drink, if I go back to the Myoplex, I gag. I recommend the Reset Chocolate !!"
1,Massive gas!,"OMG, the gas! I have never had a supplement produce so much gas. Xylitol may not do this to everyone, but it does to me and some of the other reviewers. I can't take this during the week, I have to work around other people all day.I can't recommend this product."
2,I wanted to like it...,"I carefully read reviews before selecting a health shake... I have never liked any of them, but I wanted to make it work.I tried mixing it with whole milk and a lot of fresh fruit... a lot of frozen fruit... reducing the mix amount... in a blender... with ice...Nothing I did made this drinkable. I couldn't make myself do it, the funky health shake flavor was far too powerful. The only way I could manage any of it was to mix half of a packet with 16oz of milk and 5 shots of espresso... Even then it wasn't anywhere near being good, but I could manage it. The only positive side is in that half of a packet, I did notice it kept me feeling full for many hours. I just wish I could figure out a way to drink it easily."
5,"Delicious, nutritious, and versatile.","I LOVE this shake. I mix it with almond milk, peanut butter, and a banana for a quick meal replacement that fills me up for hours! (and people, nothing is going to make you feel full for for than a few hours, be realistic). It tastes AMAZING, but not with water-you need to use something creamy. I have lost 20 pounds from DIET AND EXERCISE, but adding this shake has made it easier to not pig out. It gives me the fill and energy I need for my day.Let me clarify something for people who are under the impression drinking a shake MAKES you lose weight-the shake is so you do not overeat and have a quick, nutritionally dense meal. You can't drink this or any other shake and magically lose weight just from adding it to your diet. This is one of the best shakes around in my humble opinion, but the amount of people who think weight loss shakes magically burn calories for you is astounding."
3,Taste isnt bad.,"I read enough reviews about the taste to make me nervous. I've tasted natural low Cal/no cal sweeteners. Stevia tastes so bad in coffee, I just stopped trying. I drink my coffee without sweeteners now. Any way. I decided I would give it a try. Just had the first one so I can't say anything about how well it controls hunger, but the taste is fine. Not wowed, but pretty good concerning I made it with water. (There is the option to use milk) I wouldn't let the taste scare you off. It's not bad, and if it works then it's well worth it. To be fair I will post in a week to review how well it does in other aspects."
5,Great Product!,"I have tried a number of different meal replacement & protein shakes & this one is one of my favorites! Strawberry & vanilla are both good...never tried the chocolate as I'm not a fan of chocolate shakes. I use light vanilla soy milk to mix (less sugar & calories than plain) & 1 shake takes me almost to lunch. No jitters, great profile, & it mixes easily. Love this!"
5,great product-Amazon needs to offer vanilla and company needs to offer better packaging,"I have been using this product for two weeks and have lost weight and I feel great. I wish Amazon carried the vanilla flavor which I like the best. I mix one scoop with nonfat Lactaid and three ice cubes and get a thick and satisfying shake. The company who makes the product should sell an environmentally friendly package. I would pour into one of the plastic containers and keep scooping from that. It is terrible to waste a container half filled with product. It's a terrific meal replacement and the company needs to get with the program with how they package and please Amazon, offer the vanilla! I add fruit for the morning shake and vanilla lends itself to that the best. A plain shake for lunch and a sensible, low carb dinner and I'm dropping pounds without feeling hungry and without having to obsess over what I am going to eat. Terrific product!"
4,pretty decent,"received this product yesterday, tried it blended with water and 2 cubes of ice....it was thick and not too tasty. Second day decided to use skim milk and shake not blend with 2 ice cubes...wow much better!!! I notice I have been using the bathroom more than ususal, and I am a little gassy. Definetly takes away your apetite for at least 4 hours, and when I did eat..I did not eat as much. Will continue to use product..too soon to know about the weight loss."
5,Chocolate shakes to die for!,"I love this product! When I want something sweet at night, this is a great way to get my chocolate fix without doing serious damage to my waistline. I would recommend always mixing it in a blender or Vitamix, because you get a rich, frothy consistency. I tried just shaking the the product or stirring it with a spoon/fork and the consistency was lumpy and not smooth at all. Regardless, the taste was still very pleasant. Good product."
5,"Good taste, losing weight","I bought the powder in the strawberry flavor, and I have been blending it with 1/2 cup of unflavored coconut milk, a big handful of ice cubes, and a small handful of blueberries.It makes a super rich, creamy shake, and I feel like I'm cheating on my diet. I take my shake after my morning swim, and I'm not hungry til several hours after lunchtime. Sometimes I use ""lunchtime"" as snacktime, and just have an apple, or a boiled egg. I've lost 3-4 pounds a week, and am getting back to my pre-college weight!I'm going to buy it in chocolate, next time!"
3,NOT WITH WATER!!!,"3/4/12OMG IT TASTS SO BAD WHEN MIXED WITH WATER!!!!! i use vanilla alomond milk and its like night and day as far as taste gose. the first time i made it with just water and i gaged, a friend sugjested trying it with almond milk and they were sooo right. as far as fealing full it takes some getingg used to the first day i wanted to gnaw my arm off, but if you have an apple or something like that with it you dont feal hungery for like 2-3 hours and another light snack takes care of it. will add to revew after 1 month for weight loss"
1,DOES NOT WORK AND TASTES HORRIBLE,I gritted my teeth while we tried this. It made my wife and I gag over the taste.We endured two bottles of this stuff and finally gave up. It simple does not work.I looked later at the claims and comments and realize that they are not real.
2,Pretty disgusting.,"The chocolate flavor, at least, is pretty disgusting. The powder is extremely clumpy at first but does eventually blend fairly well. I tried this shake with 1% milk, and I can't even imagine how bad it would be with water. The texture is extremely grainy even once blended, so that it tastes like you are swallowing a bunch of sawdust particles with each sip.When it first hit my mouth I thought it was okay or even potentially good, but then I experienced the terrible aftertaste, which I assume is from the stevia sweetening. It is quite sickening. I have a pretty good tolerance with nutritional shakes and I was unable to finish this one on two separate attempts.As for hunger fighting, I didn't notice it working any better than other shakes.Gross."
1,this thing is junk & a wate of money!!!,recvd the product timely but did not find that it did what it was suppose to do..did not found that it curbed my appetite at all!!! save your money!!
4,Definitely Fills,"The fiber will definitely fill you up! It is very thick when made according to directions. I had to use a blender. I was overly full to the point of being uncomfortable the first time I drank it, so I added more almond milk and it was easier to drink. It has a very good vanilla flavor. Just wish there was more protein."
3,If you are sensitive to Sugar Free products...WATCH OUT,"I bought this product about a week and half ago. Was looking forward to trying this to get rid of some weight. I replaced two meals a day with this. I mixed this with unsweented almond milk and ice. It blended up nicely in my Ninja blender. The taste was okay, not great but not nasty. I was full for about 3-4 hours and that was great. Now the bad part...I had the worst gas with this shake. If you have ever tried a sugar free candy and had too much, well it acts like a laxative. I was in the bathroom a lot and the gas was so gross. I thought well maybe my body will get use to it. I couldn't do it anymore after a week. Maybe if I didn't have a job or life I could just lock myself in the bathroom all day, but not when you have a job and share a bathroom. I'm giving this 3 stars because it did keep me full and it didn't taste that bad."
3,I'll keep trying,"I bought this as a way to try to control my hunger and have been having one shake around lunchtime. The first time I made one, it did taste nasty. The second time, I mixed more powder with the water and it tasted much better. I bought one of the blender bottles here on amazon with the mixer ball in it and when I put the powder in there, add the water and some crushed ice, shake hard, it does blend up fine. First few times it did control the appetite then it didn't. I'll keep trying with it though. I did buy another jar of this. I was able to pour one into the other and made for one full jar and will try again this week. I am drinking the chocolate and would like to try the strawberry next."
3,If you are susceptible to gas...,Something in this product gives me uncomfortable gas. It is the only weight loss shake I've tried that does. And that's only serving a day. I'm sure it's fine for those who aren't affected this way.
3,meal replacement drink,"This is a great meal replacement drink. I felt full for 4 hours, but I saw no other results.The taste is similar to other diet drinks, but it doesnt contain asparteme or sucralose - thatis exactly what I was looking for. I just wish it lasted longer than 2 weeks for the cost."
4,i might say this reset shake taste good but the 1st 2 days made me use the bathroom,the shake is good it made me have to use the bathroom for 2 days but after that i was fine i like the drinks but only last about only 2 weeks than u have to order it again i wouldnt mind taking the shake cause i loss 10 lbs already and ready to loss another 25 more lbs the drink does work and i do see a diffence ever people at work see affects and wanted to know what i was doing and i dont really get hugury during the day am going to keep using this intil i get to my goal weight i love this shake and i hope people will at lease try it and see a diffences in there lifes....
5,metabolic reset,delicious protein drink. would highly recommend. The only think I would change is the packaging. The container is about twice the size of the ingredients inside.
3,Thought it would be better.,"I received this item yesterday and thought it would taste great (like the one from vitaminworld) but to my dismay, it had a HORRIBLE aftertaste, tasted like artificial sweetener all the way. I regret buying two of them. I hope I can return them, they will be sitting on my shelf for a VERY long time. :( I would not recommend it."
2,upset tummy,"As most of us I wanted a little help shedding some extra pounds after the holidays. I thought I would try this product. It tasted good, filled me up did what it was suppost to do. But after 5 hours I had horrible bloating, disgusting gas and felt horrible. I think this special extra fiber that they have trademarked was too much for me and my digestion track. I do eat pretty healthy I just eat too much and stay away from foods that upset my tummy, I am not allergic to any types of food. So I know it was not due to drastic change in my diet or a food allergy. After the 3rd day of giving it a try I am throwing away and am going to just get some whey protein powder for my meal replacement smoothie. It is not worth that type of pain and discomfort. I am giving it two stars as it did taste good and filled me up."
1,Quite Useless,"Bought this for my grandson along with Larry Monroe's DVD (Improvisation Jazz Experience). Monroe's is actually useful. I'm not sure what Lovano was trying to say, he basically keeps repeating that one should have a 'personal' approach but offers no real insight on what this means or how to break it down to develop your own approach. Very disappointing, feels like a complete waste."
4,Good romance with twists and turns,"Kiss the Moon was another new author for me. I found the book enjoyable, but nothing that really made me want to stay up all hours reading.Forty-five years ago Frannie Beaudine and Colt Sinclair disappeared while running away together with millions of dollars worth of diamonds. Now while lost in thewoods in New Hampshire Penelope Chestnut discovers the wreckage of their plane.Wyatt Sinclair comes to Cold Spring, NH to put to rest a family scandal and to find out what happened to his uncle all those many years ago. Wyatt and Penelope find that the truth is more complicated that they anticipated, nor did they anticipate the feelings they have for eachother."
4,Weekend warrior mechanic,The fastest and easiest wire stripper I have ever owned. If it was also a wire cutter this would be the perfect tool.

The has been no political correctness by Sony.Another reviewer asked about ""Self Made Maids"" and ""Scrambled Brains."" Both of those shorts are included in Vol. 6."
5,Thank you Sony,"After years of hoping for a full release of all of The Three Stooges shorts...Sony is making that wish come true. The complete shorts from 1934 though the late 1950's.Let hope they release ""Have Rocket Will Travel"" on DVD also.Thank you Sony."
5,THE THREE STOOGES COLLECTION. VOL 8 1955-1959,"To All Stooges viewers, Can someone tell me why the following three shorts have not been produced for DVD? If not, were they just missed!. 1. SCAMBLED BRAINS-1957, 2.SELF-MADE MAIDS 1958, 3.THREE STOOGES SCRAPBOOK, THE SPAIN MUTINY-1963. Cheers!"
