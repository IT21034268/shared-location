4,Great fresh insight for job seekers but getting dated,"As Thomas says in this book there are many reasons why a person would want to live in an area that is alive with opportunity. The attitude is different and half of making a successful career is being in the right place at the right time. This book demonstrates which areas will be better over the next 30 years. Honestly, I logged on to see if this book had been updated since statistics get pretty old in 5 years"
4,(4.5 stars) We're talking about the Pixies!!!!,"Diehard fans probably own the b-sides already but for those who only bought the studio albums this is, in short, a definite must-have! People tend to associate the word ""b-side"" to a second-rate song but given that these are the Pixies' b sides we're handling a collection of great songs in their own right, hovering miles above most of what you hear everyday. (in fact several numbers are just as good as their old days' singles). Whatelse can I say? the Pixies were the greatest band of the '80s (ok, among the greatest...) and this release, while not as great as, say, unsurpassable Doolittle, provides futher evidence..."
4,Nuts 'n' bolts,"Lots of great Pixies songs, although many of them, as live versions or instrumentals, don't really offer anything new. Big surprises are ""Manta Ray,"" which is just as good as the best/weirdest Frank Black/Kim Deal vocals out there, while ""Do The Manta Ray"" is something that comes out of the mind of David Lynch, as is the Eraserhead song ""In Heaven (Lady In The Radiator)."" I've heard the chilled out ""Wave of Mutilation (UK Surf)"" mix on the soundtrack for ""Pump Up The Volume,"" not a great movie but it had a fantastic soundtrack. Kim Deal singing ""Into The White"" is a bit different, but not exactly fantastic. ""Winterlong"" is a nice Neil Young cover, sung by Kim Deal, and David Lovering's tribute to Debbie Gibson ""Make Believe"" makes you glad that he didn't sing on more songs."
3,"A few gems, but hard to take as a whole","I picked this one up to round out my Pixies/Frank Black collection, and though it IS the Pixies, it's also a B-sides compilation. There are some interesting covers, and I like the mellow ""Wave of Mutilation"". Most of the rest of the songs... I can understand why they were left off the superb albums. I have difficulty listening to this one straight through. This disc is for the hard-core fan only!"
3,should've been better,"not as good as one might reasonably hope. this cd only stayed in my collection for about a month or so, then i sold it off. i mean, jeez, when you have the actual albums--brilliant and energizing as they are--why listen to the awkward throwaways?"
3,Pistols 'n Petticoats,"Had to dig deep to find this TV Western Comedy Classic-Glad to have it among my collection.Stars the talents veteran actors and actresses;(the late; Ann Sheridan,Ruth McDevitt,Douglas Fowler and Gary Vinton)Gary Vinton also starred on McHale's Navy,before starring in Pistols 'n Petticoats.Kinda Wonder,had the show's lead star(the late Ann Sheridan) had not died suddenly toward the end of that first season-whether the show would've continued?"
3,fun premise with lots of action but little execution,I was more than a little disappointed with this novel. The premise is exciting and intiguing but the execution is fairly pedestrian and not the most inspired. Suprisinly for a Philip Jose Farmer novel there isn't any sex. The ending left me unsatisfied. Was he setting us up for a sequel he never got around to writing? Nothing really pays off. The enviornmental theme is underdeveloped. The characters don't change or grow or reveal any nuance. And the action and battles quickly become mechanical and wear the reader down.
2,Just OK -- just barely,"But it's a very early Cheryl St. John, and HEAVEN CAN WAIT lacks her later novels' deft touch and lighter handling of plot and character. The cover art is lovely, but what's inside the cover drags and hits melodramatic high notes by the end (the obsessive pyromaniac sister-in-law; the heroine's running away from the hero, without hearing his side of the story...) It's a little heavy on typical standard 'Harlequin' plot turns, which Ms. St. John was later able to avoid in her stories. I don't recommend it. It's not a totally bad book, but it's just not very good."
1,Terrible,"I'm in the middle of trying to complete Linear Algebra right now, with Liebler's book. I've never met Dr. Liebler, but all I can say is that his book makes no sense. I don't really have much of a teacher who likes to ""explain"" things, but rather have you figure them out on your own. And that way is fine and everything, but I seriously do not understand one thing this book is trying to convey. The use of notation and the terms are horrendous. I have never ever had such a difficult time understanding a math book (I'm a math major). I've done well in both my Calculus courses, and have been able to teach myself many applications of math, but this Linear Algebra book is TERRIBLE. If you have ANY choice whatsoever, take a course that uses a different book--you'll be very grateful."
3,DO NOT DROP IT!,"Can't blame anyone but myself I guess. This stone does indeed put out thousands of tiny micro bubbles, but I dropped it on the floor and it snapped in half. Now I'm staring at the tiny bubbles in my wine to drown out the sorrows of my broken air stone. Boo Hoo."
3,a mere foolishness,"This book is a European-centered narrative artifact written in some previous century, of a pre- contact people in first contact situation.It is fair to tell that tale:however,the history of the art and spirit that informs it is not the focus of the book. 'Maori Tattooing' visually presents collections of dessicated tattooed heads from western museums.The photos are dreadfully reproduced,jarringly unlike the striking graphic art on the cover, which you will notice depicts a living being.Appropriating that style there are several small,rather pale copies of what were likely well executed pen and ink sketches, and here is where the book redeems itself.If you pay close attention and do some creative visualization, while you sketch the relation of space and line the essence of the art emerges.If you are an artist you will be tested to 'dig deep' to find a spiritual space to start your design process,but mama, that's where the fun is."
5,Totally satisfied.,"Received the tablet a few weeks ago and immediately started playing around with it. It definitely takes a little time to get used to the feel, but I know that with a little more practice it will be as easy as drawing with a pencil and paper. The software that was packaged with the tablet is also a good way to get started. It amazes me how accurately the software can mimic traditional media.The functionality of the tablet goes beyond simply creating artwork. I don't even use my mouse anymore--I use the pen tool and tablet for everything. If you've been thinking about getting a tablet, I would say this one is definitely worth the money."
2,lasted less than a year,"I was happy with my new Graphire3 at first, it worked great but less than a year later the pen began skipping and halting and the tablet became useless to me at that point. I've had to revert back to my smaller, original, Graphire."
4,Excellent ending,"Pretty much the same review I gave for the first DVD, with the exception that it ended pretty well. Lots of action. Really BIG battles over vast spaces."
1,Not worth it,"The pole arrived broken. The telescoping didn't lock, and there's no way to fix it. That's what I get for buying cheap."
2,Cheap Plastic parts,"After 6 hikes, the plastic thread that expands/reduces the length of the pole became loose and the pole became useless."
5,Swiss gear Hiking Pole,Have several. One in each car and the trucks. Work great and I can pack in suit cast when traveling.
3,Quality control problem,"I bought two hiking poles, which includes a tiny compass each but one them points 180 degrees of the other (ie one points to the South instead North).On the other hand I am totally dissatisfied of the way EACH pole was packed in a HUGE BOX. Finally I paid a lot for shipping air and two small poles.For international purchase that's inefficient. Please review this issue"
1,One of the worst...0 out 5,"I have bought 4 of these and believe it is a manufacturer defect. Out of the 4 poles, only 1 of these will tighten correctly. The rest collapse even without any resistance at all.I'm not going to comment on the comfort or other features. Basic functionality is simply not there.I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Amazon requires at least 1 though."
2,There's better products out there.,"This is a reasonably priced trekking pole that's lightweight and fairly sturdy. However, the first time I used it, the carbide tip fell out. I saw some of these at Wal-Mart and examined the tips. Quite a few of them had already fallen out prior to even being purchased. I even tried gluing mine into the staff, but it fell out again during the first use. I threw away the tip and made my own with a nail. So even though this is a well-made pole (except for the crappy tip), I don't recommend it (due to the crappy tip!). Instead, get a Kaito pole. I got one for Christmas and it's awesome. Light-weight, well built, sturdy, the tip hasn't fallen out yet(!), and it has extra features (camera screw-mount, compass, thermometer). The Kaito's are only a little more in price than this Swiss Gear. They are worth the extra cost."
5,Excellent for Bush Whacking,"My primary use for this was to give me something to help me stay upright during geocaching, and to have something for bushwhacking. If you are into Geocaching you will understand! [...]After falling down the side of a hill and getting a bit scratched up, getting this Hiking Pole has worked very well to keep me balanced in weird places. Also, it's handy for moving branches out of the way (i.e. bushwhacking) when necessary!"
3,a little shakey,"I bought this for the rubber tip! However, it seems difficult to change the length and keep it screwed firmly-it moves when you lean on it. Maybe it's a defect?Swiss Gear Hiking Pole"
4,The Case of the Disappearing Tips,"I bought my set of SwissGear Hiking Poles at WalMart for $18.88. My main objective was to get back to walking for exercise with my friend who purchased her poles for $80. plus. Hers are fancier, but mine work just as well EXCEPT for the fact that after only 3 weeks' use, the TIPS are already down to the metal, and clink when I walk on the walkway. Hers show little wear. I NEED NEW TIPS!!! (Walmart doesn't have them) HELP!!!Other than that, I love 'em!76 year-old Gramma Ann"
4,Value for money,This is my first hiking pole. I am very happy with the quality and functionality. I have been using this product for more than a month now. It provides the necessary support when hiking. The end cap has so far held on. Value for money!
4,Acceptable trekking poles,"The poles were as described. They are sturdy, easy to adjust and lightweight. They are a good starter pair. They do not have all the bells and whistles of Leki but are good as a start for me and my wife."
5,Worth It.,"I bought to use when I run with my snowshoes instead of lugging around my ski poles. They are compact, sturdy, and cheap. Much better than paying $65+ for Atlas poles at a local ski shop."
1,el cheapo crappo grande,Bought 'em at Wal-mart for cheap. Brush guard fell off inside of 100 meters - pole lock broke and collapsed in less than 2 miles. Save yourself the hassle and invest in something more substantial - ya get what ya pay for.
2,Hiking pole review,I ordered 3 hiking poles they came in separate large boxes wasting resources. Two poles were in good shape and came in damaged boxes. The third pole was in an undamaged box but pole doesn't work as well as the other two. The protecting tip was missing and one of the tightening clutches spins and never locks down securely.
1,Swiss Gear Breakdown,"I recently saw that the Swiss Gear hiking poles were sold at WalMart for a very reasonable price under $20.Stopped by to see one, that was even in blue to match our mountain bikes.As I fiddled with the extension and shock absorbing feature, I put some downward pressure on the handle.You guessed it, the pole snapped off at the lower adjuster. Completely broke in half! So, I'm back looking at Black Diamond with their flick lock and lifetime guarantee, albeit for $70-$90.But, I can't imagine one of these Swiss Gear's breaking while coming down a trail with too much pressure. Look out below and call the ambulance!I did report the breakdown to a WalMart clerk."
5,bargain hiking poles,"I've been an avid hiker/backpacker for 25 years and was skeptical about the benefits of using hiking poles. I decided to try these very inexpensive poles before investing in a high-end set. Using two, I am simply amazed at the increased endurance going uphill, and the decrease in knee pain going downhill. They are great for crossing streams, and can be used to pitch a tarp. As for these particular poles, after about 40 miles of use in varied terrain, they appear to be very durable; I now see no need to ""invest"" in an expensive set."
3,Will not connect to standard desktop monitor like acer x223w,This is a good heavy duty cable but if you are getting it to connect to an standard monitor be sure and check your dvi connector because it will not fit any of the five monitors that I have. I have 5 monitors at the house all standard from acer to westinghouse and none of them have a dvi connector that will fit this cable. if there had been a picture of the cable ends or the diagram of it I would have realized the problem because I have had it before. So please save yourself aggravation and be sure this is the correct cable before you order it.
5,REQUIRED READING FOR ALL COMPUTER CONSULTANTS!,"One of the problem with this industry is that they do not prepare programmers for the realities of business. This book is an eye opening review of the considerations that must be considered when programmers must work the business side of what they do.Although there is a lot of attention paid to intellectual property law, there is a lot of good information for the consultant to read. The rest of the book is about agreements and contracts, which every contractor needs. With the samples on the CD, it provides solid guidelines on the business of programming!If you are a consultant, especially an independent consultant, they why don't you have a copy of this book??"
1,Never Again,After hours of thrift shopping I found myself buying the Dazzle DV creator 150. Accourding to specs best product for the money...WRONG. Not only did I waste my time I have wasted $160.oo.... Not only did the program get the last laugh on me the piece of equipment that came with it is better off being threw in the trash then wasting any more of my time. To all that is in anyway interested in this product turn away or forever wish you never bought this product. If you buy from most electronic stores the policy states you can not return such items only replace with same. [...]
1,It is useless...,"I am not sure what's worse. Wasting DVDs trying to make a movie or the time wasted. Studio 8 that comes with this video capture device crashes randomly. After capturing 4-5 minutes of video, it stops capturing and will not capture anything until I have to physically unplug and replug the USB cable. I have not been able to (not once) capture anything greater than a 4 minute clip and I have a 2.8 Ghz HyperThreaded PC with 1 GB of memory.I will be returning it first thing in the morning."
1,Rename it??,"I bought a ""Dazzle Digital Video Creator 150 Hi Speed"". I had heard high reviews about it's performance, supported by Pinnacle software, so I bought one.Dazzle is now owned by Pinnacle. They've turned this unit to junk. Now they are trying to rename this unit and sell it as a ""PINNACLE S DAZZLE DVC 150 VIDCAP-USB 2.0 EDIT SOL""?I've been in contact with their tech support over my issues and they are either not willing to divuldge any information or really have no idea what they're doing. I've isolated the problem with my system to a single file and all they tell me to do is uninstall/reinstall. Recently, they have only inquired about my recent findings.Unless you have the knowledge to create registry switches to use this, as I have done, proceed with caution. Don't rely on any advanced tech support."
4,good for me,"I bought this a year or two ago. I have burned about 70 dvds from video captured with it. Pinnacle Studio QuickStart 9 came with it. Occasionally, I'll get a DVD that has the sound off a little bit. Mostly I have to keep the hard drive defragmented well to keep that to a minimum. Rerendering and reburning usually works. I don't usually have to recapture anything. I haven't had any major problems like the rest of the people here. With DVDs only 30-50 cents, it's ok to make a coaster every now and again. I am running a PC about 2 or 3 years old with Windows XP Home edition."
1,In a word - Useless,"I bought this product for my work and have never been so embarrassed. It does not work. I can't get it to capture any audio. I tried the online manual, help desk, etc. There is no help for the issue I am having. The software that it came bundled with installs a bunch of ""options"" that you can the pay to have ""unlocked"". So, basically you get a product that can't capture your video correctly sending information to the software that you have to pay even more to get to work. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible! They might as well advertise that it allows you to travel through time because you can spend days trying to get it to work, and still not be any further along than when you started."
1,Video capture disaster,"I don't know how well the hardware works, because the Pinnacle Studio 9.3 software bundled with the device is a buggy piece of garbage. It won't run at all on one of my systems, and crashes regularly on the other. In the six months I've owned the thing, I've been able to successfully capture about eight minutes of video."
1,A bad way to spend $120,"For the past day I've been trying to use, with no success, my new Dazzle 150 to capture video. Their technical support consists of a web site that suggest the problem can be fixed by downloading new drivers ( that doesn't remady my problem). It appears that Dazzle was bought by another company and I'm left with an expensive bookend."
1,Didn't work,Didn't work onmy new emachine even with new drivers. Can't call for asupport without paying long distance.
2,Video Quality not good,"I purchased this unit to digitize movies captured on a 8mm camcorder. The unit setup easily and captured movies without trouble. The quality of the movie captured over USB was fair. Not nearly as sharp as the original, choppy, and color was not as vivid. Very disapointing. I use P4 1.8 with 700 MB Ram. This is not the unit if your goal is to convert your analog movies to DVD or MPEG. I will try a DVD Recorder and will hopefully get better results."
2,does o.k. job,Has o.k. quality video but you can tell the video has been copied. The computer often did not recodnise this product. Had to plug and unplug several times in order for devise to work.
1,Save your F'n Money,"The DVC150 is completely useless if you are working in a Windows XP format. The hardware will ""Malfunction"" and be ""Unrecognized"" my Windows.Save you time and money. Buy ANYTHING but this piece of junk."
1,Product was only mediocre to begin with. Now - no support,"The product only worked originally after downloading several updated drivers. Even then, the quality was poor. I lost my hard drive recently and am now unable to download the necessary updates through Pinnacle. Pinnacle is unresponsive to email requests for assistance. Will not utilize any products from a company with such lousy support."
3,Very informative,Learned a lot about being filled with the Holy Spirit and doing the will of the Father. I would recommend it to anyone desiring a closer walk with the Lord.
4,A LOT better thaen I expected!,"When first dragged to the theater with my 7-year-old brother, I thought ""Oh, no."" The live-action 101 Dalmations was awful, therefor, this would be awful, right? WRONG! It was a little ""cutesy"", but still fun. I loved the anthropomorhism, meaning the animals weren't really animals, but humans in animals bodies. For example, the bird could actually talk, not just mimic, the dogs knew how to work the VCR, Oddball gave commands using barks, and so on. However, it is dark at times, but the darkness is balanced out with the ""cutesyness"". Enjoy!"
1,102 Dalmations,Really awful! A showcase for Glenn Close and the clothes she wears! No redeeming factors.
4,Kids Will Love It!,"This movie is a typically funny Disney romp, and it's a sure thing that your children will love it. Glenn Close once again does a terrific job of portraying the diabolical Cruella. The addition of the spotless puppy is a cute touch. I couldn't stop my son from saying ""look at the puppy he lost his spots!"" This movie did not so good at the box office, because of competition(ie: The Grinch & Rugrats), but don't let that stop you from seeing it now. 102 Dalmations is a must buy for any Disney Fan! A Solid 4 Stars"
2,Blah....,"My 3 year old said she liked it though lost interest halfway though, its rare that she doesn't finish a movie. Just didn't have the appeal of the 1st live action one and no where close to the original. Only watch if you are a huge fan and can't get enough spots...."
5,Happy Grand children,It was a Christmas present. I had 101 Dalmations and they wanted to see 102. It was a good story and showed that people care about dogs and were willing to give them homes and not death.
2,It seemed like a cheap shadow of the first.,"I was deeply disappointed by the movie, but still entertained. I don't think this was at all a fitting follow up to 101 Dalmatians, but it was still okay. It had it's very high and very low points. There is this parrot in the movie that almost makes it a must see. He is so funny, but the plot is so rambling disconnected that it is almost no fun to watch between the parrot scenes. Some points in the plot I would say is just total cheap duplication, but some points are drastically different and really boarding on good, but it always seemed that as soon as they got close to good they'd jump away. The characters didn't feel intense to me anymore. It seemed like a cheap shadow of the first."
3,A good cute movie,"I liked this movie I thought it was cute, but I also have to admitt that it was not as good as the first one. But most sequals arn't. This was ot bad but it also was not that good of a movie."
5,Glenn Close is a genius!,"The sequel to the wildly successful ""101 Dalmatians"" does not disappoint! The story line is quirky, clever, and features once again, the most talented actress in Hollywood as the demonic Cruella DeVil (Glenn Close). I usually don't enjoy sequels, but this one is different! I enjoyed every moment. Perfect for a family viewing, but enjoyable by adults as well!!"
3,"Cute and worth watching, just don't expect too much","I didn't expect to like this movie, but it turned out to be entertaining and kind of cute, a solid 3 star offering - and it's definitely just right for the kids. Adults will find the plot transparently obvious and standardly Disney-predictable, but then it *is* supposed to be a kids' movie! If nothing else, grownups, get it to watch the usually serious Ioan Gruffudd (Horatio Hornblower and Fantastic Four) play tug-of-war with his dogs and get made fun of by his parrot, who was voiced by the incomparable Eric Idle."
3,Fun to Watch,"Away with the long winded reviews, '102 Dalmatians' is a fun movie, especially for animal lovers. Glenn Close and Gerard Dapardieu are great villians. It seems that Cruella has been cured, so she is released on parole. Her parole officer just happens to be Pongo's owner from the first movie. While checking in with her parole officer, Cruella's brain is knocked back to her old self by the ringing of Big Ben. After this it's a race to make that ""hooded spotted puppy coat."" The animals are wonderful in this movie, but I did find the do gooders in this film rather dull."
4,102 Dalmations,Product received in a timely manner. The DVD was in excellent shape and serves our purposes.
3,little but nice,"The item is really small!!In the photo it look sooo big, that I was a little bit dissapointed at first when I saw it... but after some time... I really like it on my girlfriend. It's a nice gift, and for the price is a good buy!"
4,Almost perfect,"This is a great set of movies which are really fun to watch with the kids, and a great deal. However, for whatever reason the first 4 movies have been squeezed onto one disc (two each side). The one I got stopped playing for a couple of minutes each side. I am returning it in the hope the next one will work smoothly. If I had known four movies were on one disc I may not have bought this set."
4,Know What You're Buying!,"This album isn't really the best of Joe Cocker - it's the best of slick, adult contemporary, 1980s Joe Cocker. That said, it's not without some great songs (""You Can Leave Your Hat On,"" ""Night Calls""). But if you want classic Joe Cocker, try the ""Greatest Hits,"" ""A&M Classics,"" or ""20th Century Masters."""
3,Mixed Bag Anthology,"""The Best of Joe Cocker"" contains the highlights of his career from after the period covered by his ""Greatest Hits"" album, so it must be noted that the version of ""With a Little Help from My Friends"" is newer and not the ""classic"" version. Cocker's later career was not nearly as interesting as his late 60s and early 70s peak. A song like the syrupy duet ballad ""Up Where We Belong"" may have been a massive hit, but it has little in common with the raw power of his best work. The album's best moments come early. The first three songs, ""Unchain My Heart,"" ""You Can Leave Your Hat On"" and ""When the Night Comes,"" may be a bit heavy on the bombast, but they are quite tuneful and Cocker's never been in better voice. After that the songs are less memorable, with few standouts.Overall, an up-and-down anthology from the latter part of Joe Cocker's great career."
2,not Joe's best,"You can't call a compact disc ""The Best of Joe Cocker"" if it doesn't contain ""Feelin' Alright."" Or ""The Letter."""
3,Is not new but is in good condition,Thre points music is good I love cocker this is the best album I recommend to you price is great
5,Do You Feel Sexy With Just Your Hat On,"Joe Cocker at his Best....... Just like the Title says. If you are a huge Joe Cocker fan you will LOVE this album. Play the album & let Joe ""Unchain Your Heart"" because his deep growly soothing sounding Voice will leave you feeling SEXY & wanting to only ""Leave Your Hat On ""....... ""With A Little Help From Your Friends"" & a whole lot of Joe's Music you can rinse those Bad Blues right down the drain & Turn up the Volume to ""Shelter Me"" from the Pain..........."
2,"Where Is ""Love Is Alive?""","I agree this is not up to par with Joe's best stuff from the 60s and early 70s, but given that, they even left off his best song from this period, ""Love Is Alive."" That song really ROCKS and it is not here. Shame."
1,"Muddied, terrible sound","I'm really surprised at these positive reviews. They must be planted. This is not a company known for quality products, especially when it comes to audio. The 1000-watt system sounds extremely muddy and I don't think this is worth even $59."
4,Very Nice System Right Out Of The Box,"Having owned a component system that I've built myself I was hesitant on buying a HTIB system. I was pleasantly surprised when I hooked it up. This system is everything that I had hoped for. Very good sound quality, bass response is excellent, very little tweaking. I had to turn up the center channel a bit from factory setting,(no big deal). HDMI is a plus, upconverting looks awesome, very stylish along with my Samsung TV. The only thing I can think of is that I had trouble playing some of my dvd-r disks and mp3 playback on cd-r is a bit slow reading. Thats why I gave it a 4 star (there is no 4.5). Check the internet, I found this unit cheaper at B&H; audio-Video, awesome retailer, trusted site.Lastly, buy the wireless surround that goes with it, it works flawlessly."
4,Amazing Sound,"I have to say I was a little doubtful about the product - see it to believe it kind of guy - and so far I have been blown away. I was expecting more wires that I had to buy but all was good. I'm upgrading and buying the wireless back speackers connection which is a must if you hate to see wires like me. the setup wasnt as hard as some claim, yes you have to twiek a little but what doesnt need a little tweaking here and there...get the monsters cable, wireless back speakers and you will be all set to enjoy! love it!"
1,Functionality,"I purposely bought this unit as it was one of two on the market with wireless rear speakers. Unfortunately, within a day of plugging it in, I noticed that tell-tale electric smell that says ""something's not happy in the unit"", coming from the disc changer. I hadn't even tried to plug in speakers yet since we had just finished the basement room this was meant for and had been using the HDMI cable to just play through the TV sound. Once the smell had cleared, nothing worked, no video, no sound, no nothing. I have had to pay $26 to send it to New Jersey for repair or replacement so I really can't comment on it's overall quality yet, much less the sound. I'll wait to see whether the replacement or repair is functional or report back on any difficulties this might entail. So, for now, I give this a thumbs down, especially since it has cost me more money and I am unable to use it during this interim."
4,Research,"I did my research and came across this HTIB (Home Theatre in a Box)months ago as well as another comparable system JVC THC6, which you could probably still find at J&R Music & Computer world for the same price $379. After waiting for the price to come down and searching for similiar products and comparing it against the JVC THC, it came down to color preference, lol. The system sounds great, plenty of options to tweak the sound just right, which many can find either annoying or aucustically pleasing. I drop one star because it did not support my ipod with its USB device. Nothing a stereo link from Nyko cant fix, also I hear it gets rave reviews on Amazon and you can buy it at compusa from $14.99. You really cant go wrong with this system if you want it all in one box without the hassle of surfing online for seperate components to build your own custom system: receiver, speakers etc. Time saver and money saver."
5,Complete System is Excellent,"I found this system to perform up to my specifications. I am certainly no audiophile, but feel this system offers me everything I was looking for in viewing and listening to dvds and audio cds. I use this product to handle my audio from Direct-TV. I would recommend this to anyone looking far a good system for an excellent price."
3,"samsung not really a company for speakers,","I love samsung. They make some of the best products out there.. that said... this item is fair rather then stellar. or maybe I just demand more in a home theater system... the speakers are a bit on the weak side and I just to get the experience I expect.. that said it is a home theater in a box so you get what you pay for.. best bet is too by components individually from companies like pioneer that are in the ""sound"" business. then by speakers from someone like JBL.. If you have a high def tv especially, and you definatly want a HTIB you'll prob be getting blu ray or hdtv at some point.so you might as well wait and get a reciever that can play all the audio and blu ray too.... in short.. looks great (though the tall boys are smaller then they look, Id call them mid boys ;) ), sounds about average, better off buying components so your truly satisfied,"
5,funky four plus one conspicuously missing,"enjoy along with lesser known off labels; Grand Groove, Paul Winley, etc. produced the most instrumentally moving, tautly rhymed hiphop (rap in those days) on the east coast. Having the enjoy collection on vinyl im painfully aware of the absence of Kool Kyle, Funky Four Plus One and others. That being said the label is generally well represented with Spoonie G's love rap, Super rappin (7 minutes of Funk instrumental), etc. The label house band, which is responsible for these wonderful instrumentals-Pumpkin and Friends released an enjoy lp by said name. I've been searching for it-should have requested a copy from Bobby Robinson in telephone conversations (circa 80-81)-even passed it up once at Douglas Records in DC-all in hindsight. Nonetheless enjoy!"
3,"Are all ""new"" copies on CD-R?","I just purchased a sealed copy of this disc, and while the inserts appear to be professionally printed, the disc itself is a CD-R. While I don't disagree with the five-star reviews in regard to the music, I am giving this three stars due to the cheap production. Also, one of the main reasons for my purchase was to find a non-vinyl source for ""Rockin' It"" by Fearless Four. Unfortunately, this is yet another disc that has dubbed this song from vinyl. (It is also dubbed from a record on Tommy Boy's Hip Hop Essentials Vol. 1 and Awesome 2 Present The History Of Rap Vol. 1.)"
3,DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The beginning of ""Feel the HeartBeat"" is missing the opening beat the absolute drop of the song and the album art is by some other label(downloaded to i-tunes) that's not good at all,it took me a longtime to find these songs i'm going to keep the disc but i'm not satisfied"
4,"Very nice rug, but expensive.","Why are rugs soooo expensive? It's basically a square piece of cotton. How easy is that to make? Jeans are infinitely more difficult to make, and yet, you can get a cheap pair of jeans for $20! I don't get it......... Wash the rug 3-4 times to wash out the extra dye. Won't fit in your average washing machine. Don't wash in your machine anyway, cause of the dye. Heavy duty, and looks nice. No problems with color transfer."
1,The worst Book on Waterhouse,If you are truly interested in the work of Waterhouse DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. The images are small and poorly reproduced. Check the size of the pages and you will realize what postage stamps the images are.If you are truly interested in the work of Waternouse get Hobson's book. There is very little price difference and it has normal pages sizes which beautifully reproduced photographs of the paintings.The accompanying text is far more illuminating than the drivel printed in this book.Judy Weller
2,Not up to much,"A waste of money especially if you are buying from another currency into american dollars. Buy something normal sized and get better quality reproductions. The book is acutally only about 4inches square - I thought previous reviews by other customers meant it was say a half-size A4, not so small I can put it in my top pocket and lose it!"
5,Waterhouse in minature,I thought this book charming. It is a minature size but is ideal for giving as a gift to a fellow Waterhouse lover. There are a couple of paintings reproduced which aren't in the other Hobson books. Each painting is accompanied by a carefully chosen poetry fragment. I'm not sure why the previous reviewer called such text drivel - I would certainly not call the poetry of Alfred Lord Tennyson drivel!
3,Decent entry level tablet,"This is my first tablet and I think its good for the price relative to other tablets on the market. Wacom is a well-known company for tablets so reliablity and quality is good. The mouse is pretty useless for me since it only works on top of the tablet. The pen takes a lot to while to get used to. Its difficult to be precise because the tablet works through a little space that represents the entire monitor. The sensitivity is difficult to calibrate and also takes time to learn to use. My tablet is so far collecting dust, because I gave up trying to learn it. Ill pick it back up when Im in the mood to draw again."
4,A great Tablet at an affordable price.,"The Graphire3 is quite good as a Tablet, it's only downer is the small 4x5 drawing space, tought you get used to it after a while, it's still a limitation, you actually forget the mouse, must be on the tablet to work.As a begginer on digital painting, this is a God send to me. I can paint as I always wanted, and at an affordable price."
5,Ergonomic mouse replacement,"Unfortunately Amazon has positioned the Graphire as a drawing tool, and as such it's disappointing some folks who should be getting one of Wacom's higher end tablets.What the Graphire is fabulous for is reducing pain caused by traditional mice. I had recurring tendonitis and cysts with both mice and trackballs, but no problems since switching to my first Graphire about 5 years ago. The Wacom requires no shoulder motion, and very little hand or wrist. Clicking is done with an ultra-light stylus, and the thumb is used for a right/double click rocker switch on the side of the stylus. I use it with a 1280x1024 screen at home, and travel with another in my laptop case. Win2K and XP. Works for gaming too."
2,Currently does not work well with Windows XP SP2,"The hardware is good, the drivers are awful. There is a serious bug which renders the tablet useless for a second user in XP SP2. Unless the first user logs out totally, the whole tablet is dead for the second user.This is not the first major driver bug Wacom has allowed to hit its users. (Also worth noting is that when I complained about this to Wacom, they told me to ""calm down."") So if you like to be told that your inconvenience is no big deal, go ahead and spend your money."
2,I tried it and it is ok from an artists point of view,I bought this purposely for drawing. It came and well it was really small like a mouse pad and the area to draw in was really small. It worked for me about 3 months. Since I travel alot with it it was used daily and the USB wires will go if you aren't careful. It won't work now due to the reason of traveling with it. I would suggest this for a home type tablet and not for the artist type out there. For the artist out there..get a bigger one and a different brand.
3,"Not as great as everyone says, but good enough to have!","This is NOT a standout piece of gear that you fall in love with! I use it with my keys. When I got it I tried it in some mastering i was doing and it was a total disaster.Lost all detail. This box warms up the sound, is good for price. Not the love that steals your heart.So buy it but dnn't expect it to change the world. Hint: TC Electronics boxes are to love, and I mean love, you sit in awe of the results."
1,junk,did not get item not good company watch out they ship it out before it comes in they take it back dumb and i waited for about a week
1,Junk,This product is junk and I suggest if you tie up to other boats a lot you avoid. I purcahsed these and within the first year all had broken the plastic connectors.
4,Good.. but diameter is too small for wakeboard tower,"These are easy and quick to put on and remove.However, the diamter of the loop is a bit too small to fit on a wakeboard tower.Our tower diameter is 2"" and these are a really tight fit.Overall, we really like the convenience and quality.With these, anyone can help put bumpers out when docking.. not just those that can tie a knot."
4,Mello techno . . .,"I've had this album for years - it's jazzy, bright and mellow, and I find myself putting it on when I cook or as background music for light conversation. I feel the other reviewer's noting that it's not representative of hard-edged modern techno is absolutely correct, but this is a very pleasant document of a more mellow, jazzy-feeling techno period."
5,a beautiful debut album,"Most people think of Sixpence as a new band, with their hits ""Kiss Me"" and ""There She Goes"" seemingly coming from out of nowhere to being played all over mainstream radio. But the truth is, Sixpence has been around for years. TFATW is their first CD and is a stellar debut. Their earlier stuff is very different from their latest album, but still shines with the ethereal vocals of Leigh Bingham (Nash) and the poetic lyrics of Matt Slocum, who also plays guitar. This album sounds a bit like the Sundays with a hint of 80's-era U2 mixed in. Definitely worth checking out. Also check out their second album, ""This Beautiful Mess""."
5,The best Sixpence Album,"This album may be religious in nature, but it also deals with issues as pain and loss as well as being light and in love. It has the religious undertone and makes you wonder ""Why couldn't we have sung songs as cool as this in church."" The stand out songs are ""Feild of Flowers,"" ""Trust,"" and ""Spotlight."" All of which make you think and feel. And that is what a good album is all about right?"
4,the perfect marriage between ideas and high comedy,the perfect marriage between ideas and high comedy and for those who read anything more to say? I really don't think so
2,tired but legible,"Well, the play is terrific, brilliantly written as one would expect of Tom Stoppard. But the book was something else. The pages seemed dried out and some fell out of the book shortly after opening it."
3,"Close, but no cigar","It was an interesting premise as far as the weaving in and out of time was concerned. What interested me the most was the philosophical musings on the nature of the universe as it relates to the field of mathematics. It was a quick read, but in the end I felt unsatisfied with the plot resolution (lack of) and the character development."
2,Arcadia: A Play with reader's notes,I received this in a timely manner but there are a lot of notes written in ink throughout. I think this should have been mentioned.
2,"""Arcadia"" is a gimmick","""Arcadia"" is a play that bounces back and forth between the early 19th century and the late 20th. A great deal of thought and care obviously went into the logistics of repeated time transformations. I fear, however, that the technical aspects of this endeavor get in the way of this play having any particular point. There are a number of ill-developed characters, none of whom elicit much emotional reaction.""Arcadia"" is sort of a literary parallel to ""Twister"" or ""Jurassic Park"": Lots of focus on the special effects, very little on a plot or character development."
5,Stoppard is PURE BRILLIANCE,"As always, Tom Stoppard has managed to intricately weave a complicated tale that leaves one with not only a score of hilarious one-liners but also some deep questions about the ways of the world. This one is definitely a must read!"
4,An Intelligent Drama,"This play is essentially a love story - no, much more than that, but at bottom, a sad love story between tutor and pupil. Septimus Hodge, whose being become alive on the pages and of course, the lovely, intelligent Thomassina. But that was way back in 1809 or thereabouts. In the future - oh yes, this is also a time travel science fiction play. We also discuss Newton, quantum physics, literary history, Lord Byron. All in but a brief few pages. There is much, much to recommend this dramatic work, although one wonders if unlike most plays it lends itself better to the written page than the stage."
3,Eurocalm Valerian,These capsules work OK but do not give the total effect calmness (at least to me). I think that the effect depends on the person. I do use them and will continue to do so.
5,Creepie Creepie.....,This is a great cartoon for kids...not only is it entertaining but there is a subtle message that the kids can learn from. They learn about bugs...and a lesson in morality. (Again the lessons are subtle) My kids love it and unlike some other programs it makes learning fun.
4,Lots of fun.,"My daughter is 5 and loves the fuse beads. It is fun for her to create pictures and it helps her work on her hand-eye coordination. An adult needs to be around to iron the finished project, but it has been a very worthwhile purchase."
5,It's addictive!,Noel enlightens us with glorious dance music. The sound of it all is like brilliant light that stays in you til you can get to the play button again. Silky vocals of nicole henry are mesmerizing and hypnotic.
2,not good,i don't believe this cd was good at all. now don't get me wrong he is a good trance dj but there was only 2 good tracks to me. he has another good cd that i heard it's called trance (trans): a state of altered conciousness. now that's a good cd.
1,Spring Break Freakfest,"Forget this one.I had thought this was a GGW product but it is not.I think this guy got a video camera for his birthday and took it to a beach full of ""students"" and filmed what he could find. He sure didn't find a hell of a lot. This DVD is not as good as the worst of the GGW ones I have seen.They say you learn from experience and if that is true I should be getting a little smarts in my selections pretty soon."
4,never stop working chef,"being a chef and on your feet all day long those clogs provide me comfort security,good looking and very professional"
4,Easy Off Bicycle Basket,"This is a nice item and very convenient for doing light shopping. I use mine when I'm camping and have to make a quick trip to the camp store. The only problem I ran into was probably more due to my bike's poor design, rather than the basket. When I tried to slide the basket onto my handlebars, there was a large bolt(holds my handlebars onto the bike)in the middle of post and I couldn't put the basket over it. I had to bend the metal frame of the basket and tilt the basket upward to get it to go past the bolt. Hopefully no one else will have this problem, but with the bikes being imported from Huffy of China, it was not a good design for this type of basket."
4,Good quality but needs tweeking,"Great basket, but the arms that go over the handle bars need some tweeking. My handle bars are larger in diameter so I am trying to rebend the arms to fit better."
5,Recommendable,"Fine Velvet Underground tribute album. Well known Velvet songs recorded by excellent bands. This is a summary of three volumes ""Heaven And Hell"". Most I like ""Here She Comes Now"" by Nirvana, ""Sunday Morning"" by James, ""Foggy Notion"" by Echo And The Bunnymen, ""Pale Blue Eyes"" by Mock Turtles and ""European Son"" by Ride."
4,Cesaria at her best,"Probably in the ""happier"" period for Evora's career, this album shows this great artist at her best.This album is filled both with slow and fast rhythms: in other words, capoverdian typical ""mornas"" and ""coladeras"" which made Cesaria Evora famous.Definitely, an album which touches, amuses and lasts."
5,Another great story from Jane and Jay,The second installment in the Jane stories is magnificent. I reccomend this book to all those who loved Jane's adventures in Swimming Lessons and those who have yet to discover her spunk and charm. Jay once again proves her talent as an author and brillant insight into the mind of a child.
5,Warning,"After you experience the explosive energy, depth, and creativity shown on this album, you may find it difficult to appreciate your old favorites like you once did. I know I have.Why an artist like Devin remains relatively obscure is beyond me. All I can say is, please buy his albums so he can afford to go on making music for us."
4,definitely worth buying,"written mostly by Devin Townsend, with some credit given to Gene Hoglan, but recorded by all the members of Strapping Young Lad. its basically like a b-sides of SYL, but not quite as heavy. I totally dig this CD and would definitely recommend this to any fan of SYL. And as an extra bonus the disc is enhanced with commentary given by Devin as he explains the meaning for each song."
3,MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT,"This is a pretty bracelet, unfortunately the gold sparkles more than the diamonds do. They are of a low quality. Still I love the bracelet which was a gift from my boyfriend. He was even surprised at the size of the diamonds, the picture makes them look larger than they are - what you see is the illusion setting that they are in."
3,Great Display hanger,"Purchased this in order to cut it down and hand over a doorway where I could then insert a fly-screen - to be removed in winter and put back up next summer. It worked a treat - cutting was simple with a hacksaw, and it now supports the desired screen. Well done. Full marks also to Amazon, delivered well ahead of schedule to Australia. Super service."
4,World Traditional Music,Very traditional music with fine display of the classical instruments. Good mix of fast and slow pieces. This Vol.1 complements the Vol.2
1,THIS IS NOT SUNDANESE MUSIC,"This is clearly Balinese music, not Sundanese/West Javanese.I bought this CD years ago and was astonished to hear Balinese music, with a picture of a Balinese dancer on the front cover.How this can sell as Sundanese music, I have no idea.Bali is a Hindu island, totally separate from Java, a mainly Muslim island.Do not buy this album if you are looking for Sundanese classic, jaipong, or degung music."
3,"Ok, but not great","I recognize the value of these bars, and like them reasonably well, but not anywhere near enough to rate them 5 or even 4 stars. I never finished the box before they were out of date (didn't throw them out - just ate the remaining ones after the ""best before"" date. Still tasted the same - moderately good. Gluten free is a big plus for this bar, and one of the main reasons I bought a box.Oh - worried about the THC content? I work for a major organization that does no-notice urinalysis on employees, using some of the most sophisticated testing equipment available. I did not come up positive for anything on the day of my no-notice drug test. These seem to be quite safe since there's only a tiny, tiny bit of THC in them per the company and per my experience with testing.GRITS"
3,"""Record Shack""","I bought this particular CD for ""Boys Come to Town' & esp. ""Primitive Desire"". Unfortunately BOTH songs were SHORT Versions. ""Primitive Desire"" didn't seem to SOUND the same as it did when I knew it from 1984 (Good & Extended Mix). The CD is ok for one who would like to have these classics all on one CD."
3,"The movie stands by itself, do not focus on song","I recently watched the film and the actors give stellar performances. Not growing up during the era of the Gentry song, I did not focus on the song and how the movie explained the song. Instead I simply watched the movie and enjoyed it, even today it resonates timely and important issues (I do not want to ruin the film for those who have not seen it by saying what issues). I was also suprised that it was only given 2 1/2 stars. I have read some other reviews and am suprised that some disliked this film, but I am young and a lot of the movies, during my lifetime, have definately lacked great actors and stories."
2,Not bad,"This movie couldn't hold a candle, though, to Bobbie Gentry's song. The song was so mysterious. It led you to wonder why Billy Joe killed himself, of course, and what exactly they threw off the Tallahatchee Bridge. The movie took the mystery out of the song. This isn't a very literate review, I'm afraid, but this film isn't exactly inspiring."
2,Watch it.....if you want to be depressed.,"The movie, in my opinion, had no point.It was ridiculously depressing and leaves the audience thinking..""What the [heck] did I watch that for?!"" Although Robby Benson is staggeringly good-looking, don't waste 2 hours of your life on this movie!"
3,BURY THIS MOVIE FOREVER,"I believe the reason this film has not been released on DVD is that it is dangerous. It dramatises a gay young man who kills himself when he has sex with an older man. I loved the movie for many years for its sensitive performances and poetic script, but it is dated and the more we know about teenage suicides and the more prevelant they become in this day and age, the more I realise here is a movie that should be buried forever. It feeds into the emotions that drive young people to kill themselves. Say goodbye to this movie, it should never see the light of day again."
1,I can't believe what I'm reading,"I'm astonished that anyone liked this movie. Maybe they're young and have only seen it recently on video. But I saw it when it first came out, when the song itself was what the public was familiar with, and the movie was not only a critical and box office bomb, but people were downright offended by its interpretation of the song's mysteries (particularly what the pair threw off the bridge). I know I was. The movie was a joke then, and it's a joke today."
4,Amazon please change the Product Description,"The product description tells the ending - something that the song never did (It just left you to wonder). This needs to be addressed for people who have not seen the movie!BTW, I wish it was available on DVD - the VHS is outdated and the prices are too high for a movie!"
4,Good movie but...,why do so many reviewers find it necessary to reveal the big secret? I hate you all.Take a tip from professional movie critics who can pass judgment on the quality of the film without blowing the ending for those who haven't seen it yet.
4,Benson and O'Connor make this film worthwhile,"Great performances from Robbie Benson and Glynnis O'Connor, and a fine supporting cast too. But the story comes up short in trying to fulfil the intrique of Bobbie Gentry's song. There's a wonderful, dream-like and wistful soliloquay by O'Connor after Billie Joe's death - a highlight. (But a cluck of the tongue to the propmaster who allowed a guitar player in the barnyard band to play an Ovation acoustic guitar - they weren't available in the 50s!)."
4,this movie touched me,"although i am only in my twenties, i find myself liking older movies, maybe because i think it would be fun to live in the 70's. i agree this movie must be watched with a very open mind, and be taken with a grain of salt, but there is just something about it that grabs me, gets in my head and puts me in a different train of thought. it's real and in your face and has a very nice & unique romantic plot. although the movie presents homosexuality, and other raw topics, i still find it brillant. i feel this movie is special to those who appreciate the culture, truth & emotion brought to you by these astounding actors."
5,Not just for babies!,"I absolutely love the Soothing and Healing Calming Blend. I could use it on the kids, sure, but I love it for myself! I use it at night as my moisturizer after washing my face. Since it's an oil, you would think you would feel greasy all night, but it soaks in very quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.Love it."
4,"Good Cd, after a few listens","I was excited about this cd, since I had their first one. I'll have to admit, I was disappointed at first, but I have grown to really like this project. While I can't say that every song is a great song, there are a couple of gems, and the rest are solid efforts. It seems that Nu City Mass is at it's best when they are just doing down-home, church songs. I do like ""Souled Out"", alot, though. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone, just give it a few listens before you pass judgement."
3,pretty good,"For purposes purchased it works well but the mandel and sandpaper part tends to get loose fitting after a while. I purchased new mandels but don't know how long they will hold tight. Wish that the unit that holds these in place could be adjusted tighter as one uses it as I'm afraid with a great deal of use, eventually the attachments just won't stay in or function."
2,turbo 2400 manicure kit,Product works fairly well but cannot figure out how to change sanding sleeves
4,Great if you can figure out how to use it,"I would say that this one is great for bikers, although, if you bike you probably already have one on the handlebar. It was way to big for my wrist, and it is somewhat heavy. Also, no light. I am not technologically challenged, but found the menus next to impossible to understand. Also, the manual might as well have been written in chinese (which I do not speak). Polar makes better monitors in my opinion."
2,"OK HRM, Bad Bike Computer","I had this unit for about four months. During that time I used it exclusively as a HRM monitor. It worked well after a good reading of the manual. However, when I tried to set up the wired bike monitor the unit would not record distance or speed. After reading around it seems like this unit has a problem recording this information reliably. I returned the Polar and went with a Suunto T3 with Bike Pod. The Suunto works beautifully and is a very well designed product. I would highly recommend it over the Polar S150."
3,"very complicated, still doesn;t do what i want","no backlightno calories usedhave to manually switch zones when timers expireannoying 'send back to factory for battery changing' featurewhat i really want is this:tell me how long i was in any of 3 zoneslight, aerobic, anaerobicthis one will not really do itit has all kinds of fancy OTHER stuff[which only makes it hard to use]i had a sports instruments fit 3 that did, and it;s cheapand has a backlight, but i had 2 of them break[wrist strap pin holders break, weak plastic]and it didn;t have either a countdown alarm, a stopwatchor a daily clock alarmoh - you can use a sports instruments transmitter with itwle."
1,Sounds better backwards,"If you play ""OOps I did it again"" backwards,it says,""Niaga ti Did I Spoo."" It sounds so much better than playing it forward."
5,Excellent New Track From Britney Spears,"Britney Spears never ceases to amaze me. Unlike others like Christina Aguilara or Jessica Simpson, all of Britney's songs are exceptional in their quality. It doesn't hurt that Swedish song writer/producer Max Martin is behind a lot of her stuff....his creativity is endless. OOPS....I DID IT AGAIN is a jammin' song that recalls earlier Spears music, but is more mature with a harder edge. Spears and Martin succeed on this one! It is the catchiest chorus I have heard in a while, and the middle dialogue (spoken by Martin himself) is awesome. This particular single also contains a throw-away song and a lame remix of FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY BROKEN HEART."
5,Awesome!!!,These remixes are awesome! Especially Ospina's Crossover Mix I think that that is the best one. Heres a review on all the songs:1. Album Version- Simply the best one of all after number 3! 5/52. Rodney Jerkins Mix- This remix is ok but it kind of gets on your nerves arter a while. 3/53. Ospina's Crossover Mix- This is my favorite remix on the CD! This is better than the album version! The best one of all! 10/54. Riprock 'N' Alex G.'s Oops! We Remixed Again (Radio Mix)- This mix is ok but it could have been better. 3/55. Ospina's Deep Club Mix- This is real cool. 3/56. Riprock 'N' Alex G.'s Oops! We Remixed Again (Club Mix)- good. 3/57. Ospina's Instrmental Dub- This is great! 4/5Overall Ospina's remixes are better.
4,Oops!... She Did It Again,"This is a very cool single of Britney Spears' ""Oops!... I Did It Again"". With the original hit, and 6 remixes, this CD amounts to 30 minutes of fun. While the original is great, the Oops! remixes are equally awesome. Ranging from 3 minutes to 6 minutes, all of the remixes are fun and danceable. While not perfect, this remix disc is a fun addition to your CD collection. It will get you on the dancefloor and you will have a great time listening to this. It is a must have for Britney fans, and a great CD to own for everyone else. Highly recommended and very very fun. ENJOY!!!"
5,The Facts Behind the Scenes,This is a wonderful book for the novice. It shows a thread of connecting many events in Americas history-very interesting.
2,Recent Diana Palmer Books Just Aren't The Same,"Diana Palmer has always been one of my favorite authors. Perhaps I have matured past the point where I can enjoy them. I've grown weary of the man being 10 to 15 years older than the woman and the woman being so weak. Usually the woman has gone through a lot in her life but doesn't come across as being stronger for it. Unfortunately, this book can't compare to Ms. Palmer's ""Soldier of Fortune""."
3,"Mercenarys Woman (Romance, 1444","If you have read the other Soldier of Fortune books by Diana Palmer you will be disappointed in this one. I have waited two months for this book. I couldn't wait to read it. This was let me just hurry up with this book! Don't get me wrong I love Diana Palmer books, but this one is definitely not up to par."
4,Palmer's Mercenaries are Back!,"Just returned from a disaster in Africa, mercenary soldier Ebenezer Scott went too far in discouraging teenager Sally Johnson's crush. Now, six years later, Eb has left his active service and wants to woo Sally, but first he must protect her, her blind aunt and young cousin from returning enemies.Sally and Eb's love story is joined by a separate story about her aunt and a former lover, distracting the reader. In addition, other mercenaries are introduced for future books, grabbing your attention. That said, this is still a terrific book, mixing the action and romance nicely. Sally is now enough woman to accept Eb's work, rough visitors, and Eb's macho quirks. You will even feel pity for drug lord and killer, Manuel Lopez, a man with his own peculiar honor.I look forward to stories about Cy and Lisa, Maggie and Cole, Callie and Micah. And please give Rodrigo his own woman."
1,Anti-climatic (disappointing ending),"Read Soliders of Fortune and it was a definite 5 star. Hoped that Diana Palmer would carry the same intensity over to this book but something was definitely missing. The ending was totally unbelieveable. Children, today, are not kidnapped especially by drug lords only to be returned without a fight, no ransom, no anything! Had interesting characters and if the author would have added another fifty pages of action and intensified the ending this book could have rated at least 4 stars instead of 1!"
3,It Was Pretty Good,"Though I didn't find it as an utter disappointment that other reviewers seemed to find the book, I did somewhat enjoy it and found that although the story could have had a little more length to it to add some more action, I enjoyed the hero and heroine. I had been looking forward to getting this book and as it was not one of the best books that I have read by Ms. Palmer, I can't say that it has been the worst either."
1,.......................,"I have been reading Diana Palmer for the past 18 years, and I have to say that this is the worst book that I have ever read by her. Maybe I am just getting too old for her typical storyline of slightly emotionally scarred virgin. What girl in this day and age gets that put off by a grope in a truck by the man she has been chasing for 2 years. How many virgins can there be and why do all the great rough and tough men live in Jacobsville? Puhleeze! I was partially disapointed because I expected J.D. and Gaby to be in this and that was one of my favorites. If you are looking for them, don't, they are vaguely referenced in one line. Goodluck getting through this, I persevered hoping that it would get better. Do yourself a favor, if you have to read this because you love the author, wait for the used book store, I am sure they will be over run with copies from other disapointed reader."
4,Good Read,I love Diana Palmer Books but would not recommend this book if you have not read her previous soldier of fortune works. She brings back many of the characters from these books and the story can become very confusing if you are not familiar with them. That said I had trouble putting the book down. Eb and Sally really spark flames off of each other! Way to go Diana!
2,disappointing,"Too vague, rambling, hard to follow. Really needed an editor or proof reader. Not up to Diana Palmer's usual stadards. Seem to be an introduction to follow up books."
5,Richard Marx,Their nothing else to say here. The man is a legend. One of the best singer/songwriters in the business today.
3,THREE STAR VACATION,"Marx's PAID VACATION is standard formulaic nineties pop, delivered with strong professionalism and masterful musicianship.It's not one of my personal favorites, but it does foreshadow Marx's migration to a more mature development to be more fully achieved in future efforts.""Now and Forever"" is a nice ballad, less dramatic than his previous hits, and is lovely in its simplicity. ""Soul Reunion"" has an effective bluesiness reminiscent of his 'Keep Coming Back""; ""The Way She Loves Me"" and ""What You Want"" are infectious up-tempo offerings. ""One Man"" is a little too overwrought and ""Baby Blues"" seems superfluous in its brevity.I think ""Flesh and Bones,"" ""Avalon,"" and ""My Own Best Enemy"" are better albums, showing a more sophisticated artist's maturation."
3,Good!,"Think crunchy peanut butter vs. creamy..that's the type of peanut butter flavor you'll get.These bars are good, but not great. I prefer the other Nature's Path bars that I've tried over this variety. You're not getting the omegas like you'd get in the flax variety and it seems like more fat/sugar than it's nutritionally worth.Honestly, you could eat a 'Zone' bar or something of that sort for it's calorie/fat content in this variety.I love Nature's Path, but wouldn't purchase bulk of this flavor again."
5,Peanutbuttery goodness,"These are sweet and salty, melt in your mouth , and still decent for you. The sugar content is low, while the protien is high---you can't lose with such a natural bar that tastes so good!"
5,Husband-approved!,My husband actually likes these! That's rare - he's picky. They are much more healthy than those quaker granola bars or most any other kind. Fair priced. Larger sized bars than I had expected.
2,"Mostly great, but the snaps need some TLC","First, the good:This thing is constructed very well. It holds 1911 or Glock mags with no problems. Adjustable or removable flaps cover the mags to protect them from the elements. Stitching is great, as is the color.Now, the bad: I've used this mag pouch both on a MOLLE plate carrier and on a regular GI pistol belt. The snaps that secure it to either base will come off extremely easily, I'm talking with a brush of the finger. All the good quality that went into making the pouch doesn't mean anything if it comes off your belt/PC. I kept it for a backup but I'm now looking for something more secure."
3,not bad,"its a good fit for beretta 9mm mags but the molle straps in the back are not space out far enough, it was a tough fit on my plate carrier"
4,The Doula Book,"This was the first book I read on doulas and becoming one. It has a lot of useful information and techniques that are sure to be helpful during labor. It also helps you try to understand labor from that point of view, as opposed to being the person in labor. Great book!"
3,Snooze!,"I bought this book because I'm becoming a birth doula. This book well to be honest it has great stats and information but that is all this book is. Yes the entire book is stats of how awesome doulas are! So, unless you have to buy it for a doula cert or you want to rub some stats in someone's face then don't buy this book! Luckily for me it's a short book so I was able to make it all the way through well most of the way through."
3,Don't waste your money!,"This book has great stats, but I would not waste your money on the book if you are expecting much more. I would borrow the book or buy it used if you are intesred in looking up how great doula's are :)"
1,Out of date info,Read other books and find that this is for people in the maybe 70's! It is not interesting for my 2004 life. Don't be fooled by the horror stories and read other books that depict the good points and bad points but not just the bad.
1,Not an accurate portrayal,"This book is best left on the shelf, or at least check it out at the library first, if you want to buy it. The language is outdated and it is a dry read. one of the few books I have never finished. There are several better books on doulas and labor support. Ones that are written with a much more modern view."
2,Not a great pregnancy book,"I read this book while I was pregnant, because it was recommended. I can't say that I figured out why it was recommended. Many folks have commented that it was a great book for those studying to be a doula, but I wasn't.If you are attempting a natural child birth in a hospital, hire a doula. She lowers your risks for numerous interventions. However, that can be said in one sentence and backed up with a few paragraphs."
3,Direct replacement,"The ONLY reason I gave this product 3 stars is because after 2 months its bad. It is impossible to get Amazon to handle the warranty for this item. I have contacted Federal - Mogul about the warranty issue and am awaiting a response. Otherwise, the grease fitting and the VERY smart redesign for the use of a wrench instead of an allen wrench was an excellent thought. Its a little tricky trying to grease it, but it is possible with the use of a bottle jack."
3,Poor Barbara Payton!!! Sad story.,"First read Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (excellent book). Then read this one by the actress herself. Reading her drunk ravings gives you the entire pathetic picture... Very sad. She was a mess at this point. You'll find yourself shaking your head and wondering how any publisher could exploit her when she was so far gone. It's terrible to call a mentally ill, drug addicted, alcoholic such bad names as some reviewers have. I hope she's resting in peace now."
3,Too much passion,"Barbara Payton's ""I am not Ashamed "" a quickly written glossy and slick meandering of a confused narcissistic life with a few deprecating insights and incidents thrown in for good measure. By Payton's own account everyman wanted her and she seemingly never met a man who wasn't moneyed, handsome, and successful. No doubt Barbara Payton was a beautiful woman with talent and sex appeal all around and one who had the start of successful career, which went down in flames with her at the controls. Too much passion, too many obsessions and not enough good sense. A story many times told owing to the emotional vagaries of human beings but as it has been said, ""time and chance happens to them all."""
2,"""Forever is just a weekend, more or less.""","So it was for beautiful Barbara Payton, a lusty young starlet of the 1950's. This pulpy-tale rambles with the incoherent musings of a young woman who through her sexual arrogance wrecked a promising career. At one time she earned ten-thousand dollars a week in a time when the average per-capita income was considerly less. Yet her self-destuctive behavoir damned her to follow the tabloid scripting of a ""bad girl"". Her conspicous consumption took its inevitable toll and left her penniless, broken, forgotten, and without shame. In short, who cares. I grant one star for effort and one for comedic value; no more no less."
2,Trash,"This book is awful, and not even good trash. Instead, read John Gilmore's new book about LA Despair,. which has a more colorful account of the life and times of Payton"
4,One of Thompson's oddest... and best,"Richard Thompson is an artist of phenomenal talent, but inconsistent quality. If you're looking for great writing, go get Rumor and Sigh and listen to ""1952 Vincent Black Lightening"" (many fans rave about his Shoot Out the Lights album, but I found it a bit pedestrian). If you're looking for the guitarist in peek form, get Guitar/Vocal and listen to ""Calvary Cross"" and ""Night Comes In."" However, if you're looking for some truly creative and sonically interesting music, check this album out. This is RT at his dark best-- taking sounds and musical phrases that don't seem to belong together and making them work. Rock, Folk, Celtic, Arabic, Blues, Jazz-- they all come together in this album cohesively and satisfyingly."
3,Another Mitchell Froom-produced RT album,"If you're a fan, you'll have to have it. There's not much else to distinguish it from his other Mitchell Froom/Capitol albums, except:1. It has the least electric guitar of any of his solo albums besides ""Henry the Human Fly.""2. It has the dumbest song he's ever written: ""Fast Food.""3. He steals the ""Cinammon Girl"" guitar riff in ""For The Sake of Mary.""4. There's another gut-wrenching emotional acoustic number (a la ""1952 Vincent..."") in ""Beeswing.""This was the album where RT fans began to feel he was getting a bit stale and started mumbling ""he needs a new producer."" Unfortunately, he wasn't listening, leading to the more-of-the-same ""you? me? us?"""
5,my favorite RT album,"Mitchell Froom's inventive production (surely a personal best) gives each of these songs a delightfully individual feel. Mr. Thompson matches it with his best collection of songs ever, nearly every one a classic. How could anyone give this marvelous CD less than five stars? One of the all time great disks."
4,a book still quite relevant to the soul of man,"If you've ever been concerned the fate of your soul and the existence of god this is the book to read.It provides you with both the freedom to worship or the freedom to blaspheme. Berdyaev enacts valid and convincing moral arguments to make paramount the freedom of man to choose his destiny; heaven or hell. You very well may come away,like I did, from his still relevant arguments with a deeper appreciation for your freedom and stronger will to resist all forms of tyranny:the social, the religious and the economic.Ultimately the moral liberty of the individual to be an agnostic or a believer is superior to any religion's determination to get him/her to heaven."
3,Interesting selection but give me the hits please,This recent release is excellent sound quality but lacking in reflection of his long hit making career. The greatest hits package on Black Tulip that I bought from Continental Records is a good comprehensive collection of his pop material.
2,Story Line has Major Flaws !,"If your interested in creating anime professionaly I suggest getting this title as a reference. If your on the other hand looking for a great story line as well as animation I suggest ""Lodos War"". Which has both. It's obvious that the company decided to spend more time on the characters animation than on a story line. The character animation was very detailed. Very high quality renderings of battle scenes. You can actually see characters fighting not unlike some videos that take one frame of battle scene and glide you throught it."
2,an okay ova sereis,perosnally this movie was half bad and half goodgood a way to show fire emblem mars and all the charters were good but the green archer i hated.the bad part was it was way to short cmon they didnt evan defeat the main ememey that killed mars is father and it was only an hour long personlly this ova needs to be reralesd on dvd extend verson and make it as long as the four ova epsidoes like darkstallkers nightwarriors which is about close to 3 hours but is would be asome i mean cnom fire emblem is war they must keep fighting until the main viallin is dead i mean really nintendo pls reralse this on dvd extend and make it long like lord of the rings really pls then this ova would kick ass just take all the chaperters of fire emblem sword of light and dragon of darkness from the nes. i mean just do that pls if the fire emblem games sell well pls heck i would care less if you made the chapters shorter so cmon nintend o make the product for what its worth really
1,Irritating!,"The heroine was positively irritating! She was so hopelessly and arrogantly incompetent, constantly getting herself and everyone who wished to help her into dire straits. It was absolutely painful to read about her exploits and continuous helplessness. I have never written a review but felt driven to express my thoughts on this unbelievably idiotic character."
4,Almost great...not quite there,"This book is very detailed in the history of the Stratocaster and has some good historical information about Fender and CBS. Great detail for learning how to date a Stratocaster (especially for those novices looking to buy on Ebay). The information is chronologically presented and the text formatting is inconsistent. The b&w; photos are printed poorly.This book is in serious need of an update (it references through Stratocasters manufactured in 1993). There is also a purist approach to not consider Fender's 2nd line (the Squier Brand) which has (in some people's opinions), higher quality than what carried the Fender name (at least in the mid-80's).In the absence of a better publication, I highly recommend this book."
2,Still looking,The Fender Stratocaster: foreword by Eric ClaptonThere is a wealth of information here but much of it is poorly presented. Spelling errors on almost every page along with very poor quality photos give a very amateurish feel to what could be a well researched book. Wiring schematics that need a magnifying glass to examine could have been enlarged or left out. I'd like to see the new improved model.
1,"Good Book, but Kindle Blew It!","I've owned the paperback version of this book for years. Great book with tons of detailed specs on the Fender Stratocaster. The book is a bit out of date by today's standards, but informative in it's own right. I would love to see an updated version repressed.I purchased the Kindle for Mac version of the book on Amazon to have access to the book electronically & in turn minimize my physical library. Big Mistake! The Kindle version does not support color. Think; black & white scanned PDF type document. Bummer. I will reconsider future Kindle book purchases as the result of this transaction. This would not have been a problem had it been a traditional text book, but not a book with detailed color photography. Hey Amazon, what were you thinking?Side note; The Telecaster version is equally wonderful also.Future Kindle Reader & Kindle Book buyers should save their cash & purchase a better product like the Apple iPad."
3,Somewhat outdated & not the best quality,"This book is fine, but it's about 10 years old! The print quality leaves much to be desired, although what's there is accurate. Look for something more up-to-date."
4,Nice book.,"Nice book. Well written, and gives good information about years, materials and marks of the Stratocaster over the years."
4,unexpected song,"when amii stewart dropped her classic cover of 'knock on wood', more than a few people wondered where she would go vocally. who would have ever thought she would have gone here.'friends' is a lovely, light jazz tune, well produced and beautifully performed with a unique sensuousness. although it has a release year of 1991, i remember the song from as early as 1978 or 1979. maybe this is a re-release that played on wnua stations across the country."
5,FZ Fans with Surround Systems Need This!,"I have been a Frank Zappa fan for 32 years but I just recently set up my first surround sound system with a multi-channel DVD-Audio / SACD player. I wanted hear FZ in surround so I ordered this DVD-Audio disc. If you like FZ's music and you have a surround sound set-up (especially one that includes a DVD-Audio player) then you need to hear this disc! The sound is incredible, particularly on the 1970 (!) recording of ""Chunga Basement,"" which is one of the most amazing FZ recordings I have ever heard, mono, stereo, surround or otherwise!Note: If you have a standard DVD player that cannot handle DVD-Audio but can decode dts, then you can still enjoy the surround sound program via the disc's dts layer, but you won't get the same high-resolution surround sound that is available on the DVD-Audio layer."
4,Missippian Culture for the General Reader,"The author has both excavated and written profusely on the Missippian Culture, centered in Cahokia to the East of Saint Louis, and the builders of the largest pyramids in North America. The culture flourished in the later Medieval times, just before the white men came to North America. Cahokia should be a famous as Chichen Itza and Tikal--this book is a superb introduction to the culture and to the scholarly discputes about its origins and acheivements.Every well educated American should be familiar with Missippian culture. Read this book!"
1,I'm so disappointed,"What a fascinating subject, but what a disappointing book. The author, though obviously an expert in the field, should stick to writing for archaeological journals and stay away from books for the general public. Simple, declarative sentences, engaging graphics, fascinating photographs would make this little-known subject come to life, but unfortunately not one of these is to be found in this book. Instead you'll be subjected to such dreadful prose as ""When compared with the material evidence of orthodoxy at Lohmann phase Cahokia, these lines of evidence indicate cultural diversity, persistence, hybridity, and creolization."" Unless your idea of fun is reading 177 pages like this, stay away from this book."
3,A personal journey,"This book is about two times the thickness it should be - the majority of the book is personal recounts of shows the author has directed or in which he has had a hand, and it ends up being a constant self-citing. The book imparts some information about theatre for young audiences, and it is indeed informative, but it certainly takes a measured amount of digging.Also, as I was asked to obtain this book as a text book, I was somewhat disappointed that the book is not indexed. But no matter - the book will teach you a thing or two about theatre for young audiences, and it will not cost you an arm and a leg, either."
4,invu,i think this book clearly explains how a teens life of not liking a boys is....even some descriptions dont match students in koreaneverything else (mostly) seems real.
1,Reused.,"I have to agree. Just like romantic comedy films, they use the same story line over, and over, and over again...Why bother with this one and just read one of the other thousand mangas just like it????... Honestly. How many times are they going to be able to use this SAME plot, without anybody noticing anything?! So, lets see...Interesting story? NO! Likeable Charectors? None here! :) Entertaining? Not at All!!!! ..."
2,Nothing Special....,"I will admit, I really only got this because I liked how the author drew the charectors on the cover. I learned not to judge a book by its cover long ago w/ Daupne Du Mauriers Rebecca, w/ its sleazy looking cover. The main difference is that that turned out to be great, when I thought it would be slutsy... (And also, I.N.V.U. is a graphic/anime novel...)But, this one was just plain stale. Honestly, I have heared this same souped up story numerous times in many other anime. A teenage girls life turns topsy-turvy, and she falls in love w/ two differnt people (w/one whos older than her). Wow. How totally unique. I've never seen or heared anything like it before. NOT. Also, it was just plain boring. I forced myself to get it over w/ but couldint even finsih the last five pages, or so. NOT RECCOMENDED. GET SOMETHING FUNNY AND DIFFERNT LIKE RANMA 1/2. SERIOUSLY!"
2,A*Teens Have Grown Up... What a Disappointment,"When I first heard ""Abba Generation"" by the A*Teens, I was impressed. When I heard ""Teen Spirit"" by the A*Teens I became addicted. I loved their happy, innocent sound and enthusiasm. So I was very excited to finally get 'Pop 'Til You Drop' from amazon.com. Until I heard it. The A Teens have grown up, and in doing so have switched their material from the kind that set them apart to the type of music which is being mass produced. I can buy any CD now and hear this type of music. I miss the A*Teens with all their innocence and fun; their catchy melodies and great fun lyrics. I was disappointed with this album... one of the lead female's singers (I think it's Sara) sounds horrible on ""This Year""; what happened to that beautiful voice of hers? The only song that sounds like their old happy upbeat selves has got to be 'Can't Help Falling in Love'. I was disappointed by this CD; if you want good music buy their first two CD's, but I would skip over this one."
2,What a disappointment,"This album marks a dramatic turn from Teen Spirit -- in the wrong direction. Originality and variety have been sacrificed for a collection of uninteresting dance tunes and uninspired covers. ""Closer to Perfection"" takes the band back to their ABBA roots, but as the album's title suggests, the rest of the lyrics aspire to nothing more than a request for some dance music."
4,A*TEENS DOES IT AGAIN!!!,"Althought I like their previous CD a little better than this one, I still think they did great with the two remakes of ""School's Out"" and ""Can't Help Falling In Love."" Both are nice to dance too and I think they are just great. I can't wait to see what the A Teens do on their next album!"
4,Pop is right!,"Although not as consistently awesome as their last album, Teen Spirit, some tracks shine through brilliantly. The opening, Floorfiller is a fun way to start. The best track on the album, without a doubt, is Closer To Perfection - which is, well, close to perfection with a fantastic 80s vibe. Hi And Goodbye is also great, and features some wonderful broken English (""when did we stop see eye to eye?""). In The Blink Of An Eye is a nice ballad, and the closing track, School's Out, is still making me confused (who thought of joining A*Teens and Alice Cooper?), but it's fun, and evidently that's what's important."
1,Wow this one is stupid,"I'm sorry, a bunch of whiny teenagers singing to horrible techno is not good. I love electronica of all different kind. I also like pop music but his is [bad]. Floorfiller is so annoying that it sounds like Eiffel 65's offspring. If you want some upbeat electronica try Alien Factory (which is very hard to find) even Happy Hardcore maker Scooter is way better than this. The A*Teens are just [bad] pop along with Dreamstreet and Play. Please record agencies, no more Lil Romeo's and Aaron Carter's. Leave the music up to the grown ups."
3,¡QUE DESILUCION!,"LASTIMA EL DINERO QUE GASTE COMPRANDO ESTE CD ME HUBIERA COMPRADO MEJOR UNDER CONSTRUCTION DE MISSY ELLIOTT, ESTE CD SOLAMENTE TIENE UNA ROLA BUENA LA CUAL ES LA DE FLOORFILLER Y OTRAS 2 DE RESTO EL CD CD ES UN COMPLETO ASCO."
2,I regret buying this,"I'm usually a huge A-teens fan, but this changed my attitude. They should've stuck w/ just ABBA songs. The lyrics are dumb, their outfits on the cover are dumb, everything's just fluffy and DUMB. Example of lyrics: Let's finish what we started/ don't be so chickenhearted. I gave it 2 stars, though, because there are 2 songs on here that I like-1)Can't Help Fallin' in Love. I bought the CD because I loved this song and thought that the rest of the CD would follow in its footsteps.2)Hi and Goodbye. @ first I didn't like this, but it's really a sweet ballad about a couple who really doesn't know why it all didn't work out and want to fit the pieces back together. Or at least that's how I interpret it. Don't buy this CD, spend your money on a Hi and Goodbye or a CHFIL single."
1,Stick with S Club's new album!,"Sorry but A-teens are just not good enough compared to S Club. S Club has a new sound that is way more mature than their old songs and way more dancy. You will pop till you drop with S Club but I really dought it will happen with A-teens. So trust me, go out and buy S Club's newest album ""Don't Stop Movin' "" It's great!"
1,A couple songs were great but the other ones................,"I only bought the cd at first because of the song I can't help falling in love with you, so I figured I'd like all of the others because I liked all there other hits but boy was I in for a real suprise! Besides the songs ""I can't help falling in love with you"" and ""Floorfiller"" the cd is not worth listening to in my opinion. I thouht some of the songs had no meanings. I defenitely recommend their earlier music and cds instead of this one."
1,Please...,"you know its sad when you BRAG about having pop til u drop on a cd... and it didnt take me the whole album to drop to the floor in a lack of good music. my friend loves this cd and frankly, you cannot call this dance. i am a dance/techno/house/trance fan, and this falls into NONE of those categories. it is sickeningly cheesy, and they even try to look cool on the cover. Pathetic."
4,"Oops, They Did It Again","All right, so I'm not sure exactly what image the A-Teen are trying to conjure with their new album, but I must say that the songs, while somewhat annoying at times, are catchy little masterpieces that I can seem to get out of my head. Sure, the songs are trivial and trite, but hey...songs don't have to be chock full of meaning. Sometimes it's better if they're meaningless. ""Let Your Heart Do All the Talking"" and ""Oh Oh Yeah"" are definitely my favorite songs on the album. The only song that HAS to go is the remake of ""School's Out"" with (gasp) Alice Cooper? The song is, in a word, moronic, and it makes everyone singing look like they have a degenerative brain disorder. But cut off the last track and the album is great...it'd get five stars except for ""School's Out""."
3,Wow,"even though Marie has green stripes in her hair and Sara has blue streeks in her hair on the album cover,it's not at all punky.It's good."
5,Whoa! This album will blow you away!!,"If you don't have Pop 'Til You Drop...what are you waiting for?!Don't miss out on great music. Go out and buy it! I guarantee you will not be dissapointed at all. I give it 5 stars!Out of their previous albums, this one is the best! It's catchier than ever! Pop 'Til You Drop features a great variety of music styles.With everything from addicting dance tunes that will just make you pop out of your seat to inspiring ballads with great vocals, you will refuse to press the STOP button. This album is for all occasions, whether your at home laying in you bed, at the beach, on the road, or at a dance!...this is the album you'll want to have with you!This is definitely...the album of the year"
3,Did they do it again? Maybe not...,"A*Teens are an awesome group, but I am some what disappointed with this CD. I have listened to it 3 times, and I think that it will start to grow on me...but if you are a first time A*Teens' CD buyer, go with their last CD, Teen Spirit. That was thier best CD. So for this CD, its good...but I expected more from the A*Teens! I don't think they chose the best songs, but just like their last CD, I think it will grow on me!! The best song on this CD is probably ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" or ""Let Your Heart Do All The Talking"". I hope you enjoy this CD!! :o)"
5,Great CD,"this CD is great....both of the previous albums were good, but this is better. all of the songs were great, and i listened to it three times today. the remake of elvis' classic ""Can't Help Falling In Love With You"" was good, but you cant beat the original. What's even better is that the group co-wrote some of the songs and those songs aren't bad. i would recommend this to anyone who has followed the A*Teens through the past 3 years."
5,A nice piece of POP.,"This album is actually pretty good, it has a lot of nice songs, You can see an improvement in their lyrics, when you put it you forget about all your problems with the rhythm of the music, my personal fave's are: Floorfiller, Can't help..., Let you heart..., Hi and Goodbye, and School's out. JUST BUY IT."
5,Actually really good,"Ok, i admit it i like a teens, their songs are really great, and their new cd is awesome, i bought it and i become really impressed, i think that this is the best pop group ever (also s club 7) I'm fan of them since the abba generation, and their music is becoming better and better, the best songs for me are floorfiller, can't help falling in love, let you heart do all the talking, closer to perfection, slam and specially schools out, BUY IT."
5,I Will Never Drop!!!,"WOW!! What else is there to say? I bought this album on the release date and all I can say is wow! It is amazing pop. I knew the A-Teens were talented since their beginning and Pop 'Til You Drop has only supported my conclusion: these guys, Sara, Dhani, Marie, and Amit, will blow you away. Their vocals are smooth, sleek and tight and their music, if you're craving delicious pop, will be completely satisfy you! The A*teens have gone through a total maturation period. They sound so much more adult and they have grown up. However, the album still carries that rambunctious, happy go lucky feeling to it that makes them what they are. Standout tracks include: ""Hi and Goodbye,"" ""Closer to Perfection,"" ""School's Out"" /f/ Alice Cooper, and ""Cross My Heart."" Believe me, that is not all!! I am telling you, if you have any doubts about buying this album, forget about them!! You will thank yourself!! Don't drop this one, PICK IT UP!!!!"
3,Way Too Techno,"I own the A-Teens other two CDs, The Abba Generation and Teen Spirit, and those are both wonderful, and I was expecting the same from this. Boy was I in for a surprise. They [messed] up BAD. 4 out of the first five songs (Can't help falling in Love is the exception) sound only electric and just the same, but not in a good way. If you really like Techno music, then buy it, if you're an A-Teens fan like me, then you should buy it, but if you just like pop music and aren't really an A-Teens fan, then I would advise listening to the sound clips before purchasing. Even though this album was a total letdown, I am still an A-Teens fan and can't wait for their fourth album"
1,What about Torture til you drop?,"This is so damn annoying, wasn't it enough wuth the million abba covers they made? now they are making a cover of elvis classic ""Can't help falling in love"" to the new disney movie and another cover of Alice Coopers ""School's out"", it make sense, just wondering what grade they are finnish with, 4th or 5th?. This is true teen-pop for kids, get over it if you're a real music fan."
4,I can't help falling in love with them,"oh god...a teens are my guiltiesst pleasure! they are soooo cheezy, but their music is so damn addicting, and they are so cute! puppies in the video! what is that? but at the same time, it's adorable! to each her own...rock on a teens!"
3,programming and costomizing the PicAxe Microcontroller,"Lots of good information for the beginner, and lots of mistakes in the software and illistrations, and datasheets. You need to know electronics if you are to spot the mistakes and save a lot of hair pulling along the way when you wire up a board from the illistrations and it does not work. Gives some good info on the basic operation of these chips."
4,What I had hoped for,This book takes you from a complete beginner to an intermediate user of the picaxe. it has projects and explains them very well. I recommend it highly
2,You proably don't need to but this book,"I am new to the PICAXE so I was looking for all the information I could find. The [...] website has quite a bit but I felt like I needed more. I saw the book advertised with glowing reviews and ordered a copy at once. When the book came, I had gotten pretty familiar with the information on the web site and was looking for something more in depth. After looking at the book for quite some time, I still haven't found anything of use that can't be gotten from the web site. Actually, whenever I need information, I go to the web site instead of loking at the book. The picaxe user forum is also helpful. There may soon be other books on the PICAXE and I hope the authors do a better job than was done here."
4,A good update,"As with the first edition, this is a comprehensive overview of the picaxe micro. The section on the new M2 parts will help users understand the new arcitecture without throwing out their prior knowledge."
3,"Programming and Custonizing the Picaxe Microcontroller,","This is probably a good stating place for those who have no electronic or programing experince. I have given this book only a 3 star because most of the material is very basic. One dispointment was the index subject and page number did not match several subjects that I use the index to find. I now use the picaxe web site, it has good examples and is current and up to date with the latest part numbers. I must add that with the web site you have to print out the manual, i.e the reason for buying the book. In electronic everything gets dated pretty fast, as of now there are several new picaxe devices that are not in the book. As with most techincal book it will be good for some, fair for other, and of little value for a few."
2,M2 Supplement Only,"A decent book on the PICAXE family overall, but I wanted specific info on the new M2 series. Here, it is limited to a 30-page supplement tacked on to the end of the book. Not well-integrated and not as in-depth as I had hoped. Nothing you can't learn from studying the three free PICAXE manuals. 3 brief M2 experiments on DAC, touch sensors, and SR latch."
2,So so PIC book,I really liked this book at first but then I encountered a lot of typos. Even the code inside has to be checked and corrected. The information is good but the book needs proof checking and major corrections in structure.
2,self-serving,"As a distant relative of Pu-Yi, I can tell you he is self pitying, self-serving and self-indulgent. He admits no wrongdoing durring his 40 years as Emperor and gives only a line or two to his wife, Empress Wan Jung (or Elizabeth Wan). He talks about himself like he's a hero, when in fact he destroyed his family. Truth is, he wasn't too intelliigent by any standard. Read The Last Emperor by Albert Brachman. Much better."
3,"For Fans, a Great CD - For Newbies, You'll Like a GH Collection Better","For fans, this double set collects quite a few of their great tracks but it also leaves out quite a few tracks so it's not a very complete anthology.For newbies or casual fans who want the chart toppers only, the other tracks they included do not include any hidden gems and as mentioned by others, leave out some hidden gems.So, if you're just looking for the hits, better to get the GH collection, it's a much tighter package ... I'm also going to dock a point for not including the great covers of the original Lp's - of course, it's un-PC but why re-write history ;-)"
2,Disappointed,There's PLENTY and MUCH BETTER of their Mercury material that was omitted from this compilation! The albums most of these songs came from can attest to that. Oh well; at least the sound quality was phenomenal...
1,Cheap.....Do Not Expect To Be Satisfied,This item is only 0.53mm thick! Two layers of cheap electrical tape will afford you better tube protection! Save your money and your tubes and buy something else....anything else!!!!!!!
5,Great strips!,"Well worth the extra money! Fit better, thicker and the ends joined much better, very happy with this product overall."
5,Inexpensive and Works,These rim strips work great and have a good bit of talcum powder for preapplication. I have them doubled-up for added protection from the spokes and rim and they fit great. The pre-formed hole for the valve also seems to fit snuggly on the schrader valve which is great to reduce non-slipping and wearing of the strip.
2,Fair product,This product fits well but is fairly thin. To be fair though it is as thick as any that come in production bikes today. I would double this product foradditional protection.
5,"Excellent historic fortepiano replica, excellent performance","This recording is made on a replica of a 1726 Cristofori (AKA Cristofali, Cristofani) fortepiano, and makes use of an incredible expressive capability that is unavailable on modern pianos. I also find this recording much more expressive than music performed on the later Viennese fortepianos, that are more widely used in recordings.The performer, Luca Guglielmi, who has recorded baroque music on harpsichord and organ, brings a special sensitivity to the interpretation of early 18th century keyboard music.Of the composers on this recording, only Handel and Dominico Scarlatti are well known. The other composers (della Ciaja, Giustini, Marcello and Zipoli) provide delightful pieces which probably are of the gallant genre."
3,For the idle rich,"This is not what I expected: it's home movies of various riders, those who can afford expensive getaways abroad & here in the States. And ads. And mostly about gaited horses. Blah blah blah...best mag out there for horse people is ""Horse & Rider."""
3,Enough Quirk To Merit A Look,"Probably deserves a 3.5 stars on my rating scale.There are some really great tracks here, mixed in with some forgettable ones. Standout tracks include Kool Bavaria, an amazingly smooth french jazz exploration that manages to surprise, and Channel Zero, a wonderful chord progression with well-chosen vocal melody and surrealistic poetic lyrics. (I disagree with previous reviewer about this track... I scratched my head and then decided it was great!)Disappointments include dull bossa number ""Quiet Night"" (where is Amon Tobin to do bossa when you need him?) and the soulless and, sadly, MIDI-programmed rendition of ""Summertime""."
4,Nu-Jazz goes full-tilt ...,"Saint Germain des Pres Cafe Version #3 is one of the most eclectic and addictive CD's I've heard. Mix of classic jazz samples fused with electronica and smooth-as-silk vocals is instantaneously addicitive. This Nu-jazz CD is audio heroin.NuSpirit Helsinki's delicious 'Trying' is both beat-deep and lyrical poetry. Infracom's soothing 'Quiet Night' carries an addictive Bossa-nova beat to a neat and very cathchy song. DJ Cam's 'Un Ete a Paris' is a beast of a cut; scat drumming and waist-high bass beats. This song is off the chain! Llorca's 'The Novel Sound' and Variety Lab's 'R.Bevor' keep the high-tempo electro-jazz beats buzzing. Vocal kudos go to Fertile Ground's 'Take Me Higher'. Wow, this woman's got pipes! Beautiful song!Anyone tinkering with the Nu-jazz sound should look no futher than this CD to feed the need. Catchy beats deep with classic jazz samples combined into a seriously listenable CD all around.This ones a B-U-Y!-Steve"

1,Why do you sell junk?,"We purchased one of these chairs from this company (different Cadillac logo on the back, but same chair) for use at car shows. After 3 uses, the cheap plastic retainer bracket cracked and rendered the chair useless. I am a light to medium sized person, 5'10"" and 160 lbs. so overweight was NOT the cause of failure.The manufacturer has done nothing to replace or refund for the faulty product, and I am presently looking into filing a claim with the Attorney General to recoup my loss. If you purchase one of these chairs, be prepared to find yourself in the same situation we are presently in."
4,A 14 - Year Old's Review,"While I was reading this book, I was surprised by how many struggles children with disabilities have to overcome. I learned many things about life by reading this book. If you are a person interested in learning about challenges, life struggles, and happy endings, your in for a treat."
3,A Mind Opening Experience,"Samantha Abeel not only wrote My Thirteenth Winter, but lives it. This book opens up your eyes and makes you aware of the stuggles that thousands of people go through.Samantha went through many depressing moments throughout her educational life. Most of the dicouraging times were due to a learning disability that was not discovered until after her life had been negatively affected by it. Samantha was bewildered by the fact that she could be so skilled in writing but drop to rock bottom when it came to math skills. Her social life was a struggle. Each day was another not to enjoy, but push through and finish. Even when her learning disability was discovered, Samantha was oblivious to the fact that her life still had more secrets to reveal and challenges to overcome. This book offered a realistic perspective as to what people with learning diabilites go through. My Thirteenth Winter really shows an indepth look into the lives that many people live."
4,True and compelling story told with wisdom beyond her years.,"Samantha Abeel is a wonderful writer who has a special talent for making words come to life. As a teacher who teaches thirteen-year-olds, this book made me even more aware of the struggles some of my students must face everyday as they are asked to complete tasks that many don't even have to think about before completing them. Anyone who teaches, works with children, or has a family member who is learning disabled would benefit from reading this book! Her way with words is magical and makes the reader feel as if Samantha is there, speaking to the reader.There are so many passages in the book that I just had to highlight and share with others. I plan on sharing this book with other teachers and friends and I'm sure my copy of the book will be worn out before I get it back! Thanks Samantha for opening my eyes and the eyes of so many others to the difficulties some people face daily with your story."
5,"Good, but costs more than the whiskey!","Someone gave me a little sampler package of this, and it IS excellent coffee. But thirty bucks for less than a pound of it seems a little steep--the whiskey doesn't cost that much!"
3,Dakota Alert Cable Alarm,"Some of the local Gun Shows are now requiring security devices for firearms on sellers tables, and that's a good thing. I decided to go with the Dakota unit because of its low cost. The unit works well and is very useable, however the cables that come with it are very poor quality. One of my cables was defective out of the box. I recommend replacing the cables with better quality ones."
1,Disappointing,"Bought the TV, had new digital HDTV cable installed, spent half a day re-wiring and moving all my other components, plugged the TV in, and was so disappointed I almost kicked it. The picture is totaly fuzzy and the colors are dull. I messed with the settings called Viewsonic support, no help, the picture just remains lousy.I tried a DVD with my progressive scan DVD player and the picture was misarable.For sure the unit won't work as a computer monitor.Don't waste your money or time on this one."
2,Im not happy,"Im sure the other guys were impressed with this unit .Im not.If you can manage to get the picture bright enough be prepared to hear a nice loud humming sound!!Ive used it with all connections tried.Even with the 17 pin connect to my comp it was dissapointing and the sound from any white background is disgraceful!Forget about burn in as well.Its going to happen..Youd better spend the extra money and not cheap out as I did..I kept Myself to spending under 10 thousand bucks to redo my room ,this is just for electronics.I use it for my bedroom cause of lack o space.My SONY bigscreen is best pic Ive seen so far.Ill save my cash and get a sony plasma next..Oh and the heat is insane,No one mantioned this so I doubt if they truly even bought one.I wish I wasnt first to get this TV no reviews were out back then..."
3,whatever,misarable? ha.a fuzzy plasma t.v.??????? Maybe you should have got grandma to help. that way you wouldn't have dropped it. maybe that's why it's fuzzy
1,GAY LEATHER DISCO,"The first time I heard this record I hated it. Now, four years after I bought it, I still hate it. It reminds me of fingernails scraping down a blackboard, with a cheesemachine drum beating pumping out music for the Blue Oyster Club. Keep pumping the hits out your Fairbrass."
2,Silly novelty stuff,"""I'm too sexy"" was a funny novelty song for a while, until it got used in, oh, about a thousand ads and movies. If you can forget all of the media overkill, this ""song"" (actually, it's basically just the lead vocalist talking over a MOR dance beat) is still fun once in a while as a novelty song.The rest of the album is nothing but filler."
4,I lost my cherry to this cd!,"This cd will forever be one of the greatest of all time, because I lost my virginity to a wonderfull man in a club in the Castro district. Our eyes met in the club and he asked me to dance, the song happened to be I'm to sexy. We freaked out on the dancefloor and he invited me over to his place. I went, knowing what was about to take place. We went inside and he put in the Right Said Fred cd and he proceded to do things to me I've only dreamed of my chilhood priest doing to me. Buy this classic if you don't own it."
5,A really fun album from start to finish,"Right Said Fred are a fun band and that's that. When I first bought this album I had very low expectations, I figured they would have one good song and that'd be it. But I was very suprised at how great this album is. It's now years later and I still find it in my rotation of favorite discs. Richard Fairbrass has a remarkably good voice. If you are in the mood for a fun dancy album, you'll love it. I will agree with everyone who says that ""I'm Too Sexy"" was overplayed, but the rest of the album is worth some play as well."
3,Still feels good,"When this came out it was largely thought of as a toss-off, a novelty album. But you know what? There are some GREAT tracks on here, songs that are perfect for driving to the beach during the summer, cuts that definitely have a buoying effect if you need a mood lift. Amazing that they still sound good after all these years."
1,deeply dreadful,"I can honestly say that Deeply Dippy remains my most loathed pop single of all time, with Don`t Talk Just Kiss a runner-up.Deeply Dippy is a love song with no love, no heart, no soul, no sincerity. RSF are all camp, no substance. They hark back to thevapid archness of Spandau & Human League yet manage to be EVEN WORSE!With so much great music out there, why does anyone bother with stuff like this? One`s mind boggles."
5,yep!!!,"This is the best book i have found on drawing the head. Andrew loomis has a good method as well, I have kind of started using a hybrid of the 2. This book has a lot of information about different kinds of head shapes that occur in humans that I have not seen elsewhere."
4,Not for pure beginners or kids,"Mr Hogarth was a fantastically talented and immensely intelligent person and artist.Unfortunately his books are not for the newest of the new or hobby artists.Unless your kid is a genius, the book is not for youngsters.Hogarth's books are probably better for people who can already draw and want to improveand those with a lot of time to practice/digest the information in the books."
3,the head,I have two other books by this artist. I paint mostly female faces and will have to adapt them from the male..mostly male drawings..to a more feminine face..this will be the challenge..but construction wise they are somewhat the same..only smaller bone structure. Very practical book in an artists library.
4,Great Addition to my Library,Great Book. If you are an artist I could not understand why you do not have it in your library.
3,Ok for measurements but not for technique,"Burne Hogarth takes you through his technique of measuring human proportions. Beware, at times you will feel less like an artist and more like a mathmatician. Hogarths work is better suited to my sculpture than my drawing as he tends to show all the planes in his work as very defined surfaces. For a beginner trying to draw you can do a lot better."
3,Somewhat helpful,This book was not as helpful as I hoped. A good addition to a library but not all inclusive.
4,"Generally useful, avoids some obvious pitfalls","Although taking a formal course of study in human anatomy will give you greater depth in drawing the human head as far as proportion is concerned, this book does go into more depth than a course would in terms of facial features.Burne is of the old school in the sense that he probably learned such terms as ""dolichocephalic"" and ""brachiocephalic"" in the earlier part of this century, when these labels were commonly applied to ethnic groups. But he ably avoids this obsolete view by demonstrating these head types have examples in a variety of racial and ethnic groups.This very variety of ethnic facial examples is the greatest strength of the book. I've seen too many comic books try to portray a multi-cultural cast without knowing how!"
4,"Decent enough, glad I bought it","As another reader said, I'm not particularly fond of Hogarth's style, but this is a useful book (for what it covers). Content is limited in breadth, but goes into good depth on multicultural features and aging. I would have liked to see more examples of females, though, especially aged female faces."
1,HEY! EMI... WHY DON'T YOU MAKE A FEW MORE?,"Hey, EMI, why don't you make a few more for us guys who didn't discover this on time. Is that fair? LATER:......... PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FINDING THIS REVIEW HELPFUL. C'MON PEOPLE, KEEP VOTING THIS REVIEW HELPFUL, OR WRITE YOUR OWN, TO GET THIS BACK IN PRINT"
5,Brokop Breakout,"Lisa's voice is great, with its own distinctive quality and an accent perfect for country. Excellent album. The songs:Take That - Snazzy guitar, good drum beat, nice word play on ""take that"" as if spiting someone and then telling him to take girlfriend's letterOne of Those Nights - good gental love song to her guyYou Already Drove Me There - about love dyingGive Me a Ring Sometime - song about contemplation of marriage, has a good beat and various guitar riffs.Little Girls Dream - good tuneNever Did Say Goodbye - one of the few weaker tunesWho Needs You - lively and spirited, begins as a retort to a guy, then about a fight, then about making upNot Here in My Arms - slower tune, but powerfully sung, guy not to run to singer for comfortLet Me Live Another Day - the other weaker songNever Gonna Be Your Fool Again - good, steady beat. Uses clever lyrics to Tell a guy off who cheated."
5,Nikki from Philly loves Lisa,"Anything that Lisa does, she does with finesse and style. She has the voice of an angel that will set your soul afire. Do your music collection a favor, and get this CD."
2,Disappointing,"For the reviewer who stated that this is just one long, drawn-out ad for Brand Jordan - he is absolutely correct.Jordan and Co. talk more about the creation of his shoes (and his clothing line) more than he does about what made him his fame and fortune in the first place - his sterling basketball career.Without Jordan dominating on the court, and winning six NBA titles, these shoes would never be the big sellers that they are - thus not allowing Michael to justify speaking of the process of making them. Why would shoes from a sub-par player have much appeal?Just as the title states - extremely disappointing."
5,Magnificent,"This is an outstanding book in two ways. It covers branding and building a product but it also deals with motivation.The book goes into great detail about MJ and his strong desire to have a product that reflected him. His resistance of corporate input to insist his shoes be to his liking...and his success in this.It is also filled with quotes about what helped make Michael so good in basketball.A wonderful insightful, motivational book."
3,Pretty good,The product came in a timely fashion and delivery was not a problem. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the book when it came. The inside was nice but the outside jacket looked as if the book had been used. I don't know if it moved around a lot in shipping but it did not have the newest look.
3,Very interesting,"Good book, nothing explosive or amazing but overall very interesting.I would rank other books about/by Jordan as more informative and entertaining than this one, but would still recommend this for the right price."
4,Excellent reading,It is great to read what the best had gone trough growing up and how much parents and people around do contribute to one's life.
5,Great insight into the greatest athlete of my lifetime,"Driven from Within provides great insight into how Michael Jordan found success on and off the basketball court. While it goes into a lot of detail about the design work behind his famous shoes (some people did not like that), I enjoyed hearing about his hard work and dedication to every challenge he faced in life. I took great inspiration from learning about his competitive drive and will to be the best."
1,was that a book or shoes advertisement?,i was waiting to read some things to help me get to know mj's psychology and way of thinking.unfortunately the pages concerning that were minimum and the book is a long winded advertisement.Embarrasing and dissapointing
1,"Brand Jordan, Brand Jordan, Brand Jordan, Brand Jordan","That's all this book cares about it. They use the words Brand Jordan constantly. We all know he is the most fierce competitor, the hardest worker, best dresser, etc. I finished this book in two short sittings. It's mostly pictures of his Air Jordan sneakers. A huge dissapointment, I am returning it!!!"
1,Not what I expected,"At the price offered I expected to get four of these. I got that impression due to the fact that other offerings of similar products come in sets of four. I got one, and the total cost including shipping came to almost eleven dollars. It's a little piece of plastic for holding playing cards. I returned the item for lack of value. I would expect them to be available in toy stores for around 99 cents apiece...not $10.50."
2,OUCH! DUETS HAVE SOUNDED BETTER THAN THIS MESS!,"It's not that it's a terrible CD, a more apt description would be that it's cloying. They're voices are too similar and too high to mix all that interestingly on duets, the result sounds like two cats in heat, only two octave higher. The song choices aren't bad either, only their styles on this album make the songs sound too similar. I think that if their ranges were more disparate, it would have been a more successful project. It sounds like one of them is singing duets with herself. After the fifth song, we were getting headaches from these women and had to move on to more soothing music and some alcoholic beverages. Don't bother with this one."
5,beautiful pair,"I have been a fan of Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley since seeing them in ""Side Show"". They are two of theatre's greatest talents today, and this album is extraordinary. The songs and arrangements are great, and I listen to this album a lot!This CD has everything -- humor and drama -- it's great! Especially enjoyable is the ""hidden track"" at the end of the last song with ""bootlegged"" copies of Julie Andrews and Jennifer Holiday playing Daisy and Violet. Amazing and hilarious!If you enjoy this first CD, I would suggest picking up their second CD, ""Unsuspecting Hearts"" along with Emily Skinner's solo album. All three of these CDs are great interpretations of classic theatre songs. You won't be sorry to meet up with Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner!"
5,A Great CD for any collection!,"Both Skinner and Ripley were nominated TOGETHER for a Tony nomination in the best female category. Their individual talents, although terrific by themselves, are absolutely incredible joined together. Some great songs such as ""I Know Him So Well"" are worth the price of the CD by itself... other great songs include those cut out from Side Show. Drawbacks include the lack-luster orchestrations that sound like elevator musaak. But their voices definitely make up for it!"
5,Broadway Fan 4 Life!,"I first listened to Side Show and fell in love with it. As soon as the girls came out with their own CD, I purchased it immediately. Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley are fantastic performers."
5,PERFECT,"A lot has been said about this album and I agree, it's perfect !! Not only are their voices magical together, you can hear what a wondeful time the two had, recording this album, in every single song. Listening to it just makes me happy and that's what music's all about =) Can't wait for their next album to come out."
5,Alice and Emily have done it yet again...FABULOUS.,"Three cheers for Alice and Emily. Not only have they captured all of the theatre goers hearts with their tony award nomination performance of ""Side Show"", but now this beautiful album. These two women could probably work together and make any broadway flop a big success. Alice and Emily are two of broadways greatest new actresses. They will definately become legens like Mary Martin and Carol Channing. Any broadway buff would be greatly mistaken to not have this album as part of their collection"
2,Not my favorite,I have very small wrists and the bracelet was very large. It wasn't as cute as I thought it would be and it fit awkwardly. I returned this product. I do not suggest if you have small wrists.
3,Dull Stones,"This is a nice bracelet, but the stones are very dull, not shiny like most onyx stones I have. I would actually question if it's onyx or just some kind of black chip bead. I really don't know, but I don't really care for the dullness of the stone because it doesn't match my true onyx jewelry when I try to wear them together."
2,Clarks voice is great but this CD isn't .,"I've been a long time fan of Petula Clark even though she was popular a little before my time. I bought this CD when I saw it in the store and noticed it was done by the people who produced Helen Reddy's new ""Center Stage"" CD which I reaaly liked. I bought ""Here for You"" without listening first and was just a little dissapointed. This collection has some good tracks but only a few. I think I wanted more stuff in the style of ""Oxygen"" from her ""Treasure's"" CD from around 1990. What I got was an odd mix of songs including ""Pinball Wizard"" which is just too weird to listen to. If you're a big fan of Petula Clark you will probably really enjoy it. Otherwise get one her ""Greatest Hits"" and save some money."
3,Under Siege Deux,"The Score For Under Siege is a fair and good one. Poledouris uses a blend of a full orchestra and heavy synth music for this album. But a good mix goes great for this score. The first track is a brassy, powerfull patriotic theme. For the rest is a mixture of orchestra and synth.Mainly the CD is chase music. Which some score fans don't like. But I enjoy most of this CD. The almost powerful victory theme at the end of the CD is great but flawed by a gospel song that Segal even wrote himself. For the exception of this, this CD is worth 4 stars."
1,The box does not represent the product description,"The box shows it being of the 12, 3""x 3 yards type. What you get are 50, 3x15"" strips which is 16 yards less then the box shown. It's a gross misrepensentation of the product."
5,essential,"Of course it sounds dated, but ""Very"" remains the quintessential Pet Shop Boys album. It's hysterically melodramatic - at a shrieking, fever pitch - and can still be exhausting to listen to, but is so accomplished you have to marvel at how they did it. An essential addition to any collection."
4,VERY good album,"This is an excellent album by a superb pop duo, Pet Shop Boys. My personal favorites are Can You Forgive Her?, Dreaming of the Queen, Yesterday..., To Speak is a Sin, One in a Million and, of course, the irresistable Go West. It has been said that this is the PSB's finest work. I am in the minority that prefers Bilingual. Different strokes for different folks. I find I have to be in a certain mood to listen to this CD. Nevertheless, I certainly don't regret buying this album and encourage others to do the same. Go West!"
1,THIS IS THE WRONG ALBUM,"This is NOT (Very+)!!!! It is Bilingual. Amazon has been informed of this (over a month ago) and has not fixed the entry. If you order this, you will get Bilingual and NOT Very+!!You have been warned!!Don't believe me? Then listen to the tracks. They ARE NOT what Amazon lists."
2,Very alright,"2 1/2PSB's consistent electro-melodies yield a slight timeless quality amidst plasticized programmings, but it all sounded a little too shallowly self-contained for me."
5,ONE OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES,I'M CURRENTLY ON MY THIRD COPY OF THIS DISC....I'M SURPRISED THAT NOT A SINGLE PERSON HAS COMMENTED ON THE LITTLE DITTY THAT CHRIS SINGS ON THE HIDDEN TRACK THATS BURRIED AT THE END OF THE DISC AFTER GO WEST.
4,Underrated Gem,"This album, released in 1993, is solid all the way through. Standout songs are the Village People-cover ""Go West"", ""Yesterday When I Was Mad"" & ""One In One Make Five"". This particular album is very unique too because of the CD case it came in (Lego-like). This Pet Shop Boys album is on a published list of 1001 Albums Every Person Needs to Hear Before They Die, I would agree with that statement."
4,Scary Music,"This Pet Shop Boys album is produced excellently and recorded amazingly. The vocals are high and clear. The melodies are easy to recognize and very popular. The theme of unrequieted young love is sad and confusing, but very deep and emotional. The subject matter is dangerously romantic, and some what ambiguous. Overall an engaging disc with an intense pop beat."
5,The Title Says It All,"This dance music classic is the cream of the crop for the nineties. Intelligent, romantic, melancholy, bittersweet-these guys move your heart and soul as well as your feet. Life's too short not to give this a listen."
4,Barbeque Bible,"As a ""newbie"" in the barbeque/smoking area, I wanted a book with basic explanations of why long slow cooking with smoke makes such tasty treats as ribs, pork butt, chicken etc. My family unanimously like my first attempt at ribs, terming it ""better than anything they had eaten at any restaurant"". I based what my cooking process on the advice from this book, finding it simple and straightforward. I think most folks will have similar results if they have a decent smoker. The hard part is choosing seasonings (rubs in particular) so I did hit the local bbq store and buy their recommended rub, but I really think choosing the right wood is just as important as seasoning. There are lots of recipies for rubs and ideas on how to adjust them.PS - The stories about competing professionally are worth reading too!"
5,El Sermon del Monte,"It is an excellent book, that shows the really meaning of God and the word of Jesus. It really helps people trying to improve their spirituality."
5,El Sermón del Monte (Spanish Edition) or Sermon on the Mount,A Spanish version of Sermon on the Mount. Great take on Matthew 5 & 6 & 7 and The Lord's Prayer.
5,this book is the perfect bridge to various distressed areas,"i looked long and hard to find this book and it was worth the time and effort. it is simply written, as many investment books are not, and it segues into the different areas a value/contrarian is concerned about. most books dwell on a particular aspect of investing-low p/e, value, bankruptcy etc. to the exclusion of the others. this book brings all these areas together and discusses them cohesively in a meaningful manner. the author does much of the leg work: ie. providing a bankruptcy prediction model by a noted professor. to look back at the list of bankrupt companies of the 80's was an eye opener to how lucrative this type of investing could be. an excellent, clear, meaningful book. i recommend it highly!"
1,"Too buggy, don't forget to install retail patch!! :(",I'm a software programmer and this type of beta testing on consumers makes me feel ill and gives our trade a bad name. This version has patches that must be applied to work properly. I think there might be a new version for which is worth searching.
2,"Cool thing to be able to do, but...","There are still some bugs, such as...if you add music to your slideshows, you cannot manually go forwards or backwards while watching. You have to either wait until it finishes playing or hit the eject button because stop and pause do not work. Also, you can't have more than 2 pages on your main menu screen, if so, your dvd player won't recognize the cd you just made. I've tried this so many times, with different options selected. It got 2 stars because it was super easy to learn. Otherwise it would have been 0 stars."
2,Eh! Well beyond it's prime now...,"This was a great tool years ago, but Ulead got bought by Corel and now they only offer a full DVD image/video packaged named DVD MovieFactory with much more capabilities.Corel DVD MovieFactory 6.0 Plus"
5,Great Quality,"The quality and finish on these extensions were really nice. These were inexpensive, but worked flawlessly. They fit my sockets really snug (not to tight just perfect.) The only downside is they don't having the knurled surface like the GearWrench extensions do, to grip with your fingers to turn them quicker then a ratchet, but you could pick up some thin grip tape for them to be just as good.5/5"
4,Exactly what I needed,The quality of the extensions are great. They are very sturdy and they fit my socket wrench perfectly. Highly recommended.
3,Not the best Muppet vehicle,"I'm not sure that this book has upheld the high standards of the Muppet franchise. The moral lesson and cute characters are there, but the entertainment value seems to be a bit compromised.Each page has a lot of words, and the action is pretty slow-paced. Basically, Fozzie makes plans with Kermit, but Kermit blows him off and then denies that their plans were for that day at all. This makes Fozzie angry, but he's not sure of the best way to handle this emotion. He and Kermit eventually have a resolution in the form of a discussion in which Kermit admits his mistake and their great friendship endures. This is a positive model for a realistic situation that children might face, but I think it needed more humor to lighten up the preachiness."
3,A Smooth and Solid Pick,"There is something about this collection that really gives you the sense that the band was in a good mellow mood throughout the concert. There is a tight consistency that runs through every track. This is a set that is very easy to listen to, with a few excellent moments, but lacks any truly memorable versions of their best songs. I'm glad I bought it, but I'm a tough grader and so it doesn't quite make 4 stars. That being said, the sound quality is terrific, and I disagree with the fellow who says that the mix is bad or that you can't hear Bob Weir."
4,not best 1973 era release,"This cd's recoeding quality starts of shaky but does fall into a good groove soon. The set list is basic but lacks some of the better 1973 songs in my opinion. The playing is crisp, but not particularly remarkable for this finest era of Dead music ('72-'74). I would recommend any of the other releases from '73 before this one...although this is still a good show."
5,The one show to own,"Dark Star made this worth every penny, but the rest of the show is good too. I love 1973 shows for their easy, balanced, spacey groove. Some call it the ""honey year"", whatever that means, but I guess it fits. This collection in particular exemplifies how musically together the Dead were in 1973. It falls between their roadhouse rocking of 71, their country rocking of 72, and their jazzy jamming of 74. The boundaries were down. Their improvisation was spiritual.Note: It took me a while before I ""got"" this band. Be a patient listener. These aren't 3 minute radio-pulp songs. The music is challenging (but oddly enough makes great background music). When these guys get into their groove, some amazing music happens."
1,Can I rate it minus one?,I attended this show.Horrible and BORING. Only deadheads would drink the kool-aid and believe this was anything more than trivial drug-induced noodling.Quit attempting to appear cool and wake up. These guys are the most over-rated performers in music history next to Thag banging on dried out tree stumps in his cave in Mesopotamia.
3,Suprisingly good,Not a Bad film at all. a new and fresh cast was what made all the differnce seeing new faces in the movie scene through Chang and Vir Das. Anoushka sharma as always was a stunner playing her role well as did Shahid kapoor.
3,GoodGora Reviews Badmaash Company,"It is a movie about changing morals, the urgency to get rich now at any cost and the personal cost to those who live that life. Unfortuneately, this story will be lived over and over in many people's lives and maybe not as good of an outcome."
4,La Mejor Interprete De Marco- Marisela,"Marco Antonio Solis is a great song writer and a fair singer. But Marisela brings his songs to life. On this album she hits high notes that Marco can only imagine. Marisela's voice is made for tunes like ""Ya no te vayas"", ""Sin el"", ""Si no te hubieras"", and ""Solo con mi soledad"". Marco Antonio has obviously written these songs with Marisela in mind. This is great Mexican style rock, without ranchero influence. The album pumps right along. If you like Marisela, you'll love this one. My only lament is that Marisela does not sing all of Marco Antonio's songs she's recorded here. And I wish she would do a whole album of duets with Marco."
3,Good start to terrible series,"These three first books are the best in the series. After that it goes downhill fast with endless complications and extremely tedious and convoluted plots. But these first books are fun and make a nice romp. If you want to read a complete story, then I would strongly advise you not to start this series.Robert Jordan got greedy and betrayed his readers. The only downside of buying any book by Jordan is that you encourage such behavior."
2,For an opposing view...,"Let me preface by saying that I liked THIS book. It was well written with intriguing characters, good plot, and some interesting ideas. But the books that follow are simply terrible.The world is flat, with little to distinguish cultures. Religion is one-sided (with all the fear of the Dark One, why is there NO church to the Creator?) The characters are annoying at best, stereotypical at worst, with sexist overtones. (Female mages, for want of a better word, get their power by being passive and receptive, males by being aggressive and dominating it, etc.)I quit reading the series somewhere in the 6th book. I kept hoping that Jordan would do something that showed the promise of the first book, but it doesn't seem likely. The reason for the praise that is lavished on this series is beyond me, but to each their own!"
5,My Favorite Fantasy Adventure!,"This story has so captured my imagination that I find myself wanting the next book to be published 'yesterday'. Others had compared it to LOTR, but I disagree, it is a story apart! Some think it drags, but for me this was NOT True. I recommend this for anyone who likes to 'get away' and travel in a different world!"
3,Robert Jordan Boxed Sets,"Please refer to my other reviews of the Robert Jordan boxed sets, which was the only way, besides Kindle, to get book one; info on publishing lingo should be part of the data when buying a paperback so it is obvious (without searching for dimensions) the sizes of the books, which in this case considering the length of the books, makes them impossible to handle with any limitations in hand use; the small size means small print, as well, which with aging eye-sight, is also a problem; I've read the series before and was disappointed in the inconsistent quality of the story, but in general, I have enjoyed this series"
5,A great fantasy story,"Rand, Perrin, and Mat of the Two Rivers farming and sheep-herding community promise to be as enthralling as Bilbo and Frodo. Since Rand and Perrin are what Joseph Campbell would have called heroes with blemishes, the long series promises to be riveting and archetypal."
4,Wheel of time,I have yet to finish the first book but I am enjoying it. I would recommend this for fans of fantasy books.
4,"Good quality, good product","I love the books, I read them about a year and a half ago, and now am purchasing them to read again, and to keep. The box sets are good quality, although more easily roughed up than I would expect. They come in a very thin box, so the actual box isn't anything you would expect to keep around, either. Otherwise, definitely a good buy."
4,Enough already,"This boxed set is excellent as is boxed set #2. The writing is superb; The characters mesmerizing. I also like a good epic fantasy. However, as you get into boxed set #3 it starts getting so verbose that you can skip three pages at a time while he describes a particular dress in agonizing detail. And that's just one dress! If there are five women in the room skip about 15 pages! I started reading these in my forties. I am now in my fifties and worried that I won't live to find out the ending! Personally, I don't think he has one and maybe never will because now, apparently, he's started a new series. Aaarrrgghhh!"
5,Completely Addictive,"I have read Tolkien,Heinlen, Herbert,Donaldson, Eddings and a great many others. This series by Jordan is by far the best and worst I've ever read. The characters are so well developed that you can imagine what they are thinking even when it's not printed. The world so clearly rendered, that you see, smell, hear, and feel it rather than read about it. Yet unlike other books, there are no filler pages. Everything in the story, from the first scene to the last, is important and will come back to haunt you. I absolutely love this series. I have and will read it again and again. The thing that makes it the worst is the eternity between books. Until this series is complete, and my guess is ten or eleven books, every other book I read will only be a place holder."
5,"A Great, Epic Fantasy Novel","The depth at which Robert Jordan describes his world leaves the reader in awe. The second book in his epic fantasy series, the Wheel of Time, the Great Hunt is little more than astounding. The characters are extremely well developed, and the very world is so clearly defined.I've been a long-time fan of the Wheel of Time series, having fallen in love since I laid hands on the first book of this series, the Eye of the World, to the point that I have come to administer a website based upon the series( [...] ), and become a member of several others, including [...] and [...]. This is a series that never stops tugging at your imagination. I highly recommend it."
5,The Wheel of Time is fantastic,My son recommended this series to me as it was one of his favorites and I was looking for something new to read. I was not disappointed. The first book brought me in and held my attention by the first two chapters. I spent a few nights staying up way past my bedtime because I just couldn't put the book down. If you like science fiction fantasy then you should enjoy this series.
4,Captivating start,"I breezed through boxed set #1. Jordan has created a colorful, interesting world with a rich history. I *really* like how he has different agendas clash in unexpected ways, so that four distinct evil plans mostly cancel each other out. Character development in terms of new skills was good. Sure, Rand becomes powerful, but he's not quite flying around the world wearing a cape and tights, and he still can be foolish."
3,Ho hum,"Obviously this is very subjective.What I really didn't like about the book is the immense amount of detail that needs to be absorbed BEFORE any action occurs. I find it difficult to care about the characters if all that is going on are beautifully, detailed descriptions of the world.I find that starting a story with an exciting action scene makes reading the details fun rather than an investment.Cheers,Marc"
1,Evil,"1 star is too high for this. It should be rated ""Stay away, it's horrible"". This movie is the epitome of false advertising. The name is misleading and the video is misleading. It's not really about the MET at all. There are token amounts of the museum in it, but it's primarily about showing kids evil, demons, and how to become a star in the night sky. This is really satanic and is inexcusable to foist this on unsuspecting children (and parents)."
5,Could Not Be Better,"Everything OK, Great Disk, better than other Carnegie Hall versions.Packaging was also very good.Would always buy again.ThanksPeter."
5,complete benny goodman,Music to put pep in your step and zip in your day I had heard it before and knew it waswhat i wantedand it arrived in good time
5,Excellent music and sound,"I'm glad there are both versions of this concert available. I haven't heard the other version, but this one straight out sounds great. This is the version to get if you want a set that doesn't sound ""old""."
5,Benny Goodman Carnegie Hall Concert 1938,The CD was a gift for my 95 year old father in law. He loved it. The quality was outstanding.
5,Lovin Goodman,"What a great concert,oh to have been there live. But this recording is the next best thing. Well done."
4,Better than expected,"I am one of those people who finds it too distracting to listen to the original recording of this concert.But this version by Jasmine is fantastic. Most of the songs are DRAMATICALLY improved. If you like the 1938 Carnegie Hall concert, you'll be surprised at how much better this album sounds.balalalala"
1,VIRTUAL FOOTBALL,"The virtual football that we ordered was sent w/ a corroded battery compartment. I made numerous attempts to email/ contact the Carolina Toy Dept. & no one has responded. This is extremely frustrating to me considering how excited my son was to play w/ this toy after he opened it on Xmas morning. In addition, I paid almost $40 for this toy that I should have just thrown down the drain. I will never again order from Amazon or Carolina Toy Dept."
3,Only works half the time,"I bought 3 of these footballs (one for each nephew) and one of them didn't work at all. The other two only work half the time, giving distances that are impossible for an 8-year-old boy. I'm not bothering to return them because luckily they are scarlet and gray so they work as play footballs for our nephews who are all Ohio State fans."
2,dried out his hair,"Kid with long curly hair, lots of tangles.... this product got the tangles out but dried his hair out in process. Stopped using after a week, no one wants dry brittle hair."
4,Great Acessory!!,Races of Eberron has added depth to the new races presented in the campaign setting plus offers insight into the standard races from the PHB and their culture (per the Eberron Setting). It also offers new spells and racial feats.Races of Eberron is great for those playing in the Eberron campaign setting or looking to spice up another setting.
1,It'll rip easily.,The material ripped on me after 2 uses. I was very disappointed. No grip at all. I won't recommend this to anyone.
4,one of the best singles comps ever,"""dead leaves"" could easily be an album and not a singles comp...i wore this one out folks. the near tone deaf deadpan semi-snarky vocaling of richard balaut (sp?) and fontaine toupes (sp?) is truly something to behold. they were also quite the live show...4 tin foil stars."
4,"Demanding listening, but worth the effort.","Although I suppose I do fault her for the total absence of humor here, there's no denying it anymore: Harvey is a major artist, a true iconoclast whose artistry puts most pop musicians to shame. She refuses to delute or prettify her image or her material for the marketplace and thus will never sell as many records as say, Sheryl Crow. But that's America's loss, not hers. If anything, these songs are even bleaker than those on her last album, evoking both Greek tragedy and biblical parable (sometimes in the same song).On songs like ""Catherine"" and ""The Wind,"" she creates soundscapes that are unsettling in a way pop music often tries to be but almost never is. This is truly scary stuff, but often heartbreakingly beautiful as well...Have I made a sale yet? Personal to PJ: I anxiously await the proposed Tricky collaboration!"
4,Another beautifully crafted album!,"Is This Desire is a great album. I only gave it four stars because it lacks the emotion and integrity that To Bring You My Love had. I enjoy PJ Harvey's roughness, such as on Long Snake Moan. This is no where to be found on this album. The lyrics aren't as ambigious as To Bring You My Love. This is a little different than I am used to from PJ, but it is still excellent!"
4,THROW YER PAIN IN TH RIVER,"it seems i'm not th only one that resisted fallin in love with this album: i mean th samplin n distortion on some songs, plus at first no one song really grabs you(except th river), upon closer inspection, however, everything changes.. from th first note on ""angeline"" to th last breath of ""is this desire?"" th album is close as you get to a 'modern' rock masterpiece! cathartic dark blues told with a poetic swagger not found this side of pop culture; sophisticated(maybe even progressive), never less than completely authentic, i can go on n on.. its hard to read criticism on this album, i wish these people would just say they dont understand.. because,just like life, art isnt for everybody"
3,heartbreaking,"I expected so much more from PJ Harvey after the breathtaking offerings produced thus far, but this album seems myred in the same sort of groove as the last album. It was original and spectacular in the last album. Here it is just repetition. This album has no catchy songs, nothing that holds my interest or attention. Sad."
5,Polly Jean has got it going again,"I didn't like ""To bring you my love"", but this is a return in my opinion to the soulful bleeding heart on sleeve and mesmerizing lyric PJ that so many of us loved on ""Dry"" and ""Rid of Me"". Of course, absent the guitars we all love, but the melodies I think are BETTER than the last release and the dark moods more subtle, artful and intriguing. Great head candy from one of the greatest."
4,Uneven but brilliant,"The bad news: there's some weaker songwriting here, like the silly ""The Wind"" and a few cold biscuits from the ""To Bring You My Love"" era (the unbearably ugly ""Joy"").But several of PJ's most revelatory songs appear here too. ""The Sky Lit Up"" and ""No Girl So Sweet"" explore her overdrive gear; ""Angelene"" and ""Electric Light"" are lovely slow burners; the diamond here is ""A Perfect Day Elise,"" which filters the stuttering guitar of ""Four-Track Demos"" through a delicious electronic dance-floor haze. Irreplaceable music at its best, and a crucial transition to the mature work on ""Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea."""
3,Great because it's PJ.But doesn't live up to her past stuff.,"PJ Harvey can hardly touch anything without it being genius. And Is This Desire has a bunch of genius in it. It also has her very large voice. But what it doesn't have is the emotional power and range of her past stuff. It doesn't rock like '50 ft. Queenie' or 'Snake'. It doesn't give you the emotional peaks and valleys like 'Send His Love To Me' or 'Sheela-Na-Gig' No boubt, that compared to alot of the other #$@* out there right now, this is monumental. But compared to past PJ work, it's just kind of ho-hum."
5,Pure beauty,"If this is Desire, then give me some more! Eagerly awaited, PJ Harvey's new album is just pure,strong beauty. There's actually impossible to pick one song to list as ""the best track"" as all of them are magnificent. The mood on the album might in some ways resemble the one on ""To bring you my love"", and those of you who got totally addicted to that album, are destined to get hooked on this one as well. ""Is this Desire"" is the best album so far this year, and I have only one more thing to say: Buy it. Now!"
5,Is this not a masterpiece?,"After a pretty dull year in music, PJ Harvey has released what may just be the best release of 1998. I have played this cd everyday since I purchased it on September 29th. It just gets better with each listen. It's hard to pick a favorite track, but I'd say ""The Garden"" may just be one of the best and haunting tracks I've ever heard from any artist. I've been a fan of PJ Harvey since her debut cd, ""Dry"". She is artisticly in my opinon the best female singer in music today. She also plays a wicked guitar. I could gush all night about Polly Jean, but I'll just say this... If you're not a fan of her music, please give it a try. You'll love it! ""Is This Desire"" is truely a masterpiece. The best release of 1998!"
4,pretty good,"If i would have to sum up this album in one word it would be ""interesting"" - theres alomst not a dull moment in the cd - with each song sounding different from the other. There are quiet moody songs like ""catherine"" along with disquieting powerful songs such as ""joy"". All in all it is a very good cd, but if comparing to the other pj harvey cd I have - To bring you my love - i would say this lacks the raw emotion in that cd, maybe because it seems as if pj is just singing other peoples feelings and not her own, and maybe a bit too much experimental. BUT none the less - recommended!"
3,Daring but disappointing,"Polly Jean Harvey has taken a new direction on this album, and she deserves to be commended for it. However, this is not her strongest effort. She has abandoned the grand theatrics of her previous works for a more subdued approach that is not entirely successful. There is a disappointing sameness about a lot of the songs, and far too much reliance on occasionally intrusive synthesisers. However, it's a P.J Harvey album, which makes it better than 99% of the stuff out there (Alanis Morrissete et al, we're talking about you)."
2,Dissapointed,"Like some of the other reviewers I should have paid more attention before I bought. I am unsure how this is titled ""Original Soundtrack"". Most of the cuts from the movie are not even on here. Especially my favorite which was a very nice tune that came after the soldier rescued the guy during the wind storm (right before the carrot cutting scene). Major dissapointment for me. The cuts (only 8) on the CD are good, but I would not have bought it had I known."
3,Loud & Militant,"For the movie ""Soldier"", composer Joel McNeely composed a (not surprisingly) very militant sounding score. Utilizing a heavy dose of brass and snare drums, ""Soldier"" is definately not for those seeking a rousing, thematic and inspiring soundtrack. Instead, it would appeal more to those who appreciate militant and action-oriented music. If I had to compare this score to another simply for the sake of trying to describe its music, I would have to say ""Aliens"". Some of the big action sequences in ""Soldier"" sound somewhat similar to that of ""Aliens"". Before recommending you buy this score, however, I must warn you to see the movie first. Fans of the film will undoubtedly appreciate the score better than those who hated it."
3,Missing Tracks From the Movie,"As was said before, the CD is missing tracks from the movie, I was looking for Monster Magnet's ""Powertrip"" which plays during the closing credits, but its not on the soundtrack... Pretty much limited to Joel McNeely's work--which is good--its not really a complete soundtrack."
5,This CD has been OPENNED and in EXCELLANT SHAPE,This Seller can be Trusted to sell CD'S that have been openned in Excellant Condition
2,SOUNDTRACK FOR SOLDIER,"You sent me the movie on DVD, you didn't send me the soundtrack to soldier. This is the first time I had an issue with an order, that's why I didn't complain.With Kindest Regards;John Dungy"
3,It was okay,I was not impressed with it. The information is very basic and no new ideas were presented.
1,Bad experience,Would not transfer pictures from Easyshare photos. Spent over 3 hours on phone with so called techs that were very hard to undertand. Poor english. Finally he said it needed to be sent back for repairs.
4,Good but video still lacking,"I bought this one to replace a much cheaper 7 inch KDS frame I bought for my wife's birthday. I was immediately impressed with the picture quality and the polished menus. It has 128 MB of internal memory which is plenty for holding just pictures.I wasn't impressed with the video, as this was one of the issues I had with the KDS. The video plays slow and the audio is choppy (probably trying to keep in time with the video). The videos were from my digital camera taken at 640x480. I didn't try smaller videos, so maybe it's a size thing. I have come to the conclusion that digital photo frames just don't do video very well in general.It can apparently play MP3's, but I didn't test that.All-in-all it is a high quality photo frame with a nice finish that is quite attractive. Don't expect it to do more than photos though."
2,My 2 cents,"Wow, I am very surprised to see this 3 yr old product still selling in the market. This was Kodak's product line from 2007. What surprises me even more is the price they are offering it at. These days, you could purchase a 8 inch digital photo frame under $80 at most dot coms and retailers."
2,Poor LCD Quality,"This is a beautiful frame, but it pretty much stops there. The LCD is bright with great contrast, but the vertical lines forced me to return the product. I like the frame so much I hoped that my first one was flawed, but after I exchanged it, it turns out to just be a poor quality LCD. Disappointed, I would have expected better quality from Kodak."
4,Digital picture frame,"The best yet that I have seen. The pictures are sharp and clear, easy to use. I'm going to be buying two for gifts and would recommend to any one that's interested."
4,Almost Perfect - Needs a Random Mode,"I liked everything about this frame except it has no method to randomly display your pictures. It displays them in the order you added them to the device - so if you have hundreds of pictures, you will always see the same pictures in the same sequence at start-up. This to me is a huge oversight and flaw - I would think that random would be the default display method for any digital picture frame.Aside from that the picture frame is great. The picture quality is outstanding and the interface is fairly easy to use."
1,"Disappointing, considering it's Kodak","Kodak is usually a trustworthy name for photo related products. However, this frame does not deliver. As some of the other reviews indicate, I've had problems with the resolution on pictures when viewed on the frame. Actually, one of my biggest complaints is that the software doesn't have a randomize or shuffle feature for your pictures. I suppose this is my fault for not researching better but I figured it was so basic that every frame would have it, but this frame doesn't, so if you slip a 1 or 2 gig card in the frame you'll have to go through every single picture in order. Without random, instead of the nice surprise, ""Oh, hey, remember that picture?"" it becomes like sitting through a relative's boring vacation slideshow."
2,Doesn't recognize any video formats,"Don't buy this for your videos because it failed to recognize any of the supported formats that were listed. I used both the e-mail and live chat support that Kodak offers and all they could suggest was to reload the firmware. It had the latest version, but I reloaded it anyway to no avail. The next suggestion was a 1-800 number to send it in for repairs, which wasn't available on Saturday morning at 9AM.Wouldn't recommend it."
1,Not happy,"This frame displays pictures ok. But DO NOT USE KODAK'S EASYSHARE SOFTWARE, your better off using windows to transfer files. Navigation using the buttons on the back of the frame don't make any sense, you have to use the remote to navigate. This frame is supposed to play .MOV .AVI .MPEG1 & .MPEG4 files .MOV files created with my Kodak Z812IS camera do not work on this frame, niether do .MPEG4 files. You can play .AVI & MPEG1 files 640 x 480 resolution."
1,False Advertizing,I purchased this picture frame primarily because it stated on the packaging that it played MPEG4 movies. Come to find out that it doesn't actually play/recognize them - at least not the files from my camera. Troubleshooting online revealed that many buyers have had the same problem. None have found an easy solution and only a few have been able to get the frame to work after jumping through a lot of hoops. This purchase was a huge disappointment.
5,Very easy to start,"This digital picture frame was very easy to use. I had it loaded from my PC and cycling pictures in about 15 minutes. I priced it at my local discount superstore, and saved about $30 buying it from Amazon."
4,Satisfied,"This is a good digital picture frame. It does more than I expected. The SV series does not have wifi. The EX series is the one that has it. If the EX does all that this frame can plus the wifi, I would go for the wifi. Clarity and picture image is good. My coworkers really like seeing my slideshows. So instead of dozens of frames of friends and family there is one rotating slideshow. It will even play music!"
1,Kodak Easyshare?,"This picture frame program is not worth the price. I would not buy it again. The documentation is less than minimal--very little help from the website.The product has easy share in the name--you would think EasyShare software would set up the slide show, but there is no ability to use Easyshare.I have several pictures that I loaded in a flashdrive (jpegs) that create an error message and are skipped for no apparent reason. The frame is formatted in fat 16, (Windows) even though it is advertised as Mac/PC. Unless you format SDs and flashdrives to DOS the frame cannot see the pictures on the drive. Nowhere in the documentation is this explained!"
4,"a great gift, but not completely user friendly","We bought this as a Christmas gift for our parents. They have really enjoyed it and say that the picture quality is fantastic, but they have had trouble figuring out how to play videos on it. They are still trying to figure it out...perhaps it just doesn't work with digital camera videos?"
1,Lots of Difficulties and the music option doesn't work,"After spending a good portion of the day working with the tech support, very poor support, hard to understand, following other links to upgrade firmware, etc. the music still will not download. Their responses to my requests for help were more surprising than the fact that the music feature doesn't work or I can't get it to work.Please shop for another brand."
3,"Works well, minor issues","The quality of the displayed image is wonderful. There are really only two or three minor issues. I gave it only three stars because there are frames for sale without these issues and I therefore would not buy this one again.First, there is no battery. My frame is hanging on the wall with a rather obvious wire hanging from it. Second, the wide screen aspect ratio while great for movies is not so great for pictures which are normally in more of a 4x6 format. Last, when the frame is hanging, the holder for the remote (which is a nice idea) becomes useless. This could have been designed better.That being said, it's nice to easily display my digital pics without having to print them first.Bottom line, I would look for a frame without wide screen and with a battery unless you are standing it on a desk rather than hanging it on a wall in which case the wire is more easily hidden."
4,Excellent frame,"The color and clarity on the frame are great. I love that you can use either a flash card or a flash drive. The only aspect I did not like was that it takes a while for you to learn how the controls work. They menu is not too user friendly and the instructions really do not help, so be ready to spend a good 15 minutes getting to know your frame. After that it works great."
2,Kodak Easyshare digital Photo frame,A friend of mine bought this for me while visiting New York. We live in South Africa. Unfortunately the frame does not work that well. We are using a 12v adapter to run the frame and it does not connect well to the actual digital photo frame. Therefore it constantly switches on and off. We are trying to chat with Kodak in South Africa to see if they can help us with this faulty frame. Otherwise I think it is a great product and when it works it is does exactly what is says on the box.
3,"Frame good, software would not load","The frame works well. The software would not load after many attempts and multiple patches downloaded from the support website. We have to use a work-around to load pictures. We load pictures to a memory card inserted in our laptop. Then we load to memory card into the fram and copy from the memory card to the internal memory of the frame. It is cumbersome, but it works."
5,Excellent!,Photo quality is very good & it is incredibly easy to add/remove pictures & music by using the memory card. Sound quality is good too. Overall very happy with this frame.
3,Pretty Good,"I don't know if I got a lemon or if all of these products have this defect, but the off/on timer does not work. The timer is designed to allow you to specify when you want your frame to operate. I enabled the timer to shut off at 8pm. The frame shut off its slide show running from an SD card at 8pm. Then a little while longer it turned back on again, this time running the slide show from the internal memory. I shut it off manually using the remote, and again a little while longer while I was sitting in the room the frame just turned on again. Finally I just flipped the switch. Also after the frame turned on, it no longer recognized the SD card until I pulled it out and put it back in again.As far as resolution quality and look, I really like the frame. It plays videos great and it is fun and easy to load pictures to the frame.The remote only works at very close range to the frame."
4,"Kodak 8"" digital frame","I thought the size might be too small as mine is a 10"" but my dad LOVES it! The problem is, you can't randomize the slide show."
2,Shows pictures well but nothing else is good,"The SV811 does its primary task of displaying jpg images well. If that is all you want, then fine.However, none of its other features are without flaw. Do not buy it for them.* mp3 playing interface is awkward. Speakers are tinny.* Most videos will not play properly. It is designed to play videos taken from still cameras-- but several formats from still cameras do not play well. If you want to encode video for it, try VCD format. Nothing else has worked for me. With VCD, it badly needs a deinterlacer. The video is not good.* Failed to recognize a new SD high capacity external card (an old standard capacity card was fine).* File transfer function failed.* I upgraded to new firmware-- and functionality became worse."
2,Kodak disappointed me.,"I purchased this after reading an early review in Consumer Reports.It is attractive, and has many nice features. Unfortunately, the software is rudimentary, and I could not conceive of giving it to my parents as a Christmas gift. I subsequently bought the Pandigital 8.0 which is a much nicer software interface.EML"
1,"Woman, Native, Other... What?","This ""book"" is quite possibly the most nonsensical, self-indulgent collection of phrases I've ever encountered. If I weren't assigned this in class, and perhaps despite that fact, I would have thought it was a publisher's joke. And not the funny kind, the ""see what kind of drivel we can put out when we panderingly label it 'academic' and 'post-modern'"" kind. This book made me lose faith in publishing, academia, anthropology, and film studies, so I guess it succeeded in something."
5,Best anime ever,"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. I was hoarse from laughing at the end. However this is not for everyone because much of its humor comes from being really bizarre. It takes anime cliches and exagerates them beyond absurdity. The animation, despite its low quality has a disjointed, exagerated style that fits perfectly."
4,"Excellent, Great Value","I love this tablet pc. It's great to run a pc with the option of using the stylus pen or touchpad instead of a mouse. (...) I haven't used the cd/dvd burner yet, but, I'm glad it is included. This pc has everything I need. The only drawback for me was getting used to the 14"" screen, which is great for watching movies, but, makes the laptop big and and a little heavier than I would like. A 12"" screen would be perfect. Overall, TOSHIBA earned my 4 stars."
3,Christmas Album,"I've enjoyed them, been a fan over the years, this one project was just okay. Was looking for more exciting arrangements."
3,Never again Jacquard,"I must concede that you get a nice set for the price, But never again I would buy another jacquard comforter. You can't move without reaming the thread. If you are on a fix budget and would something shiny, nice and for show and tell, I would recommend this, but take it off when you are ready to sleep, the comforter is strong, but the thread print will get you fustrated. Maybe try putting a plastic cover off it. HA!"
5,Excellent Product,"I've used Mobil One for the past 20 years without issue, but when I could not locate 5w-50 in their line I went with the Syntec. I have used Syntec in the past on odd occassions, and it performed well but I never made the switch. I'll continue to use the Syntec and am planning on changing my other two vehicles over to the full synthetic Syntec as well."
4,Fun addition to littlest pet shop,"My 6 year old daughter loves this toy. The pets have a magnetic paw that allows them to sit on the stage and be moved from left to right and back again. They can also sit on the skateboard and move across the tightrope. On the far right about 1/2 way up you will notice a stand. The pet can sit there and then you spin the wheel around to make them twirl. If you have the bird, you are supposed to be able to sit the bird on the perch and have it swing. Since this set does not include a bird I was unable to try out that feature. The BEST part of the set is the dog that catches the frisbee. The dog is the only included pet. He sits on the stage, and you launch a magetic frisbee right into his mouth. Very fun!! I wish the stage where the pets are awarded 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place were also magnetic, but sadly they aren't. It makes it hard to get the pets on there without knocking the other pets off."
2,"Not used, easy to lose pieces","This was the first playset that my daughter received for the Littlest Pet Shop series. Unfortunately, it has hardly been used, although she plays with her LPS figures quite often. This playset offers very little value. The small circular discs that are launched from the base are easily lost by children, especially if you're not inclined to clean-up after they play. There's basically just a few perches onto which you can place the figures, and the high-wire skateboard provides little excitement. This is not a required accessory for LPS collectors."
3,For specialty soldering irons only,I have a radio shack 100watt soldering and I mistakenly assumed these would fit. I didn't give it too bad of a rating since I should have done more research on what this was for. The soldering iron these are for must be super tiny.
3,Mediocre,"After reading this my first thought was: ""Well, maybe some day they really will come out with a definitive biography of Artaud.""Antonin Artaud, the enigmatic and crazed King of Modern Poetry, is ripe for a huge biography detailing his childhood, the intricacies of his tremendous psychological difficulties, his revolutionary approach to theatre, etc. Maybe Barber does his best with the nearly incomprehensible subject he chose--blurbs about his drug use, his migraine filled childhood, and the standard boring crap about his disagreements with and eventual expulsion from the surrealist movement. The analysis of his 'poetry' is pedestrian, nothing special. I gave it three stars because there are some amusing stories and hitherto untold tales about Artaud's bizarre exploits toward the end of his life. All in all, though, a disappointment."
3,Gina's a Badass,"A few weeks ago I watched the trailer to this movie and thought... ""Gezz another movie where the girl is beating up the guys? What a load of BS"". So I passed it by. I didn't realize it was Gina Carano. People who don't know of Gina? She is a real fighter not an actor. She really can beat the crap out of most guys. So I watched the movie. It seemed to have some problems of direction. But, I loved watching Gina move what an extraordinary athlete is Gina. She needed some more direction. Hey Gina maybe you should learn to raise your eyebrow like Dwayne Johnson. You know... when someone says something stupid, you raise your eyebrow just before you smack the crap out of them."
2,"Disconnected, disjointed.","This movie was one I had looked forward to for quite a while and now I can't remember why. Without giving anything away, let's say it jumps around a lot, there is very little rhyme and reason as to why things are happening and the cast seems to have less a clue about what was going on than I did. Poor editting, mediocre cinema, poor writing, bad plot, horrible dialog. It's all there. It's just a sad movie and yet I might suggest you watch it . . . so I don't have to suffer alone."
2,Confusing,"I love chick-kicks-ass movies, but this one is simply confusing. It's all happening because of an incident in Barcelona, but it's never clear exactly what the incident was. We're left confused as to who are the good guys and bad guys. And the people trying to kill the heroine seem awfully inept. This is the second movie from director Steven Soderbergh to go into the sell-back box. Contagion went there as well."
2,Too slow!,"I love Gina from American Gladiators and MMA of course. I was so looking foward to see more of her in this movie, but after 20 mins I turned it off. The script was awful, I am not a fan of Tatum because of his lack of enthisiasm on roles. That really made me shut it off. Great stars but that did not help the movie. Hope she gets more roles with a better script so she can shine like I know she can."
2,Disappointing,Poor story - confusing and boring. I almost stopped watching mid-way which is something I hardly ever do. I expected more from this director and cast.
2,talk about hype...,"I was excited to see this movie from what I saw of the previews. But when I got it I wish I had rented it first. The plot was at best fair. The story was slow and ill formed. It bordered on cliche with the way it was played out. The characters were not well established and I did not like how the female lead role was beaten more times than I can count in the film. It made the male leads seem very cowardly. I found the movie in many parts to be boring with the ending that was simply laughable and very poorly done. Don't buy it, rent it first and save yourself a few bucks."
1,Had to stop Watching,"I gave this movie a full hour to develop and yet it kept dragging. The plot is the usual as other spy double cross movies and it just seemed like it was not going to deviate much from it. Maybe the ending will be good, but I could not take it any longer. First movie in a long time I had to stop watching."
3,"Seemed to Have Potential, however was simply a Disappointment","I had all my friends over one night to watch this movie and we all were very disappointed. Even with the perfect cast, it lacked the intensity and realism that I was expecting. I do understand this is not anything like a Bourne movie and I was not expecting anything like that, however I was still disappointed by the plot and simple dialogue.The PQ was very bland as well as the AQ. Over-all the presentation was dull and lifeless.We did watch the movie throughout, however it is not one that I ever plan on watching again. It was all over the place and difficult to watch.Not recommended to buy, maybe a rent on a boring evening."
1,I demand a refund!,"I rented this movie on google and paid $2.99 for it. I want my money back. It was so horrible I didn't even finish watching it. It was sloppy and all over the place. Other than the fight scenes, there was no plot or story line. It was just a hot mess. Spare yourself the frowns of bewilderment and anger. You'll never get those precious moment of life back if you watch it, and believe me - you will want that time back."
1,Don't waste your time,"I can't believe how bad the acting is in this movie. For the small parts and bits of lines that the big name, big film, popular GUYS in this movie had it wasn't enough to carry the low budget film through the 1:30 hours. It was BRUTAL to finish. The female, while she had a nice body, was absolutely terrible throughout the film. She couldn't have saved her acting career even if she had done a topless scene. Who is Steven Soberberg? lol. I feel like my 3.99 was totally wasted when I rented this from amazon."
1,totally bad,"Gina is neither hot nor is she a great fighter on screen. she is no Zoe Bell as far as stuntwomen go and she totally has no screen presence. Her body makes her movement like a sausage spinning on it's end. I may be fussy, I work at a gymnastics academy, but her build is short limbed and her balance is poor. She moves with the grace and power of a three legged dog.She has no sense of comedic timing and delivers her lines with little presence or affect. She doesn't really do much with the dialogue. I could go on but the movie was bad enough.Don't rent this, even if you have trouble sleeping."
1,garbage,this move is horrible and boring all the action you see in the preview is all the action thats in the movie.
2,BORING!!!!!!,"The good: very nice fight sequences.The bad: very POOR storyline and REALLY SLOW between fights.The ugly: I wasted both my time (which I can never get back) & my $!The rest: This was a recommendation for me and boy did they miss the mark!, simply put it was just plan BORING. If you desire to see a much better female spy movie get Salt, it's at least 10 times better. The ONLY reason it gets 2 **s is for the fight scenes, otherwise it would be -1 star. I would NOT recommend this movie.Link to ""Salt"" http://www.amazon.com/Salt/dp/B004BEMC6G/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1339877445&sr;=8-5&keywords;=salt."
1,ToJo,All I can say is this movie was boring and the acting was sublevel. For what was supposed to be an action packed movie it fails miserably. I would not recommend this movie.
1,Boring,They spent so much time in a boring back story that could have been used for acting. No the acting wasn't great but that wasn't the problem. The backstory was drawn out and boring. Made it impossible to watch.
1,"Movie that I want to like, but.","Well, I really wanted to like this movie because of the MA star Gina Carano. She steams up the Octagon with her true fighting skills, but unfortunately MA stars have a hard time making the transition to acting. You would think that with Ewan McGregor that the movie would have some real acting to beef up the other poor acting, but, not so much. It's seemed that the bad acting bug was contagious. The method in which the story line progresses is also bad. I hope that Ms Carano a) does not come hunt me down for this review and b) get turned off with this experience (first movie). I would hope she takes some acting lessons and band together with a better director. I would say watch the movie for some eye candy but it's so bad it's just not worth it, I would say watch one of her real MA fights instead."
4,Yep. Its Not Bad At All,"I'd put it on par withShooter [Blu-ray]. A Bourne Identity type movie where the main character/agent is double crossed by their handler. Considering its budget, 1/3 of the 10 year old Bourne Indentity, its not bad at all. The plot moves along and makes sense. The fight scenes are good and don't detract from the movie. Gina is not a bad actor at all. I am not sure where all the 1 star reviews are coming from. Its clearly not bad at all. Perhaps its not outlandish enough for some of today's audience. Its definitely not gadget laden likeMission: Impossible Ghost Protocol (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo +Digital Copy)and maybe that's what some where expecting. If you liked Bourne Identity or Shooter, you should enjoy Haywire."
1,HORRIBLE! !!¡,"OMG! one of the worst movies Ive ever seen! Reminded me of those 1980's B movies they use to do by a company called Golan and Globus. You know the same people who did superman 4 . The fighting scenes are stiff and the story laughable. And the ending really stupid. I promise you that at the end of this flick you will be saying "" is that it, that's the ending ""? What a crock!! So don't buy it cause you will regret it. I still do!"
1,review,did not like it at all. the plot was boring. all of the actors did a very terrible job acting.
2,NOT a must see movie,Did not like it when the music in the movie was louder than the gunfire action. The actress did a lot of walking in this movie. Sometimes the movie draged on with little action and dialogue. Some of the action scenes are ok.
1,Unwatchable,"I can watch just about anything but I could not handle this. It is not the actors/actress fault. It is everything else, especially the music. Terrible, terrible. I have already written more than this movie deserves. Do yourself a huge favor and ignore this one."
3,Not as expected,I had to watch this movie twice to figure out what was going on? Seems that there may have been some parts left out to fit the standard time frame for movies these days. The action was good.
3,Watched it once and that is enough,"It was a good thing I did not have high expectations of this movie. The overall story line was interesting, but certain parts were poorly executed. At times, it was hard to keep up with what was going on. I will say, it is very cool Gina Carano performed her own stunts."
3,"Good action movie, but too violent for my taste...","The movie was good, plot was good, had some nice surprises. Interesting... tempo..? The violence was just a little too real life for me. I just can't get on board with a movie where a guy jumps on top of a girl and starts pounding on her face... too much."
2,HAYWIRE,The storyline was contrived and did not flow properly. Other than the action/fight scenes the movie was not very good.
3,"Good, but imperfect camera work and editing","It's a real stretch to enjoy action-chicks in a movie, but this is a bit more believable. Still, some of the fight scenes were poorly conducted/directed/photographed and others were perfect. The entire movie was uneven in that manner. The weaponry was top rate. The tech advisers and trainers knew their stuff."
2,Movie and Music was horrible,Pretty bad- they had this annoying music playing through everything. I cannot believe all these start signed up for this movie. Really bad.. just boring and overall a big waste of time.
2,A waste of an hour and a half.,"Ms. UFC needs to stick to UFC. She's a HORRIBLE actress from the first 5 minutes and throughout the movie. The action sequences are simple, and the movie overall has a low-budget appearance.I love action movies, sometimes I love cheap cheesy action movies, but this one was a drag through and through. The plot is easily guessed, and barely moves you along from one mediocre action sequence to the next.Save your time and effort and go for something else. Actually, almost anything else : /"
2,Over hyped!,The preview looked good but the actual movie is so lacking. I was quite disappointed with the whole movie. Actions were slow and not a lot. Script was so-so and nothing special.
2,every now and then,"every now and then, critics gang up on a movie, a book, a play of highest quality, and condemn it, or lowest, and praise it up likewise, as an unbreakable phalanx, and in direct contradiction of popular opinion. they do this in order to sustain their authority. after all, if they are always concurring with plebians, then who needs critics? this is not one of those times. i suggest as an alternate selection safe house...ciao."
4,"What ""movie"" were these other people watching?","I don't understand why people rated this film so badly.The largest flaw in the film was Gina explaining to a car-jacked-nobody, and making him memorizea bunch of actions she had taken - for who? and what purpose? not explained well.The fight scenes are fabulous - This actress is a professional mixed martial arts champ.For some of the fight scenes, the actual actors played the parts - vs. stunt doubles.I thought it was great vintage cloak and dagger - only updated to today's contracted 'operators'.The gun fights were equally done with care.The shoot settings were world class as well.I have to give it 4 stars for Gina Carano's work in this film. Bravo!I do hope we see her in more films."
4,Not Bad,I rented this to be entertained and I was. The action was great and so was Gina. Time between the action scenes wasn't that bad unless you forgot to take your ADHD meds. Worth a rental but I wouldn't buy it.
3,Good but not great,I would recommend this movie for viewing. You should not expect too much in terms of a story line. Good for a Friday or Saturday evening movie if you can't find anything in TV.
3,haywire,"Gina Carano is great...the rest if the movie, eeeh...ok. I suggest you rent this movie before you buy! Action is great...it just has a low budget feel."
1,LameWire,"Was sucked in to see this movie by a decent preview. What a terrible mistake. I am not a UFC fan but I am a fan of strong female characters so I think I can give a less agenda-driven opinion on this movie.The main character could barely act, the famous actors in this film were terrible, the story was not complicated but the director kept flashing back to make it appear more complicated, the fight scenes were totally unrealistic (except for one), the lighting was lousy, minutes spent watching the main character walk through the streets or meander over the roof (????), totally uncreative swipes between scenes.....I could go on but I think I've wasted enough of my life on this piece of junk.Unless you're an unwavering disciple of this director or a cheerleader for this untalented female fighter, your chances of really enjoying this movie are slim to none."
1,I can't believe people have been eagerly waiting for this to come out...,"This movie sucks, simple as that. It's boring as all heck, and I wasn't even paying full attention to it. I would have left the theater screaming if I'd paid $12 to see this crap. Don't let the hype fool you; I have NO IDEA why everyone was looking forward to this film."
1,What a waste of time this was...,I can see where they were trying to go with this one but it just never made it. Just go watch The Limey instead.. way better than this...
2,Haywire,"Great cast ,great acting, horrible script HORRIBLE directing. If u can get past the first 50 min its tolerable. I regret the 7 bucks I paid to see this the previws looked amazing! But,I was mistaken.Please listen to me and ATLEAT rent it before you buy it!!"
1,Waste of time.,This is a ridiculous excuse for a movie. Watch the trailer; you got it. No reason to torture yourself.
1,a boring movie,"A very disappointing and boring movie. Especially the first half, the pace is too slow for audience to care. And the flashback narrative makes the story chaotic and draw-out. For all your people out there who want to watch Gina Carano, there are not many fighting scenes in the movie. That did make me wonder why they cast her in the first place. The movie was only in my local theater for one week, so I have to spend $7 on train in addition to the movie ticket. After I finished watching, I understood why it made so little money at boxoffce.The casts are talented, but that doesn't make the movie much more watchable since they weren't given much to do.Bottom line is, ordinary people won't enjoy this movie, and neither will most extraordinary people."
1,Pass the Salt,"This film unfairly cast some allure due to the expansive supporting cast and director. While it was entertaining, in a sense, to see so many favorite actors age; that wasn't the reason I purchased the film. I purchased the film expecting to enjoy a B+ movie with some satisfying direction and a good supporting cast rooting around in a film written by Lem Dobbs who actually hasn't written anything worthwhile since the ""Score"" 10 years ago (hence the B+). I also lulled myself into thinking that Steven Soderbergh may have had some real influence in the film besides subsequently whiling away his time boring me with 5 minutes of Gina Carano running around in the film. Yes she can run. Yes, she can beat up guys. But can she act? Poorly directed, poorly written and the poorest acting by the ""star""; I can only recommend this film to...no one! I spent my evening apologizing to my girlfriend and hey!?... is Steven Soderbergh dating Gina Carano?"
1,Bad,"I am an avid action movie fan. This movie was terrible. I am also a lifelong martial artist. The fight scenes were weak. Don't wait for netflix or redbox or whatever you use, just forget about it."
1,Horrible,This movie was so awful that I couldn't even finish it after starting and stopping 3 different times. Do not recommend.
2,Lame,Lame and hard to follow due to the slow pace. I found myself wanting to clean the house instead of finishing this movie.
1,Most boring action movie ever!,Very little action with lots of long boring parts in between. Seems like they tried to make it artistic with the filming and music but didn't work for me. The lack of plot and action was disappointing. I expected better with some of the actors that were in this movie. Much better action movies out there.
1,Gina was alright; Plot was not bad; Dialogue was awful; Cinematography was the worst.,"The best scenes were shown in the trailer.For a movie with some big name actors, the cinematography and dialogue made the movie awful.Often times, it felt like the movie was low budget and just used one camera and shot from one angle way too long.A decision was made to shoot the fight scenes from a distance. Why? So we can see the sunset on the beach?Too bad - it could have been better.I wished Gina's character was as smooth as Matt Damon's character in the Bourne Identity series.Her fight scenes were outstanding."
2,:(,The preview is better than the movie. Fighting scenes were the best part of the movie.....everything in between was very boring.
1,Waste of big name talent,"What a waste of big name talent in supporting roles. The lead actress wasn't even big name (nor will she ever be) and she was just awful. Poor acting, Poor script, poor dialog, all-round disappointing. Even the fight scenes didn't look real. The actors looked like they were just practicing their choreography in the fight scenes. You could actually see them move into position to take a hit. I knew after the first totally unbelievable scene the whole movie would be bad but watched the whole thing anyway. The film jumps all over the place without making it clear why, and drops characters without explanation shortly after they are inserted into the plot.My copy had subtitles I couldn't get rid of, but they came in handy when I realized half the dialog was mumbled. Glad I got it from the library, because I would have felt bad even paying $1 at Redbox for this. This film looked like it was written and made by a first year film student, not seasoned professionals."
2,Gina's acting debut....,Gina's acting was good but the movie itself was terrible. Atmosphere felt like a B movie at best. Action scenes are few and far between; weak dialogue and the movie plot barely held my interest. Would not recommend.
2,Cannot believe...,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, I really thought it would be good. Within 10 minutes of watching it I wanted to stop it and never watch it again. I am deeply disappointed in this movie. I love action movies, but this one reeked of a b-rated movie. The fight scenes were awesome, but there was something definitely missing in this movie."
2,Disappointing...I wanted to like this movie,"I wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, I can't recommend seeing it.The Bad: The story is basically a series of flashbacks. They are hard to follow. The plot is slow and there's surprisingly little dialog. The acting was fairly wooden (think Ashley Judd). The worst part was the story...just plain old boring.The Good: Action scenes are excellent. Gina Carano is very convincing and confident in the fight scenes. They are the best part."
1,Hay wire,"This additive is best , but the movie is suck,,,,,,, I'm hate it , never buy movie like this s*** again , thanks tu doan"
1,heywier,this was 1 of the worse movies i have ever seen. so sad and people dont have money to waste these days.so please dont waste your money please. it was long and slow nothing like it reads at all an dont be fooled by the cover it was just a couple of fight sceans and i did not know what to make of the ending.
1,steven segal got a sex change and lost 200 lbs.,"wow, what a tremendous waste of time. don't let the a list cast fool you this is as bad as it gets all the way around."
1,Fast forward failure,"On a scale of 1 to 10 I would give this movie a 1, but only because I couldn't give it a 0.The plot is so slow and boring that I had to fast forward over 95% of it at 4X speed to keep from falling asleep. And even at that I couldn't take it anymore about halfway through and ejected the DVD so I could watch a rerun of Gunsmoke.Gina is hot, but her fight scenes mainly consist of her getting jumped from behind and getting beat up. She ultimately prevails with some ground submission thing out of Gracie jujitsu which is inconsistent with the rest of the fight.The other action scenes mainly consist of her running away from someone.I don't know if the second half of the movie is any better, but I didn't want to fast forward through it long enough to find out."
2,Disappointed,"I feel I have pretty low expectations for being entertained by movies liking many that others find ""boring"", but this one was just uninteresting. I found myself wanting to turn it off after the first 30mins, but decided to sit through it and found myself just picking it apart instead of being entertained... Just a poor re-enactment of an over used plot."
1,Booooring!,"I'm an action movie lover from way back and my wife normally tells me the movies I say were not that bad were in fact really bad. So when I say this movie is really boring I mean it was REALLY boring. It is only the 3rd movie in my life that put me to sleep. Not once, because I gave it the benefit of the doubt that I may have been more tired than I thought and tried watching it again when I woke up at 12:30 am (I usually go to bed around 2am but fell asleep at 10pm watching this film) and ended up falling asleep again and sleeping on the couch all night. I had rented it but I may purchase it now just for nights when I can't seem to fall asleep as this movie is better than medication."
2,It should be better,"When I saw the preview for this I could not wait for it to come out. Then I figured it did poorly at the theatre due to bad timing. But that was not the case.It has poor flashbacks, poor casting (other than 2 people) and where is the music, romance or any kind of enemy to hate?She is one dimensional (she can fight).In similar movies, An equally matched adversary or specialist is sent to take down the star of the movie. In Haywire the audience sees that the attacker(aka enemy) is not a specialist at all. Matter of fact Mallory (played by Gina Carano) actually replies, ""They sent you?"". And I know what she meant after the ending credits.The Casting Director did not do a good job. Other than Gina Carano and Michael Douglas you have a bunch of bad selections.Its a Jason Bourne type formula that was poorly executed. She's made for these types of movies and its time for a female version of Jason Bourne."
1,horrible movie & gina isn't really sexy,"this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I wish I could get a refund, it's incredibly boring, & you notice that gina isn't sexy, she's actually unattractive, but in the trailer they showed you the clips where she looks her best...but throughout the movie she looks butch, & back to the movie it is very slow/methodical from start to finish..."
3,"Too slow, too much whispering",This could have been a much better action movie if the scenes between action sequences didn't take so long. Gina Carano's character needed more development and Bill Paxton's character was very wooden. Soderbergh did an excellent job of making her out as tough as nails but the low whispering dialog forced me to roll back the scene and turn up the volume. There is potential for a sequel but better writers are needed. I'm glad I didn't pay $12 per person plus another $11.50 for snacks to see this.
4,Fast Action,I found this movie to be a very fast action type of movie. I did not recognize the female lead at all but I still enjoyed the movie.
3,Plenty of action but not SALT or Jason Bourne,"Story line is a little weak, main character is also a little weak. Trying to much to be Salt, or a female version of Jason Bourne. Which the story actress and plot just can't match. It was an okay action flick I rented. I wouldn't purchase but that's me. I would purchase SALT instead much better movie."
3,Why all the low reviews?,"I was worried after seeing all the low rated reviews but really enjoyed the movie. Good action, characters I cared about, good to know that the actress is a real-life hard ass. See it!"
3,Great Fights But Thin Story,"Secret agents on foreign missions with the usual double crosses, chases, and revenge. We've seen a lot of female action heroes lately but this has got to be the toughest girl in the world, no joke. She needs to retire from cage fighting before they mess up her face and just act full time."
4,"Top-notch, absorbing","An unusual approach to an action movie, deliberately understated. A lot of flashbacks and puzzle pieces. Even the score is relatively languorous, if hip. The film is fresh, compelling, and well-done in every way, a cleanly realized vision. It does not deserve the low-star ratings given by viewers who are put off by the quirkiness of the movie."
4,"Well written, well acted...what's with the bad reviews?","I really liked this movie and am baffled by all the 1-star reviews. It actually has a plot, was cast well and well written. The feel is kind a mix of The Transporter (the first one) and The Bourne movies. The fight scenes would make Jason Statham proud and Gina Carano's acting was surprisingly good for her first time out. Hope they make a sequel."
1,Terrible!,The acting in this movie could not have possibly been any worse. Wow. I wasn't even sober and it still was terrible! Stay away!
2,couldnt wait for it to end,"just not enjoyable at all. alot of scenes could have been shortened, so much long silences. only thing that was descent was the fighting, but even thaT looked too choreographed. and i just didnt believe her as an actress. best she sticks to MMA."
3,a little boring,"Okay, Gina Carano is hot, and she can flat-out-let-me-tell-you kick serious, well, you know... And this woman is not faking either! You can tell choreographed stuff. No...this girl is mean...the reason I rated so low is because the plot just drags and drags. I think they were trying to do a Female James Bond...all I did while watching this movie is wait for her to do her thing...Carano is great. If nothing else, check out the movie to watch this bad woman...enough said"
3,Average Spy Movie,"This movie isn't going to win awards, and is not what you're looking for if you want some deep plot. This is simply a traditional ""spy double-cross"" movie with some nice fight scenes. Honestly though, I only watched this movie for the fight scenes. She's a pro-MMA fighter, and the techniques are all actual moves that work. Some great armbars and chokes.But yeah, watch this movie for what it is... a predictable spy movie with some well done fight scenes."
2,Lame. Slow.,It could of been so much better if the action scenes where faster pace. The plot isn't all there either. Wasn't impressed.
2,Terrible movie; great fight sequences,"Given the amount of A-List talent in this film, it's surprising how bad it is.Contrary to what others have said, it's not Carano's acting ability that's at fault; she's not a stuper-star, but she was competent enough.It wasn't the music, either, though admittedly, it was pretty bad.No, it was the script's fault, primarily, followed by the directing. The film just didn't have much of a story to tell: at least, not one we hadn't already seen five hundred million times before. Character development was inadequate, too; Carano's character is a cipher.But the fight sequences were damn good. If only there had been more of them."
2,Great Kick and Punch but other than that.....,"Knew nothing about this flick but wanted action. WELL, got action in the way of punch and kick and apparently action lady, woman, person, is real martial artist (did not know) and so action scenes are good BUT plot is a tangled mess. Great scenery and loved the soundtrack and editing as it crisp but gave up on trying to figure out who doing what to whom and why. Would really have liked a sort of Jamie (woman) Bond and woman in this could have carried that off. If you want to watch this, watch and play on the computer at same time and you will miss nothing,"
2,I really should have paid more attention to the reviews,"Let this be a lesson - don't look at the number of stars, read the reviews. With the number of big name actors, how could this movie be so blah? About the only positive point I can make is that the unarmed fight scenes looked realistic."
1,Like a bad date... You can only take so much.,"I have to admit, i watch more movies then a socially acceptable person should. So when i saw the previews for this action/thriller i knew i would have to see it. What a waste of 10 bucks.... The only memorable part (and it is only memorable to me cause i laughed so hard) is the L.E.O part. The rest of the movie was over shadowed my how completely bad the main actress (quite possibly could be an actor, the verdict is still out)is through out the entire film. The fight sceens are pretty good, but they way they filmed it makes it look staged. But hey, what do I know. If you think this movie looks like your cup of tea, i incourage you to give it a sip. Its all about a persons point of view."
1,Terrible!!,"I want my two hours back! The only redeeming quality was the fight scenes. If they removed the horribly bad seventies soundtrack, the lame plot and bad acting, it might have been an ok movie."
2,Not impressed,It didn't have the action in it that I was hoping for the story was lame you knew how it was going to end from the start. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if there were good graphics or interesting martial arts but none of that happened. This film did nothing for me. I gave it 2 stars because I did finish watching it but that is the only reason.
1,Just Bad,Rarely write a review. It's bad don't waste you time. Main actress good at action scenes bad at acting. plot line weak.
1,Boring and just plain unintresting,"Wow, with the all star cast its sad that this movie was this bad. When you name a movie ""Haywire"" people expect to see action at every turn and this movie didn't deliver."
3,it's ok,the movie arrived on time and in good condition. The acting was ok...I wasn't reallyimpressed with girl...I bought the movie for other reasons.
2,Only the fight,"scenes were any good. And let's face it that is the only reason any man would watch it. Gina Carano is a very gifted athlete and is extemely skilled in martial arts. The problem I had was every fight scene looked the same. she beat on the men they beat on her, back and forth untill you know without me saying who wins. I like seeing a woman really beat up a man but only if it is real and I don't know who is going to win."
2,Haywire,"Another try at a sexy action movie, which is just plain bad. Pull in the audience with women being the villain or just a stand by eye candy. The actress is B movie material.Put her in the ring not in a movie."
3,This is Simply What I Think,"I don't care for writing reviews, but I wanted to rate the movie and to do so Amazon requires a twenty-word review. So... I liked it; not too much, but enough. The fight scenes were different; I liked them, too. For her first movie, Ms. Carano had a big role and carried it off pretty well. I hope she makes another movie, I'd like to watch it too."
2,Didn't get it.,The few fight scenes were cool but other than that the movie made no sense. And that music...that MUSIC the whole movie gave me a headache! Not worth it!
2,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I fell asleep on this movie, not much action and the acting was sub par. I thought that I would enjoy this movie from the preview. but it was not worth the money I paid to rent it."
2,"Boring for an ""action"" movie","It gets an extra star for the cast, but really, what were they thinking? I literally fell asleep about 20 minutes into this movie. There is very little character development, dialogue, or background, all of which would have been helpful to explain the loosely woven fight scenes.Overall this was no ""Taken,"" and definitely not a Jason Statham movie (unless maybe Killer Elite). I had such high hopes for a female focused movie - very disappointing."
1,Horrible and unbelievable,"I watched this movie yesterday and I want my $2 rental fee back! :/ The plot is extremely thin, the acting, especially of the lead actress, is awful, and towards the end the heroine's dad makes a mistake that should have been obvious to the bad guy but apparently nobody notices it. The lead actress runs around hiding in a very identifiable hat and has next to no morals...that's probably the only realistic part of the movie."
1,I can't believe I watched the whole movie. What a waste.,"This movie started out bad and got worse.I am an eternal optimist and just kept waiting for it to get good.It never did.I was robbed of an hour of my life.This movie really, really wanted to be Pulp Fiction and even copied the music.Too bad it lacked a script and good acting. Character development was nonexistent.There was not a single character in the movie who I did not want to die.The ending sucked too.Whoever wrote and directed this needs to take some time off and look for a new career.Mike C"
1,Montage movie,"This movie is one large series of montages. Yes the girl is hot... but don't be fooled. Fifteen minutes into the movie, and I bet not One Hundred words have been spoken...The director should have been given an award for longest montage in a movie...Ever!"
2,One of the most anticipated of 2012? My bad.,"SO-DER-BEEEEERRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! This was one of my most anticipated films of 2012, and now, after seeing it, I feel like it fizzled. The film was OK but not as good as the trailer makes it out to be. The story is simple, which would be fine if it weren't for the fact that a lot of needless plot points were thrown in. I've always felt like director Steven Soderbergh is very overrated; his films aren't that good. And this proves that point. The cast itself was stellar (Carano is beautiful and can majorly kick butt), and I like the way the hand-to-hand combat scenes had no music or fancy sound effects, but a so-so story and lackluster ending make this film forgettable."
1,Haywire a terrible movie,With all the big stars this was an absolute waste of their talent. I have seen Gena in MMA and she is worth the ticket of admission but as lead role forget it. THeplot was stupid . The action sequels were seen in the trailer. This movie is not even fun to watch.
1,Didn't get it.,"Action movies without soundtracks just don't work, IMHO. Just couldn't get into it. I think most everyone would pass on this one. I wish I had."
1,"horrible, boring","Please don't watch this. You will get to the end and ask, why. It is a waste of time. Horribly boring. Please, just save yourself the time and watch something else."
1,Shockingly bad,"I like so many of the actors who appear in this ... too bad it was so bad. Forget B, this bomb was a D for dud."
1,What a deception!,"Very Bad Things is a horrible film. It is one of those movies that put you through the wringer. It doesn't tickle the real action bone -- it pulverizes it. You don't know whether to see the real fight , sex, or if you simply want to walk out of this horrible movie."
2,Haywire,"Downloaded this video because I missed it at the show. I'm glad I did not waste my 5.00. It was confusing throughout the whole movie. Yes, there were a lot of action scenes but it appears to me that the main character was always walking somewhere. Like I said the movie was confusing. But when you can't find anything to do outside of the house on a Saturday afternoon this could kill some time."
3,Slow movie,"Columbia, was better. Movie starts slow. Action is good. Seems very British (ie slow dry). Idea is dated so must be really good to be noticed. It is not really good."
3,meh,"the plot is your typical double crossing conspiracy spy movie.I only watched it because i love gina(#1 female MMA fighter).Even though she looks super cute in this movie and some fight scenes were cool, but there wasn't enough fight scenes and there was a lot of useless bad dialog.If they had more gun fights or fighting scenes this movie would have been better.Overall gina, did great and i would like to see her in a good action flick where there is more then 4 fight scenes....."
3,Huh?!,"Incredible A-list cast, confusing plot, bad effects/sound, etc. I agree with other reviews that the movie was probably designed to highlight Gina Carano. She is not nearly as bad as others have indicated. If you're looking to kill 93 minutes - then it's fine. Don't look for deep thoughts."
3,Not quite sure what to think,"It isn't awful, but it also isn't great. The burned agent story has been done a million times, so it's about how you do it. SALT may have had a lot of flashy editing during the fight scenes but there was tension and suspense and adrenaline. This may of had realistic fight scenes but it was so flat. There was danger, but with a jazz track running underneath the action - the danger had no teeth. With a name like Haywire, one would expect some crazy action scenes and a lot of blood, but this was just so... tame. And calm and dull.I read an interview where SS said they electronically altered her voice - I wonder how bad her acting was with her real voice.The most I can really say is that I saw it... and meh."
1,'Hay' what is going on and 'wire' we watching this?,I decided to watch this the another night with 4 friends that will normally sit through anything - especially if we paid for it. Usually at worst we can entertain ourselves by mocking the movie if it is lame. This was an exception. It wasn't even worth mocking... we just all sat there scratching our heads. The movie struck me as an art students attempt to overuse every possible film stylization ad nauseam. As some of the other reviewers said; absolute waste of time and money. If only we had stuck with watching the trailer.... it was the most entertaining thing they filmed for this movie.
2,good action very thin plot,"The movie showed lots of promise on the trailer, but the plot was too thin and the story line invisible over the action sequences, great delivery by Gina Cararo, better luck next time."
4,Hot action,Great action and awesome performance from Gina Carano. One of her hand to hand combat scenes is worth the whole movie!
4,"Gina's great, Haywire is a real underrated gem","I just don't get all the negative reviews. Haywire is an exciting gem of a film, with a minimalist almost stripped down 70s feel in terms of locales and ambience. The fight scenes are excellent, and Gina Carano has the makings of a real action star. The plot was fairly well put together, and the cast was terrific. I really would like to see her in some more of these types of films. Maybe a series is in store for ""Mallory Kane""I enjoyed this thoroughly. I would encourage people to give it a chance. It is a solid thriller and she definitely holds her own. The fight scenens, containing some ultra authentic MMA moves, are outstanding. Very enjoyable."
3,Lots of action.... little acting.,"She's a beauty to watch and her skills are grand but, I just couldn't follow along because I was completely bored with the story."
2,Not Even A Good Family Film,"Saw this on VHS a few years ago and figured all the copies had been burned and the ashes spread to the four corners of the Earth. Imagine my surprise to see it appear on DVD now. Was somebody clamouring to see a movie starring John Astin, Lou Rawls and Judge Reinhold? I think not. The story involves some nonsense about a camp called betaville where leaders of the world send their children to be safe and sound...until two warring planets decide to get Earth mixed up in their squabble. An Emissary comes to Camp Betaville to warn the children and now President Sender (John Astin) and his scientists have to come up with a secret weapon to stop the alien invaders led by the ""charismatic"" Tim Kazurinsky. This looked like it might be a decent family film but it's totally unfunny and leaves kids...and parents, totally bored."
2,Can you say flimsy?,"Contrary to the description this is NOT comparable in any way to duct tape. As for a vinyl tape, it is even worse. Super flimsy. Guess that is why it is so easy to tear by hand."
2,I hate Wolfram...,"That's probably an entirely personal matter of taste, but he just ruined the whole show for me. I bought it on sale and the first half hour looks great but it sort of goes down hill. The hero should have been best friends and had more adventures with the admirable Conrad. This show was almost a three but I gave it a two out of frustration. Go watch or buy ""07-Ghost"" instead. That is a hundred times better."
4,faraway lurs review,"I am in the process of reading The Faraway Lurs. It is a really enjoyable book; the author doesn't make the tribes sound primative, rather the way you have lived for your whole life. Wolfstone is a wonderful Romeo character, and Heather poses as a gutsy Julliet. The Swampwife and Buzz also add interest to the story. It is so intriguing that it is based on a true story of a Danish girl found in a peat bog, who dissolved almost immediatly after reaching the air. Its amazing how Behn spins Heather and her world from the few known facts."
3,"sure fine for some, I prefer earlier date dead","the Pick of newest date I know. in general I prefer older dead to newer. on newer ones they play too slow and guitars sound too synthetic. Electricguitars may be distorted a little.let it grow/ wheather report and eyes are excellent songs and they do them well here. Love the songs Cassidy, great duettvocals of Bob and Donna, in general actually, and Sugar Magnoliadiscs three and four are better than one and two.There is some overlap of songs on both shows, but then for this price....Dancing in the street is a horrible song, at least when the dead do it,it just doesn't suit their style. Scarlet Begonias is also a weak song.Is this shortly after the return of Mickey Hart? With his appearance thewhole drumming style changes to the stomping dinosaur...interesting, but maybe with Bill alone they were more dynamic.It's cool, but I prefer the picks up to 74..."
5,The illustrations are beautiful!,My son and I love all Kim Lewis's books. Her cosy illustrations are so dear. This story is simple and meaningful.
1,Be warned: you can't use custom teams in franchise mode,"The PC version of Madden 2005 has eliminated the option of using created teams in franchise mode. If you enjoyed this feature in past versions of Madden PC, you're out of luck this time. Nice upgrade, eh?"
5,Great Game!,"I recently bought this game along with a Logitech Wingman Rumblepad 2 gamepad. It's an awesome game, I got it, installed it and have rarely stopped playing it since. I can't say enough about this game. It is different from the console versions, so if you've played those, you still haven;pt experienced what it's like on the PC. Although the game setup is different, the gameplay is very much the same. The gamepad works really well with it, although I would recommend you buy one if you haven't already, the keyboard just doesn't utilize this game's capability. The hitstick and playmaker controls are awesome, but you can't use them if you don't have a gamepad.Overall, this game is insanely fun and I would recommend it to anyone that has enjoyed the Madden Franchise before."
2,Disappointed with release date,"I was eagerly awaiting this version. It's always a good game, but somewhat arcady. Now the release date is pushed back into September and EA is completely silent on the issue. A big negative for me since it's already football season (even though it's only preseason). If the consoles can have it why can't the PC?"
2,WHY NOT FOR MAC!,"this game is okay, but I mean instead of playing it at my friends house, I mean can`t I play it at mine,anyway I dont think its even close to being as good as madden 2004. Dont get this game!"
3,um...,"Can somebody please wait until the game actually comes out to give it a 5 star rating? Just because the most overrated broadcaster has his name on the game, the game does not have to be great."
1,It's not in the game,"So, how come in Madden 2004 you can create a team and insert it into a season, but in Madden 2005, you can not? That was the one thing I liked about Madden 2004. They are suppose to progress with these games, not go backwards. Maybe the later updates will have a fix. I suggest buying Madden 2004 and bypassing this loser."
4,Madden NFL 2005 is the best (so far)!,"I have managed to get a chance to play Madden NFL 2005 and all Ican say is WOW! They have improved the graphics and gameplay tomake it more realistic. Its improved owner mode will make footballrage with joy. The new owner mode will allow you to make new andbetter stadiums. You'll be able to keep players but your cap roomwon't go down as much. And greatest thing is you actually haveto play like an all-star to score, which you're scores won'tbe 80 poitns to 70. From what it looks like, the Madden NFL series will be the top sporting game once agian."
2,No Force Feedback Support,"Again just like in past years, Madden does not support force feedback or rumblepads. Now of all the games EA Sports makes that have these effects, wouldn't you think football would be on of them?Other than that, a great game but very similar to last year."
3,Meh,"Keep in mind if you want to use the new ""hit stick"" and several other new features you need to drop another $20 on a game controller, since these options aren't available on the keyboard.Otherwise, the game is pretty much the same, even missing a couple features -- You can no longer play as a created team in Franchise mode.You also receive messages when playing in franchise mode telling you to select team captains from the Team Roster screen. Unfortunantly if you hunt around on the EA support website, you will discover that there is in fact no way to access the Team Roster screen or appoint team captains."
5,One of the Best,"I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but you have got to be kidding if you think that this book was anything less than amazing. I read the book cover to cover in a matter of hours.The characters were interesting and the plot was too hot to handle. This was truly one of the best books that I have ever read. It made me cry, laugh and want to even slap a couple of the cahracters. It even made me stop and think about my own personal relationship and would it survive those types of issues.In closing I just have to say that for those who thought that this book was just 'ok', well maybe you should read it again but closer within yourself as you do."
2,Not worth the $7,"This is by far one of the worst unrealistic stories I have ever read. Everything centered around money and sex and there are many other factors of life that come into play when you are successful, middle-aged, and black. If Jada & Wellingtion had a real relationship than sure it would be believable that they were soulmates. Sex doesn't mean they needed to be together forever. In my opinion the storyline about Wellington's adoption was more interesting. I will never read the sequel to this mess of a story."
2,Could have been a lot better,"Soulmates Dissipate was truly disappointing. Jada and Wellington spend no time getting to know each other before they were in the sack. What made them soulmates, well we never really find out. The love scenes were scorching and well-written, but other than that there wasn't much to Jada or Wellington. And I don't no any woman who is foolish enough to let another woman stay in the same house with her ""man"". Also, two intelligent people like Jada and Wellington should have been able to figure out much earlier in this book that they were both played for fools. I am so turned off by this one, I won't bother to read the sequel."
5,Awesome,"A coworker suggested this book. He started by letting me read the poem "" Soulmates Dissipate"". I was hooked! I ordered the first two books of the series and delved into it completely."
5,I loved this book!!!!!!,"This was truly a page turner! Good storyline! If I had to read it again, I definitely would! Good book overall."
2,Hugh?!?,"First off, this book is all over the place. The editing is horrible and it leaves you asking too many questions. The main character can be doing/talking about something and then something else happens without addressing what she was just doing. aiat seems like a high school student wrote it.I want to like this book, really I do, but I can;t seem to pick it back up to finish it. It was poorly written!"
3,Nice Concept......Bad Editing or something,"First of all, I'll start out positive. The whole concept and story line were pretty interesting. It was nothing like I've ever read before, very original. However there were many times during my read that I thought maybe I skipped over a part, but when I went back to reread it, I realized it wasn't me that missed something, it was just the way the book was written. That fact alone made the book a lot less than it could have been. If you're the type of reader that doesn't pay attention to details and depth, then you'll love this book. If you are the type of reader that likes character development and things that make sense, then it will be kind of disappointing."
3,NO BIG DEAL,"This was my first Mary Morrison novel. This book was kind of ordinary. It was simply just ""okay"" to me. In my opinion, Wellington was kind of lame. Morrison didn't do a very good job of selling his character to me in the beginning. While she over-emphasized the point of him being financially stable, he lacked personality and maturity. He didn't come across as being ""Mr. Wonderful"", which is the point I think she was trying to make at first. He even came across as brainless and idiotic. As far as Diamond, initially Mary Morrison portrays Diamond as a strong woman. By the end of the book, she seems weak, and even pathetic at times. Anyway, towards the end, the book was all over the place. Everyone was upset with everyone, whether they had reason to be or not. The ending was a complete blur."
3,SLOW-SLOW-SLOW,Im not sure how I feel about this novel???It started out entirely to slow and with underdeveloped characters popping up every second it was very easy to get lost in the story. Like other reviews I would have to agree that the plot was very UNREALISTIC. If Wellington loved Diamond aka Jada so much how come he let go so easily & was so easily manipulated by everyone in his life. I mean his character annoyed the hell out of me not to mention his evil moms Cynthia and mistress Melanie.Honestly I only picked up a Mary B. Morrison novel because she was showcased on a TV1 documentary. I wouldn't recommend this novel to readers who enjoy juicy captivating story lines because this dose not have 1.
4,Soulmates Dissipate,"This is my first read by Mary B Morrison. It was a good read but I myself like the other reviews did not understand their connection. The only thing I noticed they had in common was the sex. At some points a got confused at what time frame the writer was in, the past or the present. And Wellington was a total idiot, Melanie was a ho, and Jada was a fool. How do except another women staying with your man for any length of time is beyond me. And I know people say men and women can be ""just"" friends but thats a very razor thin line that should be avoided."
2,Not my cup of Tea,"I actually passed this book over for years before deciding to go ahead on and read it, thinking before hand it was going to have too much sex in it for my taste but decided to go ahead and take a chance an read the book an discovered that my first thoughts on the book was right. I was not use to how the lead character Jada would go to Church on Sunday and have a threesomes and lots of sex acts the rest of the week. Even though I am in my 20's I guess i'm just to much of a prude for a book like this."
3,Umm was this copyedited?,"The book had many grammatical errors which throughly turned me off and part of the reason why it took me so long to read it. Also, the beginning was a little too jumpy, but it settled down after a couple of chapters.I think all it all it was an okay book, slightly unrealistic at times. I wish authors would be more creative with plots. I will continue to read the series and see how this story develops."
1,This Story Dissipates,I really was not feeling this book at all. The characters seemed to be very material people and I agree with the other reviewers that wondered how Jada and Wellington were soulmates. To me it just seemed like they were very compatible sexually. And do we need to know all of the name brand clothing the characters buy?I love how the author set the story up to have a sequel. Too bad I don't care about the characters enough to read it.
5,Soulmates,"Soulful, Sexy, and Totally uncensored. This book is hot, hot, hot, nothings left to the imagination. Jade Tanner has her heart stolen by gorgeous Wellington Jones. Together they embark on a rollercoaster ride filled with adventure. Jada learns some painful lessons about love, trust, and commitment. Not meant for children, this book is filled with steamy sex scenses."
1,Don't waste your time,"If you were considering reading this book, stop yourself....seriously. Its poorly written, with flat characters, an undeveloped storyline, and absolutely no depth. As a reader, it was much like watching people you hate make a total mess of their lives, and because you don't get to care about the characters, you just don't feel anything. I did, however, come up with a lengthy list of typos and grammatical misfortunes, as they were plentiful.If you like trashy soaps just for the sake of entertainment, this MAY satisfy you. As horrible as it sounds, even the trashiest soap operas are more thoroughly thought out than this waste of dead trees."
2,Ghetto Book,Even though the book was ok. It was a typical ghetto story that happens all the time. I thought the book would take on a new path instead of the typical drama.
3,Unrealistic yet a true page turner,"I recently purchased the book and finished it in an hour.It was captivating yet very slow in the beginning.I kept reading and the characters really developed more as the book progressed.However, some of the scenarios that occur in the novel were quite unrealistic and lead to some disappointment at the end.Overall, the book is well worth checking out and I look forward to reading more of Mary Morrison's books."
2,Not a good read,"I truly can't say that this was a good book. The only reason I can assume that it even got good ratings was because of the sex scenes. But otherwise it didn't live up to the name at all. There was no valid reason why the reader should think that Jada & Wellington were soulmates. I agree with the review from the reader who also pointed out that neither of them got to know each other...this was poor character developement & subtext. And it was unrealistic to believe that Jada would so easily participate on the threesome given how she hated Wellington's house guest/friend. It's a good thing that this is fiction cause it surely read like a bad soap opera. And the ending was the worst, it was soooo obvious that the author wanted to bait the reader to buy the sequel. Well it won't get my money."
4,price difference hard to overcome,"The book itself is full of wonderful information for the angora goat owner, perhaps worth the $45 I spent on it (used). But when the book arrived it had a $1 clearance sticker on it - ouch, that's some mark-up. they could have at least peeled that off, it's hard not to feel taken..."
4,Very Good,A very good book with a good story line and excellent characters. A good by at .01 cents used!
5,Only kind to use,"I use it in my Drinkwell 360 Stainless fountain for the Forever Filter by Peani Design. If you get the 360 you NEED the Forever Filter, and this is the best carbon to use, all carbon are not created equal..."
3,It's Okay,"Black Diamond Carbon - 3.65 LI was thinking it was a bigger container, pay attention tothe size before ordering. Good product :-)"
5,Sasquatch the legend of Big Foot,"I was about 13yrs old when I first watched this movie at our theater in Red Bluff,CA. This was the week before I was to go to a week long camp-out with my boy scout troop.What more can you say! We talked about this movie every night.I think I stayed awake every night,listening for the sound of big foot.When I saw this movie on DVD,I just had to have it.I going to have my grand kids watch this! Thank you Amazon!"
1,sasquatch horror,"though this video had alot of fine actors in it, the campy acting of many of the extras was just that, ""campy"". The movie leads you to believe that Yvette mineaux is going to end up with her past lover, but then does a full swing back to the husband she already has who is already making her miserable. In the end, this husband is the one who kills the beast, almost completely out of the blue. Then the worste comes, the movie just ends.Was hoping for more of a plot line and throughout the high points, it fails miserably because the ending comeas abruptly. As far as I'm concerned, the whole package was a waste of good money."
2,Don't Judge this DVD by its Cover,"The the pictures on the cover of this DVD are from the poster for the movie ""Yeti - Giant of the 20th Century"" but that movie is NOT INCLUDED on the disc - very misleading, very disappointing!"
2,Big foot movie,"This is a terrible movie, the acting is bad and not realistic at all. Don't waste you money on this. Darrell"
1,Poor Transfers Do In This Set,"I like two of the three movies in this set(Snowbeast,And Sasquatch) but you would be hard pressed to know why looking at the Poor transfers on the set. Really ,give these movies a chance,but find better copies."
5,Hard to Find!,"This dvd, included ""Sasquatch, The Legend of Bigfoot"" which is a RARE find. I had hoped to find this movie in its original uncut version on DVD, but am completely satisfied with this purchase! I viewed this film for the very first time with my Grandma when i was 10 years old. I am now 44, so i was very excited when i reveived this DVD, in its original wrapper and Brand New! Well worth the money....."
3,WHEN BIGFOOTS ATTACK!,"Spectacular old footage of the Willamette National Forest and theDeschutes National Forest with some good wildlife footage thrown in.Guys on horseback set out to find proof of bigfoot. Mostly scenes of themaround a campfire drinking coffee.The last ten minutes are the best when a gang of bigfoots attack the campersat night, throwing boulders, howling for all they are worth, and wrecking havoc.The wise indian tracker with them says, ""It's over. We can go home now.""So that's exactly what they do. The ending song lyrics feature the phrase,""He just wants to be left alone......""So apparently the bigfoots got their wishby driving off the campers. Unfortunately, we don't get a good look at any bigfoots.Too bad we don't see any that look like the one on the cover! It's not worth watchingunless, like me, you need to see everything ever made on the subject."
3,CHEESY BUT GREAT RETRO MOVIE!,"Sometime in the mid 1970's I remember going to the local theater and watching a movie about BIGFOOT. I also remember staring at the woods on my ride home wondering if Bigfoot was in there. OK a few years late (I'm 34 years old now) and I'm glad to have had a chance to see this movie again with my 34-year-old eyes as I have looking for this movie for some time. I will admit the excitement ended about 5 mins into the movie. After that, I could not help but to think how cheesy of a movie it was. Almost to the point of being funny. The scenes that may have passed for slightly suspenseful were the ones I remembered from when I was a child. I also remembered that Sasquatch Scream!!!! In summary, great for a retro moment, but like many other good 1970s memories, they don't seem the same watching them with my 34-year-old eyes. Ah perhaps ignorance is bliss. Great for a ""retro moment"" but that's about it. Why 3 stars??? Again, GREAT RETRO MOMENT.."
3,Proof that there's strength in numbers,"Let's be honest: taken individually, these three movies leave plenty to be desired. But put them together on one disc and you have yourself a pretty entertaining night of dated freeze frames, old-school ""day for night"" scenes and men in gorilla suits terrorizing townfolk. A bargain, really."
2,"Good concept, lacks delivery","I personally thought this book was a waste of my time. The premise was promising, but Henry failed to deliver. I found myself disappointed with the 2-dimensional characterization, predictable plot turns, and lack of innovation on the author's part. This book could have been so much more. At many junctures it read like a poor imitation of David Weber's Honor Harrington. Henry needs to be able to take us deeper into the character's head, and to create characters that seem more like real people instead of just action-oriented pawns through which to move the plot along.The other thing I took issue with was the author's lack of innovation when it came to his hero's problem solving abilities. Throughout most of the book, it seemed to me as if solutions kept falling into Sinclair's lap, and many of his problems were also solved seemingly by accident or through some convenient act of serendipity.A letdown.Read Honor Harrington instead."
3,"Good, but light on practical information.","This book does a good job covering all the main sites of Moscow. The illustrations are very detailed and intense. I think it would best fit someone who is only in Moscow for a day or two, and just wants to hit a few of the touristy attractions. I bought this book, but also purchased the Fodor's guide to Moscow and St. Petersburg. Fodor's has much much more practical information - such as best days and times to see certain things, places to avoid, where to buy the best souvenirs, where to stay away from .. etc. It is also much more subjective and they offer their opinions on certain sites. This guide does not offer this subjectivity, and only offers very general and limited practical information."
4,"Very good, but....","I bought this for a business trip to Moscow, since I really do not like to arrive @ a city I have never been to before without a clue. The guide was pretty good and accurate, but honestly and without any intention of criticizing Russians, the only thing that works in Moscow is having your interpreter to go about with you."
2,Dissapointing,"Have numerous books of same : europe, Usa, South Africa and a lot of cities tooThis one hasn't been updated : some hotel, reopened since 2 yrs, still listed as closed, with wrong, old, nameSome churche, that visibly have been under construction for years, appears as open to publicRestaurant choices are rather poor and limited (compared to Rome book or Madrid book) whereas Moscow is gastronomically interesting placeMaps are inaccurate ( same as Istanbul book)So all in all, not that good a book, shame"
5,One of an excellent series of travel books,"I have used this series for other cities and have found them always excellent, the best at what they do."
4,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT","Its up to the minute information is invaluable as you travel around St. Petersburg. But, its AAA apearance is so dull you hardly want to use it. My recommendation is to buy this for the current info. and the EYEWITNESS GUIDE for its intelligent and beautifully illustrated usability."
4,Good Planning Too,It's a bit dated but it is a great planning tool for those contemplating a trip to Moscow. I recomment it for that purpose.
3,Implausible thriller.,Another story about a serial killer. This one starts wellbut loses its way. The central characters never really come to lifeand as the author searches for twist after twist it becomesmore and more implausible.
5,Great Fathers Day Gift!,"A collection of 67 humorous columns on life in the suburbs. Herb's description of what a woman should expect when sending her husband to the grocery store had my wife and I both laughing at each other - Herb really captures life. Like Dave Barry, but more on the mark. This would make a great fathers day gift. Buy it for your dad."
1,"Great rock opera, poor Rendition",This great classic rock opera was poorly directed and delivered. Quite disappointing for anyone who knows how much better it could be and has been.
4,Remember the days,I like the show very much - Great Music. It shows what times were like back then for teenagers and the draft.
2,Disappointed,"Treat Williams is a great actor and singer, and is always good in anything he does. Although the story line was good, the songs and lyrics of this movie were gross and I couldn't sit through the whole movie. If you were younger, you would probably enjoy this movie. But it was not my style of entertainment. I'm disappointed that it wasn't as good as I had always heard and that I couldn't enjoy it like I wanted to."
3,"It is good, but It could be better","I bought this book because The Editorial Review promise you ""You will learn special programming techniques"" My main goal in mind was to learn How I could create a good assemblers programs using a special system for do that. But the book Does not teach any special techniques for do this. It only show you special tricks for use the DOS and BIOS functions. It is good for you If you are a programmer with medium experience in Assembler, but It is not good if you are a Beginner. I think that the book ""Mastering Turbo Assembler"" (by Tom Swam ) is better than this... and the Tom Swam's book is for all levels."
4,"""..and then THE FIREMAN RUSHES in..""","I bought this CD on the very strength of knowing that Sir Macca is indeed The Fireman (along with Youth). I had no idea what to expect but was pleasantly surprised overall. Tracks such as ""Fluid"", ""Palo Verde"" and ""Cinnabar Appletree Amber"" are superb.It's a great trance record and I would definitely purchase The Fireman's 1993 debut ""strawberries oceans ships forest"" if I was able to get hold of a copy!Paul will continue to surprise us - no doubt about that. The man loves his music and I would certainly love another Fireman release in the future."
3,good trance music,"I really enjoyed this CD although it will not suit everyone...I sincerely like McCartney's Fireman projects better his Classical attempts...it has many interesting melodic shifts and dreamy sonic landscapes...it would fit nicely in any New Age collection...I don't know if Paul was trying to prove he is avant garde with his titles and artwork for the album...if he is, it does seem a bit staged...but on the merits of the music alone , it is a very interesting listen....if you like this, you may want to try George Harrison's ""Wonderwall Music"", which quite frankly is a more rewarding listen..."
2,Easy listening McCartney.,"If you're expecting some great McCartney music here you won't find it. This is an easy listening album. Not that interesting. Pretty repetitive. It is better than the first Fireman album, but still I expect a little more from something McCartney is associated with."
3,Cool track,now the Production&Stylings of this track are from the same team that worked with Ne Yo. Lionel Richie's vocals are still on point. this track works well on Adult Contempary radio&other formats. this styling fits what Lionel's Solo Career has been about. this is a Pretty Good track&I'm glad to see Lionel Richie back in the mix.
3,The morning sun never lasts a day,"I'm not satisfied with this item, beacause in two-three months I had half of them burned-out! 8000 hours average life - it is story about another lamps! I bought in WalMart similar bulbs: GE Energy Smart CFL Daylight Light Bulb: 26 Watt (100W Equivalent) and it was right decision! - I didn't change them more than 1 year.So, don't buy this item! consider another energy saving bulbs and you will save money not only on enegy, but also on bulbs!"
5,Essential to all teachers.,This book constitute an essential tool to all ESL teachers. It is well presented with lots of images and exercises to gradually develop the students' comprehension.
4,Good for thicking liquid meals,"If my smoothie or cereal is too thin or sweet, then I add this puffed millet; or eat it with sweet granola bars. It's also one of the very few grains that is alkaline."
1,NOT FRESH-,"I really love puffed millet and the price here was better than at the local store. However, every time I have ordered it I have received a shipment that is not very fresh and why should I buy a product and then have to place it in the oven in order to make it less stale tasting? When I buy it from the store at least it is crisp and enjoyable to eat which is the way millet should be. I have purchased this product three times but will not again-- yes, I have finally learned my lesson. IMO, cereal should not be limp until you place it in milk or other beverage."
1,Tastes terrible,"I hated this item's taste. I do like Nature's Path Puffs a lot, but these Millet Puffs I will be throwing them away."
3,Not for serious graphics,"I am not a professional graphics artist and mostly draw for pleasure. But still I find that the Graphire series is NOT for drawing purpose. I usually use Corel Painter to do my work and that Graphire series does not support tilt sensing(also limited sensitivity level compared to Intuos Series) puts major limitation to your artistic expression.If you are going to use your tablet for photo editing or quick simple writing board for presentation purpose go with the Graphire. But if you are going to be drawing Intuos is the choice. I hadn't realized how important tilt sensivity is before using Corel Painter.Concerning the size, 4X5 will work for a lot of purposes. But then again, if you are into serious drawing I would recommend 6X8. I own 4X5 Graphire tablet and the small size does not allow me to drawing straight from the computer. So I usually have to go through scanning. Take note that the area of 6X8 is actually twice that of 4X5."
5,Great Product for the Price,"Wacom has an excellent reputation, and the Graphire3 is a great product for the price. I'm not a real artist, so the use of the Graphire was more for fun than profit. I've found, though, that using the drawing tablet is so much easier than trying to create diagrams/drawings using a mouse. When used with a good graphics program this product really makes you a much better computer artist, even if you are just a hobbyist."
4,I always liked Suzy...,"and wondered why her mainstream career wasn't even bigger than it got. This is a pleasant 40 minutes or so, and merits repeat listening, but in the final analysis, it is fairly disposable pop/country. The songs are good but not ""Golden Oldies"" that you love hearing every time you can. I have owned four Suzy albums now, and none stank, but none are essential to my country collection, either. There just were too many competitive girl singers around when she had the big label record deal, and too few ""killer songs"" up for grabs. Suzy's immediate predecessor, Lacy J. Dalton, has the voice that haunts me and a catalogue of more memorable songs as well. Ms. Bogguss comes close, but just does not quite get to that level."
3,'Something'Shows Bogguss Slipping,"After two strong outings, Suzy Bogguss slipped ever so slightly with this 1993 set, which saw her writing more than on her previous records. The set opener, 'Diamonds and Tears', is the best thing here--there are some other GOOD tracks('Hey Cinderella', 'No Green Eyes', the title track), but this is the only GREAT track. 'Souvenirs' is an utter bore, strangely the worst thing here considering it was penned by the usually great Gretchen Peters. 'You Never Will' is nothing more than a futile excercise in adult contemporary sap that is far beneath Bogguss' considerable talents. The only other quibble is Bogguss' singing, usually crystal clear and expressive, but here unusually detached and occasionally emotionless--it sounds as though she's going through the motions. Overall, a notch below ACES and VOICES IN THE WIND, but still better than most of what was out at the time."
4,A Fair Overview of the Far Right in Canada,"Web of Hate is the most detailed book dealing with the far right in Canada that I've read thus far. There are a number of areas of this movement that I was unaware of, such as the involvement of Canadian racists in ""The Order"" an ultra violent offshoot of the violent Aryan Nations that was responsible for the killing of WKOA radio personality Alan Berg and, at that time, the biggest armoured car robbery in American history. It also provides more detail in the cases of Carney Nerland and the Somalia affair (members of the elite Canadian Airborne Regiment were also members of Neo-nazi organizations).Kinsella sometimes deals with this phenomena superficially, but then again he is also trying to market this book to the general public, not academics. Still, this is an area that hasn't been really explored in Canada, so this book is a good starting point for those who wish to learn more about hate groups in the Great White North (pun not intended)."
4,A Fair Overview of the Far Right in Canada,"Web of Hate is the most detailed book dealing with the far right in Canada that I've read thus far. There are a number of areas of this movement that I was unaware of, such as the involvement of Canadian racists in ""The Order"" a ultra violent off-shoot of the violent Aryan Nations that was responsible for the killing of WKOA radio personality Alan Berg and, at that time, the bigest amoured car robbery in American history. It also provides more detail in the cases of Carney Nerland and the Somolia affair (members of the elite Canadian Airborn Regiment were also members of Neo-nazi organizations).Kinsella sometimes only deals with this phenomena superficially, but then again he is also trying to market this book to the general public, not accademics. Still, this is an area that hasn't been really explored in Canada, so this book is a good starting point for those who wish to learn more about hate groups in the Great White North (pun not intended)."
1,Hilarious propaganda,"Yeah ""Web of Hate"" well watch out White canadians your a right wing hateful ""extremist"" if you actually can about your people-race-culture-nation and civilzation. Other than basically saying canadians can't do anything other than shut at whats going on to thier country and that whites should just lay down shut up and give up in these times of absolute poltics. If you want to know why stupid books like these are written read "" the culture of critique""."
3,Good point made complex,"These three essays are in fact lectures given in the late 1960s at Louisiana State University. Davis admits upfront that he used the term ""paranoid"" as a perjoritive in tracing the conspiratorial theories of both pro and anti-slavery individuals in the antebellum United States. There are good points to be made here and he does make some, but I wish he would have gotten to the sharp end of the argument more quickly instead of swirling around endless word circles. (I admit that reasonable people could mount an argument to the contrary.) These lectures are worth reading, and you can pull some ideas from them, but they are burdened by rhetorical overload."
4,"Miss Julia fans, Alert!","One of the greatest Southern characters to come along in recent years is Miss Julia. She's a hoot. If you love Miss Julia, you're going to also love a new book called The Town That Came A-Courtin'. Just finished it and I am in love, in love, in love. Didn't want it to end. There is a mama character in that book that is funny and unpredictable like Miss Julia.This current Miss Julia book is entertaining and sweet but not as strong as recent titles. Still, I hope the series continues for a long time."
4,Miss Julia--married or not?,"Miss Julia and Sam Murdoch have eloped to the Smoky Mountains and have had a family honeymoon at Dollywood. Unfortunately, there seems to be some doubt as to whether the wedding chapel preacher is really qualified to perform weddings. Since proper behavior is #1 with Miss Julia, she tells Sam that they must have separate quarters until the marriage mystery is cleared up. Meanwhile Hazel Marie, Miss Julia's erstwhile housemate, is involved in a beauty pageant which will raise money for the sheriff's department. She, Miss Julia, and the flirtatious Etta Mae Wiggins, are in charge of the pageant and the contestants, a rag-tag group of six girls which present a real challenge to their mentors. This book is not quite as much fun as its predecessors in the series, because of Miss Julia's unfounded concerns about Sam's fidelity and whether he truly wants to be married to her. Otherwise, it's the usual romp with the characters which have become to beloved in the other books."
4,Miss Julia's Beauty Shines Through,"This is the 6th installment in the Miss Julia series. All our favorite characters are here and as usual Miss Julia is in a jam! As alway it's entertaining to see what lengths she'll go to trying to keep her secrets! Maybe not the best of the series, but still fun."
4,cute innocent books,I love these books and this one was just as good as the others. Miss Julia is sweet and hilarious as she realizes that she may not legally be married to Sam. She cracks me up! The author uses great illustrations to interest the reader and as usual I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
3,predictable story line.,A little trite but cute story. I've been reading the series ever since i traveled through that area of SC. It looks just as described in the books.
4,A pleasant read,"The Miss Julia series is always a pleasant read and this book is no exception. Sometimes it is a relief to leave the world of convoluted plots, sex, and disasters to experience the sweet and amusing trials and tribulations of Miss Julia and all around her."
4,Miss Julia's School of Beauty,"I did not purchase this book for myself, but as a Christmas gift. I had recently read the book and just loved it, so I purchased it for my good friend. I just love the Miss Julia series. As usual the books are full of laughes and good life lessons. Ann B Ross always offers a good story that makes you think about your own life and how to live in a Christian manner. These books are very light hearted and you will definately take away a feel good attitude."
3,A Delightful Story,"This is a sweet story, although the title is misleading. Miss Julia stories are always pleasing to the soul."
2,Bloodhounds?,"The 20th Century Fox musicals for this era were,in my opinion, not as good as MGM products.I found this film to be bright, colourful but boring with only 2 reasonably good songs/dances."
3,As far as research methods text books go...,"Crano and Brewer are both experts in their field and know more about research methodology than I will probably be able to learn in lifetime. While the title says it is just for Social Research I would recommend this text to researchers in any field of psychology. The text uses applicable examples that help a new researcher understand a concept, which are all from social psychology, but typically have parallels in other branches pscyhology. For the most part the text is descriptive and accessible. I'll admit they make up a few of their own words, which will undoubtedly confuse students, but as long as the professor takes time to explain these confusing points students should gain a lot for the material. This no frills text (just text, nothing glamorous) will be one that any new researcher will probably dog-ear, highlight, and keep on her bookshelf until she retires."
2,Way Overpriced,"I bought this for my aging father who takes (too) many medications througout the day. The first thing I noticed was that I paid $90 for a piece of plastic with a band. That alone was reason enough to return it but as far as functionality, I am returning it because, for a senior citizen who has had a mild stroke, the alarms were too complicated to set, the alarm is too quiet and without a backlight, its difficult to read.I do like the ability to set a text reminder along with the time and record important health info. I have been searching hi and lo for an easy to use, multi-alarm watch that caters to senior citizen's needs but I dont believe one exists."
2,Not enough repetition of words,"This tape would have been much better if each word were repeated several times slowly, with time that the listener could repeat the word out loud. Longer words need to have each syllable stated separately."
2,Trying to learn arabic,"This book is ok.The problem is the lack of usefull phrases that one might need on the street.The book contains all the names of vegetables?!! I mean for god sake I'm not interested in the correct word for cucumbers!..It has some phrases in the beginning that are quiet good.The arabic language has a great amount of dialects that differs a lot from each other so i have come to the conclusion that arabic is impossible to learn.Try another language where you don't have 9 ways of saying tomorrow, why not spanish?.. Allah mAak."
4,"""Legends Bleed"" from Japan","You can tell by the song list that this is basically a shorter ""Legends Bleed"", but with one different song: ""I Don't Wanna Grow Up"". The only other reason to get it would be the cool Japanese packaging, with a completely different cover (two badazz girls instead of one), & some extra pictures (including a little cartoon of each band member) inside.I actually like the post-Ramones ramones, mostly cause they didn't change much or experiment. Maybe they know they can't. But Marky especially sounds like he thinks the Ramones are still together but with renewed energy & dirtier songs. Maybe Johnny was the problem all along as far as that goes. Of course, the Beatles & the Ramones were a group of four people each who had a special musical chemisty together, but I still welcome these solo albums & their echoes of the past."
3,"Interesting Plot, But Unrealistic","Unlike the new Sweet Valley High (SeniorYear) and SVMS (JuniorHigh) series, which have gone so ""realistic"" they are depressing, this SVU book is still following the shallow, everything-works-out plot. Shallow, as in Jessica sits and gazes at a guy's stomach and face in the first chapter, daydreaming and flirting. Also, I could predict the ending halfway through the book, although the twists with Jessica being exhausted, etc. were interesting. Finally, I am very tired of Tom. He's such a leech! And he seems too bookish and insecure. Elizabeth should either get a new boyfriend, or the author should develop the other sides of his character, as well. Finally, I actually enjoyed this novel--as an escape from reality. But anyone who reads it should realize it is not realistic. :-) Visit my site @ http://members.aol.com/skittles4christ/light.html."
5,Jessica goes to New York City,"Jessica and her friends are expelled,or whatever the word is from The Flordia Corrections center. She goes to be with Elizabeth. The lead actress bows out at the last second. One of the women from boot camp is in the F.B.I. Vanessa Pruett and one of the guys was in a crime ring or something. Jessica takes the place of the actress,and Vince Klee is on stage with her. Tom has to review Elizabeth's play. After the play,Jessica's friends from The Flordia Correction center or whatever it was called,surpise her with a visit."
4,What Ever Happend To Nick?????????,This book was ok but not that good....Elizabeth finally finished her play...it's up to you to read what happend on the play......Jessica is dating Vince...what happend to Nick???..poor Nick...Tom thought that Elizabeth like Vince.
4,Solid follow up to a great debut disc,"When I first bought this CD, I wasn't sure because I hadn't heard any of the songs, but it's been stuck in my CD player ever since. The feel of this record is louder and more rock oriented then the band's first CD ""Turn the Radio Off,"" but in some ways it's actually better. If you like ska music this is a must have."
5,"Great CD, Its got it all for ska fans","Through all of the fuss of them ""selling out"", they take a humorous approach on the subject. Some really great 2-tone beats, and even some raegae sounding beats. A must have for all ska fans. Rates up there will Hepcat. Great Band. Saw em in concert and they were great."
3,"Buy ""turn the radio off""","Maybe 3stars is not enough for this CD because it's still better than average, but turn the radio off is the best CD ever made, and this is just above average ska. Kind of dissappointing. But still, if you don't know Reel Big Fish, buy both of their CD, but listen to this one first, so you can really enjoy ttro."
4,"Great CD, But Turn The Radio off was Better.","Now that the public knows who Reel Big Fish is, people wear their shirts and know the lyrics by heart to ""Sell Out"" they may be slightly disappointed by ""Why Do They Rock So Hard?"". The first couple of songs are great, including ""The Set Up (You Need This)"" but then they start to calm down with ""I'm Cool"" and ""Song #3"". But make sure you listen to what I call ""11 minutes in a studio without Rules"" or the hidden track at the end, it's hallarious. In conclusion, ""Why Do They Rock So Hard?"" is a great collection to any Fish or Ska fan, unless they don't have ""Turn The Radio Off"" first, of course."
3,Not as good as the first,"This album is OK, but it is definetly not as good as the first. It starts out good with ""Brand New Song"" and ""Shes Famous Now"", and trails off with some really gay songs until ""Big Star"" and ""We Care"". If you want the real RBF, buy Turn the Radio Off."
5,Reel Big Fish Kicks @$$!!!!,"This CD is such a great cd, I love Turn The Radio Off too, the Reel Big Fish are just the perfect picture of awesome ska. If you're into Buck-O-Nine or Less Than Jake you'll like the RBF. They're such a great group and this cd is soooo good!!"
4,not their best,"great music, but isnt there some sort of old and revived rumor that they are a super homophobic group, or is that All?"
4,punk rawk mohawk,good cd dam good not as good as the first but close buy it it rawkssssssssssss punk rock
5,F**kin' awesome! AGAIN!,"As far as the Sophomore Jinx, it definitely DOES NOT apply here! This is probably the best follow-up from a band since I can remember, and the songs are different than ""Turn The Radio Off"". You do not find that often. I cannot say much more positive things about RBF, so I will just finish and listen to the CD again! See my review on ""TTRO"", I relay the same feelings toward ""WDTRSH"". Buy it, don't think about it, Buy it."
5,this rawks,"yall, this has to be one of the greatest albums ever made by a ska/punk group. the guitars are much more pronounced in this album (as opposed to turn the radio off), and the band has its harmonies down perfectly. this is a great cd just to dance around your room to! this band continues to amaze me, and im sure they will just get better and better. the lyrics tell it how it is, but look at life and stupid people with a sense of humor. rbf is my favorite ska band, and with good reason. just listen to the cd, and youll hear why."
4,More awesome stuff from RBF...,"Why Do They Rock So Hard? is nothing like Turn the Radio Off, but it's definately a CD you don't won't to miss. RBF still have a hint of their old ska foundation, however, on this CD they seem more like a hard rock band from the seventies than a ska band. Even though the ska/punk sound isn't so distinctive on Why do the rock... you stll know that it's a RBF album because their usual humore is still there and there a plenty of great songs like, ""Somebody Hates Me"" and ""The Set Up"". Buy this CD NOW!"
5,An all around good cd with a new sound,This cd is a good all around cd. Although its not for the traditional ska fan. Reel Big Fish's new cd is best described as alternative with horns not ska. This sound is something new and I like it. I strongly reccommend this cd to any RBF fan!!!
4,"not as good as the first, but it is still good",The only problem i have with this cd is that rbf is two caught up in what people think about them.
5,RBF is just plain incredible!!!!!!!!!,"I picked up this CD the day it came out and I must say it has been on permanent rotation since October when it came out!!!! The Set Up (You need this) is great and down in flames is hilarious as a kinda sequel to Sell Out. Everything is Cool is great live, so I suggest you buy the album, learn the words, and make sure you get to see them live and sing along. It is incredible!!!!"
4,"a great cd, but not as good as turn the radio off","this is one cd you cant miss if u are a fan of ska or not. I would really recommend buying reel big fish's previous album, turn the radio off though if you want to hear them at their best."
5,RBF-- A punk band with headstrong views,"REEL BIG FISH! Why Do They Rock So Hard? is an AWESOME album with a mix of punk and a teensy bit mix of ska. It shares the feelings of....girls, dork-dum (hey! scott's a dork!) and bein' a ""Big Star."" My personal favorite song is #11, Scott's a Dork, about a love/hate relationship where the girl walks all over the guy and then the reverse happens. Check these guys out! They are HOTTTT!"
5,The best CD I have ever heard,"This CD is incredible. Every song is great. If you like ska, you have to buy this CD."
4,what a cool buncha songs!!!,this album is great. the tunes are rockin' so hard i can barely stand it. the only thing is that a lot of the songs are too similar. the best songs are The Kids Don't Like it and Down in Flames. Ya gotta love it
4,you'll learn to love it!,"i didn't like it first the first time i listened to it all, and i went back to ""turn the radio off"" but after a few days of getting used to their new sound, it totally kicked a$$!! I thought it would be better, but oh well. i grew to love most songs, but my favs are ""thank you for not moshing"", and ""song 3"". turn it up loud, and skank your feet off kiddies!!"
5,Just as good as the first,"Why do they rock so ****** hard! I love everything about RBF. This CD shows the hard side of RBF's music. I dont know about most but the extra track shows the usual side of RBF. Song's like ""Everything is cool"" and ""The kids dont like it"" is vintage RBF. I must say it's not quite as good as the first but some songs could possibly surpass the single ""sell out"" from TURN THE RADIO OFF."
2,A poor excuse for ska...,"i'm not getting to get into all that stuff about how rbf sold out. the truth is is that this album just isn't as good as the old one. it gets old quickly. ""the kids don't like it"" and ""somebody hates me"" are the only good songs. but then again, i wouldn't necessarily call this a ska album. true to the title, it's more of a rock album with horns. it is upbeat and catchy, but it's just not the old rbf. albums that you should get instead are the aquabats, catch 22's ""keasbey nights"", hippos, ltj, or the bosstones' older stuff. or how about going out and supporting your local scene, instead of rbf, who, honest to goodness, really have sold out to be corporates, and, in doing so, made pretty poor music. i heard that in an interview one of them said how they truly are a rock band, just with horns, and have been all along. and one of the band members thanked everyone who liked ""ROCK!"" music...no wonder rbf's true fans have gone away to find better music."
1,You cant even listen!!!!,"You cant even listen to the Demos to find out if there good!!! i cant even listen to the song like ""You Dont Know"" or even ""Take on me"" THIS ALL IS BULL****"
5,IT ROCKS!!!!,Now this C.D. isn't the same RBF...that most fans are used to..but any rbf fan should love it...it has some kick stuff in it...It is friggin' awesome.....and stuff... everybody'll love the album and if RBF is going to Sell out this'll be the one....
5,*INSERT ONE LINE SUMMARY HERE*,"The one thing about his album that I think just kicks so much ass. Is that I can relate to almost everything on it (except for the stuff about being famous, which is one thing I think they shouldn't whine about). Packing an audio arsenal with songs like The Setup, Somebody Hates Me, Song #3, I Want Your Girl Friend To Be My Girlfriend Too, and Big Star this album proves exactly why Reel Big Fish rocks so hard."
1,"alls I have to say is just ""QUIT WHINNING!!""","Your first album was good with good lyrics. I have seen you in concert 3 times and every time was very good, but this CD you are whinning too much."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first","This album is good but it doesn't have the good mix of ska and punk that I liked so much in the first. I suggest you don't buy this cd if you're looking for something like ""turn the radio off"" or other ska punk albums. This does touch a little bit of ska and it sound cool when they do it but, it doesn't have as much. But, this is still a good cd it is very catchy and you will be singing these songs all day. They blend a good amount of alternative and horns which sounds cool. Basically, if you like bands such as Blink 182 (newer albums) or ""hello rockview"" from Less than Jake buy this album"
5,Excelent ska cd,Reel Big Fish have done it again on their latest album. The catchy hooks and sing-along lyrics make it one of my favorite albums. A definate must have for any ska fan. This cd is underated and will not leave you disapointed
5,I love it!,"Reel Big Fish kick some serious tail (sowwy, gotta keep it g-rated!) They totally deserve 6 stars for this cd. it is so good! if you don't own it, 1)youre stupid, and 2)go get it! ha!ha! peace out! talia"
1,wot a load of shte,this has to be their worst al(bum) that they have ever compsed and i think that they have let them selves down with this al(bum)but you dont care what the hell i think so why are you even reading this you boring little individual
1,"i think ""suck"" just about sums it up","ok, i unkowingly bought this clean version at wal-mart....it blows! like the cd isnt bad enough, they gotta take the cussing out? u want a good cd? i got one word for u: KORN!!! or even limp bizkit...and if ur mommy doesnt let u get it, well, maybe u better wait till 2nd grade"
5,One damn good CD,"To the hard core of ""the set up"" to the harmonies of ""The victory of Peter Bones"" this is one of the best damn cd's i own and i sure as hell got alot. I think it beats out ""Turn the Radio Off"" but not by much. Although they are two different kinds of records they're both the two cd's that are in my stereo the most."
5,"Even if I was not an RBF freak, I'd still spank over this","""Why do they rock so hard?"" I often ask myself that exact same question. But, to be perfectly honest, noone should expect any less of RBF. The Fish, as always, manage to make my friends and yours truly, skank like it's 1999. (sorry) I just wanna add that nobody on the planet could of done a better job of Aha's ""Take On Me."" So, Reel Big Fish: I salute you! (Scott Klopfenstein, if you ever read this- you, me and Aaron Barret- what do you say?"
5,RBF Do rock hard.,The Liquid Audio sampler makes these guys sound like they are Rock Star's. This album does Rock hard and it is a great follow up to their last release. Rock on!!! in a ska/funk way that they do.
5,A masterpiece!!!!!,Reel Big Fish has created a milestone in ska music (or any music for that matter.) Much more musical than their previous albums. Why Do They Rock So Hard combines rock and roll with ska and punk to create a sound only RBF could deliver. Every song on this album is catchy and they get stuck in my head so easily. A must have for anybody.
1,The Death of Reel Big Fish,"RBF's newest CD is the biggest let down of the year. I'll admit I thourghly enjoyed their first CD, and highly anticipated this new one. The first few times I saw them live, they kick'd $#@, but the most recent times they were lame (to full of themselves, f'ing rockstar sellouts!) and I feared their new album would suck, and it does. I gave them one star only because there is no half star option. Down in Flames is the only good song. You Need This is ok, but the vocals get all stupid and ruin it. Why do they suck so bad?"
4,"Short, but addictive","Many catchy-classic songs on here. I say classic, in that they are classic Reel Big Fish, not big-picture ""classic"". This is a must-have for a Reel Big Fish fan."
3,"Some very good info, but unorganized and choppy","This book could be a real gem, if only there was more focus and flow in its organization. I particularly like the methodologies put forth for dream analysis, and felt the book's strength is in its ""how to"" appeal. I also liked some of the background and historical perspective. I think a good editor could have re-organized and streamlined the content to make it more readable. I also did not like the frequent references to Ms. Delaney's other books. It seems like they were advertising rather than valid references."
4,Not Freud or Jung but close enough,"I have been facinated with dreams since I was a child (I think we all are fascinated with dreams) so I have read as much material on this subject, from the mystic to the more cognitive stuff. This book is really good. Not mystic but not to 'scientific' to require a PhD from Yale. It has helped me to understand why I dream what I dream and how the dreams I have at night are a way that my subconcious reveals to me the inner thoughts of my soul."
1,all about nothing,"Our reading group chose this title to look at dreams. With eager anticipation we read the book. It was amazing to me that this book was so shallow. It was written like an academic paper that received a D from her professor. Not only was the content unimaginaitive and the conclusions dubious, the typefaces of the books made it hard to read - actually distracting. I wanted to find something of value and found only psycho-babble of the most unenlightened kind. For those who believe they will better understand dreams from reading this book, beware. You will understand nothing more than you do now and will in fact be loaded down with nonsense. This is a zero star book. How did it receive five stars? Five stars....in your dreams Dr."
5,Remarkable scent,"This product has a truly remarkable scent that is remembered. You can't smell it on yourself, but others around you will compliment you. It does change its scent depending on the wearer, but it is a true musk."
3,Not Bad,"There's some interesting stuff in here, and if you're new into Steve Miller, I recommend getting this and leaving the others alone. But I do have a question and hopefully someone can answer me back on it. Where is the Steve Miller Rock Love album with ""Love Shock"" and ""Delieverance"" on it? That's a great album and all I have is my dad's scratchy copy."
2,"Easy to use, but mine drops connection often","I purchased the Microsoft Wireless G Base Station and matching PCI card for my desktop. The base station works great and is rock solid with my notebook.The Microsoft Desktop Wireless card is a different story. Sure it was easy to set up, but is constantly losing the wireless connection, forcing me to tell it to reconnect. My desktop is just on the other side of the room from the base station, so range isn't a problem. When I'm connected the software tells me I've got a Strong connection, then it just loses it every 5 minutes or so. I can't download any large files on this computer because it loses the connection too often.This baby is being exchanged for a different brand of Wireless G PCI card."
1,not very compatible.,"I have an airport extreme network which works fine with my iBook, my Motion computing wireless (intel) and even the xbox MN-740 wireless adapter. I sure couldn't get it to work with this one though. Until microsnots gets their compatibility act together, avoid this product."
2,Stingiest Man In Town - SKIPS LIKE A BAD RECORD,"I was SO disappointed. I grew up with this and have searched and searched and searched. I look every year around Christmas without fail. I couldn't believe I found it this year, and ordered it immediately. Like I said in the title, it skips like a bad record; it was obviously recorded from a bad record that skips ... skips ... skips ... skips ... skips ... skips ... skips ........"
5,Fantastic Live 2-CD Set - Worth the Price!!!,"I previously owned this CD but it was destroyed, along with all of my other cd's, in Hurricane Katrina. I had most of Aerosmith's music and this is the first one I'm replacing."
4,My First Aerosmith CD,"I was never a big fan until ""What it Takes"", but never got around to seeing the band. Now I live in Tulsa, I'll never get to see them.Over all, this is a good old fashion...Rockand Roll record. The band sounds great and I like all the songs.Most ""Live"" releases are pretty bad, exceptions being Eagles Hell Freezes Over, The Springsteen live set, and Little Feat Waiting for Columbus. My favorites anyway.A Little South Of Sanity is up there with the best."
5,"Aerosmith in the raw, True to form","Close your eyes, Crank it up, your there! This is what ROCK is all about. The mastery of Steven and the artistry of The group shines with every note."
5,Aerosmith proves why they are the gods of rock,"Aerosmith, or god, has once again shown why they are the masters of rock. They have broken another boundary by releasing the greatest live album I have ever heard. The guitars riffs and solos are just mind boggling by guitar masters Joe Perry and Brad Whitford. Steven Tyler, need I say more? Livin' on the edge alone makes this album one of Aerosmith's greatest. Livin' on the edge is one of the greatest rock songs of all time and this live version is incredible. The solo is god. This is the first Aerosmith album that combines songs from the 70's, 80's and 90's all performed live during the Get a Grip and Nine Lives tour, it doesn't get better than that! The sound quality is best I have ever heard in a live album. Any fan of rock n roll must buy this album. It is easily one of the best Aerosmith albums ever. Livin on the eeeeeeeeeeedge eeeeeeeeeeeedge eeeeeeeeeeeedge yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah dow dooooooow."
5,THE BEST ROCK N ROLL BAND JUST GOT BETTER,everyone should buy this cd. its all the songs of the past and present that have made aerosmith great. who knows i might even give it to my grandma for christmas b/c its so good.
5,Good for faffing,"I listen to this when I'm faffing in the library. I don't listen to it in French class but that's more interactive. It's good on the golf course though. Me and Eif listen to it there when we're not thinking about the female company that accompanied us the other times we played. (laughs and giggles) I also liked ""Life is Beautiful."" Me and some of the guys went to see it."
4,superb,This album is superb. Especially the numbers 1 and 3 of the first CD are my favourites.Michael De Geest
2,A tale of two Aerosmiths,"Aerosmith has been transformed.. from a great rock and roll band into a collection of aging rock stars whose main purpose in life seems to be getting all dressed up but with no musical place to go.Originally Aerosmith was synonymous with hard driving blues based rock, but sadly this album shows more of a penchant for sloppy sentimental ballads than for paint peelin' rockers.It all depends on what you are looking for. A lot of people like the new Aerosmith, with the 'sensitive' ballads, and politically correct songs like Janie's Got a Gun. Personally I liked it when they were obnoxious punks. Rock and roll was made to be played loud by angry young men. When superstars are merely going through the motions to sell records it gets a little BORING!I should probably have given this CD 3 stars, there is some good stuff here, but this is AEROSMITH! This was one of the best rock bands in the world, they should know better."
2,I had to give up on this one,"Great track list on ""A Little South Of Sanity"". I'm quite fond of Aerosmith, and I bought this double live album right after it came out. I listened to it several times, and then I sold it on eBay.I just couldn't come to terms with this CD...the noise of the crowd is way too prominent in the mix, which also manages to be both cluttered and slick, sanding away all of the grit.Sure, there are many great songs here, but they're all swamped by the hideous production. There is no separation, and the sound is just not realistic, it's synthetic and flat, and I never got to terms with it.Weird, noisy album. And not in a good way. Go for ""Live Bootleg"" instead, that one sounds like a REAL live recording."
3,Go see them live instead.,"A nice collection of the biggest Aerosmith tracks that lacks in a few areas. They should have gone back and listened to their own Classics Live releases. Most of the tracks didn't vary much from the studio versions, which would have added more value to something that is audio-only. In fact, the only track that has any special work done on it is Eat The Rich with the special intro. Also, it would have been nice if they had been able to use a live version of I Don't Want To Miss A Thing. Really, if you want the live experience, go to the show. It's way better. We even sang Happy Birthday to Joe Perry at the one I went to."
5,This is the best CD that I have ever heard,"OK, I've been an aerosmith fan for a long time, i've listened to many of their hits.THis CD wraps them all up, its by far the best CD that I own.The best songs are Love in an elevator, angel, amazing, back in the saddle, dude(looks like a lady and walk this way.The live performance makes it seem even better than in a studio, i think.If you have ever heard even 1 Aerosmith song before then buy this album, it will surprise you at how much material there is.This band is definately my favourite and I listen to it nearly every day. So BUY IT"
5,Whabam!!!!,"This album is truly the best of Aerosmith, old school and new school. This is perfect for all of the Aero-freaks out there who want the best of the best LIVE!!!"
5,BEST ROCK LIVE ALBUM EVER,"Even if you don't like ""live"" albums, you must buy this one. They are the best Rock performers EVER! Too much style, too much attitude, too much class!"
4,For Those About to Rock,"For anyone who hasn't seen Aerosmith on tour lately, here is an album for you. And for anyone who has, you'll enjoy it just as much. Ever since they've been off drugs, the band's shows have been nothing short of spectacular. This album shows you why with every song full of life.My only major complaint is that there isn't more from ""Nine Lives."" The reason is that this album was released in order to fulfill Aerosmith's contract with Geffen so they could get back to recording for Columbia. As a result, this album is just filled with all those songs we know and love off their Geffen albums plus a few that might not have deserved to be there. It would have been nicer if there were more than 2 songs off their current album, NL.However, that's not enough to get me from loving this album. With all the classic from the '70s, this is the only legal document of their tours of the past 10 years."
5,A LIVE CONCERT ALBUM DEFINTLEY WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION!,"AEROSMITH IS THE GREATEST BAND IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK. WANT PROOF? LISTEN TO THIS LIVE ALBUM AT MAXIMUM VOLUME AND ENJOY SOME OF THE GREATEST ROCK SONGS OF OUR LIFETIME. I WAS GLAD TO SEE SOME OF THE NEWER SONGS FINALLY BEING RELEASED ON A LIVE ALBUM. ""ELEVATOR"", ""FALLING IN LOVE"", AND ""WHAT IT TAKES"" ARE JUST SOME OF THE NEWER SONGS MAKING THEIR LIVE DEBUT ON THIS ALBUM. I ONLY WISH THAT ""PINK"" WOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. BUT DEPSITE THAT, I LOVE THIS ALBUM AS WELL AS I AM A DIE-HARD AEROSMITH FAN 4-LIFE. I SUGGEST YOU BUY THIS ALBUM....HANDS DOWN AND GET A GRIP!"
2,Nothin' Left but the Squeal sums it up,"Aerosmith has churned out so many hits over the years: Love in an Elevator, Cryin', Rag Doll, Angel, Janie's Got a Gun, who can't help but love them? Too bad this album sucks. I'm getting out the barbeque, inviting all my friends over, buying a cheap case of beer, and playing this album 'til the sun sets...if I'm lucky maybe someone will play air guitar."
3,Grade C+,"Having seen Aerosmith 3 times in concert I was expecting a knock down drag out cd. I saw them first on the P. VAC. tour, then on the next 2 tours afterward. I sworn them off, having only the awful ROCK AND A HARD PLACE cd. A friend took me to see them and I was impressed. But not enough to buy a cd. it wasn't untill PUMP, that I got back on board the Aerosmuth bandwagon. They never disappointed in concert,or in the studio but this cd fails to capture the magic of them on stage. I never before realized that they cussed so much either, an f word and there, does that really make for better music? The songs sound okay, and they sound like they are having fun, and playing hard, but it doesn't come across this time. Skip it."
1,You have to be joking?,"Why is everyone giving this five stars? This album is not very good. Aerosmith sound pretty crappy live and should probably just stick to studio power ballads for movie soundtracks. These guys are pretty much washed up. I saw them in concert recently and was near the front row. The band was clearly just going through the motions...it's almost like they said ""well, time to get on stage and pretend to be Aerosmith for 90 minutes"". It's too bad that Aerosmith has such a loyal fan base that they can release any piece of garbage like this, and stil have people buy it."
4,Incredible sound & second disc!!!,"Had there been a better track selection on the first disc, I would've rated this a 5-star without question. The only other complaint: No ""Train Kept A-Rollin'""?.....What were the boys thinkin?! That said, the recording is astounding. And if you love Aerosmith (what classic rock fan couldn't?), then disc #2, armed with ""Sweet Emotion,"" ""Walk This Way,"" ""Last Child,"" ""Dream On,"" ""Mama Kin,"" ""The Other Side,"" ""(Dude) Looks Like A Lady,"" and a raw, thundering version of ""Back In The Saddle,"" is worth the price by itself........An absolute steamroller!!"
4,Aerosmith in concert doing what they do best,"What's the next best thing to seeing Aerosmith in concert? How about two CDs worth of in concert performances! It reminds me of my first real rock concert in Washington D.C. on December 19th, 1998. Songs like Sweet Emotion, Mamakin, Walk on Down, Cryin, etc really stand out too. If you want to have a hint of an idea of what Aerosmith sounds like live, I suggest you buy this cd."
5,Aerosmith Does It Again!,"America's Greatest band does it again, with this two CD set extrodinaire they manage to make you feel like your sitting right in the front row of one of their concerts. This album really proves that they Live on the Edge!"
4,1982 Virago,Works perfect fits ok at best.... need a new rubber mounting gasket for application on my motorcycle (1982 Yamaha Virago 920). i figured that would be included but it was not... other than that it works great!
1,Did not get this item!,"I did not receive this item due to a ""glitch"" that showed one thing in my records and another thing on their records. I got a hammer, but it was the wrong one and for a team that I can't stand! I was told I would receive a return label, but I have not gotten one of those either. It was supposed to be gift, but it just sits in the box it came in. :("
2,Over Simplified And Outdated,"My title really boils it down. If you want to learn the amazing MIDI functionality, features and complexities of the modern digital performer program I'm sure there are some better resources around. It's better just to refer to the manual while using the program depending on what you want to accomplish with DP."
2,Not really for the well experienced,I compose extensively for performance. Hoped to get some ideas or a fresh perspective but I'll have to dig deeper than I have time. After skimming I put the book away. I may not have given it a fair shot. Maybe it is for those who have more time.
3,Buy it for Miguel,"I'll be honest and quick- I bought it for Miguel Ferrer's voice, as I love his speaking voice- and the only disappointment was that he was only the lead on four songs. all the songs seem a bit trite, more like clones of everything else out there, but Ferrer drags them out of the quagmire of influences, his voice allows them to rise above their creation and make the cd worth my purchase, although not a heavily rotated member of my collection. Miguel needs his own CD with better material, his voice is quite hot. . ."
4,"Tradition, friendship and hunting.","A thoughtful, beautifully written, almost poetic meditation on hunting, tradition, friendship, nature and human nature. It is ostensibly about rabbit hunting, but that is not where this book's meaning lies nor where the heart of its story is. Its story and meaning lie with the people, and Harrington writes in a voice so personal that you feel you know him and his family and friends. This is not a book for the PETA crowd, or for those who call rabbits ""bunnies."" If you've ever hunted, or if you understand the true nature of Nature, you'll enjoy The Everlasting Stream. (Note: This review has been written by a woman who, although she does not hunt, has shot the occasional rabbit when its depredations in her garden have become intolerable and the Hav-a-Hart trap proved ineffectual.)"
5,The Everlasting Stream,"More than just about hunting, family, and friends. A life's trip to one's past with refelections."
3,"Umm, not too great, especially for noses","This stuff is just okay. If you don't have severe allergies, then you'll probably be okay with just Claritin. However, don't expect it to treat nose allergies. I still sneeze with this stuff whenever I'm around dust and my nose just doesn't stop. I've tried Allegra too, which works better, but still, Benadryl works the best. Take it with a Coke and you'll stay awake!"
2,"Claritin Allergy 24 hour tablets, 10 mg, 45-tablets","The order for these was placed on September 17, 2012 and the expiration date is November 2012. I'm really sorry I bought these."
2,Good product - stupid price,"Claratin works very well for me but since they made it over-the-counter, they haven't done much to reduce the price to reasonable levels. They're still relaying on the brand name to generate big profits which opens the door for generics --- and the door is wide open.Try Sam's Club Loratadine. It's the same stuff and works just as well. The difference is price. The cost on Amazon for Claratin is $0.61 per table. At a retail store, you will pay about $1.00 per tablet. The Sam's Club generic is $12.48 for 360 tablets! That's $0.035 per tablet. If you take 2 tablets per day, like me, for congestion, that is a savings of $419 per year over Amazon's reduced price.This is stupid marketing by Schering-Plough. If they had priced it at something reasonable, say $0.10 per tablet, they wouldn't lose market share to generics. Greedy and stupid always loses. People are smarter than they think, right?"
2,Expiry Date too soon,Please check the Expiry Date before you buy these medicines. These guys don't give details about the Expiry Date online.
3,"Worked Fine Before, but Not Anymore","Claritin used to work for me. The pill is very small that makes it very easy to swallow. No drowsy effect which is a big plus. The first year, it was excellent. Then the following year I have to supplement Claritin with Flonase nasal spray to combat my allergy. I feel like I got immuned to it that it does not work as good as before. Also, Loratidine is now available generically for a much lower price."
2,Doen't last 24 hours and does nothing for noses...,"I don't recommend this product if your allergies include a runny, itchy nose...Also, this medication doesn't last 24 hours like it says it will and you can't take anything else with it...It does work reasonably well for itchy and watery eyes...if you want a OTC medication for your allergies...try either Benadryl ot Claritian 12 Hour...skip the 24 Hour stuff..."
5,Claritin,It is the best deal we can get for this product. It is for my grandson Nicolas who has Tuberous Sclerosis (horrible) and this product is the only one that works for allergies for him among his other multitudes of medicines. Also I received the order very quickly so thank you for that. Yvonne Kaye.
1,Might as well be sugar pills,"A brief summary based on my own experience with Claritin as well as discussions I've had with my allergist and family physician...Pros:-Won't make you drowsyCons:-Won't do anything else eitherIt's possible that Claritin works to treat very mild symptoms, but I have yet to meet anyone who has found it to be more effective than, say, wishing your allergies away."
1,Terrible,Terrible customer service. Extremely slow mail. Refuses to refund money even when the product is sent back. It is in your better interest to never use this company!
1,sleeping pill?,"I have been taking Claritin for about 4 weeks; it worked well for my allergies. Over the past several days it caused increasing drowsiness. I searched the web for information regarding this and the only place I found any mention of it was here on Amazon. I have stopped taking it, the runny nose and sneezing is nothing compared to the gray haze it caused."
1,causes restless legs,"If you suffer from restless legs, I suggest that you watch out for antihistamines such as this and benadryl. They are a known side effect. Sometimes you can't help but use them, but if you do, and you have restless legs, it might take out the mystery on why you're getting them."
2,Missing Tablets,I ordered the 45ct and there were only 42 tablets in the bottle. For this reason I do not trust this seller. I've never had a problem buying these pills from any drug store or other store. So I will not be getting them from here again. Makes me wonder where the pills are coming from.
3,"Works, but not as well as the Claritin-D","The Claritin-D seems to work better for me, at least it's far more noticeable. I guess this is effective, but not the impact of the D."
2,Very close to expiration!!!!,"I bought it from BuyBelowSale. The packaging slip has this comment: ""Comments: *****these are DATED JAN 2010***** OUR LOWER PRICES ARE BASED ON THE SLIGHTLY DAMAGED PACKAGING . SOME ITEMS WITH DATING ALSO HELPS WITH A LOWER PRICE SO PLEASE READ!! !!!!!BADLY DAMAGED PACKAGE!!!!!"".This critical information is NOT on the main page of the product. You will have to click to see from multiple buyers to read the warning.The expiration of January 2010 is just 4 months from now. So chances are I'll not be able to use the entire package beafore it expires. What a waste. So buyers beware!!!"
4,Amazon did a bait and switch,Product works fine. When I made my purchase the picture showed the package with 10 free tablets. They sent me boxes of 30 instead of 40.That made the price higher than my local store. Will not buy here again.
2,Be careful about EXP Date = 01/2010,If you click to see the seller's comments:Comments: ***THESE ARE DATED 01/2010***** OUR LOWER PRICES ARE BASED ON THE SLIGHTLY DAMAGED PACKAGING . SOME ITEMS WITH DATING ALSO HELPS WITH A LOWER PRICE SO PLEASE READ!! !!!!! DAMAGED PACKAGE!!!!!So how quickly can you consume 30 tablets? If you follow drug makers dosage 1 daily. So you may not even have time to finish the tablets before they expire.
2,Misleading information,"I experienced the same problem as another user above when I received this package, which wasn't on the site when I ordered it:The packaging slip has this comment: ""Comments: *****these are DATED MAR 2010***** OUR LOWER PRICES ARE BASED ON THE SLIGHTLY DAMAGED PACKAGING . SOME ITEMS WITH DATING ALSO HELPS WITH A LOWER PRICE SO PLEASE READ!! !!!!!BADLY DAMAGED PACKAGE!!!!!"".This critical information is NOT on the main page of the product. In addition, I didn't receive Claritin, it was Zyrtec. Hopefully it will have the same affect on allergies, but this definitely should have been listed correctly as Zyrtec and NOT Claritin. Also, it's only 4 months until they expire. This should have been listed on the ad, where it can be seen, prior to purchase, and prior to receiving the item.False Advertising from seller BuyBelowSale!:("
4,Excellent price for this item,"If Claritin works for you, then $18 for 30 of the 24-hour tablets is a very good buy. That's 60 cents a tablet. I couldn't find it for less than that considering no tax, no shipping (if order is over $25), and delivered to my door."
1,Poor design of watch band,"I puchased this watch in mid April and started wearing it in May. Soon, the pins holding the watch band together started partially slipping out, but just slightly. In mid June, one slipped out entirely and vanished.The watch is not wearable. If I replace the missing pin, another would likely fall out. Luckly, the watch band separated at my house, so at least I still have watch.Repair policy is vague and I am still not clear on course of action. I don't feel like purchasing a replacement band at my cost after such a short usage."
2,usefull until it breaks,I bought these covers for myself and a friend of mine to cover our phones because we noticed that they were getting scratched. So we thought the silicone covers would work well because they are flexible... they did work for what we wanted but then at about the same time the top on both of them broke. Now i know they were not that expensive but i would have they that they would have lasted more than a month.
4,Orishas continue their glory,This album is I would say at the same level as A Lo Cubano! The beats vary slightly but the beat is still there. Anyone who liked their first album will love this one just as much if not more. Keep on bringing the fine beats!!!
1,Very Disappointing!,"The band's previous album was one of the best albums of the year. This one, however, lacks the rythm variety. All the songs on this one sound alike with a bunch of screaming mad people. I am very disappointed."
3,Missing Flaco Pro,"Unfortunaly this more mature and rich album, follow up to their debut ""A lo cubano"", lose freshness and fun... we miss the strong and natural rap of Flaco Pro. Anyway, good effort, but not enough for the Grammy nomination."
3,El tercero será mejor!,"Pudieron esforzarse más!Perdieron un poco la pegada del Primer CD ""A lo cubano"" Creo que al darle mayor protagonismo al ""no rapero"" las canciones perdieron su fuerza, cuando en realidad la potencia del grupo está en el hip-hop, los ritmos y sonidos tradicionales afro-cubanos y la forma de expresarse de los habaneros, que te parece estar metido en la Habana, además de sus mensajes muy positivos y profundos a pesar del tono popular, el cantante entonces es excelente para darle toques a las canciones pero no para tomar el protagonismo. Pero no se extraviaron tanto porque ahí está el tema ""¿QUÉ PASA?"" lo mejor que el grupo ha hecho en su carrera y muy bueno también el video, para guardarlo para siempre, sobre todo los cubanos."
5,No one else!,"Orishas are unique! This new album is just more melodic and their talents stays intact. I do believe they can do better than this, there hasn't been another latin group in history who's albums have gone gold in three diferent countries, I don't think any other spanish-speaking rap group or solo artist can do what they do, besides they they are multilingual: Spanish, French and Yoruba, tell me, who has ever gone this far? Nobody!"
5,"asere, que bola?","orishas comes back with another amazing record!! this cd had me completely hooked!! as if ""a lo cubano"" wasn't amazing enough, the guys from orishas come back with a bang. even without flaco-pro, who had some serious skills. he left the group about 4 shows into a tour because his brother got in with some bad people in miami. he was killed, and flaco-pro turned to booze. but be on the look out for flaco, because word is he's still writing and collaborating and recording...anyway, i can't wait til ""el kilo,"" their third cd drops march 29th. i saw a video online of ""naci orishas"" (the first single) online and it's incredible!!"
5,Another must have album,"ok if you have heard the first Orishas album and loved it, then you will love this one. simple as that. the style is fantastic and they manage to keep the sound fresh. this album also seems to be a little more from the souls of the artists than the previous one was. i would not hesitate to recommend this album to anyone, it makes US/UK commercial hip-hop/ urban music sound extremely manufactured and repetitive. I have seen these guys live, and then attended an after-party with them, they are all extremely talented and have a genuine love for the music, i think that this comes out through the recording, and makes it that much better. If you don't like this album, it is probably because your stero is not good enough to experience it."
3,"You win one, you lose one...","The artist who seemed to have the most influence on their unique sound has left the group, and you can feel it on this CD. The style of rap of the remaining members seems more contrived, the melodic riffs and choruses this time around didn't move me. Nothing much stands out. The sound is still their own, but this album did not impact me the way their first one did."
1,parade your ignorance around town...,I have no problem seeing a Kerry/Edwards sticker on a car - at least those people claim to stand for something. But ANYONE but Bush? Hitler? Khomeni? Amin? al-Sadr? Anyone? I think not. This is the beacon of democracy for the world and our right to vote for our leaders is precious. So many folks aren't even registered to vote and those who are sadly make a presidential candidate into a devil or a savior. Your legislators and Senators make the laws - most folks don't even know who their representatives are and I'd venture to guess that any moron that would stick this on their car knows less about how our democratic republic system works than my dog.
4,Practical Electrocardiography Hardcover Text,"This isn't the exact edition of this book that I was looking for, but it still works. I like it better than the new edition. It is clear and eazy to read and understand. For a critical care nurse starting out I would recommend it as a basic text. The doctor I use to work with in ICU used it all the time, and he was really smart. It was one of his favorites too. Like I said, it is kind of old, so I didn't expect anything that looked new and pretty, just something that served the purpose, was eazy to read, and explained things in plain English. It's a great teaching tool."
1,Wow. Couldn't make it past the first 15 minutes,"I'm not sure who is writing these 5 Star reviews, but I suspect they have something to gain from sales of this movie. This movie was so bad I had to turn it off. It was just killing too many brain cells, which leads me to believe this movie may actually be a social experiment on the dumbing down of America. I'm not sure who would've heard the songs and lyrics in this one and green lighted the project, but I'm fairly certain they no longer have a job. Bad, bad, bad. Sure, it streams for free on your Amazon Prime account, but you'd best move on- nothing to see here."
1,"Boring, with aged actors who can't sing","Sorry i bought this dvd. The animation is equal to ren and stimpy, with Aged actors trying to sing (SHIRLEY JONES). Maybe good for kids."
2,"too dark, bad music, cute elves","I'm only giving it 2 stars because I like the retro animation. Most of this movie is dark and depressing - starts out with kids bullying a girl with a cane, spends way too much time in an awful orphanage, eventually moves to the underground place where the bad guy lives. No catchy music. Didn't like it!"
1,Stupid movie.,"Not a very good movie, maybe for under 5 years old but really not worth the money. I found the plot and the animation lackigng."
2,"Not a classic,Christians beware",I made the mistake of buying this based on others reviews. It had the potential to be a classic but... My kids kept asking me to fast forward over the parts with the villan Krag who lives in a Middle earth like domain in what looks like Hell with evil little monsters.Santas bag made from Christs swaddling clothes even bothered my seven year old. It had great animation and great voice work but to offensive for Christians.
5,Enjoyed it,I like this movie. I wached it with my sister. We love Christams movies! My favorite part was when the little girl went to the North Pole :)
2,Cute,"This book is a cute way to see if your teacher is an ""alien"".The book includes puzzles and games great for Bruce Coville fans.If you haven't read the series it's not that great."
1,disappointed,"While I'm very pleased the author, Joseph Trombello, survived the flight, I was disappointed with his book and the flight's account. I wanted to read more about the initial explosion in the engine, the anxiety of the people on the plane, the knowing they were going to likely crash. It seemed that part of the story was rushed in the first two chapters, and the rest of the book was about his meeting with other survivors and what they had to eat at these meetings. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for crash or investigation details. Trombello does do an adequate job of relating how crash survivors like himself struggle with their emotions years after the ordeal."
4,God had to be the co-pilot on this flight.,"I was so impressed with the details of the crash as I was reading that I kept turning back to where all the pictures were and after viewing the those pictures I can only say it's unbelieveable that anybody got out of that crash alive. The book keeps us informed on airline safety issues and also child restrain seats. I was interested in the book because I can remember where I was when I heard about this crash and viewed it later on the news. It does help you in terms to be more conscientious of your surroundings when you do board a plane. I would like to thank the author for bringing these things to the surface. Being in sales I travel a lot, after reading this book I can feel a whole lot better about flying about."
4,"Wonderfully Sarcastic, tongue in cheek humor","Louden is an excellent songwriter. Most of the songs on this album are a dry, sarcastic humor (""I'd Rather be Lonely"") or witty ""Suddenly it's Christmas"". ""Westchester County"", which has a sound byte above, is a good example of his singing voice.A good example of his wit is ""Suddenly It's Christmas"" ... seven weeks before the day. When they say season's greetings, they mean just what they say ..."" Or ""A Fine Celtic Name"" where he sings about the various ways his name has been misspelled. ""The Acid Song"" is hilarious even if you have never taken acid (or especially if, I guess)."
5,great salsa dance,"As my wife said, you can lose calories just listening to this music. It is get up and move around music in pure salsa style. The last two tracks fall flat, but everything up to that point is driving Salsa dance."
4,Heavy Salsa,I like this CD. Some of the songs on it really make you want to move. A good mix of tempos (slow to fast).
4,Very Interesting Report on a Little Known War,"This is a very interesting and readable history of how the USA, Canada, Serbia, France, Japan, Italy and the Czechs all fought the Soviets on Russian territory. Or at least that's what Russian history says. Some did more fighting than others. The British sank at least 2 red battleships and used tanks and planes on Russian soil. No wonder the Reds didn't trust anyone. Very readable history of a little known war not taught in schools."
5,melodious and fearless,"""Lorrach, Paris 1966"" represents selections from two concerts in November 1966 (Lorrach, Germany and Paris, France). The music is similar to ""Slug's"" and ""Greenwich Village."" It is oscillating, screaming, melodious, and fearless. I really like the percussion of Beaver Harris; in my opinion he successfully drives this music forward in a very different way than Sunny Murray. There are even some nice drum solos on this album, something I don't recall on the other 1966-67 releases. I can't really say much more about this; the music speaks for itself. This is a must-have disc for Ayler fans, and as good a place as any for an introduction."
2,Wacom Graphire 3 Tablet,"I have had this Tablet for the past four days and 'am unable to use the Software that came along with it. I tried to install the driver from the driver cd and it wouldn't load in my laptop ( toshiba protege A 200). I downloaded the driver from the Wacom website and that helped but the remaining two CDs with Photoshop Elements 2 , Corel Painter essentials 2, Photo Express 4 se and Photo Explorer 8 se basic fail to load. When I load it into my dvd drive it just fails to auto load and it does not show up in in the explore window."
5,My Most Enjoyable Part Of The Film,"To be blunt and to the point, I wasn't overly impressed by the story/acting in ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", giving the movie a 3-star review. However, my favorite part of the entire viewing experience was this soundtrack.The plinking piano, soulful strings, and aching bass easily touched my emotions more than any plot arch or character. Kudos to Kyle Eastwood (son of director Clint) for composing such a masterful score, in line with others from Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino, and Invictus."
5,Good length and high quality,"I travel a lot across european countries, so having ""their"" cable was not bad idea, considering the fact, that cable that was included with my HP laptop was short (2 feets maybe) and very thick (friends were joking - oh, you carry welding cables with you?). This one is much longer, thinner and flexible."
5,Great cookies,"I love these cookies.I like the fact that they are gluten free,organic and actually taste good.They are very crispy and go great with milk.They just need a chocolate version that is also gluten free."
2,Offensive smell and not appealing to kids,"While I personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods, I have to say the $30 I spent on this case of cookies was a waster. Neither of my children will eat them, nor will I. They have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have. Nature's Path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies. Stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay. The honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day."
3,this was not what I expected...,I didn't realize these were wheat free cookies and the corn and rice combination gave my son a stomach ache. The have a kind of sandy texture. So there weren't great for us.
4,Animal Crackers,"Shipped promply. Even though gluten free, these taste just like regular animal crackers -GOOD!"
4,"Healthy, good snack","The taste is good, they are healthy. I expected a animal cracker taste but they are good anyway."
4,kids love them,"My kids love these cookies. I was the first one to taste them and I didn't like them very much. They were slightly gritty to me and had a bit of an after taste. I was kicking myself for buying a whole case, and then my kids tasted them and thought they were great. They would give them 5 stars for sure. Just a note--the cookies are square shaped with an animal form on them. I only mention this because I was planning on replacing my GFCF son's regular animal crackers with these and I couldn't. These DO have soy in them. I know many kids, including 2 of mine, are soy free as well as gluten and milk."
5,A definitive comp of an influential Mod band,"Fans of the mod-soaked Brit invasion stuff of the Who/Kinks/Action/Small Faces universe will enjoy this lengthy CD comp.Searing guitar, snotty lyrics and Moon-esque drumming highlight this mesmerizing snapshot of the mid-60s mod era in England. The Creation is much more influential than you think today -- people even named a label after 'em (Creation Records, silly). Hey, if Pete Townshend was a member of this band's fan club, then you know they gotta rock!"
5,This is it!,"These guys were without a doubt a better mod band than the Who! Shel Talmy thought so (or something to that affect) and so do I. If you only know the Creation through ""Making Time"" (on the RUSHMORE soundtrack) this is where you can dig deeper. And it's just a start. Because there is a vol. 2!"
3,"hate to be the lone dissenter, but...","I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. This is far from revolutionary, and actually fairly derivative. These guys lean more toward Herman's Hermits than the Who or Kinks. Lot's of sing-along verses, la-la-las, etc. Fairly lightweight 60s pop that you've heard a million times before. There are a few heavier-leaning cuts (""Making Time"" is the standout), but not consistent enough to sustain it. The best thing I can say for it is that the guitar has a good crunch throughout."
3,A good initiation for would-be China hands,"If there is one thing - if not the only thing - that can be said for sure about China, it is that there is no such thing as a China expert who knows it all.For newcomers entering China and Chinese negotiations ( and as a reminder and reality check for seasoned China hands alike ), the application of Sun Tzu's ancient 36 strategies to negotiations with the modern Chinese and the insights gained are a good initiation to a better understanding "" why and how "" things in China are as they are.Studying these lessons will help the new China hands make a great leap forward on their never ending China learning curve."
4,A Compelling Musical Portrait,"John Ottman's Portrait of Terror is a compelling collection of interesting music. For horror fans, there's a couple orchestral reworkings of the driving original Halloween theme, plus echoes of other themes from Halloween and even Psycho (in the scene where Janet Leigh appears). Several other tracks are definitely creepy (Rest Stop alternates a playful theme with a menacing one). But the CD is unlike any other Halloween soundtrack. The music will appeal to the average listener because it's unique and at times experimental (Ottman fiddles around with weird sound effects and instruments). In the end the disc has more in common with Windham Hill or Hearts of Space than the score to the first Halloween. And I think it's great."
5,One of the BEST Halloween soundtracks ever!!!!!,"When I recieved this CD I was some what skeptical. I really didn't know it was all H20 untill I got it home and listened to it. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! Not only is it all H20, but it's the entire original score! I was blown away, and not to mention instantly in love, with this CD! If you are a fan of good music, and music that will leave you glancing over your shoulder, this CD is for you! Buy it now, before it is too late!!!"
5,Very nice voice,"Wow what a rich voice.. This is a nice folk cd, I really enjoy it. Too bad that more didn't come from her during that era... What a great addition to folk and sunshine history."
5,Must have for collectors,Any Sam Waterston fan should watch this film of him from his sweet bird of youth. Very unlike Jack McCoy This actor has tremendous range that was evident even back in his younger years.
3,How do you build an 80s compilation?,"Like the other four entries in the Living in Oblivion series, this disc is pretty hit and miss. There are some great, now-lost tracks here, ones that I'm happy to have on disc again (Mickey, Get It On, Lay Your Hands On Me, 88 Lines ..., some others). And then there are songs that I never heard in the 80s(and by around 1981 I was listening to a LOT of radio), and I don't think I was missing much.If I had my way, I'd try to condense the 5 CDs into 3 -- there are enough gems to fill three CDs easily, and about 2 CDs worth of songs that I would just as soon see slip back into oblivion."
3,A Puzzling Compilation,"Like the other discs in this collection, this CD has some really big hits from the 80s. Unfortunately, like the other discs, it has a lot of obscure songs that just don't deserve to be categorized as ""80s Greatest Hits."" Bananarama's ""It Ain't What You Do, It's the Way That You Do It"" is a catchy tune, but it's not even on Bananarama's own Greatest Hits CD. They had so many hits during the 80s, why include this one? I was also bothered by the Spanish edition of Mickey. The valuable disc space could have been used much more wisely. This CD has some interesting material. But to call it an 80s greatest hits collection is a stretch."
4,A Great Series Continues,"Volume 2 of the Living In Oblivion series continues the big hits/lesser knowns mix, but the inclusion of the classic Nails tune ""88 Lines About 44 Women"" makes this one worth the purchase. Throw in ""Love Missile F1-11"" and ""Heart and Soul"" and you have a great disc of 80s alternative hits. The last two tunes (Limahl's ""Neverending Story"" and Toni Basil's ""Mickey"" sung in Spanish) force this CD to go out with a whimper, but the disc is definitely worth the purchase."
3,1980's New Wave,"Correct Track Listing:1. ""Mickey"" - Toni Basil 3:362. ""Get It On (Bang A Gong)"" - The Power Station 3:433. ""Lay Your Hands On Me"" - The Thompson Twins 4:094. ""Let Me Go"" - Heaven 17 4:135. ""Love Plus One"" - Haircut One Hundred 5:366. ""Heart And Soul"" - T'Pau 4:157. ""Just Got Lucky"" - Jo Boxers 4:428. ""It Ain't What You Do (It's The Way That You Do It)"" - The Fun Boy Three; Bananarama 2:579. ""The Jam Was Moving"" - Debbie Harry 2:5810. ""Love Missile F1-11"" - Sigue Sigue Sputnik 3:4511. ""88 Lines About 44 Women"" - The Nails 4:5712. ""Only The Lonely"" - The Motels 3:1313. ""Living In A Box"" - Living In A Box 3:0314. ""Walking On Sunshine"" - Katrina & The Waves 3:5815. ""Running Up That Hill"" - Kate Bush 4:5216. ""Church Of The Poison Mind"" - Culture Club 3:3017. ""Destination Unknown"" - Missing Persons 3:4018. ""Never Ending Story"" - Limahl 3:2819. ""Mickey (Spanish Version)"" - Toni Basil 3:36"
3,Half awesome!,"The truth is, with 80's collections, the more songs it has that you want, the better it is. This ""Living In Oblivion"" series is no different. I find ""Volume 5"" to be the best, others may not. Like most of them though, I really love half of what's here, the rest is still ok. My favorites are the excellent ""Get It On (bang a gong)"", ""Lay Your Hands On Me"", ""Heart And Soul"", and ""The Jam Was Moving"". Others I'd call classic are ""Running Up That Hill"", ""Destination Unknown"", and the infamous ""Never Ending Story"". If you can find this for a few bucks, it's well worth the trip down memory lane."
4,Great disk,"""80's"" compendiums usually are code for, ""KROQ playlist"". This one's no different, and thank heaven! As in, Heaven 17, of course, and while there are a couple fillers on here (the Spanish version of ""Hey, Mickey"" is a waste of space), it's a great disc."
3,Nice hammer but had to return it,"I think it's a nice product, heavy, like the logo's. I had to return it. It was a Christmas gift and when it came in, the rubber at the bottom of the hammer wasn't connected, it had a gap and had glue showing and you couldn't take it off. I felt that the person who was in charge of shipping the product should have inspected it before sending out. That's all. Returning product was a breeze."
2,"Sketches of adolescence, ploddingly written","I was waiting for some coherent narrative...to no avail. Decently written atmospheric sketches, but they were pointless, no plot to speak of...empty air. A good writing class exercise, but other than that, it's all empty air."
3,Okay CD,"The main reason for me buying the CD was ""Lost in Music"". I first heard it from my sister's music collection never having any idea who sang it until going through amazon.com and listening to a sample couple of years ago. I have been dying to get the song and now that I know that it is Sister Sledge, I can listen to it as much as I feel like. Their most recognizable songs are ""We Are Family"" and ""He's the Greatest Dancer"", which are played often. Some of the other songs that I have never heard of were okay. ""Frankie"" is too awful to listen to! Apart from that, the CD is good to listen to."
4,Superman: the Music,"The cd arrived in good condition and it does sound wonderful. I think the music is beautiful. Superman, the movie was a good story and this music is a wonderful accompaniement."
1,DISAPOINTED,I assumed that this book would of provided more usefull information. My daughter was just given this curel diagonise and I am looking for help and answers. All this book gave was incorrect web sites and a carbon copy of the same information I was able to find with simple web searches. This book is of no help so do not waste your time. My heart goes out to any one who is in care of a child with this. I wish I could provide support.
3,Review by Aleshia,"I liked the book becuase you were meeting someone new! L ike when Brogeen meets the old lady named Mary and they become really good friends! It keeps you on your toes, around every turn there is somethings new. It's a very intersting book!I think the best part is when Brogeen finds the fiddler again after all he had been trough, and hears him play a song and realizes that he really does hve a tune and does not worrie any more!I liked how there were always new people,everything wasen't the same thing over an over again,it was really good in that way! Every time there is a new chapter there in a new person to get to know! The theme of the book was really good and it stayed on one topic the whole time,it was always tied into how Brogeen was trying to find the fiddler to see if he really did have a tune,well it turns out that he did have a tune."
1,Not what I expected,"I've liked Tanya's music for a long time, she has a great strong voice. So I bought this album without listening first, I should not have. This one doesn't even come close to her other albums! This is the only album I'm going to forget SOON."
2,Not the two CDs to represent The Beatles in one's collection,"I can't help but feel a little ripped off by Past Masters 1 & 2. It's packaged like a Greatest Hits -- at least that's what I thought. Yeah, there are some hits on it, but they're few and far between."
5,nice collection,"what's there not to love on this? Best cuts are: Love Me Do, From Me To You, I'm Down, Yes It Is, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, She Loves You, I Feel Fine, I'll Get You, Bad Boy, and This Boy & Long Tall Sally. Nothing on here sucks. The only two I might kinda consider to be 'filler' would be the German versions of She Loves You and I Wanna Hold You Hand."
4,A must have!,It brings back so many memories! It is great to have all of these songs in one collection. I recommend it to any Beatle lover.
4,good collection of early Beatles,"I bought this CD because it has several tunes on it that are very hard to find elsewhere. It is early times Beatles, so if that is what you like best go for it. You won't be dissapointed."
3,Let down by inclusion of german tracks,"PAST MASTERS is not exactly what the title suggests. This CD (the first in the PAST MASTERS set) is made up of B-sides, and non album singles. I remember my mother buying it because she thought it was a 'greatest hits' package. It is worth a listen, but beware that the german inclusion of two of the key tracks are the german versions. These two versions should have been laid to rest, and not allowed to resurface on CD."
4,A Good and Worthwhile Housecleaning,"As the liners point out, this is a helpful way to pick up a lot of the Beatles work that isn't available on CD elsewhere. Most of the hits (on this volume, anyway) is available on the ""red"" 1963- 1966 CDs, but you also get such goodies as ""I'm Down"", ""Long Tall Sally"", ""Bad Boy"", and ""She's a Woman"". Yeah, there's some less-than-essential stuff here (the German numbers, for instance), but they'll certainly be appreciated by completists. Worthwhile early Beatles items."
5,a great collection of non album single-tracks and b-sides,"This and Past Masters vol. 2 are absolutly essential to any Beatles fans. Vol 1. includes such Beatles classics as I Want To Hold Your Hand,She Loves You, I Fell Fine,From Me To You and even a different version of Love Me Do with Ringo drumming. But thats not it Pauls cover of Long Tall Sally puts Little Richards original to shame, as of a lot of the Beatles covers (ie: Twist and Shout,Money,Dizzy Miss Lizzy). I Call Your Name, Slowdown, Im Down, and She's A Woman are great rockers (FIRST TWO are COVERS). This Boy and Yes it is are great ballads. Overall I reccommend this and vol. 2 LOTS OF HITS ON VOL 2."
5,Classic Beatles,"Great collection of songs that I'm so glad have place to call home on a ""real"" Beatles album. For those of you who don't know what the Past Master's series are, they are all the songs that The Beatles produced that were only released on singles, not on an album. And this is of course referring to the albums released in the UK (the only ones that really matter). So many great songs. I love it and i was super excited i didn't have to get every single lame American version albums to get own every Beatles song recorded."
3,2.5 stars: Good scenery; decent acting; writing fell completely flat,"This was a decent movie. It will entertain you. But -- there are a lot of problems. It was far too long. The story could have been resolved by shaving 25 minutes off of the film. Also, the ending was a rip-off of The Mist. I saw it coming. Bleh. Additional risks would have helped move the story along. Seeing the same domesticated dogs (supposedly wolves) circling them the entire film became boring.As other reviewers have said, the acting saved this. I agree."
3,Half & half film,"This is one of those films that almost lost me due to it's terrible beginning. A crushingly slow B movie was in full play when a change suddenly took place. The undeserving husband adopted a more believable face towards survival and the wife's portrayals of frustration acurately increased. The viewer now gets to see a man and wife trapped in an unforgiving expanse, leading to some fresh turns. Interesting action along with life lessons made what could have been a run away bomb entertaining. A good, reasonably thought out ending really helped. A nice little tricky survival film that may fit your mood when the video idea well runs dry."
3,NOT SO GRAND CANYON,"PROS:*Strong performances from Yvonne Strahovski and Eion Bailey*Beautiful scenery*Tense wolf scenesCONS:*Will Patton's role too short*Tedious at times*Characters stupid decisions*Preposterous ending---why no CPR?*Misleading promo as a ""horror"" movieSUMMARY: Performances save an otherwise routine movie."
3,Don't watch before going to the Grand Canyon,I watched this movie after successfully hiking the Grand Canton. Scary movie but a bit ridiculous at some parts. Glad I am not them!!!
3,very good for what it is...,"As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service (and President Kennedy's interaction with the agency), I was much interested in this book by Jack Rudman. That said, it is a very dry, clinical book (5 stars for content, 2-3 stars for ""readability"": it's for those wishing to join the UD---Uniformed Division---of the USSS!). Hey, current SAIC of PPD (for George W. Bush) Nick Trotta started out this way---the UD division is very important. vince palamara"
5,"A ""Win-Win!"" Piece of Sanity!","It is insane to belly-ache about gasoline prices but then readily pay $20-$30 for a one-fourth CUP of ink!!! This device is excellent!!! It allows me to use ink, purchased in bulk, in my perfectly good cartridges, by resetting the ""odometer"". I save money (for gas!) and can refill at home whenever the need arises! Win-Win!"
5,Best price for great product!,Searched a lot of stores during the holidays for an acoustic/electric guitar and the prices were ridiculous. Never used Amazon before but when my son saw this guitar he begged me to try it out. When I saw the dusk sun red finish it was beautiful. With the money I saved rushed out and bought a case for it. Great gift for a great price.
1,"I liked the voice of Linda, but not the other things ....","After having read a lot of reviews about this cd and i talked my self into buying it. What a mistake that was. I think Linda has a good voice, one that you will want to listen to, over and over, without burn out. The song selection for this cd was ok. Now comes the bad news. The band that backed up Linda was not the kind of band i enjoy listening to. For one thing, they used a lot of heavy rhythm. Also they used a lot of electronic instrumentation. I'm an acoustic fan, and i love to hear this kind of sound.All in all i'm rather disapppointed in this cd. I think it could have and should have been a lot better.I Can Not Recommend This Cd"
2,Unusual...,"It is a little embarassing to hear the beautiful and talented linda Purl attempt Bachrach's standard, ""This Guy's..."". The music is quite good, but the selections are very marginal."
3,Nice but could be better,"Like many others, I know Linda Purl as a very likeable actress. This CD surprised me. The woman has a voice with a WILD range - she's all over the place! - and I like the song selection. I did not care for a lot of the arrangements - lots of loud heavy instrumentation intruding all over her singing. The arrangement for ALONE TOGETHER, in particular, I found annoying. Much too busy - just let her sing! Still, it's an interesting CD and one that I think fans of female vocalists would find at least charming if not outstanding. I'll buy another Linda Purl CD in the future unless I see she uses the same arranger! (Since I wrote that review I've been listening to this A LOT and must add that, some arrangements aside, the songs HOLD ME... and I CAN LET GO NOW are very well sung and are the highlights of this recording - excellent!)"
4,Art of Flowering Bonsai,Book was very informative on different types of Flowering trees used as Bonsai. Much of this information is not found in basic or general Bonsai books. I only wish there would have been more specfic info on a few more trees.
4,Beautifully illustrated and very helpful: 4.5 stars,I highly recommend this book to other bonsai-ists. It's worth the price for the illustratons.
4,great prooduct,I but it on my 2006 Harley 1200 sportster low. Everyone has them screamin eagle big cones. SO i wanted to go with somethig different. I 've got alot of compliments on. It adds a little more pep and it looks bad ass. It was a little difficult to install because I tried the way the instruction told me to but it didnt work that way. I had to figre out a different way but it fit. You may have to do the same.
2,silicone cover and belt clip,they sent first the silicone cover and because of a mistake they sent after the removable beltclip so i had topay double shipping to paraguay
4,Harm's Way,"I enjoyed this movie. There are weak females and strong,just the right combination to piss you off."
5,God changed my life through this book.,"I must say that besides the Bible, this has got to be the most powerful book I have ever read. I could sense the heavy anointing on the book by page 9 as I sat and wept. I knew God had nailed me. When He first told me I had strongholds, I didn't really understand what a stronghold was. I thought that it was some evil power that lurked over a city but God showed me differently through this book. He taught me all about mind sets and the scripture really came to life for me, ""As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."" Plain and simple. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is seriously pursuing a relationship with God. This book demands change in your life and is not for the carnal christian. Thank you for reading my review and may God bless you as He has me. In Christ!"
5,Life Changing,"I believe this book can be a ""key"" to the Abundant life with Jesus that so many of us have been looking for diligently but has seemed to evade us. I have studied scripture with a seeking heart for 15 years and always seemed to fall back into self condemnation and guilt when I failed. This book truely offers scripture and practical discipline for seeking God everyday and making room in our full lives for His saving grace through Jesus by binding ourselves to HIm and loosing our soulish agendas."
5,Shattering Your Strongholds,"I had already enjoyed the orignal print and I thought that it was a good book. I am disappointed for when I was ordering the books it was showed as the new expanded version, but that was not what I received. I ordered more than four copies and only recieved one of the new versions."
5,Do you need victory over problems in your life?,"I'm only 2/3 of the way through this book, and already the Lord has used it as a tool to powerfully change my life! I have been a Christian for over 12 years, and spent the last 10 of them unhappy and confused. Yes, I attended a wonderful church regularly, read the Bible, and did every Bible study offered! But I just kept asking God ""Where is this abundant life You've been promising me?!"" Liberty has taught me how I have actually opposed myself by opposing the work the LORD was wanting to do in my life because of the strongholds I have built up around old hurts and lies I've believed about myself and about God! If you've got problems, habits, depression, etc. that you just don't seem to be able to get victory over, this book is definitely for you! First, absolute repentance is crucial (I highly recommend ""Prayer Portions"" by Sylvia Gunter), then learn how to pray to be set free by ""shattering your strongholds"", and give the battle to the LORD!"
4,Give this book a real chance,"While I don't claim to be any sort of biblical scholar, I will say I've never seen the idea of binding and loosing presented the way this book has. That said, I would say to the point that some of the other reviewers have made, regardless of weather or not the scripture has been used or even interpreted in the right text there is a great deal of value and growth that can be taken from this book - none of which I find to be unscriptural."
2,Somewhat Helpful,"A look inside this book before purchasing would've been helpful so the reader could ascertain whether or not it would be more helpful than, say, ""Healing of the Wounded Spirit"" and other books by John and Paula Sandford. It is not as helpful, IMHOP.Also, this paperback was sold as a new book. It is not; it is a used book, evidenced by some underlining in the book."
5,Incredible!,"Most powerful book other than the Bible that I have ever read. If you want your life to change and help others too- read this book on the keys God gives us in His word. Savard has incredible teaching in here that can only be explained as great revelation from the heart of God to help His people! Yeah Dr. Savard! Thank you for being brave enough to ""teach"" ie write about the keys! LIFE CHANGING!"
3,not what was pictured,"When I ordered this book I assumed it would be the new and revised version of it because that is what the picture on the front of the book said. Instead, I got the 1998 printing- not the 2005 printing. I am not pleased because I wanted the newer version. Also, it was promised to me on Septemeber 9th and it did not come until the 13th."
5,Prayer Works,"This book is so true to life. It uplifts you and if you use the workbook, it helps you learn in detail how to be free. God is always working when you ask him to be a teammate. In our little group, we have seen these prayers work. It is amazing. I recommend this for everyone, even people who think they are right with God. You don't realize how your strongholds of yesterday years have a grasp on you. I 100% recommend this book along with the workbook. It is really nice if you can get a study group to do it together."
2,"Very dusty, don't recommend to use for pet fountains",I bought this to use with a pet fountain where I bought a reusable filter. I found that the charcoal is VERY dusty and clogs up the filter. Every 3 or so days I find myself having to either replace the charcoal or clean out the filter.
4,Good carbon,"I don't normally buy items through Amazon that aren't stocked and shipped by Amazon directly, but in this case, since I know the product, I thought I would give Big Edge a try.Maybe it's a once in a blue moon event, but the shipment came late and with the wrong sized container. I received the 40 oz container instead of the 68 oz container and it took about a week to be delivered - vs the 2nd day delivery I was expecting.I've seldom had problems with items supplied directly by Amazon, but my experience with 3rd party vendors has been checkered. In this case, Big Edge came issued a credit for half the purchase amount, and did so promptly.I've been using Marineland Carbon in both my planted freshwater tanks and can't complain. I replace the entire contents of my Magnum 350 filter cannister monthly and the fish seem to be all the happier for it. The neon tetras in one tank are now four years old. That says volumes about the water quality, no?Good luck."
2,Ash can make your water BLACK,"With all those great reviews, I am sorry to say from my personal experience with this ""high grade"" carbon.When compared with other carbons by just looking at them (with a very popular carbon that starts with F), this product is pitch black as compared to light grey. Well it is carbon you say, well the other carbon is not as black and doesn't need as much as a gallon of water to get clear. There's so much ash its not even funny.Customer service from the manufacturer is none existent. I wrote an email and no one replied yet.For all the fish owners out there, high quality carbon is with less than 2% ash count. When these real high quality carbons can lower your PH to 6.2 (since they are rinsed with acid to clear the ashes), its something you can fix with a product call PH UP. So high quality carbon and PH UP is a combo you must have when changing carbon."
5,This player is well built on the inside and out!,"This is one great player. It is a large and heavy unit compared to other players in this price range, but I venture to say it will be around a lot longer. The tray is good and solid too. Just as importantly the picture and sound are great and it plays everything I've thrown at it. It also has a display and a super easy to follow manual. My son is returning his Norcent. No comparison in quality! Anyone interested can now pick it up at arguselectronics.com for 59.95 or data.vis.com (DataVision) for 59.99."
5,What a DVD Player,I've wanted a second DVD player for the TV in our bedroom for a long time but didn't want to spend a fortune. When I saw this CyberHome DVD on your site and noticed it had all the same features as players twice the price I couldn't resist. It's been great to curl up on cold nights and be able to watch movies in bed!
5,This is a great DVD player,This is a really good DVD player. The low price is the best but the picture and sound quality is the better than other manufaturers. This can play all region DVD and even mpeg movies. That is very helpful.I becomes a fan of Cyberhome.
1,Part did not match the vehicle it said it did. Was charged to return item when it was incorrect info on 2004 F-150 Lariat 4x4.,Was disapointed in Amazons charge for returning merchandise when info on my truck for this part was incorrect. Since this was the first time I have changed the pads on this truck I wasn't sure of what the ends looked like and even if I did is the picture of the part correct. The problem I could see was when I was asked questions about my truck it only asked what year 2004 what make Ford and what model F-150. My truck is a Lariat 4x4 with 6 lugs which was not asked. Had looked at a cheaper set and it said to look at these. I figured at $10.00 more at this point was a better idea. Not really in hind sight.
5,Perfect Pop Period.,"Just as great as the best of The Beach Boys, Queen, The Beatles, XTC, Joe Jackson (and Michael for that matter), Prince, or Robyn Hitchcock. All of the praise that these boys have received is well deserved. By far without any hesitation this is the best of the best pop ever written. Buy now!"
5,Brilliant,"What a brilliant album what a great band, what shame they broke up, this album deserves 10 out of 5. Do your self a favour go to EBay and search for Jellyfish under video/dvd there is some great lives show with this band."
5,For true music fans,"It's sad that today's music is clearly formulated for success ala' American Idol-style of talent discovery. Spilt Milk is what talent should be doing today - writng their own music for the sake of the song and not sales. This CD does contain more hooks than a tackle box and, contrary to the other reviewers whose closed-minded reviews are clearly living in the past, these guys are great musicians and song writers. I haven't heard versatility like this since the Beatles. Highly, highly, highly recommended!"
3,bgdglvr23,"I bought this music to listen to something different that I've not heard and it is OK, not really my style, but maybe I'm too young to like it. Music is upbeat and happy, just not my style. Hey at least I'm branching out."
5,The Best Pop-Rock Album to Date,"A carnival of sounds that contains the magic we all felt on Christmas morning as children. A forgotten memory, a dream,a cartoonish ride that leaves a lasting imprint. Sorely missed..."
5,What A Phenomenal Record,"This is far the best album I have heard in the 90's. This is an amazing musical Jellyfish journey. This CD takes you on a ride and you'll love every minute of it until the CD ends. From the opening ""Hush"" to the closing ""Brighter Day"" the band brings you through many different musical styles. You can definitely hear the musical influences of such bands as Queen and The Beatles. This is also the perfect Desert Island Disc. Enjoy it to the fullest. You will never be disappointed when hearing Spilt Milk. You won't cry either."
2,Disappointing,"From reading all the gushing reviews I was expecting a power pop masterpiece along the lines of their previous album, ""Bellybutton"" (it's wonderful!) but instead I hear warmed over Supertramp meets The Little River Band lite rock. I was excited to find a used copy and have given it a few months/spins to make an impression but I will be trading it in for something more worthy of my time. What a disappointment!"
2,Not one original idea on this album!,"I was surprised to read the glowing reviews on Amazon for this album given that there literally isn't one original idea with any of the songs on the entire CD.Its a masterpiece in production but I would put it in the same category as The Rutles or maybe Todd Rundgren's Beatle spoof (Utopia) Deface The Music.The ""send ups"" of Queen, The Beach Boys and The Beatles are brilliant, but is this how we now rate music these days?Excellent playing, beautifully recorded but rather than simply be inspired by their heros, Jellyfish just created carbon copies of their sings hoping that perhaps a younger audience might not make the connection."
1,No use cryiing...,"Most music listeners have asked themselves the question ""What would ASIA sound like if they decided to cover the Ohio Express after being trapped in a closet hearing nothing but ""Pet Sounds,"" ""Abbey Road"" and ""A Night at the Opera"" for ten years? The answer: Jellyfish.Here's another clue for you all: The Walrus was Paul. And imitating (or blatantly RIPPING OFF) good bands doesn't make you a good band. This album is SOOO limit of delta x as delta x approaches zero of function x plus delta x minus function x divided by delta x (i.e. DERIVATIVE), you can almost quote the inadvertant references line by line.""Ghost of Number One"" reminds me of a really ""killer"" Queen tune. I can't remember the name of it. The bridge is an EXACT copy of the theme to The Guiding Light.If making a good Dukes of Stratosphear album was Jellyfish's intention, a parody of pop and psychedica, they succeeded. If it was to make a real and not a cartoon characture of an album... well, no use crying."
1,This is not good,"Wow. This is terrible. After hearing of this band for years and reading all the glowing reviews of their two albums I had decent expectations for listening to Split Milk. I must not have the same ears as the other reviewers on amazon.com as I think this is album is a poor amalgam of it's 60's and 70's influences: Beatles, Moody Blues, Beach Boys, Eno's Roxy Music, Badfinger, et al. It's derivitive, tiring and pompous. I already own CD's by The Flaming Lips, XTC/Dukes of Stratosphere, Divine Comedy, Pink Floyd, Starlight Mints, Beck, ELO, Queen, and Moxy Fruvous. Save yourself some dough and buy something by one of these artists - they all are better musicians and use the same influences to make something fresh and new. Wow."
5,Sounds Like The Genius Offspring of XTC and Queen,"If you like richly layered pop you have to buy this. The first time I heard this CD it literally left me with my mouth hanging open. The writing, singing, playing, arrangments, production...even the artwork...is nothing less than brilliant. It should go down as one of the best CD's of the decade.That these guys weren't HUGE is a tragedy of Big Starian proportions. Listen to the sample clips, then hit the 1-Click button. My Gawd, what an incredible album!!!"
5,Pure joy,I listen to this album over and over at work--I just feel so happy when it's playing. Definitely an album you'll be interested in if you're a Queen fan.
5,this CD is one of the best Metal CD's out,"I ordered this CD and many people will probably be surprised. I have all 3 korn CD's and i have limp biskit, and if you ask me this on tops them both. I also have ICP, and if you like the rythm in there songs, then you'll love this rythm. Many Heavy metal fans hate ICP, but i like them and if you put the mixture of the rythm in there songs with the metal guitar and metal voice of vanilla ice, then you get this CD. To put it in plain and simple words...DO NOT PASS THIS CD UP. IT IS AWESOME"
1,Everything that's wrong with music,"OK, look. There's a lot of reviews here that say that Ice has finally come into his own, it's a blend of rock and rap, yadda yadda yadda. But the fact is that Vanilla Ica is still Vanilla Ice, and nothing, not even a bad-mutha makeover will change that. This new disc is just more of the same from a guy who's just more of the same. Gone are the sparkly pants, here are the pretentious pseudo-Beastie Boys rock/rap synthesized tracks that make you long for ""Havin' A Roni""."
4,Vanilla Ice Rocks,"I like the way he made the Ice Ice Baby remix (Too COld). I hope this album does well. I only give it 4 stars cause it's not exactly the Ice I love. However, that was a smart move for him considering it was his comback. Oh yeah John, VANILLA ICE SAMPLED FROM QUEEN, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND."
1,please it is Vanilla Ice,"If any of you are Kid Rock fans you should be ashamed of yourself for buying this crap! Vanilla Ice is a fake, and will never get his respect back! If he ever had it. Go buy EPMD's new cd tight as hell!"
2,"Ain't No, Ain't No ""Mind Blow'n""","Vanilla, I love your music and glad to see you're still crank'n out the tunes, but damn, this album isn't bad....its just unlistenable. Oh well, peep."
1,there is no zero listed.,The ice is still vanilla. This was like waiting for the comeback of Tiny Tim. Can you spell r-e-t-i-r-e?
4,Ross Robinson can do magic?,"The very talented producer of Korn and Limp Bizkit, Ross Robinson, has managed unleash the new Vanilla Ice on us and the funniest thing is that it isn't that bad. Infact, It's actually awesome. His killer rendition of ""Ice Ice Baby"" belongs in the pit, and ""Snafu"" is as bad as it gets. And while ""Zig Zag Stories"" is neccesary, it still just seems like a stoner throwaway. With Ross blessing this as part of the ""New Breed"" Ice is able to (almost) rival Fred Durst for MC skills and is definatly harder than Kid Rock. Ultimatly, Ice throws together a glimpse of his new found self. And I'm dying to see how far he goes with it."
3,hard to swallow,"If you are a big fan of Korn, Slipknot and Limp Bizkit, I can guarantee you gonna like this. It's far away from Vanilla's first album Go To The Extreme which is more like Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch. So if you like the old Vanilla your going to be dissapointed. I like this album cause im a fan of Korn and Limp Bizkit. I gave this 3 stars cause the genre is not my favorite style. I like hardrock and metal very much but rapmetal is ok."
4,Like Limp Bizkit,"Like bizkit, but with vanilla ice's personnal touch. Buy the album. Go see him live."
4,Maybe if you drop the name ????,"DUDE !!! The name will always come back to haunt you, even though VANILLA ICE is a house hold name. I feel if you are going to change the style change the name too. Start off "" FRESH "".The music is killer. I think the music the better then KID ROCK. But the lyrics were too predictable. I rate this CD 4 stars just because of the music.It's too bad what in Salt Lake City. All those damn Straight Edgers and rowdy Mormons.......... (but it was alot of fun)."
2,Korn? Try early Rage Against the Machine...,"I heard this through the internet all the way in Japan, so maybe I am not totally on, but at first listen it sounds like Public Enemy, Rage Against the Machine and The Backstreet Boys had a child. He's trying SO hard to be tough and have an image, but he is just jumping the band wagon about 2 years too late, as ususal. Kudos for making the album anyway, thus the 2 1/2 stars."
1,Ummm...The whole album is really BAD!,"Please, don't buy this album the entire thing stinks. I wasted my money to buy it when I could have bought something much better...Like a N64 game. I only gave it one star because the ratings don't go down any further."
1,Vanilla Ice is a burn out wannabe,I borrowed this cd from a friend and when I listened to it I was disgusted. He's just a KoRn - LiMP BiZKIT wannabe. Nobody will ever be as good as them. He needs to stop obsessin about himself and get a life. I recommend not buyin this cd and go buy KoRn. Their music is real and not some dead beat crap like Vanilla
1,"Boy, I wish there was a 0 stars","Oh man, I bought this one for humor value, and it lost its novelty in about three seconds. Ice ice baby remix indeed."
1,Fashion Victim,"Poor Vanilla, he just had to do it. How ridiculous can an artist become? This is blatant rip off of the new metal stuff like Korn and the Deftones. What's next for Vanilla? And when the Korn trend is gone? Is he going to ""Follow the leader""? Or the new leader of the fashion that will come? This so-called ""artist"" is not even true to his own music roots. Capitalism at it's uglyest"
3,Not as bad as his other album,"Ok, well folks, It seems that once again I have to step in and set the record straight...This is not a *Metal* album....it's not even a ROCK/RAP album...this new Vanilla Ice is a ""HARD CORE"" album...it's a style of music from New york, that has gained popularity in L.A. and many other U.S. Cities as well as up here in Canada. Vanilla Ice is basiclly doing what Ice T did with ""Body Count"" and using his name to sell records with a gimmick (don't mind my spelling) Now don't get me wrong....I have a few body count albums, and I listen to them from time to time, and I like this new vanilla ice album, but one thing is for certian...This is not even CLOSE to the best hard core our there. Anyhow, it was a good first attempt at harcore, and I hope that his second attempt is as good or better....SsSmeagol"
5,Here Comes The Hammer!,"Vanilla Ice is an original, always was, always have been. His bassline for Ice Ice Baby, later nicked by second-rate artists like Queen, struck me as one of the most hauntingly effective musical sounds ever conceived by a human being. Normally I only listen to '50s-type music and the fact that Ice has touched me so deep, must mean his roots are pretty deep as well. Of course, The H Song and F Me readily express his interest in doo-wop and the Andrew Sisters (all three of them); and his flirtations with heavy metal on the opening track should have Axl Rose drooling all over himself. The deeply disturbing ballad about John Lennon, Prozac, is very profound and reveals some shocking facts about Ice's relationship with the former Beatle and his musical debt to Yoko. As the new millennium is now in full effect no-one is more relevant than Vanilla Ice. His new album, Seasons Of Grass, is due next month. Start pre-ordering now!"
1,"Oh for the love of God Vanilla, let it go!","Another example of a career in decline. But Vanilla seems not to grasp the reality of the situation. Well, it will be interesting to watch the slow painful slide into obscurity, where I might add, he and his music belong."
5,"who cares if the singer's a poser, they rule","the band is made of some great artists like Sonny from Snot, the whole band Amen, and the keyboardist from limp bizkit. vanilla ice is a musical genius too, his singing is great(although the similes get annoying after a while). the album is like Limp Bizkit's 3 dolla bill yall(not like limps other albums, which suck), but darker and heavier. definately a good buy, some great songs, just dont pay attention to the singer if the early 90's offend you."
3,"i'm not rating this album, but.....",why doesn't everyone just stop bickering and go out and buy some Radiohead.......
2,"Instruments rock, tempo is fast, the rest is lousy","Sorry VN, but you weren't a very good rapper and apparently things haven't changed much. I do respect your efforts, but that doesn't save the album. The anger projected on the record sounds sincere but it's not geniune. The lyrics sound contrived, to thought out and it doesn't have a natural flow. The musicians on the record are the only saving grace and at times carry the songs to an acceptable level only to be brought back down again by the vocals. I really wanted to like this album because I think everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves, but alas VN fails to do this and the album is truly ""Hard to Swallow""."
4,"no one line summary, thank you...","Ok, ok, so it's Vanilla Ice. But it's alot better than Ice Ice Baby (though a new ""hardcore"" version of that song is included). It was made at Indigo Ranch (where Three Dollar Bill, Y'all was produced)and has the ""Indigo feel"" to it. But it's not Korn, It's not Limp Bizkit, it's Vanilla Ice! Yes, I got razzed from friends of mine for buying this, until I made them listen to it. Most agreed with me that this is what Van Winkle needs to be doing. And he seems to do it well."
3,an awlright attempt for an artist i can never forgive.,"This album has it's moments, but it sounds nothing like Korn so stop name dropping. Some dull moments thrown in as well. The other bad part is that thsi album is by Vanilla Ice, who used to be a wannabe white rapper. belive me, nothing makes me more angry than a white guy trying to act like a ""G"". and that is what Vanila ice, or Rob Van Winkle used to do. Buy this album if you want some bad a some good parts."
4,Cool Cd. I would recomend buying this.,Popped the cd in between commercials during a tv show just to listen to a sample and played the whole cd front to back. Kind of like Kid Rock meets Nine Inch Nails with Ice's own very original sound. Very cool w**d song called Zig Zag Stories and an incredible remake of ice ice baby that will give you a whole new perspective of the song. Good solid cd with the the best song Prozac which is awesome.
1,vanilla ice gone crazy,"vanilla ice doesnt rap anymore , now he s gone metal but i miss his old hair and clothes"
3,I give him respect,"While This CD is not original or a new sound. It still works, I would liesten to it often actualy. Its not the best! but it just works. I hated the original ice, the only cool thing about the original ice was when he talked about 5.0's!400hp 5.0 in the house!"
5,We were greatly surprised,"Vanilla ice is pretty cool. We(korn)met him in N.Y. a while ago and he seemed down to earth. We asked him for a copy of his CD and he obliged. Good stuff. Doesn't sound like us though. Where do you guys get that from? Well, better go check him out. You guys will dig it. We promise. P.S. limp has a copy too."
1,CD title said it all!!,"This CD is ""Hard To Swallow!!"" I'm a fan of metal music and I can take most anything, but this CD lost me somewere. Vanilla's rap was not selling so he went metal? He even does a remake of ""Ice Ice Baby"" which he calls ""Too Cold"" on this CD. Stick to rap or even doing top 40 jingles, but leave metal to the prose!! That ain't you Vanilla Ice, Ice baby:("
1,Remember when it was 1992?,"The trademark hair and image are gone, along with the sound, on Vanilla Ice's new album, hard to Swallow. And it is Hard to Swallow. This album, bears no original musical talent, and is a bad career move for Ice. The little amount of respect for Ice that we all shared has totally left, because he is such a sell out, just like MC Hammer, who makes gospel music now, after a turn at gansta rap.A message to all of the old-school artists out there: keep it real for your fans and for your image."
4,he has seen the light at the end of the tunnel,i just got done watching his documentary on MTV and had no idea he was still in music.he seems to have taken a turn for the better and is playing music that is true with no involvment from the media.I like the turn to hardcore type that he has done the LP does sound promising.AS far as being a Korn ripoff (not).he is not up to Korn;s level yet but the cd sounds pretty good.
1,Blatant and disgusting Korn Rip-Off...,"After hearing some tracks to this CD, I have to say don't buy this CD, buy Korn if you like this type of music. Korn did it first, and Korn does it best. Just a sad attempt at returning to the music business. When will he learn??? For white rappers, buy Beastie Boys or Eminem...they are not even in the same leauge as Vanilla Ice."
5,A nice surprise!!!!,"All the people that love Korn etc.. should get into this CD. People say that Vanilla can't rap. Well, I think Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan can't sing and yet they are praised everywhere for their contributions to music. If you don't have anything positive to say keep it to yourself. This CD isn't for everyone but if you dig the genre you WILL be impressed!!!!!"
1,Not worth a dime!!!!,Vanilla Ice has done it again on this one. He made another record to laugh at again. he comes a little more stronger tring to pretend he is hard core when it's just a sham. His beats are taken from Korns style which says a lot. I listened to this out of curiosity to see if it was better than his first. Turns out that this one tops his first CD in quality and beats. It's WORSE!!!!!!! Don't waste your money on this one!!!
5,excellent cd definitley worth listening to.,"For me, 1998 was the year of the iceman. I never owned Ice's previous work, and I never really cared for it either.I was in a streetside music store one night when I heard ""living"" being played I thought it was so much better than crybaby bands like korn. I asked the clerk who it was and he said it was vanilla ice. I was very surprised. I bought ""hard to swallow"" that night and I have loved listening to it ever since."
1,I scream! You scream! We all scream for Vanilla Ice cream!,"To all of you music lovers out there, Don't even think about ever buying this CD. Now that this CD is out-of-print now. I listened to the samples on here on Amazon, and I felt like I just wasted 30 minutes of my life listening to the samples. Vanilla Ice, your first CD To the Extreme was much better, but this piece of garbage does not deserve to exist in this world. This has got to be the worst CD ever made. This is not the kind of ice cream music that people would want to scream for. It is the most retarded CD on EARTH! I really loved your first CD to the Extreme, but Vanilla Ice, Please leave metal and rap music alone. Rap music is black people's music, not white people's music. Listening to the samples on this CD, My advice would be for you to stick to rap music since you did good on that first album. Better advice yet, just stop making music. Period."
5,you are wrong,"Hey it was not bodycount that sarted the rock/rap it was a group from the 80's called Anthrax that sarted it , and they were doin it it before you knew what good music is and before ice-T left the NWA. soo there and who care s about the bands popurilty. prefer bands that arent that popular like rob van winlke(vanilla ice) new stuff"
4,Vanilla Ice first rock/rap album,This CD is awesome! A must buy. Thou Bi-Polar is way better in the rock dept. Still a great CD TOO COLD!
2,Vanilla Ice need to RAP AGAIN,this is cd was horrible probably because it was rock and thats not what vanillas gifts and talents were for. he needs to get back into the rap game....
3,"Cool strap, but...","The design on the strap is cool, but does not cover the lenth of the strap. Only about half of the strap is wide. Also the fabric the patern is printed on on thin and sown onto a cheap ""pleather"" material. The strap may eventually make it onto my backup guitar, but for now it is just my emergency strap. If I had seen this in a store I would have bought a different strap."
5,The best cookbook ever!!,"This 1950 version of Betty Crocker's cookbook is the one my mom had. She was an excellent cook. I have hers, but my kids were fighting over who would get it. I have purchased them each one. It has pretty basic recipes but they are easy to follow and nothing too fancy or strange. Many tables and indexes for measurement which come in handy."
1,No support.,"This product is no different than any other cheaper (or even free) data recovery utility. The biggest drawback is absolutely zero customer support. Serial number not working after purchase? Too bad, AlphaOmega hides behind an email address that it doesn't even reply to. Save your cash and avoid all Alphaomega Soft Inc. products."
3,Did not work well.,"I could say this product really stinks if I didn't think my issues stemmed from just a bad virus. My computer was hit hard by a virus. I found it while using a Virus detection application and it damaged my files so bad that on reboot, it couldn't find my hard drive. I ran scandisk from a boot up disk and that proceeded to make matters worse. I then found out about this product and what I read made me believe it would work. It found many files but as it warns, found files are not always recoverable files. Try to avoid ever having to buy somethign like this; get a good virus protection software and back up your important files."
4,Love Generation - 'Love & Sunshine: Best Of.....' (Sundazed),"Vaguely even remember this act's name let alone their music. By name anyway, as I tend to recall a few of these sunshine pop songs. As I check out tunes like ""The Love In Me"", ""Not Be Found"", ""When The Sun Goes Down"" and ""Leaves You Grey"", I look into seeking more info about this bunch and think....WAIT a second, there! Several of this band's members were apparently the voices dubbed in for the Partridge Family's music during their four year TV series. I mean, this sort of sound was GREAT for it's time. Should appeal to fans of the Mamas&The Papas, Association, Freddie And The Dreamers, the Monkees, and the Cowsills. Recommended, if you dig this sort vintage memory."
1,Total garbage,"Usually, I'm a big fan of music from the 60's.... however this music is total crap. I am also a fan of ""sunshine pop"" (Cowsills, Partridge Family, Mamas & the Papas, etc.) but this is the most uninteresting, brainless tripe I have ever heard. This group is not even a competent knock-off. Session players at best. Beware of other reviewers who recommend this music if you are a fan of bubble-gum or sunshine pop. Not necessarily the case! This group deserves to be consigned to total oblivion...."
5,CONGRATULATIONS FROM BRAZIL,"(isaque.bressan@uol.com.br)I am very pleasure to send you a review about this great CD.First time when I heard these songs at CD store I felt very well, I felt the Spirit of The Lord on my life. So I bought. I fell very happy to listen this masterpiece.Congratulations Rev. Jackie McCullough. I know that Jesus Christ have taken care you every day, every time, in fact you are a special God's daughter, because you serve the King of the universe. Christians in the world, enjoy these songs. I recommend."
2,Barely worth Free,"I was interested in reading something that compares two of the world's great religions, but I was hoping for something a bit more intricate I guess. The reviewer who said this was old and outdated hit it right on the head"
1,ZERO Stars!,"This $10 pamphlet is an academic dissertation from 1904, holding no relevance for today. I would strongly suggest completely removing it from your inventory. It refers to Islam as ""Mohammedanism"". I was extremely disappointed and feel as though it was $ wasted I could have better invested in almost anything else."
1,a great film but the subtitles are cut off and unreadable!,"I wish someone else had mentioned this, but this is a horrible trasfer of a great film. The video picture quality is very poor and made from a very scratchy film print. on top of that you will most likely NOT be able to read the subtitles (unless you can read Cantonese)as they are cropped off the bottom of the screen. Different televisions have different overscan rates (they amount the crop off the edges of the picture you are watching). This problem may not be as bad on another t.v. set, but the amount they were cut off on mine was far greater then the standard differences in overscan across different t.v. manufacturers lines so I doubt you will have a different experience. This is usually NOT an adjustable feature. Wish I had better news to print."
2,Bad DVD of a great fun movie,"Too bad the folks who produced this didn't take some care with it. The picture is passable and the sound is OK but if you're interested in following the plot from reading the English subtitles be prepared for a lot of guessing and frustration as they are mostly unreadable at the bottom edge of the screen. I don't know how the subtitles are for the other languages, never tried them since I don't read them. But with no English language track the lack of useful English subtitles makes this DVD worthwhile only for the hard-core Chow Yun-Fat fan in America."
1,"Very, very bad version!","Leave your fingers of this version. A very good movie, Chow-Yun Fat at its best. But you will only understand, if you know to talk chinese! The english subtitles have been cut of!"
4,Bolshoi Lite,"I think the other reviews here are pretty much on the mark. It is a 5* production of a 3* ballet. Adding a bit to that, this is more fun than I expected. It is a complete story which holds interest, and there is something beyond pleasant, almost delightful about watching this. There is such depth in the sets, costumes, stagecraft and dancing that makes this a most pleasant evening of viewing. The performers seem to be having a good time, a showcase for revealing what the Bolshoi is all about. If the music had been of higher quality, and more fitting with the story and settings, this could have been among the top ballets in the classical repertoire. Although, saying great except for the music about a ballet, is damning with faint praise! It's hard giving an accurate review about something that is fundamentally flawed, yet at the same time delightful and worth seeing!"
4,"THE SONG ""THE CRYING GAME"" IS TRULY A HAUNTING TUNE!","I'M TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH THE SONG ""THE CRYING GAME""; I DON'T HAVE THE CD BUT I HAVE THE VIDEO OF THE MOVIE. I'VE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES; I WAS FASCINATED WITH THE MOVIE & I WATCH IT WHEN I GET IN A MELANCHOLY MOVIE. THE LEAD TUNE IS SO HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL. THANKS TO AMAZON.COM, I'M NOW GOING TO BUY THE CD."
3,"good intro to trance, but not much else","Ok, I wont lie, I love all the songs on this album. But to get down to it, most of the songs are pop trash by artists who really are more about putting out a massive summer club anthem. the best example would be the opener, ""heaven"". If you want to look into electronica, especialy trance, this would be a great startingg point as would the rest of the series, but if youve been around the scene for a while, i recomend getting one of Paul van Dyk's or Armin Van Burren's mix cds."
4,almost perfect....,"this is an amazing cd. the one problem with this cd is the length of the songs. i know all of these mixes of the songs, and mostly radio edits were used for this cd, which does not provide a long enough mix. also, the mix of ""4 o'clock in the morning"" by lazard is horrible. overall, i would recommend this album to the vocal trance fan that likes a fast-paced high energy trance mix. i would pick out my favorites from this album, but theyre too many too list."
1,Very Disapointed,I bought this to convert family VHS tapes to DVD format. The problem is that it limits the capture to a very small screen size (I am not a techie) that is roughly 1/4 of my 17 inch monitor screen. When I burned my first DVD and put it on my home system the picture was really rough - poor resolution. My main complaint is there is no mention of this on the box so I got burned for $70. It was a complete waste of money for my purposes!
1,"Waste of Money, and Time","Im not sure about the features and software as I could never get the product to work. The packaged software MovieStar crashed on start up everytime. I tried using other programs to capture, and no input was detected. When I tried to install the latest drivers for the product the installation froze each time. Average size AV cables (I tried two different sets)do not sit firmly in the device's inputs. The PC I am using is brand new and well above the minimum specifications and running XP. In case you havnt read it elsewhere, customer support is...well just don't bother, no toll free line, and outrageous wait time. E-mail responses are unhelpful at best.Overall just dont bother with this product. Two thumbs down...way down"
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,I installed this software as instructed and then connected USB cable. My new XP computer started to perpetually reboot every few minutes. Finally I realized I could stop this by disconnecting USB Cable. I checked website and found several references to the problem by frustrated buyers. These buyers had tried a patch download which did not fix problem. Same story with me. It appeared author was not doing anything to resolve. I finally tracked down a support phone number and received a recorded message that typical wait time was 40 minutes. The video tutorial looked great but while browsing website it looked as if this software was loaded with problems. After several hours of dealing with this mess I packed everything up and hope I can get a refund.
3,Too many problems setting up.,"I tried to install on a Windows ME system with USB 2.0. Analog video worked but I could not get S-Video connection to work which was the main reason I bought it. Also, the software or its installation process did something to Windows that it started requiring a password on boot-up. I uninstalled the software and used System Restore to go back to the settings before trying to install this gadget.If you buy it, make sure you set a restore point prior to starting installation."
1,Useful Paperweight,"I never could get this thing to work, mainly thanks to the poor trouble-shooting guide and the virtually non-existent customer support. To add insult to injury, uninstalling it removed MY video drivers and messed up my Microsoft Movie Maker (which now crashes when I try to use it).Key words : ""50-foot pole"" and ""don't touch""."
5,Respect your child's imagination,"Too often we underestimate a child's ability to appreciate quality. We fail to expose them to literature and art worth respecting and assume they can only enjoy the easy and the gawdy. Illustrator Loren Long is the father of two boys and he knows better. His illustrations are wonderful and he knows that children are capable of appreciating the honesty and humor of the little boy who leaves an astronomer's lecture to gaze in ""perfect silence at the stars."" To underscore the idea that children can participate in so-called adult matters, his sons offer a bit of their own artistic interpretation to this book. What better way to allow children the pleasure of appreciating quality than to introduce them to the illustrations of Loren Long and the poetry of Walt Whitman. This is a special book!"
3,Perfect example,"The other poster here is an example of what Walt Whitman talked of so long ago in his poem, about the loss of beauty stripped by blurred reason. His poem still carries with it the truth that was imbued into it when it was written back in his day, yet misunderstood by the Gordon's of today's world. It's a simple truth that cannot be realized by them, the difference between the pursuit of arts or sciences, the difference between the stroke of a brush and the straight line"
2,This Aint Sinatra,"I love Sinatra. I own all the albums. But this album won't do. With very few exceptions (Tony Bennet comes to mind), the people who are singing with Frank aren't fit to wipe Sinatra's boots. Bono isn't even good enough to park Sinatra's car. The only reason I give this album two stars is because I realise that it might have turned a few people onto Sinatra who hadn't previously listened to him."
5,THE AGELESS VOICE OF FRANK SINATRA,"JUST WHEN YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE 40'S, 50'S, 60'S OR EVEN 70'S WERE THE BEST YEARS OF FRANK SINATRA. HE SUPRISED US ALL BY COMING OUT WITH THIS GREAT CD IN THE 90'S (WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS). THE BEST SONGS THAT I LIKE ARE ""SUMMER WIND"", ""NEW YORK, NEW YORK"", ""GUESS I'LL HANG MY TEARS OUT TO DRY / IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING"", ""WITCHCRAFT"" AND ""I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN"". FRANK SINATRA'S VOICE (DESPITE BEING IN HIS LATE 70'S AT THE TIME) SHOWED NO APPRECIABLE LOSS OF THE GREAT SINATRA VOICE OF THE 1960'S. THE GRAND MASTER HIMSELF SINGING WITH THESE GREAT YOUNGER ARTISTS LIKE LUTHER VANDROSS, JULIO IGLESIAS, CARLY SIMON, ANITA BAKER AND BONO. I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO NEAT!"
1,Not what was promised,"This CD was advertised as being NEW. When received, the cover was all worn out, as it if it had been damaged by water, and the CD had been opened. It was not a brand NEW CD. The item's condition was misrepresented."
1,talk about driving a bulldozer over your career,"I am a long time FAS fan and own over 40 of his cd's. I wish this cd had never come out. Talk about driving a bulldozer over your career, Sinatra should have let this ""opportunity"" pass and let his fans enjoy other works from his discography."
2,Not Very Good At All,"I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this is a weak brew. Sinatra phones it in (literally - he wasn't even in the same room with his duet partners), and few of the guests offer anything of value. This is a marketing ploy, not an album - get any of the great Capitol releases from the 50s and learn why Sinatra was the Entertainer of the Century..."
3,Big Sinatra and his pals,"It is not the best of Sinatra, but quite remarkable that he could still sing close to his eighties. Some of the partners are legends by themselves, so it`s a chance to keep something that will become history as years go by"
3,Admirable,"This album features Frank and a number of ""modern"" hitmakers.Overall this is a fine album but some of the pairings just don't seem to work.eg.What Now My Love gets downright annoying!Hi-lites include Summer Wind,I've Got You Under My Skin and The Lady Is A Tramp.Surprisingly New York New York doesn't work as well as you think it would."
4,Duets and Duets II,"This album was a wonderful work of art, except for it would have been a masterpiece if all of the duets were actually duets not dub-ins. Sinatra's voice sounds a little rough and aged at times but it's still sinatra. I would have to say it opened doors to listeners of other music genres. A few of the artists tried to make the songs there own (cough, cough luther vandross?) Anyway i give this album 4 stars because after all it was a multi-platinum album. The orchestrations are wonderful but it lacks any vocal chemistry, still a good taste of sinatra in the September of his years."
5,The Hobo Philosopher,"Every time they started to count ""Old Blue Eyes"" out, he came back ... and he came back swinging.I couldn't believe this CD when I first heard it. Who were all these other great stylists?Bono (who the hell is Bono, I asked) How did I miss this guy? When I heard he was a ""rocker"" I said maybe I better start listening to more Rock.Then came Gloria Estefan. I had never heard of her either. Wow! really great.Now Charles Asnavour I had heard of. But what a great version of ""You Make Me Feel So Young.""Frank knew how to pick 'em ... his arrangers, his back-up bands and we found out on this CD ... other vocalists.This is another classic collector's item from the master. You can't miss with this selection. Old Frank knew what he was doing."
3,Not at his best but still Frank.,Interesting duets with different song stylists and sinatra holds his own. Would have been better with Frank in his prime. All in all worth listening to.
5,Lorrie NZ,No matter what Frank Sinatra sings I will always love his music. Having duets with various reknowned singers was a great idea as it brought in another dimension to Frankie's repertoire. Thankyou FS for a CD that is a pleasure to listen to.
2,Just an ember by this time,"Difficult to recommend this novelty CD. Frank is a mere shadow of his former self, and most of the pairings were less than satisfying, although I did enjoy Vandross, Streisand, and Bennett. Only buy this one if you have his earlier recordings, and you're a die hard fan wanting everything Frank."
2,What A Fraud,"My rating is based on the fact that the music is decent at best, consist of a strange mixture of artists, and I feel cheated that none of the artists were in the studio with The Chairman. One reviewer wrote, ""The way Bono sings this one with Frank brings new life to this classic."" Well, it's simply not true that they were ""with"" each other. I know of no other duets recording where the star lays down the tracks and the guest artists come along and sing to the tapes afterwards. In addition, Frank's voice simply in not up to par with his earlier recordings. I'm 35 and I love Frank Sinatra but I have to objectively say that this is one to pass on."
2,Don't waste your money on this one.,"A lame attempt to exploit "" the Voice"". There are great artists on this CD, but it just doesn't cut it. Bob Dylan and Frank Sinatra, I don't think so."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"As a beginner to aromatherapy I found that this book was an excellent starter book that doesn't over simplify techniques, but is still easy to use and enables you to understand and apply the methods. The book is layed out very well. Each oil is described thoroughly by origin, family, extraction, medicinal action, cosmetic/skin use, and emotional attributes. The reader will learn the many different uses of aromatherapy. The book also reviews safe use of aromatherapy. I highly recommend this well written book for anyone starting to use aromatherapy."
3,Good info and recipes - don't like how book is organized,"I am just beginning to play with aromatherapy and while this book has a lot of useful tips and recipes, I don't like the way the chapters are set and always have to refer to the index to find what I'm looking for. For example, nausea is in the Women's Health section that seems to relate to morning sickness. Nausea is not solely a woman's problem."
4,i like the book,i found the book to be easy to follow and a good review book on oils for peole who are starters of learning about essential oils
5,I love the book,"I love the book, how ever it did not come in time so I had to order the kindle version. so it was a costly book for me."
5,Easy to use,"This book is a chapter book which made it easy to read from the history of aromatherapy to step to step making aromatic recipe. As a beginner of aromatherapy, this book is really easy to use as it provide explanation, description, and formulas. Recommend to all starter of aromatherapy."
3,"Good information, but a little dated.","I recently developed an interest in woodworking and purchased this book as a reference and to learn more about using routers. The information presented is all accurate and laid out well, but somewhat dated - the copyright date is 1990. Some of the router types and features that are available today are not covered in the book. If I had to do it again, I would purchase Taunton's 'Complete Illustrated Guide to Routers' instead."
4,Cute as a button,This set is very bright and cheery. It will be great whether I have a boy or a girl. It is definately on my shopping list!
5,most excellent,"as usual, love every episode. am so glad I will be able to watch them anytime i want to."
2,"Murdwer,She Wrote- The Fifth serson",Several of the disk keep stopping on some dead spots and don't want to play. Will I buy from this supplier agaun I don't think so.
3,I wanted more from Cabot Cove,"It seems that most were in different locations, without the great supporting characters I enjoyed for the local Cabot Cove shows."
5,"Murder, She Wrote - The Complete Fifth Season","I'm very well satisfied with this set. I enjoy watching Angela Landsbury work, the clothes she wears and the actors and actresses that haven't been seen in a long time. I've also ordered Season 6."
4,"It was a good book, but slightly over-detailed.","I found this a very good book. Hugh Maclennan described each character very well to the point where i felt that i was part of the characters' lives. It was enjoyable to read what Montreal was like then and compare it to Montreal today, and read about the same streets that i walk on almost every day (I live in Montreal). In all, a good book."
4,"Superb, evocative modern jazz","Until recently, Steve Lacy was one of these undiscovered jazz-treasures (for me, that is!). I'd heard of him of course, but I'd never listened to his music. Morning Joy is my Lacy debut and, boy, what an introduction! Glorious music, be it the Monk interpretations or the other selections on the album. This is the type of album that gives jazz a good name. Fantastically talented musicians, yes!, but not only in terms of their individual achievements, the group interaction is absolutely spot-on also (since I've bought this album it has hardly been out the CD player).In short, Morning Joy will be the first of a large number of Lacy CDs that will find its way to my collection. Please note that the only reason why I did not rate this music with 5 stars, is because I can't compare with other Lacy material. If this would be his only one, I would have definitely rated it with 5 however."
4,Excellent CD but not his best,"Very seldom do you begin a review with, ""This is a great CD, but certainly not his best work,"" but that's just what I'm doing. ""See Through Me"" is an awesome CD, but if you are new to Randall Bramblett's great work, I suggest you start with ""No More Mr. Lucky"" followed by ""Thin Places."" The good news? If you start with this CD you are STILL going to like it a lot!""See Through Me"" dislays strong songwriting skills (no surprise to Bramblett fans) and the music is great. The only difference between this and Bramblett's two most recent CDs is that ""See Through Me"" is a liitle uneven compared to those two.If you have already purchased ""No More Mr. Lucky"" and ""Thin Places"" then by all means buy this CD! It's excellent and still beter than 99.5% of what's out there, it's just not quite up to those previously mentioned works. I still give this FOUR STRONG STARS, but this is not the CD to begin an exploration of Randall Bramblett."
4,interesting twist,"i find this book quite entertainng because of the very original stories. A thousand deaths is my favorite. It shows how a man overcomes the fear of death, yet it ends with a strange twist to it.this book is ver y good and i recommend i"
5,Are you crazy? No way to describe the book in one line.,"Lets put it this way, I bought the book the first edition it came out. Till now, I still reread it. I read Waylander before it and I couldn't believe how good that was until I got knocked off by King Beyond the Gate. I hate to compare the book to books from other authors, but seriously, the book shines even in the presence of the 200 fantasy books in my collection."
4,Heroic Fantasy,"Good if you like that sort of thing. This is fantasy, not science fiction (some of these tags are misleading). There is something in these novels referred to as the Source, which is also revered as a god, and it's used like the Force but without its telekinetic qualities. These are fun stories that espouse sacrifice and death before dishonor. There's no ""live to fight another day"" in Gemmel's world. The Source is their magic (astral projection, mind-reading, remote viewing, psychic communication, etc). Anyway, I enjoyed it. Some epic fantasy battles require a huge investment of time. Fortunately, these read fast."
3,Once again a Gemmel book with amazing odds,"As my title says once again this is a gemmel book in which one main hero, a couple of companions and a horribly outnumbered army somehow manage to defeat the enemy and save the world again.Don't get me wrong though, this book is a great book with a gripping storyline, lifelike characters and of course the usual gemmell violence.This book is good for a light read because it is not to complicated and follows a fairly standard plot line with no major twists at the end.Not gemmells best but still a great book."
4,Better than Legand,"I love the way that this book follows on from ""Legend"". It relates to civil war, and sets things up nicely for the sequel (Quest for lost heros). The leading three characters are fantastic. The badies bring real intrest to the story also. The Dark templar are wicked, but I think the werebeasts known as the Joinings are an absulote master stroke!! The end battle delivers more excitment than that of Legend, espicially the final stand against the Joinings.After this, read Quest for Lost Heros strait after."
5,utterly amazing,"this book is impossible to put down. Tenaka Khan is a hero worth reading and the charecters in this book will make you laugh,cry, and belive in heros"
4,The coming of the true uniter,"I dont have to much to say because over all it was just a good book, but here it goes.Tenaka...awesomeDecado...even betterAnanais...sweetPagan...he was greatFor the people who say that you should only read this if u liked legend, I totally disagree. I actually read this book before Legend and liked it a whole lot better. The battle sequences where fast paced and action packed. Like always Gemmel packs a good story in a short book."
1,It was the worst book I've ever read,"This book began all right, but degraded into meaningless jumble of offensive sex and devil worship. I was looking for a good book, and the cover compared it to Interview With the Vampire, by Anne Rice. Interview being one of my favorite books, I started this one with high hopes. It was terrible!! The plot is this: David Bathory, heir to the family control of vampires. From there, it trailed off into describing (in extremely offensive detail) the sex he has with his uncle and his sister. I didn't care to finish the book.The author should be sued for false advertising, comparing his book to one of today's top writers. I gave this book one star, but only because I couldn't give it less. To anyone not interested in literary pornography, don't even bother picking up this book. Read Anne Rice if you are looking for well-written vampires."
5,Law & Order: SVU Third Season,This was bought as a gift for my 22 year old. It was her birthday and she requested this. I was happy to find this on Amazon. My daughter is very happy with the DVD's.
3,Some improvements for Season 3,"I love this show. My review is not about the show, however. It is about the DVD itself.1. The box art is identical to season 2 with Benson & Stabler reversed. Was it that hard to find other pictures of the cast?2. FINALLY, no more double sided discs! Thank God! This set is 5 single sided discs packaged in 3 slim-cases. A huge improvement.3. Still no widescreen aspect ratio and 2.0 sound. That's disappointing. If this was in 5.1 surround sound and anamorphic widescreen, the set would be much better. Those with Widescreen HDTV's and Home Theatres know what I'm talking about.All in all, however, the show itself is great, so it's worth picking up if you're and L&O; fan. I just wish Universal would make a more quality DVD package. Look at CSI, Lost, The Office, etc. DVD seasons. They are much better!"
5,i love Law and Order SVU,"this is such a great season!!!! i have 1,2,5 and now season 3 is out. I love Benson but i would high suggest to purchase this season!! I can't wait until 4,6,7,8 its going to be GREAT!!!!!!!!!"
1,Don't even bother to try this!,"The 6-in-1 Reader did not work. The video program kept crashing. But the worst part is the essentially non-existent support from Pinnacle Systems. Couldn't find an answer on their troubleshooting website; after 2 weeks of sending e-mails in a futile effort to get some help, I bundled it up and sent it back!"
1,Dazzle Fusion Doesn't Work.,"Two days. Nothing. It kept telling me that me memory stick wasn't formatted. This, after I've taken over 1000 pictures and movies using it.Don't waste your time or money. Learn from my mistakes.I'd give it 0 stars if that was an option."
4,Great vast amount of knowledge,This book contains the most comprehensive amout of Architectural infomation I have ever seen. I had to purchase this book for class and I would recommend it if you can find it... Not only can it help with studies a must own for regular knowledge.
4,Overlooked and underrated,"I became a fan of this great Finnish band once I heard their 1989 albumIndian Warrior. Their sound is hard to pin down exactly, but there are elements of Bad Company, the Cult, Whitesnake, and Mr. Big. Essentially what you're getting with Havana Black is first class blues-based hard rock.1991's Exiles in Mainstream is the band's third album, and while it may not be the powerhouse that Indian Warrior was, it is still a very good rock album. This is not some ""by-the-numbers"" Hollywood hair band trying to glom onto other bands' popularity. Even if the music is your basic bluesy rock & roll, you can tell that Havana Black pours plenty of heart and soul into their music.Despite the band's obvious talents, they never reached a wide audience. They released one more album and called it a day. Sigh, it's always the best bands that disappear too soon."
5,Voice of the Xtabay Yma sumac,Outstanding CD will continue to buy from your company. Fast service and great shipping.
4,if you like exotica............,"Yma Sumac had an unbelievable range as a singer. Although this is not my favorite Yma Sumac album , it still is great, the arrangements are by the one and only Les Baxter, who is on of my all-time favorites. This album was very unusual for the time it was released, not the most ""commerical"" of albums."
4,AMAZING VOCAL GYMNASTICS,"The range of this singer's voice is truly incredible - one moment she sounds like a twittering nightingale as her voice quivers along the highest of the high notes, the next it's down to the ground in a rumbling thunderstorm or shuddering earthquake. There's nothing quite like it. Some info on Yma can be found in the Re/Search publication Incredibly Strange Music by V Vale & Andrea Juno, available here on amazon.com. I recommend this album to all who are interested in the exotic, like world music or the equally strange sounds of Meredith Monk."
2,not anything like it looks,"this looks nothing like the picture it shows. i got it to us it in a movie but i couldnt. if u need it for a decoration, then it is a good price but overall not a good item."
1,Not Fooling Anyone!,"This literally looks like a sponge painted black with a few white paint specks on it. It looks nothing like a rock and when you squeeze it you can see the paint start to crack. If you want something more realistic, go for something more pricey."
4,rock,"pretty good, doesn't look as real as i thought it was going to but still fools people. thanks for the fast shipping"
3,Nothing big about this CD,"The high screaming, guitar blazing debut from Janus Stark combines punk, heavy metal, and even a little pop into one. The CD has an original sound to it, but the tracks just don't stand out too well. The first single, ""Every Little Thing Counts"" is a very catchy tune indeed, and the most radio friendly tune on the CD, too. There's still some other good songs, the long anthem ""Dynamo"" turns from soft, and melodic to loud, and screeching within seconds. This may be somewhat annoying at times, but the track works well. The heavy metal/pop tunes ""Clique"" and ""New Slant on Nothing"" are pretty good, too, and the final track ""Barriers"" has a sound similar to ""Every Little Thing Counts"" The rest of the CD is pretty bad, especially on ""White Man Speak With Fork Tongue."" Overall, there's nothing big about this CD."
4,Old Fashioned Bargain,"I wanted to make some Deli-Style rye bread, which called for fresh caraway seeds both inside and on top of the loaf. On a per-ounce basis these were much less costly than big-name spice company seeds. They were delicious. I used one-third and froze the rest. People raved about the bread."
2,Frontier Caraway seed,Won't continue to take but had to try it. Wasn't what I had expected. So gave it to my daughter for she likes all that kind of stuff
1,Caraway Seeds,I am sure this product may help with bloating as Dr. Oz suggested. But the seeds are awful to eat and I don't plan to buy anymore.
1,Do not buy this junk,"I bought a 6420 and experienced multiple problems with the motherboard. I had to send it in for service 3 separate times before it was replaced. Immediately the unit would power up dead 25% of the time. They kept trying to just re-brain the hard drive with a new image and saying they could not replicate it. I would go without the computer for 2 weeks at a time for them to do this. Finally they fixed it by replacing the motherboard and all was well until after the warranty ran out. The replacement motherboard failed completely (the prior problem caused it to fail to boot with the fan running at full speed only sometimes). Now it won't boot at all.These PCs are really junk. My parents have an Emachine too. I was fond of it, but it failed too after 1 year of use. The motherboard died as well. I don't think I'll buy another one from them. They are cheap, but replacing a PC because it dies every year is not cheap.Buyer beware."
4,Another good book,"After a recent trip to Ireland, this was a good way to follow up on the famine period in Ireland. The book was in good condition and was well written."
3,Good songs - presentation not so great,"Since seeing the video of ""I get excited"" back in the 80's I have always wanted to have a dvd of Rick. I was a bit disappointed to watch a song in concert and suddenly find myself listening to an interview with Rick before the song continues. This breaks the flow of the concert. Surely they could have kept all interviews as added ""special features"". The music includes many of Rick's greatest songs!"
4,Live in Rockford review,"It was good to finally see a modern, full length Rick concert released. My only gripe is that the sound could have been a bit fuller. Anyone familiar with his ""Greatest Hits Alive"" CD might have become accustomed to a heavier sound for his live performances. Besides that, it was a great concert and recording. I was especially impressed with the songs performed from SDAA and TDAY, which were performed with that little bit more confidence than some of the older material. That said, the acoustic guitar version of ""My father's chair"" (included as an extra track?) was brilliant. Fans new and old won't be disappointed with this purchase. It would be good to see vintage tracks like ""Speak to the sky"" and ""Comic book heroes"" performed in concert though, just for old times sake."
4,Good Concert,"I'm a big Rick Springfield fan, so I was very excited about this DVD. The concert was good, the photography was a little disappointing. Not enough close ups, and a little jumpy. That's why I gave ity 4 instead of 5 stars. My complaint with all concert recordings is too much audience time, I could care less about them! But that's just me..."
1,4 Missing Episodes,"I also purchased this series and found 4 of the 12 episodes missing completely from the discs. They were episodes 4,5,9,10. Pretty hard to follow the story line when 1/3 of the series is missing. I returned the set for a refund and have no plans to re-order it as I fear a repeat performance of the missing discs. I'm happy to see that Amazon has discontinued selling it at this time."
1,Great -- except for missing episodes.,"Quite enjoyed it up to the entirely missing Episodes 9 and 10. No subtitles, commentary, fine, no problem. But that just ruined it for me. Lionsgate should at least post them online."
2,not very compelling,"I have watched both versions of the Borgia's and have to say Showtimes's is far superior. Jeremy Irons seethes evil as Rodrigo Borgia, whereas John Doman seems to be sleepwalking through the role. There is a lot of uneveness of character in the CANAL+ version, and you are never vested in the characterizations.. I hoped this one would have been better, but, alas..."
2,not good.,"1. The narrator's introduction for every episode starts with Bo-D-gia, not Borgia.2. Spanish accent mother and over-pronounced American accent daughter performance looks/sounds awkward .3. unorganized story telling to the bothering level."
3,No Subtitles!!,"My Wife is currently enjoying the series. I can watch it but being 50 percent deaf I can't understand it. There are no subtitles!!! With the problem with not being able to choose episodes 4 & 5 on disc one, and episodes 9 & 10 on disc two; you can select these episodes. On the menu, select Episode Selection. When the 1st three episodes appear, go down to main menu and you will see an arrow pointing right. Move the cursor under the right arrow (not under Main Menu) and press Enter. Ta Da!! There are the other two episodes."
2,@ copies bought both FAULTY,I bought 2 copies of Borgia Faith & Fear Season One and had to return both copies as 5 Episodes were missing from the 12 Episode Season One. I was extremely disappointed.
3,The fire still burns ....,"I love Bob Seger. Always have. Always will. The most powerful song on here is The Fire Inside. And there's a handful of other good cuts on here. Breaks my heart that Bob's voice is starting to age and sounds a little strained. The lyrics on these songs are very introspective and just a little sad. If you are a true Seger fan, I'd say fork over the cash for this one; if you only appreciated Bob in his prime, I think the only tune on here you'll like is the title track. But Bob, you are still The Big Dog. WOOF."
4,The Fire Inside the power of Seger's music,"The long gap continues. In 1991,five years after LIKE A ROCK,THE FIRE INSIDE was released. This album might have been available on LP in limited quantities and limited areas. THE REAL LOVE has a beautiful sound. TAKE A CHANCE has a powerful drive. Bruce Hornsby plays the accordion on SIGHTSEEING. ALWAYS IN MY HEART is another Seger-penned love ballad. The title track appeared on '94's GREATEST HITS. REAL AT THE TIME sounds cool. NEW COAT OF PAINT is a lounge song(nice,smooth jazz). Other powerful rockers include WHICH WAY and THE MOUNTAIN. This album's ""calm"" song is THE LONG WAY HOME. There's also the country-flavored BLIND LOVE and another powerful rocker,SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. In addition to Hornsby,guest artists include Bonnie Raitt and Patty Smyth."
3,two unforgettable songs,"i loved two songs in a magmatic bunch, i mean ""fire inside"" and ""Always in My Heart"" . All the rest is air in the wind."
5,Great Reissue Of Bob Seger's Most Underrated Album,"This is a great remastered reissue of Bob Seger's most underrated album, THE FIRE INSIDE. The album ranges from the Ted Nugent-Outlaws-Springsteen hybrids of ""Take A Chance"" and ""It Was Real At The Time"" to the 50s-style piano rocker title track to the romantic ballad ""The Real Love."" This was the first album where Seger seemed to show any sense of comfort with where he was, even if he was still keeping an eye on the dangerous elements of society which he feared could harm himself or others he cared about. Seger's strong nationalistic support for efforts to free Americans jailed in Iran and North Korea on trumped-up charges during the early part of 2009 makes this CD-R an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
4,"Right notes, wrong fingerings","If you are buying this for the guitar solos then you should know that the notes are accurate, but the positions and fingerings are off. Here is a great example: Marty Friedman doesn't sweep down the strings (i.e. B string to A string). Before you take a stab at the solos, listen to the solos measure by measure to hear the timbre of the strings, the inflections of the notes, and what techniques he might be using. Transcribe each line to a position that closest fits what you hear and what is most efficiently played."
1,impossible to use,"I bought this item at Walmart without taking a closer look at it because it said 'Revlon' on it. This does not work at all. The product is well-made and all, but the metal ""V"" part is not actually a V.The bottom part that should be what's trimming the cuticles, is so flat that it just pushes against the cuticle area. No matter how hard you press/push with the trimmer, the flat bottom of the V just applies pressure to your finger; I seriously think it works just as well as a butterknife would for the same purpose.I gave up after about an hour of struggling with it trying to tell myself that I'm not using the trimmer correctly (when in fact I used to have another cuticle trimmer that actually worked), and making the cuticles on my left hand extremely sore.I do not recommend this product."
2,sculptor,thought these would work better than the junky stuff they carry at Walmart now. The work only slightly better. Too bad I bought 6.
1,"No OHV, bad maps, little useful info","Lots of preachy leave no trace -- or tampon -- behind advice. Little useful information.WRNF is one of the major OHV areas in Colorado, with trail routes designated and marked by the Forest Service. The cover of this book says 'Forest Service Trail Info.', and has a picture of a motorcycle, so I bought it as a guide to OHV trails. As far as I can tell there is NO INFO ABOUT OHV use. Sheesh.The maps aren't so much maps as diagrams. If you go, you'll need to buy a real map.Every description is pretty much the same: Hike from the start to the end, see the mountain on the left and the one on the right. Fish in the lake. Leave no trace behind....Other than that, it's fine."

4,very pleasant music,"probably the most homogenic LP from Marx. He does it well on the ballads and on the ""tough"" tracks. I like to hear this one from the start to the end."
5,"A Big, Big Sound!","From the opening lines (""Nothing You Can Do About It"") of this album, Richard Marx practically challenges us just to try and NOT listen to this music! And, as any listener of contemporary music in the last 10 years knows, we all lost that challenge! Continuing from the spectacular success of his self-titled first album, and last single (the #1 Hold On To The Nights) ""Repeat Offender"" picks up right where Marx left off. The first single ""Satisfied"" rocked and rocketed to the top of the charts in just a few weeks. The follow-up single ""Right Here Waiting"" gave Marx a three-peat at the top, and has become one of the legendary love songs of all time. Following that success, ""Angelia"" (#3), ""Too Late To Say Goodbye"" (#7), and the uplifting benefit song ""Children Of The Night"" (#13), all proved that we just could not, and would not ignore this album."
4,great cd,"This a great CD with Richard's best song ever! I bought this CD for Right Here Waiting, and I was supprised on how good the other songs were and it's a must have for anyone."
1,"poorly written, not very helpful","this book was a total disappointment. on such an important topic, I expected something a lot better."
1,Not Edan the rapper!!!!,"I bought this... there was no info, no picture, and I found one used for pretty cheap. I was excited to get Edan's first album, I love Prim+ and B&tB so i was like ""a '92 release??"" NOPE! This some late 80's style hair metal-type band. If you are looking for the rapper do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this.... I have yet to listen to it, so I don't know if it's good for it's actual genre."
4,must be missing an angel..,"infectious rhythm'n'noise bombardment courtesy of Adrian Sherwood with Stewart's lovely vocals floating on top. also includes two bonus tracks from the ""Hypnotised"" 12 inch."
4,an excerp from the book,"""Many years ago, two groups of scientists educated in entirely different theoretical psychiatric orientations came independently to identical conclusions. One group, the analysts, including Sigmund Freud, and a second group, the behaviorists, both concluded that the fantasies coming from early childhood sexual experiences were critical to the child's development of adult sexual interest. It is a rare scientific occurrence for two groups of scientists from two different perspectives to come to identical conclusions. When this does occur, we say that the finding is of increased scientific validity. Our finding, that the older child's repeated sexual fantasies of much younger children shapes that child's adult sexual interest in children, is yet another confirmation of these earlier theories.""It seems to me that they have something here."
2,Flimsy material,"This is a thin stamped and painted vanity plate, I would not have purchased it if I had been able to look at it first. The picture of the item makes it look much better than it is."
2,Cheap. Got what I paid for,"This plate is extremely flimsy and never looked right. It's super thin. I didn't pay much, so I'm not too upset, but if your looking for quality don't buy this one"
5,Nissan Logo Plate At The Best Value,"Its true that this plate doesn't have a 3D logo. But, I sware, from a distance of 10 or more feet, the logo does look 3D. And, I don't know about you, but the people I drive past on the highway are usually at least 10 feet away. For the price of this plate compare to other Nissan logo plates, I am more than happy with it. It looks great on my new Nissan."
5,Best brown sugar I've ever used!,I have been using this dark brown sugar for a couple years. I just started selling my organic baked goods at the local farmers market and I use this along with the light brown sugar (also from Wholesome Sweeteners) in my cinnamon rolls. They are fantastic! I think the trick is using THIS brown sugar. It's much darker than the dark brown sugar you buy in the stores. It's so worth the money!
4,tasty but the ziplock is useless,"The brown sugar is very moist and tasty. I put it in my tea, and I just made sweet rice with it. The only thing is the ziplock is useless. It's manufactured wrong (doesn't line up!). I had to move the sugar to a glass jar."
4,Elegant,"The thermometer is small, yet elegant. But I now regret that I should have bought the ones with more 'dials'. And I believe it works much better than the stupid thermometer on my wall."
3,ok,"Not a big fan of scary movies, but I didn't mind watching this movie. The story is cool, it makes sense. The effects may not be the best, but they are good enough to get you scare. It is not a bad movie.*Sponsored Post"
3,Remember it was written in l941!!!,"I ordered this book because of a list on the Web. It listed books selected as worthwhile reading. It was and I am glad I stuck to it BUT it was slow and boring in some spots. There were periods that I found myself during chores during my appointed reading times. I did feel strong emotions come through in the main characters but many times, I wanted to shake both of them or light a fire under them. Writing ""back in the day"" was much, much different from todays action from page one. Much more introduction and a heap more of words. Very stiff and v.ery formal. A hard read"
5,Canadian Literature at its' best!,"Through the journal entries of Mrs. Bentley, we are given a beautiful and complex novel of great importance in Canadian Literature. As a story of life during the depression, this book perfectly captures the trials of prairie life during this era. As Mrs. Bentley describes events in her journal entries, we are given a chance to not only accept the text at face value, but to read between the lines. Mrs. Bentley tends to say more by what she doesn't write than what she does. All in all, an incredible book and one which everyone should read."
1,"Thalia is Wonderfull, but this album...","I love Thalia and all of her albums, but now is time to her release a new album, not more the best songs... this album don't have lyrics or photos, and the songs are the same of Mis Mejores Momentos, Grandes Exitos, 20 Kilates Musicales..."
3,Just okay,I had hoped for more Yoga exercises. Colleen Saidman is always really good at describing yoga positions; but this dvd needed more exercises....The medical information was okay...but all in all the entire DVD should have had more substance.
4,The Psychology of Lpve,An elucidating summing-up of different current subjects in the psychology of love.
2,Boxes need more padding,"I received 24 of these and a few were broken. The next batch sent out also contained 2 that were broken. There was insufficient padding in the original Anchor Hocking box and Amazon repacks in a bigger box with bubble wrap on only a couple sides. The top and bottom needed the extra padding. Request padding on all sides of the Anchor Hocking box if you are ordering these. Once I got 24 unbroken glasses, they worked well at my daughter's baby shower which was only 3 days after I received them. Amazon overnighted the new batch to me and everything was fine."
3,The best feature of these tweezers is the ...,"The best feature of these tweezers is the grip. They hold firmly, and once the hair is gripped, it can be pulled out without slipping. The shape of the tweezers is great, too -- very easy to hold on to. However, I'm disappointed by the lack of precision. The tip of the tweezers is thick and feels clumsy. In spite of the name """"micro-fine"""", I can't use these tweezers for plucking just one eyebrow hair. A few years ago I had other Revlon tweezers with a fine, slant tip, which were very precise. I hope that model is still on the market so I can replace this one!"
3,Mine wasn't very good,"I have 2 of these, one is very sharp and breaks off the hairs sometimes, and the other is sort of sharp, but really gets those pesky hairs! I got this one, a third, and it was so slippery and didn't grab the hairs at all. I think this tweezer is usually the best, but this time around, it just wasn't. Into the trash it went :-("
2,Not too impressed,"I always do my own eyebrows at home, have been for 10 years and get a lot of compliments so I am pretty confident with my abilities, but these tweezers were not what I was expecting. I had seen reviews that said Revlon slant tip were a good buy, but they dont grab the hair right. I don't think the edges properly line up. So you are left trying to pull the same single hair out 10 times. Not worth a dollar, these went in the garbage after the second try. I'll stick with tweezerman."
1,Useless,"I tried SO hard to give these tweezers a chance, but they are absolutely horrible. They are sharp, so you will likely accidentally catch your skin and it will leave a red mark or puncture it (and hurt). The tweezers cut or slide off of thicker eyebrow hairs, and are par, at best, at plucking thinner hair. They are lightweight, unlike my other Revlon tweezers, which were substantially heavier and better. I imagine my old ones are discontinued, so I tried this one. What a waste and can't even return it."
3,Not bad but there is better,"This used to be my favorite tweezer until I found Revlon Platinum Tweezer, Slant Tip. Now it is just ordinary. The tip is great and it holds well and all, but the Platinum has such a finer tip and I have uploaded just how micro fine it is in my images here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/AXQNEMI9N0Z2D/ref=cm_aya_bb_listsWhile I haven't uploaded a picture of the Revlon Expert Tweezer here, it is similar to the Tweezerman tip in width. The Platinum really is much finer and easier to use.I hope this helps."
5,Not black but the tweezers are good,"I bought two, one for me and one to send to my husband who is deployed. They came in this blue flower design, my husband said they are embarassing to use, I like them better than the black. He made me buy a new pair in a normal color. The product works great though, I rate it up there with tweezerman which are much more expensive, they don't have the edge that tweezerman does but thats helpful for me because i don't accidently pinch my skin or break off hairs instead of plucking them. So I love mine, him not so much."
2,tips were supose to be even but there not,The tips were supose to be even but there not. I've bought these before and they were fine I guess I was just unlucky. In proper condition I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars but since these were messed up I'm giving them 2.
3,What the heck color?,"I'm thinking I was going to get a solid black tweezer set and instead get a amoeba designed pair that's blue and white. What is that?! Oh manliness, now they are not allowed to be left out."
1,Received a substitute tweezers not as shown,"Received a substitute tweezers not as shown.The tweezers that I received had a flower pattern on them, not black as shown."
5,This product is fantastic! It was great for ...,"This product is fantastic! It was great for those hard to spot chin hairs that occur after a certain age. The slant tip really helps; it can get out the tiniest things. The handle is made so your fingers won't slip off like the other brands do. At least I had that problem. I have recommended it to friends and give this product an A++ rating. If you need a tweezers, then this one's for you!"
4,These tweezers worked excellently. I used them immediately ...,"These tweezers worked excellently. I used them immediately on my eyebrows. I think they work better than the other tweezers I've used because they seem easier to handle. I would recommend these tweezers to people who have bushier eyebrows, because they seem to remove the hair faster than the other ones I've used. I would definitely buy this in the future."
5,love them,"very nice tweezers, perfect for plucking my eyebrows with ease. They grasp the hairs with little to no effort. Love them."
5,These tweezers are wonderful! I was able to ...,"These tweezers are wonderful! I was able to grab the tiniest hairs with them and pluck them comfortably, without any pain at all. I would definitely recommend these to my friends and family and I plan on purchasing an extra pair for myself."
4,I was generally quite pleased with the Revlon ...,"I was generally quite pleased with the Revlon Professional Micro-Fine Tweezer, Slant Tip. As a personal tool, I appreciated both its sleekly-designed form and the effective, utilitarian way that it functioned."
4,great Tweezers,Great coach we have ever tried is so funny last very long time and he gets a Maharg that you own reachable this is a really big help for me to do
2,Too Slow Paced,"I bought several of Vicki Regon's tapes. She seems to be a very fun teacher and very good dancer. But the instructions are too slow-paced. There are a lot of repeats which are not necessary for DVDs and video tapes. With only 4 or 5 steps taught in each tape, if you are a beginner, I doubt ""you can dance"" comfortbly on the floor after you've learned from those tapes. In terms of steps per dollar, you can find much better deals on market than this series."
4,It's a must for starters,Easy to learn the first steps and to follow the instructions.The producers should make other dvd-s for more advanced steps.
4,Good starter DVD,There was one mistake when Ron counts the waltz as quick-quick-slow (it is always an even 1-2-3). They should have caught and edited that out. Otherwise a good starter dance video.
2,not teaching enough,"They do not teach much in this DVD. Just the box, balance and one underarm turn. It's a true waste of my money"
4,Allen Company Flotation,"Este producto es bastante bueno, el material es de calidad por el precio que se paga, ademas la escopeta cabe perfectamente."
4,Good Product!,"Although I was surprised when it arrived and was labeled ""Jensen"" rather than ""Energizer"", the quality of the battery appears consistent with the Energizer brand. A huge improvement over the previously-purchased batteries that all arrived DOA, or close to it, from a different vendor. Would definitely reorder these in the future."
1,Do not last,"Purchased several of these for ATT handsets. At first they work fine, but when the phones are heavily used, after a few months they will not hold a charge. Instead of the original 30 to 60 minute talk time, they now provide 5 minutes. The original batteries lasted more than three years before suffering similar maladies. These are actually made by Audiovox and only carry the ""Energizer"" label. Warranty replacement entails a significant ""handling charge"". Save yourself some grief, do not buy these batteries, I'm ordering Panasonic replacements. One star only because negative stars are not an option."
4,Fixed our problem,"Our four AT&T cordless phones were exhibiting two problems: distortion and dropouts, and short battery life. These batteries fixed both problems."
3,Too Costly!,"The only reason I kept the covers is because they match with my leopard theme. When I filled them up, the edges were floppy. The price was too high for the product."
4,pretty good,"I never gave A Tribe Called Quest a listen, despite Amazon recommending it like 'you copped this, give this a try' kinda y'know whatta mean, I did not pay it much attention. Well this is the first Tribe Quest album I heard and it's really good. 'The Love Movement' album is feel-good music with simple beats and instrumentals but very good with wicked focus on the rhymes. Its got Mos Def on it, that's a plus too. This 'limited edition' gives a taste of tracks other albums like 'Jazz (We've Got'. Great CD for those new to A Tribe Called Quest. Great album."
4,Good things come to those who listen...,"People often make the mistake of trying to rank A Tribe Called Quest's albums. You can do that with Master P, you can do that with Tupac, but Tribe's music is on a different level. Each piece is a unique work of art that can't be compared to past, or future albums. The Love Movement is no exception. Tribe has gone from the earthy, playful tracks of Instinctive Travels to a hard-core, in-your-face style on Beats, Rhymes, and Life. Now with the Love Movement, Tribe leaves us with a taste of everything they have done so far. You want upbeat tribal beats? You get Da Booty and Find a Way. You want a hard edge with a modern flavor? You get Phife's solo, Mutty Ranks or Steppin it Up with Busta Rhymes and Redman, two of the most talented in the rap industry. Wanna mellow out? You get Busta's Lament and MoneyMaker. This is Tribe's most complete album ever. I highly recommend it for any true fan of hip-hop. Master P followers can step aside."
4,"It has many positive, upbeat songs without explicit lyrics.","my favorite song is Do you like it? where Q-Tip goes solo with the best rhymes I've ever heard. I especially loved the bonus tracks included on the CD, which added a different sound and beat than the rest of the album."
2,A Tribe Called Quest - The Love Movement,"This album is, to be frank, boring. Two stars were added because of the inclusion of the bonus tracks such as ""Hot Sex"" from the ""Boomerang"" soundtrack and the hard-to-find classic remix to ""Scenario"" (but the ""Oh My God"" remix is wack). On the other hand, those old-school tracks placed with these newer songs show just how much Tribe has fallen off. The newer songs feature boring production that makes every song sound the same and Q-Tip and Phife sound like they came in the studio saying, ""All right, but this is the last time."" This was supposed to be their swan song but they tried to make a comeback in 2003."
2,A Tribe Called Flop,"Can you say strugglin'? As much as I admire Shaheed, Phife and Q, it was all too evident on this album that the boys had been through enough and need to call it quits. The first two albums were out of this world and they established themselves as lyrical geniuses, but ever since they have been struggling to regain prominence and find their niche. Sorry, this album really isn't worth listening to."
4,3rd best tribe album,"for those who appreciate the smooth jazz sounds of""The Low End Theory"",this is one of the greatest Tribe albums ever.For those who are in awe of the same old beats,the same old rhymes as every other rapper on wax ,go back and listen to ""Beats,Rhymes,and Life""CD.As for me I just want to say THANK YOU TRIBE!for one of the best and most original rap albums since ""Low End Theory""."
1,"Wow, diz puts to me sleep...","When i heard A tribe called quest's "" the love movement"" it made me want to sleep coz its boringggggggggggggg and every song sounds exectly the same even their single ""find a way"" can put you to sleep and the most upbeat song here rock rock yall and scenario remix both plain dull and boring and it doesn't get any better but worse & worse with wack lirycs and a weak effort dat i wasn't surprise at ""a tribe called quest"" coz they suck, and their weak, and BORING. If you love real hip-hop? Dont support this watered down trash...F*ck a tribe called quest."
4,Going out with a bang...,"Face it: you couldn't get more flawless than ""Low End"" or ""Marauders"", but this is definitely notches above ""Beats..."". Q-Tip has never sounded more charismatic and self-assured, and neither has Phife. I love ""Find A Way"", ""Common Ground"", ""The Love"", ""Start It Up""...and isn't that ""Scenario"" remix the BOMB??!!?? I hate that they're ghost, but at least they left us with a rousing send-off. I love you Tribe--thans for the jams, the phat shows, and Q-Tip's sexy self!!! Keep banging!!!"
4,Tribe Called Best,"This is a gorgeous album. Not because it features some nice guest spots, and not because it has some sweet BoomClack beats, and not because the Rhodes piano and rimshots rock the house, and not because Q-Tip's voice is so simply wonderful, and not because Phife steps with precision, and not because it was the Tribe's last album, and not because the tracks have such a strong groove to them.No. This CD is wonderful for one thing:""What is it that everybody hasAnd some pirates and theives try to take?The Bootyif you is a crook you be takin' it.""You just don't find wordplay like that very often.Unfortunately, the sense of wonderful *FUN* that the Tribe is known for and that pervades that track is often lacking on this disk, so I can understand why people say it doesn't rank up with the top Tribe disks. But, hey... it's still a Tribe disk, making it better than a lot of stuff that's out there."
3,and around and around we go...,"....this isn't a bad album, but it's not special in any way either. A lot of people reading this may be quick to jump on me for saying this but..serious..every song pretty much sounds the same. This is greatly due to the light jazz-like production that in my opinion was overused. That's about it. This album is way too repetitive. I thought the sound they were trying to create was interesting how ever. I had great hopes for this piece when I first heard ""Find a Way"", their first single, and probably my favorite track on the album. The lyrical content is there..it's just all seem so subdued due to the same time running throughout the disk. ...let's hope that the breakup isn't permanent, and they come out with something more potent."
2,The break-up ends this downhill slide ...,"I've been a Tribe fan for a while, and have been waiting for this album since BR&L came out well over a year ago. It's a pretty disappointing album, all told. Too much of the production sounds exactly the same ... even worse than was the case with BR&L. Not one track of the new stuff, except possibly the track with Noreiga, has anything real interesting. The inclusion of the remixed stuff at the end was a bad idea ... every track at the end is better than almost all the stuff in the beginning. It shows how far Quest has fallen lately. That Scenario remix has been crying out for a release evre since the original Scenario 12"" dropped years ago, and the jazz and oh mi god remixes just show how great and funky the Tribe sound was in the years up to Midnight Maurauders. I hope the breakup spurs Q-Tip to some good solo projects ... I'm afraid the group's creative juices dried up after MM, and Love Movement is the musical equivalent of an open casket."
2,"i am the biggest Tribe fan, but i must say this album sucks","trully disappointing... there are some quality songs, such as find away, but too many songs were repetative and lyrics werent as intellegent as the previous albums... don't get me wrong, a tribe called quest is still one of the true representaives of Hip-Hop. i just think this album needed little more work"
4,GREAT CD,"TRIBE SHOWS THERE RIGHT NEXT TO JAY-Z. THIS CD HAS AWESOME SONGS LIKE 2,4,9,11, AND A LOT OF OTHER SONGS. ALSO GREAT GUESTS LIKE BUSTA RYHMES, REDMAN, AND NOREAGA."
5,a funky flow jamming CD,"the songs a great from #1 down the 21st. This cd should be in your selections ,,,"
5,Hip-Hop Legends,"Altough they have not been fully accepted in mainstream music, this group has still remained to prove to everyone that they manifest the art of rhyming at its pinnacle. This last installment from Quest is truly monumental and should be in every hip-hop lover's collection."
3,average for a super group,First time I heard tribe was the low end project which got me to get the other albums this album has it's bright spots but some songs like the booty is just ok i like the album . most people said it's a hit or miss you have to give it a real time to grow on you RIP JAY DILLA WHO PRODUCE CAUGHT MY EYE FOR THE EVENING
1,Death bows don't always sound good.,"I love A Tribe Called Quest. They produced some of the finest albums of any genre in the 90's, period. When I heard they were breaking up because they pretty much said it all, I was saddened. But did they have to drag that exaustion into the studio and come up with this weak piece of crap?? This is a sad album because they really sound like they're going through the motions just to fulfill their contract. Even the six extra ""rarities"" sound like throwaways. Sure, there's the odd track or two (the Busta Rhymes collaboration is brilliant), but it's not enough to spend the list price. I'm sorry. It pains me to write this what with so much crap that was released in hip-hop this year. If anything, ""The Love Movement"" is a death knell for hip-hop. I hope the Roots do better in keeping the faith."
2,"""You on point, Tribe?"" ""Uh, no.""","For the longest time I swore this was a tight album and I couldn't figure out why everyone said it was wack. I figured out about two days ago (after not listening to it for a year or two) that the reason was that I never listened past track three. Find a Way and Da Booty are both tight jams, but every other song on the album, barring the remixes, makes me sick. They have lame beats, wack rhymes, and some bad cameos (Noreaga?! Are you kidding me?) Whenever I accidentally forget to change the CD after Da Booty, I feel like an idiot for ignoring my friends' pleas not to buy this album. For the longest time I thought I didn't even like Tribe. As I listen to Low End Theory as I write this, I realize that I was mistaken. The Love Movement is a bad album and a bad way for a good group to go out."
1,WEAK,They're gonna stay homeless putting stuff like this out! Time to get real jobs (hanging around outside Amoeba music in Hollywood doesn't count) kiddos! You tried...
2,Lacks creativity and any kind of longevity.,"I have simply stopped listening to this album, because the songs get old so fast. There are so much better things to listen to out there. Go look at my listmania lists or my wish list to see what they are. This CD is a generally boring rap-rock fusion with a couple electronics as a lame attempt at originality. I now realize that the singer's voice is really annoying. It's true that these guys are homeless, but if they want to get houses they should first get better at what they do. In the same category as Adema, a truly boring and annoying band. As some other reviewers said, this group might have a good live show, but this album isnt worth your time. I bought this on an impulse and got burned (though it was cheap). Don't do the same."
1,eek........,"Well, Edgy 59 from Burning Witch is indeed still alive surprisingly, but he's somehow found himself in this band... Ughh... Story is Edgy left Burning Witch after he was offered a contract for quite a large sum of money... Such a shame, it would be great to hear what Burning Witch could have done... If you're thinking about buying this, listen to real metal and buy Burning Witch or Khanate instead..."
2,Expert Obedience Training for Dogs,"Two main comments. Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it. This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform ""tricks"" with much on showmanship. I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog. Problems handlers encounter in ""greeting"" of your dog with other dogs and people.Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on. I felt intimidated by it."
2,Very old information....,"A good book....for the 1960's. Dog training has evolved *far* past what this trainer had taught in the past. Her methods are behind the times and they show that she no longer is a serious competitor.An OK book for a historical reference, but not much use otherwise."
3,Just for Show?,"I agree with all of the reviews I read on this book, however, non of them talked about the ""show"" aspect. If I would have known how much was dedicated to getting your dog and yourself ready for shows, I think I would have passed. The first 8 chapters are great, but after that I found the information did not apply to my dog and his needs (or mine). If you are looking to enter your dog in competitions this is it. Otherwise I would look for books that would help you with your specific breed of dog. Just for the record, not all dogs respond to that ""wack on the nose"" correction, she talks so fondly about."
1,Not worth the read if you know anything about training,"I bought this because I love German Shepherds, but Strickland is an old time trainer who hasn't changed. The old pictures make the book dated as it is. If youv'e been training at all or have read more updated material don't waist time or money on this."
2,Expert Obedience Training for Dogs,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was more about training a dog for show than for obedience training. I needed to know how to train my dog how to come when called, stay, walk without pulling and general information. I never plan on showing my dog. I just want a good, obedient dog and was looking for a book that would tell me how to achieve that. I need help with a strong willed large one year old puppy. I did not find it in this book."
1,Worse than junk,This is by far the worst reel I've ever used. the trigger system worked an amazing three times before it stopped working. I spent more time trying to fix it rather than catching fish like everyone around was. Im never buying a quantum again.
3,"Wears out pretty fast, and kind of expensive","Does the job when desoldering, but after desoldering 100-200 solder points they wear out pretty fast. I'm new to desoldering so maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I didn't expect these to wear out in 30-45 minutes of desoldering."
5,Fair Trade!,Sugar is sugar right? BUT this is organic and another huge PLUS for me is that it's fair trade! I think it very important that the people that harvest this for us get compensated fairly to do so and not live in poverty while the company makes all the money. This is the way Im choosing my sugar ....
4,Sweet!,"I am the only organic nerd at work so I have resorted to a hot pot and my own coffee and tea supplies. These are great to keep in my cubicle and don't make a mess like a bag of sugar or sugar cubes would. And since there are so many, it ends up being pretty affordable per serving. My only heartburn is that since I am not ordering for a office of people, only myself, I wish that they hadn't just come loose in the box. I was hoping they would arrive in like 100 packs or something. No such luck."
4,"""should do the trick! -","to remind one to take their meds.. especially for those on a frequent basis.. fairly easy to set up although a bit small for elderly people to see"""
4,Posers??,"Conflict is one of the great old anarcho bands, I shocks me that TOM would call them posers and then urge people to listen to real music like Pennywise???? Pennywise is speed up pop punk there is not very much to say in their songs.."
4,An Old Friend,"I grew up with this book as an Impoverished Serviceman. My wife and I culled many of the secrets, enjoyed the writing, and wore it out. Slightly dated now, but an excellent Christmas gift to my two college-student grand daughters. I enjoyed giving it so much that I bought another copy to replace the one I misplaced. I ask you, who doesn't need to know how to construct a ""Board and Brick"" bookcase, draw a ""Three Prong Two Slot Blivet"", or brew beer in a trashcan? Advice about ensuring that your roommate likes the same type of peanut butter as you like is good marriage advice, as well. Great book, good read, good information, outstanding gift."
5,Monkey Ball 2,"Monkey Ball 2 is a family game that will build extraordinary eye hand coordination as you progress through it. Exciting, fun, and challenging the story mode's storyline will keep you motivated to improve your skills and get to the next event. Graphics, simplistic control, beautiful animations, and the ability to keep your eye hand coordination sharp are all excellent reasons to give this game a try. Play this game with your family in story mode and you'll be surprised who is solving which puzzles?"
3,Not as good as the first,"My family & I extremely enjoyed Super Monkey Ball, but just don't get into Super Monkey Ball 2. It's much more challenging and is not as much fun."
3,not that good,not as good as i thought it would be. but fun for young family members. i like it in general.
1,too hard,I was expecting this game to be easy but it wasnt ' i think sonic team at least shouldve added a handicapp mode on story mode where it gets easy but instead they didnt ' the levels are just to hard and annyoying and walkthroughs make it sound like the game is easy when its not
3,Monkey Balls,"While Sega has made a fine quality title, graphics are enough to turn anyone off. The game looks completely goofy but the gameplay is actualy quite good. Yet another overlooked accomplishment from Sega."
2,"Meh, it didn't live up to the hype.","There were many good reviews for this game so i assumed it would be great, but to be honest it wasn't. 2 player levels were dull and redundant, and the 1 player mode was flat out horrible. The level design was shoddy and boring and it felt like playing the same level over and over. If i were you, i would ignore the good reviews and get something else."
2,Sad,"My sister got me this game for Christas, I usually catch onto games pretty quick, and this was no execption. But you keep doing the same thing over and over again, it just wasn't fun."
3,It's OK,"I bought Super Monkey Ball 2 at my local one-stop shopping center for $20. After playing this game for about one hour, I decided that it's just not any fun. However, the graphics are OK and the character dialogue is somewhat entertaining, for the first few minutes anyway."
1,monkey ball 2,i thought this game would be good but really its repetative unoriginal the graphics are terriable laggy and ugly the mini games are terriable
4,Not very fun..,I just got this game abotu 2 days ago and it was a disappointment. It was just a monkey rolling around. You compete in little stages that only take about 2 minutes to complete. It
2,This game is not as good as you might think,"I think the Monkeys at Sega just wanted to make a few extra bannanas when they released Super Monkey Ball 2. It's basically just an update of the original game, with a few new games and a new single player format. It's really not that great, although with all the hype surrounding it, you probably think it is. By the way, I'm not one of those guys that just hates everything Sega. I used to own a Genesis, and I love most of their sports games. But this game and it's predecessor are just ridiculous. When you actually consider this games content, you'll realize how little fun rolling around in a sphere as a primate can be. This is just a warning: don't waste your money like I did. It really isn't worth it."
5,Addicting!!!,"This game is so much fun! I'm 14 and I love it! this is my first monkey ball game so I'm still learning! Anyway, some things in this game, I don't like....for example....the monkey golf....I don't like it at all, but I don't really understand it yet so thats probably why! Anyway, I highly reccomend this game! it's a lot of fun! I didn't buy it on amazon but at a local video game store. Mine is used, but it works fine. It was about the same price as a new one though. Mine was $[...] so, if you can find a new one for that price, I would reccomend buying that instead, I couldn't find a new one anywhere where I live, so I bought a used one. Great Game=Great Fun!"
4,Good game.,"This game was pretty fun, but it gets frustrating after a while. The graphics are sweet, but the story is cheesy as a Wisconsin party. My gaming pet peeve is when you figured out how to beat a level but it is so difficult and precise that it's near impossible. This game is notorious for that. But, it is still a good time waster."
5,Picture doesn't come close!,"This is a beautiful watch, looks absolutely perfect with a blue shirt or suit. The gold trim looks very nice with the blue dial. A wonderful watch at this price."
5,smokey is great,"I love smokey robinson, just love his voice. sexy. I grew up llistening to him.his one of my favorite singer,"
3,Not as good as it could have been,"While the material here is mostly 5-star, this compilation is not as complete as it should be. While the obvious hits are all here - ""Cruisin,"" ""Tracks of My Tears,"" ""Being With You,"" etc., I would like to have had ""Baby Baby Don't Cry,"" ""If You Can Want,"" and ""I'll Try Something New"" from the Miracles and the solo ""Agony and the Ecstasy."" These are all better than the two new songs, and several others included here, including ""Yester Love"" and ""I've Made Love to You a Thousand Times"" really aren't from the cream of the crop. Plus only 74 minutes - enough room left for two more Miracles tracks. The sound quality and liner notes are good, and I am glad that the complete, ""R-rated"" album version of ""Cruisin"" was included. This is good enough for the casual fan, but, for those wanting the whole picture, the two-disc compilations of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and Smokey solo are better."
3,Just okay,"Was expecting something a little more. Didn't know a lot of the songs on the CD. But my favorite song ""Cruisin"" was part of the play list."
5,"true to the trip,indeed!","this is the ultimate ""wig-out"" cd.if you're reading this you should buy it BEFORE you do what I think you're gonna do.......for real though it's a crazilly rediculous collection of all the ""material"" that they came up with when they were ""caught up in the moment"".so it would seem."
3,"It's a novel concept, but average utility","I've had this mouse and keyboard a little over a year now. It works as advertised, and the flexibility and comfort while using are worthwhile.The Good: Excellent range and accuracy. Easy setup and operation.The Bad: Battery life is not good. It lasts only 4-5 hours. I use the computer for watching TV and surfing the net. I have to constantly have it in the charger before use. If it sits out while watching a movie, it will be dead by the time it's over. The keyboard will sometimes miss the first couple keys after waking it up. I just hit the windows key twice to make sure it's paying attention.Overall, it's a great product. The battery could use improvement. Place the charger on the end table next to the recliner and everything will be fine."
2,Uncomfortable...,Be aware! This keyboard is not 'ergonomic' at all. It looks special and according to the instructions is supposed to easier to use than the normal keyboard. However the fancy design has been a hassle for me and I had a hard time to find my keys while I did not look at them. The worst thing is that the keys themselves feel cheap - I mean you would practically feel that they need to replace all the springs underneath... Don't buy it again. Gonna abandon it and buy a Logitech one which I used and liked before.
