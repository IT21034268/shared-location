4,Great book!,"Good gracious, fan me! This book is hot, hot, hot! I read it a few months back and I am still thinking about it!"
4,Can't get enough of E.J.D.,"After reading Eric Jerome Dickey's book, Cheaters, I must admit that I can't get enough of his stories!!! I was immediately hooked from the first page to the last, so much so, that I took the book everywhere with me!! E.J.D. creates a scenerio where you can truly identify with one or all of his characters. I laughed, got angry, and was in suspense throughout the entire novel. I completed the book in 2 days and hurried to the library so that I could start on another one of his dynamic novels. This man can truly breathe the breath of life in each and every character, and am waiting for the day that one of his best sellers will hit the movie screen. Keep up the good work because, I just can't get enough of E.J.D.!!!!"
5,"SEXY, FUNNY, REALISTIC ............","I HADN'T READ A NOVEL IN A WHILE AND AS I WENT TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN BOOK CART AT THE MALL ALL I DOULD FIND WERE BOOKS THAT SEEMED TOO ""DRAMATIZED"" FOR ME WHEN I PICKED IT UP BECAUSE THE TITLE REMINDED ME OF SOME OF MY EX BOYFRIENDS. EVERYONE WHO STOPPED AT THE CART KEPT SAYING HE IS A BRILLIANT WRITER AND THE BOOK IS GREAT I TOOK IT HOME AND COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN IT FELT LIKE I REALLY RELATED TO IT EVEN THOUGH I AM 19 TRUST ME MY AGE GROUP WIL LUV THIS BOOK NOT TO MENTIONE HIS WAY WITH WORDS DURING THE INTIMATE SCENES ..NOW I AM HIS NUMBER ONE FAN I JUST READ LIARS CLUB IT IS EXCELLENT WHO KNEW A MAN COULD WRITE SUCH EXQUSITE WORK AND BE SO DEEP AND REAL AT THE SAME TIME"
5,"It's so funny, it's scary!","As a married person, you are no longer familiar with the games that people play. However, I live vicariously through the eyes of my friends and the stories that they share with me and most of what they have said was written in this book. It's funny to read that others go through the same nonsense and it was so true to life that it was scary!This was another great book by Eric Jerome Dickey and I can't wait to read his upcoming novel!Bravo!"
3,It was ok.,"This is my first time reading any of Mr. Dickey's books. It was an ok book. I have to say though, some of the characters in the book, were very ghetto and acted a bit much childish. Stephan needed to just slow down and learn how to be by himself. I mean he would jump from one women to the next to the next. Darnell, my goodness how does he end up just up and moving to Paris to be with Tammy. Not very realistic at all. Or is it? The book started off slow, but as I read on it began to pick up with interest. All in all this was an ok book. I plan to read more of Mr. Dickey's books."
3,Don't Cheat,"A book of conscience. Through it, I grew to appreciate the growth that every adult should seek. A reminder that there is always a consequence for our actions."
4,"Good, but not as good as the others . . .","I think that 'Cheaters' is a very good book, but it does'nt have that certain sumthin' all of the other books have. The story seemed off to a slow start and did'nt begin to get really good until almost the end. So Eric, if you read these reviews you might want to think about a 'Cheaters II'??...Maybe...huh...huh...maybe? I for one would really enjoy that. In this age of people being so in a hurry, I can appreciate a writer who takes his/her time to entertain me for my hard earned $17.-$20. You're one of those authors that you don't have to read a review and then decide if you should buy the book. When a new one comes out you just go and get it, because you know it's going to be good. To me that says a lot. Keep up the good work."
4,Good.,"I enjoyed this book... However, sometimes I wonder to men who write about women beleive the things they write..."
5,This book was the bomb baby. All that and then some!!!!!,This book captures the true meaning of cheating. It informs brothers and sisters what the consequences are when you are playing with someone's heart and emotions. Mr. Dickey captured the true spirit of the characters. And some of the stunts they pulled had me laughing out loud like the highway scene when Ole girl chases brother man down with the car. She got him ghetto style. I hope that brothers and sisters learn from this and begin to act right and realize that when you feel betrayed and hurt the smartest most educated person can turn into an insane person. Keep up the good work Jerome. I can't wait for the next one. I have them all. Peace.
5,YOU GO BOY!!!!!!,"What more can i say other than i LOVED this book! This has got to be EJD's best work ever. Please continue with the flow and hey how come everybody has to be so triflin and i do mean EVERYBODY!!!! So in closing i just want to say MORE, MORE, MORE."
3,Sounds too familiar,"Yada....yada....yada! This was a okay book to read, but it sounds so much like the other Contemporary black novels written today. If you have read Michael Baisden's ""Men Cry In The Dark"", you would think the characters from this book were in the same story line with his. Also who was the editor of this book??? It was filled with typos, grammatical errors and incomplete sentences. I think EJD is a great writer, but needs to slow down. At the end he zoomed through like he got tired of it himself."
3,What kind of ending was that??,"With all the exciting and/or dramatic endings of Eric's other books, I am a little disappointed in the way Cheaters ended. There was entirely too much happening in the lives of the characters in the last TWO pages of the book. It was moreso a summary that needed to be expanded upon instead. I felt that the ending was too rushed. Personally, the book could have gone on another 5 or 6 chapters and there would have been no complaints!"
2,How about Sleepers!,This is the first book that I have read by Eric Dickey. It taking me forever to read this book. By the third chapter I've forgotten the main charcters names.I don't know where the author is taking his readers to. I hope the others books are better thanG this one.Sorry
5,GO DICKEY!!!,"BOY OH BOY, OH BOY.... ONCE YOU START THIS BOOK, YOU WILL NOT PUT IT DOWN!! THIS WAS MY FIRST BOOK OF EJD'S THAT I READ, AND IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY ONE OF MY FRIENDS. I'M NOT GOING TO SPOIL IT FOR YOU BY TELLING YOU THE STORY- BUT OVERALL, 4 CHARACTERS- STEPHAN, CHANTE, TAMMY, AND DARNELL..IT'S FUNNY HOW THEY ALL MEET AND GET TOGETHER, AND THE BOOK IS HOT! TALKS ABOUT HOW THESE 2 CHEATERS GET THEIR GAME ON, GET CAUGHT..AND I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ANYMORE..U GOTTA READ THE BOOK.."
5,Hits Home with the Hardest Bat,"EJD---Daymn brotha you just hit upon where I was at in my life right when I picked up this book! I was slightly disappointed in Milk but you restored my faith in your realistic writing. This book is written with so much feeling and emotion from both the male and female perspective. I enjoyed every character, every word and every page...Thank you again for writing such a beautiful book!"
5,"This book was interesting, wonderful, real...",Eric Jerome Dickey is one of the most interesting writers thatI've encountered. This book was so detailed that I was able to invisioneach character and each event. I can't wait for his next book. EJD keep up the good work!!!
5,TRUE TO LIFE,"This book is one of the best yet to come from Eric Jerome Dickey. I was totally captivated with all the characters in this book. It seemed as if he captured the lives of myself and all of my friends (male and female) while writing this book. I don't know how he will outdo this one, but I can't wait for the next novel."
2,Not his best,"Eric has horrible ending for all his books. I love his books, but they are all starting to sound alike."
3,Woman's Perspective from a Man's Point of View,"The book was good, I can not refute that, but it left me hanging. As a reader I expected the story to end with the woman's closure and yet it didn't, it ended with our suggested hero of the story who was as much of a cheater as everyone else in the book if not worse. It left me desiring to know how the women truly felt but I never found out because the book was male dominated, male written and from a Man's Point of View even though it had many overtones of a woman's perspective."
5,FAV. BOOK,"Eric Jerome Dickey has did it again. Cheaters is a must have for the year. I love this book, i know it like the back of my hand. I've read it five times already and steady reading it. I've shared this book with all my family and friends. They love it as well, I loved Chante she was the best character of them all. She was very realistic she reminded me of my aunt. So everyone this a book you should have on your book shelf. So pick it up at your local Borders book store and read it over and over again."
5,CHEATERS....CHEATERS....CHEATERS,"I loved this book. This book had trust, distrust, loyalty, commitment, and everything else in a relationship. This book expressions that not only men cheat, but women too. It's a great example of how life and relationship is in a real world. In CHEATERS Eric Jerome Dickey paints a sassy, sexy portiat of men, women, and modern morals__in a high-spirited roller-coaster ride of a novel about the risks and rewards of falling in love.NIcholett J. 5th PROSSER H.S"
4,CHEATERS,"CHEATERS IS EJD BEST, ALL THE CHARACTERS YOU WILL FEEL FOR. THEY WILL YOU WANT TO CHEAT BUT NOT GET CHEATED ON."
5,Very entertaining,"I have two small children and this is the first novel I've finished in a long time.I saw Mr.Dickey a year or two ago at the Barnes and Noble in Cerritos.He was charming and so are his books.Cheaters was a fun and quick read, like Valleey of the Dolls or Princess Daisy. Perfect for a summer read, cool and frothy."
4,Keeps going and going...,"I picked up this book because I had read the other EJD books and hadnt read one in a while. If I didnt have to go to work, I probably would not have dropped the book because it reads very fast.He does a great job with the characters and one can readily identify with the characters and their struggles. The characters go through what many go through though in different degrees, from Chante who struggles with defining what she wants from a relationship and with who to Darnell who in his typical male behaviour does not voice his concerns with his wife until it is too late. The book also shows how guys in general tend to cover for themselves when they ""play"" women in their relationships and how women (a la Karen and Chante) seem to compete for the same pool of men often leading to petty jealousies and back stabbing attitudes.I finished the book yesterday and bought his new book Liar's Game today and I hope that proves to be a good read as well."
5,Excellent! A Must Reader!,"Mr Dickey,You are one of the Bourbon Street Bookclub's favorite authors. Cheaters was chosen for the book of the month and I have to admit that you have never failed us yet. :-) It's hard to believe how you can write both point of views.I could identify with the characters of your book. Especially Darnell, Dawn, and Tammy characters. I found myself looking into my own relationship.I always have to force myself not to thumb ahead and work backwards ... but I become so anxious to see what happens since you are known to throw a little surprise at the end (i.e. Milk in my Coffee)Since you are working on your next book ... how about giving our bookclub a little hint of the release date so we can add it to our COMING SOON page. It gives us something to really look forward to. (bookclub@rocketmail.com)"
5,"have not read ""Cheaters"" yet , can't wait","Eric Jerome Dickey is the best author ever. I can't put his books down. I'm so excited about ""Cheaters"", can't wait to read it. I can't decide which book I like best, they are all great. Eric, keep up the excellent work."
3,"Ok, Ok...","It's not that this guy's a bad writer, it's just that he's TOTALLY unexciting. Which can be worse than being bad sometimes, I think."
5,True to life reading,"I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your latest book, Cheaters. It really was a book about real people. I can't tell you how much I could relate to this book. I either knew someone that experienced these things or I had experienced them myself. I truly could relate to the term, ""Possession"". You are a very good writer and I look forward to reading your next book. Sincerely, P Wms"
5,Eric does it again,"Once again Eric Jerome Dickey entertains us with another satisfying, page turning novel. You'll love his witty, down to earth, and sometimes 'typical' characters....walking a trail of despair, and often destruction. But you know in the end...Eric always paints us a rainbow!"
4,Scan-du-lus,"This book kept me up all night turning pages. Eric Jerome Dickey does not disappoint, again. I really enjoyed this book. The things the characters did in this book had me laughing and trippin. The author manages to always give you both sides of the story, so you never get the impression that he is more for one side or the other. Both women and men do wrong and are wronged. The characters are complex, down to earth and all have facets in their personalities that we all can relate to. This is a great book and if you like this one, be sure to check out all his other books."
5,Breath-taking,I really enjoyed this book. I have read all of Dickey's books and every one of them is better than the last. I think everyone should read this book; you might see someone you know or yourself through the characters.
5,A WONDERFUL READ,Dickey has over done himself once again. This book is great. It keeps you reading and you do not want to put the book down. Cheaters is great. Chante' and Stephan keep you wondering what is up next. I am waiting to read his next literary masterpiece.
5,"""OOOOOOOOO-Wee""","I've never read a book more than once, but there was so much going on in Cheaters (well, let's just say there's a first time for everything). This book had me laughing out loud. I laughed so hard at Toyomi, I threw my book down and lost my page once. This book was absolutely FANTASTIC. At one time, I thought NOBODY could outdo E. Lynn, but Mr. Dickey, you get all props from this book. Keep it coming!!! Bravo, Bravo!!! I'm on my way out right now to buy ""Sister, Sister"" I don't know how much better your writing can get, but I'm dying to see."
1,Mark's View,This book is just another sad depiction of the Black Male and Black Female. When will we realize the that persons portrayed in this book are in need of psychiatric help. Mr. Dickey rambles on about a group of self-centered narcissistic so called adults. Save your money on this one.
4,Nothing is Perfect,"I loved this book. This book had trust, distrust, loyalty, commitment, and everything else in a relationship. Stephan played a great character. He was raised in a home with no father until his step-father. His father was a cheater so he later had some of those ""cheater"" qualities. Toyomi played a great character. She was like a ""ghetto queen"". When it came to back stabbing and getting revenge she was your girl. I don't believe in adultery , but I loved the way Darnell cheated on his wife. His wife treated him [badly] and he just kinda got sucked into the ""game"". The way he left her at the end of the book was great. He said I leaving, and don't try to contact me."
5,Good to the last drop!,"Hello ladies and gents' You have to read Eric's delicious New book ""Cheaters"" I read it in three days. Eric thanks for visiting DC"
5,GREAT FROM BEGINNING TO END,"I haven't read many books that are strictly about African-Americans, but I must say I would recommend this book to ""all"" of my friends. The way that Eric Jerome Dickey wrote the female characters was so real, it's hard to believe that it came from a man, especially the ""love scenes."" It's amazing that he could describe the way we feel and think - almost made me think he could've been a woman! Although this book was a great read, it also makes me happy to be married. I'd love to see this book made into a movie. I've already decided to get Milk In My Coffee. Keep the books coming!"
4,Good book,"I think that this was a very good book it shows the ups and downs of being a ""playa"" and the characters were very entertaining."
5,Great Reading,"Oh I so enjoyed this book, I read it in 4 days it was so good I couldn't put it down until I'd read the whole book, I was a little up set in the middle of the book, but all in all everything turned out o. k. I'm going to purchase my next book tomorrow, by him. Thanks."
5,This book was GOOD!,This book made me think that there are a lot of women dogs as well as men dogs. This book was very good as well as his other books. I felt as if I was there during every chapter. I commend him on all the good work he's done. Job weel done.
4,I loved it!,"This book is not what I expected, it was better. It was so good that I didn't want it to end! Dickey is an excellent storyteller and he wove a seamless tale of friendship, heartache, and conflicted emotions -- the stuff of real life interpersonal relationships. In this cast of characters, the author has included a couple of ""dogs"", a vamp, a nag, a wannabe militant, a frustrated lawyer/writer and an artsy tpe.I enjoyed this book a lot more than ""Sister, Sister"" because the characters are more sympathetic. I also liked the fact that the author didn't come up with fairy tale ending. He spins an interesting tale about folks looking for love (or lust) and the consequences of of bad choices."
4,A change from the normal boy meets girl story ... Recommend,"This is the second book by Eric's that I have read. I though it would be hard for him to follow up on his other book ""Friends and Lovers"", but I was wrong. This book kept me up reading late into the nights (which I hate). The characters are believable and very up with the modern times, but if you don't agree then I would like to take a quote from what the man said.... ""It's only fiction "". So if you are looking for something good to read or something that is different from the normal boy meets girl story then this is for you."
4,Good book!,"The plot could have been stronger. Nonetheless, there were times I was wide smiles and all giggles. It was a good read. Would recommend it."
5,Magnificant Book,"So far of all the EJD books I have read, Cheaters is the best. From the beggining to the end, this book had me really into it. For all the people who would like to read this book, go ahead. You will be amazed by all the ups and downs these characters have, and the shockers."
3,Duplicate,Item for sale did not show the selections that were on the CD. When it arrived I compared it with the CD I already had and they were all there.
3,Good for perusal only,"I am a student of health sciences in USA, and I picked this book for a comparison on US and Japan and germany health care system and policy. I was interested in the book, it was well written, but it provided me with no detail insight into the real mechanismas of health care policy abroad. I would only recommend this to people who do not have to analyse the topic for course work."
5,Great Pizza Pan,"Go to YouTube and search Mario Bateli. See how he does his pizza, and you will never do it the old way again."
4,"solid, but heavy","It is solid iron sheet, but it is heavy and takes two hands to left it out of the oven. It also needs to be preheat before cooking a frozen pizza or the bottom doesn't get crisp."
5,Best Pzza Pam Hands down,I just want to re affirm what every other person has said here about this pizza pan. If you like pizza you will be doing your self a real favor by getting this pan. You never have really experienced what is possible in home cooked pizza until you have cooked it on the Lodge Pizza Pan.
5,Lodge Cast Iron pizza Pan,"Best pan ever! Just watch out for the handles! You may find yourself stretching the crust out a little more to reach the rim, but since it has to be prewarmed those handles are hot! Keep the covers on them!"
5,Really impressed,"I bought this for multiple uses- pizza,crepe,and pancakes. I have to say it is great to use.The key is keeping it seasoned with oil. Definitely recommend."
5,Great for artisan breads,"Haven't used on pizza yet, but have used a couple times on breads. No more broken baking stones to replace! This will be around longer than me! Very heavy so I don't like having to put away in bottom cupboards. Solution was to use as decorative tray on counter holding a few small kitchen items (salt,pepper,napkins), so it is handy to reach when needed."
5,lodge cast iron pizza pan,"I concur with most reviewers that this is best pizza cookware I have ever used. It beats pizza stones, quarry stones and all the other metal pans, hands down. I read all the reviews before buying and found the suggestion to partially cook the rolled out dough to be a great idea.One suggestion is to season it - multiple times. Use flax seed oil in wiped-off thin layers. There are websites that give detailed directions for this. I seasoned our pan 8 times until it has almost a glassy shine.In order to avoid scratching the surface while cutting pieces, I remove the pie from the pan with a wooden pizza peel, cut the pieces and return the remaining pie to the cast iron pan to keep warm.I have been making pizza for years but now it will be on our table much more often because this pan has made the process much easier, faster and with consistently great results."
5,crispy crust and tuff as iron- Ignore manufactures cooking instructions,"I am done braking pizza stones!!!!Simply instructions as follows:Ignore pizza cooking instructions from manufacturer. (Hillbillies are better at BBQ.)Place iron pizza pan in cool oven.Pre heat oven and iron pizza pan to 550 for 15 minutes.Prepare pizza dough on parchment paper on top of a flat baking sheet.(or pizza peal)Add sauce and toppings.Slide pizza and parchment paper onto hot iron pizza pan.Remove parchment paper after dough hardens, one or two minutes. (Spatula and tongs or fingers)Watch for desired amount browning 5-10 minutes.Remove pizza with spatula to wire rack, cool for 3 minutes.Allow iron pizza pan to cool completely in oven.Wash when cool."
2,Not impressed with the results...,"This pizza pan appears well made from the standpoint that the metal is nice and flat and robust, and the handles are comfortable and such. Unfortunately the claim that it's ""pre-seasoned"" and that foods won't tend to stick to it is NOT what I've experienced. What's with the bumpy surface? I've got several older Wagner cast iron pans that are smooth as glass where you place the food and they truly are what I would consider to be non-stick. If you end up buying this make sure you double the recipe each time because half of your food will be left stuck on the pan for you to scrub off later."
3,Only buy if you really want to deal with cast iron.,"It cooks pizzas beautifully, but it is pretty difficult to clean and maintain. I can never get it quite clean, and it rusts very easily. I've been using this pizza pan for over a year, and if I had it to do over again, I personally would go with a stone because of the drawbacks of the cast iron.I do like that it can be used on the grill, though. It is also possible to simulate the heat of a brick oven with this pan by getting it really hot on the stove (begin heating it gradually, then crank the heat up to high once it's hot) and transferring it to the oven and baking your pizza under the broiler on high. It will only take a couple of minutes, though, so keep an eye on your pizza!"
5,Pizza or Crepe Pan,"I use this for crepes, and it does a great job! evenly distributes heat and makes BIG crepes!"
1,Really bad product! Don't waste your money on this.,"So this is the highest rated for pizza stones? I bought because of the rave reviews and reasonable price. It seemed to work well at first - nich & heavy, seemed good quality and it held up for a few months of regular use - then came the peeling. Yes, there is a coating that peels off and leave little black chips in your food. Of course it is now too late to return. Do yourself a favor and buy something else."
2,To much clean up,"The product produces a credible pizza, but no better then the $14.00 bakes square pans.The clean up is to time consuming,the inability to use a soap product is a major problem.When we make pizza it's for a mob scene, atleast five pizzas are made. After we eat I let the Bakers Sq. pans soak in dishwasher detergent and I can clean the up in no time."
1,Soggy pizza crust,"I bought this thinking it would make for crispy, yummy pizza crusts. Instead they are soggy and unappetizing. I found myself parbaking on this pan then moving the crust to the pizza stone to finish baking. I've even quit using it for parbaking, and am back to using the $3 Walmart pan.Also the weight of this pan makes it difficult to deal with, plus the fact it has to be handwashed....overall I definitely would not recommend it."
5,"Awesome for pizza, bacon, pancakes",This is great. For pizza I stack it on top of a pizza stone and pour the kettle full of lump charcoal. Season it with a little bacon grease. No complaints at all.
5,Great Cast Iron Pizza Pan,This pan creates a nice crisp crust on the bottom of the pizza. I pre-heat the pan in the oven first then slide the pizza onto the pan. It comes out great.And while you eat your piece of pizza the other pieces stay warm while on the pan.
5,Buy this you will not be disappointed.,"I have spent mucho bucks on seeking the best homemade pizza... pizza stones, pizza bricks all of it... could have just got this and call it a life... Put it on the top rack for 40 minutes on high.. slide your pizza and turn on your broiler.. 4 minutes later perfect pizza... check it out... it is how Mario Batali cooks em in Boston... Cast Iron rocks plus you can use it on a induction burner as a warm plate.."
5,"better results, twice as fast as using my pizza stone",The cast iron pizza pan takes up heat so much quicker than the pizza stone I have been using. Pre-heating it even 20 minutes in a hot oven (450+ degrees) is enough to get a beautifully crusty pizza. I can never get a comparable result from the stone without pre-heating it at least an hour. Top Marks to Lodge for this one!
5,Amazing!,"Just used this for the first time. It is AMAZING. It helps that I have a fantastic pizza dough recipe, too! Buy this and you'll be glad you did."
5,Love it for runny gluten free pizza crusts,"I bought this as an early Valentines Day/Anniversary gift for my husband (romantic I know...). He is following a gluten free diet, yet still misses pizza. All of the gluten free pizza dough recipes we have found have been extremely runny and ran right off our pizza stone. This pan is perfect...it heats evenly and the lip keeps the dough (or almost batter) contained."
5,Yes..finally found something that works,"Makes awesome pizza! Heat it up, use like a stone, and it won't break. Makes great biscuits too! I also use it for gluten free, polenta pizza and it makes a wonderful, crunchy crust. SO happy I bought this."
4,pizza stone might have been a better option,"I like this pan for cooking pizza lot, the main problem I have with it is that I usually use a pizza stone to help my oven hold heat as well and just left it in the oven full time. You can't do that with a cast iron pan, the seasoning flakes off and you have to re-season it before using it then. Keeping that in mind, it has still been really useful both on the stove and in the oven, it is much more versatile than a stone would be."
4,Durable and entertaining for a 9 month old,My son is 9 months old and this toy makes him smile and laugh. He also loves how the toy vibrates.
5,Tickle Me Elmo is fun for all ages!,I purchased Tickle Me Elmo for my granddaughter and she LOVES it as does everyone who visits her and plays with him. He is addictive to the funny bone.
1,Worked for two months,My two-year old loves Elmo and I was so excited for him to have this toy. It worked for about 2 months. Now he's got a really expensive stuffed Elmo that doesn't do anything.
2,sound fair/quality of unit poor,We bought this for our 11 year old daughter for christmas. The microphone is real not some cheesy plastic thing but the unit itself is not well made. The two cassette player doors don't align just right and feel like they could break at any moment. The CD that came with it was scratched and had ... songs on it. The sound quality was fair but not worth the price. I am wondering if the STVG700 model with the monitor built in is any better? My husband and I debated over the SMG320 and the STVG700. I just can't help but wonder if we made the wrong choice or if both units are poor quality.
1,Karaoke Machine,I had a sleepover and I broght my machine and my frend Mary brought hers I was proud and all because mine costed way more and I turned mine on and Mary turned hers on after me and I could not even hear mine and hers did everything it came with 50 recording cd disks and you could record your own albem I can't do anything she can do and she can do everything I could do I was so imbarest you don't want to be imbarest do you? so get the better one at Radio Shack for only$50.00 No I am not a radio shack sales person I just tell the TRUTH unlike the Karioke mchine that riped me OFF.
2,Much better in the photo than real life,"These look quite nice in the photo, but in real life they are bigger than they appear, and the finish is not as nice. I had one lose a prong already after only 2 uses."
1,You wish these were THE ones,"These seem like they should be the ones that last forever. But the things they advertise as being great about these is their downfall. They are TOO heavy, fall out and you have to keep re-sticking them to try to find a better spot. Overall, stick with the little plastics ones that you have to buy over and over again because they work much better AND what's wrong with having to buy a new set every year. Stay away from these. They aren't what you think."
2,not that impressed,"Im not very impressed with Anthony compared to other hosts on traveling programs, some of the content is to adult for children"
5,Incredible Historical Fiction,This was one of those books I picked up from the bookshelf on my way out the door to catch a plane for a week-long trip. It made the 5 hour lay-over at DIA seem like 5 minutes. I was exhausted the entire trip because I stayed awake in bed with a flashlight into the wee hours of the morning reading. The descriptions and character development are unsurpassed. I also highly recommend the video by the same title - view only AFTER reading the novel. Zola strikes me as the French Dickens. Also fabulous - Zola's THERESE RAQUIN.
2,OK.,The table came in about 100000000 different pieces to put together. Pain in the butt! Directions are good but such a hassle putting together. Much smaller in size then I thought it would be but has room for clothes and storage. Works for us just fine.
4,Jr Wardrobe,Easy to put together and looks nice in a small room without being overbearing. Used Prime for delivery and it was here in one day. Good produce.
2,Missing pieces????,I ordered this for my childs room to give it a cleaner look! It came in 2 boxes. My husband and I got all the pieces layed all out and tried to start to put it together the first step of the instructions I know something was wrong. There were no tracks for the drawers and no bottoms for the drawers???? I instantly looked every where and they were seriously not there. I called up the company and there shipping out the missing peices but it will take 5-7 days to get here and I already had put my childs old dressers to the curb and someone took them... so now she has a huge pile of clothes in her room... I am highly disapointed with this company they refused to expidite the shipping of the missing part even though it was there fault!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Contains Incorrect Information for Sleeping With the Enemy,"While this cd is excellent, it lost two stars.The main reason I bought it was for ""Symphonie Fantastique,"" that ominous classical music piece in the movie ""Sleeping With the Enemy.""While the cd was correct in titling the said piece as ""Symphonie Fantastique,"" they had the wrong movement.They had movement I, Dreams and Passions.The actual movement that contains this ""ominous"" piece, with the horns and bells, is Movement 5, Dies irae.A bit disappointing to buy a cd, then listen to it, just to have it be the wrong movement.It is either a mistake or false advertising. Either way you slice it, I didn't get what I paid for here.However, the rest of the cd is wonderful."
2,Bad - don't buy unless a devoted fan,"I bought this album after hearing one song off another album - ""My Heart Is The Bums On The Street"" - which is absolutely brilliant. This album on the other hand - excluding the first song, which is decent - is a blatant attempt at mainstreaming things. Lyrics can be good, but music is basically everything and the kitchen sink thrown in, subtlety be damned. Big chords, lots of distortion, lots of nothing special. Luckily I got it used for $3.99.Gave it 2 stars because first song is ok."
2,tell me this is just a dream,"Is it possible that I dozed off for a few moments, and then dreamed that one of my favorite bands came out with an album with a big pink bubblegum bubble on it and a sound equally as tacky and disturbing? Is it just a dream that I saw Marah on an NBC news special whining about how they hope people start buying CDs and stop burning mp3s so that they don't have to work at Starbucks, just after releasing one of the most radio-friendly, yet somehow sloppiest records of the year? Is it just a nightmare that these incredible musicians, these huge Springsteen fans, finally get the Boss himself to appear on a record with them, and then the record is mediocre, at very best? Well, at least Bruce's ""The Rising"" is good... damned wonderful, it is. Until Marah comes back, stick with the original, not with the currently sidetracked derivatives."
1,Disappointing,"I heard the single, ""Float Away With the Friday Night Gods"", prior to the release of the CD and hoped that the rest of the CD would be better than the single. Wow, my hopes were dashed. Really, this stuff isn't even good pop music. Too bad, bcause ""Kids in Philly"" is fantastic. One of my favorite CDs period. Marah seems to want to get fame and fortune. No problem with that. However, they are further away now than they were with their previous release. Buy ""Kids in Philly"". Stay away from this sadly, very poor CD."
1,"What next, electronica?","The Marah sound is gone. As soon as I heard the band was using the same producer who handled Oasis, I became trepidatious. This stuff is OK, it's catchy, and I even found myself humming one of the tunes after listening. That of course was in spite of myself. There was a richness and purity in the previous albums that is simply non-existent here. This is pop sugar at its best. Or worst. The beautiful warm sounds of the acoustic guitars and banjos are gone. Instead we get overly produced, synthesized sounds. Even the vocals are put through effects. At a time like this, we need more purity, not less. So let them have their one hit with Float Away and then disappear into oblivion. All the original fans will be gone by the time they realize they made a mistake. And then, truly they will be able to sing, ""All of the streets are lonely..."""
2,Perhaps the old rhythm section wrote the lyrics?,"I agree with those that admire Marah's decision to do whatever they want to do and, as a fan, I was eager to hear them take on a new sound. And this is not a bad album, but it just lacks any specificity and sounds like so many other, lesser bands. ONe thing that strikes me is how weak the lyrics are compared to the original and surprising work on the first two albums. It would seem that this complexity and energy might be retained whatever the musical directions the band chooses to pursue?"
2,The best CD Oasis never made,"An OK CD if you like Oasis. I'm not against a band moving on from it's roots (I loved Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot) but go somewhere new. It seems like Marah didn't want a new sound, they wanted someone else's sound. I won't call them sellouts because it is a very good bunch of music, it's just not Marah"
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I read a good review of this band in Modern Twang (okay, it was written in 1998) and just finished listening to this CD for the first time. After reading the previous reviews I concluded I picked up the wrong Marah CD. Oh well, even though I probably won't keep Float Away, I'll look for Kids In Philly or Let's Cut The Crap.I dislike this for the same reason I don't like bands such as New Pornographers...too much noise."
4,"Not really a review, but go on","To the bitter, ""college reporter"" who posted his review of Marah's new album, I have two things to say to you:1.) There is NO WAY that a band like Marah, with so much potential and so much enthusism would give a darn what a college reporter like yourself would write about their new album. I am really believing that with all the touring and promotion they are doing now, that they would waste a milli-second on you. Maybe you should get a new hobby and stop creating ""fiction"" online.2.) Anyone that would give the Stokes album a good review while thrashing this one is a corporate rock music junkie. Get a clue and get a life.To everyone else, this is a good album - full of catchy tunes and thoughtful lyrics. Sure, it is no KIP2, but it certainly deserves a listen or two.At least that's what the hottest chicks in New York think."
1,An embarrassment,"With this new CD, Marah has proven themselves to be an embarrassment to Philadelphia. This new release is downright awful - musically and lyrically. It's almost comical. Don't waste your money like I did."
1,"congrats, Marah, you have acheived mediocrity","I had been a Philly based Marah fan since ""Let's Cut the crap and hook up later on tonight"". Everything I liked about them is what they left off this album; a sound that stood out against the cloning of top 40 radio, distinctive vocals and interesting lyrics. It may be the opinion of some that a lot of the local Marah fans were disgruntled by the band's exodus from philly and their departure from the same old sound. Personally, I don't care where they go or what sound they try for: as a music fan, it is apparent to me that they had a sound that evoked motion,emotion and grabbed my attention and now they've got a sound that is about as appealing, interesting and unique as white castle hamburgers. Way to go, boys. At least you're not claiming to represent Philly with this crap."
4,Great CD,"This is a very good CD. I am not a new fan of the band. I own their first 2 CD's and love them both. I think the critics and fans alike are being way to hard on the band. There are some great instantly hummable songs on this CD. What is wrong with a band wanting to be more popular anyways. I think the band has kept its integrity and made a CD they wanted to make. The fact that they may have targeted a larger audience is OK too. I would much rather hear any song off this CD on the radio than most all the ... that is played on radio today. To all the alt country purists out there, lighten up and enjoy a very good rock CD."
5,Booty-shakingKhmerloungepopyoucanchantto,"All right, I'm a NUT for Asian music (this CD arrived in the same package as Kronos Quartet's rendition of classic Bollywood), but as I listened I couldn't help but twist a little in the kitchen. To call this fusion is to sell it short--this is music, with no style labels to dissect it and let the musicaologists pigeonhole. I wanted to throat in a little kargyraa underneath it all, because this stuff lends itself to everything under the sun (and under rocks). This disc is going to sit in my player a long time."
5,Cambodian American with a 60s Feel,I learned about this band on NPR. They got together after hearing 60s music rock music from Cambodia and decided to recreate it. They found a female singer fluent in Khmer to sing lead and off they went. It's so enjoyable and fun. The music has been featured on Weeds and True Blood. Buy it they are great!
4,The hoist was a good investment,"Recently purchashed this planer, the DJ-20 jointer and Delta dust collector. Same time I picked up a fold-up engine hoist. These guys are real heavy. Assembly was easy, with the hoist & nylon straps to do the lifting.The Planer works flawlessly after futzing with the roller table assembly/alignment. The largest I had to give it was 12"" black walnut and it came out beautifully and without straining. Only Thing I don't like is that the dust collector (optional) port is like 5"" so my hoses don't fit. And I think you really need dust collector with this thing, unless you don't mind being up to your knees in chips. Had to modify the dust collector (cut the crossbar out of inlet), either that or change it's name to insta-plug.I was woried about the steel feed roller leaving marks but it doesn't unless you don't cut, then their minimalSaw minimal snipe once but not since, go figure."
3,Needed book for school,"I needed this book for one of my graduate classes for social work. It is a very typical text book kind, the writing isn't very interesting but the material is."
4,Great,"Not an album that really rates higher in my books for Starflyer besides Fashion Focus. Very similar to that album, as each song is in itself, it's own entity. Where as Leave Here A Stranger, had each and every song blend to fit in a whole, this album, while cohesive, has every song represent itself as well. Very good rock, very much along the lines of the rock sound acheived on Americana, however, with some weird keyboard lines, hand claps, and noises in general thrown in for good measure. Definitely a great Starflyer album."
4,Heart full of wine,i love the quiet songs on this cd. The acoustics are great and the singers voices are beautiful. my only complaint is that there are not enough souns on the album
3,poor waranty service,I recieved my pacific salt a few days ago. its a beautiful knife although i would prefer g10 handles. I gave a 3 star ranking because i recieved a cut from the opening hole (the hole in the blade that assists in the opening of the knife). I contacted spyderco and was told that if i wanted to ship it back for warranty work i would have to pay for shipping both ways.
1,I Thought Toy Engineers Were Better Than This!,This transformer is a pain to transform from robot to vehicle mode and when you put the launcher in her arm it will never stay up to allow for any good poses!
2,Cheap production quality,"I agree with the other reviewer's comments regarding the production quality of this book. I've had mine for almost two months and the pages are already falling out. This dictionary should be made sturdily since part of its appeal is that it is ""concise,"" and small enough to carry around. A pox on you, Harper Collins, for putting good material into such a shoddy package."
5,underground gold,"I had never heard of DJ Spinna, but this cat is real. I kinda bought this album before listening to it(it was only .01 cent) but i was very pleased!"
2,Old batteries from 2004,"The 392/384 batteries arrived quickly but the battery packages all say 2004. Presumably this is the date of manufacture. Seems unlikely these batteries will last for long.I ordered 3 of these batteries for a lazer pointer. This is the 3rd supplier I have bought button batteries from via Amazon and the other two were cheaper but also supplied batteries dated 2004, and they did not last very long. I think I will head to my local store in future, then at least you can check the date of manufacture before purchasing.Also, I was under the impression that 392/384 was the same as LR44, but they are actually smaller. According to another battery website, 392 = LR41, 357 = LR44."
4,very pleasant to listen to,"I really enjoy listening to this cd. I play it during the day when I am in my office. It's relaxing, and it allows me to enjoy some of my old favorite songs."
3,Not Worth the Money,"This ""sports"" towel is OK, but not what I had in mind when I bought it. And for the price and size of the towel it is not worth the money. Most of the money must go to the NFL, it isn't for the towel."
4,Good storytelling,"This was my first time reading this author and I enjoyed the story a lot. Great characters, lovely description of the area and an enjoyable plot. I was happy to find a British author that's new to me."
4,Good Read,I started reading this series of books and didn't think I'd like them. I was surprised and have read four of them now and look forward to reading more.
4,Great Book for Travellers!,"If you are a traveller, and you want to have a unique experience, this book is for you! It has many great ideas for planning any kind of vacation imaginable, whether it be to work, experience a new culture, or just relax, this book has it all!"
2,Proceed with Caution,"I bought my machine, and am having a lot of problems withthe cd sticking in the middle of a song... the cd's playfine on other machines - am trying to sort this out rightnow but from the rankings, it seems you either get a wonderful one that works perfectly or you get a lemon? High priceto pay if you're the one that gets the lemon?"
4,An amusing tale for parents and children to share together.,"With its clever, repetitive language and colorful illustrations, this has been a book that our family has read and re-read many times."
2,warms ok but it is too large to manipulate easily and pulls your hair,"It is a nice Iron but when u using it, it pulls my hear a lot on the sides of the warming surfaces. IT has black areas on both ends of the warming area, and if hair gets there it will pull it , this can be really annoying. I have to make sure it wont fall in therethere.And one other thing its too long to be easy for regular usage.Rating 2 because it is not what I expected and I am thinking of returning it and buying another one."
5,"Frued 14 "" saw blade review","This blade out preforms most blades in it's field. For the price you can not beat it. Another winner from Frued. Excellent blades where quality counts. thanks again for your quality. Greenhorn Wood Design. Donna Wolfe , President"
4,"It is the bomb, Cox definitely struck a cord in my heart.","When I first heard Cox's voice, he reminded me of Al B. Sure back in the day. But after listening to more, I changed my mind. Cox really has his own style, and I like that. A couple of the jams make your heart pump, and oh what a feeling! He will be one of my favorite singers for some time. Keep up the excellent work Dreaj Music, you guys are on the road to absolute stardom."
3,I thought I was getting a little bit more by buying it..,"The Video is awesome, it's creepy the first time you see it, and then it just starts to get damn cool and damn funny at the same time. I use a wheelchair in real life, so whether this is lame or not... I LOVED THE WHEELCHAIR BREAK DANCING... it looked awesome... I think I was a little bit overtired when I decided to buy it though, because all it really is, is a book with a bunch of twisted up pictures of rubber johnny, and a cd of the 6 minute video that u can see on other places on the internet.. I was HOPIN that the book would have more of an in depth explanation of the video, to see why rubber johnny was created.. seriously... why.. I need analysis in my life!! But Now that I bought it, I still don't regret the purchase, cust it's still a crazy and insane music video, and great to add on to the rest of my collection of creepy and f**ked up things."
2,Too Short!!,"I blinked and it was over. No really, it barely lasts five minutes. It's a segue. It leads you on with its elaborate packaging (lots of pictures that make you question your choice to watch it while eating) and has a disturbing opening which leads you on to the fact that there might be a story here... nope. It's not worth the $10 I paid.Those five minutes were good. Wait for it to show up on some sort of compilation- then buy it."
3,too short~!,"quite brilliant, but much to short to justify the price! its over in the blink of an eye it seems. not even a full song from aphex. i was hoping for new music, but no, its a song from drukqs. recommended, but only if you have the money burning a hole in your pocket."
2,No where near his best work,"After seeing the promos and reading the announcements for this film, I was looking forward to seeing an actual short film by Cunningham. However, ""Rubber Johnny"" turns out to be just another Aphex Twin music video, and in my opinion, the least successful of the ones Cunningham has made. I own both of his other Aphex videos, but I will not be purchasing this one. Try before you buy."
1,"DONT BLINK......OR YOU MIGHT MISS THIS ""MOVIE""!!","WOW!! Chris Cunningham has some dark and twisted videos which I like....but come on man.....a SIX-MINUTE movie. You gotta be kidding me. I've seen videos on MTV longer than this. WARNING:SPOILERBasically, here is the whole movie in a nut-shell. A deformed kid in a wheelchair...bouncing laser beams off of his hands, to some Aphex Twin background music and a few images of what looks like raw chicken pushed up against a pane of glass.This would probably be a cool DVD....if they would've included some special features. Commentary,easter eggs,trailers, something....anything. Instead, it has one option on the menu screen...""play Rubber Johnny.""Whoever marketed or put out this DVD, must be really hurting for money. They could have easily fit this onto the ""Work of Director Chris Cunningham"" DVD, at no additional cost or packaging. Do yourself, and the planet a favor and dont buy this. This is a waste of plastic, and time."
5,"""Simultaneously the scariest and the most hilarious thing you've ever seen""","I stole that line from a fellow Amazonian who was referring to the cover of the Come To Daddy EP (Aphex Twin), but I believe it works equally well in describing the contents of this DVD. To see why it took so long for Chris to make Rubber Johnny, read this interview: (...)"
3,melodic metal,i liked this album better than their funeral album. its a good metal album for people who like a little singing in their metal.
5,In My Opinion....,"...what Sentenced has done over the course of their history together is evolved past that, and molded themselves into something different and unique, and i dont see how its fair that anyone could bastardize this album. now i'll admit i really cant be one to proclaim what is good and bad, but i am entitled to my opinion, and my opinion is simply that Sentenced is a phenominal band; always has been, always will be. they have an excellent drummer (i really dont see how you can look past Vesa Ranta like that), guitarists who kick, and although they may be weak on bass right now, Sami is new, and in time he'll progress. to top it off, Liahla has a great voice that ranges VERY well, and is perfect for this kind of music.anyway, in conclusion, BUY THIS ALBUM. its a great place to start for new fans, and a great addition to the collection of any long time fan...or anyone for that matter."
5,You will not be disappointed,"If you like Sentenced, you will definitely like this album. Usually when I get a CD I'll like a couple songs, but I can listen to the whole album over and over again (which I do at work). A must have in your Sentenced collection. My fave on the album is You Are The One. GET IT NOW!"
4,A hidden gem,"I purchased this game after reading reviews from other people on Amazon and have to say I was thoroughly pleased. You may remember the choose your own adventure books that were popular years ago, this is the same concept and just as much fun. I'd recommend it for anyone who's looking for something a little different from the typical platformers that are so popular on the DS right now."
4,Hotel Dusk,"After you get to a certain point in the game it's hard to figure out what to do next. You just keep doing the same things over and over again and when nothing happening, you get frustrated and put it away. The game is okay if you can get past the 2nd chapter."
3,"Refreshing at first, but then boring","When I starting playing this game I thought that it was pretty cool and new, but actually it's more like a mediocre crime stroy. Your own participation in the game is minimal and all you really do is walk around and look at stuff. There are no real challenges besides finding the right door so the game can proceed. If you make the mistake and put the game down for a week(don't do it)you will find yourself ultra non motivated to play it again!3 stars are for the idea and style of the game."
3,No chapters....,This is the first game I have purchased where there are no chapters meaning that you cannot save your progress. Every time you play you have to start from the beginning and go all the way through the dialogue. I gave it 3 stars because it is fun to play while you are in it.
3,HARD TO FIGURE OUT,THIS GAME COULD BE A GOOD GAME IF IT WERE EASIER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. THE INSTRUCTIONS DON'T GIVE YOU ANY HINTS TO HELP YOU GET UNSTUCK IN CERTAIN AREAS. PLEASE INCLUDE MORE HELPFUL HINTS.
5,Awesome mystery!,"I have nothing bad to say about this game. Good story, multiple endings and long enough to get your money's worth. The replay value on this is very high as well which makes this game a winner"
4,Hotel Dusk,"Awesome game. I never thought I would enjoy what is basically a point-and-click adventure, but the story is what is so absorbing and the plot thickens as you continue. I found myself hooked! I have yet to finish the game, but I really like what I have played so far. Innovative and captivating. Definitely recommend buying this, even if you aren't sure if it is to your taste :)"
4,Great adventure game,"This was a fun adventure game, it really reminded me of the old point-and-click games. The art style is cool too, I'm sure a lot of people will mention Take On Me. There *is* a lot of reading involved, I'd describe this as an interactive detective novel more than anything. But I like reading so it's no biggie.Most of the puzzles make sense, although there were a couple of times it took me a while to find a ""trigger spot"" that makes an event happen.Replay value is maybe not that great. There are 3 different endings as far as I know, but the game was about 15 hours gameplay for me and I don't know that I'd do that all over again to get the different endings.Overall fun game, I hope developers make more of these!"
5,"Scooby Doo, huh?","I say that because, at one point, Louie says that it's, ""just like that show with the talking dog and the guy who's hungry all the time!"" I've always been a fan of a good mystery, which is what this is. I wish it were longer, and a bit more challenging, but it was still quite the game. Probably the best DS game I've played, which amounts to about 15."
3,"It's a Nintendo DS Book, Not a Game","This game isn't my cup of tea. I wanted to love it, but was disappointed in the end. I didn't even finish the game.I love puzzle/adventure games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. I thought this game was in the genre, but I was mistaken. There's too much dialogue and not enough puzzle solving. You find yourself in conversations that go on and on. If I wanted to read this much I'd pick up a book. At least there could be an option to skip some of the dialogue.If you're patient enough to sit through long in-game dialogue, then you might like this game. If you want an equal amount of dialogue and puzzle solving, then this game isn't for you."
4,Great Mystery Game,I like this game. It's a good game but the dialogue kinds of run long. Other than that its a intersting mystery that is just waiting to be unraveled.
5,Excellent,The game was amazing! I was hooked the entire way through! It is always interesting and it was an innovative way to play such a game - to make your own choices. Some of the dialogue lasted awhile though and you have to wait until it's over to save the game but otherwise it was awesome!
2,Rather boring.,i was hoping for some more but it was a let down! The chats can drag on between people and so on.
2,"Not only boring, Hotel Dusk is incoherent.","I leked the idea of this game a lot, but the execution is terrible. There are almost know options or challenges, much if this game is just walking around touching anything and everything until something happens. The story is completely linear, so even if you go somewhere and do something, like search a laundry cart, you get a different results at different times. This makes it confusing and frustrating. There is no way I could have even ever gotten through this game with out internet walkthrough guides. One time I walked around for like two hours and could not get anyhting to happen. I read the walkthrough and found I was supposed to go find hidden items that were out of view and not there the first time I looked because the story was not there yet. It just seems dumb. One of the puzzles you win by closing the DS and opening it. How in the heck are you supposed to guess that. This game is just strange, wierd, boring and does not make sense."
2,not for me,"I like the idea of this type of game on the DS, I spent many hours on adventure games on the PC in the 90s. But most of the time on this game you are clicking to go thru the dialogue, there are some puzzle solving involved, but they are pretty simple. Also a lot of the time you need to go to random places to advance the story, example (SPOILER ALERT) at ch 3 you know you are supposed to return a doll to the little girl, but when you go to her room the door doesn't open, well that's because you are supposed to solve this other unrelated puzzle first (the fountain pen) to advance the story, THEN you can go talk to the girl, which makes absolutely no sense. I am at chapter 4 and think I'm done."
2,S-L-O-W by today's standards,"Boring. I bought this game because it seemed neat that it was a myster story and you had to hold it like a book. Oh, boy is it like a book! If you like comic book mysteries you might enjoy this more than I did. It just takes so long to get to the point. Talking and talking.... and talking-- and you have to press the darned button after ever sentence! I'm used to Adventure of Zelda-- this just plods along, no real action, the most suspense is when you pass someone in the hallway. The ONLY reason I'm still trying to play it is out of pride-- and I paid [...]for it."
2,Sadly disappointing,"As a very 'old' gamer of 47, I'm an old hand at point and click games. This game, being new, is incredibly disappointing. The conversations between characters go on forever for no particular reason and actual game play is few and far between. The graphics stink. I was hoping for much more based on previous reviews, but was very let down. Hopefully, future DS games will approach this game genre again, but do a better job of it."
3,Good Story,This was the first game of its type that I've played (I started with the Professor Layton series) and I enjoyed it. The story held my interest although I was hoping for more puzzles. The mini games were simply distractions and didn't really add to the plot line. This truly is more like an interactive mystery story - fun to read just not really a game.
4,keeps you interested,WARNING this is a text heavy game be ready to read alot of dialogue between characters. But the mystery novel story line insterested me and solving clues with the touch screan was cool. Not much replay though.
4,Slow paced but not bad,Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is slow paced due to all the (sometimes unnecessarily long) conversations that take place but overall the storyline is interesting. I was originally expecting the game to be more involved but the formula is fairly simple if you have patience and attention to detail. I like the way the plot unfolds and definitely think the game is worth playing.
1,Disappointing,"I had heard such great reviews about this game, but it was terrible! There was coarse language throughout and the gameplay was terrible. It is full of dialogue to click through, simple puzzles that use no brains at all to complete, and confusing storyline that leaves you wondering where on earth to go next. Terrible game!"
1,Fun as watching grass grow.,"This game is boring, stupid, not fun, poor controls and the characters are not interesting. If your a mystery fan, get MYST, or anything other than this. The only mystery here is why this game was made and who would have the time to waste on it."
4,Sacred's great,"I always visit Amazon looking for new music and discovered the Taliesin Orchestra when their Thread Of Time CD was on a top sellers list in the independent music area. I bought that CD on a whim and wasn't disappointed. When I saw they had this new album, Sacred, I had to see if they could make a good album two times in a row. Well, they didn't let me down. Come to find out, this ones different from some of their other stuff becuz they usually do remakes of Enya's stuff, but this one is interpretations of some of my favorite music ever and they do really good with it. I recommend Sacred for music to just listen to or put in the background while at work or somehting else. That's all, just thought I'd share my thoughts."
5,Fantastic listen for New Age,"This CD is a great listen for those of us who like choral and new Age. WARNING, it does contain religious content. Well given the name DUH but I was surprised by that but I sing classical music which is mostly religious so not a problem. As a chorus guy I loved this CD and still listen to it in the kitchen when cooking."
5,LOVE these!,"I've been looking for these everywhere and when I had no luck finding them in various stores, I came straight to Amazon! These are great. I use two of them for my cooking needs and the other two I actually use as travel bowls for my dog!"
3,nice bowls but lids do not fit well,"these bowls are a great size for snacks, etc. however, the lids do not close ""tightly"" at all. the lids do not create a seal of any kind so when traveling i will never put any food inside that is liquidy. the quality of the bowls is very good."
2,Misleading,These bowls are much smaller than they appear. They are good for little more than holding/serving sauces. Don't be fooled by the picture. It is misleading.
2,Smaller Than Expected,"I suppose I should have done my homework more thoroughly, but to those like myself, be warned that these are appropriate for holding a spice mix, some chopped onion or garlic, or other additives, but not prime food portions. They are roughly four inches across, max. I am returning mine which is made easy by Amazon,(Thank You Amazon) and re-ordering some larger prep bowls."
4,Good product but unable to use for original purpose,"I bought these bowls for my 1 1/2 year old so he wouldn't always have to eat from plastic. I especially wanted to use them at his daycare as they heat up the food in plastic containers (so I imagine there's some transfer of chemicals to his food). However, the lids are not tight so food leaks out if it's not kept vertical and - a problem with any stainless bowl - the bowl would get very hot while the food inside was still tepid or even cold. So we had to go back to using plastic at daycare but I do use them all the time for him at home since I can heat up food in another dish and transfer it to one of these bowls for him. And he has thrown them on the floor - no dents on the bowls though, they are very sturdy."
4,Great,"I use these at work for lunch & snacks , they are perfect 1 cup bowls that don't leak & clean up easy."
4,Halifax Disaster and the Aftermath,"The City of Halifax in Nova Scotia on December 6, 1917, was beginning a routine morning of business openingsand school lessons. The peace of the day was shattered by an explosion as one ship (the IMO) struck another(the Mont Blanc) in the Narrows of Halifax Harbor. The Mont Blanc was carrying explosives, including TNT, butwas not marked with any sign indicating the danger.In 62 pages, Ernest Fraser Robinson captures the horrors of that day and the subsequent attemptsat rescue and assistance. Contemporary photographs demonstrate, as words could not, the suffering ofthose injured, homes destroyed, families torn apart. There were acts of heroism also as recountedin the narrative.Robinson is Canadian born, a retired teacher, living on Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Hispublication is a dramatic and valuable account of the worst civilian disaster prior to Hiroshima."
2,content fantastic; presentation wanting,"Robert Kennedy's speeches continue to be highly relevant today. Unfortunately, this product's excerpts are unnecessarily short, with very uneven, and poor, sound quality. A disappointment, as a result."
1,"Would rate it a ""0"" if I could..","I could not wait to get these home as I suffer from severe heel pain due to plantar fasciatis and little fat on my heels. At first it felt a little better but that did not last long. First, it takes up room in your shoe. It pushed my foot forward and now made my shoe feel too small. My big toe was squished. I could feel the edges of the insert, even thought they were the correct size. Is there a Right/Left. Don't know! So I switched them around in my shoes but the results were the same. PAIN PAIN PAIN. I used them for about a week until I couldn't take it anymore. My friend got a similar pair in Sports Authority and loves them for less than half the price. I think I will try those. I can not recommend these at all."
1,Useless unless you can glue it in place,"Within 50 steps these heel cups rotate 90 degrees and become very uncomfortable in the shoe. I don't know about you, but I don't have time to keep taking off my shoes at work and realigning them."
5,Heal those heels,My podiatrist recommended these for heel spurs. I love them. I got a great price and super fast shipping through Amazon. If you have heel pain...try these.Theresa D.Chicago
3,"pain relief, maybe ?",This provides relief but you have to combine it with strech excersizes. I am a little dissappointed that it has already started to crack. I purchased a similar item in the shoe store locally and it seems to hold up better and work just as well.
2,Lasted * months!!!,only made it 8 months... I was Thought it would last longer. Would not buy again. Good luck with this company. thanks
4,"his ""citizens"" are NOT sheep","The events of 9-11 hurt the sales of this book. However subsequent policy panic make this work MORE important, not less.This is a true sequel, not a ""stand alone"". If you enjoyed ""The Probability Broach"", read this one."
5,Great sequal!,If you are like me you find a good series but you catch a book in the middle and nothing makes sense. This is not that book. If for some reason you read this book first there is enough backstory filled in that it all makes sense.
4,Is beyond Medieval,"This book is not a light read. It is an intense work on the topic of ancient horse breeding. By intense, I mean that you'd best photocopy the map on the end papers so that you can reference the ancient placenames that are referenced throughout this work to reduce page flipping.The information is good and the sources that are referenced are primarily Eastern in origin.It is recommended for any historically minded horse enthusiast's library."
3,Disappointed,I expected the maps inside this book to be in color. I wish I had known that they were not.
4,Excellent Reference,"If you are a beginner or have some experience in calligraphy, I would recommend this book. Excellent overall reference."
3,generally valuable resource,"For anyone who desires to know about the mechanics and history of calligraphy, this book will prove valuable. However, its abundance of text may be daunting to beginning calligraphers, who desire more simple instruction. Advanced calligraphers may learn new techniques, but I would only recommend this volume to those who are willing to sift through superfluous information."
4,Surrogacy Was the Way,"A riveting topic to anyone who has suffered from infertility or loved someone who does. Format very conducive to the various paths that lead a couple to surrogacy. Despite poor editing/proofreading, I highly recommend this book."
5,Great book,"This is a great book, that shares the reality of surrogacy. A must read for anyone considering surrogacy!"
2,Redundant,"I found this book to repeat information over and over while some sections were weak and missed important details. Once I read it I realized that it could have been narrowed down to about 75 pages of valuable information. Also, it has been more difficult to put the author's suggestions into practice, especially since there are no recommendations about where to buy good quality ayervedic herbs. The author also has a section about vitamins and suggests that the readers e-mail him and ask questions about the absorption rates of the vitamins they give their children. I sent him an e-mail a few months ago, and unfortunately, did not get a response. There are other books on this topic that are more comprehensive."
2,"I'm Sorry, This just didn't work for me.","I really wanted to like this, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I enjoyed the music, but the visuals really weren't all that interesting. I found the images to be too soft, almost to the point of being fuzzy. Sorry, I just can't recommend this."
3,Not as authentic-appearing as I'd hoped,"This DVD is OK...glad I didn't pay three times as much directly from Gaiam, though! Not nearly has ""borealis-y"" as I'd hoped. Disappointed that the inside was cracked, although the DVD plays fine."
4,Very Entertaining,"This game was the second game I bought for my Game Boy Color. It is great!The graphics are very good, especially for the Game Boy Color platform, and it even includes wide-screen shots from the movie in the introduction.The reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that you can't save your progress, and because of the low number of levels. The only way that you can save your place is when you beat a level, and even then, you have to write down a code and enter it next time to get to the same spot, which is tedious. Also, there are only 10 levels, so it goes by pretty fast.Other than those things, I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and think that you will too!"
4,Good game but...,"This game is really good now don't get me wrong but, while in some places you have to hit everything with the lightsaber to find a passageway, you have to read alllllll of the instructions to play, and the codes are to long."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I bought this game anticipating a true Star Wars adventure. But I guess it was sort of like the movie, boring. Sure, the fun part is getting to use the lightsaber and the force, but it get's a little boring fighting droids all the time. The levels aren't that difficult either. I made it through five in less than an hour, and there are only nine levels total! When I got to fight the Sith, in the final level, I was surprised at how easy it was, given you can go recharge yourself if you run out of energy points. Overall, I was looking for more of a challenging game and it proved to be a little boring. Graphics are pretty cool and so is sword play and sound effects. But there needed to be more levels and it would have been nice to fight people instead of machines. Waiting for a better game from Lucas arts--and a better movie!"
2,Technical note on the MP3 version,"As the CD is out of print (and used copies ridiculously over-priced) I thought I would download the MP3 version. Beware: there are slight fade in/outs on every track & since most of the tracks don't have a clean break it becomes a bit annoying. Amazon was kind enough to refund my money- still a bit of a let down. Ah well.As to the performance: Fricsay leads a nice middle of the road interpretation. No breakneck speeds, nothing quirky. The singers are having one heck of of a time; rolling rrs, smirks in the voice, almost hammy (in a good way), but they have enough sense to let the pathos come through at the right moments. The sound is typical late 50s-60s DG. Bright, boxy & kinda soft in the bass. If this review were of the recording alone I'd gladly give it 4 stars."
1,Horrible!!,"If you want something that is going to fall apart the minute you get it, then this is it. Horrible constuction, looks cute, but not at all functional!"
4,Functional,"It does as it is intended to do, it measures spark output... We got to use this right after giving it to my Dad at christmas.... My car wouldn't start again there was no spark....boom one ignition coil later we are back in business.... :)"
5,Gospel Hymns / Bluegrass never sounded so good!,"This is a collection of hymns played with traditional Bluegrass instruments. You won't recognize them as hymns so much as just good music.Very pleasant to listen to, relaxing, and brings back fond memories of church.If they played more Bluegrass like this, I'd buy much more, and if they played this music in church, I'd go more often.Very well done."
5,'Set Aside' money for this CD!,"Nuclear Saturday f-n rocks. Vast improvement since I am Jon Stone. Also, check out nuclear saturday's ex-guitarist's band 'Under the Weather' (formerly Sloppy Meateaters)"
1,JUST A LOT OF NOISE,"IF YOU WANT TO BREAK YOUR LEASE THIS IS THE CD TO PLAY LOUD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES MUSIC GO ELSEWHERE. I DON'T MIND NOISE-ROCK WHEN THEIR IS A SEMBLENCE OF RIFF OR MELODY{SONIC YOUTH, BIG BLACK, DON CABALLERO}, BUT THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF PLASTIC. I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER FROM THESE MUSICIANS."
1,Remastering wrecks a great album,"Save your money.I unfortunately purchased this CD a week ago, as my original copy went missing after a recent move. This listing is actually for the ""remastered"" version of Sacrifist. Not only is the packaging somewhat blurred on the back, but the disc itself basically looks like it was shat out of a home PC.Worst of all, the music won't play on any of my equipment: Car stereo or home stereo. It just skips all over.Again, this 2006 edition is not entirely the original version that released in 1994. The ""remastered"" version was not supervised by Bill Laswell. The track listing is identical to the first release, but the CD may not play well on your equipment.For the record, I love this album. The single star does not reflect the quality of the music, just of the release itself."
2,Dabbles in deranged,"2 1/2These are little more then artsy and/or masochist experimentations, but I suppose it is a small niche filled well for those heavily invested in the genre. Credit an eclectic arsenal on the production front for sounds not becoming repetitive and meanderings less pretentious. It sounds like early schiz-rock with maybe a little more accessibility from the straight-ahead metal influence mixed in with broader appealing elements, but does not reach near the heights of madness many others have."
4,Better than I could have ever imagined,"This was my first exposure to Praxis. based on the insanity of this release I picked up Transmutation and metatron and wondered why people had reviewed Transmutation so highly. It doesnt even sound like the same band. This album's individual members contributions are easily identifiable with ZOrn mixing it up almost as much as he did for Mr. Bungles' self-entitled release.To be honest, Ive heard other Praxis releases and they are all easily missed, whereas this one is a must have. If I had to pick 10 albums to be stranded on a desert island with, this one would definitely be with me."
3,Get a Sony!,"Probably good for simple setups but if ya want something thatis completely customizable, and can learn different codes, get thesony touchscreen remote. It controls up to 12 different components on a wonderful backlit touchscreen display. Much better value than Philips remote..."
4,Great Enough!,"Almost perfect. Love the feature that allows me to turn all equiment on/off with the action+power click (kinda like a shift key). Worked with all my stuff (RCA TV, Sony VCR, Sony DVD, Technics Surround Sound Tuner, and Technics CD), however, remote won't tell tuner to select VCR2 input. Still, allowed me to shelve 4 remotes. I'd buy it again."
2,photographer,"Extremely dissapointed. Product very incomplete, so as to render it nearly useless. Author tried, but not very hard. Would not reccomend this guide to anyone."
4,Fungi Fun!!!,"I have been wanting to learn more about mushrooms that are so abundant here after the August rains,and I really have enjoyed leafing thru this book to become better informed for next summer! Fun, and informative!"
4,Excellent book on time-dependent behavior of clouds.,Good physical and mathematical description of the temporal behavior of all forms and types of clouds. Written at graduate level. Covers all aspects of cloud dynamics including fundamentals of atmospheric dynamics. Details of particular cloud classes from met viewpoint including measurements. Emphasis on measurements to support modeling.
5,"A brief, simple how-to guide for readers of all ages and all walks of life","How To Help A Grieving Friend: A Candid Guide for Those Who Care is a straightforward, simple guide to help Christian readers to become a source of comfort and strength to their friends, family, and fellow parishoners recovering from terrible loss. Divided into short poems ""How To Help"" and longer prose sections ""How It Feels"", How To Help A Grieving Friend succinctly describes tested strategies to be of assistance. A brief, simple how-to guide for readers of all ages and all walks of life. ""Invite me to sit with you / Church is one of the hardest places to be. / Sitting alone in that pew is devastating. / All the expressions of care are overwhelming. / Shelter me. / Let me hide out next to you."""
4,How about Region 1?,I saw this concert when I was a kid. It was awesome & wanted the video but it was out of print. This has the videos too. I also had to return it!I am P**sed Off!!!!!! How can we get it here?
5,Family gathering or traveling music - You'll love it!,"My wife and I bought this CD at a Cracker Barrel Restaurant a few years ago. (We're not country music buffs per se, but we do enjoy some of today's popular country music.) ""Old Time Gathering"" is great to launch a long ride to visit Grandma or go on vacation. We played it in the background during Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner and it gave everybody a really warm feeling. If you like strings and hammered dulcimer you'll want this CD and you'll guard it carefully. I took mine to the dentist to play over their sound system during a root canal. When they finished with me, the staff gave me money and asked me to bring them one next visit!"
4,Good for the basics,"I don't have a long background in Judo or video instruction, but I find it to be fairly weak in production value. The basics are covered okay."
4,a forgotten rocker...who rocked..!,"ok..so Tommy was a little nuts....but this album has some real gems from the old sun studio...the disk is well worth it just to hear the guitar of the ultra wild CARL ADAMS..!!..great liner notes too,,!!!..this cd is a hidden jewel of early rock and rockabilly..!!"
3,"Thoughtful, but not conclusive","I would label this as under most mysticism, the finger pointing at the moon is not the moon. This science is pointing towards god, but is not nor proves god. Its a tool for understanding.I've heard Peter Russel speak on this topic and he is quite amazing at synthesizing scientific knowledge and mystical knowledge. Call from knosis to gnosis. This books isn't as convincing as he is in person."
4,A book for our time,"In this era when people begin to ask questions and take responsibility for their life, it is time to enreach one self with wider understanding about what it is all about out there. Nothing is clear and clean cut."
5,From complexity to sublime simplicity,A beautiful book! It is little in size but big in content. Peter Russell has graced us with the story of his own journey from common-sense atheistic scientist to one who has Awakened. Along the way he builds a fascinating bridge between the developing theories of science and the inner mysteries of consciousness itself. The theme is not new but then this story is always new when it unfolds itself again in you. This is indeed the ultimate meaning and purpose of life; the discovery that your own self is non-other than the wondrous Self of all. That your deepest being is already one with the light and energy which ever creates and sustains the universe. This is a very timely and wise and well written book. Don't miss it!
3,Nice Taggies product/ Really small,"It's adorable, durable, and it squeaks. It's also smaller than an adult hand, so just don't be expecting anything grand."
1,thumbs down... way too basic,"Although Lancaster's book may have been appropriate 10 years ago, it's old stuff now. He is either padding pages or doesn't know what to write... Half the book is data-sheet briefs which can be found in any decent data book.I expected clever circuits using c-mos components... intstead I got mostly fluff with a few suggestions. I do not suggest this book to any but the extreme novice."
5,Read this book or you'll be sorry.,"If you're interested in digital design, this book is a must-read.In very little time, you will gain an intuitive feel for digital hardware design, and understand how to design useful circuits.I first read this book in high school, about 20 years ago.Since then, I completed an EE degree at Cornell, and have practiced as an engineer.Nothing I ever read was a useful as this book, and I still regularly refer to it."
5,Practical digital circuit design,"This CMOS Cookbook provides circuit design information using cmos ICs. It provides schematic diagrams, detailed specifications relating to the broad family of CMOS ICs. It includes a practical design and application course as well as a detailed proven design reference manual."
5,Simple and fun.,"I was fortunate enough to have this game included in my Kings Quest Collection. I finished it in one day and still continue to play it every once and a while. It's got some pretty funny stuff in it, from the lesbian flapper in the Ladies' room to the rude taxi driver you meet during evening hours. The police chief is quite a character too. The only thing I didn't like about it was that during Act 6, if you didn't get every answer right, you end up murdered. Still, no matter how old it gets, it'll always remain a favorite."
5,i love it.,"great variety,and music from many masters of the art. hope anyone who love jazz can take advantage of this great collection."
1,Item does not match description.,"This item is incorrectly described as a ""Freud F412 Premier Fusion 12-Inch 40 Tooth ATB General Purpose Saw Blade with 1-Inch Arbor and PermaShield Coating"".Freud's number for the 12-inch Premier Fusion is P412 and it is a newly available item. The blade mentioned in this description and shown in the picture is an older discontinued F412 Premier, not the new P412 Premier Fusion."
2,Wish I'd read the reviews before buying it. . .,". . . because the three negative reviews below reflect my own judgment as well. Fortunately, I didn't pay full price. I bought the book at a used book store, hoping for a useful guide to sci-fi flicks that I should try to catch when they appear late nights on T.V. But I soon found that many of Henderson's opinions were just the opposite of mine. For instance, he pans movies like Terminator 2 and Aliens, while praising Alien 3, Battle Beyond the Stars, and Tri-Star's Godzilla (failing, by his own admission, to comprehend why Godzilla fans didn't like it). And, as noted by the others below, his criticisms often seemed inconsistent, praising a quality in one film (such as its campiness) that he criticized in another.Of course, that his opinions were different than mine doesn't mean they were wrong. But I soon decided that for me, at least, this was not the guide I was looking for."
2,Very disappointed,"The author of this book takes a smug, superior attitude in his reviews, that I found very off-putting. I should have known I was in trouble when, early in his introduction, he says his basic premise is that 90% of everything is garbage. He then proceeds to demonstrate that view in his reviews. And, despite his know-it-all attitude, I spotted several errors of fact in various reviews, for example, his referring to the Gene Barry character in War of the Worlds as Dr. ""Clayton"", as though Clayton were the character's last name. This may seem like a small item, but the author himself continually nitpicks the movies he is reviewing, so turn-about is fair play. I would give the book one star, except for a few insights I found. However, I decided the book was not worth keeping as a reference, and have already disposed of it at a used bookstore."
3,TOO SHORT!,"Almost like ""Rock Guitar Method: with CD"": the book is simple to understand, the songs are nice. But the problem remains the same: there are too few exercises and songs!!!"
2,there are other cameras out there better than this,"First of all I understand that a digital camera under 30 dollars is not going to give you high quality pics. I assure you this camera indeed does not take very good pics, the pics are somewhat blurry, not crisp at all. I bought a cheapo camera attachment for my pda a while back that took pictures of simalar quality.Although this camera might be usefull for taking pics of items youre putting on Ebay or maybe of houses if youre a real estate agent and don't need big quality pics, you can do better. There are cameras out there the size of a credit card that takes pics that are no worse than the ones this one takes. Shop around for a smaller camera if picture quality is not of tremendous importance."
1,Digital junk,I thoguht this little camera was going to be great for the price but i was wrong. This camera can shoot a picture straight as you see it in the little view window because when i uploaded the picture the object i captured was to the right of the pic when i snapped a photo looking straight at it dead center of the view. so for the price you pay it's nothing but junk
5,Great!,"Bought these for a batch of birthday cupcakes. Arrived all in tact, not broken. Arrived quickly. Looked great on our cupcakes!"
4,Cute George Accessories,I ordered these to use as party favors for my son's second birthday. They're cute and will make perfect favors for the kids!
1,Not what I was expecting.,This item is described as cupcake rings which is suggestive of them being ring to go around the cupcake not party favor rings to go on top of the cupcake. Highly disappointed if it wasn't such a hassle I would def. send them back. Before you advertise a product it should be clear on what the product actually is. Really bad advertising.
5,"Extremely enlightening book, heartwrenching","This book was excellent. I have read books related to war, but this was well written, making me feel like I was there in the battle. I may be prejudice, since I worked with the author for a few years. A very good man. May his future be as bright as his book is enlightening"
1,Serious doubts,"I too have serious doubts about the events in this book. This does not sound like the Corps I was in, the events are universally gradiosing, no eyewitnesses are offered, no documentation or supporting data is offered, and there is some jargon that doesn't fit. Anyone who reads this book should also read Stolen Valor by BG Burkett to understand how to critically review this and any other military book."
1,So many glaring errors of fact...hard to believe,"Having served 32 years in the Marine Corps I was amazed at the massive amount of things in this book that are just not true. Because of this, it casts serious doubt on the remainder of what the author has written. The author titles his book ""CAP Mot: The story of a Marine Special Forces Unit in Vietnam"". CAP was never a ""Special Forces"" unit. I was in CAP myself and know of whence I speak. Possibly the author, who admittedly states that almost everything comes from his memory, recalls CAP in the fashion that it is written. However, for those who are interested in serious scholarship of the subject, I would recommend they go elsewhere. This might better be placed in the fiction section of libraries."
4,"A Marine's Tale of What Was, And What Could Have Been","This is an excellent book for a number of reasons. First, it is a poignant and heart-wrenching memoir of a young Marine in Vietnam. The lucid voice of a sensitive and thoughtful warrior reverberates throughout the text. Secondly, this book covers a little known aspect of the war: The Marine Corps Combined Action Platoons (CAP). Goodson gives an excellent account of his unit's objectives and operations. It is one of the few books that gives a sense of what the war was like where it was really fought - at the village level. Moreover, this book shows what could have been if only the high command had fought a true counter-insurgency campaign. One cannot help but feel that Goodson's small squad achieved more than whole battallions of regular troops. This book is a must for those who truly wish to understand the war. And for any military history buff, it is a war memoir of an exceptional caliber."
5,New Item,Scotts Ortho Weed B Gon was recommended by our agricultural extension agent in an effort to find a product that would work without a great deal of contamination. It works and I am satisfied with the results.
1,"dvd recorder, vcr combo","in all the information about this product on amazon, it says dvd recorder,vcr combo. i had a hard time finding the vcr part on this this product. as i can see the vcr combo part has been eliminated now. i returned the product, because it was wasn't was it said it is."
1,Didn't even get the Item,I ordered this item and never received it. I am very disappointed to say the least. Now I am told the item is no longer available. All in all a sad experience.
4,GOOD QUALITY,I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THIS SAW. IT HAS LOW VIBRATION AND GREAT WORK SUPPORT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"I bought this hoping I could get the best of both worlds: a great toy for my son to look at and a mirror that would let me see him when I am driving. Well, the first part was right, it's a cute frog. Problem is the mirror is flimsy and really not of good quality. It's distorted and really cheaply made. Buy the Eddie Bauer mirror, it's a better buy."
1,Should've listened to the negative reviews...,"I guess I learned my lesson. I read the reviews of this product, and was unsure, but I bought it anyway. A waste of money for me. Maybe my son was too old for it to begin with, but they have to be old/big enough to reach the kick pad, so what age is this meant for? Didn't stay in place, held no interest for my son. We're back to the better quality mirror without any kicking gimmicks and I've found other ways to entertain my son in the car. A total waste of my money this time..."
3,Frog Mirror,"This was really cute, however, the person I bought it for had a hard time putting it in her car. It was hard to line up the mirror on the frog and the rear view mirror in the car, so she can see the baby in the back seat.However, she didn't have seats with a neck rest on them in the back, so maybe that is why it was so difficult. Anyway, it's really cute and I think my great niece will enjoy it."
5,Worked for us.,"I can now see our baby in the back seat and she loves playing with it. It required help to get the view just right from my rear view but even with the baby kicking at it, it stays in place."
4,So much fun!,"Our baby LOVES playing with this froggy when she's in her car seat! The little frog flippers to kick are in the perfect location for her little feet, and it's a super cute, colorful toy. No, the mirror reflection isn't perfect quality (the only reason I didn't give this all of the stars), but it's unbreakable and safe, and good enough for me to see what's going on back there. Overall, a very fun, safe diversion for my baby while she's in her car seat."
3,No good as mirror...,...debatable about a toy too. My 6 mo old doesn't seem into it and the mirror is absolutely pointless... (sigh) I so wanted a fun toxin free toy for the car - maybe he'll like it when he's older and I'll update then.I gave it 3 stars because of quality and PVC free.
2,silverado door handle covers,the passenger side lacks a keyhole so i never installed them because i dont have power locks and need the keyhole. would be great if my truck had power locks so i didnt need a pass side keyhole. blah!!
4,a nice catchable book,"a nice well written easy to comprehend book there are better ones of coure , but i guess it's worth trying if you have the time and easy books can help you at the beginning of your programming career. recomended."
1,obsolete and irrelevant,"The book is practically unusable for its stated purpose. It is hopelessly outdated (most suggestions would have been wrong even in 1983). Even the logic of many suggestions is suspect: author often repeats statement ""don't become a refugee"", but also recommends not to fight, but escape instead. Not only that, but he states, that caches are inadequate for longer term life support and suggests to concentrate supplies in the retreat. He advocates bugging in for big city dwellers and recommends to use middle floors in high rises for retreats etc. etc. The only remotely useful suggestions are about dealing with those retreaters, who are reluctant to shoot the attackers. The foundation of most of the suggestions is the author's experience in Africa in 1967, the PLO's methods in Beirut and such. Unbelievable."
3,good but outdated,"This book has some pros ,the experiences of the author shows he knows what he's talkin' about,it has some good ideas and suggetstions,but alot of the info is outdated at this point and some of his stories don't really translate to a disaster in averageville, usa."
4,Useful and entertaining,"Small, easy to read book covering everything you need to know to set up a retreat. At the time it was written, the danger of nuclear war was considered a significant risk which strongly influenced the author's presentation. Many of his points are discussed with entertaining anecdotes, supposedly from his experience.The most important advice in the book are four points he gives in the introduction and repeats at appropriate times throughout the book.First, don't make a target of yourself. Second, no matter how prepared, you cannot effectively fight professional soldiers. Third, which he emphasizes the most in the text, don't ever become a refugee. And last, never give up your ability or desire to resist."
5,Very informative!,Need to know about retreats and survival living? Concerned about the decay of society and the safety of your family? This is one of the best books on the subject... Harden your existing home or build from scratch.
3,Good start,"Ragnar Benson has great ideas, but this book was published in the 80's. The best book i've found yet on the subject is ""How to survive the end of the world as we know it"" By James Wesley Rawles. It talks very thoroughly about every aspect on how to survive a grid down situation. A great companion is the book Patriots, which further discusses certain ""processes"" which cannot be found in that book. Good Luck!"
2,Save your money,"Who in thier right mind tells you to stockpile gynasmite? very limited use info here, several points that make you think but i belive most would benefit more from a more common sense approach"
1,[inexpensive] & Poor Quality too.,"This phone is [inexpensive] to buy, but we found that its sending audio quality was poor and faded in and out. The wall mount brack is very large and clumsy looking. If you want a 2.4 Ghz DSS phone, spend the extra money. You'll be happier."
2,Rada Cutlery,"The knife's are very sharp, cuts threw a steak like butter! Only bad thing is i put them in the dishwasher and thehandles turned dark! Now they don't look that nice anymore!"
4,One of the best paring knives I have used.,"My only complaint about about this product is the exorbitant amount of postage charged to ship it. Considering that this is a small, lightweight product which was shipped in a padded envelope, I think over $10 is ridiculous. I would not do this again!"
1,Not a good book at all,"The book lacks to too many explanations, and universities shouldn't use it for classes at all unless the proffessors are planning to use it for assigning problems only.Unfortunatly the book has less than 13-20 examples in all of its ~500 pages, which is the worst thing you can do to for a physics student who is just trying to learn the material in an advanced way after General physics.The book has no advanced concepts to say its not meant for introductory, so in both cases the book is not an introductory nor advanced.If you are looking for a better book in a little advanced concepts (( after General physics)) as modern physics then don't waste time looking for a good book if there is an excellent book written by Rohlf its an excellent second year I've ever read -Modern Physics from aá to Z0-James William Rohlf-ISBN: 0-471-57270-5"
1,I wish i could give it less than 1 star,"This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever tried to use for a class in my life. I was required to purchase this book for my Engineering Physics class at Texas A&M. By the way, Dr. Adair, co author, is a prof here (must be why its required) so I think Ill stay anonymous :). It is complete drivel written in a language that only a person with a doctorate in physics could understand. Its full of flaws, and has absolutely no example problems worked out. After having used this book I have no coice but to assume the authors were trying to keep this stuff a secret. I relied primarially on notes and used it only for homework problems assigned."
3,"Fun toy, not so durable","This toy is durable enough to use it for a rocket, but if you have a boy who wants to keep them in his room and then use them to throw at his little brother and goof off with them, they they break apart. The tips fell off within a few days. The rocket launcher was great, and they did fly as high was it says, however after a few days of playing around with them the tips which were glued on to the foam came off. So keep them away when your child isn't using them."
3,Customer Service Issue,"The Anthony's Astringent aftershave is great. Ordered it multiple times. This time the shipper sent the wrong item. I then had to inquire and received no response via the Amazon ""contact the shipper"" link for several days. Had to look up the company on the net and contact them directly at which time they emailed me and advised they did not have the item I ordered in stock and could they ship multiple small size bottles to equal the size ordered. I consented, it was sent and arrived. It was what it was...could have been better."
2,Confused,"It was a good book I guess, but not enough info on growing tomatoes. There was no diagrams or pictures at all! I did purchase a used book, and was very happy with the condition of it, almost new!"
2,Disappointed,"I love Gary's website tomatofest.com. It has the most interesting varieties of tomatos that you will find any where. I have ordered many, many tomato seeds from his website. I was excited to find his book as I thought for sure he would have included some really great tomato growing secrets. Unfortunately, one or two pages were dedicated to soil and trellising. I was so disappointed. Fortunately, the book contains great information on tomato varieties and beautiful pictures. Oh, well. Maybe his next book will include his secrets on growing tomatos."
3,wish i read reviews before buying,"I was very excited to receive my jensen remote control. It was pretty easy to program, nice backlighting. But could not get it to work with my denon avr900, which rendered it useless to me. So sad, I sent it back to amazon, which very kindly paid the shipping. I am still looking for a good remote for around the same price. The search continues....."
2,"Why, Jensen, why?","This just goes to show you that even a little research pays off. This remote looks very nice and is backlit, but it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing. It wouldn't work for my Denon AVR-3300 ( a very popular receiver) or my Sony MiniDisc deck or my Apex DVD player. Jensen support consists of a message board where everyone wants to know why the remote won't control anything. I came across a great site called RemoteCentral and there was a HUGE thread of users of the RadioShack 15-1994. Controls all my stuff and the code and internet support is very good. And it has macros! Backlit too! Only controls six devices though. But if you can get this remote to control that many you are lucky."
3,Not useful for DVD Player,"Ergonomics is slightly awkward. My wife thought it was too unwieldy for smaller hands. The channel +/- buttons have to be very firmly pressed. Although the backlit keys are nice, they make a distinct high pitched hum everytime you press a button and for the two seconds the lights remain on. Jensen replied that is ""normal for (their) backlit remotes controls.""However, the biggest problem that i have with this is that it has no ""Enter"" key equivalent for dvd menus which to me makes it totally useless for dvd control. On the other hand, the Jensen tech support is pretty good."
3,Be careful !,"I bought it, and it worked well with my Panasonic VCR, Sony DVD, Sony TV and RCA Satellite System, but it doesn't support my AIWA A/V Receiver, which means that I lost my money, because I still need the Receiver's original R.C. to control the volume and the sound system functions..."
3,Not for DVD players,"I agree w/the previous review - the remote does not operate the menus on my Toshiba or Pioneer DVD player. You'll get play, rew, for, pause, on/off, maybe subtitles and precious few other one button functions - same as cheaper remotes.VCR and TV functions are covered well (both Toshibas). You can actually program your VCR w/it unlike some of the other cheap remotes. PIP too.The 590's got big backlit buttons , but the layout isn't the greatest and the buttons don't always register even when pressing hard. Backlighting isn't as great a feature as I thought - sometimes you hit the wrong button just to get it to flash and then it flashes too briefly as you're racing to find the right button. Forget using it in a darkened room.A Very basic remote. Cheaper ones do the same for DVD and receivers (Onkyo).Better than average for VCR and TV. Backlighting more of a gimmick than feature."
2,Receiver problems,"Had a universal that controlled the basics of my system, but wanted one that could do more with my Denon receiver. The package and materials indicated this was the remote for me. No problems with my JVC TV and JVC VCR, but not only would it not do more with my receiver, it did nothing with it except power it on and off. No volume, no input switching, no speaker adjustments, no surround mode changing. In fact, it did less than the one I already had."
3,Controls almost everything,"Product worked great except it would not control my cable box (General Instruments - digital cable) I called the support phone and once they answered they told me it would not work on my cable box, but I could return it. For the price it wasn't worth returning it. This makes it useless for me.If it would have controlled everything it is a very nice unit and very easy to use. The backlit pad is nice and it is comfortable to hold. Lots of nice features too."
2,Increase Color but not decrease,Some function work and some don't. On control of TV cannel up and down as well as volume up and down work ok but the control of menu of color increase or any other function worked to incease but would not allow decrease. I have another unit to access the function this one doesn't work and between the to controls I am able to operate. In other words the R- function of the controler does not work.
4,Kids love it!!,I purchased one of these for my kids approximately three years ago. The good news is it still springs just like it did when it was brand new. The bad news as your kids get older and heavier the spring action will not work while they swing. My kids definately enjoyed it when the were younger. So I would say if you have young or very light children it would be a good purchase.
4,Kids love it Spring Swing disc,Gave this to the grandkids for Christmas. It is a big hit with them and their friends. Mom and Dad are happy with it too.
1,Disappointment and poor service from 8th Street,"The description does not tell you that you need strap buttons installed in order to mount this mic. I wanted it so I did not have to modify my guitar--including installing strap buttons. Also, it arrived with the batteries installed and they had leaked all over the battery chamber. It was a gift so I could not return it. 8th Street Music does not accept returns unless it's the original purchaser so beware. Bummer experience."
5,A True Matriarch,"This is a telling story of a giant of a woman. One who held down a man who showed a entire nation of people how to walk upright after 150+ years of beggin and stratching for crumbs. Dr. Betty Shabazz, the total essence of beauty combined with strength."
4,Adapter for netboot,"My company just purchased 20 of these units to use for a deployment of MacBook Airs that will need to have an image pushed out via DeployStudio. We purchased this unit based on the posting here using them as a test. [...]After receiving the units and attempting to netboot the unit was not able to connect. Trying to boot the device while connected to a switch that was then connected to an AirPort Extreme that then had the server also plugged in would not boot with this device. I tested with out the Procurve, plugging everything into the AirPort Extreme and it would netboot fine. I connected another switch and plugged the server and MacBook Air into the switch and it did work in that configuration also.I am taking a star off due to the sorry Tech Support from Belkin. When I said netboot all a heard after that was that it was a netbook I was trying to make work and that just made the call worthless for finding the real issue."
3,link for Mac OSX drivers,"I ordered this from Amazon based on its claimed Mac compatibility. The Quick Install Guide had a label on it saying that a Mac QIG was on the CD in pdf format. There was no Mac QIG, and no Mac driver, on the CD.after a call to Belkin tech support, I was given this link to a ""beta"" driver for Mac OS X:[...]now completing install and restarting to see if it works."
4,Works great with my MacBook Air OSX 10.6.5,I used the mac beta drivers from the Belkin site. I work at a large university with a cisco backbone and have had no problems. Much faster that the Apple dongle. Only complaints... the high price and the very bright blue lights.
3,"Seems cool, but does not work with Windows RT","The form factor is ideal for a tablet device since it will stay attached, but this product does not work with Windows RT / Surface RT because it uses proprietary drivers."
1,A Modern Minimalist Disaster,"I sadly wasted approximately 2 hours of my life listening to this sorely lacking ""opera"". I was not at all surprised to read in the notes that the score had never actually been written to the piece, but rather, Monk came to the studio with a few ideas and improvised much of the work. The tracks repeat endlessly without any meaningful development. Some of them contain nonsensical dialogue as well, which adds little to the opera's overall effect. Listen to the sample track ""Ice Demons"" for a good demonstration of ludicrous and pretentious composition. While I'm not a devoted fan of minimalism in general, I can at least enjoy it on occassion. In my opinion, some minimalist works like ""Einstein on the Beach"" by Philip Glass are far more sophisticated than Monk's opera and don't have the aggravating tendency to take themselves too seriously. Monk's overdramatic spiritual nonsense really gets on the nerves."
1,Utter garbage,"Don't get me wrong. I like some of Meredith Monk's stuff (when she's not on some hallucinogen), but this is going to far. Plot, musical coherence, dramatism, take your pick--unfortunately, none of it is there. Experimentation is all well and good if you can pull it off at least with some minor hint of artistic expression, but Atlas is utterly nonsensical and way too repetitive to be considered a work of art. If, after hearing this, you are still brave enough to give Meredith Monk another try, check out Book of Days. It's much more musically coherent and much easier to grasp. It also, in my opinion, is a much better expression of Monk's continuing search to expand the capabilities of the human voice."
3,My 5th Wish:,Is for Wes Craven to take the reigns back and make this series speak for itself by getting Andrew Divoff again and making it darker in nature like Freddy Krueger.The actors were laughing at themselves in the extras in 'Gates of Hell = Sword of Justice even the actress that got laid on the floor of the college dorm. Nice Boobies!!!
1,power ranger horror,If you are looking for an absolutely horrendous sequel to the Wishmaster this is it. I haven't seen the third installment of wishmaster but thought the first two with the original actor who played Wishmaster were great. I picked this sequel up figuring it was wishmaster and wouldn't be that bad...boy was I wrong. It was like a mix between Power Rangers and Japanese Anime/old-school Godzilla. Not only is the acting horrible but the story is too. What happened to the good quality old school horror that was good even if the story was horrible it was a decent movie worth seeing...the Prophecy Fullfilled is not and I will say DO NOT waste your mney...it is disappointing.
3,The wish master love story?,ok this movie really was'nt that great... but it was much better then the third installment. Ok! well the Djin is trying to get this girl to fall in love with him. Haha i know pretty dumb plot right? It has fairly decent gore and the actor chosen to be the wishmaster does a far better job then the one in part 3. My advice for any movie is to rent it before you buy it.
2,I wish I hadn't watched this...,"This movie is awful. Don't see it. It's not a horror movie...WAY to much nudity, I strongly recommend you skip this movie. Watch Wishmaster 1 & 2 instead."
2,Nothin' Like The Original,"Alright, this is one of those films that makes you wish they would have just made the original and left it alone. Wishmaster was awesome, this one is not. If you liked part 3 than you will like this one, but than again if you liked part 3, you my friend are on the soft side-if you know what I mean. I've got to admit that I was impressed with the strong sexual content within the first ten minutes of the movie! That woman is hot! I also enjoyed the part where the office guy practically cuts off his face with his pocketknife. Very gory scene, to bad it is the only one in the movie. Don't get me wrong, there are other decent death scenes, however they are not as gory as that one. Definatley worth the rent on DVD, but not the buy! Rated R for adult language, graphic violence, strong sexual content, and nudity."
5,Do you wish it???,The Wishmaster is one of my favorites! If you are a fan of bad horror/fantasy/sci-fi movies you're going to like this one.
2,Ok if you like scary movies,I wouldn't recommend this movie it was ok if your a wishmaster fan like me but I wouldn't watch it again.
3,The nudity helps,"A woman (with an amazing rack) accidentally releases a demon into the world. He helps her with some legal matters and wants her soul in return, but first he'll give her three wishes.It's a no-brainer movie that is fun if you take it for what it is."
5,A Holiday Classic,"After hearing Matthew play at Nordstrom in Downtown Portland this past summer, I bought both his CDs. I often am disappointed when I buy CDs on a whim like that because the live performance seems so much better. But I wasn't disheartened. This is the perfect album to put in the background of a holiday dinner party or as a soundtrack for a wintry drive through the snow."
5,Great find,"Great price for the product. I don't care to much for the smell so I add essential oils when I use it for my hair. Make sure to melt it well (don't boil) and mix with coconut oil for your hair, excellent hair product for african american hair or a mix. A little greasy at first on the body, but give it a few mins and your good."
3,Not sure it is pure,"I bought it based on customer reviews here. I do not plan on reordering from this seller, as I don't believe this shea butter is pure. My order is deep yellow/gold, almost mustard in color and while I'm aware the color of unrefined shea butter ranges from ivory/beige to yellow, this one is either mixed with palm oil or something else or the stock is very old. At the bottom of the box, I found traces of white/beige colored butter.Another point of concern I have is that the price it is being sold for now is less than half of what I paid just a few months ago.I have recently purchased unrefined shea butter, which is ivory (not white) in color, from another retailer that claims to be a fair trade organization. I love it so far. It feels a lot better on skin and has a much better consistency."
1,got less than I paid for,got less than I paid for. I ordered 4 16 oz containers and non of them weighed 16 ounzes. I weight each one on an ounce scale that I use to weight out soap ingredients and its very sensitive. All be it an ounce is not so much but 4 ounces is 25% of a pound and at those prices its not fair
1,Do Not Buy This,"This is the most disgusting, gross smelling product.I think it smells like a petroleum chemical of some kind. It made me feel sick.I've spent lots of time trying to get the smell off of my hands and I can still notice it.It is also hard as a rock.The label says to use as a lip balm - thanks for the tip but I think I'll pass."
3,Okay for the price but you can find better,"I really like 100% pure and raw shea butter. It's a great moisturizer if you have alligator skin. I also enjoy using it as a hair conditioner (have to experiment to figure out what's best for hair so it's not too heavy- a little bit goes a long way). This is a great price for pure shea butter. I have found a better quality shea butter (the lighter colored shea butters are creamier, less grit) on another site for a comparable price so I will not be ordering from this supplier again. It took way too long to receive my order (over two weeks) with no communication from the merchant."
2,disappointed,This is the yellow shea butter thats sold in those oriental shops for a cheap pricing. The product is okay not the better quality or grade of shea butters. I assumed this would of been the white shea butter and more solid. This has a very yellow coloring and a overly strong scent.
2,Not too Happy About It!,"I have placed two (2) orders of this product and I was pleased with my bulk shipment at THAT time. Most recently I ordered 10Lbs of Shea on 2 day delivery on Dec.1, 2010. on Dec. 3, 2010 when my delivery DID NOT show up I tracked my package online and called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE & AWARE! Online showed the package in San Fransisco,CA! I live in Sacramento, CA! Amazon told me that there was nothing they could do until my delivery came. ALIVE & AWARE NEVER RETURNED my recorded message! I received my 10Lbs. Shea of bulk Shea on MONDAY, Dec. 6, 2010 @ 7:00p.m. PST. When I opened the box I sadly discovered 10-16oz. plastic containers filled with lumps of Shea. I immediately called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE & AWARE and as of today Dec. 14, 2010 I have not received any follow-up phone call or my refund. SO BUYERS BEWARE! I since have found better success at [...]"
1,Smells,This Shea butter is just disgusting to me!! It stinks it feels horrible on my skin. I'll just stick to my victoria secret lotions!!!
1,Big Hoo-Ha Over Nothing,"Though the transaction and delivery were excellent,the shea butter itself was a no-win.I would have gotten the same results from regular skin lotion. Marketers know the value of exploitation and exagerration and this was one of those times.But I wanted to try it--and was disappointed."
1,Smells awful and doesn't appear to be 100 hygenic...,I found what appears to be a strand of human hair and bits of other stuff in there (hull of the seed maybe?). You do get a lot. And it smells god-awful. Purchase this only if you like smelling like a greasy ashtray.
1,Not pure shea butter,"I'm almost positive that this shea butter is not pure, it's grade F. The shea butter I bought had a weird smell, and was discolored, the shea butter had dark blackish spots all over. Back to the smell, I can't even begin to try and describe the smell, I just remember that it made me want to throw up. Generally, shea butter has a smokey or roasted smell, this shea butter did not. I stopped using it for that reason I never sent it back because I was too lazy and didn't feel like it."
5,"Hair, skin and foot miracle!!","Before a shower, coat your hair with the Shea Butter, put on a shower cap and heat with a blow-dryer for 5-10 minutes. Then shampoo. Great deep conditioning and helps end breakage and split ends.After shower, coat feet and put on socks. Babby soft feet by morning!Great for after shaving.Put a few table spoons in bath water for a natural and cheap bath oil. Skin is silky smooth and you don't have to spend all that time rubbing it in."
5,The Best Thing You Can Do For Your Hair and Skin,The title of this review says it all. Everyone should use unrefined shea butter for everything!
2,Smell?,Can anyone tell me how this is supposed to smell? It's pretty yellow in color and smells a bit rancid.
1,NOT ACTUALLY SHEA BUTTER!,"Not only is this not ""100% Organic West African Shea Butter"", it's not really shea butter at all. I'm at a loss as to what it was that I got in the package. Unrefined Shea Butter (which is not what I received) ranges from almost white to a pale yellow, and has a nutty, smoky scent. This ""shea butter"" was mustard yellow, melts at body temperature, but smells like cocoa butter! On top of that, the plastic package that I received it in was dirty. If I could do it again, I would spend the few extra bucks to get a real pound of unrefined shea butter from a verified fair trade company. DO NOT BUY THIS STUFF! IT IS NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED!"
3,Very grainy.,"This makes the second time I purchased this and this purchase is different from my first purchase. First purchase came in a bag and was creamy. This purchase came in a plastic container, which is fine, but is so terribly grainy and much softer. Even after melting it completely and cooling quickly, its still grainy, but not as bad. I hope in my next formulation it smooths out, otherwise I can't really use it except maybe in making soap. It is a raw shea butter and has the nutty smell, and it does feel good on the skin aside the grainyness. It just needs to be tempered with to bring it to smoothness. Also, the listing says organic, but no where on the packaging does it say it's organic. It also says there is no expiration date for shea butter. True, it does have a long shelf of 18-24 months, but it eventually will turn rancid just like all oils and butters do. Probably will not purchase this again, and will look more into refined shea butter."
4,Good Product Fast Service,"My first order of shea butter so not sure of long-term benefits. If you live where the product might freeze during the delivery process, be sure to ask for special packing such as newspaper to insulate it. I tried mixing it with my Kitchen Aid, and it came out pretty well. The process is messy, but the shea butter cleans easily with HOT water. The mixture turned out gritty (probably because it froze during delivery), but it becomes smooth when I rub it in and feels good on my skin. I added some jojoba oil and lavender essence - I'll try peppermint next time. It leaves my skin slippery looking but wiping with a kleenex helps. It seems greasy but is not, so it doesn't leave spots on clothing or bed sheets, etc. I got the oil too, which turned out to be effective and less fussy."
5,This is Wonderful,"I looked around for a while for good shea butter and I stumbled on this product. The price was reasonal enough for me to try it. When I got it, it was double the size of the picture and it is in chunks in a clear plastic tub. At first I didnt like the smell but once I put it on it faded within a couple minutes but the more I put it on the more I liked the smell and now I dont even notice it. It melts easily in your hands and rubs on smooth and if you have dry skin it really penetrates and moisturizes the skin. I really recommend it for people with dry skin it works wonders. They also delivered super fast and it was packaged nicely I will definitely buy from here again. Great price and a great product."
4,African Shea Butter,Received product quickly. This product is real 100% shea butter.(Unlike other suppliers that blend butter w/ other moisturizers.) Shea Butter is a great moisturizer & can be used to reduce appearance of scars from acne.I am very happy w/ product. I have ordered extra containers to shared it w/ several family members.
1,"It's a GOOD BUTTER, BUT IT'S NOT SHEA BUTTER","I hate to say this, but the picture doesn't represent what was sent to me. REAL shea butter is an IVORY to BEIGE color, this is a MUSTARD YELLOW color. The butter being labeled as ""Shea Butter,"" is in fact Kpangnan butter, an African butter SIMILAR to the qualities inherent in SHEA BUTTER. It's a good butter, but Shea butter is better and I'm giving it a 1 because the seller either doesn't know or either does know and isn't being honest.Secondly, Shea butter has a MUCH stronger sent, isn't waxy feeling.I'm only keeping the butter because I don't feel like sending this back.I'll be ordering from someone else in the future and not on here as many 3rd party vendors are selling this African Butter as ""Shea Butter."""
3,African Shea Butter Creams,"I have been using the product for a short while, however not on a consistent basis. The product arrived in big chunks, not smooth and creamy. The chunks have to be broken into small pieces, rolled and warmed in your hands before it can be applied to the skin. I am beginning to see slight improvement in the condition of my skin. I plan to purchase the oil to blend with it for easier application."
1,NOT SHEA BUTTER,"When I first received the package in the mail it smelled strange. I could smell it without opening the box. I opened it and there was a greasy plastic bag with what looked like a yellow blob of play doh. It was way more yellow than the picture, but I didn't think anything of it. It smelled worse inside the box and when I opened it I had to hold my breath. I had read that unrefined REAL shea butter has a MILD smell. This was overwhelming. So overwhelming that when I melted it together with beeswax and added many drops of scent oils of lip balms, but you can still smell it. The texture is weirdly sticky and greasy and leaves residue on anything it touches.I wish I had read through the 1 star reviews before purchasing. I read through a few that said it was actually Kpangnan Butter so I googled it. They were ABSOLUTELY right. Not what I paid for."
5,excellent for homemade lotion bars,"Used this product with coconut oil, beeswax and lemongrass oil (with a drop of Vit. E oil) to make natural lotion bars. Easy to work with; bars are excellent."
3,Not easy to use,"This is very solid, not easy to put on skin. It also takes a while to absorb and has a light but funny smell. I will not buy again I will look for something that is organic with shea butter but added natural ingredients to make it more fluid."
5,Love it!,I had never tried pure Shea butter in it's natural form before. I have used it under my eyes and wow in just a few days there is a big difference. The products sold on the market for under eye area do not compare. It makes my hands so soft. The rough skin on feet is gone. I must say a little goes a long way. I just hold a little bit in my hands until the body's warmth softens it up.
4,S100% Organic West African Shea Butter Review,"The delivery was quick and prompt, and the quantity you receive for the price you pay is a bargain.I currently use it on a daily basis and it does its job. With all of the products out there,it is hard to tell what is really the ""Natural Shea Butter"" product but as far as I am concerned thisproduct is good."
3,An honest testimony from a real customer.,"Good moisturizer! Purity is questionable as it is with any ""All natural"" product. This is a great moisturizer, you only need a little bit to cover any area. I hope it's really unrefined shea butter as seller claims. I gave it a three because I am not sure about it's purity. I will try shea butter from different sellers and compare smells and colors."
4,Satisified!!,"Im not a expert when it comes to butters ; HOWEVER, It is a Big portion and happy with the butter. No complaints"
4,100% Organic West African Shea Butter 16 oz,"Used it for face and hand creams.Very good quality, smells well.Color is light yellow. Looks fresh.Happy with this purchase."
1,horrible,"i just got this product in the mail today. it looks very suspicious to me.butter - the consistency is mushy and some of it is hard. also the color varies from bright yellow to ivory, which also looks unnatural.packaging - dirty plastic bag that is poorly sealed. also there is a small dirty sticker that is barely attached to the bag and it says ""100% organic west african shea butter"".this is the worst product ever i got from amazon"
1,regret,"i got this shea butter after hearing and reading how great it is for all type of skin condition. I had one before - very hard, ivory looking, but quicly melting - but this one is soo diferent. the color is very yellow, the type what fake mustartd has. i was trying to use it as a diaper cream, as a dry skin moistureizer and treating very mild eczema and scars but it did not do anything to any above mentioned problem. After several days I still did not see any result nor improvment. That is when I started to think of the authenticity of this product. I think I will stop using it since I have no proof of its originality and beside it really does not work. I am sad, I wish I could return it. I will try to contact the seller. If you want the real thing dont buy it."
2,"Funky packaging, weird smell.",This shea butter came double bagged in a heat sealed plastic baggie. It smelled very strange and had a weird appearance.
4,Great Product for sealing moisture in your hair!...although it smells bad,"I love this product! I mix it with coconut oil and olive oil and use it as a skin moisurizer and I put on my hair to seal in moisture. My hair is natural ""black hair"" and ever since I've been using this mixture my hair has been growing like weeds!"
1,Not shea butter,"What I received is not shea butter it's actually Kpangnan Butter or African Butter, totally different than shea butter. It's dyed bright yellow which stains your skin and clothes, it's greasy, has a strong odor and is more gritty than shea. Unrefined shea butter is softer than cocoa butter, ivory in color, the odor is very faint and it absorbs easily. Not happy at all with my purchase, I'll never buy anything from this seller again"
1,Only 14 1/2oz and not Shea butter,Very disappointed. Bright yellow and you can tell it has been mixed with some other oil and poured into plastic tub.I then wanted to check the weight as I HAVE paid for 16oz and it weighs 14 1/2oz (with the lid taken off!) (15 oz with the lid on).I am guessing that the product is going to weight less than 14oz when its out of the plastic tub.Will not use as I have too sensitive skin to try something that I do not know the full ingredients of.Do not waste your money or your time.
4,excellent for face and whole body,Found this product to be the best moisturizer so far for cold winter days. I apply it on my face and on the whole body after bath. It is very well absorbed by the skin and leaves it smooth and silky. It's superior to sophisticated chemical mixtures (cosmetic creams) at much higher price.I mix it with argan oil for easier spreading and enhanced beneficial effects.The reason I dropped one star is the slight inconsistency in different batches of shea butter (purchased at different time) - some smell and feel better than others.
2,This Shea Butter is Not What I Expected,I have used organic West African Shea Butter before from other vendors and it was never this yellow. I had to melt the Shea Butter then strain out impurities before using it for my soap. The yellow color remained in my bars so that colors did not remain the same (blue color turned into green because of the yellow soap). I would not purchase this Shea Butter again.
5,Colorful Art,"Used on bathroom window for privacy but to make good use of light. Pattern looks as good on the outside view as it does inside. The colors are more vibrant than the picture, and I would not consider it to be pastel. We have blue ceramic tile from the '50's that is still in excellent shape, and peachy tan sink, commode, tub. The floor is also ceramic tile in shades of blue, black, peach. How lucky to find something to bring these colors not only together, but into this century! Very modern & chic."
5,Choke without the chain!,"This type of collar was originally recommended by my trainer, gives the choke effect without the rough, dangerous chain. Have yet to find them in the stores."
3,Hmm....,"When I first heard this, I was disappointed. After a few listens, my opinion of the new Local H songs improved, but not my opinion of their covers. The new Local H songs might be Local H-by-the-numbers, but are catchy enough to warrant a listen. The covers are not very catchy or good. Local H's performance just accentuates the covers' hooks (since Local H is all about the hooks), which are quite dated and therefore not catchy. Oh well. The new Local H songs are worth listening to, but most likely not for the price you'd pay for this new."
5,Ordered wrong item,"I have sent in a response to this product already, but since it looks like you have changed your format, I will respond again. I thought I was ordering the storybook of the Legend of the Candy Cane, but it was the DVD. I did not open it and immediately sent it back to the seller. I could not review the product since I did not watch it, but your system required me to rate it."
5,Very happy,I have had this one in the SUV powering 12 inch subs for about a year now. Works great and has never given a problem. I am ordering another one for the Mustang and thought I would post a review. Power rating is a little high but offers a lot of punch.
5,GREAT GIFT,"I MUST SAY THIS ITEM LOOKED BETTER THAN IT SHOWED ON THE ORDER PAGE.IT WAS QUITE A PLEASANT SURPRISE.I WOULD SAY BUY ONE IF YOU LIKE IT,YOU TO WILL BE SURPRISED."
4,"Well made, feels valuable, if a bit thick","I'm very pleased w/ this well-built watch. It looks and feels luxurious. It's thick - not the pretty thin type, but its quality keeps me happy. A little hard to read; the hands are skeletal. A slight tilt of the wrist will catch the light and all will be clear. The luminous bits don't work so well. Not good at night.Overall, though, quite acceptable."
4,Beautiful watch.,"Beautiful watch. If you follow the winding/wearing instructions carefully, the watch should keep time effectively. It has a nice, substantial appearance, great for women who prefer a more substantial watch over a dainty one. Looks good even on very small wrists, but is large enough to look good on larger wrists. Stuhrling has a solid reputation as a watchmaker and seems willing to work with customers on their satisfaction with their products."
4,overall good watch,"I have been wearing this watch for several days now. Love the weight of it, you know you are wearing it. It's not a dainty watch, but it's also not too big for a small wrist. Has been keeping perfect time. I was able to purchase from Amazon for $95 - not sure why it is listed for $249 and then you can click on a separate link within to purchase for $95. Was listed as ""NEW"" on both."
1,Not recommeded for its inaccuracy,"just got one for xmas and the watch is fast by about 4 minutes each day since I synched it against the ""internet"" clock on my computer 4 days ago! I am off by 16 to 17 minutes in less than a week. I can't imagine what the watch will show after a couple more weeks! the inaccuracy of the automatic movement defeats the purpose of having a watch. I would not recommend this watch. I loved my old swatch which is cheaper, also swiss made, but keeps time accurately.UPDATE after 1 year: COMPLETE waste of money! I would give it zero star if I can. Had enough of this watch. NEVER kept accurate time, defeats the whole notion of wearing a watch!BUY another brand!!! waste of $>$100! I am buying a swiss made Swatch.....keeps time precisely and effortlessly. Going back to a battery watch - until I can afford the real Rolex!"
1,Trying SO HARD to get through this book,It's not that it's boring. It's that it's an advertisement.I recieved this book as a freebee with the holosync prologue. It's got some nice information which is why it's so annoying that the author has to mention how great his program is and why you should get it just about every 5 sentances. I'm up to chapter 3 and I just can't take anymore. If you have the patience to read the constant commercial I guess it's a good book.
5,Deeply explanatory,"Bill Harris goes beyond simple explanations in this profoundly powerful, yet easily understood gem. This is the type of book that gives you the ah hah reaction to the whys of certain actions taken in your life, and breaks it down so it is understandable. Not your typical self help style book, that may offer exercises, but guides you along the path of discovery. Read this book, but also go to Bill Harris' web page and order his meditating style self help called Holosync. This is the stuff that will give you tremendous breakthroughs, and reading more on self help will be because you want to, not because your searching for the answer. Life through Holosync becomes quiet, less confusing, and clearer. Take it from me, the stuff works and I don't like to meditate."
5,"A Powerful ""Complete"" Philosophy of Personal Growth","Bill Harris will, in this book, recommend his ""Holosync"" Audio Soundtracks as a major method of evolutionary change. I am on level II of Holosync and love it.However, even without using his Audio Meditation Tools, this book is an incredible model of personal growth. He tells exactly where all addictions come from, and why all dysfunctional behaviors are merely attempts to keep the current ""system"" from being overwhelmed.He tells how to stop resisting personal growth through dysfunctional behaviors, and instead become a ""witness"", watching yourself grow. You will experience physical, mental, spiritual, and emotional change, and gain a much greater measure of happiness and peace.It helps you understand yourself, and how you create your own obstacles through resisting growth. If you are into meditation or any type of personal improvement, get this book.Christopher Westra - Author ""I Create Reality - Beyond Visualization"""
5,This Is the Real Deal,"This is one terrific book, and can be read on its own or in concert with the Holosync Technology tapes or CDs, which are available through the author's Centerpointe Research Institute.I would recommend it to anyone who has been involved in meditation and who would like to increase the speed with which the long term positive effects of meditation can be attained.The evidence given to support the upside effects of brain entrainment through use of Bill Harris' technology is overwhelming and impossible to ignore."
1,Pure Hype,"The author of this book, Bill Harris, is a huckster. A low-grade plaid-pantsed salesman whose singular purpose is to make as much money as possible. The program that the book sells ad-nauseum is extremely over-priced. The techniques described (ad-nauseum) are very basic NLP (Neruo Linguistic Programming) and have been available for years. You can get the same audio recordings on you-tube for free. This book is simply a come-on designed as an inducement to sign up for an outrageously expensive lengthy course of study, practice and retreats (the cost of a 5-day retreat is about $2500.00).All of what is covered in this book and in the ensueing course ""training"" is available free or for very little cost on the internet and in your local bookstore or here on Amazon.Don't waste your money and be insulted by this Charlatan."
2,Big sales pitch,"I just got finished reading this book. I agree with one of the other posters, that this is a BIG COMMERCIAL to 'buy into' his program! I bought this book on Amazon here, for $4.00 (thank God!). The CD's and such would have put me in the poor house!! I searched online and found a fabulous CD called 'Balance' that is just ONE CD, and it claims to do the exact same thing as Bill Harris' program, only for at least $1000.00 cheaper! I would much rather spend $20 on a CD than be sucked into 12 CD's that aren't gurarunteed to work (even if he says they're guarunteed, good luck getting all your money back!).I liked the explaination of the mind and such, but I had to skip through all the 'Commercial's' in order to get to the 'meat' of the book.I've been suckered to much in my life on this kind of stuff, thank God I learned through my past mistakes!"
1,Repeats and Overpriced Marketing,"""If you have no plans to do the Holosync program, this book will really be nothing more to you than a long commercial for the product complete with pages of endorsements. You can find far more referenced sources to learn about brain entrainment technologies elsewhere if that's what you are looking for, you can read about some of the wild experiences some people have had using these techniques in Robert Monroe's books (he of Hemi-Sync fame and founder of the Monroe Institute) which pre-dated Harris' work by some time, and you can find way better books on change and spiritual growth."""
4,Link to the turning point!,"Thresholds of the Mind is a very rare find. This book was recommended by a friend who said that the book will inspire me to move on to the next level, which is meditation.It is very concise and informative.If you want to try holosync, read this book!We need not be stressed with what is happening to us everyday! We need to live a peaceful life despite the odds we encounter.Read this book...it is the link to the turning point in your life, which is becoming a better person!"
5,The best book on psychology and healing there is.,"This book is for people doing the program, there are negative reviews from people who clearly have never tried it. Their comments don't count for anything. That's the problem with some people on the internet."
4,I found this to be an amusing book,"This is an amusing light read. It helps you start to think like a Cultural Anthropologist. It is good for people to realize that there are more ways to do things than just the way their own country does it. If we can learn about other cultures, we can make our world a better place. Yes, that quote is cheesy but, it is also true. If you want to learn a little bit and have a chuckle while doing so, this is a good book!"
3,more taboos than do.,"This book is told, in a loose, style.The book repeats itself, from chapter,to chapter. and it`s more ho hum thanfunny. However, there are some lol,in this book, but they're a chore, to find. Axtell; fails to follow his own advice. ""68% of your audience will quit listening, if you talk more than 20 minutes."" This book is useful, for first time globe trotters, The lol chapter on cruising, is worth the price of the book.this book would've been better, if it include samples of lol jokes, from around the world."
5,"Great Company. Quality Products,",This company has been the easiest to deal with out of all the housing supply companies I have dealt with. They always ship on time and the customer service is great. I highly recommend this company.
1,Very short,"I had high hopes for this cami, it looked to have nice detail, good quality. It did not. The cami was too short, the straps were off ... The lace was low quality. The embellishments looked better in the picture then on the actual garment."
1,Big waste of money,"One of the dumbest films I've ever seen, yes ever seen! A big waste of money spent on making it and a big waste of money to spend watching it."
1,oh nooooooo!,Yes this movie was the most lame and hilarious movie I have ever seen! There isn't a comedy out there any funnier. Watch it for a good laugh but for nothing else!
1,A Waste of Film,"When I say a film is a waste of time and money, it must be true. I LOVE obscure horror titles, and zombie movies are my favorites. But this one is a waste, as I should've been able to tell from the title. Don't watch this one at all. Forget what it's about. Just steer clear of this one."
3,granny gone campy,"OMG! What a classic campy movie! It took me awhile to find this movie, that is untill I found the gift of Amazon! I truelly love this movie and am so happy to have got a copy to add to my movie collection. The feel for this movie is dark and campy, it's fun to watch as this movie starts to unfold into gory horror comedy fun! The Granny has gone crazy! Stella does a great role as she steels every scene she's in, having fun with her on-liners and makeup. The rest of the cast does an okay job given that they really dont have much to work with. The script is kindda weak with a little plot holes but besides that, this is truely a dark comedy horror. Remeber to not take this film too serious cause the point is to just have fun! If you ever come across this, grab a copy, sitt back, and get ready to laugh and scream you decapitated head off! The granny has come home-and this time it's a killer reunion!"
4,Cheap Gore Trip,"Well, this movie is definitely a first rate B-film as it has all the necessary components: bad acting, horrible make-up/special effects, no plot whatsoever, cheaply attractive women, and tons and tons of GORE! Yes, that is what makes the Granny so entertaining, truthfully. After drinking a magic potion without performing the required ""Cleansing Ritual"" and leaving it in direct sunlight, the greedy old grandmother is transformed into a cannibalistic zombie hungry for the flesh and blood of her own family. Unfortunately, it's not scary in any way, shape, or form, but it's definitely filled with laugh after laugh when you realize what a joke this film is. It also features Shannon Whirry (who I honestly don't believe is that attractive) and Heather Elizabeth Parkhurst (who is pretty, but is such a poor actress that her perfomance might rival that of Anna Nicole Smith's in the Naked Gun 33 1/3). Absolutely worth owning for the comedic/gore value."
2,A New Role Model for Hagglers Everywhere!,"The term ""haggler"", contrary to what most people think when they hear it (""one who haggles""), has become a great inside joke word to me and my friends. A haggler, to us, is an old frump with an ugly voice, who may or may not make ugly faces and gestures. It developed from characters like the Granny, and old hags that can only be imitated with raspy exaggeration and by plugging your nose. But about the movie.. all I can say is that by all conventional standards, it is truly terrible. Most reviewers have already said that the plot sucks, it has bad acting and bad make-up, etc. The Granny was entertaining, but far from being a good movie. The *ONLY* reason I would recommend this movie to anyone is that it will make you laugh. If you enjoy ridiculous horror movies like me, you won't be disappointed, but don't even think about buying it otherwise."
1,Not worth the money,This little pamphlet is only 45 pages long and costs sixty dollars. It just has some screen shots and is very simplistic. Save your money!
1,Absolutely Useless,"This booklet, as with most SPSS booklets from this time, is virtually useless. On a 10 point scale it would be a ""1"". SPSS for Psychologists is about 1 bazillion times more useful."
3,Why is this missing Elvis Costello & Allen Toussaint's moving FREEDOM FOR THE STALLION?,"Towards the end of this amazing PBS concert, Elvis Costello sang Allen Toussaint's amazing obscure song ""Freedom For The Stallion"" featuring Mr. Toussaint himself on piano.It was, on my opinion, one of the most spellbinding performances I have ever seen in television.It's amazing that this priceless performance was left off this new CD collection."
4,Disappointed,"I watched this program in it's entirety when it aired live on PBS and was thrilled by the incredible lineup of wonderful performers who gave equally wonderful performances! However, many of the night's most breathtaking performances were left off this CD completely! Wynton Marsalis' opening with ""A'in no"" ...Peter Cincotti's original ""Bring Back New Orleans""...the list goes on. I must say I'm disappointed to see that so many stellar performances were not included and I'm puzzled as to why!"
4,The Man Behind the Controversy,"Given the amount of attention placed on Darwin's ideas for the last 150 years, it is an interesting new twist to examine the man himself. The aspects of Darwin's life on which he chooses to focus his self-description are, naturally, very revealing. He portrays himself as methodical and extremely devoted to his various passions, be they hunting, beetle-collecting, or writing. It seems that although Darwin was fairly social in his youth, his health precluded many visitors from calling on him later in life; perhaps this gave him time to complete his many works! This is an engaging and entertaining look at the man behind the books that impacted so much in the world of science."
1,Mine fell apart,"First, let me qualify by stating that I did not purchase this item through Amazon; but I purchased the exact same brand and item at a retail store as a Christmas gift for a friend. He had it for approximately one week, holding 4 remotes, when a piece fell off. When I picked it up to see what happened, the ENTIRE holder fell apart completely - - it is evidently just glued together. It's too bad, because this is a VERY nice looking item, we really liked the fact that it swiveled on a round base, and it worked great for the one week it held together. Perhaps I got a lemon. I'd say take your chances; maybe you'll get one that's glued together better than the one I purchased."
4,Good Bike,"This is a good bike for the price of $179.99 with free shipping. The frame is sturdy and the bike overall is well built. The gears were not changing properly and skipped at times which resulted in bike being taken to local shop for a tune-up. Also had the brakes adjusted as part of the tune-up. Bike is much better now and provides a nice ride. The seat was quite hard, but a gel seat cover made things much better. I feel the bike is an excellent entry level bike and fits my need for occasional use."
3,A Schwinn for my Son,"My son is a teen and hard on his bike's so I decided to get him a bike that got me through my teen years- a Schwinn. The Schwinn was moderately priced--not the low end models that you see in chain stores.It was easy to put together out of the box but I could not get the geers to work, shift into higher or lower geers and not rub against the derailer. I contacted Schwinn and they tried to walk me through the manual to adjust and set the geers.I decided to take it to a local bike store who was unable to adjust the geers either as per the manual and they ended up replacing the very cheap, flimsy derailer that came with the bike with a solid steel one. Now the bike is great... looks great and rides great.One key part needed to be upgraded to make this a sturdy bike. Too bad Schwinn didn't think of this previously as I am sure other customers complained."
4,good beginner bike,I am female and pruchased this bike when I started trail riding. It is a bit heavy but I loved riding it. Good starter bike for the money. Would recommend it for beginners.
4,Decent bike for the price,"I ordered this bike for my husband in May, and got it for 238.60, which included shipping. I ordered the Navy bike, and was surprised to find that it included the water bottle and cage, which was not in the photo. The instructions for assembling weren't the best, since they covered other models besides this one (""if your bike has blah blah blah..."") Since I am not that familiar with all of the terminology of bicycles I found it difficult to know whether or not the bike had the feature being described. But, we were able to assemble it ourselves with not a lot of trouble. We are still adjusting the brakes, but he's given it a test ride and overall we are happy with the purchase."
1,Worst gears ever,"I purchased this type of Schwinn Mountain bike and the gears on the back wheel are the cheapest piece of #@$@ you'll ever come across. On the second day that it was ridden the gears on the back wheel completely shattered, and I'm not kidding. I went from having 7 gears on the back wheel to having 6. The ones that were left spun freely as they were no longer attached to the wheel. The inner connecting points completely busted.I returned the bike and exchanged it for an identical system. I thought that it was a singular issue, but this time on the first ride out the gears shattered again. As soon as I start peddling hard up a hill they're gone. Now paying to upgrade the gears on the back tire to something worth having.Save your money and time and go buy a higher end bike that will actually last. I used to think Schwinn were an upgrade from Huffy, but they're the same piece of crap under a different name."
5,River Of Life,Awsome. This is one of the better - if not among the absolute best - pieces of music ever written. This is one that can be played for hours and still not get enough of it.
5,Great For Multiple-day Hikes,"This book is very portable (slim and easy to carry). While it includes day hikes in the first section, the second section is great if you are planning to hike (and camp) for more than one day. Not only does it include trail descriptions, mileage, it also offers advice on how many miles to do per day, etc. I did find one ""error"" during the Hazel Mountain day hike section (the mileage in the text doesn't match the mileage in the description) but that's not major. Overall, GREAT BOOK!"
2,Timothy's Colombian Disappointment,"Ordered my box of coffee pouches in January 2008 and product was delivered promptly. Unfortunately the best-before date was 18 December last year!. I've heard other reviewers had similar problem. That's a bit shabby of Amazon. I didn't much care for the taste of the coffee either and will end up giving it away. I'm sure Amazon would let me return it for a refund but for a box of coffee, I just haven't got the time to waste. Bad Amazon... maybe perishable foods is not a great idea for an ""eTaler"". I've had good experience with Amazon on hard goods to date."
5,Piano Concerto,Piano Concerto is a recording under the direction of Neeme Jarvi who leads the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra on this Deutsche Grammophon release from 1986. Lilya Zilberstein being the soloist (piano) does an outstanding job. Anthony Burton has written the well-written music notes. Highly recommended. 5/5.
2,DIDN'T MEET EXPECTATIONS,"This antenna, when installed outside, provided only slight improvement over ""rabbit ear"" antenna for local station reception."
1,Don't waste your money,"Like the other reviewer said, this is truly a dud. In fact, it made the reception on a few channels worse in my Manhattan apartment. I ended up having to order cable anyway.If you need an antenna, buy an ourdoor one. This is one is expensive and utterly useless."
3,Don't expect miracles if you live in the middle of nowhere!,"Someone once told me that the worse outdoor antenna is better then the best indoor antenna. This antenna works both in and outdoors, but the secret is to align the dish so that it is optimized for where you are in relation to the surrounding station antennas. If you live in between two cities like I do, this antenna gives you good signals on most of the channels"
4,Better than most internal antennas,"I mounted this antenna in the attic for convenience sake because I did not want to deal with external issues like mounting it to the roof, grounding it, visual detractions. Reception depends on where you situate the unit, as that changed based on location and even whether you tilted it on its side, but it is improved. I suspect that external mounting would further improve things. I had to replace one of the crimp connectors as it fell off during installation. That is something to watch out for."
1,Poor choice,"This is the sixth antenna I've tried. Yet again, another dud. Poor reception across the board, even worse than the TERK I was so dissatisfied with."
3,Not Satisfied completely,"I bought the Tv3000 from a computer swapmeet. I got a good price, but the results are varied. I cannot get all of the channels to come in clear. I followed instructions, but due to my setup, I could not do some of the things they instructed me to do. I live near the ocean....does that have anything to do with it? Any tips to get better reception on some channels? The manual said that if this happens, I am either living in a bad location, did not follow the manual. I must live in a bad location...."
3,Bible reading is accurate but I don't like the voice,The voice of this cd (by Mike Kellog) is a little bit too dramatic for me and instead of focusing on Scripture I am distracted by his voice. I give it 3 stars because at least it is the Word of God on CD but not 5 stars because I don't like the voice. I know some people love his voice but I sure wish I'd listened to him before I bought this CD.
4,A good read,"Battletech purists will likely find this series to be lacking as it falls short in terms of political intrigue and technical precision. That said, it is a good read with a decent storyline and interesting characters. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase future installments."
4,This is great,This book has everything that makes Battletech great. We learn more about Jerimiah Rose and his past. We get great battles where main characters get injured and even killed. Nothing about the book is certain until the very end and even then it leaves you wanting more. Only Stackpole writes Battletech better.
2,I wish Beef would focus more on downtempo/electronica...,"Like the other guy in here who heard tacet on Somafm's groovsalad I HAD to have this album. I was expecting a lot more ""tacet-style"", and I found myself skipping just about every track till I got to it. Maybe I misunderstood and was expecting more of a downtempo vibe but it turned out to be completely different.This CD just reminds me why I stopped liking hip hop. The rest of the album features so-so hip hop artists from the Orlando area. ""Funny"" Filler skits, cliche and boring lyrics, ""im a better rapper than you because"" analogical lyrics, etc. If I knew it was this type of album it still would've recieved two stars... Sorry beef"
3,Cute game for toddlers.,"Like most Haba toys, this one is very well made. My 3 year old likes playing with the wooden princess and bedding as much or more than playing the game. FYI: The bed is heavy cardboard, not wood. The price is a bit high, but at least it wasn't made in China!"
3,"Cute game, but....","This is a cute game, but a little boring for older kids, and the little ones end up just playing with the pillows and the little wooden princess.....but hey, nothing wrong with that! Overall, a nice little game, but nothing to get crazy about."
3,"Love Haba, but a bit disappointed.",We bought this for my daughter's St. Patrick's Day Birthday and have not yet played it because the bed would not stay together... The kids have since played with many of the pieces and lost the princess AND the pea... so I am wondering if we will ever play it...Just sad that the bed wasn't staying together. Looks like an adorable game... but it's been 9 months and we haven't been able to play it because the bed was such as issue. The rest of our Haba games have been amazing... so bummed about this one! Hopefully other customers have had better luck.
3,Simple First Game for Toddlers,"Like all HABA toys, the pieces are beautiful and whimsical. As a game, it works well as a tool for kids to learn patience and play cooperatively. I love that my two toddlers can and want to play this by themselves. But, it is not a game they want to pull out and play over and over like some others. This is not a must have on your game shelf but if you want something that the kids will play with together that an adult does not need to help with, it's a good choice."
5,Smells wonderful!!!,This shampoo smells really good and is concentrated so just a little bit of it applied to my poodle and labradoodle leaves them clean and fresh. I highly recommend the gallon size as you will save a lot more. Highly recommended!!!
5,Great,"Great shampoo, leaves fur smell good for a long time and not course like some shampoos do. Very lathery and rises well!"
5,great discovery!,"This is yet another one of those ""how did I miss this?"" albums. Great stuff that somehow slipped through the musical cracks. Thanks to Bear Family for a great reissue. I had never would have heard about this if it wasn't for a mention in MOJO magazine last year. Sounded intriguing, so I took a chance on it, before ever hearing a single song. This definitely exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be mostly country or folk, by Jim Ford crosses all sorts of musical genres, even dipping into soul/R&B (a couple of great tunes with Bobby Womack) and pop (one song that Nick Lowe later covered). Several songs that coulda/shoulda been hits. All in all, a very interesting collection. I opted for this over getting the ""Harlan County"" album reissue (all of which, I believe, is included here) and I'm glad I did. Some classic tunes here."
3,It's aight,It worked better on the front 3 but I have a 3800 series and it did nothing really for the rear. But it's an okay product
2,Broke during first use,"Well I was using this for the first time yesterday extracting the plastic neck of a transmission filter from its rubber seat and it broke where the shaft meets the handle. Now it's loose there and I don't know whether it will break off. So, since I bought it back in July and can't return it, I'll try epoxy glue before using it again. It might be okay just for pulling spark plug boots; but, if you use it for anything else better not put sideways force on it."
4,Spark plug boot puller,This puller works as advertised. Its narrow enough to get down to the base of the plug boot in heads that have recessed plugs. If you are buying this to reach the plug boots on a GM 3.8 (3800) this will work with some modification as well as the engine moving tool to rock the engine forward. However there is a purpose built tool for this particular engine for pulling stuck boots off cylinders 2 and 4.
3,Does work on my xTerra,Got this mainly to try to get boot off of back plug on my wife's V-6 xTerra. Too short to get down to the bottom of the plug. If you have an OHC engine with the plugs deeply recessed. This tool isn't. Does fine on my 2005 V-8 Silverado though.
5,My favorite cookbook!,"I bought this cookbook just before I got married, and it is a resource that I have reached for again and again. The recipes are quick, delicious, and usually require ingredients that you already have in the kitchen. (No miso paste here.) The main dish entrees focus on lean meats, poultry, and fish with light but flavorful sauces. Almost every recipe I've tried out of the book (and I've tried most of them) has come out a winner, with minimal time and effort on my part. This cookbook is truly one of the trusty standbys of my kitchen."
2,only a handful of good recipes,"Fortunately I bought it used so I didn't spend too much money. My husband hated the food, and many nights we just ended up throwing it out and getting take out.. not too healthy.I like to cook my way through cookbooks, and I follow the recipes exactly, but every meal was so bland and not even that healthy. The only recipes that I actually hang on to are the bread ones, and none of them are 100% whole wheat.I am still looking for a healthy cookbook, if anyone has a suggestion... please let me know.As for this one... I'll donate it."
4,Pleased.....,"I am really pleased with my new cookbook. Now, I have only tried a few meals and gotta say, the first two were great my kids loved them. One of them didn't turn out well at all, but that could be my fault. The thing that I love the most is that you get more information on different things like, the difference in different fish, onion, etc. Lots of tips! It's great! I have turned to this book alot."
2,Gold is Yellow,"I work in a photo processing lab, and print around 100 rolls of film each day.One thing I've noticed about Kodak Gold is that in general the ""gold"" tone the film tries to produce acts more like a yellow hue so that skin tones are distorted and subjects look jaundiced. Try Fuji, it's both cheaper and has better color."
2,Avoid,"Kodak Gold is a cheap color print film, and it shows.This is a horrible film for nature photography. Greens are dull, usually faded or washed out. Yellow off-color is common.To me, the film comes off as contrasty and lacking saturation (two things you don't want together). Color is anything but vivid.As a plus, skin color is usually acceptable in sunlight. Indoors, color drifts. Grain is usually acceptable, better some. Other than that, it's cheap. Those are the only positives I've seen with this film.I've had much better results shooting Fuji Superia. It's a better film in effectively every regard -- better color, better contrast, and is also cheap. Superia tends to favor cool colors, so may drift blue rather than yellow..I am an amateur photographer, so I'm likely more critical about what I use than most. Here's my flickr: flickr.com/photos/thtroyer/ Almost all of my photos are labeled with what camera/lens/film they were shot with."
2,disappointed in product's use by date!,Very disappointed to receive film with only 41/2 months use by date. ( to be developed by 06/30/13) four rolls are morethan I use in time given. Use be date should be at least a year in future.
3,Mixed feelings,"When the film arrived, the boxes had been cut open and the expiration date removed. I was told by the vendor that they had removed Target coupons to redeem to keep the price low. They did not adequately explain the missing expiration dates. The film was a gift for my father. I hope it works out."
2,Value,"200x film is just not very versatile. The Kodak quality pales in comparison to the cheaper 800x Fujifilm 4-pack, which gives chrystal clear pictures in most environments and is therefore highly versatile. Don't waste your money on Kodak."
5,Crystal Star,This book is in a Trilogy of seafaring books...I read all 3 and they will make you go through all the emotions and some you never knew you had...
3,gamekeeper,"a nice gamekeeper , but not what i search for it, i prefer just organizerfor the game like cd organizer"
3,"Chilton's Repair and Tune Up Guide, Volkswagen 1970 to 1981","This manual is of value to the do-it your selfer. I found this book useful in many areas. Chapter 4 on emission controls is well written, with lots of handy diagrams. Chapter 5 on the electrical system was not very detailed. When it comes to those nasty electrical problems, you might be left in the dark looking for that bad wire. In general it's a good book for the VW mechanic's library."
4,Brief but helpful,This Chilton guide is not as comprehensive as others we have had but it is still a great tool to keep in the glove compartment.
3,Greasey Greasey,"Everything went very well, it was just the book had so much grease on it I had a hard time reading some of the articles in it."
2,"Good Spatula, Horrible Handle","Durable blue silicone really does the job of scraping every last bit out of your mixing bowls. Unfortunately, it feels like you're holding a wire coat hanger. The handle is beautiful in its design, but uncomfortable-at-best in it's execution.If you usually whisk your creations with loose wiring, the handle shouldn't be a bother! But if you prefer something you can actually hold onto, you should look elsewhere."
3,ON TIME,"I HAVEN'T USE IT YET,I BOUGHT IT FOR SEND TO MY SISTER. BUT SEND TO ME ON TIME ,IT LOOKS GOOD!"
4,Useful,"This is a useful book, with some good tips. The photos are a bit old fashion, but the messages are good ones."
3,Too Critical - Offers little suggestions for improvement,"This is one of those books that cuts down everything you see in handgun training, but offers little in the way of improvements. I did not get a lot of constructive information out of this book, but rather a lot of what is wrong, but little on how to fix it. I read the book twice, and gave it away."
1,Worthless,"I was thrown by the title. It talks very little about actual defensive shooting and it doesn't take a critical look at current training methods, it just complains about all of them. If you pay more than a dollar for this book, you wasted your money."
5,Greatest Goldman CD ever heared,"I'm a real fan of Goldman, I have many CD-s with him, but this one is the greatest I ever heard. I was looking for this CD for a long time but I didn't find it anywhere. Finally I have found it on this site, so I was glad to purchase it immediately. Thanks Amazon!"
4,a real look at Vegas!,"I've seen many Las Vegas travel videos over the years but none as complete as this one. Historical footage was like watching a documentary on cable! All the casinos are represented with recent footage and up to date looks at one of the more exiting cities in the world, besides London!"
3,2 AAA,"Charger works great for AA batteries, but it can only charge 2 AAA batteries at a time, which is a real pain in the neck!"
5,Another great one from Lucy,"I've enjoyed all of Lucy's albums, but especially Ten Year Night and Every Single Day. This one is right up there with those. Once again, Lucy combines catchy melodies, deep lyrics and great cover selections. For the first time, however, there is a common theme to the album, which reflects on how we are all connected. The city of New York becomes a key character in the album as well.This is a very consistent album. Highlights for me include the great Love Song/New York, the haunting post-September 11 song Land of the Living, and the wonderful, touching title song.This is a great CD, and destined to be one of my very favorites."
5,Lucy is in the Sky with Diamonds,"Beautiful! Lucy's latest CD ""The Red Thread"" is an emotional gem. What a storyteller, Land of the Living, I Had Something, The Red Thread, This is Home, etc. they will make you think, they will make you sing. As any Lucy fan will testify, buy any Lucy CD and you will end up with the collection. Thanks Lucy."
3,okay,The product was more or less what I expected. Adequately serves my purpose. My only negative comment is that it would have been easier to assemble if the pieces had been marked with numbers or letters.
3,What to say,"My sister died of lung cancer, this didn't help her, but she was in advanced stages, so I don't know how this tea would have helped earlier in her treatments. But this is not a stand alone product, the whole treatment must be implemented to see results, and I believe it works for some people."
3,A little scary,"You have to be very careful & very serious about what you are trying to do with this product. One of my dogs was diagnosed with a type of cancer this product might help but please be careful as side effects are definitely something you need to be aware of. Ended up not using it because was afraid of the side effects involved. However, the good news is my dog did not develop cancer again anyway."
1,This thing will break!,"I purchased this unit and went to install it on my roof. I started to get fairly good reception, but then as I was tacking the unit to the roof the connector came apart. I notice someone else here said the same thing. There is really no way to fix it, and I cannot believe how poorly built it is. I'm going to look at a different brand next time around. What a waste of money..."
5,Heater Control assembly,"My product arrived in a timely manner. Perfect condition. Exactly what I ordered. Unfortunately, it wasn't what was wrong with my air conditioner....but it WAS exactly what I had ordered."
3,"GOOD,BUT NOT GREAT","This is a good CD holder if you don't have many cd's.It's supposed to hold 10 cd's and it dosen't really do good at that anyway.When you close it,sometimes a cd gets stuck between the top and bottom,and is hard to close.Ok,but not for someone with lots of cd's."
1,garbage,"This phone is garbage. Garbage! My particular phone alternated between a low buzzing and a really loud buzzing. And, to boot, the cord gets completely tangled because it is coiled and so long. You'll spend 10 seconds untangling the thing every time someone calls. It's lightweight, alright, so if you're looking for a lightweight phone with a loud buzzing that tangles, this is your man."
3,"Great portability, but has its drawbacks.","For its size, this phone has many features, including tone/pulse switch, two setting volume control, redial and flash. The long cord on both the base and the earpiece is a double edged sword. On one hand, it's great to have all that room to move around. On the other hand, even with the base cord being coiled, it has a tendency to get in the way. And it isn't modular; the base cord is attached to the machine so you couldn't replace it with a shorter cord even if you wanted to. The biggest drawback, however, is the amount of background noise it creates. I've owned cheaper phones that had less buzzing than this one has. If you can put up with the background noise, it's an okay little phone."
2,Modern/Not for everyone,"The playing and recording are fantastic, as is most of what I've heard from the Emerson string quartet, in this fairly unapproachable music- if you are a fan of almost unstructured sound, this may be for you, I will stick with Stravinsky,Glass,Rasmussen,Harris,Hanson,Piston and some others, who at least have some structure in the composition, not just making noise with their instruments- I guess this is not for me, I probably can not appreciated it. I would love to get a musician comment on these works."
1,Don't be mislead,"While the one song that is sung is truly beautiful and spiritual, I was very disappointed that there was only ONE song, repeated again and again. I suppose for certain meditations it would be fine, but for my money, I was expecting perhaps four or five songs."
5,Transformational Music,"Make Me An Instrument is not only a beautiful musical performance, it can also be a transformational experience. Several years ago, while singing it in meditation with a group, I had one of the most amazing spiritual experiences of me life. I believe that this music, and the prayer it contains, can heal and awaken."
1,Does the 24 Volt vibrate like the 36 Volt Model?,"I bought the 36volt version of this saw and it vibrates so firecely it makes my nose itch!! More seriously, after ten minutes of continuous use I have to stop because it hurts my hands. I contacted Bosch and they said the vibration was normal. Does the 24 volt vibrate as intensely? My Milwaukie corded recip saw is super smooth, so I am using it and putting the Bosch cordless up for sale on EBAY."
3,Holds magazines OK but is a pig to get on and off,This holds magazines fine and has a adjustment screw for the tension.What lets it down are the two poppers which fix it to the belt. They are so hard to pop on and off it takes considerable effort and contortion to mount it on your belt.
5,guess???,"it's a classic watch, the numbers are very clear to my eyes, and the leather is very nice..a beautiful item."
4,White Nights - hot dance in Soviet Russia!,"A movie with ballet - but not a ballet movie! The opening scene showing Mikhail Baryshnikov's mind-blowing dance piece against turbulent orchestral music sets the scene for a serious, complex movie. He plays Nikolai Rochenko, a Russian deserter who defected to America but crash-lands back in the Motherland (some of the best air-crash footage I've ever seen).Stuck back in communist Soviet Union, he tries to escape back to the USA but is thwarted by Colonel Chaiko and a bugged apartment. Enlisting the help of Gregory Hines (who is amazingly radiant in this movie) and Nikolai's ex-girlfriend Galina (played by a wonderful Helen Mirren), together they try to escape during the sun-lit night of a Russian Summer. This movie was also Isabella Rossellini's first dramatic role and she is sublime as Raymond's Russian wife.This movie will not disappoint - with drama, suspense and some of the best dance moves on film, it is a wonderfully satisfying film."
5,Incredible,"This is the first review I have ever written, that is how strongly I feel about this movie. I first watched this movie in the theater when I was 15. I must have watched it 5 times alltogether. I was mesmorized by the dance sequences. I didn't know how mere mortals could soar and spin even though ""this is not ice skating"". The story was also gripping and compelling. I have waited for so long for this to come out on DVD and it's finally here. I also thought it had an incredible soundtrack. A must see."
5,Fantastic movie :-),"I remember seeing this at the theatre so many years ago and even as a kid, I knew I loved it. I have always loved dance and so this back then was a main draw for me. But now as an adult, I can really truly appreciate the talent of Mikhail Baryshnikov ('Koyla') and Gregory Hines (Raymond). These guys are/were legends.As a kid, I didn't understand/care for the political side of the movie (why they wanted to get out of Russia), but I get it now and it makes the story so much more than about dance only. It is such a great film, that while dated now, is still very enjoyable and great to re-watch again and show to younger people as well to see these genius' dance together. I can't wait to throw away my VHS copy and replace it by this long awaited DVD edition."
4,Still worth watching...,"I saw this movie again (after 16 years) with my Russian girl friend. Amazing that only a very few actually could speak Russian. Several so called Russians in this movie had such a bad foreign accent that she could hardly understand anything what they were saying... I guess back in those days in the cold war (1985) it was hard finding really good Russian actors.In any case, I have always liked the tension in this movie, the struggle to be free and the dancing as a way to demonstrate all the forbidden thoughts and feelings. Baryshnikov and Hines were great dancing partners. Actually, just the dancing alone is worth watching this movie.As a curiosity, I can add that the end scene (will not go into details here) seems to have been more or less copied in the latest James Bond movie."
3,DANCING is what it's all about,"Mikhail is completely amazing. Not only is he the most incredible dancer I have ever seen, he is also a very fine actor. The plot of the movie isn't too entertaining, and the constant plugging of the Acadamey Award nomminated songs becomes quite draining, but one look at the talent Mikhail posesses in his pinky finger and all the corny, poorly written dialogue doesn't matter so much. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Gregory Hines bets his last eleven or so ruples that Baryshnikov can't do eleven straight piroettes . . . well guess what. What a tribute to the amazingness of human ability, that's all I can say. Watch this movie if only to expand your knowledge of what true beauty is."
3,It was great when I saw it in high school...,"I recently saw this again and sheesh.... it's all about perception. This film is very 80s...very very very '80s. Seeing Mikhail Baryshnikov dancing in tights was worth the experience of the rest of the movie when I saw this back in the carefree days of high school.Great and convincing acting by Isabella Rossellini, Helen Mirren and Gregory Hines don't save this from being what seems in this day and time to be a ridiculous story. It's easy to forget what a threat the Soviet Union was at the time... and how scary the thought of being trapped in communist Russia really was... neighbor spying on neighbor, eavesdropping equipment everywhere and just cold, dreary days one after another. This is a film best enjoyed by folks who can remember what it was like be around in the 80s w/ the fear of nuclear war. This is hardly a ""timeless"" piece, but still enjoyable."
2,It Is All In The Dance,"Great dancing, fair acting, slow plot. The dance during the opening credits was the best part of the film for me."
2,very average at best,"Baryshnikov is a fantastic dancer.same goes for Gregory Hines.but this is a Buddy,Buddy Dance Movie? what a waste.it's not much of a film.but you have two of The Greatest Dancers that the World has ever seen.thank goodness their wasn't a follow up."
1,Bite the Ballet,"I guess Baryshnikov was trying to switch from the world of Ballet to the world of Hollywood movies with this effort. But then everyone realised that all he could play was surly, prima donna Russian ballet-dancers, so they had to put the rest of his career on ice. I would at least have liked to se him make an appearance as a ballet-kicking bad guy in one of the 80s Bond movies. Unless you take your ballet very seriously or have got a thing about bulges in tights, this movie will come over as a load of dated, Cold War ballet hoo."
1,Ballet Hoo,"A movie about ballet dancers - yawn! Not much for the guys here, plus it's questionable how attractive to ladies a leading man can be whose main interest is wearing stockings and prancing around on tip toe. Baryshnikov isn't even good-looking with his surly face. As for the tortured artist angle, we all know that ballet dancers were among the few classes spoilt by the corrupt Soviet system. The plots as thin as Bary's stockings. Anyway, that whole Cold War thing is pretty much outdated and passe nowadays."
4,"So realistic, it's scary...","I really enjoyed this movie, i just happened to stroll upon it while i was watching television. However I was unable to find the title of it unitl many hours on the web searching! I am trying to build a DVD collection so i will hold off on getting this movie until its is on that format, however this is surely a movie that deserves DVD quality! If you like movies about other government, this is one that could keep your attention and at the edge of your seat wondering what the main character is going to do next...."
5,Holds up well,I was afraid the story would seem dated. It holds up well.Baryshnikov's dancing is amazing. Worth the money ++
4,fast delivery,"this DVD was sent out quickly after my ordering it. i received it within a week, always a pleasant outcome"
3,The most beautiful first 5 minutes of cinema you'll ever see,"Dated, yes....but I bought it because of the first five minutes, when Misha dances a ballet of utmost beauty...if the whole rest of the plot is dated and silly, those first five minutes or so will leave you breathless, as it's a tribute to the beauty of Baryshnikov as a dancer. Typical cold war, Russians vs. US plot, with a few more memorable sequences of Misha and Gregory Hines doing their thing, both exceptional talents. Buy it for the dance sequences, forget the storyline, and I think you'll be satisfied."
5,Enjoyable.,"Really good performances of those little Dvorak gems. Well played, with excellent balance and the typicalbeautiful tones from the Wiener Philharmoniker. The best alternative to get the two serenades in one album."
1,Not very useful,"I don't find this to be that useful. The only benefit is that it holds the iPod upright (it has a line out feature, but that's not why I purchased it and I won't use that). I assumed (incorrectly) that it came with it's own power cord, so that it would, by itself, charge the iPod. You must purchase a separate plug or use the USB jack that it came with. I wanted an addition means of charging the nano. Had I known that it was just a base, I wouldn't have purchased this item, certainly not for $30. For me, the utility of this isn't worth more than a few bucks, and I'm not exactly the miser type."
2,Wish I had done more research,"Yeah, the Nano Dock is useful; however, be aware that it comes with NO cords whatsoever. This means that you have to purchase yet another accessory for it to be of any practical use. BOO Apple! There is absolutely no excuse for following in the footsteps of Microsoft!"
5,Makes your iPod SING!,"I gotta say, this tiny little dock is amazing... it makes it SO EASY to hook your new Nano to just about anything that will receive a stereo mini jack. I tried it at the Apple store at the local mall before I bought it at Amazon. They had it connected to a variety of computers, speakers, and other media devices. It's fantastic how this tiny interface increased the flexibility and usefulness of the newest addition to the iPod family. It's SO COOL! Get one! At this price, buy two!"
1,For $30 it was over priced,I agree with the comment below. I was under the assumption as the previous reviewer. I would pay about $5 with no shipping but no more. It basically is more cosmetic than productive.
5,Just like I remembered,"I had one of these when the nano first came out. Now here we are years later and I just bought another 1G nano for its classic lines. Well of course I had since disposed of my last nano dock because each generation has cleverly dooped me so I have since stopped buying them after my first ipod. If you want a dock specifically built for the 1G, this is your product at an incredible price!"
2,No Cord Included - Pretty Useless,"I misplaced my ipod cord and thought this dock would come with one, but its just the dock without the cord. The only thing it's useful for is having the Nano docked and stand in it as opposed to laying it down while charging. In terms of utility value, I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this thing. I'm surprised they got away with a $29.99 retail value. I guess you're paying for the name."
4,Good Product,I bought this one because it'd keep my space look nice and clean.pro: gain mobility of your ipodcon: limit to 1st gen ipod only
2,Not Necessary component,"This is just not needed for your Ipod...there are so many other great docking items out there such as speakers,alarm clocks etc we have never used it! It was a waste of money!"
3,Doesn't Fit 2nd Generation iPod Nano,"I was a little disappointed when I got the 2nd generation iPod Nano and the 1st generation dock and it didn't fit. So, I got my Milwaukee Hole Shooter drill out and took care of the situation. I would have appreciated a red flag or something... Otherwise, the transaction was smooth."
3,"Mediocre, at best","This probably would have been a better Deathlands back in the day.But now, with better writers penning this series, the bar has been raised a bit. And could do with more!I just wished that either Victor Milan or Nick Polatta would take over this series, altogether. Even this Alan Philipson, fellow. Any of these writers can - and do! - a much better job than this guy, or Andy Boot, the worst of the lot by far!The muties here were terrible. Man, ya gotta have cool ass muties!The overall story is typical."
1,Not what I expected,"When I got the film , the package was already opened, and the film was falling out of the package. The UPC and the expiration date were cut off, probably because the film is outdated. Definitely NOT worth the money!"
2,"Get the Royal Gold 400 film, not this one",Skip this one and get either: Kodak Royal Gold 400 or Fuji Superia 400. If you settle for this film you are going to possibly compromise your photo shot.
2,Style gets in the way of substance,"This should really be called Nana (instead of Ming Ming) because that's the name of the other of the two characters Zhou Xun plays; the one who has the orange hair, quite a bit more screen time, and a better story line if you could separate them. This is NOT a martial arts film unless you consider flinging marbles and flicking matches at people martial arts. I thought it was silly. Director Susie Au obviously comes from a music video background. I found the random quick and quirky edits tiring, although they did set up the actors with wonderfully posed portraits throughout. Daniel Wu has an awesome hairdo if you go for that kind of thing. Zhou Xun's Cantonese is quite fetching and ordinarily I could watch her all day long. She's one of the more engaging actresses from China. (See her in ""The Equation of Love and Death"" or ""Painted Skin"") It's too bad that the director's heavy-handed style gets in the way of enjoying this film where identity is an ambiguous thing."
5,Great analysis of corporate/government propaganda,"Chomsky does a masterful job of analyzing the development of propaganda as used by corporations,the government and the media. The book is concise, extremely interesting and well thought out. If you have never read Chomsky, be prepared to read into the mind of a genius. Great stuff. He charts the history of propaganda and makes sense of government and corporate actions that on the surface don't make sense. A must read."
5,TRULY EYE-OPENING AND ENGAGING!!,"An exceptional read. The subject is one which does not get touched upon enough in the media (but why would it?) It is a clearly written and engaging book. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. In fact, I am buying a few dozen to to pass out. Few books have been able to notably shift my perspective...this one has. Read it."
5,In a word - Fantastic!,"David McLauchlan is a fantastic musician, with a musical talent that is rarely seen (or should I say, heard?). The power and emotion that he conveys seems effortless... His original works on the album are haunting, moving, and utterly enchanting. And I can honestly say that his interpretations of popular songs truly do them justice, which is a rarity these days. This album is perfect to listen to most any time, and is one that you can set on repeat, and never turn off! Seldom do I recommend an album to EVERY person that I know, but this is most definitely one that I can. If you enjoy good music, you would be doing yourself a disservice to not give this one a try. Two enthusiastic thumbs up - way up."
1,Greatest Salsa Classics,I have tried repeatedly to download this to my computer and I cannot do it. I have already paid in full. Pls help.
2,Full of name dropping,"This book is taking me forever to get through. It IS very interesting, but it is less about teaching the art of interviewing and more about all the examples that the author has experienced. I was hoping for an instructional book, which it is, but you have to dig through tons of expamples and stories to get to the real lessons. Sometimes the examples are very helpful and other times they seem to be there just to prove that the author knows famous people. This is not the best way to learn how to interview. It's more about the experiences of a professional."
5,"Great bike, good value.",This is a nice bike for such a small price. My 17 year old son assembled it in about 15 minutes and has been riding it to work everyday for over a month now and loves it. I highly recommend this bike.
1,waste of money,"Box dosen't latch or lock while closed and shells have way to much wiggle room inside, so if your interested in a good ammo box keep looking because this one comes up short."
5,great Christmas book,"This book, by the crative genious of Tomie dePaola, really is a wonderful read for the Christmas season. The story is the legend of how panetonne, the Italian Christmas bread, was created by a baker in Italy.Resplendent with dePaola's signature style drawings and a good, readable text, this book will be one we'll go to every year for Christmas -- and of course, make panetonne for the family afterwards!"
5,A Personal Favorite,"I received this as a gift from a family friend when I was a kid, and it has been my favorite ever since. I still have the original copy, though I plan to order more for each of my brothers' families. As a 21-year-old student majoring in Italian, this is one of my most prized childhood possessions, a book I still read to myself from time to time. I couldn't wait until my nephew was old enough to read it with me, and he loves it just as much as I do."
5,Great Com+ book I ever read,"I've tried some many COM books and this is the best I've read so far. The book provided simple, yet useful examples and also has advanced and real-world projects. I've benefited a lot from reading it. I've read this book twice, and each time I learnt something more... I highly recommend this book to all who wants to have a in depth understanding of COM."
5,Engaging and emotionally appealing,"Dee Carstensen is an artist whose warmth and sensitivity is as evident in her recordings as in her personal appearances. Her music seems to evoke emotion and she connects with her listening audience. As with all great storytellers, Dee translates personal experience into songs for all of us. This album begins with Time - a story about Dee's Aunt - that immediately engages the listener. Dee's voice is a gentle and sweet as the instrument she plays."
3,Great coloring book....,"KNOTWORK AND SPIRALS by Courtney Davis is a great way to introduce kids to the intricacies of Celtic design. While historical accuracy is not Davis' specialty, the author captures the spirit if not the intent of these designs. Call it artistic license.The book is filled with examples of knotwork borders, medallions, and other elements used to illustrate the beautiful books painstakingly copied by Christian monks--like the Book of Kells--as well as other church artifacts. Davis shares some insights into the symbology or supposed symbology of some designs, such as the center of the spiral as the 'motionless mover' (God) with flows of energy as spirals around the center.Davis includes a number of designs of his own creation, built up as he says from doodles. There are many pages of knots and spirals for coloring, so the book makes a nice workbook for children with an artistic bent."
4,What I was looking for.,"I've bought several books with Celtic knots and spirals hoping to learn how to make them myself. If that's your goal, this isn't the book. If you're looking for knots and spirals that can be copied and colored, a ""coloring book"" so to speak, this is what you've been looking for. The designs are big and very soothing to color."
3,Missing & defaced pages,"I was shocked to find pg 31/32 had been cut out of the book ( not just missing but cut out) and designs number 1, 2, & 4 ,and the corresponding designs on the reverse of the page, cut out of the page that would have faced of 32. There was no errata slip to explain the defacement. The remainder of the book had some nice designs in it."
2,Too expensive- not what I expected!,"Too expensive at $90 and it is not what I expected. I think you could make a much better system for less money. I would not recommend buying, the turn buckle is very cheap along with the main assembly."
1,Undecided,"We still have not put this item up in the backyard yet. The quality of the piece is flimsy. Not worth the money. The handle is plastic, and the cable is thin. We may return the item. We are still deciding."
3,Need more information on purchase,This seemed to be well put together and would do the job fine except it was not stated anyware that I saw as to the weight the zip line was for. Rated at only 100 pounds was not enough of a weight limit for this child. This information should be published in the advertisment.
2,critical part unusable (turnbuckle),"The turnbuckle part, on one end, was difficult to turn much without great force using tools. It should be able to turn manually prior to assembly with other parts. Even after attempting to extend with tools, it still could not be fully extended. The metal/iron appears to be of very low quality material, and the finishing/machining was also very low quality. I'll need to buy an equivelent high quality part. Other parts were OK. Given the price of the toy, the intended use outdoors with children, and what was actually provided, I expected it should all be high to medium quality. The turnbuckle was of such low quality to the point it is unusable.A friend bought this toy earlier and did not report these problems to us, and were happy with it. I saw him manually tighten the turnbuckle on his without a problem. Maybe a parts supplier changed recently.UPDATE: Called SpringSwings and they sent a replacement quickly. This turnbuckle works as expected."
4,Enjoying the ride,We are enjoying our Fun Ride. The neighborhood children come over and also enjoy it. Be sure to pad the landing area. We put mule tape through the handle and made a loop for the children to sit in. Not sure if it is as safe with the tape.
3,needs metal wheels instead of plastic,"This worked super for about a week and then the wheels inside the housing ""burnt out"". The edges of the wheels bent and the wire wouldn't stay in the wheel track. Had to go buy some metal replacement wheels. The size of the new metal wheels isn't quite right but we can make do. I admit my kids are rough and used this incessantly but they are in the weight range specified for this product."
5,AWESOME TOY,I don't understand how some have said this is a hard set up. There is more than enough cable to hang and the set up MAYBE took 20 minutes including gathering some tools and walking to my backyard. My boys love it!! It is rated for 100 pounds or less so be aware of that but otherwise 2 thumbs up.
3,This Product is NOT 70' Long,"Some of the other reviews for this product are referring to the other product by Spring Swings, so be sure you want this light duty, short span product (30 or 35' I think). I mistakenly ordered this based on the reviews and now have to pay to return it. I thought I was ordering the longer one. Just wanted to give others the warning so they can choose this on an informed basis. Not sure how it works yet, still waiting for the Super Fun Ride (the 100' model) to arrive. Looks fun though !"
5,Fun Gift for my Nephews,"My order arrived on time and in good condition. My nephews (ages 6 and 8) are really enjoying their Trolley ride, and my brother-in-law did not have any trouble setting up the trolley."
3,Bike is too large for small women,I am 5' 2'' and purchased this bike. It is way to big for me. I lowered the handle bars and seat in the lowest position and my tip toes barely touch the ground. I am returning this bike.
5,Great CD For Anyone Who Loves Guitar,"""Axe To Grind"" by Christian Nesmith is one of the most fantastic guitatists today. This album is for anyone who love King's X or Steve Vai (and yes his dad Papa Nez). Christian is in a league of his own such as other greats as Reeves Gabrels, Buckethead, and Paul Leary (Buutthole Surfers). Christian is the next Papa Nez in my opinion no respect to Michael. Break Up, Break Down is a great opener track, it has a very Kng's X feel. Wich is not a bad thing for anyone who loves King's X. Buggin' is a great instrumantal among others such as Blister, and smash and grab. The closing track is I Am The Walrus a great cover of The Beatles classic. I recomend this CD for anyone who is looking for a great guitar hero, or another great guitar hero."
2,It looks like it's been run over by a truck,The packaging of this battery arrived intact but it was all smashed flat and covered in dirt. It looks just like it was lying on a street for a few days while trucks ran over it. What's with this company???
1,A shameless cash in.,"This product's name is misleading, there was nothing even similar to it featured in the movie 'Superman Returns'. Lex Luthor never wears 'Kryptonite Armor' in this or any other movie. The very idea of Kryptonite Armor is ridiculous. The last time I checked, Kryptonite was radioactive and extremely dangerous to be around, let alone wear as a suit of armor!This is exactly the kind of poorly thought out cash-in toy that should be discouraged. it's bad enough that studios force scenes into mvoies to be able to sell mroe toys, but to amke up scenes that weren't even in the movie? That's just plain silly."
2,Mother Divine review,"The album was touted as healing and soothing and very helpful to it's listeners. The song was very pretty. But listening to it repeatedly did not relax me at all. A couple of times was OK, but after that it became boring and the repetitions annoying. Sorry. I would not recommend this album."
2,OK I guess,"I got this cd because Cheryl Richardson in her book Extreme Self Care said to get it. My library didn't have it and neither did just about any other library. So I paid the big bucks and bought it. I played it the other day. The kids liked it. I just don't get it. Maybe if I took the time to listen to the words, I dunno."
2,the sample isn't representative,"In the sample, there was lovely harp accompaniment. After the first 30 seconds of the cd, that disappeared and there was only chanting of Mother Divine repeatedly."
4,Feels nice but doesn't reduce static,"I bought this hairbrush last week. I have very thick, long hair, and winter static is a big problem for me. I was hoping to add a hairbrush to my static-reducing routine this winter and I decided on this one. It has arrived and so far I haven't noticed much difference over my old, cheap conair paddle brush. This one feels nice on the scalp, it is definitely a mini-massage, but I still get a lot of static when I brush my hair with it. It seems to be well-made. However, I don't like that it has so much text on the handle and a large design on the back of the paddle. It's a good quality brush but don't get it if your goal is to reduce static."
3,Ionic Paddle Brush,I bought this earlier this year and use it daily and the rounded tips on the teeth of the brush are falling off. This is my 2nd brush 3 years and I am disappointed. They work great about 6 months then start coming apart.
2,Ouch!,"Purchased brush after reading about it in a magazine article.Very disappointed.Brush was missing a bristle and hurts upon use.""Cushion"" ended up with some of my hair resting on it!"
3,"Nice brush, not good for very thick haiur","This is a beautiful brush to look at, and appears to be well make. However, I have very thick, dense, wavy hair, and this brush couldn't get much past the surface: it's way too soft to get anywhere near my scalp. I gave it my my neighbor's 8 year old, who has fine, not-too-thick hair, and she's delighted with it. I ordered the Ambassador Oval Oak Handle Hairbrush ([...]), a boar and nylon bristle brush, and it arrived today. Handle is smaller, and so isn't as comfortable in my hand as this one (I have large hands) but the bristles are much stiffer, it gets down to my scalp with ease, so the Ambassador is a much better choice for someone with my kind of hair."
5,Great brush,"my girlfriend loved it(5stars)makes your hair soft the first few brushes (5stars)makes your hair static (4stars)my girl would not shut up about how soft it is quotes: my hair feels so good, feels like clouds Great brushShipping FAST"
2,Good...at first,"I've had this brush for almost a year. A few months ago the plastic bristles started getting all bent out of shape, and then almost all of the tops of the bristles fell off. It hurt to brush my hair, and after a couple weeks the brush started doing actual damage to my hair. I finally took out scissors today and cut off all the plastic bristles so now it's just a boar bristle brush. Now it makes my hair soft again but it isn't exactly what I wanted in the brush... another brush I have (Goodys) I have had for 5 years and it's still great. Disappointed in this brush :("
4,Good small sized brush,"Was looking for the bristle brushes, but didn't want to spend a lot. This one works great. I particularly like the fact that it has both bristles and the plastic covered nubs."
5,Most comfortable brush,This brush has held up very well since I've purchased it. It feels really great on your scalp and gets the tangles out well. My mother loved it so much I'm going to have to buy her one as well!
3,"Well-made brush, but not right for my hair.","A lot of people swear by boar bristle brushes, and I thought I'd give one a shot. I like that this one has the longer bristles for detangling as well. Unfortunately, I think my hair is too fine for this type of brush; even being very gentle with totally dry hair, I was getting a lot of breakage that I don't normally have. The brush itself is solidly constructed, and it may be great for someone with coarser hair, but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone."
2,Don't waste your money,Was a good brush but completely falls apart after a few months of use! I would not buy this brush again
2,mamisalami,"I loved this product for a few months, then the plastic balls on the end of the bristles began falling off and it scrapes my scalp and is painful to brush my hair with. Disappointed at how long it lasted as I've never gotten so many compliments on my hair and it felt very healthy since using. If only it lasted. :("
3,"Nice brush, arrived with a few bristles missing","I bought this brush due to the high amount of good reviews. My item shipped quickly, however, it arrived with a few bristles missing (just an empty hole where a group of bristles should be) and the majority of the bristles seem to be jutting out to the right side of the brush? I'm assuming this is an isolated incident. I'll make the most of it!"
2,Olivia Garden Ionic and Boar Bristles Cushion Paddle Hair Brush,"I was not impressed with this brush. I found that it REALLY increases static, and the wood pins are way too flimsy. They won't brush all the way through my fairly thick hair. I have had bamboo brushes before that I've liked and was excited to find this combo brush. I was extremely disappointed when I tried it."
5,Great brush,This is a nice lightweight paddle brush that works very well getting tangles out of hair after washing. Attractive as well!
1,worst brush ever,Yikes this brush is horrible! I have long thick hair and it feels like I'm destroying my hair when I use this brush. I have large paddle brushes from the Dollar Store they are much better.
5,Lovely Brush - literally - it's a pretty brush,"I've been a Pearson brush fan, and I have even bought a Dollar Store brush out of curiosity. I now have this brush.Where has this brush been all my life? Why have I spent my money on a MP brush, when this is actually better.I think I will have it a long time. Quality Brush. The design is nice,and it's pretty to look at."
3,Great quality brush but a bit painful,"My daughters and I have very long hair. I really like bamboo products - and after reading reviews for the brush figured I would give this one a try. Aesthetically this brush is quite nice. Unfortunately, however, it really pulled and snagged on both my daughters hair, as well as mine (2 of us have thick hair and 1 has fine hair). I was a bit disappointed because I've been trying to find a good quality full size paddle brush that isn't too ""aggressive"" on the hair. I think the smaller ""paddle"" brush with the boar bristles would have been a far better option but we really needed the full size paddle."
2,Bristle tips break off easily,"The quality of the brush is good except that the nylon bristle tips break off easily and it scratches your scalp. I've only had it for a couple months and over half of them have come off as I've been brushing. I do have thick long hair, so it might be fine for other folks with shorter, thinner hair. I have since switched to another paddle brush that has 100% wood bristles."
3,Lightweight,"The brush is not as sturdy as I thought it might be, and one of the bristles was missing when I got it out of the box, but it does what it is supposed to do. This type of brush is great for quickly drying my below shoulder length hair."
3,Longing to Love it,"I had high hopes when ordering this brush. Sounded great with the combined bristles, pegs and cushion (a hard to find combination), however it is just not working for me. I have fine, but thicker hair. For some reason, it is unable to penetrate to my scalp especially when my hair is wet. If your hair is thin, it will probably work well for you, but sadly not me. I gave it three stars for having all the elements needed in a good brush."
3,Doesn't hurt... but broke after a couple months,"I have semi long hair that tangles easily and I absolutely loved this brush. Even my 4yo loved it. Unfortunately after a couple months, we lost some of the heads of the plastic bristles... making it pretty painful to brush. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Frayed and Weak,"The nylon bristles on this brush are very thin and do not even reach the scalp through my thin hair. I purchased this for my boyfriend who is growing out his thick hair, so it was absolutely useless. The boar bristles are too short and just skim over the top layer of hair. They were also frayed out like an old toothbrush when we received it. Overall, I prefer myConair Professional Full and Mid Size Nylon Cushion Brush Set, Colors may varyto this flimsy thing. It's lasted about 5 years now and is still stiff enough to brush my SO's thick hair thoroughly."
5,"Big ""Ups"" for seller ""words-and-music"" !!","Just received the CD ""Mandolins & Friends"" from the seller ""words-and-music"". The shipping was phenomenally fast...2 days from order to door!! Also, received a (unexpected) bonus sampler CD. It was a fantastic experience.As a side note, I've been looking for this CD for several years. I heard it while our band (The Rarely Herd) was recording a CD in Nashville in the '90's and Mark Howard, the mandolinist on this CD, was our recording engineer. He played it for us and I loved it. Really glad to own it now.This would be a GREAT CD to initiate anyone into the world of Acoustic/Bluegrass music. Clean and tasteful. And wonderfully played by Mark Howard et al. Thanks for the exceptional service and product!"
4,Bright headlight without the premium price,"Ok, this isn't a high-end head light for extended treks and climbing Everest. The build quality is a bit rough and the whole thing feels a little cheap. The light works well, has three light levels, and on the highest level is very bright. These things are so cheap that I bought several and keep them around the house (work on bike in garage, messing inside of computer cases, seeing laptop keyboard while watching TV...many fine geek pursuits). Couple of gotchas to be aware of: (1) putting in the batteries can be a little tricky -- squint at the markings to make sure they are going in the right way. (2) I found the headband to be a little tight at first and needed to stretch it out to make it comfortable. (3) The button is a little touchy and sometimes skips a level, so you may need to cycle through the levels a couple of times to land on the right one."
3,curious packaging,"Battery arrived loose in a zip loc bag; not the sealed Energizer packaging as shown. The battery works, but I have no way of knowing if it is new or a recharge. Good price, though"
5,Its a battery,"What can I say besides its a good battery and does what a battery does. As far as battery life it seems to last forever in my thermometer. Also, Amazon shipping was fast and reasonable."
1,"DO NOT by from ""Limited Goods"" company","The seal of the battery is opened. It is obviously in used condition. terrible service and horrible product. DO NOT BUY from ""Limited Goods""."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS VENDOR,"When I received the batteries, all packages were open. You could see the batteries were used. I tested them and nonet tested to full capacity.Since they were so inexpensive, I did not bother to send them back."
1,Very disappointed,"I am only giving this one star because the packing was very well done and the shipping was rather quick. However, I am sorely disappointed that these are not the item that they are listed to be. If you are looking for a Ball Jar BRAND jar mug... then you are at the wrong place. These are NOT Ball jars as they are listed, which is false advertising in my book. They are a cheap knock-off of a much more reliable brand. They are not well made at all, otherwise they could stand to be heated up at higher temperatures, like normal canning jars.However, if you want a more cost efficient way to satisfy your kitchen or party trends, feel free to order from these people. They are a fair price for the look you may want."
2,"I wish I had read the reviews. ""Ball"" brand is misleading","I was quite disappointed in these jars. I didn't read anything carefully when buying these. Amazon has 12 Libbey Country Fair 16-Ounce Drinking Jars for half the price, but I bought these because they were ""Ball"" branded. My other Ball drinking mugs say Ball right on the jar, so I didn't realize that plain means plain glass, so they dont look very good. Also there was a note in the box that says,""Not suitable for hot beverages."" I use my mugs in the microwave to make hot chocolate, but since these say they are not safe, I am afraid that they might explode. I wish I had read the reviews before jumping to buy these based on the brand name. One reviewer claims that these are knock-offs, and he might very well be right."
1,Check shipping charges from this company before ordering!,"I have not yet received the Ball mug drinking jars so have no comment on the product itself, but have just noticed the $14 charge for 'shipping and handling' charged to my card by Goodman's, nearly doubling my $14.99 purchase. Should I have caught it? Yes, technically it was my error not picking it up on the order confirmation, and had I seen it I would have canceled the item. Will I purchase from Amazon via this company again? No! I made an assumption about Amazon's 'free shipping', it cost me, I'm an unhappy and wiser consumer from now on. When your order comes via another vendor read your confirmation carefully!"
5,Made Great Gifts,"Used the mugs and did faux etching on them and gave two to couples, one with homemade hot cocoa in it and marshmallows, the other with peppermint vodka."
3,what's the deal with pat?,"so they get busted and pat's supposedly gone by that time - then they're sitting in jail, thinking they should give the cops pat's name and address. then, later on in jail, pat is now there - tied up with the whole crew! what's the deal? other than that, a good read"
3,Even odds on whether it's worth it.,"Despite the subtitle (""A True Tale of Love and the Vig"") I was plagued throughout my reading of this semi-confession of a former Ivy-leaguer's plummet into the world of bookmaking by a certain dubiousness. Alson's story is written in a kind of flippantly open manner that undermines the believability of his insider's story. Don't get me wrong, it's very entertaining and all, but his coyness about just how ""connected"" the small-time operation he was a part of was came across as rather disingenuous to me. While his confusion and despair about figuring out what he should be doing with his overeducated self hit the right notes, the subplot of the long distance sort of relationship was often more annoying than interesting. Still, not a bad little peek into bookmaking."
2,PARTIAL TRANQUILITY,"There are a lot of musical paths to tranquility and even many collections with tranquility in the title. This is not one of the better ones generally and not even one of the better with ""classical"" themes. Too many of the selected pieces are not among the most tranquil-evoking works; the choice of guitar arrangements was promising but unfortunately the playing style is so crisp and strident that you have to turn the volume down considerably to achieve any general sense of tranquility in the sounds. Omissions were obvious: no Pachabel's Canon, no Siegfried Idyll, no Peer Gynt, no Scheherazade themes, and only one of the three Gymnopodies. All these and more could have been included within the physical limitations of CDs if just a few of the marginally tranquil selections had been omitted. If you are seeking a path to consistently tranquil music CD , this disc should not be on it."
1,"Nice bowls, bad packing","When I ordered 4 of these bowls, to add to my Fiesta, I only received 2 in tact- the packing was so bad, two broke. Since I ordered 4 I was told they would replace 4 (free), even though I really only needed 2. When I got the next order 2 MORE of the bowls were broken. So I have my four- but to get four they had to send me 8. I'd say, but the Fiesta somewhere else, where they pack the dishes correctly.The bowls themselves are great- I'd give them 5 stars. The one star is for the shipping."
5,It's a small bowl,"Many reviewers were surprised to find out how small this bowl is. For an idea, a dove bar of soap fits into it nicely since it is about three inches at the base. That being said, I already knew what to expect since I already have several of them. I find them so useful and needed some more. They are great for holding snacks, as a soap dish, as a bowl to feed a small pet, as a saucer for a small plant. The colors are pretty too."
1,Not useful,"This week-end, my significant other asked me to help her with her Photoshop homework. (The class uses this book as its text.) Although I'm not a Photoshop professional, I've been using the software since Photoshop version 3.Although the authors are certainly expert Photoshop users, and have a vast knowledge of the product, the information was not conveyed in a consistent nor coherent fashion. Key steps were omitted, important concepts were not clearly explained, and exercises were not presented in a useful order. (The tasks you perform in step 3, for example, conflict with what you are asked to do in setp 5.)The experience with this book reminded me of that old joke, How to Carve and Elephant (""Start with a block of wood and carve away anything that doesn't look like an Elephant."")Unless you are well-versed in Photoshop, I would not recommend this book."
1,Limited,"I felt that the exercises in this book were too specific unto themselves and would have liked to have seen a broader perspective taken. For example, they show you how to create a very specific type of navigation bar. However, what if you want to create a tabbed navigation bar (like Amazon's), or a menu bar that doesn't rely on one of Photoshop's preset button ""styles"" for it's look? I think this is the kind of book where (hopefully) there is a specific project they've done that you can incororate into your own web site as is. If not, you're probably out of luck. The book doesn't teach you how to create navigation bars, it teaches you how to create their specific navigation bar. Too limited for my liking, but some will probably like the immediacy of the projects."
5,A 'must' for any owner of Photoshop CS2 who is serious about building the better web site,"Jan Kabili and Colin Smith's How To WOW: Photoshop CS2 For The Web is outstanding: it presents the in-depth tips from two professional graphic designer/trainers who have developed a method for combining quality, flexibility and speed with web graphic creation based on Photoshop CS2. Their program teaches all the fundamentals for building more effective sites, building upon basics to move to more advanced topics such as animation. A companion cd-rom disc includes all the original designs used in the project-building HOW TO WOW, along with styles, actions and pattern presets. A 'must' for any owner of Photoshop CS2 who is serious about building the better web site."
2,Not for professionals,"This book is not meant for professionals. The examples and projects in this book mostly look like someone who just started using Photoshop made them. Some directions in the don't match the images (one example in the ""Web Pattern Recipes"" section says ""choose a 3-pixel hard round tip"" and they used a 5-pixel brush for their example).I was hoping for the ins and outs of file types, best practices of optimizing, color tables, etc.. For building a website based on standards, this book is not going to help. It will help you build a site with billions (slight exaggeration) of hard to manage slices and table cells along with plenty of spacer gifs. About the only chapter I plan to fully read is the one on Automation."
4,Todd Richards Tips 1: Snowboarding Basics,"This was a great purchase. Probably the most well done and informative instructional DVD I've watched. Makes you want to get on the mountain! Recommend to anyone who wants to advance their snowboarding abilities. Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!"
4,I've read everything Molly and,"She's awesomely funny, direct and insightful. Molly Ivins has the unique perspective of following George W. Bush's career and writing about it since his Texas days. However, unlike many other writers with a political bent, that's not all she wants to talk about.Forget the ""reviewer"" below who said this book is communist drivel; obviously he or she didn't even read the book and makes the telling mistake of discussing the cover, as if it matters.In ""Nothin But Good Times Ahead"" everyone gets their due from Molly, including Bill and Hillary Clinton.She calls 'em as she sees 'em, taking no prisoners and making you laugh, cry and think. She ought to run for president!"
2,"Good, but not Great","Kondrashin was undoubtedly one of the greatest conductors of the 20th Century. His repertoire included Brahms, Beethoven, of course the Russians, and was known for his ability as an accompanist. This recording, live with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, is interesting if not one of his best performances. This series of releases on Philips, six in all, did not last long in the catalogue and was not especially well received by critics. I found them all worthy of owning, but unless you're a dedicated collector of Kondrashin's recordings, this is one of the lesser issues. I would recommend it at a fair price, but certainly not at the inflated prices you may find here and there. Save your cash--there are many better Eroicas and many better examples of Kondrashin's superb conducting and musicianship."
4,Ameristep High Back Chair,"A well made, portable, light weight, chair for use when photographing wildlife and nature. I purchased this chair to use in blinds when attempting to photograph birds and wild animals. It is sturdy (I am 6 Ft and 195 lbs) and light enough to fold up and carry most anywhere. I would give it 5 stars, but the front lip of the chair hits right on the hamstrings and can be a bit uncomfortable if you spend too much time in one position. Overall, well worth the price."
3,Not bad for the price,"This chair is pretty comfortable when teamed with a cushion. The strap is helpful but a little short and the chair is noisy when carrying. I solved the noise issue by simply wrapping a small bungee chord around the folded legs. I'm a pretty big guy (250lbs) and the chair held me without a problem. The only thing I'd like better is if the seat pivoted, other than that a good buy. I've only used it for two days and will revisit this review if it doesn't last."
4,Camo chair,Bought for husband to use in photo blind. Came in a timely manner and works as advertised.
3,It works,"Not to bad for the money, but take a small pillow or a thick towel to put over the seat. Your going to need it."
4,AAA,"use all the time-great chair,easy to carry and store-AAA we use these chairs for hunting small and compacked,great little chair."
2,Loud,"Not really that comfortable and daily loud. I would not recommend it in a blind where you are shooting fairly close (with my son, so I needed a 100 yards or less shot)."
4,Good product for a good price,"I use this for sitting in a hunting blind. i'm 5' 10', 175. Good size and comfortable for hour long stretches."
3,"Perfect, when it works",I'm an HVAC contactor. I use my tools often. I previously owned a porter cable cordless drill that performed flawlessly. The performance of the bosch tool has been exemplary. Lots of power and reasonable weight. The first gear on the cordless drill gave up after two months of use however. Now I have to take it to a local repair shop and live without it for a week. Even after they repair it I will question it's durablity. I would suggest that people looking at this kit strongly consider a dewalt.
4,Good Vacuum,"After having read all the other reviews of this product I decided to buy it. The two main draws were the ""low Noise"" and the ""cleaning ability.""After having used it for the last two weeks I agree that the vacuum cleans very well, and on many different surfaces from tile to shag. But I do not find the vacuum quiet at all. I have also noticed that the handle is heavier than expected, I have not experimented with removing the tools in the handle to see if that makes a difference. Over all I would buy this vacuum again."
2,HOOVER Savvy 7300 sucks but not for long,Good looking machine with plenty of suction power but the belt broke in two weeks. Returned and went with Kenmore Intuition for a lot more money. But it rocks!
5,WOW!!! I am extremely happy with this product!,"I would definitely recommend this vacuum to anyone. It is quieter than my last which was a bissel, and it has great suction. The hose for stairs or corners is very flexible compared to my old vacuum which was stiff. I am really excited about it. I vacuum like 3 times a day now because I like using it so much, lol!!! It has 3 different attachments, including a turbo brush, which is awesome. I would say the only bad thing about it is that it is heavy. I do have a hard time carrying it up the steps. Overall, I am very happy with the product and love my new vacuum. I can now vacuum a lot faster and it even propels itself forward so you do not have to hurt your back pushing it forward."
2,HEAVYWEIGHT HOMEMAKER MODEL,"Anxiously awaited the arrival of this saw. Expected top quality from my experience with other Bosch tools I own. Somebody forgot to tell the designers that a heavy duty saw needs to have a heavy duty handle! The handle on this thing feels like a piece of flexible plastic that belongs on a toy rather than on a power tool! Unfortunately, Bosch says I need to return it if I'm unhappy with it, to Tool Crib. If I do this I need to pay a restocking fee plus the shipping from Hawaii. Live and learn I guess, never buy sight unseen!"
5,Eliminating Victimization,"One of the main problems with most organizations is the amount of victimization throughout; blaming everything and everybody for ones problems. In delightful story form, this book shows how one can go from being a victim to self leader. The book gets at the very foundational factors that allow us to learn and grow and shows how we can use our power to lead ourselves and others. It is a must-read for everyone."
5,"Simple, but effective","This book is a great tool for new and old manager's alike. It helps you identify areas for improvement to get the most out of your team and yourself. Simple, but effective."
5,"""I Need"" for you to buy this book!","This is an excellent book. Finally, someone added 'meat' to the usual just-smile-and-everyting-will-be-ok type leadership books flooding the market. This book has practical tools, charts and secrets that can be applied to any industry, goal or task. It is a quick read and you will not be disappointed. Look at the other reviews. People love this book. I bought copies for everyone in my family!"
5,Self Leadersip,"This is another volume in the Outstanding One Minute Manager series. You will note that while Blanchard's name is listed he is not the only author. This is typical of all his books. Still, it dovetails nicely with other books in the series. Well worth reading for student and professional alike."
3,DISTURBING AND ENGROSSING!,"Harry Selby knows disturbingly little about his father's past, until he comes to Summitt City, a efficiently operated city, where he and his half-brother begin to unlock the secrets of their family. But he suddenly disappears!"
4,Nice book,This was purchased as a gift and the recipient was delighted with it. It had a lot of good information that should help her with her job search.
2,Not earth shaking information,"I did not finish reading this book, and I will read almost anything. If you have any grasp on ettiquette, you do not need to purchase this book. It is boring and common-sense. Maybe I quit reading before the good parts!"
1,Really poor product,"Frustrating to teach it codes, get a power failure and you have to re-teach it. Pilot lights are so dim you can't see them in daylight. Branded RCA but not really, built by someone else. This is a waste of time and money. We need a really good switch but this isn't it."
1,Bad Documentation,"Good luck trying to get the device to recognize your hand-heldremote controls. The documentation is badly written and evencontradictory is some spots. On page 8, Step 5, it says ""Repeat step 3 & 4 for additional devices"". On the very same page, after Step 6, it says ""Repeat steps 2,3 & 4 for additional devices"". OK, folks, which one is it? I taught a ReplayTV remote to learn how to control 3 devices, set up all the cabling, and had no trouble running a complex TV, 2-VCR, ReplayTV set up until I got to this product. It's been over one day now, and I still have to select devices manually.... There is nothing on the RCA website of any technical help. Also, you will not find any description in the documentation of how this product is supposed to work with your remotes after it ""learns"" the codes. How do you know it's working then? Don't waste $80 on this kludge. Go get a cheap manual switch. It will work with a lot less aggravation."
3,"In a world of Multi-Media, Where is the Multi Out?","To begin with, I have not purchased this product but have had a lot of experience with this type of item over the last several years. I was glad to see a home router system that includes inputs for Standard Video or S-VHS (although most people who are concerned with these options, probably have this capability through their A/V receiver)but I was very disappointed to see that the only output was to the television set. Have we forgotten the attachment of videotape machines or the forthcoming recordable DVD machines. I am looking for a quality system (which RCA usually is) with the versatility of not being outdated within twelve months."
3,Ok if you have 3 hours,"This unit is ok, but the main problem with it is that the programing features is none but JUNK! Unless you take your universal remote and go through each code until it works, For me the only remote codes that worked was RCA and ONKYO. It is really too bad they didn't have a seperate remote. Overall if you own all RCA products in you home theater get this!!! But if you are like me and own mosty Sony you might wanna pass unless you want to get up every time to switch it."
1,RCA VH920 doesn't work remotely!,"The RCA VH920 is great for hooking up numerous s-video devices, but forget the claims that it will learn your remote. I have tried two different VH920's with no luck. Sometimes it will learn a code, but selects the wrong device. It won't work with my pronto, tivo, or DSS remote. Sometimes it would recognize my DVD remote, but if I tried to teach it another code, it would select the wrong input. Sometimes it would lock up.RCA doesn't list any phone numbers to call for help. RCA customer support needs to address this issue on their website pronto! Don't waste your money unless you can talk to RCA about these issues.George"
2,"Read the small type: ""either"" composite or s-vhs","This is an OK unit, and if you want the nifty remote control learning feature (it switches source whenever it detects you using a remote for a differnt source) BUT it forces you to have all s-vhs or all composite/rca connection NOT a mixture as is the case for nearly all of us. For example, your DVD player will have s-vhs but your vcr is 99% likely to only have composite/rca. This box does not convert composite/rca to s-vhs. (...)If you get stuck - dont scarafice your digital sources quality (...)."
4,The Best Choice,"I have owned one of these for two years. Overall I am very happy with it.For the price there is no better way to have remote switching.The biggest caveat is the remote learning feature-its very temperamental,and you must reprogram for even a momentary power outagesuch as an accidental power strip switching.Also the switcher claims universal remote learning,but was not able to learn codes for any of my devices.Switching with a remote power button signal doesn't make senseif you leave your system on.My recommendation isto program a extra component on your universal remote to an RCA TV.If you need this switcher you should have an 8 device universal remote anyway.Once you have RCA TV codes in your universal remoteit is very easy to program this switcher...problem solved."
1,Buyer beware!,"Bought this in November 1999, even after reading the other reviews... Suffice to say, it is all true. While the promised functionality is great, after a ""successful"" programming of the unit, it correctly switches about one out of every four or five times to the device you select. Maybe one out every two I could have lived with. Three hours of my life were wasted..."
2,I am returning it.,"I have the usual problem, need a switch with more than 4 inputs, and want to stay couch bound while switching. Not wanting to shell out the >300 for JVC, I gave this one a try.I found the remote learning erattic at best. Never got it working robustly. (at best, could get it to switch between two inputs, and random other remote buttons could cause it to trip). I even tried the ""Zenith"" hack mentioned in another review.While the remote was dissapointing, it did have six inputs, and a good indication of which one was selected. Better than the passive 4 input box anyhow?? NO. The audio section was horrid. It clipped badly when fed standard level signals. (output from the Tivo for example) You might not notice on a typical TV speaker/amp set, but feeding it into my main audio system was painful.Well I guess I get to see how well amazon return processing works. Anyone have a JVC 8288s85 they don't want? (don't need component video yet...)"
1,Awful,These songs are sung by an orchestra not by the original artists. This was not told when I ordered this CD.
5,MJ ROCKS!,I had this video for such a long time and had to watch it again for old times sake. MJ is really a great person! I don't understand y they always have to be beasting on him and stuff. MJ is a legend and we should all still love him no matter how he looks. He will always be the greatest singer of all time!
4,The Gamut of Rollins,"Broken Summers chronicles the making of the Rise Above album to benefit the West Memphis Three (http://www.wm3.org) and in so illustrates the range of Rollins. From the giddy emotions to working with some of his old Flag bandmates and other greats (Lemmy from Motorhead) to the depression that inevitable hits him after a tour, this book runs the gamut. You can read how much he absorbs the knowledge in books, in music; it really makes you want to kick off the dust in your own life. The passages regarding touring to support this album bring the energy of those show to life. For those who saw it, we will never forget it and it is remarkable reading about the show he played in your city in his own words. The ""Albatross!"" chapter is a must for any Black Flag fan. You will never laugh this loud. The mystery of Dale Nixon will haunt our laughter for years. A definate read for any Rollins, Black Flag, or music fan out there."
4,"Fans of Henry # 1, Look Here!","The title of this review refers to a review I wrote of Rollins' ""Unwelcomed Songs"". This book, ""Broken Summers"", showcases Henry #1: funny, articulate and insightful. The man truly gives readers a window not only into his life, but into his mind. Books like this are why journaling is often called an art form.The only thing that doesn't work here? The added-on Thomas Wolfe tribute chapter, ""Nights Below the Treeline"". It comes at the end of the book; it's all right for what it is---evidence of Rollins' continued growth as a writer---but it doesn't really fit with the rest of manuscript. But that's a minor concern.This is a fine work by a talented author. If this is the first Henry Rollins book you've ever read, you're in for quite a treat."
1,Lithium batteries were not fresh and had reduced capacity,These lithium batteries from Mybatterysupply were not fresh and had reduced capacity. I used them in a laser sight that was starting to dim noticeably after a few seconds from having used it extensively and run down the original battery. I ordered a six pack of new ones and they dimmed right away also. When I checked the voltage on them they were the same as the one I had already used extensively. There was no expiration date on them and I assume they must have been close to or past expiration. In the future I'll only buy replacements with an advertised expiration date that shows they are fresh.
2,RUBISH FROM THE START!,"My brother and I got 2 packs of these for Christmas this year and us, along with our dad were super excited to try them out. We took it to my schools field (with grass that is not super hard) and within 10 minutes the first one broke. Then it all went down hill from there. By the end of our trip, about 45 minutes, all 4 had broke in some way, quite poorly constructed. Even if they hadn't fallen apart, they had plenty major issues like for instance, 3 out of 4 didn't spin which is really bad because the spinning makes the parachute fly out and not crash land, and that is the whole point of the rocket! Over all DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, it is worthless."
2,super bad,The parachute did not deploy 1 time. The only reason I rated it a 2 star is because it still flies.You should NOT buy these.
1,Trash! Pure trash!!!,"Would have given this NO STARS if given the option. As the other reviewers have stated, do not spend a penny for this product. It will not, and cannot, work as designed! PERIOD! The person that gave 5 stars will have figured this out on their first attempt. I feel bad for kids these days as the manufacturers are putting out more and more trash. The packaging and the toy look like hours of enjoyment when all you really get is major disappointment. Amazon should set up a system whereby if a toy gets a certain number of poor reviews the product is pulled from their site.Watch this youtube video and you'll see that it works in only 1 of 3 attemps, and not very well at that.[...]"
3,"a personal biography, not that accessible","This may be interesting to those with knowledge of modern Congolese politics. It is the story of a mixed-race family growing up in Congo, Tanzania and the U.S. It was not that accessible and it was hard to finish as it was a bit dry, the effort of a new writer who unfortunately died before he could further hone his craft. It felt like he was trying to say too much about race, politics and African history in one personal novel."
5,You should READ this one . THUMBS UP!,I just finished reading it just few hours ago it really cool and I really recomend it should be read by both people of africa and the and the world as well. Good stuff.
2,Could have been better.,"While it was overall a good read I feel the author could have done more with the book than he did. I felt as if I was left hanging. Mr. Wamba, for the most part, only focused on his and other Africans' negative experiences with African-Americans while barely touching on their positive encounters (which I'm sure there are many) outside of the impression African-American pop-culture has made on African youths. Mr. Wamba fails to fully explain the reasons for the hostility African-Americans and African people have for each other. He only mentions it and gives no intelligent explanation or solution. The author gave us little hope that the gap between African and African-American people will ever be bridged. But it's a great book if you want to learn more about African culture."
2,My first bike,"The bike came with instructions not clearly written and the front wheel is too big, each time I try riding the bike my feet gets tangled with the front tire. The bike is designed for someone much shorter but I kept the bike because it is able to provide me with the exercise i need. I would recommend the bike for a teenager not for an adult like myself who needs a bike for that price to be comfortable. The price is a little too high, I think for the price I expect the bike to be fully assembled in the box and all I needed to do is open the box and spray some bike chain lubricant on the back gear mechanism and start riding I had to buy a special wrench that fit in order to complete the assembly.Kawasaki DX226FS 26-Inch Dual Suspension Mountain Bike"
2,"Good looking, but.....","It is a great looking bike, but it took me two weeks to finally ride on it. I had to replace the front wheel. And when I did ride on it, i found it very difficult, when uphill, the bike tried to adjust the gear itself (you can hear the ""KaTA Ka TA' noise), but this makes it impossible ride. So all I could do was to climb down and walked it till i could ride again. Beside, the customer service of the online shop I bought this from is horrible! I called them about 5 times, each time get a totally contradictory answer to the other answers."
1,Bike is crap,I brought this bike and in two weeks the peddles and crank broke!I will never buy another Kawasaki!
2,Front Wheel Defective,"Overall the bike was easy to install, except for the front wheel. The screw on the left side of the wheel does not have a hole in it, so I wasn't able to stick the metal thing through to keep my front wheel in place. Although there's a hole on the screw on the right side of the wheel, I could stick the metal thing through that but it wouldn't matter cuz the other screw doesn't have a hole, so the metal thing cant go through it."
2,hmmm not so cool design,"These pliers aren't to well, I thought they were something totally different. They are built good but the design is horrible. They are to small to use on most cars and trucks. Work ok on some 4 cylinders, but really don't need to use pliers on the 4 cylinders these work on. Waste of box space and money, might do decent on lawn mowers or something but they suck for an automotive shop."
4,"It's not really a fault of the manufacturer, but...","This style of drain is just ineffective. There is too much surface tension across the grid strainer to drain effectively and without an overflow for a pressure relief, the backpressure from the trap makes it awful. They looked great and were machined smoothly, though. The quality is fantastic, overall, it's just not a great design. I suppose if you're pouring something with a very low surface tension down the drain all day it might be fine, but water doesn't flow through it very well."
2,crazy8,I read Michel Houellebecq's novel The Map and the Territory which I found hypnotic.However I didn't enjoy Whatever because it was too bleak whereas The Map and the Territory was as an artistic cocktail of Lou Reed and Kafka.It was so clever that I think it spoilt me with respect to his other works.
4,Houellebecq at his most entertaining,"I disagree with the general consensus that ""Whatever"" is inferior to his later works ""Platform"" and ""Atomised"". ""Whatever"" is short, punchy and fresh- with an acidic yet strangely sensitive humour. It is free of the emotional bombast of ""Atomised"" (is anybody really that unlucky) and the crude anti- Islamic rhetoric of ""Platform"" (although his fortelling of Islamist violence in Thailand borders on the prophetic). Houellebecq has yet to return to the form he showed in ""Whatever""."
2,Not his best,"He writes well about people feeling isolated and misunderstoodin the world. I will give him that. But this book hardly livesup to The Elementary Particles. In that book,there is a subversion of the genre called ""I'm writing aboutnot so nice people who are both alienated and alientating tosociety,"" in that the story is actually reasonably wellformed. Here, it's just not done as well."
4,bad translation,some of the English in here reads like the publisher fed the French version into an online translator like Babelfish...this really ruined an otherwise brilliant book for me...
2,Stranger Rip-Off,"Read this after you read Houellebecq's other novels, if you like them. This was his first embryonic/''homage''-stage. He revisits elements of Sartre in other books more in passing."
3,Disgusted,"The main character in this book gives us a cynical diatribe against sexual and economical liberalism, wherein men and women are painted as disgusting, decrepit adolescents. They are only searching for more sex, power and influence in the marketplace or taking the necessary measures to assure their dominating position therein. The main targets of his insults are psychiatrists, dentists, bureaucrats and women, although at the end he seeks himself psychological counselling!This book reads like a train. The French title 'Extension du domaine de lutte' suggests that the author intended to portrait a rebel in our modern capitalist society. But his main character becomes disillusioned and leaves the rat race for a peaceful retreat in the countryside!This book gives us a good portrait of the actual working conditions of middle management in a big modern company.A worth-while read."
2,a big disappointment,"I must say that I read this book in the Italian translation, _Estensione del dominio della lotta_ (that is to say, a literal version of the original title). So, maybe I missed something (in my opinion, the language is very important).In any case, how can critics and readers say that Houellebecq is a great writer? He seems to me only to be a pale, pathetic imitator of Louis-Ferdinand Céline. With a notable difference: Céline was a true cynic, a man with no morality at all, and his absolute perfidy succeeeds in reaching sublimity.On the opposite side, Houellebecq seems to me only an awkward schoolboy, trying to represent sexual degradation and repulsiveness just like a preacher could do.Psychiatric help requested (unless Houellebecq's girl-friend, Michelle Lévy, can do something better)...."
2,"It's ok, but not my favorite",* I still like the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny or the Garnier Fructis Serum or the Organix Keratin Serum Better* Try something else and I think you will be happier you did
2,it's ok,I bought this at Target & returned it. Glad I didn't pay shipping! It's ok. I have fine hair.. I used it to tame it a little bit and when I got home a few hours later my hair looked like I hadn't washed it in two days! It looked pretty nasty. It didn't look shiny it just looked oily and slick. Maybe it's for girls with curly hair..
2,different,"I've used this product for years, but this particular item has an odd smell and doesnt seem to work as well as the ones I purchase in stores. .Maybe its an expired product? I'm not sure"
4,I love this stuff!,I love this! I used it as a straightening spray instead of just a shine spray and it works wonders. It makes my hair soo soft:)
5,So much shine,"This is a great product. The first bottle came with the straw stuck in the lid and it was melted from the heat during shipment. Needless to say, it leaked all over my order and the straw was melted into two! They quickly (not so easy though) replaced the order for me. The product is great, just be careful on the packaging of the product, dude in the warehouse! LOL"
3,Not Impressed,"The best part about this purchase was that it arrived quickly and that it was reasonably priced.The spray itself didn't impress me. Although it smells nice, it doesn't add as much shine as I was hoping for."
5,"Good, better and best","These guys are the real deal. Very good. Two thumbs up . . . way, way up. If you like a sweet fiddle, fiery mandolin, skillful guitar and a rocking banjo combined with clear, honest voices singing some inspired lyrics, buy this CD. What makes these guys special is that all the while they are paying much deserved tribute to the history and legends of bluegrass and old time music, they are forging ahead with a sound that is all their own."
3,not as good as i had hoped,"Saw these guys together with Jim Lauderdale on the Woodsongs Radio Hour, and they were *fantastic*, really hot. Mr. Taylor's New Home was one of the songs they played on Woodsongs, leading me to get this disc. I guess it's alright, but it pales in comparison to their live performance. If I'd heard this first I might have liked it better."
2,"Good music, but vocal not so much","This album clearly demonstrates what great musicians the Rangers are, but the vocals from Lizzie are pitiful. Her voice is so insipid, it ruins the CD for me. Even though I fast forward through her songs, it's a shame that the band wasted two tracks on her. Glad to see she is no longer with the band. Later CD's are fantastic!"
3,Unless there's something better out there...,"mmm... If I didn't have to have this book as a course text, I would have soon discarded it. Maybe I'm missing the point of what PRINCIPLES of Information Systems are all about, but I get the distinct impression from this particular book that Principles of Information Systems is simply an exercise in 'reading someone's watch, then telling them the time'. The authors formalize with great diagrams, case histories and explanations, how Information Systems are structured in business today. However they only lightly touch on what principles (good logic if you wish), should be employed in designing a 'quality' Information System. The closest they really get to this is sometimes posing the issue in the question sections (answers not provided!). I know Information Systems is a lot more than simply knowing how existing ones structured but if you want to know more beyond this, don't expect to find answers in this book."
3,An easy introduction to information systems,"Prescribed to all new BCom students locally as part of an introductory informatics course, it serves it purpose colourfully and with lots of applications in real world situations. Not completely up to date on the newest issues, but worth a buy."
3,A cure for insomnia!,"This book is seriously a cure for insomnia. Now note that I am an information systems major at James Madison University, and I do find the material interesting, but the way this book is written, it will put you to sleep. Better have other textbooks handy if you are planning to read this in order to switch to them to wake up before continuing. It is VERY dry reading. Otherwise, it's a good text, and does convey the point."
2,"Used in a classroom lab setting, they fall apart easily","Our classroom lab uses these headsets and I must say that they break easily. Within three weeks we had students returning these headsets left and right with broken microphones. The part covering the ears would snap easily and break in such a way that there is no way to repair this headset.While I understand teenagers break things easily, and that half of the headsets that were shorted out were of the student's fault (playing music through them at high volumes), it does not excuse the fragility of this product."
3,not perfect,It is good in sound qulity and microphone qulity. But it has small adjustable size. So it can not fit my head comfortable. Nor did it for my officemate.
2,cheap,These didnt last to long after i got them. Foam on earpiece didnt last a day. Right side of headphone stopped working after a weekWould not buy again
2,Product does not hold up well over time,"I've had the Labtec C-322 Stereo Headset/Boom Microphone for a couple of years now, and have had the same experience as with other Labtec equipment. They just don't hold up to normal wear and tear.On this particular piece of equipment, the left speaker has begun to rattle and pop. It's blown.The slide mechanism that maintains the size of the headphones on your head broke withing a month or two. Flimsy plastic tabs just don't make for durable equipment.If you want a throw-away model of headphone, buy these ... ; otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,Tin can,I use it to talk over the internet. Everyone thinks I'm on a speaker phone. There's no kill switch so you get feedback if you try to use speakers.
4,Doesn't know her right from her left.,"I wasn't trying to be snide. In the video she will say ""Start on the right."", or ""Bend the right knee."", and will indicate the right by pointing or tapping...but it's always her left! It's disconcerting. Despite that, the workouts are pretty good for beginners."
5,A Beginner's Must Have!,Does a great job at taking you through the steps at the right pace and intensity. A must have for beginners!
4,Great beginner workout,I bought this DVD after reading all of the great reviews from Amazon customers. Amy has great energy and gives you proper instruction on working with kettlebells during exercises. I definitely recommend this DVD for first time kettlebell users like myself.
4,kettlebell is fun,this was my first time trying kettlebell and i must say i like it and amy bento is a great instructor however her intermeditate workout was a little disappointing i figured i would break a sweat but still i use it as an aid great video for first timers
5,The way to start Kettlebells,"This video is absolutely the way to start in Kettlebells! She has a training section, a beginners and intermediate section. Her form and moves are right on. I started with five pounds and the first time could only get through one circuit. I am doing better now. It is my third day with this. She also has some stretching after the beginning workout. The intermediate section also includes some cardio. And, of course, I hadn't worked out in a couple of years but feel that this will keep me going. It is fun and short when you are finished you know you have had a workout. I am 69 years old...."
4,all the basics,"this instant video has all the basic moves and a decent workout. would like more instant workout videos. Work on it, Amazon!"
3,Basic workout,"I'm new to kettleball and thought this might be a good start; however, it's a little boring. Need to keep looking for a little more of a challenge."
5,"Gut Wrenching, Could not put it down","As soon as a child comes out to their parents this book should become required reading for the parents. It shows the struggles of a boy between his religion, family and his own sexuality. Somehow the family considered themselves the same as their religion and forgot their role as parent and unconditional love. The son paid for it from his agony and eventual suicide. This book will rip at you, it is an emotional read. It is a necessary read."
5,"""Prayers for Bobby"" is a Blessing!","Author Leroy Aarons chroniles Betty Griffith's journey after the suicide death of her gay son, Bobby. While some readers may claim that this book is ""too sad and depressing"" I actually found it filled with hope, as I saw Mary's 180 degree turn and transformation from Prebysterian religious fundalmentalist to a woman who questions the church's position on homosexuality. Simply put it is not God who finds fault with homosexuality. It is more those that interpret the Bible and their interpretations on it. This is one book that I wish more people would read, because I think their is something here for everyone, given the current political nature of this country. Readers of this book may never know all the reason why Bobby Griffith took his life, but we can hope that out of his death many lives can be saved."
5,A book EVERYBODY should read!,"I bought this book because, being a gay teenager and having thought about suicide (and tried to do it, actually), I wanted to read about another boy who had gone through what I was going through. I found it remarkable when I read the reaction of Mary Griffith. When I started reading it I thought to myself: ""Oh my God, that's me! This is my story."" I couldn't put it down at all and I had never in my life cried while reading a book. This was my first time. I really think that everybody should read this book. It's actually more than a story; it's life. I really wish this book would be adopted by high schools for reading. It was incredible."
5,PRAYERS FOR BOBBY... A MUST READ,"AN EXTRAORDINARY ORDINARY STORY. WELL WRITTEN ON A VERY TODAY HOT TOPIC [HUMAN RIGHTS FOR LGBT]. EVERY PARENT, TEACHER, HEALTH , OR SOCIALLY ORIENTED PROFESSIONAL, SHOULD READ THE BOOK [THERE'S ALSO A MOVIE] AND TAKE NOTES. YOUNG LIVES CAN AND SHOULD BE SAVED."
3,a good resource,"This anthology of numerous race-related essays is pretty good. As a Chinese American, I found many stories and situations to which I could relate. Voices of Color is a good place to find inspiration for writing one's own personal essay regarding racial issues. I think it would also be an engaging read for anyone who is at all interested in the growing ethnic diversity of America's population. I have to admit, however, that the stories can get somewhat monotonous. It seems that most of the authors whose essays are in Voices of Color experience similar oppression and have similar opinions on everything. Voices of Color is just one of many places one can find race-related narratives. I wouldn't recommend purchasing more than one of these types."

1,piece of junk,"It worked well....While it worked. I used it twice, and it just quit. It wouldnt be too bad if I hadnt already moved the distributor and now need to drive an untimed pickup (but I really wouldnt know, would I?) to buy a replacement. Borrow, rent or buy the next level up. The worst tool is the one you have to buy twice."
5,Perfect for setting timing on my vehicles,"I had an old one that my father gave me, but it quit working years ago... time to buy a new one!I gave this one a shot, and am very pleased with the function and simplicity... it works exactly as the one that was decades old.Simple to hook up and use, appears to be very solid in construction, and does what it is supposed to do!Once out of the package, I had the timing set in my old truck and my Beetle in no time at all!I highly recommend this timing light for anyone that turns their own wrenches on classic vehicles!"
3,"It is simple, but does the job",It does the job for a good price. Would be nice if the plastic used for its manufacturing were of much better quality.
3,Decent gadget,"I purchased this device to help me set the timing on a vintage motorcycle. It seems to do its job. I have used it just a couple of times but expect that I will need it every few months to check the timing on the old bike. The strobe is just bright enough to use in the shade or in the garage with the lights out. I feel like it will be fine so long as I don't drop it, because the plastic housing seems a bit fragile."
1,Used it Twice & it STOPPED working...,"They say you get what you pay for.....I bought this inexpensive timing light because of the great reviews I read about the product. I guess I had a little different experience than you guys. I used it twice to set the timing on my old F100 pickup. I was having some distributor issues. When I went to check it a third time....no light! I checked the ground, the plug wire connection, etc and still nothing. Now I have to deal with the crap of trying to return it....argh!"
3,so so,"works ok, but light not as bright as would be expected. wanted to get the equss model but it was back orderd and didnt know when it would be in stock. of course right after i get this one amazon has the equss. neighbor has the equss model and it is more bright and a flexible head. bad thing this actron made of sealed plastic, so if it stops working, no way to open up and repair.debateing on returning or exchangeing it for the equss"
1,poison,"bought from amazon.I hope amazon will stop letting this be sold on their site.what don't I like.I dont like that this timeing lite has wires that are poisonyes poison.I noticed a small tag on the electric cord,many people would miss reading this little tag.It says that the electric cord contains lead,goes on to say,a chemical known to the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm wash hands after using.end of tag quote.Now its nothing for the communistchinese to send poison products over here.I resent that a american company knowing that this product contains lead still sells it.a tiny tag does absolve them.I also dislike the way the product was packed.It takes a very sharp knife and great care to get the product out of the plastic.a lot of products are packed this way.I expect a lot of people cut themselves trying to open it."
5,great simple timing light,"nothing sophisticated. just connect, follow procedure outlined by the manufacturer of your vehicle, and point and shoot. make your adjustment and your done. its' a tool not used very often anymore with electronic ignition. so unless you work on vintage cars and trucks you won't be using it very often. so don't buy an expensive model. keep it simple."
4,Actron CP7527 Inductive Timing Light,"Received the light faster than expected, thank you Amazon! Once I was able to remove the unit from it's plastic, steel wrapper, I couldn't believe how tough that plastic was, the light performed great! No setup problems, connected in a snap and gave a very bright and easy to use light."
4,Kitchen Aid Left Me Hanging for KCMCF Filters,"When I bought the Coffee Marker that uses this filter I should have known something was up! The Sales Clerk told me when I purchased the machine that ""I should stock up on filters, as we have them on sale at a really good price"" I did, not knowing that I would not be able to find the replacement filters, #KCMCF ever again. I called Kitchen Aid to source for these filters and their only response was that ""the filters are optional and don't effect the performance of the Coffee Maker"" That's crap! The whole reason for the filter is to inhance the quality of the coffee by filtering out impurities in the tap water! I am completely dissatisfied with Kitchen Aids attitude regarding this product and won't be purchasing any other products that they sale or market under their name. Thanks Kitchen Aid for standing behind your products!"
3,They don't support it because it was recalled!,"They don't support it because it was recalled!Really was the best coffee maker I found, until it was recalled for bursting into flames.brew time was a bit long at 9:20, but temp rises fast and is stable at 200 degree water with 180 holdJust one little problemSee above"
3,"An easy start with useful tools, but not flamenco puro","For the musician who wants to dabble in flamenco-ish guitar, Sedlak's DVD is fine and does a good job getting you spun up on some basic techniques quickly. In fact if nothing else this DVD helps de-mystify a few basic techniques (especially rasgueado) quickly for the uninitiated. And if you are into rumba flamenca (which is great stuff but not truly flamenco), this DVD will help get you there.BUT if you are serious about true Andalucian flamenco puro (the real deal) and putting in your best efforts to get there -- this DVD is not for you, although again it is useful in helping understand certain right-hand techniques."
5,FLAMENCO MADE EASY,"The Flamenco Made Easy DVD is really oustanding and the Charles Sedlak insrtuctions are trully easy to follow. I am however haveing a problem finding the correct website in order to download the ""Bonus Lessons"" that are offered. Please send me the correct website so that I can get these lessons. Thanks.......Miguel H.[[ASIN:B000B78YGY Guitar Lessons: Flamenco Made Easy Learn How to play Flamenco guitar instructional video."
2,Flamenco made easy,"I am not very fond of this DVD. You can learn some technical aspects of Rasgueos, but all the flamenco pieces of the DVD do not really sound like the soul of flamenco. So I cannot recommend this DVD.Especially if you compare this DVD with the really good ones of Juan Martin or Juan Serrano."
2,okay gloves,"I liked the idea of Kevlar in the glove. They fit well, breath well, but the stitching started to come undone after a couple of weeks. After about a month the fingertip stitching started to come undone and the kevlar finger tips would snag on things. I'll stick to mechanix gloves. Even the cheap versions hold up better and are machine washable!"
4,Rip-roaring ride!!,"Seattle's finest (Mudhoney, Scott McCaughey, etc..) tear through Sonics classics with just as much reckless abandon as Roslie and Co did during the early '60's.It sounds as though the boys and a ton of fun as they raged through this set. No huge departues from the originals, but who cares. Just turn it it up as loud as local ordinances will allow and enjoy."
4,This is a useful item.,"I bought something like this and it's safed my skin a few times. You get the pouch and the belt, my only concern is do you get the guppies(pods)? If you know plz reply thank you. I rated this a 4 but if you do get the pods also then it gets a 5."
1,My luck was bad...care to try yours?,"Received player. Pleasantly surprised, felt substantial and controls seemed sturdy. Downloaded music file folders (Country, R&B, Classic Rock, etc.,) all with subfolders by artist. Noticed 1st problem, could not shuffle within main genre folder. Had to be on a song to go into shuffle mode but as the files within my folder had subfolders by artist, all it would do was shuffle within an album by that artist or between all songs by that artist. When I went to ""Shuffle all"", would shuffle all songs, playing a country followed by rap, etc which I did not like. After trying to call customer service (line repeatedly busy), I went to bed. When I awoke, I turned on MP3 so the unit would be powered when I called Coby's support line and noticed that I now had a ""HDD read error"". After an hour got through to Coby: they were rude and unhelpful. Sent back to Amazon."
4,Great value!,"First of all, mine must be an upgraded version from this. Amazon, cnet, zdnet all have this same outdated photo. The new one can be seen on the cobyusa.com site. Also, the shuffle modes shuffle by song, directory or to include or not include subdirectories now. As for other reviewers having problems with it shuffling country with rap, that can easily be solved by a little file maintenance and organization: First, delete most of the country, and then all of the rap - that way, almost everything you have left that might come up on shuffle will sound musical! (Sorry, couldn't resist...) Anyway, it's a great value and easy to transfer MP3's and WMA's via USB. You can also set it up to charge via USB, and skip the wall wart. No Apple proprietary garbage or silly software to install, either."
3,Adequate,"Not the best player out there, but it works. I can use it with Windows Vista and my XP laptop. Controls could be easier to use and give more options (like making playlists). All in all, it was worth the $100 bucks I paid for it. I just wish those jerks at Creative would have continued to support the Zen Nomad Jukebox, instead of saying it ""has reached the end of service life""."
1,The Biggest waste of Money,"This is the worst item I have ever purchased. If you feel like throwing away $175 save yourself the shipping cost and just open your trash can. The item was great for about 12 hours of total listening prior to the music stopping in the middle of a song and never turning back on. Yes, it was fully charged at the time. My best advice, spend the extra money and buy something better. This is a very expensive piece of garbage. DO NOT BUY!!!"
5,So far - so good,"Bought these for my son who plays in his high school jazz band. He likes them, which is the most important part. Secondly, they haven't broke yet (had them for 3 or 4 months, they practice a few hours a week) - so that's always good."
1,NOT the original recordings,"These are newer recordings made by Dean during the 1980s, without Jan's involvement. Not the original recordings from the '60s."
1,not shipped,order has been canceled by you !!!I have nothing more to sayI have nothing more to sayI have npothing more to say
4,Keeps on ticking,What can you say about a watch battery? I guess only that I'm amazed how long these little things last. I have a bunch of devices that use them and my only gripe is that they don't sell them in large packs (i.e. 6 or 8).
5,Awesome Block,This chopping block is beautiful! Very heavy and I love the feet on the bottom. It stays put when you're chopping!
5,Unwinding,"Written in clear, compassionate manner, this book encourages us to fully engage in our own health and healing. In this fast-paced world in which we live, Unwinding the Belly offers us the opportunity to breathe deeply and slow down. The techniques and wisdom offered by the authors provides a beautiful foundation for self transformation and healing."
3,Mediocrity is the Word,"In search of holistic health and healing, I have read nummerous books on yoga, meditation, self-healing, etc. I found this book to be a bit too simplistic and not very informative. Additionally, it could use a better editor. Overall, not too bad for those new to the holistic approach to self-healing. The diagrams are easy to follow and it's an easy read."
5,unwindingthe belly,"Wow! What an excellent book! It is equally as useful for the beginner into natural health as well as the practitioner. I felt it truly defined ""self healing"" and taking charge of one's own body/mind. Entertaining, informative ,easy to read without being too simplistic or too overbearing. It's one I will recommend to clients and friends."
4,Good Start To Understanding Isaiah,"The only way a person can truly understand Isaiah is through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Donald Parry, however, does a good job of getting the reader pointed in the right direction to better understand the style of writing used by the Prophet Isaiah. I have noted at times his explanation of some passages differs from that of say Monte Nyman or John Bytheway. It just shows that none of them truly understand Isaiah and that we must go to the Holy Ghost for that real answer. In general he does a good job and I have a better understanding of the words of Isaiah than I would without his book. If you want to better understand Isaiah, it should be in your library."
4,"Helpful, but not Great",I have enjoyed re-reading Isaiah with the help of this book. It provides good insight and help in understanding some of the difficult passages of Isaiah's writing and combines the Book of Mormon quotes of Isaiah's writing and the changes from Joseph Smith's Translation of the Bible to aid in understanding.
1,Buyer Beware,"We ordered this product and was sent an e-mail from Sams Online advising the product was no longer available but that they could ship a substitute. They did not state what the substitute would be. We received Accu-Chek Compact 51 test strips. We were charged the price that was listed for the 102 test strips. Sams Online advise is ""return the item"" rather than them adjusting the price."
4,Beautiful!!,"The Atlas of Holy Places and Sacred Sites is a visually a beautiful book. The author has managed to make the pictures come alive, and you feel as though you walking through the sites yourself. It is a book that I will refer to over and over again."
2,"OK, Not Great","Interesting idea---how did John the Baptist take his captivity? What might it have been like for him and his disciples? Other than that, I didn't get a whole lot new out of it."
3,John the Baptist...,"I loved the story. It took me a few pages to figure out who it was about, but then it all was great. I just wish it had been longer"
2,A Disappointing Read,I just couldn't identify with the theology of this book. It was not at all what I had expected.
4,A Gem for the Hurting Heart,"Someone at church insisted that I read this book after suffering a terrible family loss. As a believer, I had no explanation why the Lord would allow what seemed to be the worst possible outcome - after years ofprayer. This book was so easy to read, but gave so much food for thought and soul. It really drew me back to the Word which began to restore my heart."
2,The Prisoner in the Third Cell,"Not easy to follow with my NIV Bible. John lived a harsh, but dedicated life waiting for the Messiah."
1,Please Make Edwards a Prisoner!,Dear Mr. Edwards:Please stop writing all together.There are plenty of careers as used car salesmen! You would be okay doing that!
2,Unbiblical,"I had to put down my kindle after I pushed through reading half the book. I just couldn't handle the writer's theology on most everything.The last straw was about Jesus's healing. Jesus healed all, not most. I won't get into proving it; this is a book review and not a debate.The broad summary of John's origin story sounds like ""Dos Equis: the most interesting man in the world"" commercial.The author just leaves the audience hanging with questions with a shrug of supposed Jesus's mysterious answers. John would know the scriptures Jesus quotes from.I'm sorry, but I won't seat through this bad sermon questioning God. Our Sovereign God is always right, therefore I trust Him. His love and mercy endures forever despite me, so I will praise Him because He first drew me with his graceful kindness. That is my theology.I don't know; the book wasn't ""inspirational."" I'll stay far away from this one."
5,The Best ever!!,"Amazing! Touched my heart deeply! I would recommend this book to everyone I know, what ever circumstance you find yourself in, this book will help you!!"
5,Excellent!,"I cannot recommend this book more to Christians. And I don't really have much else to say, other then get this book and read it! It will impact you!! God will use this in a mighty way in your life!!"
2,Read the Bible instead,"The author has tried to stretch out a scriptural story of John the Baptist in 94 short pages. The writing was very simple and almost seemed written more for Sunday School fare. I'm afraid I was expecting the writing to be on a deeper historical fiction level, with descriptions of places and character development, etc. centered around John....especially for a book over $6.00. The subject idea has good story potential which I thought the author would develop when I purchased the book. But, alas the story was just a prisoner in its own cover and much better read in the Bible."
3,Prisoner in the 3rd cell,"Not what I thought it would be, but it was good. Not sure about the ""additional"" information....that you don't find in the bible. Kind of an add-lib story but it did give me a good picuture in my mind of how it may have all been like. Painted a good story I guess."
3,not bad,"i got this cd after hearing a song by near miss of the warped tour sampler. i wasnt impressed with the sound quality of this album, however it may have been what they were looking for/could afford at the time. still like their music, just was expecting a little more from the cd itself."
2,Not a good read,"I really didn't learn anything from this book. Its focus was centered around Private Investigators use of pretext's. Pretexts are lies that are told to solicit information out of an interviewee. They can range from, ""You will be in trouble if you don't help me,"" to the opposite, ""You know, I did the same thing. It's alright to admit to the crime."" If that makes sense, then don't read this book and save yourself [the money]."
1,Same ole same ole,"Nothing new in this book.Here are some simple truths and advise that will more than cover the material within:1. Shut up and ask for a lawyer.2. An investigator is most likely lying to you in an attempt to scare you into saying anything.3. Once you say anything, you will tend to keep talking. So don't say anything about anything.4. Be extremely cautious about being coerced into giving consent to a search.5. If a warrant is not produced, tell (don't ask) an investigator to leave.6. When in doubt, see rule 1.That is more than is contained within this book. If you break any of the above rules, you will hinder your defense, And/or you will lead yourself down a path towards arrest. Innocent or not. There is no good reason for an investigator to come knocking. Period."
1,Big Letdown,"Here's the book in a nutshell:-If you are a PI, you should come up with a few lies and use them on people (ex: you already know information from someone else involved, you're an unbiased reporter writing a story, you're calling about a job interview, there was an eye witness that came forward, etc...)-If you are getting interviewed, the police have the right to lie to you so don't give them any information even if they say they already know or if they say you won't get in trouble.That's it. Every chapter is basically a variation of those two things. Total waste of time, save your money.I bought this book because I heard interesting things about Benson's books. If this is an indication of what his other books are like, then don't bother with any of them. Interviews, Investigations, and Interrogations, is a great idea for a book, but there's no substance. The whole thing you could have basically guessed at and not wasted your time or money. He doesn't give any real practical information."
2,If you love lawyers this is your book!,"The author proudly recounts investigation in which his mentality and vantage point gave me the creeps. Is there good info in the book, I don't know I stopped reading after chapter three. As a cop I would not endorse or recommend this book. Mine will be on ebay soon."
2,Flat screen died,"Was a nice tv when it was new, however two years after first use, the flat panel screen started showing some vertical lines going down the right side of he screen. Sony indicated it was out of warranty, and that a new screen would be $2500.00 plus install. We put some black tape over the lines, but new ones kept appearing, then when we decided to replace it, no screens were available. Not bad for a $ 4500.00 TV. Next time around an LCD tv from somewhere else."
1,Very disappointed,"This unit was purchased new and used infrequently. Very unhappy as it has now developed a 1.5-2 inch vertical black line running the width of the screen.I will begin the process of repairing the unit. But it is out of warranty, and if you look on the web, you will see that other owners have had this same problem-and it costs thousands for repair.I would strongly discourage others from purchasing a Sony TV."
4,Finally found them!,"After looking high and low for pointed toe navy pumps, I was so glad to find these!"
3,This is the same as HTA-1000,I bought the HTA-809 system ...recently and found that it gives decent performance for the price. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that a 100W subwoofer is included in the system....
5,I love this 3 piece!,I just thinks it's so adorabe &i like the material. My baby girl can't fit the socks on her tiny little feet though. I think it's very nice for what i paid for it!
5,One of the best English novels ever written,"Frankenstein the most recognizable title in fiction and yet the most neglected. Yes, the movies are fun but the novel is so important I'm surprised it isn't required reading for say, senior high school English. The issues it raises and explores include the paradoxical connections between life and birth and death. It examines relationships, the concept of ""parenting"", motherhood, sex and procreation. The world of nature and the man-made world, responsibility and knowledge, what makes us human. M.Shelly was only nineteen when she wrote it but she had suffered several miscarriges and the death of her baby by that time. The issues she writes about in Frankenstein must have been haunting her for some time. Almost two hundred years later this book has never been more relevant, and Frankenstein and his creation have become part of the popular consious. It's too bad the book's gotten pushed aside by movies, comics, etc."
4,"Not bad, but sometimes uncomfortable.","I am always looking for the latest in electronics. I enjoy chatting with many of my friends spread throughout the USA and it is much cheaper over the internet (albeit at lower quality). I gave it a try and think it really works well, however the collar can become somewhat uncomfortable after extened periods of use. Perhaps it is just because I am not used to it. Overall though, a solid product."
4,Very cool stuff.,"Higher on the strange factor than The Maxx, as well as being less profound about it's humanity, Aeon Flux is nonetheless fascinating, highly original, and down right kick ass. Any fan of adult animation would find this very stylized, sometimes unsettling vison of sex and violence in whatever bizarre, alternate reality it exists in, very cool, indeed."
3,A GOOD ATTEMPT,"HW&M, like any band jumping on the ""Swing Gravy Train"" has not put in the hours to master their skill. A promising band, but need to take what they do more seriously. However it is always good to see bands working and putting out new music for the public. Give them time, they're just a little green."
5,Chilling insights into insanity,"I love this album.It balances on the edge between insanity and genius.The melodies are sweet. The lyrics are dark. The contrast is excellent.Sample ""Freshman Thesis,"" or ""2 AM,"" or ""Walk of Shame,"" but for me this album must be listened to start to finish to truly experience the musician's state of mind."
4,Great resource,"I was quite surprised at how interesting and practical this book was. Many books on personal finance or job finding can be grueling to read and filled with more hype than useful tips. But Stacy Kravetz writes well, and she knows what she's talking about. She also has a pretty healthy perspective on jobs and finding jobs, which can provide hope for the underemployed college grad. If you're looking to organize your life in a sensible way, it's definitely worth skimming through once, but it can be a good reference guide as well."
4,Almost ideal ... but not quite.,"The hardcover, larger-print (not really large), NKJV MacArthur study bible is great on content and the type-size easier on the eyes, even if your vision is fine.Unfortunately, it's printed on thin ""see through"" tissue-paper. The print on the other side is a distraction that has to be filtered out. For a study bible, thinness needn't be a driving factor compromising legibility.The format could have been great, but slightly fell short of what the intended usage deserves."
3,A study Bible that deserves better printing,"I rate the quality of John MacArthur's commentary as a 5, whereas the PHYSICAL quality (printing/paper/binding) of this Bible is a weak 1. So I rate it overall in the mid-point *3*.John MacArthur is a superb teacher - conservative, evangelical, down-to-earth. If you can deal with the faded print, overly small font, glued binding, and see-through paper, the commentary itself is one of the very best."
5,An amazing product,"I keep a few in the car, and a few at work. Perfect for those really hot days when all you can do is sweat, but then you have to go to a big meeting. Really helps freshen you up."
5,hoo-ahhs field towels,these field towels are excellent for hunting and fishing or every day use.we use them duck hunting and turkey hunting on a regular basis.my wife keeps some in her car in case grandchildren have a accident.great product.
5,Just a friend - Too Phat,"I like this song ..coz' it's remind me to someone thatvery important in my life.And i'm a bigest fan's at Too Phat family..coz' i'm a M.C telenct & a b-boy player...So ,i hope u can play this review at to my RealOne Player list (at to My Libary in list).So..,i hope u can grand my wish..i really-really hope at tio u to play this title at to me"
5,THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT,"This album starts out with a triptych of mini-brainstorms and tapers of like a giant cetacean in an epic dive into the unconscious. I dare anyone to listen to the entirety of Hakuna Matata without moving, speaking, or thinking a stray thought. He or she who takes me up on the offer will know his or her own mind better at the end of the track. The Oneida know their own minds well enough not to steer us wrong."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I was a little disapointed with the book. I was looking more of a story of the action of the 101st in the Battle of the Budge, not a pictorial of the current 101st. The photos are good, but not what I had in mind."
2,disappointing,"This book has plenty of errors. Page 80 says import to library streaming.fla (file provided on their website). FlashMX chokes.I was hoping to pick up this book and write a crude web based non linear editor with FlashMX within a few hours, but this book is disjointed.By the way, page 58, MPEG is Moving Pictures Expert Group."
5,Excellent,Excellent Game! My 4-year old absolutely loves it and she caught on quick and spends a ton of time playing!
5,Fabulous,"These papaya bits are perfect treats for chinchilla's. I have a very picky chin, who refuses to eat most treats and specialty foods, but whom loves these. They aren't too high in sugar, and they aren't bad for chins, which make them a perfect treat. I highly recommend these treats!"
5,A masterfully written web of secrets and deception,"Wow...this is such a good book, its is hard to believe that this is the author's first novel. Beautifully written, with evocative imagery, this book really draws you into the setting. The dream sequence in the first chapter draws you in, but the web of secrets, lies and deceit keeps you reading. It seems that every character has a secret or is lying about something, and the author slowly unveils the truth at a pace that draws you further and further into the story. This is an excellent first novel, and hopefully it won't be this author's last."
4,Manatees are the best mammals,The Manatee and the Dugong are water mammals that spend there time eating marine grass and other water plants. They are similar in apearance but are quite different. Manatees are bigger and are found throughout the world. The Dugong is found in africa and is smaller and skinner. The two mammals are fun to learn about and have some cool things about them. They are both endangered and might go extinct in the next 5 to 10 yrs. In my opinion I think they are the best animals of the ocean.
2,Home remodeler,"I do home remodeling and cabinetry work. I was looking for a glove to protect my hands when doing major construction such as framing, etc. I was intrigued by the claims of dexterity and toughness. I was dissapointed. On one hand these gloves did protect my hands rather well. There toughness left something to be desired. The velcro closure on one glove came off by the third wearing. After 4 weeks on a 400 sq ft addition one of the fingers began to pop out. There name ""true-grip"" is slighty mis-leading. I nearly killed one of my workers when my Framing hammer (wooden handle) flew from my hands do to lack of friction. The Kevlar pads are tough but certainly not grippy. I must admit that the Kevlar pads have protected my hands and are very tough. Wish I could say the same about the rest of the glove (seams, thread, etc.) At the price you pay for these you would expect them to be a little more durable and long lasting. I don't think they were meant to be throw aways."
2,Heavy Duty Work Gloves made without the heavy duty in mind,I used these gloves over the course of a three day project erecting a cedar wood trelese over my back deck. I notice immediately that the stiching was coming undone and by the end of the third day the fabric on two of the five fingers on the left hand were showing signs of breaking through. I get more wear out of a pair of cheap work gloves you purchase at a hardware store.
2,"Nice features, poor durability","This glove has some well-thought out features, like the mesh backing, that make it very comfortable. It just doesn't hold up well, however, and isn't worth the price."
1,Reputation for Melting Power Supply and Roasting Drives,"The power supply burning out would have been bad enough, but the fact that it fried my 160GB IDE Barracuda is infuriating.When it worked, it worked on all 3 kinds of devices that it supports.However, today, I smelled smoke, and quickly unplugged everything. The case of the power supply was literally melting, and I nearly burned myself picking it up. I am certain it would have caught fire if I left it on for 30 more seconds. What's worse is the fact that this thing seems notorious for its power supply melting and frying HDDs (sometimes catching fire).This goes to show you that you should read reviews even for cheapie purchases.Take a look at the reviews for this on newegg. Some people have luck with this product, but 15% have horror stories, and *many* have the same problem I did.Don't take the gamble.However, consider this as a special gift for your enemies this holiday season."
2,Poor power supply,"Initially I was quite impressed with the device. However, after one use the power supply started heating up and smelling. I have been unable to get it to light up since.Bytecc BT-300 - Storage controller - IDE / SATA-150 - 150 MBps - Hi-Speed USB"
4,I use it for work,"I work in computer repair and I use this adapter to recover data from drives that wont boot. It works well and since there are three different adapter heads it works on any standard hard drive. Sata, IDE and I forget the other one. cause I never use it."
1,Corrupts hard drives,"Nice idea, but it doesn't really work!After finding the online tips about how to use this device (which were not included with the device), I got it to detect my IDE drive and was able to look at a few files. However, it soon came up with a write error (""Delayed Write Failed"") and disconnected. Upon trying to reconnect, it appears that it has corrupted the hard drive, which is now unreadable.I thought it might just be a fluke so I tried another drive, but it did exactly the same thing.This device is worse than useless: it corrupts good hard drives. After looking at other reviews, it also appears to be a safety hazard (producing fires, shocks and burns)."
2,Yet another go at the 2008 Crash,This is a disappointing Video. It is of course technically very good. But it fails to live up to its promise. The guru or main actor seems to have a lot to say but does not get it out. All these commentators behave as if Economics and Finance are great mysteries. They cannot explain the simple arithmetic nor what happened - After so long!!
2,"Great performance, but there's a better transfer","This is not the best transfer of this magnificent old Cetra recording, which stems from a live 1951 broadcast. The Italian record companies had discovered the so-called ""Cedar"" process in the 1990's, and they tended to over filter all of the live recordings and reissues of analog recordings they put out to deadening effect. Fortunately, Warner Fonit reissued this recording in a far superior transfer circa 2002 when they inherited the Cetra catalogue. Do an Amazon search and enter either of these so-called ASIN numbers, and you will find one of the incarnations of the Warner Fonit transfer:B003IO5IFMB000063UMMBear in mind that even Warner Fonit can only do so much with the Cetra's boxy 1951 mono sound, but they make it far more listenable than Cetra did."
2,Wireless presenter,"Unfortunately this item tries to do too many things and that is its downfall. The laser is not bright enough and drains the 2xAA batteries (would'nt last more than a day's meeting). The wireless mouse is difficult to control and will not replace a regular mouse - the only good feature is the powerpoint control for slide advancement and reversal- works great for that with the two neatly placed buttons. However, if you happen to touch the large central menu button (hard to avoid because of its size and central location) it reverses to ""mouse mode"" - the two buttons turn to right and left mouse buttons- result the slides will not then advance- if this happens during your presentation- takes some figuring out!THe poor battery life, weak laser and large and wrongly placed menu button make this an undesirable item- coupled with the fact that my first one blew out its circuit after 8 months (4 weeks for replacement and UPS costs)makes it an unrecommendable item."
3,Cute Little Mouse,It's a fairly small and sharp looking mouse. The design is pretty ergonomic but I've seem better. Swiveling USB receiver is pretty neat. It also comes with a three inch USB extension cable. Carrying pouch comes in pretty handy too.For some reason the right click button does not work for me. There might be some setting that I can tweak but havn't found it yet though. Their tech support have never replied my email.Another thing is that the on/off switch is at the under side of the mouse. Which is really bad since as you flip over the mouse to turn it off the red optical light could zap your eyes.
1,Dont buy,"Worst purchase ever made, full of flaws, buttons don't always response well, double clicking problems, right click problems. Customer support is useless. Targus only makes good laptop cases, forget about Targus hardware."
1,Junk!!!,"I ended up throwing it away. I couldn't deal with the frustration of using it! The laser kept turing itself off on its own. I thought it was the power switch, because that was VERY touchy and would move too far to make a good contact. I also thought the batteries were going bad, but I realized that the scroller and buttons would work, but not the laser for the mouse. This is the first review I have ever written because I wanted to warn people not to waste their money!"
1,Get something else,"The concept is great. But, the mouse itself sucks! The battery door is hard to take off and when you do get the door off it doesn't stay close. You have to use a small screw driver to click the plastic battery door in place. Their tech support sucks. They won't admit that the battery door is defective! Get the logitech mouse instead. Also, don't forget to buy a big box of batteries"
2,works for awhile and then drops connection,"This mouse worked well for about 2 weeks and then it kept losing the connection between the mouse and computer. Tried new batteries, etc. but nothing seemed to work. It's so frustrating that I no longer use it. This problem occurred on two different Dell laptops."
1,not worth the money,"First it won't work on the USB port and I had get a ps2 adaptor, then after 2 month the transmitter stopped working for no reason."
1,Disappointed,I had high expections of this mice but they never materialized. I tried to get this mouse to work with my new laptop but failed. The laptop recognized the transmitter but the mouse never connected. The user guide is very limited. Guess I shouldn't complain since I only paid $14.99. Guess I have to get a Logitech. I've tried another three of these but couldn't get them to work. I've given up on this product and plan to go with Logitech.
2,Low quality (inaccurate) and not designed for travel,"This mouse has poor accuracy and short battery duration. Sometimes it works fine, but most of the time the tracking is inaccurate, worst than a pad track. Also, throwing the mouse in a bag makes it transmit continuously (buttons pressed), and the batteries run empty soon (few days). I'd return it, but I let more than 30 days pass. I recommend you look for another solution. Finally, the transmitter sticks out of the USB port, and this makes it likely to break."
1,Don't waste money and time on this item,I bought this at $30 in the retail store. After a month it looses synch and couldn't return it to the retail store. I contacted customer service which does not answer. I would not waste money or time on this item.
5,This is great,This thing is so cool. You don't need messy wires and you can do it from a long way off. Very nice if you want to annoy people by clicking on everything while they are trying to work. A must buy.
2,buttons stick,"I'm disappointed in this remote. It worked well at first. After a few months, when I press the forward button, it would stick and forward through 2-20 images in rapid sequence. Also the USB receiver is quite bulky."
1,Save your money...,"The only time this presenter worked was when I was standing beside my computer. As a school teacher, that is not an option. I also found the buttons to be extremely confusing and the enclosed manual was absolutely NO help at all."
1,Do not buy this wireless mouse!,"I had a Logitech wireless notebok mouse, but the receiver broke and I needed a new mouse quickly. I bought this thing - what a mistake! The connection between the mouse and the usb receiver constantly ""breaks"". I have to remove the receiver from my laptop, turn off the mouse (button on bottom is VERY tiny), and then re-connect the receiver, turn on the mouse again, and push the re-set button on both the receiver and then the mouse. SOMETIMES that works. Other times, I have to completely re-boot my laptop.Also, I have gone through three sets of AAA batteries in three weeks.I have rarely written a review on Amazon, but wanted to warn others about this particular item. I am typing this on my laptop and just tried to use the mouse (yes, I still have it - haven't had time to get a new one and sometimes it's still better than my efforts at using the touch pad), and I have to re-connect it again.I wouldn't give this thing any stars, but you have to give at least one."
3,Irritating; Not worth of money,"I bought this targus mice for $10 but it is full of flaws. Opening battery latch is a terrible experience and this mouse goes to dormant now and then. Synchronizing is again a pain, each time you have to press infinitesimally small button in mouse and sometimes it take a while and may be frustating.Over all mouse size is also small and it dosnt fit nicely inside palm.My earlier logitech mouse was much much better in operation just a little heavy but one can ignore that factor.My good advice dont buy this mouse (even if it is for free) if want peace of mind."
3,Looks nice- but chintzy,"I received the Targus PAUM005 as a Christmas gift, but found it somewhat heavy due to the 2 AA batteries, and there is no on/off switch, so I decided to try the PAWM10U, which uses AAA. Unfortunately, the PAWM10U seems very chintzy. It clicks LOUDLY and the scroll wheel has too much play. The on/off switch is very tiny, you have to use a thumbnail, so it's not much more convenient than the tiny push button on the PAUM005. I'm going to return it and keep looking."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I've owned my wireless mouse for almost a year now and can't tell you how many times I've had to change batteries. I've already changed them 3 times in December. The mouse uses AAA batteries, so I always have to make a trip to the store. Not to mention, you have to pry the old batteries out with a knife or some sharp device. Today I finally had enough; I threw the mouse into the wall, shattering it into pieces. I will be sure to buy a new one that has a charger."
1,disappointed,"I heard good things about this product, but when I got it I found that it kept freezing my computer and the battery dies very quickly.I suggest you look for another product. This one does not work as it should."
2,"Worked for 1 year, but I am trying a Logitech now","I had to buy a new one, and I chose another brand (Logitech) this time.There is no On/Off button, so the batteries run out if you don't take them out (I think the buttons are pressed during transportation). Now the battery contacts are not functioning properly.And I had the same problem described in a recent review: ""I'll click three or four times and nothing happens. Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end. It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen."""
1,Only worked for a day,"Mine worked fine the first day, then my IBM ThinkPad simply did not seem to recognize when I plugged in the receiver to the USB port. The USB port works fine for other things."
1,This is what makes Internet shopping so awful,"They sent a different style than what is shown the picture. I see now that the product looks one way in the first two shots and another in the second two. Now I have something I don't want, but it isn't worth the time to send it back. Thanks for nothing!"
2,Don't do it!,"I got this presenter for using with Power Point presentations. It was easy to set up but that does you NO GOOD if you can't rely on it to work. It broke within a few uses. I returned the item to Targus and they replaced it with a defective unit - which would only move slides backwards. When I tried to resolve the issue with them and get a working replacement, they suggested that it was user error. I will not buy a targus product again. The middle of a presentation is not when I want to discover that a presenter is unreliable!"
1,DON'T BUY,"DID NOT WORK, because two of the four wires were severed inside the device. Thanks a bunch for this piece of crap. Sold by: Bazingaroo"
3,Works but is a compromise,"I wanted a wireless mouse to end the clutter of using my notebook and to be able to easily put it in my pocket when I walk away from the computer and it is in public. I wanted one that uses batteries instead of recharging in a stand because, well, I wanted to get rid of clutter and have one less thing to worry about lugging around. This mouse fills the bill. But I had to make a compromise to poor battery life to get it.The first one died in 2 weeks so I got an exchange, just a hassel. The next one was eating batteries so I got a replacment. The third one is almost as bad. Battery usage may be a function of my use of rechargables but I turn it off when not in use and use it on top of a white sheet of paper which Targus tech support told me would increase battery life. I also get some irratic behavior when the computer is doing other things like loading graphics but this may be a function of its being a USB mouse instead of PS/2."
1,Yes - worst product ever...,"I wish I read the reviews before I bought this thing, unfortunately. Extremely user unfriendly to connect and disconnects itself often; kills batteries even in sleep mode.The size and precision is good when it does work, but definitely not worth the money. I exchanged it for a new one thinking it was just the first unit, but still terrible."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE,"please do not purchase this mouse. i've had it for 2 months now, and i have left it off when im not using it (around 8-10 hours per day) but i've been to costco to buy 6 packs of AAA Batteries already. Battery eater. the battery cover snapped off after 3 weeks. The radio receiver thing stops receiving all of a sudden in the middle of nowhere, and i have to stand up, pull back my monitor (i have a laptop, with an unfortunate 17 inch screen) and reset everything. i would highly recommend any of the logitechs..which has a charging stand... but not targus. the only reason i gave it a one is because you can't choose zero stars."
3,presenter remote,the product works perfect but the picture is not the same one as the product i received.
2,Short Range Mouse,"Bought this wireless mouse hoping to use it on the arm of my recliner. My TV sits about 7 ft from the chair. This mouse wouldn't work at all unless within 4-5 ft of the transmitter. If you're looking for a wireless mouse to use with your home theatre PC setup, this isn't the one. Otherwise its perfect for travelling, so we're keeping it and it goes in the miscellaneous junk pile."
2,"Too heavy, too slow, too power-hungry -- not worth the $$","I tried this mouse to see if I could avoid using my touchpad. Although it installed easily, movement was often jerky and slow. CRITICAL FOR ME: It drained my laptop battery much faster than normal. Also, if your USB port puts the receiver/dongle within sight, the blue light that flickers and flashes with every mouse movement is very distracting. With its batteries installed, this mouse is HEAVY! If total carry-around weight is an issue for you, or if you don't want your laptop battery drained, this isn't the right mouse for your ensemble. I took mine back for a refund."
1,Don't buy,I've also had a lot of trouble with this mouse.1. The receive range is very short and seems to be blocked by my laptop screen.2. It doesn't respond sometimes after the computer is restarted.3. You need to remove the batteries to avoid running them down. It needs an on/off switch.There are much better travel mice out there. I'm going from an optical mouse with a cord for better reliability.
1,"Bad quality clicker, big mistake to buy one","The pointer was disappointment from the opening of the package, feels so flimsy, and switches and buttons so out of place. After turning on, the normal assumed button function didn't work on Windows XP. Advancing Power Point slides required ""left"" button, reverse used ""bottom"" button. Expected arrangement was forward with ""right"" button and reverse with ""left"" button. The mouse pointer absolutely useless, can see where it moves. Laser pointer just a battery drain, it so week, so no one can see it on bright projection screen anyway. And finally after four times use it QUIT, started to shine laser all the time and not responding to clicks at all. Now need to find out how to get money back without that plastic packaging, that must be destroyed to get it out."
1,Misleading Title,"This book does not describe aircraft guns; it supplies a listing of which aircraft used guns of various types, and it gives short descriptions of the aircraft. There are no details about gun installations, problems, or performance in the aircraft listed. Aircraft guns are chosen for definite reasons, but the book does not give any of these reasons.There are many errors in the book. For example, three of the four photo captions on page 28 are incorrect.With its lack of information and simplistic descriptions, the book seems to written for older children. A second edition with errors corrected might be a worthwhile addition to an elementary or junior high school library. It is not worthwhile for a knowledgable adult."
4,Great for my teenagers!,"My teenager now wants to be a pilot, and he bought this book for that reason. For him, it was great. An overview of fighter pilotage, but without the details that would bore him and turn him off. He has read it at least six times, and loves the pictures."
1,An unusually poor book from a quality publisher,"I was extremely disappointed with what seemed to be a promising idea. There is far too much information on the aircraft (much of it not pertaining to the title topic), and not enough on the guns, their function, and their installation. Photo choices are also often inappropriate for the topic, and there are an unsettling number of typos and omissions. (For instance, the B-47 is listed, but the description makes NO mention of its defensive armament!) In addition, the period before World War II, when many of the precepts of aircraft armament were first developed, is glossed over in far too few pages. No, Schiffer usually produces excellent products, but this is NOT one of them, and I am sorry I purchased this book."
5,Simply a Pleasure!,"The consumate performer comes through with outstanding musicians and an updated sound. Some terrific new songs and old favorites. Even my kids enjoy this tape, watching all of the incredible musicians like Richard Bona and dancing along with the upbeat classics like ""Matilda"" and ""Kwela (Listen to the Man)."" I saw Harry Belafonte perform last night and he can still belt them out at age 74! Trust me, this is a quality production."
1,Big disappintment,"I'm a big fan of Harry Belafonte and the disappintment was great, when I saw the concert."
3,Does what it's supposed to,Nothing bad or good to say about it. It's a basic mouse pad and have no complaints. It does get used every day but not a ton of use.
3,Book Synopsis,"Publication Date: 5/1/1987Book Description:One thing led to another ...It was shocking enough for Dina Pappas to discover her dead husband had been a criminal. Now she was suspected of being one, too.When Ran Constantine was assigned to investigate, Dina was prepared for a fight - not for the passion that surged between them. But neither could forget the real reason he had entered her life.The only solution was to clear her name, and so they followed the clues that led them to Greece. There they might find a new beginning - but chances were, it could mean the end ..."
1,Major Rip-Off,"I bought this DVD because I love to watch figure skaters. I have many of the performances on this DVD on old video tapes, but wanted them all in one DVD, so I'd have them in one place, easily indexed, so I could find each performance without having to fast forward. Well, was I mistaken. This so-called DVD is actually more a video CD. There are no extras, and there isn't a menu. They didn't even put chaptering on the thing so you could skip to the beginning of each performance, so I'm still stuck fast-forwarding through the DVD to get to what I want to watch. And splitting the set into two volumes was just a way for the greedy to scam more money. Both volumes would easily have fit on one DVD, with room to spare for extras that weren't included. I gave this one star because Amazon doesn't give an option for zero stars. It really deserved a negative one."
3,Highs and Lows,"I was thrilled to get this DVD of performances but it's disappointing that there's no menu and you can't simply go to one performance. Still, the viewer gets a great overview of historical moments in the sport and epic performances from figure skating's greatest champions."
2,"It's O.K., but not great","I agree with most of the reviewers--it would have been nice to have a menu and be able to click through the performances to see a particular skater. I wonder if the producers made it first for video and then just recorded it on DVD without any changes.Truly, forwarding through the DVD would be great for my daughter. She's a figure skater and wants to analyze different performances.What was really frustrating was the way they built up the two Carmens (Katerina Witt and Debi Thomas), but didn't show much of Debi's performance. It would have been nice to compare the two."
1,major ripoff,"Both volumes 1 and 2 are a major ripoff. There is less than one hour of film on each DVD, which could hold 6 hours or more. The clips are short and only show part of the performances. Most of the DFD is blather from the commentators. I was so disappointed I almost cried. Where is Sasha Cohen, the greatest skater who ever lived?"
3,"good, but repetitive","I thought this book was useful, but repetitive with ""Leave the office earlier"". I read this book first, a few weeks before ""Find more time"", and she uses several of the same examples in both books. As an employed mom, I wish I had just read ""Leave the office earlier"" (which I found very useful) and not wasted my time with the same advice in ""Find more time"". However, if you are an unemployed individual, you may find ""Find more time"" better than ""Leave the office earlier"". Overall, good, but only read one or the other."
3,like the other time managing books,"This book focusses more on getting the home managed, but it is like alot of others that I have read. Unless you put into practice the lessons in these books they do no good. So just get up and do it. Try [...] this is a good time managing site. It works for homes as well as for offices. Teaching you how to form routines and good habbits."
4,time management,Enjoyed the author's slant on time management. Have read lots of books on it and used some of the tips found in this book.
4,Good bike for the $$,"I recently purchased this bike and I am very satisfied with it. For a $100 I paid for it on Amazon it all I expected it to be. The only thing I changed was the saddle, as it was a little hard for my butt. I am not sure why previous reviewer had problems with his bike. It could be just defective bikes he purchased or just some who doesn't like to read assembly instructions. If you want a decent, inexpensive bike for an occasional ride, just go for it."
2,Kawasaki Bike Review,"Most of the bike was already put together, but the instructions to finish assembling the bike weren't very clear. I ended up tossing the instructions and just screwing stuff in where it seemed to fit. Either the bike is crappy or I didn't put it together very well. The petal has already fallen off, I thought I screwed it in right, but it's possible I could've cross-threaded it. Yeah, either this bike is crap or I'm just a moron who didn't put it together right. If your not very handy it's probably best to get someone else to put a bike together or buy one that's already assembled."
2,just a kids bike,i found this bike to be well made but heavy the components very poor i sold it within a weekb
5,"A Stroll Down Memory Lane in ""The Prince of Central Park""","While the movie is dated and somewhat naive, it is still an endearing story of how Central Park was able to bring together a homeless brother and sister, with a lonely but loving elderly woman, longing for ""family"" to be in her life again.There are beautiful scenes filmed all over the Park, and for native New Yorkers (ex or current), and for those who have simply visited the city and Park at some time, the movie is a reminder of how special and unique Central Park is."
3,"Despite some problems, a solid, interesting mystery","I actually ended up enjoying this mystery. I had an idea of how part of the mystery would play out, but I did not guess the full story until the end was revealed. I enjoyed the twists and the turns, and I liked the sub-stories. However, my real problem came with what the author was trying to achieve with the two main characters. I couldn't decide whether or not I actually liked the character of Kat, or whether Tom was going to be a regular character in any future books, so I didn't want to become attached. I was also left with a sort of vague depressed feeling about the two characters, and about the author's outlook on religion, or at least the religious life, in general. So, the mystery part was good, but the two main characters left me scratching my head."
3,I like the main character,"I like the main character, a female Anglican priest. I'm always happy to revisit her adventures when I find a new book in her series. I do find them a little hard to get into and the plots a bit convoluted."
2,"good idea, bad ventilation","i own 2 ps3s. 1 is in the living room and it ventilates fine, no problems. the other is in this. and it has a tendancy to overheat. and when i say tendancy i mean everytime i don't have the fan pointed at it. the problem is that the lip on the bottom prevents the exhausted air from moving away from the ps3. so i had to use a dremel to get rid of the lip and it has been ok ever since. its a good idea but needs some work."
2,"not necessary, almost scratches ps3","I bought this, and it's really not worth the money, its made from cheap sharp plastic and doesn't help you all that much. I would just pass this over if I were you. It also holds the dvds extremely tight, and the ps3 games dont fit well. Blu-ray movies do though."
3,Nice Book - strange words,"This is a nicely produce volume with numerous photographs that are very evocative of the period. The content is good with a great deal of unique historical information and background on the personalities. I found the text, however, to be difficult to read, due to the unusual use of the english language. I feel this valuable work would be much improved through more detailed editing. Nevertheless, I feel this volume remains essential reading to any student of early motoring history."
5,Once More With Feeling,Awesome musicality! Real smooth. Great trumpet instrumentation. Great to hear the true big band sound again. Let me know when the next CD is out.
5,Once More With Feeling,Awesome musicality! Real smooth. Excellent trumpet instrumentation. Real refreshing to hear the true big band sound again. Let me know when there's another CD!
4,An All-Round Excellent PS3 Carrying Case,"After buying a PS3 I knew that getting a proper case for it would be an important investment. I saw this case at Target and decided to buy it because of the good looks and quality build of the bag.The case does an excellent job holding the PS3 console in its padded compartment. It has two outside pockets that hold your controllers and an interior pocket that has ample room to hold the power cable, HDMI cable, optical audio cable, USB cable, and games.While taking my PS3 to my cousin's house for Thanksgiving, I was able to fit all of the items listed above in addition to 8 games (with the cases) in the bag.Overall, I'm happy with the case and I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the build. Are there cheaper alternatives? Absolutely! But all in all, I'm happy with the case. It's solid, well made, and well padded.I have no regrets with purchasing this item. Odds are, you will agree."
4,"a pretty good bag, but it could use just a little more room","As soon as I got this bag I tried to put all of my PS3 stuff in it. The main pocket holds the ps3 very well and is nice and soft and cushioned. The next pocket, I suppose is for games, is VERY skinny because the ps3 in the main pocket squishes in on it; it's a strech to put more than 4 games in it. The outer most pocket can hold 2 controllers comfortably and if you really don't mind a tight fit, 4 controllers can be crammed in. I also shoved the power cable, a couple usb cables for charging controllers, the component cables and an hdmi cable in the side mesh pockets and other nooks and crannies in the main part. I am pretty happy with the bag overall, and even though it is nice how suprisingly compact the bag is, I would have liked just a little more space so it wasn't such a tight fit to put in 4 controllers and more than 4 games. Oh, and there isn't any padding on the shoulder strap."
3,Good vacation read,"Some of the stories lines have been told before, nothing new, but made my time on a train go by quickly."
3,It's an o.k. read,"This is a skimmer, skipper. Seemed to go on forever--wish I could return it. Six more words required, one two."
3,Took me by surprise,"I felt the beginning of the book was difficult since I couldn't possibly imagine how the stories could combine. I was also surprised that I could finish such a long book. In the end, the stories become amazingly intertwined with characters that become lifelong friends. This was a good read. Surprisingly I really enjoyed the German character, his conflicts and his decisions. The characters were well developed and seemed to mature even as I read about them. Good story..."
3,challenging,"It was a little hard to follows with characters changing each chapter. Also, it challenged you to remember which character was which. The story was interesting even if hard to follow."
2,Small town characters,"I grew up in a small town and related well to the characters that matched those persons that I knew. However, the slowness of the read was boring after a while and this was my biggest gripe."
4,Great historical romance,I really enjoyed this book. I especially like the history it described and the development of the characters. It would make a great movie.
3,sentimental journey: i guess you just have...,"sentimental journey: i guess you just have to be in the right frame of mind to read this story. the storyline seemed interesting enough, but for some reason i got bored with it by page 52. and this is surprising to me, since i'm a big fan of romance and romance-comedy genre movies. i'll just have to put it on my shelf with the ""to read"" books."
3,NOT AUTOMATIC!,"This retractable cord is advertised as ""automatic"", but you have to release the extended cord with a button. Also, the plug is too big for a phone jack, so check what you order it for."
1,They don't last,"Purchased these for my garage door opener. I was having to go pretty close to my garage door before it would open and thought new batteries would do the trick. After installing the new batteries my range increased tremendously... FOR TWO DAYS! Then my range fell back to the way it was before installing these. Could it be a defect in my remote thats sucking the life out of batteries? Possibly, but seems like they would be dead in no time if this were the case."
3,So far so good - 3 stars because I need to see it's long lasting performance,"So far so good - 3 stars because I need to see it's long lasting performanceThis review may not be helpful, because it only makes sense that I review at the end of life, but it's only be a couple of weeks. But so far so good. No complaints."
3,Try and Avoid any devices that use these batteries. They are too small to last very long,"I am sure that the battery is as efficient as possible. They are jut too small to power anything for very long however. My issue is with the devices that require these small, 12 volt, batteries. I would prefered to have a device that used larger, long lasting, more readily available, batteries than to have to hunt down and purchase this oddball battery on-line. In the futrure I will avoid purchasing any devices that use these batteries."
5,Quick delivery,Product came quickly and was exactly what I needed. Good price too. Couldn't find these at any store in my area.
1,I gave it up.. awful experience..,I recently moved when I bought this battery and asked them to send the battery to my new address. They said they will. It took a month to get their feedback and they explained the battery came back to them because I moved. They told me they will send one again to me. That thing never came to me regardless what they said. They insisted to resend the batteries again to my old address which I don't understand why. Ugh..I finally bought those batteries from the one of grocery markets in my town and decide to stop begging them to give me the batteries.
1,The batteries I bought lasted less than one month,"I bought a package of two A23 batteries as replacements for the one that died in my garage door opener. The first one I put in only lasted as long as two uses. Thinking it was just a defective battery, I put the other one in. It lasted as long as about 8-10 uses. Good thing I was at Auto Zone that same day and they had one pack left of the A23 batteries. Yes, I paid the full retail price, but at least I haven't been let down since I put them in about 2 months ago. I don't know how you check battery life before you buy batteries online, but I guess you just take that risk."
5,a23 battery review,Item works great. Not sure how long it will last yet as I just started using them for the remote that comes with the wireless outlet 3 pack.
3,batteries,"How do you write a review on batteries. They fit, they work and hopefully they last longer than the cheap ones that I had before."
2,Too Expensive,"I have discovered the Tenergy bulk packed 123 batteries... basically 50 cents a battery, holy deal batman! No need for energizer anymore."
4,Right one,"I can't find this at a regular store, so went to Amazon to search for this. Luckily found and delivered quickly. It's for my fan remote control."
5,"Energizer A23 Battery, 12 Volt - 2 Pack","Great deal on these batteries, shipped quickly. These 12 volt batteries are sometimes hard to find. the price was right!"
4,Batteries Work!,"I bought 2 sets of batteries (different brand) already, one at Wallmart and the other at Meijers, neither of which worked. These were exactly like the ones I took out of my garage door opener and they are working fine!"
5,Works like a battery,"Battery nuance is unknown to me. However, my wireless doorbell battery needed to be replaced. After inserting the new battery, replacing the ringer cover, and pressing the ringer button I hear the doorbell. Success!"
5,Great Service! Great Product!,I could not believe the great service I received. The battery works great and arrived right away. Sure beats calling store after store to see if they carried this particular product. It's not an easy product to find.
2,Does it tell you what you need to know?,"I had recently read this book when I had a road accident in Portugal. Fortunately what followed was the opposite to what I could expect based on the book I had read. The book had left me with a picture of badly equipped hospitals and poor health care. On the way to casualty I feared the worst. To my amazement I received prompt attention, service was very efficient and courteous. I feel that this must be known in fairness to the Portuguese people who may be trying their best and in fairness to people like me, the foreigners, who may be unduly discouraged from enjoying this charming land. On health matters, as on others 'Living and working in Portugal: all you need to know to enjoy life in Portugal' may frighten you away rather than tell you 'what you need to know'. On accident emergency services, and other matters, this book may be relying more on preconceptions, not on facts. better take it with a grain of salt!"
1,Rather weak,"This is the first book I came across on the subject, and bought, but disappointment lead me to search further and then I found two good alternatives. This book has several problems. Some pages are simply filled with useless information, referenced addresses do not appear to have been researched and most are useless or do not exist at all. On top of all this, you feel bitter because you get very little for what you have paid and you end up by not trusting anything in the book. With Holtom's Working and living: Portugal and another one, Live and work in Spain and Portugal, by Pybus and White, you get better value for money."
4,Good source for thinking about your further education,I am very happy with this book. It has given me food for thought about where I would like to take my desire for lifelong learning.
1,A Scattershot Approach,"Please, don't waste your money on this book. Check it out from the library if you must, but know that it takes a very, very scattershot approach to what is essentially a great books reading program.The author's choices are often poor, both in recommended material and approach- for example, there is no reason to chide us not to read our email in the morning, yet because this doesn't work for the author, well, by God, it doesn't work at all.I would strongly suggest looking around at university courses on Great Books, browsing their syllabi, and developing your own program instead. It will be a better use both of time and energy."
5,IQ,"Our grandson just finished ""A History of the Ancient World"" by this author and enjoyed it so much that he wanted to read more of her books. An excellent author."
1,A Definite Religious Bias,"I am greatly disappointed in the content as it has (in my opinion), a tendency to steer the reader in a direction that conveys the authors bias to a christian base of interest. I do not object to Ms. Bauers ideas, but I believe it would have given the option to know her evangelical background as to whether I would consider her information on what she considers a list of books to read that constitutes a ""well educated mind."" After reading with some consternation, up to page 157, I decided to google Susan Wise Bauer and found that of course she is an Evangelical Christian English instructor at the college of William and Mary. I am not interested in reading any further books of hers for this reason. Someone else may be and that is great. I'm saying somewhere in the reviews I would have been interested in knowing this. This is my opinion.R.Leonard"
2,not what i thought it would be,"i was deceived by the title. it was mostly a reading guide and not some sort of survey of the ""classics."" plus, i've read better reading guides"
4,Very good book,"Helpful and very well organized. The author takes a very daunting task (to become ""well read"" and classically educated) and truly encourages and motivates the reader.She offers her lists which, she explains, are just a starting point and not exhaustive. They are set up chronologically and she encourages the reader to make the lists their own by adding to or subtracting from the list.She also offers her perspective and insight on how to accomplish the task at hand. For instance, she doesn't read her email prior to starting a serious reading. Her analysis of the issue hit the nail on the head.I also appreciated the fact the author didn't re-write history by removing the Christian writings from her lists. Brava!"
3,Talking about ironies...,"A nation would seem to be in trouble if the supposedly educated portion of its population are writing book reviews with words like ""aliteracy"" such as did reviewer D Becker.It just shows one should never put much store in print."
3,big knitting needles,"These needles work okay but they are plastic and pretty lightweight; I'm used to metal needles so these seem, almost like a toy. Wanted the size 19 needle and couldn't find them anywhere in town, so had to order them. They are ok, I just prefer the metal knitting needles."
3,Decent,"Bass Creations first album appeared to be the start of something serious as most artists tend to improve or fail by the second or third album. With their albums, consistency has been quite sporadic as they seem to lose touch in what sounds good and venture too far from Volume 1. Each album will have at least one or two hits and the rest epic failure! I don't bother with buying ""The best of"" in anyone's series as you often don't get the best, just a few popular songs and the rest fillers. Volume 1 is still a collectible since you won't find some of the songs elsewhere just like the rest of their albums. Just don't get your hopes up in finding the rest consistent with Volume 1."
2,Not Worth The Money,"It does NOT clean grout as well as it advertises. If you get this machine, please be careful with caulking...you can damage it quite easily. Because it damaged my caulk, I found it difficult to clean my shower with it because well, there's caulk in there and it gets dirty too!! The only thing I use it for now is to clean the outside parts of the toilet. Soap scum doesn't come off...My windows and mirrors do not get clean. The manual is a piece of trash so even if this machine could do something, you're on your own to find out how.The plastic seems cheap, the attachments damage easily...It is a horrible feeling when you open the box and just know that you've been had. Don't waste your money!!!"
4,very entertaining,"as amusing as the title would suggest. picked this up off my friend's coffee table with a laugh over the weekend, after initially mistaking it for the Joyce namesake.a great meld of highbrow/lowbrow, completely irreverant of course. excellent book to read a chapter from when you need something fun to change your train of thought. imagine these guys had a good time writing this..."
2,Fairy Realm: The Water Sprites,"I got this book out from the library because of it's beautiful color, but its lack of creativity & simplicity totally threw me off. The story is about a girl named Jessie who is invited to a special party in the ""Fairy Realm"" when on the way she meets a few water sprites. So on, but half way through the book I was bored, confused, and frusterated. I recomend this book for someone who has a good amount of patience."
5,Worked well,"This part worked well for me. The quality seems good, and although it requires some assembly the instructions were adequate, and I had no problems. Keep in mind that although some of the Monroe shock absorbers show a dust boot like this in the picture, they do not include it."
1,Not a good product,The bumper rubber that came with it does not fit to the strut rod. Lots of modification needs to be made to use this product. I am unhappy.
3,Great Product! Difficult to Fit!,"This was not a perfect match and was kind of difficult to figure out how to install.The boot itself was very easy, it is the inner bushing that was the problem."
3,Good info but not engaging,"This book does have some good information, but none of my students (age 9-13) found it very interesting. It sat unopened during my classes. They got much more use out of the book Draw Real Animals by Lee Hammond."
4,Great Book,"Great book. Even my 11 year olds art teacher at school asked to borrow it. Makes harder things to draw easy with a great ""break down"" approach."
5,"If you can read, then you can draw using the simple concepts taught in this book!","I got this as a gift for my 9 year old son. After two weeks, I have noticed a huge improvement in his sketches. This book is helping him to perfect his creative talent!"
2,"Deceptive Title, way too advanced for kids.","I ordered this book for my 8 year old grandson who loves to draw. The title said this book was for kids, and showed pictures of children around his age on the cover and back cover.When the book arrived I was totally dissapointed. It would be hard for an adult to use this book let alone a child, at least in my opinion. I think it is way too advanced for kids. I thought the techniques would be more basic, and easier for children to follow.This book might be good for pre-teens or teens who have lots of artistic talent in them already, but for the average child who just likes to have fun drawing I thought it was way too advanced."
5,Great kids' art book,"My 11-year old son loves to draw. His skills are self taught, and he has checked out MANY books from the library over the years. He recently checked out this book and declared it one of the best he'd ever seen. (I bought it from Amazon for a Christmas present.) Even though he already understands shading, perspective, etc., he thought this book helped him improve even more. The book also has a lot on drawing people and faces, which can be very challenging."
4,Very good but NOT the Pumpkins,"If you're a fan of indie guitar rock, this album is a must-have. It's solid, with universally good songs and performances. Even ""Lazy Eye,"" their obligatory radio-friendly track, is superb. They're interesting and non-conformist without being annoying and pretentious.On the downside, the production edges over the line of ""charming"" and into ""sloppy."" It's a slight deficiency, however, and unless you're finicky and listen on a high-end audio system, you probably won't notice."
4,Good to hear...,"Short but sweet, I'm just going to say that If you like Sunny Day Real Estate, Fire Theft or anything by Jeremy Egnik and the work of The Smashing Pumpkins, you'll definetly enjoy this band. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's damn better than some of the cheesier rock thats out today. I recommend!Best Tracks:Lazy Eye - Well thought out Twinkles - Checkered Floor - Melatonin"
5,Great Record,It even came with a free online download for your mp3 player! Couldn't ask for any more than what I got.
5,wow,"this is quite lovely. just let it play. if i put it on and listen it is just okay. if i put it on and let it play and don't focus so much i'm all of a sudden taken away, esp tracks 2 and 7. again, an acquired taste. but well worth the wait."
5,awesome,"one of the best albums ive heard this year so far from an indie alternative group this year, along with Band of Horses. awesome."
5,hot new band before MTV got to it,mos def a cd that can be enjoyed more and more everytime you listen to it. we will see how their next one fares after MTV got ahold of them....:(
2,Derivative to the extreme,"Wow. Have to agree with the few others on here that are aghast at the popularity and positive reviews of this band. They sound like a Holiday Inn-style Smashing Pumpkins cover band--if said cover band consisted of 15-year olds. But be clear: the Pickups' can't play with anywhere NEAR the ferocity and/or virtuosity of either the Pumpkins' Billy Corgan or Jimmy Chamberlain.I may be only one of a few that finds this disgraceful--but unless you're a 13 year old girl or have never heard of the Smashing Pumpkins (in which case you should definitely buy that stuff first) -- keep moving on past this one. These guys should never have even been signed to a record deal--it's a travesty unoriginality like this is rewarded.Oh well. No matter. In a year this band will be long forgotten like all the other previous Pumpkins' rip-off bands (Abandoned Pools, etc.) were."
5,Fantastic,"I love this cd. There aren't many cd's out there that I can listen to over and over again, but this is one of them. I do agree that this does have a smashing pumpkins feel to it. These songs were well written and are all very enjoyable. They have another cd coming out soon and I hope it's just as good or even better than carnavas."
4,Smashing Pumpkins comparison is fair but.....,"I understand some of the comparisons to the Smashing Pumpkins, but I don't necessarily like the comparison. The Pumpkins were a much more accomplished group with many more albums. Some of the distorted guitar and high-pitched vocals lend themselves to these comparisons but the Pumpkins kicked your butt from the get-go. Silversun Pickups are not going to appeal to as wide of an audience. ""Lazy-Eye"" is a great song, although I'm sad to see that they already sold it out for a commercial.Matt Zarnstorff"
1,readymade for commercial radio,"I had a friend play this in a car on a long trip recently and I had no pre conceived notions about this band, I'd only heard their name once. But I was appalled at what I heard. Low rent Smashing Pumpkin rip offs, and a bland generic appeal that obviously has done them well. I'm sure everyone is going to get all up in arms about this and press ""NOT HELPFUL"" but honestly, this is one of the most unoriginal, sterile and void albums I've heard in years."
1,"One good song, the rest blows.",All the songs are very similar and annoying. There was one good song on the whole cd. Would not recommend.
3,Fresh start for Johnstone,"I'm happy with a new series by Johnstone. The plot was somewhat realistic, given this book was written well before the 9/11 event. Terrorists plot to kill the President, and many Americans in NYC, for the PLF (People's Liberation Front)'s cause. The new hero is John Barrone, along with other ex-Federal, State agents. They train together in West Texas and track the PLF from L.A., across country to NYC. They also must keep quiet about who they are to the FBI, CIA...etc. Lots of action, but little character development give this novel 3 stars. However, am impressed that Bill does not preach his philosophy every other chapter as in the Ashes series, and some of his more recent books like Breakdown. Although, I agree with most of that philosophy, we just want a good story. Looking forward to reading the next book."
2,Big Disappointment,"After reading and enjoying dozens of Johnstone's novels, this is the worst he has written. His horror and westerns are his finest and his action/adventure is second. He needs to focus more on character development and more realistic scenarios. Does the FBI and CIA really act like a bunch of amateurs? Where are their high-tech devices?"
5,"I hate to be negative, but...","...i'm afraid anyone who bought this album thinking it was a Morrissey album is not that bright or extremely inattentive. and i'm surprised they would announce their lack of sense to the world by writing a ridiculously angry review of the album.anyway, this album IS like getting a mixtape from Morrissey. that's the point! so if that appeals to you, it's a reasonably good buy."
1,Truly Disappointed,"Morrissey, I bought this album with the anticipation of further solo work. This reissue and repackage (of other bands) was not what I had in mind. Being a long term fan, I have come to accept the rebundling of your songs. However, this is a completely different story. Also, your bit about joining the other martyrs is ludicrious. How can you confuse self inflicted drug overdoses with martyrdom? No disrespect intended. (I know they were great and it is too bad they're gone.) How about this: Get in the studio and sing your life. I relish the old and hope you get inspired to release again. Until then..........................."
1,This is no Morrissey album!,"I thought this was, at last, a new Morrissey album, but actually it is just a compilation of songs by artists that inspired Morrissey. Needless to say, I am very disappointed!"
1,Copy protection scheme crashes your computer. Stay away,"I haven't even listened to this CD, and won't it goes back to Amazon on Monday. I put it in my computers DVD drive to listen to it, computer froze up. I didn't know it was the CD, so rebooted, computer wouldn't reboot. Wouldn't boot in safe mode. Booted with last known good config, it booted, as soon as you try to access the CD, explorer crashes. Computer won't boot with CD in drive, if you put the CD in the drive your computer hangs.Not only am I owed a refund, but compensation for the time I wasted with this CD. In FINE print, and I mean 6 point font on the back of the inside cover, it says ""This CD will not play on PC's or Macs."" Tell us that up front so we can save some bother."
3,buyer beware! this great music can't be copied.,"I was really pleased with the music--once I was able to listen to it. I originally tried it on my laptop and then the computer at my office. I thought that it might be a bad CD. When I tried it in my car, it worked. I read the very fine print and found a notice that says that the CD is copy protected and won't play on a computer. I wish Amazon had told me this, because I wouldn't have bought it. I don't actually own a CD player and I listen to all my music in iTunes.The music is eye-opening and fantastic... too bad I can't ever listen to it."
3,"Basically, a glorified mix tape","I love Moz. As many people have pointed out, under the influence is not his new cd of solo work (that would be 'you are the quarry'), but rather a compilation of artists who influenced his own work. I don't the packaging is really deceptive, but I knew what it was before I bought it. If you really like Morrissey, or want to be exposed to some interesting music, go ahead and buy it. I got it used, and I don't think I'd pay full price for it."
4,"It's a compilation, friends! Here are the artists:","Sundown Playboys, New York Dolls, Nat County, Diana Dors, Ludus, Charlie Feathers, Tyrannosaurus Rex, Jimmy Radcliffe, Jaybee, Ramones, Sparks, The Cats, Nico, Patti Smith, Klaus Nomi.Perhaps some confusion could have been avoided if Amazon had listed the names of the artists alongside the track titles.I really enjoy this collection. It features some artists I've known by name for ten years or more (via Moz interviews) but would never have heard without this CD. The sequencing is terrible: I don't think Stephen Patrick Morrissey will ever join Andy Rourke on the DJ circuit, but it isn't a big distraction. And all I can say about supporting militant animal rights groups is: ""Hell, yeah!"""
4,excellent resource for understanding BPD,"As a person struggling with BPD, I really appreciated the validating tone of this book. DBT is the BEST!!! It will get you back on track!!"
2,Informative but Disappointing,"This book is loaded with an abundance of information and list of resources. If you are reading it for that purpose, you?ve found a gold mind.I bought this book hoping to find new concrete help for family members of those with bpd. I was disappointed.The chapter for the family started great, but stopped too soon. Also, the book appeared to contradict itself when it denounced boundary setting by family members when it had suggested some great books on boundaries in the self-help chapter.I found the book, Imperfect Harmony by Coleman, to repeat the good points of the New Hope. However, that book went beyond this one with depth, compassion, challenging questions for reflection, and concrete steps. He points out the benefits of his advice for both the spouse suffering from a mental illness such as BPD as well as their spouse and their children."
5,Very concise...wonderful!,"I have read other books on Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), but I think that this is the best one yet!Some mainstream books on this disorder are too technical to be understood by the lay person. Even though I am a mental health professional, the book was really concise and also quite entertaining! This book is also a good reference guide, and provides a wonderful summary for people who are new to learning about this disorder.So, if you think you have BPD or know someone who has it, I highly recommend this book. Worth every penny!"
5,Christmas gift,"My husband gave me this pendant as a gift for Christmas and I LOVE it! The mother-of-pearl is bright without being flashy. The garnet makes a lovely contrast and the piece is the perfect size. Not to big to look gaudy, but not to small to get lost with your outfit."
2,shortcoming of the MK770,"Im a remodaling contractor and depend on all my tool to work.I purchased this saw as a back-up saw for my MK101.This saw has limited capacity on miter cuts due to motor is to close to the sliding table. It is under powered for hard tiles and stone, Also the rip guide did not line up at all, as on my other MK saw, the motor arbor bearing neede to be replaced after the first month.It will spray a lot of water outthe back. It is very loud for a small saw, due to the motor seams to bea modified angle grinder.Any one looking for a good tile saw should buy a MK 101."
3,"good saw, but...","I purchased the MK 770 not so long ago. The saw works really great, good cuts ect... . This machine does spray a lot of water, so, I decided to buy the ""water hood"" from MK Diamond, specifically for the 770. This item was pretty pricey, $150.00 to be honest. I figured I will be reciving a very ridgid hood that will stand up on the job site. Wow! was I wrong, and angry, too. I recived this flimsy piece of plastic that, if the wind blew over 5 mph it would tear in two. I can not believe MK Diamond would sell this crappy accessory, and for $150.00 no less. This hood can not cost more than $0.75 to make, literally.I e-mailed MK Diamond on their water hood, asking them how could they justify charging $150.00 for this thing, and letting them know I was very dissatisfied with this accessory. That was months ago... haven't heard back from them.I would give the saw 5 stars but,the water hood? I just can not get over."
4,Great Appetizers!,"The recipes in this book are wonderful. I made 3 of them for a baby shower, and they all were hits. Many can be done ahead of time, which is wonderful, and many have unique flavors and also create a beautiful presentation."
2,ok. not as good as the other two,yeah its ok a couple of good songs but nothing as memorable as the other two albums.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"After being disappointed with half of the season 2 Grey's Anatomy soundtrack CD, I almost didn't order Season 3, but I figured I needed to have the complete collection. Some of my favorites songs from the season are included--""Young Folks"", ""Sealion"", ""A Cold Wind Blows through Your Door"", ""Running on Sunshine"", ""Come to Me"", and ""Keep Breathing"". While I wished several other favorites were on the CD, I like the remainder of the tracks well enough to listen to them and let them grow on me."
3,mediocre,"I really love this show and the music is usually awesome. This cd, however, is just so-so. Not the greatest mix."
5,Greys volume 3 CD,3rd Volume of Greys Anathomy is as good as the first two. The only trouble is trying to remember where the music comes into the scene being shown as you don't hear the music first time round as you are too busy watching what is happening on screen. When the reruns come round you will be able to co-ordinate the music in your head to the scene on screen. A good buy for a brilliant show.Alison
5,up lifting,i felt as though this album really bless my heart. hearing the kids worship god in a very beautiful and heartfelt way. This album is truly a blessing to me and my family. Just like to say to minister barnes and his family to be encourage and always abide in the lord. Please come out with a album that will touch my heart as this one did.
4,Still Rockin',"After many years & countless tour dates Nazareth records a ""LIVE""one back home. With energy & enthusiasm of early Naz, they play their brand of good rockin' tunes just like the old days! Great set list including all the standards, some ballads and some new stuff. Throughout the CD Dan McCafferty's razor sharp vocals are something Axl Rose (G'n'R) will always strive to match. For a Naz fan this is a five star effort and for those less familiar aneasy 4+. Let the party begin! Cheers!"
2,Marketing goof-up from Mattel,"Note the age guideline -- 14 years and up. The kids who want this doll are the same kids who watch the movie; I estimate that's 8-years and below. The doll is meant to be looked at, not played with. Why make a ""collector"" doll out of the character? I don't think she's THAT pretty. Goodness knows my little Barbie-loving neighbor girl is going to be disappointed."
2,ok,"This seemed like a neat toy for the bath or pool, however, we have a hard time blowing up the balloon through the tube. We end up having to take the balloon off, blow it up, and then reattach it to the boat. This makes it almost impossible for my 4 year old to play with it by herself."
2,Sounds Better Than It Is,"This toy sounds like it'd be wonderful. However, it is almost impossible for a child to blow up the balloon. This makes it a ""not-very-fun"" bath toy, when my son can't even blow it up himself. And, he's at the age where he can sit in the bathtub by himself and doesn't need me with him. Perhaps it would be a better bath toy if he were real little and I was there to blow it up for him all the time, or if he was older (10+) than this would be a fun toy in a pool. Also, the back wooden peg and the top smaller peg came off with very little use. I know we can probably glue them on again, but still I expected more from this toy."
5,"Highly Educational, Lots of Fun, Highly Recommended!","This is a great product. Kristal Educational does a fantastic job in teaching archaeology, palentology, astronomy, or geology through a toy.This toy also teaches patience and perseverance. Sure, there is a mess issue, but it can be easily contained by simply using newsaper, a little attentiveness, and a ""project area"".Note: This is a ""project"" toy. It does take some time to complete. I would not recommend it to any child that has a low attention level.My daughter received the Wooly Mammoth Dig Kit as a gift and she enjoyed it immensely. She still proudly displays it today."
1,weak for protection,"Woods model 21061 power strip, similar look to this model, survived from an underground wire being cut. However, it did not hold up to standards because the TV hooked up to it was still completely fried."
3,"Educational, clock face is sorta cheap","I like this clock, have been working on it with my 5 year old, he likes it however the face of the clock is a cheap ...sorta cardboard type that I know if my 2 year old got a hold of it, the clock would be trashed.If you have a child who is good with toys, it's great, if you have a destructable child, I would pass."
4,Your Basic Teaching Clock,"This clock is your basic teaching clock. I like it a lot because it is so simple. The cardboard on the face is not coated, and could be damaged easily if not taken care of, but other than that, it is very durable. If you push one foot, the clock moves forward a half hour, when you push the other, then the owl's eyes open, displaying the time shown on the eyes in analog style. It works well, and for the price, is a good bargain."
4,Does the job,"It helped make sense out of those pesky analog clocks. It also helped with counting by 5's.Clock is all sturdy plastic. The clock face is coated cardboard that lies on top of the solid plastic case. You can't poke through it because of the solid plastic case, but if you got it wet or had a dedicated destructo boy pry it off . . . it would be bad. We have had no problems in the three years we've owned it."
4,"Great machine, annoying software","1. You need and internet connection to activate the software that comes with the printer, and you need the software to be able to use the robotic functions of the printer.2. The printer reports it's low on ink about 100 discs before it actually runs out of ink, forcing you to either change the cartridge or click through a dialog box for each disk, so you can't leave a batch unattended.-- Other than those annoyances, it's a great machine for the price. I've made a few thousand DVD's with printed covers and the machine has performed well."
2,Significant problems,"This is a pretty decent CD/DVD burner for onesies and twosies. I have issues with it however. My biggest complaint is that when I am duping a large order the machine will--for no apparent reason and with no error messages--eject a disc from the duping tray and place it into the printing tray. Then the whole process freezes and I have to force quit, relaunch, insert the master disk and have it cache the entire file again. It happens enough to be a major headache so if you are on tight deadlines you may want to consider a different product."
1,"Software Errors,Drive Problems,Ink Indication",This is useless Product.There are Countless Errors in Software.DVD drive fail with in 5000 to 10000 Disks.i Bough New one with in 3 days It wont Print After Creating image.Ink Indication is WRONG YOU CAN PRINT UP TO 100 DISKS when it shows 0%Stay Away from THIS ProductIf you try to contact Customer Support it takes anywwhere from 30 to 45 minutes
5,A Great Experience with Music,"I love The Calling, and when I saw this I thought it would be a great gift for my wife who lives music. I was surprised by the personal insights of the band members and the music sounded great in the historic and special locations throughout Italy.I loved this setup so much I've also purchased other Music in High Places products with other artists that I like. It's like a music CD, videos, and artists interviews in one."
2,dissapointing,"I have the Goo Goo Dolls and Collective Soul for The High Places series and they are far better than this production. Sound and video quality were both very good but at times it just came off as phoney, canned in applause, staged MTV video. It just was not done nearly as well as the the earlier mentioned.Was hoping this would have been a classic for the collection but I wouldnt be surprised if i dont watch it again"
4,It is Sean less...,"It would have gotten 5 stars, but they cut Sean off the cover. I honestly bought this DVD for Sean Woolstenhulme the curly haired guitarist who left the band soon after this was made. The guitar playing is amazing, and the locations are beautiful. The clips of the band just hanging out are also funny, esp. the scooter incident!"
2,They shouldn't perform live,"I love The Calling. I play their CD all the time. I was really looking forward to this DVD but I was more than a bit let down. I think Alex Band has a beautiful voice but when he performs live he sounds so weak and amateurish. He totally misses half the notes in each song and completely avoids any difficult notes. He really needs a vocal coach. You can see on his face that he knows he sounds bad. Also, he's a bit stiff when he performs. He puts his hands in his pockets because he doesn't know what else to do with them and 99% of the time he just stands in one place. He's no Elvis. I do LOVE their music but this band is best heard on a CD and not in concert."
1,I have bought 4 - 5 pairs of CLIC,"and this one was terrible - I love the product and I have had others break after the warranty. I sent back this one and they did not cover it. They offered me a 25% discount on the next pair which brought it down to Amazon prices. The back adjusment broke and they could or would not repair it. I would buy CLIC in a second, but not with the extention in the back XXL"
4,Love the geeky glasses,"These are my new favorite reading glasses. I have a large head, think pumpkin. So I purchased the wide pair. These fit great. I took them on vacation to Hawaii with my 18 and 20 year old sons. They died every time I pulled them apart and put them on from the geek factor. That alone made taking the glasses along priceless."
4,Man-Size!,"I really like these glasses...they are easy to find since they hang around your neck and they look good doing it! With that said...here are the Cons...Since I'm 6'3"" 260 LBs...I would venture to say my head and temple are maybe slightly larger than the average size ...but not by much! So MEN...if you're wondering what size to purchase - I HIGHLY recommend you get these XXL! They are adjustable and MUCH more comfortable. Note* - I bought and tried the regular size...and they did indeed fit my face...but snugly; so, I had to ship them back for a refund and order the XXL...I did this using the immediate refund feature in Amazon which is excellent.My advice - do not get RED...I thought it would be easier to find them...but they are REALLY UGLY! LOL! So don't! Just get the BLACK XXL!Lastly...although I love the glasses...I really dont feel they are worth $32.00...I think $20.00 is a fair price."
2,"The song is beautiful, but not the quality of MP3",I was so excited when I found that I could download the Mp3 for The Prayer Instrumental... but the Mp3 is crackly and it skips at times. I was really dissappointed and wasted .99 cents!
4,Great Purchase,"Well, I haven't really put this bag through it's paces yet, but so far, it's held up really well. The laptop fits snugly, and very securely, and there are multiple pockets for anything you need space for. The flap over the back gets in the way from time to time, but I guess that makes it waterproof. There's a pouch on the shoulder strap to tuck a cellphone into for easy access, and the bag fits comfortably on my shoulders. It's well padded, and the mesh pockets on the back make it easy to remember where you stored important items. The handle on top makes it easy to just carry across the room, or for any other reason you don't want to cart it on your back for a length of time. For the most part, I use my bag for (D&D)gaming supplies"
5,Great Product,"Have one and love it.Best feature is the velcro bellows bag. Holds a full bag of cable nail straps (for romex) and opens wide for easy access. The velcro seals tightly with no leakage, even when the ladder is folded up and tossed in the truck. I usually demonstrate this feature by climbing down, slapping the pocket closed, folding up the ladder, and then turning the whole thing upside down and shaking. No spillage.The second best feature is the drill holster. Holds securely even without the strap fastened. Easy in/out even with long bits or drivers.Having hammer loops on both sides is very handy. I don't lay tools on the top of the ladder because I usually forget and don't like getting thumped in the head when I move the ladder. The hammer loops are stiff so they don't collapse and trap the hammer handle.These features turn the step ladder into a mobile workbench."
5,HIGH CLASS PERFORMANCE,"SINGERS, CHORUS AND ORCHESTRA OUTSTANDING, INTENSE, BRILLIANT,HIGH CALIBRE. DEEP AND PROFOUND. IF YOU LIKE WAGNER'S MUSIC YOU ARE GOING TO APPRECIATE THIS CD."
5,funny! smells great!,bought for a friends new car. I needed something to celebrate his new car that fit his personality and wasnt girly and this was perfect!!!!! smelled great good vanilla scent.
4,Are You Looking for High Energy?,"If so, this new band is exactly what you need. Great words and music that will have you playing the CD over and over. Well worth the price! I want to see them live..."
4,"Stylish, but hard to read","I love the looks of this watch, and I think the tide and moon functions are cool, but I find it very difficult to see the hands -- especially the minute hand. The hands are very thin and blend in with the watch face. Instead of glancing at the watch I have to study it -- and even tilt it at different angles to make sure I don't mistake the second hand for the minute hand (again)."
5,Enthusiastic variety,"This DVD is loaded with talent: Some very reverent, some very funny, and a lot of variety. I think it is better than Let Freedom Ring. I like them both, but the humor on this one is better; there is a fantastic harmonica solo by Buddy Green (I think I got that right), David's ""The End of the Beginning,"" is outstanding. The quartet is outstanding. Linda Randal sings a lovely song with Andrea Crouch at the piano. It is post 911, and was done at the same time as Let Freedom Ring. Both these DVDs help remind us of what it means to live in this country. Mickey"
5,Wonderful Gospel Music,"No one performs like the Gaither Family, heart and soul in every song. When I watched this one I had tears rolling down my face. If this dosen,t touch your heart than nothing will.When they sing God Bless America I was so proud to be an american. What a great song and they sing it with all they have. I always feel so much better after watching the Gaithers,they bring me such joy. I will buy them all....Money well spent.."
5,A great book!,"I have read this book to several classes of second graders, and have also given it as gifts to the same age range. The kids absolutely love it! It is a very innocent, clean-cut book, with a happy ending. What the kids enjoy most are the chapters written from the perspective of Lucky, the dog. I have also had older students with reading disabilities who were reading below their grade level, read it and love it, without feeling insulted. A great book for kids who claim they don't like to read."
3,Was hoping for more...,"Many interesting points in this book, but it was all very disorganized, and all too often the most interesting moments were curtailed with a short ""there's not enough space here to cover that."" The language of the book is overbearingly pedantic to no great effect, obscuring rather than clarifying the arguments. On the other hand, the subject matter is fascinating, and if you sift through a lot of nonsense, you can get a great overview of how the concept of disease generally -- and one in particular -- works it way through history and culture."
3,"Not the best, but still enjoyable","I greatly enjoyed the BBC presentation of Lord of the Rings, so figured I'd buy this one as well. Sadly, it is not nearly as good. The sound effects are painful to listen to at times, pronounciation is hard to follow and often incorrect, and the voice of the characters can sometimes be hard to follow. Gandalf for instance does not at all sound like I would expect him to! The way Bilbo interjects comments during parts of the narration seems a bit odd as well, but I did think the actor did a nice job with him at least. I think someone not familiar with the book would have a very hard time following the story, but for Tolkien fans, it's harmless fun at least."
2,Not anything to jump at...,"I recommend the Mind's Eye dramatization of this. At least Mind's Eye gets the pronunciation of names correct. GahLOOM for Gollum? All it takes is listening to Tolkien himself reading ""Riddles in the Dark"" (I recommend the Tolkien Audio Collection) to know that these producers didn't do their homework. Also, the split narrative is a bit distracting, and Bilbo's constant hemming and hawing makes him sound like he has a mental condition. The voice casting leaves MUCH to be desired as well. Gandalf (or GawnDAWLF as they mispronounce it) sounds awful! This actor would be interesting as Wormtongue in LOTR, but as Gandalf - PTOOIE! The script is not badly written, although they emphasize some WEIRD things in the plot, like an overlong description of Elrond."
5,An Essential Classic Reference Work,"This is a magnificent book carefully crafted by two of the leading theorists of the twentieth century. If you have a basic grounding in mechanics, vector analysis and tensor analysis then much of this book will be accessible. The early parts of the book are concerned with Special Relativity and the classical electromagnetic field using the action principle and tensor form of Maxwell's Equations. Later in the book there is in depth presentation of the General Theory of Relativity. This is very much a reference book rather than one to approach these subjects for the first time. There are no exercises or problems but it is a truly masterly work and well worth the money spent upon it and time invested studying it."
4,A cult classic.,"Seriously, a cult classic. And one should beware of cults. It's a very elegant, pristine presentation. However, this is often at the expense of sweeping some messier issues under the rug. Landau's reasoning has a very fluid intuitive quality, and it is easy to float along with as long as you don't stop an notice that sometimes it doesn't really make sense. I once heard a prominent physicist say of Landau's papers ""everything's wrong except the answers"". An exaggeration but some truth to it."
4,"A very dense little text, with lots of good content.","This was the course text for the University of Toronto undergrad 'relativistic electrodynamics'. A surprisingly small subset of the first half of this text was covered in that very thorough course. It would take a significant amount of study to work through this little text in full detail.This book tackles classical electrodynamics in an systematic and thorough fashion (albeit short on a number of details). I'd eventually hope to have the time to work through that part of the text in complete detail. Those parts of the text that I did read were very well written. One of the side effects of the terseness of the text, is that it provides a concise and light reference book, something that I expect to return to a number of times in future studies.The last half of the book is on GR, for which I have no comment at the moment."
5,I love this book,"It's so simple to read and just to the point. I honestly had to use the Jackson book, which was not that great, but made a great grade because of the Landau-Lifshitz classic. Then there was the advanced MIT EM book which made so much more sense, but it was all math. Those 3 books alone will give you a pretty adequate understanding of EM, enough to make over 95 out of 100 on every assignment. The Landau, MIT book together are well pretty cool themselves."
2,Overrated for Learning,"L&L, while elegant, is umotivated in the justifications that start their derivations. If the subject matter is grasped, then L&L is excellent for its directness. In brief, the volume is far from a learning tool."
2,Very disappointing...,"As a stay-at-home mother of a 3 and 5 year-old, I was repulsed by many of the passages of this book. In the beginning of the book, the author/mother states that by staying home she is giving up on the luxuries that accompany a 2nd income. Yet, many times she relates how she receives packages weekly from her on-line shopping forays, as well as the many outfits she buys in order to find one to match her image and life-style, as well as her $250 (organic food) grocery bill. Seems like she didn't give up many luxuries...that is such a turn-off to those of us who actually did! I thought this book was a depressing comment on the materialistic nature of so many people today. I always read books through to the end, but this one I couldn't even finish!!"
4,A Choir of Ill Children,"This book was wonderfully written. Great cover art. Unusual charectors. But, in the end I felt slightly cheated. The storm was over but I didn't feel the lead had changed much. He found out many things about his past yet it didn't effect his future. The book is still amazing and worth rereading."
2,Far from his best effort,"I only recently discovered the work of Tom Piccirilli and have been fairly impressed with his writing over all (the Fever Kill--Piccirilli's first full blown crime nowel--is particularly good.)and I was fairly excited about reading A Choir of Ill Children. The only problem is that the book is far too meandering for it's own good. Piccirilli concentrates on creating a creepy, other worldly atmosphere and does so in spades, but he sacrifices plot in order to demonstrate his obvious poetic gifts. If you're a fan of William S. Burroughs and other such surrealist writing, you'll love A Choir of Ill Children. However, if you''re looking for a straight forward Horror novel, you would do better to look elsewhere in Piccirilli's catalog."
1,Did someone pay these reviewers?,"Based on reviews, I decided to give A Choir of Ill Children a try despite its low price on Kindle. Well, I cannot fault anyone as it was my mistake for spending even $2.99 on this book. I honestly think the positive reviews must have been bought. I am a voracious reader and adore horror but well written, coherent horror. I haven't read this author's other work and doubt that I will, despite the award winning novel...cough. Choir is written in a very disjointed style that, at least I think, attempts to be clever and flowing, and ends up just being a huge mess with no structure at all. The tone is, I think supposed to be current but is laughable. The premise is stupid, the characters are loathsome, the setting is so contrived and sterotyped it is not funny or imaginative. This is probably the worst novel I've read and I've read some stinkers. Too bad I can't give away this book as it is a downloaded title, but at least I can delete it, FLUSH!"
3,Not his best,I really did not like this story much. Tom has written much better. You might like it; well-written. Just not my style.
1,Couldn't Get Through It,"I really hate to write this but Choir of Ill Children is just plain poor. Reading it was impossible as my mind kept wandering because the narrative was so dull. I know many have written of what an atmospheric novel this is, but sludge, fog, and landfills also have atmosphere. But I don't want to invest too much time with them. I felt that Piccirilli's November Mourns did a much better job of pulling off the Southern Gothic thing. This book just seems to be an exercise in surrealism with no real purpose. Don't let this novel put you off from trying Piccirilli's work. Just choose another title."
3,Strange. Very strange. But addictive.,"Talk about your plots that don't make sense! This one made so little sense that I had to read it a second time and it STILL didn't make sense.The very fact, though, that I read it twice shows you what good writing it is -- I never allow myself the luxury of reading something twice in the same QUARTER CENTURY, never mind the same WEEK. He's very lyrical and he sets the mood like you wouldn't believe. Now if I could just figure out what was going on...Strange. Very strange. But addictive."
3,Too many travel too short a stroy,The author tried to put too many travels in the book and did not provide enough of a story for the travels. This book should have had half as many travels and stayed the same number of pages. It will make you look for complete books on some of the travels.
5,Groovy Girl Hangout -- for more than just Groovies!,"We have had our Groovy Girl hangout for a while now and love it! It has been my daughter's constant ""soft doll"" house -- which she uses for her Groovies, Barbies, Only Hearts Club and other dolls of that size.The colors are bright and funky, and with the bed, chairs, dining area and desk, it gives so many options for play. It has lasted a good while (2+ yrs), which speaks to Manhattan's quality, and only the chair with the stem base has been broken (my son tried to rest his fist in it...it's just a cardboard base -- doesn't work so good for punching...). It comes highly recommended. With the amount of accessories that come with it, it's good for countless hours of play -- it certainly has in our house!"
4,Great Coffee Table Book,"This tribute to a bygone era was published half a century ago and holds up very well even if the printing is starting to fade. Interesting narrative enhances photographs of an America, chiefly midwest, that was emerging into the modern era. For example, Middleton describes how Interurban and Trolley Companies would build amusement parks on ther routes so that the public would have a reason to ride their cars on weekends and holidays. If you have the time it will transport you back."
2,connection problems,Constantly loses connection to my iMac and is very slow and difficult to regain connection. It gets 2 stars only because I like the action of the keys while typing and it has a built in keypad.
1,Should not have to pair it every time I log in computer,Just not a good product worked great for a couple of days then on the 3rd day every time the iMac came on we would have to go to bluetooth settings and manually fix it. I would not recommend this product. Stick with an apple key board. Plus I email the company who made it with NO RESPONSE. Crappy product with even worse customer service
2,Not working out,"I'm rather picky about my keyboards, I speed a lot of time on the computer and my first interface is the keyboard, so I want something the feels good and tells me that it worked. The keys seemed a little rough, hard to push, stiff. I liked that it's got the numeric keypad and that's important in my numeric entries, but the overall feel of the keys is just adding too much fatigue to my daily typing and I've had to retire the keyboard because of it."
1,I loved this keyboard until . . .,"I loved this keyboard. It was exactly what I wanted. I liked the feel of the keys, and especially the number pad. And then, almost a year to the day that I bought it, it died. Like another reviewer, I thought it was the batteries, so I changed them out a couple of times, but nothing. Since the warranty has expired I have no recourse but to warn other buyers to beware. I can't afford to buy a new keyboard every year, so it's back to my old Mac wired keyboard for me."
4,Good product for a Mac,"This works well with a Mac computer. Like most wireless, in this case Bluetooth items they go to sleep when not used as sometimes there is a short delay when starting them up again. Usually, I push on one key and wait for it to start and then carry on typying. Sometimes I need to push a key more than once, but it always works. If these devices didn't do that I would give a 5 star rating."
5,"Excellent, full-sized keyboard","Has everything I was hoping for. The only reason I consider it less than perfect (and this is probably my issue, not theirs) is a layout for the functions associated with the F keys that's taking me some time to get used to (although the icons on the keys themselves is definitely a plus)."
1,Mcally BTKey Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard for Mac,The item would be great if it worked. Two months after purchase it refused to pair with my computer and is making a funny noise. It is covered by a 1 year warranty but I don't know who to contact as there were no phone numbers given.
2,Poor BT connectivity,"The keyboard is nice and has a good layout and feel. I have problems with the bluetooth connectivity every time I turn the Mac on - it is almost as if it is fighting the mouse for the connection because ever since I connected this keyboard my mouse has started dropping the BT connection, although not as frequently as the keyboard does. I was surprised to see someone note the sticky key situation as I encountered a lot of that and thought it was just me not adjusting to the sensitivity of the keyboard. Would love to keep it plugged in but it is too frustrating to fight the connectivity."
1,Almost Unusable,"I love the look and functionality, however, it stickss keys on about every tenth word. I have to go bacck and edit sso much it takes me twice as long to write anything. Given the mostly possitive reviews I found while sshopping for it, I'm hoping I just got a bad unit (andd yes, I checked my repeat keyboard setting). As it stands, I can't really usse it. I'd love it if it only worked!"
1,Constant problems with keyboard,"Bought this keyboard because my wife needed a numerical pad and I wanted wireless. Keyboard for no reason, frequently becomes undiscoverable. Their website is useless. Currently have fresh batteries, cannot sync it - AGAIN. If had to do over, would never have bought this keyboard."
1,Not just disappointing - very bad performance,"Two months after purchasing the Macally Btkey keyboard, it stopped working. I've gone through a lot of batteries, so I figured it just needed another set. New batteries, existing batteries - nothing worked. While it did work there were occasional pairing issues and it's frustrating that the on/off switch is on the back - why not put it on the front?Although online manuals are offered by the company, this model is not included. The website says that battery life is up to two months, mine was a fraction of that.I'm sure there are better keyboards out there and it looks like I have to start shopping for one."
5,Macally rocks,"This keyboard is excellent. I saved a lot by going with Macally instead of Apple. I usually stick to the Apple brand for high quality, but in this instance the aftermarket product exceeded my expectations."
5,Great Keyboard,"Solid construction, solid Bluetooth connectivity, easy to type on, more than adequate set of keys, quiet and smooth operation, works perfectly with my MAC Mini. I am glad I bought this model not only because I saved money over an Apple unit but mainly because it is such a great keyboard. As usual Amazon provided their customary great pricing and service in my purchase of this product."
2,Good keyboard but not necessary,"The macally Bluetooth keyboard is a fine device, but not all that. The pairing is spotty, I often have to have the device I am trying to connect to forget the keyboard and then reinstall. As I type this the device is trying to connect to my iPad while I type easily on my touch keyboard. Sav your money, buy a nice case and skip the external keyboard."
2,"Nice, But DIED In Under a Year!","Very pleased with the look and functionality of this keyboard. UNFORTUNATELY it has died after about 10 months of use. Called tech support and they pronounced it dead. They are happy to replace it, but of course I have to go through the whole process of copying my proof-of-purchase docs, packaging it up and sending it back to them... :("
4,Comfortable feel for a long time user,"Macally has always made quality products and this is one of them. It has a comfortable feel, tactile feedback and connects easily. It is also a full keyboard unlike the mini-keyboard Apple is trying to force on us.Connecting via Bluetooth is easy and it stays connected. A lot of the Bluetooth devices I've connected to my Mac want to drop off and on at random. I have no idea why but this one stays connected.My only con is the sleep feature. I wish they would have included an option to turn it off. It is annoying to have to wake it up simply because I read a web page. That's the reason for one star down,"
3,"Not Bad, But.....","My old-school Macally keyboard of 7 years finally died, and replacing it was a real hassle. It was the old basic extended keyboard that had been sold for years, full size, with real keys and connected via usb cable. Basic but well made and easy to type on. I tried apple's keyboard but didn't like the chiclet-like keys (shades of TRS 80) and looked in vain to find a Mac compatible keyboard that was reliable and inexpensive. I ended up buying this one mostly on price and having the (dubious) bonus of bluetooth. Overall it's ok. I like some of the flexiblity bluetooth offers, and the keyboard, once I got used to it is fine. Two knocks-it only comes in white (and as such does not match my black MacBook and stands out on my desk like a sore thumb) and I have to keep cleaning it otherwise fingerprints show up. But for less than 40 dollars it was a fine deal for what I need now."
1,wireless keyboard,"This keyboard has some serious problems, l lot of the keys are mislabeled, for an example the @ key is ( . there were at least 6 other keys the same way. Needless to say I set it back"
2,Expected more,"I had high expectations, but was disappointed. The keyboard had a problem that caused many keystrokes to appear twice. This was so deleterious to typing productivity that I had to return the keyboard.The tactile feel was about what you'd get from a nice laptop keyboard, the layout was nice, and the bluetooth seemed to be OK, but the keystroke doubling problem was a real killer for me. Too bad."
3,"Great keyboard, frustrating connectivity, finally died after a year","I love the look of the keyboard, the contoured keys and touch, the locations of the eject and volume buttons, the solid feel, the rise and its ability to keep pretty clean - only one button's letter has slightly faded. BUT, every time I changed batteries, I would have a heck of time reconnecting. And half of the time waking from sleep I would have to press a bunch of keys for however long to get it to start working. Finally, after a year, after replacing the batteries (I tried with two sets so it's not a battery issue) it would not pair even when pressing the button on the back, nor would the pairing light even blink to indicate it was trying. So off to Fry's I went to get a wired Mac keyboard. No more connection issues! But I'll miss the great features I mentioned above, especially the keys."
2,Pick another one,The problem with this keyboard is that you go to use it and it's not pairing up. Each and every time you have to wait for it to sync...gets old quick. You cannot just start typing. It has to pair up and it takes forever. Not good.
1,Macally BTKEY degraded quickly,"Initially the keyboard paired efficiently with MacBookPro, Windows7, and iPhone4. But after one month of light use, the keyboard died. No matter how many know-good batteries were tried, the keyboard remained dead. MacAlly's manufacturing source for the keyboard must have exercised poor quality control. They should replace the dead keyboard."
3,Good but not great,"Better than Apple standard keyboard. However, just a standard scissor switch keyboard with limited feed back. Doesn't really match the white of the apple mouse and hence doesn't really look like a set."
3,Solid alternative to more expensive products,"This is a good product considering the expense of others on the market. The keyboard is fairly slim for full-sized. The only complaint that I have about it at this point is that when the keyboard sleeps it takes a LONNNNG time to wake up, I'm talking like more than a minute. It's probably worth that occasional hassle considering the savings, though."
3,Annoyingly slow Bluetooth pairing,"I only have one complaint about my Macally Bluetooth keyboard (which I am typing this on right now): When it goes to sleep, it is excruciatingly slow to wake up and pair with my iMac. I try typing, and the pairing light will blink, and blink, and blink... sometimes it takes a full 3 minutes for it to finally connect with my iMac! This is unacceptably slow."
2,Not Good At All,"Plus: good aesthetics, easy to type with nicely spaced keysMinus: bluetooth goes on and off, will go weird on you and start repeating keys endlessly *suspect bad bluetooth connection with the keyboard"", no battery indicator %Stick to the originals, this is way too much hassle especially if goes weird on you in the middle of work."
4,Alternative to the Apple Wireless Keyboard,"Ok, so I purchased this keyboard because I can't stand the new Apple keyboards and was looking for an alternative that didn't have all the extra junk that most aftermarket keyboards have. First off, let me say this is still not as good as the older Apple wireless keyboards with the number pad on the side. However, the key feel is pretty good, and a vast improvement over the current crop of Apple keyboards. If you like the feel of a traditional full sized keyboard with old-fashioned chunky keys, this one is pretty daarned close. If you're prone to fat-fingering keys on the new Apple keyboards, this one will help. All in all, a good alternative to the Apple products."
2,"Nice keyboard, lousy bluetooth!","I love the feel of the keyboard, but I was having problems with my mouse losing its bluetooth connection many times per day, and great difficulty connecting this keyboard in the morning. After hours on the phone to Apple, we found that the BTKey was causing the problems. I emailed Macally, and they tell me the 32-bit driver is not compatible with Lion. Great! They said they may update it someday, but will not give me an answer as to when. So, I have this lovely keyboard I cannot use...."
2,Unstable,"Like the feel of the keys, but it's terrible at connecting to my Macbook Pro. I have a bluetooth Apple Magic Mouse next to it that usually does just fine connecting, so nothing is wrong with my MBP. If I try to wake up my MBP when it's been asleep (and in clamshell mode), the keyboard will almost NEVER be recognized. That includes whether the keyboard has already been turned on, or if it's been turned off. In order to get it to be recognized, I usually have to turn the keyboard off and back on 5-15 times (and it's more likely to work if my magic mouse is turned off). Otherwise, it just keeps blinking ""pairing"". Terrible device.Plus there's a blank key that macally tech support confirmed does nothing. Who designed this? I'm going with the expensive apple bluetooth keyboard and a USB numeric keypad."
5,learning and teaching,"Watch and watch again, then start doing it. It did teach me few minor things that do make the difference. I had had some lifting problems that watching this dvd corrected ."
3,Fast delivery and product was as expected,I like he DVD. The only complain I have is the way it teaches you how to perform the jumping position. Everett be leaves that it can not be thought and the best way is just tell the person to jump when the bar is in jumping position. I keep bending my elbow when I just tried to jump. I purchased two DVDs from World Class Coaching and they break it down. I was able to clean up my clean greatly.
2,awkward fence,"For the money it's an OK machine and the router bit adapters are handy, but the fence doesn't move far enough back to change bits. At least one, sometimes both, T bolts must be removed to get the fence out of the way for bit changes."
2,Poor Adjustment Controls,"The machine works fairly well, but set-up adjustments and controls are not well thought out. I would like to get rid of mine and try another brand."
1,I expected something better,I’ got this battery installed in a remote control. I press two keys on the remote every day and the battery last 10 days. I can say they are non functional after 20 key strokes.I expected something better
1,No good,It arrived nearly out of juice. I should have guessed from the super-low price. I recommend against buying from this source.
5,battery,I just looked at my old battery and I new this was the right one it word out gr8 now I don't have to git a new one for 5 years thanks
5,Great battery,"This battery is just great. I ordered one for my HP laptop's remote controller. I would rate this battery A+++++, would buy it again. Although it has not shipped yet, so I am not sure on the quality, I can guarantee this is the battery you need for your HP Pavilion entertainment PC dv6915nr with Altec Lansing speakers. I know , because I did the hard ground-level research, opening the controller, finding the battery, removing the battery, examining the battery, finding the name of the battery, replacing the battery, closing the battery containment area, and so on."
5,Batteries that work,"I tried to get a battery at Walmart, my HRM still died. So, I guess the fact that this battery works is an accomplishment."
3,I was not as impressed with this book.,"Not as good as the Misremebered Man, I think I was expecting this book to be as good, but unfortunately for me it was not."
2,Such a let down.,"Daft Punk's Human After All depresses me. Where did all the funky beats go? When did the electronic disco die? HAL is repetative, draggy, and annoying. Robot Rock is simply ""Robot Rock"" repeated many times (although, I have to say the track is one of the better on the CD) - Television Rules the Nation is an example of one slow dragging synth line going on far too long. The dance has died. =("
1,Incredibly Dissapointing,"This disc is an incredible disappointment- Human after all is a significant, saddening departure from Daft Punk's previous work. This disc is entirely devoid of emotion, in stark contrast to discovery, whose tracks easily elicit their intended emotional responses. I couldn't stop playing Discovery, and I can hardly stomach listening to ""Human after all"" after just hearing it for the first time. I hope Daft Punk can recover from their hiatus and get themselves back on track, cause their fans (at least this one) are anxiously waiting. If you've never experienced Daft Punk, please avoid this disc, they're far more talented than this disc would lead you to believe."
1,Very Disappointing,"From the first eponymous track the album has a common theme on most of the songs: they introduce interesting sounds and fail to do anything with them, so halfway through every track has fallen flat on its face. Even my favorite track (Make Love) feels like trying to grasp air, it just goes on without any development and it makes me sad because it had a good foundation. What makes the album truly disappointing though is a lack of life in the music: everything here was half done so you never can connect with any of it."
2,Daft Punk - Human After All,"Say what you will about Daft Punk, but they were never really boring... not even with HUMAN AFTER ALL. Sure, the title track could have come off DISCOVERY, but ""The Prime Time of Your Life"" sounds like a skit choreographed by Gary Glitter then put through the spin cycle of a washing machine. ""Robot Rock"" is glam-heavy, while ""Steam Machine"" is heavy with hiss, but both go on too long. The musical ideas are there, but they don't go anywhere. Need proof? Listen to how ""Make Love"" is one loop, repeated for 4 1/2 minutes. The mantra of ""Technologic"" gives it a bit more texture, but ""Emotion"" just grinds along until it finally ends. Human after all? Not when you just hit the ""repeat"" button and walk away."
3,Not what I had expected,"Unlike Discovery before it Human After All isn't a song that you can listen through without skipping more than a song or two. While it isn't a cd filled with singles there are a few songs that shine through such as Human After All, Robot Rock and Technologic. However there are a few Daft sounds that are used a bit too much throughout the cd and some of the loops are indeed too long. I hoped for a bit more out of these guys. A solid effort for most but a bit below par for Daft Punk."
2,Not exactly what was expected from the French duo.,"In the beginning, Daft Punk began solely as a trance-y, dance-y, electronic kind of group, particularily with the release of ""Homework"", which I feel is a two-and-a-half star album. Now, ""Discovery"" is the best thing Thomas Bangalter and Guy Manuel De Homem-Christo released, filled with nostalgic, disco-style tunes that fit correctly in its great production. ""Human After All"" has more attention to guitars, which I feel are great but the songs are repetitive and not well produced. Why didn't they cut the songs short, like two-minutes long? No, instead they made it into five-minute long tunes that definitively test the listener's patience. Not a great album but one that could have been tidied up much, much better."
2,Disappointing After All,"WOW, I am really shocked! Hmmmm, I am downright mad that I not only bought this but am trying to find a reason to like it just because IT IS DAFT PUNK. Another reviewer said they are ""going back to their roots?"" What are you talking about!? There are no roots on this album! It's more of a new experimental electro album ,with Daft Punk feel, full of never ending loops and robot voices! I kept waiting for a song to change or kick into high gear, but no! Honestly, I would rather listen to just a kick drum and hi-hats all day than this!I shall calm for a second and tell you I did enjoy Track 9-""Technologic"" It seems to be the only track they put any thought into...and it's on the lyrical end of the spectrum.Seriously folks, if you want experimental Daft Punk, buy Thomas Bangalter's soundtrack for IRREVERSIBLE. If you want Daft Punk as we've come to love........STAY AWAY FROM THIS and rebuy any of the other albums!!! (WHIMPER, WHIMPER, WHIMPER!)"
2,It's not terrible...,"But it still is not worth buying. Human After All simply doesn't have the effect as dance music as Discovery and Homework have. 'Television Rules The Nation', 'Steam Machine', and 'On/Off' are probably the worst songs on the album, and the worst songs Daft Punk have ever done. 'Emotion' and 'Make Love' are just weak. 'Technologic' is like 'Teachers' and 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger' had a retarded child. 'Robot Rock' isn't bad until maybe 10 seconds after it starts; after which it's the exact same as those first 10 seconds. In a word, this album is repetitive. I wouldn't bother."
2,Repetitive After All,"After another four-year wait, Daft Punk officially return with a relative clunker that was recorded in just 6 weeks from what I understand. The real shame is that there are still some killer riffs to be found here but they are played out with the utmost minimalism lacking any variation or increasing complexity. Songs -- or should I say vignettes? -- that would have been satifying at a neat 3 minutes are dragged out to close to 5 minutes for almost no apparent reason other than to pad this sparse album's playtime. The title track ""Human After All"" is the clearly shining track on the album, setting the rest of the album up for disappointment. Other singles like ""Robot Rock"" feature great riffs but quickly wear out their welcome when the 4-minute mark is reached and there's hardly anything to show for it. Daft Punk have always been about a certain degree of minimalism and simplicity in their own cheerfully naive way, but this time they have exposed themselves as plainly insipid."
2,Bollocks!,"Just goes to show that once you're famous, you can come up with pretentious drivel like this, and it'll still sell by the truckloads! Try their earlier stuff instead or prepare to be bored! Die hard Daft fans will force themselves to like it, but deep down inside you know it sucks! Any bedroom musician coulda made this. Ofcourse it wouldn't have been released because it woulda been trashed for the crap that it is!"
1,Creative Block?,"This is in response to the review by the gentleman who uses the phrase ""slamming"" to sum up the album. Yes they do play repetitive loops but i think they must be going through a creative block as this album is not worthy to be mentioned along side homework."
2,Not worth buying,"This cd just isn't up to Daft Punks usual standerds. It seem like this is just all the songs that weren't good enough to go on their last album. While there are two good tracks(Technologic, which is almost exactly like Harder, Stronger, Faster, and Human After All, it's just not worth paying for."
3,Daft Punk at their most average.,"After their more radio friendly album Discovery this album is going to come as a shock to most people.It's back to the basic loops, repeatative over-long tracks, and minimalist dirty synths. If you liked their album Homework then you'll probably like this.However it certainy doesn't have the fun and variety that album did, and it is mostly without a highlight. The single, Robot Rock, is catchy but overlong, the title track Human After All is bouncy, but without energy.Hardcore fans will love this, people who have just heard Discovery will probably dislike it, and people who were kind of sitting on the fence will be left rather flat.It's a mixed bag, but its intended audience is probably the club dance floor anyway - and it will most likely be played there - so is it a success? As a CD, I'd say not, but as a slice of Daft Punk doing what they are famous for... sure.Overall? Their worst album, but not a complete loss."
1,(bad)tacular,"A totally disappointing effort by the band. The whole thing sounds like they weren't interested. The best track on here is 'Robot Rock' which is an undeveloped sample of a funny song by Breakwater. After releasing this undeveloped work after four years it wouldn't surprise me if both of them aren't interested in producing together, if at all, any more. Check out their excellent album Homework and forget this."
4,RAWK!!!! RO-BOT RAWK!!!!!,"Daft Punk did an awesome job on this CD, but my parents thought it was repetitive. My favorite songs on this CD are ""Human after all"",""Technologic"", and ""Robot Rock"". Anyway im thinking of getting their latest album ""Musique Vol.1 1993-2005."
2,No imagination...after all.,"C'mon guys! How can you call this an album? This is a hour long gorging of looped tracks and hooks...that, in the end, makes for a very ""stuck in your head"" experience.Nobody likes it when a song gets stuck in their head. Good songs don't get ""stuck"", good song ""linger"". This is just repetitive...after all.(Case in point, the song ""Human After All"" has one point where the word ""Human"" is repeated 125 times in a row....nothing else, just ""Human"".)"
1,HUMAN AFTER ALL - NOT WRONG!,10 TRACKS OF B SIDES...CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE IT...NOT A HELL OF ALOT OF IMAGINATION WENT INTO THIS ONE FROM THE BOYSSHANE WALKER..TASMANIA
5,"Now They see the Genius, Sheesh.","Daft Punk's concept album was panned when it was released, but now all the fools are realizing. Come on people, it is a genius album that was a direct commentary on our society and still is. Daft Punk changes it up every album, you can't be comparing it to past ones: apples vs oranges."
4,Different,"With each of their CD's change comes in some for or another. Now change can be looked at as being bad or being good. Here it is more good but a little for the worse as well.Nothing can compare to their debut: Homework. That was just a phenomenal breakthrough CD. Their second CD was still good (not as good as the the first) but with quite a bit of change. On this third effort......more change. Less vocals (whick I, personally, prefer a little more of a vocal) and the sounds seem to be quite similar going song to song. Yes, they make you want to get up and find a dance floor and bust a move but it does seem to get quite repetitive after a few listens.I do like it. But, I have to listen in small doses."
5,Love it - they have evolved once again !,"I am surprised that people are disappointed with this album. Yes, this is a departure from Discovery but so too was Discovery from Homework. The reason why DP is such a standout is because they take risks and not try to deliver the same album over and over. The beats are repetitive yet all their music is repetitive. They went with a much more simplistic style on this album - and most all the songs are so catchy I just can't get them out of my head. My favorites are -Television rules the nation , Technologic, The prime time of your life , and Human after all. I would say to listen to this album a couple of times before forming an opinion. I love it !"
2,What is this?,"I loved Discovery so much that I bought this album as soon as I saw it. I brought it home, put it on while I had some friends over, and before half the cd was done, we couldn't take it anymore. The sounds on this cd are harsh, and they are repeated over and over again. Listening to this entire cd straight through is torture.Try and listen to a sample or a single first, before you buy this album, because it's nothing like Discovery."
2,not very good.,"four years in the making, 9 tracks (""On/Off"" doesn't count) and... well, this is just not very good at all. what the hell happened? there are two tracks i enjoy: ""steam machine"" and ""technologic"" - and even that is an almost carbon copy of ""faster, stronger..."" from the last album. every track is nothing but a loop idea repeated for six minutes. ""robot rock"" practically made me puke. i'm so bummed out."
2,The death of Daft Punk?,"I remeber feeling slightly let down by Discovery, but still happy that there were at least a few great tracks on the CD. Our French friends have clearly changed for the worse with this one, plain and simple. Each track contains only a few different loops and the mixing doesn't sound like mixing at all it sounds like they just throw in a loop and then switch it off a few minutes later. Homework had so many creative fades and crazy loops that you can go through the entire album and have trouble telling where one song ends and the other begins. I was disappointed, let's hope they spend more than two months on their next album."
2,boooo,"This album is lame. I can't believe it comes from the same group who put out the best album of all time, 'Alive 2007.' Seriously, this album is lame. It's simplistic and monotonous. There is nothing that moves you. Daft Punk was really phoning it in this time."
1,Too bad!!!,"It's too bad that the french band gives us such an album. I've found ""discovery"" very good. But this one is nothing but some beats that goes round and round with no beginning and no end. An advice...don't buy it."
2,Human after all,"This album is ok. It is the worst daft punk album, but its still not bad. My favorite tracks are Human after all, robot rock, make love, the brainwasher and television rules the nation. I love daft punk the the rest of the tracks are bad."
3,Robots in the world,"With Human After All, Daft Punk reveals an irony, that its music is now devoid of emotions and personality. Make no mistake, Human After All is still a fine piece of electronic goodness but don't think of Discovery.Human After All is a little cold, perhaps decidedly so. Some tracks like Robot Rock and Steam Machine seem to be one long extended track. Daft Punk borrows a bit more than usual from rock music this time round than in previous cases. The fusion of rock and dance works at times but falters in parts too.However, all is not lost. There's still the very stellar Prime Time Of Your Time, Make Love, Brainwasher and Technologic. The closer, Emotion, does finally evict the coldness to bring some humanity to the album. Six weeks might have been a case of laziness covering for a 4-year hiatus but the masters at work still manage to scrape through, just barely."
3,What happened?,"After an album as clever and elegantly dancable as ""Discovery,"" Daft Punk dropped the ball on ""Human After All."" The tracks seem like really good musical ideas, but they're highly undeveloped.I could see a DJ in a club remixing the tracks to perfection, but it's pretty raw and boring save for ""The prime time of your life"" and ""Technologic.""I probably wouldn't buy it again, but I did buy it, and it's not horrible, but still not as good as ""Discovery."""
1,I liked it when they were robots.,"It took 6 weeks to make and it sounds like it. Very disappointing. I tried to get into it but daft punk just got lazy; however, they're not dead yet. Let's see if they can redeem themselves next album. I recommend the chems ""Push the Button"" or plump djs ""eargasm""."
3,It's Alright,"It's has nothing on Discovery, but it's a pretty cool little album in its own right. My personal favorites are ""Human After All,"" ""The Prime Time of Your Life,"" ""Make Love,"" ""Technologic,"" and ""Emotion."""
3,Pretty good.,"This is a solid album, perhaps not quite as good as Discovery and Homework. The title track has one of the most infectious guitar riffs I've ever heard, and burns itself into your brain even more than the vocals in ""Around the World."" Same goes for ""Robot Rock."" I will agree with the other reviewers who say that ""Steam Machine"" and ""Brainwasher"" are a bit weak, though."
2,Repetitive x2,"I had high hopes for this album after 2 previous great releases. And at first listen it does sound good. The hooks are VERY catchy. The problem is, that's all this album has got. Hooks looped over and over. Maybe it would make for good dancefloor music, but not anything else. I've tried to enjoy it in my car, but after the first 30 seconds I'm bored and want to skip to the next one..which cause the same thing to happen.It seems like Daft Punk thought they would be selling their songs to companies for 30 second commercials, similar to their brethren Air. Yes, Robot Rock would make a great Volkwagen commerical track. But real music it most certainly is not. Even today's youth with their short attention spans must surely get tired of this effort quickly. Let's hope the guys get their act together for the next album."
2,Awful and Disappointing,"Homework was amazing and everything has been down hill from there. Discovery was definitely worth buying and had some really great songs on it but this album is a complete and utter failure. The tracks seem boring, tired and uninspiring. Avoid this record."
4,Repetitive? Yes Catchy? Yes -- You Know You Love It.,"When Daft Punk released their first single, Da Funk, it was also repetitive and a great tune. This is their style and they haven't changed anything up. Either you like it or your hate it...but admit it, eventually there is that one or two songs you grow to love. TECHNOLOGIC is an awesome song."
2,Boring,"Seems like there's two sets of fans of Daft Punk. Ones who loved their Homework album, which was more club oriented floor fillers. And ones who loved their second album, which was a pop album. Human After All seems to fall right in between, not too underground and not pop enough. I am a fan of their Homework album and was hoping to hear some of that. I'm also a DJ who plays One More Time at almost every Barmitzvah I do. After barely able to listen through the whole album, I can honestly say ""Human After All"" will not get any play in any format. It's boring and emotionless. Can you say REMIX."
2,Only one?,"This is for ONE beer mug. It's nice, don't get me wrong, but not nearly as heavy as I would have expected for the price. I ordered four and they came in a box that said 4 pc set. But Amazon confirmed that each one is sold individually. huh.Update: The price was originally $70 for one."
4,great grip with enhanced ergonomics,"The stock grip always felt too large for my hands. This grip feels GREAT!HOWEVER..... to me, it usually feels 'slippery' altho there's nothing to 'wipe off'.I'd buy it again & recommend it to a friend with that caveat.Michael"
1,Different model,"I ordered the Hogue grip for a Colt Python and it does not fit !!!!The product description is not accurate as there are two different handle frames and this grip requires a base clip whereas my Python handle frame has a side screw...see the below link, wish I saw it before ordering as I live abroad....[...]"
1,horrible - don't do it,The diamonds were dirty and cloudy. The earrings looked terrible. There was also 1 diamond missing from the earrings. I guess you get what you pay for and there was no bargin here.
1,These earrings stink!,The earrings I got ARE NOT the same as presented in the picture. What I got is of a cheaper quality and they are not what I want at all. I would not recommend anyone to buy these earrings. A waste of good money.
2,Terribly disappointing.,Item arrived with a missing stone and one of the hoop hinges did not lock tightly. Terribly disappointing as the earrings were beautiful.
2,No sparkle. Looks like textured silver earrings,"I bought these at 50% off and was hopeful to get a beautiful pair of 2ct diamond hoops for going out to dinner,the ballet etc. I opened the box and was so diappointed. They have NO sparkle. They look like textured white gold or something because the diamonds are sooo small. How diappointing! They are going back."
5,EXTREMELY PLEASED,"My company purchased Crystal Reports and I knew absolutely nothing, except that I needed to know how to use this product. I purchased Hammerman's book and found it extemely easy to follow. Each page presented step by step documentation on how to attack my report writing needs. I went from knowing nothing about Crystal to being able to produce a couple reports by the end of the day. If I need to review something, I can just flip through the pages and find my answer right in front of me!!! You just can't beat that."
5,One of the best training manuals out there for Crystal,"I think after having seen this manual versus having seen what I got as a reference material in the shrink wrapped box from Crystal with the software, there is no comparison. If you need to train yourself or others to use Crystal, this is a great book to use. Plenty of screen shots in here and hands on excercises with sample data to play with.Thumbs up!"
4,Great price,"Great price but small through the arms and chest area for the size I bought. Got it for my husband, but will use it myself."
3,i could not used it.,the item I recieve was damage by the ups people. it was rip in the front an has oil or lotion on it. I did not get to used it.
5,Very nice helmet fits great.,I love this coat. It keeps the sun out of my eyes and it's everything I would ask for in a coat. It has one pocket. Overall I would rate this 11 out of 10.
1,clear raincoat purchase,i was most dissatisfied with this purchase and an additional purchase of 2nd raincoat when my son received the first order there was a hole in it and the facility had to return it at my sons expense and when they returned it they sent a clear yellow raincoat and was not accepted so the 2nd raincoat to a different inmate was also rejected and when i tried to get a credit for both raincoats i was told there would be no credit coming to me needless to say i will not order from them again was not a good business deal
3,Clear Rain Coat with Hood,The service was good. I received my rain coat in a timely manor. The coat either runs small or I run too large! The coat uses plastic snaps that don't fit properly which makes it difficult to keep it closed. I immediately notified the seller's customer service through their web-site but they did not respond.
4,clear raincoat,"i needed a clear raincoat as a volunteer at the 2010 world equestrian games. the raincoat was nice, quality was good, but i suggest to order a size up."
1,Joint Max TS Soft Chews,"I was very disappointed in this product. My dog's movement did not improve at all; however, I purchased the phy-cox chews and I have noticed a huge difference. In my opinion, the joint max chews are a waste of your money, but do try the phy coxPhyCox-JS Soft Chews (60 Soft Chews). They are amazing and completely worth the money. My lab was jumping around like a puppy within a few days of this purchase!!!"
2,Little dog would not eat these.,"Sorry, but the little dog turned up his nose at these ""Joint Max"" chews, so they would have been wasted, except that an acquaintance's large dog does eat them.For both Glucosamine AND Chondroitin in a treat, there are three chewable products to consider with good reviews.""Sea Jerky"", made from ALL NATURAL sources, beef flavor. (search: ASIN B0002TR5U2)""Glucosamine Chondroitin for Dogs"", bacon flavor, but all natural??? (search: ASIN B000CD8BRY)""Happy Hips"" ---Caution: Made in China---, in various flavors. (search: ASIN B00066CRZY)And the little dog will eat:""Joint Treats""; they're soft and ALL NATURAL, but they are NOT a complete supplement: although they contain Glucosamine, they do NOT contain Chondroitin; but they do provide Creatine & MSM. (search: ASIN B0009RSOVG)Finally, from experience I know that a pet's Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplement is an excellent way to relieve or prevent some forms of arthritis!"
4,Great product,"Cheaper than similar products at the vet's office, Joint Max chews are easy to administer and my sheltie who has inflamed arthritis is doing much better."
5,strong suplement for dogs,this is the best joint suplement in the market today for bones and skin. the dogs love it. entirely pets is one of the best companys in dogs suplies.
3,Pretty cool,"great bird book to get your kid if their into birds or wanna know more about them, some pretty neat info."
5,Great coffee Maker,"10-26-2012. We have used this model BUNN BXW Velocity Brew 10-Cup Home Coffee Brewer, White since 2002 and find it very good. We choose to stay with this model due to the great coffee and simplicity of operation. For example, the plastic water tray deteriorates at the connection to the hot water tank. Out last one is still working after seven years but we ordered a replacement as it is on its ""last legs"", so to speak. When the plastic disintegrates futher it will no longer hold water. For this one that will be soon. Still,the overall product is superior to all the Mr. Coffee and Sunbean units we used previously. We do disassemble the water tray and remove calcium scale about twice a year and that seems to extend the operation life."
1,Bunn Coffee maker,I didn't like the Bunn coffe maker. Coffee didn't taste good and the coffeemaker takes up a lot of space on the counter.
2,Not what I expected!,"When reading the sales pitch for this DVD, one would expect ""Magic."" However, all you get is two guys juggling the ball without any ""spunk."" The first routine shows a gentleman juggling the ball doing three different ways and he keeps doing the same thing for about 20 minutes. Nothing fancy, simply keeping the ball from touching the ground. The second guy has one nice trick in which he takes his shirt off and the put it back on while keeping the ball on the back of his neck. The rest, is just kids 'attempting' stuff. There is no instruction whatsoever. I recommed against it. Hope this helps."
4,It's what'cha want.,"This is obviously a collection most will buy for the videos. While the most casual fans will be happy with simply the biggest hits, the DVD will appeal to the fanatics. So, I guess there's something for everyone here. This reminds me of the recent Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Greatest Hits"" with DVD, meaning music and videos, but only the basics. Still, the songs are classic, and who does video better than the Beasties? Remember the ""Fight For Your Right To Party"" video, or how about the awesome ""Hey Ladies"" and ""Intergalactic""? Not to mention the 70's cop spoof ""Sabotage"". This might not be as great as the ""Sounds Of Science"" anthology song-wise, but with the added videos, it's ""Solid Gold""."
4,A wonderful surprise in Vienna!,"My wife and I had the opportunity to see Placido Domingo in Pique Dame at the Statsoper in Vienna summer 99'. What a fabulous performance. I can't speak for this recording, but the opera itself was magnificient. It made me re-evaluate my view on the Russian composer. I always saw him as a popular composer for the masses. This score establishes him in my mind as a composer of more depth. A solid, complete opera for fans of opera. All neophytes, check out a three tenors performance."
2,"The book was damaged, I returned it.","Sorry Amazon,Can't review it and couldn't return it in the proper way (the order disappeared from my history). i returend it myself because the book was damaged. Hope I get a refund."
3,hit and miss,"there are some really good songs on this album, but there are also some of the worst songs I've ever heard. This was almost bound to heppen because every song is completely different making some of the transitions on the album bizarre. They just couldn't all be great is what I'm trying to say.""Garbielle"", ""The rift"", ""Someday"", ""Monique the Freak"", ""I fell in Love today"", and ""Did you see me?"" are all really great somgs in that order, and none of them sound similar. ""did you you see me"" and ""I feel in love today"" are nice slow songs, while ""monique the freak"" sounds like Rick James. Though there all really good.On the opposite side, none of the other songs are all that great and some can be more annoying than anything else. ""Tastes good on the Buns and ""how high can you fly?"" are messed up.And Ween does continue with their oddball music. Like ""israel"" is a sermond with elevator muzak. weird.Though the album is kit or miss, some of the songs on it are really good."
4,Tastes Good on th' Bun,"Yeah, so Tastes Good on th' Bun has the lyrics:tastesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss good on the bun.over and over again.but what a great little tune. And then ""Big Fat F*ck"" (the asterisk isn't in the song title but Amazon won't accept this review without it, even though Amazon shows the title in the track listings without the asterisk, how lame is that?) which is a different great little tune that sounds like walking through mud and the refrain ""feelin' like a big fat f*ck.""And then you have the polar opposites like ""How High Can You Fly"" which out Pink Floyds Pink Floyd. And everything else inbetween. If you like Ween, you'll like this. If you don't like Ween, chances are you probably won't like this.I realize that last paragraph isn't saying much.They jump genres, deconstruct music, and represent it. Solidly. As usual."
3,Not the best but an ok resource,"This book is ok, but is largely based on the author's experiences. Also, some of his ""facts"" are incorrect (an Italian Greyhound can run 25 mph, not 40) and his methods are inconsistent. Its a good introduction to the breed but I would recomend the Lillian Barber book."
5,WOW! What a great movie!,This movie is set in 1947 around the time India was partitioned and Pakistan was created.Entralling story by renowned writer Amrita Pritam Singh with Manoj Bajpai and Urmilla displaying some of the best acting I have ever seen. Manoj Bajpai's acting was especially astounding.The sets look very authentic and the haunting cinematography is par excellence. Don't know why this movie was rated R because movies with similar or greater levels of violence have been rated PG-13. It maybe because of differences in US and Indian movie ratings scales.Hard to find a weak spot in this film. One area where it could be improved is the action sequences which were sometimes a bit amateurish.Overall a FANTASTIC movie.
3,Pinjar DVD,Arrival--very timelydisappointed that the DVD has few skips in it.I will try cleaning it & hopefully they are minor.
3,Conrad Schnitzler - 'Klavierhelm' (Important),"I'm assuming this a totally all-newly recorded effort by Schnitzler, no reissue. Decent piano playing, but keep in mind that these ten untitled tracks are a far cry from his work with Tangerine Dream and Kluster of many days gone by. Simply described as uptempo piano playing. I know he's got at least two other similar titles like this one. Enjoy."
3,"Good Rockin' Tonight, Sun Records","Good history of the Label. Some good interveiws. Unfortunately, Sam Phillips is a Blowhard!!Would have liked to have seen more original footage from the early years, maybe more stories from that time, less politics. Would have liked to know more about the songs."
1,"Watch out -- ""new"" may mean""unused outdated""","I ordered this book new for my Spanish class and paid top dollar. What received was an unused outdated edition, which could have been purchased on ebay for one tenth the cost. It was useless foir my class, since the assignments were based on the most recent edition.I wrote a bad review of the seller. I returned the book at my expense. The seller refused to refund my money unless I removed my bad review. I removed the review and received my money back but was stuck for the return postage.Watch out like a hawk for misrepresentations on this product.Also I am disgusted with Amazon for allow sellers to refuse to refund money if you write a bad review."
3,purchase,"Seller was more than accomodating to get the book here by the time my daughter left for school. Thanks so much! We received second edition as listed when item was purchased. Unfortunately, my daughter's professor stated that it was ""incorrect"" and she could not use it is the classroom."
3,average,The quality of this book was not as high as I was led to expect by the description. The spine was more worn and there was more writing in the book than I thought there would be.
3,"Nice selection of their best, but could've been more.....","I don't know if MASTERS had publishing rights on any more of The Everly Brothers catalog, but 15 to 20 more songs of similar length could've easily fit on this CD, which truly would've made it an exceptional release. However, if any EB fan had to pick 10 favorites, these would be the ones give or take. I purchased this CD around the time it was released in a bargain bin at a Camelot Music store, back when the only Amazon was in South America."
3,it was a gift,"i was alittle disappointed with this. i had it sent to my friend whos birthday it was and when i did finally see it i thought it wasnt as 'awesome' as i thought it would be, tinny smaller and had no wow factor :("
1,why its just disappointing,as you read across the line u realise that the pictures are cut off in my kindle. Ive downloaded just doomed and the pictures are interesting.I downloaded this for my nine year old son and he said that it was too gross and he wished he didnt learn the tactics from the book.JUst a Big reminder to all that I bought this at early stages so things might hae changed
4,Just Disgusting,"This book is really good, it is good to have a laugh it has funny and disgusing things but the problem is that some of the stories are over boared."
2,No detail discription = Lame Targets.....,"The picture shows multiple variety of targets and states that there will be 100 of them. One lame, small type came... very lame, very deceiving ad... /:<"
1,I am sorry,"The other review was also writen by me. I wrote it before buying the product. Now that I have the pad, I learned it is really bad. It is just like a mouse pad but is long."
3,The cool key pad,"This is an OK pad. It is a little exspensive, but it is still a good bargain. When you type for long hours the pad helps your finger relax."
5,A referece book for Carbonate Microfacies,I love this book. I had old addition of it but I had lost that. Now I am happy to have its new addition. It provides a foundation to understand limestone microfacies and to interpret depositional environments. I have no hesitation to say that this book is a milestone in my professional career as a carbonate petrographer.
2,Crooked Cuts,"The MK 370 is lightweigt and powerful enough for the average do it your selfer,however the chrome slide rail system must be re-engineered. I find it next to impossible to make accurate or straight cuts while using this saw. I would certainly like to upgrade to the 770k or the 101prok but do not want to experience the same problems."
4,Almost great,"The MK-370K is ideal for my home projects, bathroom and kitchen, but I am disappointed in the water recirculation system. While it works, it is not well thought out, takes constant attention and interferes with the smooth operation of the sliding table. In fact, it looks more like an afterthought than an the critical and integral part it is. I am certain that eventually it will be redesigned and the unit will be greatly improved. Unfortunately, this will probably be done by the Japanese."
4,Not a bad tile saw,I had the opportunity to break in the MK-370EXP on a smaller job with pretty much satisfying results. I found a few ways of using this saw that were very helpful. The single complaint that I do have is the water pump. A pump that does not have a TOP feed would be most welcome!! The hose protruding from the top impedes table movement. I will recommend this saw for most jobs. I am pretty satisfied.Kris WittlieffPinedale Wyoming
1,Very disapointed,The saw met my expectations.... when it worked. I have used it for less than one hour cutting about 50 linear feet of tile and the saw locked up. After talking with the service repair station it turns out that MK has had a lot of these problems and yes they repair it but there is only a one year warranty so good luck at plannning on keeping this tool in working order for a long period of time.
4,Saw is a winner but,This is going to be a good purchase minus the junk stand. The junk stand almost cost me the saw right out of the chute. Set the saw upon a couple of saw horses with a discarded plywood for a table and save yourself some grief.
1,A horrific selection of a marvellous recording.,"This 'High lights' version reflects the utter ignorance of the editor.The entire work is a wonderful recording led by Marriner, with Baltsa, Allen, Araiza, Lloyd et al.In the original score of Rossini, the Comte di Almaviva got the largest share of singing with Rosina. Figaro comes only humbly at the third with just one solo aria.Then in this selection, the Comte di Almaviva got 'zero' pieces, just ensembles.The solo arias picked were Figaro's and Rosina's, that's all. Rosina isn't even Figaro's fiance or girl friend. All the courtship music by the Comte were missing, and what is the 'worst', is that this recording includes the Comte's last showpiece in the Finale, sung to great height by Francisco Araiza.That the editor missed that one out and comes out with a shorter than usual measured disc is truly horrific.The disc really deserves 'zero' stars, if that be available."
1,Do you really need cliff's FOR THIS?,Don't deny yourself the pleasure of experiencing this work. Take the time to read. Let's stop this nonsensical quick-fix philosophy.....
3,Not as shown,"Be aware: the batteries this vendor is selling are not individually packaged as shown. The ones I received came off a bulk tape roll of batteries, with no expiry dates to indicate they are still good, or anything else to indicate they were even meant for commerical sale. I have not tried them yet - so cannot comment on their actual state/fitness - but it's definetely not as-shown. Why can't vendors submit an actual a picture of what they are selling....."
1,Ripoff--Battery died four months later,"The battery seemed inexpensive and was quickly shipped. But it did not have an expiration date and no original packing and now it died four months later. The previous battery I bought from Target lasted more than 3 years in the same calculator. So even though this battery seemed inexpensive, for the amount of time it lasted it was really expensive--$18 and 12 batteries is the equivalent of one brand new battery... This is a ripoff...."
2,Lasted only 8 months in my car key remote,"I purchased this to replace the batteries in my two Toyota Prius car key remote/fobs. I purchased them and installed them 8 months ago, and now the warning light is lit up again to tell me to replace them again. The original key batteries received with the car lasted over 5 years. I wish I knew what the difference in batteries was."
3,its a battery.,"What to say, its a battery. It works, it makes things go, or light up etc. I really wish products would quit using these kinds of batteries though as they are always so much more expensive then a AAA or AAAA."
4,Hope it lasts!,"I did my homework and purchased this battery versus paying $4.99 in the stores. Unfortunately, it did not arrive as shown in the first picture listed but rather the second and third picture. (So why even show the first picture?). The battery arrived within 5 days of being ordered, no tax and free shipping. I needed a new battery for my odometer on my mountain bicycle and upon receiving the battery immediately installed it. Well... it is working perfectly! I'll update this site as to how long it lasts since no expiration date is on the battery or package. My last battery had a life span of 3.5 years so I'll keep my fingers crossed it gives me at least 1/2 of the original one."
4,Good batteries,The batteries seem to be fresh - I couldn't see a date on the packaging as they came from a blister pack.They look like they're doing their job so far but it's only been a couple of weeks - only time will tell if they last long.Other than that - fast shipping and packaged OK.
4,Great Value!!!,Has your system battery in your computer ever gone dead and every time you restart your computer you find that the date and time has been reset?Have you gone to the store to find a replacement CR2032 battery and find them to be expensive in some stores?That's why this is a good deal.I ordered two of these system batteries; one as a replacement and the other as a spare and both of them cost only 3 dollars plus shipping. This is great considering in some stores you could pay 5 dollars or more for one.
4,Just Fine,"Ordered from seller ""National Deals."" Order arrived promptly. As others have said, product came in bulk packaging without an expiration date, but the manufacturing year on mine was 2011 and the battery tested to about 3.2V."
3,Its a battery...,not sure there is much else to be said. Came as pictured and described. Seemed to work and last and average amount of time.
3,not as shown,haven't used these yet but came in a cell pack off a roll with no expiration date and not as shown in the picture. Hopefully they work ok!
5,Hard to beat for price,"I had to get a new battery for my XM radio remote control. This was the size I needed, but I never thought about getting it on Amazon. I went to the drug store and paid over $5.00 for the same battery. When I went home to install it I thought I would just check to see if Amazon had one online. Sure enough, I bought this one and took the one I purchased from the drug store back for a refund. I even told the counter person that I had to return it due to the price. So far the battery works just fine."
5,Not made of plastic,"This pepper mill is a model of good design. IT HAS NO PLASTIC PARTS, except possibly on the interior grinding mechanism. The reviewer who says that it is made in China seems to have purchased a knock-off. The Rosle mill sold by Amazon is authentic and works perfectly and is easy to use.Rosle Pepper Mill"
3,A little off kilter,"I applaud Jon Gould's ability to publish a book of short-shorts, and to bring it such critical acclaim.Overall, the quality is a little uneven, but that's true of any collection -- it's just made more noticeable by the fact that there are 55 stories in this slim volume, and thus more fluctuation up and down. Having read this book many months ago, few of the stories continue to stand out in my mind (only one, really, about an entomologist falling in love), and that is ultimately why I could only award this book three stars.If you like the literary short-short, give it a shot; but if your tastes run to longer works, you may be best off looking elsewhere."
3,Worst Diplomats album Ive ever heard,"I have been a fan of Dipset since Cam was on Vialator, you people dont kno what you are talking about this album, it sucks. There are 3 maybe 4 songs that I like thats it. Every other song has been on mixtapes for the past year and a half. If you people have been listening to the mixtape circuit you would feel the same way. Step your music listening up. I only give this album a 3 is because I am a big fan of Dipset and will alwyas support their Movement u need to be in tune wit. Holla"
1,Worst so called rapper in the business,"The man is hustler, good buisness man, but there's one thing he isn't, an thats a rapper! The mofo must be tone deaf, and He can't even put together a decent rhyme scheme. I saw the video to that Miami joint and I have to say that this fool has the worst delivery,rhymes,and subject matter i've ever heard.Damn it, everybody can't be a rapper. Just because you sold drugs doesn't mean you can but together 16 bars of entertainment. DIP SET IS THE WORST RAP CRUE EVER PUT TOGETHER Don't get me started on that mother goose rhymin' mofo camron. I think Vanilla Ice could take Jim Jones in a battle. I think weird Al could take jim too. If you bought this album your mom should have aborted you, and your IQ is lower than Beetle Juice!"
4,Jim Jones is doin big things,"After buyin the previous album (on my way to church)I thought Jim Jones was a weak rapper, the only 2 cuts I liked off it were certified gangstas, and crunk music. But on this album he really did his thing, better beats, better rhymes, and he proved he don't need Killa Cam to make a hit single. I'm a dipset fan and I feel Jim Jones really proved why he's Capo status.THIS ALBUM IS FIRE IF YOU'RE A DIPSET FAN YOU NEED TO GO GET THIS!!!"
4,Not great but its good,"2005 Harlem: Diary of a Summer is a decent album. I cant give it 5 stars because Cam'Ron wasn't on any of the songs. Top 5 Harlem, G's Up, Penitentiary Chances, Baby Girl, and J.I.M.M.Y."
4,Jim stepped his game up,A lot of hot tracks with a couple not so good ones. Overall an ill album. A lot of guest appearances. Jim spits raw through every beat on the album even through the rnb sounding tracks he keeps it gully. Dipset all day.
4,Harlem: Diary Of A Summer,"Is Jim Jones a Lyricist? NO. Do the raps make sense? Umm...sometimes. Is he just using rap as a way to make money? Most likely. The dude is a hustler, love him or hate him he's most likely a fan first and just does this for some extra cash. You shouldn't take this too seriously. It is what it is. A mediocore rapper w/some dope beats. The production on the LP does sound good especially when you're drivin w/your boys. Its an aquired taste and definetly one of my guilty pleasures. Give it a listen and see what you think. Peace!"
3,On his way to church and got lost in harlem,"Theres not much more to say than that.Theres a few good tracks on here, but not was good as His first album. Penetentiary chances, G's up, and JIMMY are pretty good. But not great. If you absolutely LOVED his first one, youll prolly like this one. If you thought the last one was O.K. dont bother with this one. Just have to wait for his third one."
3,Decent but not great,"This is a decent album but it's nothing ground breaking. His first CD was much better actually and Cam and Juelz are both better. I'd recommend getting Juelz's masterpiece ""What The Game's Been Missing"" instead but if you already have that, than I guess you could get this too. Just don't expect anything ground breaking."
1,One of the Worst CDs of all time,"I just got this today, and I was hoping to hear a good album for a change. But unfortunately, I was wrong. From start to finish, this CD was boring, repetitive, and it made me wish that I were deaf the whole time (at least temporarily). I wanted to warn you not to get this one before you waste almost 20 dollars like me."
