4,I like The Boss,I liked the fact that the songs were intros to general philosophising rather than simple stories about where the author was and what he was doing when he first heard the song (as is so often the case). This made it more interesting when the artists aren't those I like (e.g. Annie de Franco).
3,Saws well but requires frequent carburetor adjustment,"The saw cuts like a dream. When it runs, that is. I live in the mountains at 7250 feet, so perhaps the altitude is involved. But only after repeatedly adjusting the carburetor would the saw start readily and remain running at an idle speed. I would estimate the total engine ""tweaking"" time I've invested at two hours plus. It also goes through chain oil like water through a hose (although this problem abates after a couple of hours usage).Still, I'd probably purchase this saw again, simply because similarly priced alternatives are generally total junk. The saw comes with two chains and a sharpening file -- also plusses. The shipping was free and prompt. I'd give the seller a five star rating."
4,Good - but predictable,"I like Louis L'Amour. His descriptions and conversations are top notch. However, his plots are predictable so I really am grading this on a curve.I am also rating the audio version of this book which is interesting because it is told by Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson and Johnny Cash. It was quite enjoyable to hear the four of these men work together - they were all quite good, especially Kristofferson and Nelson. This audio edition has features that most don't, including special effects and a music soundtrack that was sometimes reminescent of Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti Westerns and sometimes reminescent of ""Silverado."" The inclusion of the special effects did speed the plot along (you don't have to describe that people are knocking on the door or riding horses, etc.) but sometimes they are distracting (one scene in particular had an overly loud clock ticking over the top of everyone's voices)."
3,Worth a listen.,"First there was Mantovani with his strings, then Bert Kaempfert added guitars and trumpet to strings, and next came James Last who used full orchestration and voices. The selections on this particular album are very good with 'Elizabethan Serenade'and one of my favourites 'Whiter Shade of Pale' being the standouts. A different version of 'What Now My Love'. The sound quality on this Spectrum label leaves a lot to be desired but other than that, it's not bad."
2,There's always a first time,"I didn't expect this: Awful!! Worse because it's James Last. He must have had a very bad hangover during these performances. Just plain ""blah"". I'll remain a loyal fan, but I wasted my money on this one."
2,cheap cheap cheap..........,cheap cheap cheap..........VERY thin would never buy again...Men's Light Green Dress Shirt w/ Convertible Cuffs sz 17 1/2 34/35....can't recommend!~
5,I had no idea!,"I've had this wonderful book for months and just now realized that the pictures were made by one of my favorite artists (Kathy Murillo). I have to say I really enjoy this book so much, I don't consider myself much of a cooker or a crafter but these projects make me feel like I can do both. My favorite is the bottle of mango vinrgar (easy to make) with the wind chime hanging off of it."
5,"Merrill's psalms serve as a healing, peaceful, restful balm","I have been a fan of Nan Merrill's book, Psalms for Praying, since it first came out in hardcover edition. I recommend it in the list of suggested reading in the back of my book, The Pocket Guide to Prayer. I also highly recommend it at the various prayer workshops I faciliate. As I have spent time with her rendition of the psalms, I have repeatedly discovered a timely phrase to help me prayerfully rest in God's abiding peace and experience God's love more fully. Just today, in fact, the phrase from Psalm 38, ""Be my strength and uphold me,"" is one that has provided a resting place for my troubled spirit and served as a healing balm. I am grateful to Nan for interpreting the psalms in such a way that I, and I suspect many others as well, are able to re-connect with the One who desires that we come away for a while and rest peacefully in God's tender embrace."
2,Praying the Psalms,"Book did not have cover pictured here,I was not pleased. The material of the book is excellent coveering a fresh up to date translation of the psalms in the bible"
3,Quick service!,The book was in good condition although it had a little writing in it when it was said that it didn't have any markings. I was a little disappointed about that & started to return it. Need to look through the books more carefully.Becky
5,Awesome book!,I lost my first copy and so had been looking all over. Love the translation of the Psalms. I always find just what I need!
2,OOOOOOOOHHHHHHH'Brien,"Poor man's Fatal Attraction/ Basic Instinct, but the seduction scene between O'Brien and her lover's younger brother is most memorable. Gotta get the unrated version though. The R version is ridiculously edited, and poorly I might add."
2,Shipping issues and nonexistent customer service!,"BUYER BEWARE!I had stems arrive broken for one of the glasses in this set, and Amazon (thus far) has refused to replace the item. The stems that arrived intact were beautiful. But the failure of Amazon to provide replacements should be taken as a warning by all potential buyers.The item was shipped without any interior packing at all, and minimal exterior packing. As a longtime, loyal Amazon customer, I am severely disappointed in the company and their lack of customer service."
5,"Easy to install, and works great!","I bought this to go with a very ancient garage door opener that I have retrofitted with other Digi-code products (receiver/transmitter). It took me about 10 minutes to program, install, and test this multiple times. I haven't had a single issue since it was installed. My only concern would be when the battery runs out, I hope someone isn't stranded outside, but I imagine that is the possibility with any device that operates on a battery."
2,Can't believe it was a bestseller,"I actually purchased this because he was my mentor in the Writer's Digest School of Novel Writing. What a disappointment! It was the most vile text I've ever read - and I'm no prude - it just seemed as if he wrote it for shock value and nothing more. No emotions, just dumb (literally) characters with limited thought patterns. These characters were definitely only ""skin-deep."""
5,$100 Misunderstanding Still Relevant,"Gover's $100 misunderstanding was written in a time when to use the -F- word in public was criminal; when fraternizing with the Other could lead to a beating, or some serious jail time. Yet, our fascination with the Other goes on today.Gover's book, a love story between a Stepford son (Waspy white frat boy) and the 14 yr old hooker, Kitten, is heartwarming and poignant. Pay attention to the language this guy puts in the mouth of these two characters. Man!Whatever happened to novels of socio-political adventure? Dis one gots laygz."
4,A Work of Satyrical Genius.,"I read this book when it was new, and I doubt there was a page without a belly laugh on it. Other reviewers have commented, and validly so, about the social implications of the book, so I won't repeat them. But what was most memorable for me was the brilliant strategy of alternating chapters between the two protagonists. It brought into sharp contrast the vast gulf that existed between their respective worldviews, and did so in an engaging and hilariously entertaining way.What no one has yet mentioned is that there was at least one sequel: ""Here Goes Kitten."" If I recall correctly, there was also a second sequel whose title eludes me. In the first sequel, Jim and Kitten meet again 20 years or so later, and dance their dance again.The only book I've ever read that made me laugh this hard and long was ""Letters From the Earth"" by Mark Twain--another literary/satirical classic."
3,"Get ""Live From Amsterdam 1985""","This is the original Relix release from 1986 of portions of The Flying Burrito Bros. '85 Amsterdam show. It's got it's moments but in 1997 Relix took the ten tracks found on this cd, added the remaining five tracks from the show and released the entire concert as ""Live From Amsterdam 1985"". It is still a single cd and if it costs any more it's not much. So it would be a good idea to pick that one up rather than this one."
5,Shrek the Halls/Sherek the Third,Purchased for Grandchildren to watch with Grammy over the holidays. Laughed until we cried. Funny!
2,didn't work,"I bought the product for my wife who gets migraines. It had no effect on the length or severity of her migraines. Also, you have to take two pills, so the box has only half the dosages. Will not buy again."
3,Interesting Tarot,"This Tarot was interesting, but not exactly what we were looking for in a Medieval Tarot-themed deck. The minor arcana were especially disappointing."
5,This book takes the panic out of pregnancy.,"Louise Edeiken and Johanna Antar are to be congratulated on their bouncing baby book, Now That You're Pregnant. The book is small, light and totebagable. The no-nonsense checklist format especially appeals to Dads-to-be...no wading through warm, fuzzy paragraphs on the joys of motherhood and feeling left out. Leave it to these two professional organizers.... Who wants to worry about insurance policies and diaper services, labor and lab work when there are bigger issues at stake...macadamia nut or choco-mint with that kosher dill? This book really takes the panic out of pregnancy. It's the best gift you can give or receive."
2,Ineptly made comedy dealing with romantic indecision.,"A cast comprised of three romantically interwoven couples, with an additional pair who spend a good portion of this film discussing their failed relationships, deals hopelessly with a jumbled script and lacklustre direction, eventually sinking beneath the force of hollow purpose. Some of the players, notably Sarah Trigger, Sheryl Lee, and Esai Morales, produced some crackle for their dialogue, but this studentish production softened the effect. This type of scenario, involving cleverly coincidental connections among the cast, is more commonplace today than when this work was released (1994); in this instance, however, all chance of freshness was broken down by weak architectonics."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"This movie is a whole lot of talk with no real surprises, interesting story lines, or interesting characters. I viewed this on DVD due to the fact that it had Heather Graham, whom I loved in Austin Powers 2 and Boogie Nights. She gives a strong performance as do most of the other cast members, however the rest of the cast is filled with no-names which was kind of disappointing. Aside from Heather Graham this movie was not really worth my time. The DVD didnt have a whole lot of extras which was disappointing because that is one of my favorite things about DVD's. Unless you're a big Heather Graham fan like me I suggest not watching this movie on DVD or VHS."
5,Forgotten Favorite,"Wow, had completely forgotten about Lizzy Borden. They were a favorite that I'd forgotten. Was going through cassettes last weekend that were in storage and was reminded. Then I realized I don't even have a cassette player any more.So glad that they had released a ""Best Of""!"
5,Superb,"This is what serious photography is all about. Virtually every shot taken with the 24-105 is crystal clear, taking your images to a professional level. The zoom range makes this quite versatile and a good replacement for a number of consumer-grade lenses I already had.Given the cost of a decent DSLR body, it makes sense to put a decent lens in front of it. It's certainly worth the investment."
2,For a L lens I expect higher quality. Error 01 is a frequent problem.,"Optical quality is excellent. But go search online for ""Canon 24-105mm error 01"" and you find very high number of user experiencing this aperture failure. I am one of those unfortunate user. For an L lens that you pay closer to or over $1000 for I expect 1. higher quality, 2. free repair should such high number of user experience this type of failure. Come on Canon, be responsible and if you know one of your product line is faulty: 1. fix the problem and 2. come clean and offer free repair for the affected user. I have non-L lens that live thru higher usage and more abuse then this. This lens failed 4 years after relatively careful use. Canon, I will continue to post this once a week on major forum until you fix this for all user of this lens for free. Have your quality assurance team go online and see the flood of people with this problem! If you haven't invest too much money on Canon, go to Nikon."
4,Good with 40D,"Strong, heavy and feels solid. Can take good portrait pictures with clean subjects. wide angle can get a little skewed, f/4 all the way to 105mm is an advantage. I am considering a larger f stop to go with this one, preferably at 50mm or so.I use it with 40D and I like it.The hood can cast a shadow on the pictures if not careful."
1,Dreaded err01,"I used this lens for one shoot, and in the middle of the shoot I got an err01 message. Hard to imagine the contacts are dirty when you are in the middle of shooting using the same lens the whole time. In my case the error only occurred when shooting at low aperture settings, for higher apertures it worked fine. After I got the error I swapped in two other lenses, which worked without any problems.It's hard to tell in the days of the internet when you read about problems if a piece of equipment has a design defect, or if you are just reading about the small sample of inevitable failures. Having said that, if you are considering this lens do a google search for canon 24-105 err 01, here is a sample that you might start with: [...]"
2,Bummer,"Oh how I wanted to love this lens...I really did. This was my first ""L"" lens and maybe I was expecting to be blown away, but I just wasn't. I know this lens has great reviews so it's possible that I just got a bad copy but majority of the photos I took with it were blurry or soft, & if I did get a good in focus shot, it just didn't look sharp enough to me at all. I gave it 3 days & tried everything, hoping the issue would somehow just get better, but I just couldn't justify spending so much money on a lens I personally wasn't happy with. So I'm sending this guy back and getting two other lenses in it's place. I will however say that this is one sexy looking lens. The build is excellent, the weight is good, and it looked great on my camera but unfortunately it just didn't work out for me. :("
4,My Favorite Lens,This lens gives me the benefit of filling in the gap between my other lenses. The USM motor is really nice and quiet and the photos are great and clear. Comfortable in my balancing hand and well balanced.
3,Going to sell it or give it away as a gift.,"This lens came with the Mark 5D camera we bought and it is just not that good of a lens. The AF is not fast and the pictures are not that sharp. If I had to start my purchase all over again, I would simply buy only the body and buy my lens separately. I will be either selling the lens on Craigslist or give it to my brother as a gift."
4,Quality lens,"Very good quality lens, feels solid and the picture quality is lovely.Lens ships with UV filter, canon soft case and sun shield."
5,Canon L Lens at its Best,"Got this lens with my Canon 5D Mark II and it is an impressively high performing zoom lens. The image quality is pro grade & the USM (Ultrasonic Motor) AF system delivers quiet, lightning fast and accurate autofocus. The color contrast, saturation and optical performance at every focal length and distance are also excellent.If you've been drooling over this lens for a while, go ahead & pull the trigger. You'd be glad you did."
5,Razor Sharp,"I have been using a Canon 28-135mm IS USM lens for years and it has served me well. I recently upgraded to this lens and wow what a diffrence in every category! First the IS is much better with this lens, it is so much sharper than my old lens I would have never believed it if I had not seen it. I would highly recommend this lens to my friends."
4,Nice but...,Yes it is a very fine lens. IS and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this I decided to sell it in favour of my EF 24-70 2.8L after 2 weeks of usage.f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier. Bokeh is also worse than the other one.the viewfinder gets darker in 1.6 crop bodies.105 mm does make a very little difference in image size.Plus the macro option is weaker on this one.If you don't care about the weight go with the EF 24-70 2.8L imho.
5,One outstanding walkaorund lens,"This was my first lens with Canon 30D and I have no other lens to compare it with. But comparing my shots with online photos taken with this lens I say it proved its merit. Also after some test shots I sent it back to Canon Service to see if mine was ""not that sharp"". After their calibration (that was their feedback), the photos turn out to be much sharper. I love the bokeh on this lens and the saturation of colors. Makes you look and feel professional, people tend to give you their approval to take their pictures because, one - it is not too long to be invasive and intimidating; two - not too short to be amateurish. But I have to let it go to get a faster lens ~ 70-200mm f2.8 IS as I love shoot in natural light. Get this, you won't be disappointed."
2,Has its Pros and Cons,This lens has been my go-to lens for nearly 3 years now. It is a great out door lens or whenever you have plenty of light. The 24mm on a 5D full censor makes for great wide shots. Don't be fooled by it's f4.0 when shooting video however. I have found that it produces an awful video image at f4.0 and will NEVER look in focus no matter what you do. The lowest you can go is f5.6 to get a clear image. Very disappointing. The sooner you learn that the less work you destroy the minute you capture it. I wouldn't pay the money for it again knowing what I know.
2,Quality way below expectation,"During extensive testing of the lens on a Canon Xsi (12MP) I found the lens to be very sharp in the center of the picture on all zoom levels, but the edge of the lens was quite another matter.All the pictures were taken at 1/40 f4.5 ISO 400. At 24 mm the vignetting (darker corners) is very noticeable. The lens is also quite soft outside the center of the photo. The vignetting improves as the zoom increase, but the softness improves only marginally.The build quality and feel of this lens is great, but none of those thing matters if the photographic quality of the lens is not up to par. The quality of this lens was so poor that I suspect it was defective. The lens has been returned and I am looking forward to receiving an exchange. Based on all reviews and test, this should be a much better lens than the one I tested.Links to test photos,[...]"
3,"Distortion, Distortion",I bought this lens as part of a package deal with the Canon 5D Mark ii. I am able to take satisfactory images in a landscape setting but I was very disappointed when shooting at 24mm in a closer setting such as in house-photography. The distortion was prominent and unacceptable for a lens of this advertised quality and price. I was able to take better images on my 40D with a Tamron wide angle with virtually no distortion.
1,Defective Unit,"I was extremely disappointed in this lens because of the extremely slow focus. I initially thought it was normal behavior of the lens but I compared it to my 18-55mm (kit lens) and other USM lenses. It literally takes up to 20 seconds at times to focus because of how slow it is. It doesn't matter whether it is in good or poor light situations, it is always the same.Unfortunately I no longer live in the USA and now have no way of returning it to the vendor. How sad..."
5,Great lens,"This is my walkaround lens. My friends are in awe of the pictures I get I'm an amateur and have been using this lens with my Mark II 5D Canon since Christmas. I also have a Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens, I get such great pictures. I'm so thrilled to have this camera and these lenses. So expensive though. I've saved all my life and in my retirement, I'm fortunate to be able to own these items. I want to get a wide angle lens sometime this year. I still don't have a flash either, so I'm learning a lot about using natural light. I'm ""gentle king"" on Flickr if you want to check out my amateur pictures."
5,Beautiful,A fine lens I use extensively on many different jobs with great results. Great range on cropped sensor bodies and a nice wide angle on a full frame sensor. If you can afford the price you should be pleased.
5,Very useful lens,"I bought this lens to replace my venerable 35-105 EF which has served me well. As I grow older and shakier I wanted to try the IS feature.The 24-105 f/4.0 IS lens is very good as is typical of L glass and, although I have not tested it carefully, the image stabilization does seem to help. It is an excellent (although expensive) choice for a general purpose (walk around?) lens. Very sharp - convenient controls - useful zoom range. I keep it on the camera most of the time. It would be nice to have a 2.8 aperture but then the lens would probably cost more than my 5D. Higher ISO's are now quite practical and this pretty much overcomes the f/4.0 objection.Highly recommended.rps"
5,What a Fabulous Lens,"I am using this lens with a Canon 30D and am totally in love. This is my all around standard lens. It has a good range covering both pretty decent wide settings and a throw that can cover most situations. I previously had a 28-135, but returned it for this lens. This one is a much stronger and higher quality build as well as being faster and cleaner. The inclusion of the hood was also an added bonus since these range from $30 to $50.Cons: The only con I found with the lens is the location of the zoom wheel. It sits too far back on the barrel of the lens so that it is almost snug up on the body of your camera. I would have preferred it to be where the 28-135mm located its, in the middle of the lens."
1,Watch Out - $284 to fix. My 24-105L Malfunctioned After 1 Yr Warranty expired.,"While I'm satisfied with the lens performance when it worked. Before you buy, take into account the lens only has a 1 year warranty. Nikon in contrast offer a 5 yr US warranty. I thought any imperfections in a lens would be caught within 1 year, and that the chances of a lens failing after a year was very low. I was mistaken.A few weeks ago the lens malfunctioned with my 7D giving me an ERR 01 code (just as my kid finished a cross country race). I cleaned the contacts on lens and camera (about 3 times) per the user manual for an Err 01, but the error kept on occurring intermittently freezing the camera. Adding to the mystery, the lens works fine with my old XT. I have sent the lens into Canon's factory service per their direction and have been quoted $284 to repair it. It's unfortunate Canon don't stand by their products as Nikon does - especially their heralded, expensive quality ""L"" lenses!"
4,Swiss Army Lens,"I bought this lens used from a reputable source. I checked the focus and contrast on my Canon 5D III and found it sharp, has decent contrast with very good colors (for a zoom of this range).The real surprise was how good the Image Stabilization is. An early trip to my local redwood forest to photograph fern-lined streams was literally enlightening. Even though the it's only an f4, I took very low light shots using IS and a high ISO (3200 and 6400) - hand held ! This combo has really made me think twice about lugging my Gitzo around. (Well, maybe not :-/Autofocus is average and not up to sports in low-light. But I doubt this will be a primary use of this lens.Hmmm.. maybe it's a 5 star ???"
4,Nice but costly compared to the 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS,"I have both lenses, the 24-105 4 L IS and the 28-135 3.5-5.6 IS. I have a 20D, but my wife and I decided we each wanted a camera to ourselves so I bought the 24-105 lens along with the 30D about 2 months ago. I was so sure that I'd see a big difference with the L lens since my 70-200 2.8 IS L is such a superior lens. The thing is, I can't justify it. I've set the camera on a tripod and switched the lenses back and forth taking pictures with identical light and settings on a variety of subjects. (They both take extremely nice pictures) Maybe with a full frame sensor the difference would be apparent. At this point I like the extra reach of the 135mm. I'll let my wife use the $1200 L lens. My recommendation is: for the money on a cropped sensor camera I'd stick with the 28-135 lens."
5,My first zoom lens,"This is my first lens aside from the kit lens 18-55mm that I have. It is true when they name the 24-105mm lens as a street lens because it has a good reach in terms of its zoom capability. It has a very good resolution even at its top reach of 105mm and the IS helps a lot in the stability in shooting the subject at 105mm. I have tried shooting birds at the beach using the 24-105mm f4 is lens, of course it is not the appropriate lens for the job but as I tried zooming in to the bird that a shoot in my computer I was amazed with the outcome. It only gives me the impression that getting a lens with more reach is worth it as long as it is canon. But it is still a good idea to use my kit lens 18-55mm because the wide angle capability of it is still better that that of 24-105mm lens. For some enthusiats who wants to complete the line of lens I think getting a much wider than 24mm is good and a telephoto lens with a 2.8 aperture and with a reach of 200mm or more preferable with IS."
5,For me the best walkaround lens!,"Awesome Lens! Although it is not f2.8, the IS and the additional range compensate for it. I took a lot of great pictures using this lens and I couldn't be happier. Worth the investment :)"
5,Great walk-around lens,"This is the one you want to take on vacations, hiking, backpacking, anytime you need to consider weight and space. Granted, there are 'super-zooms' with much bigger zoom range, but they are only 'super' until you take a look at the results, namely the pictures. This one is actually sharp enough, contrasty enough, and with reasonably controlled chromatic aberration, that the pics taken will bear being looked at without causing eye pain.Note: the zoom range really works better for the full frame bodies than the APS-C ones, but your mileage may vary, depending on your shooting style."
3,Love it or Hate it I guess.,"I have owned this lens for a couple of months now and can say that I am not blown away with it like I was with the Canon 24-70L 2.8. I thought that the idea of having a longer lens would be nice and it is, but it does not make up for the F4 aperture throughout. Indoors with low light, I have trouble with this lens focusing and can only get away with turning up the ISO. Outdoors with a lot of light, this lens does great. The IS makes shooting long a breeze. If you are going to spend a lot on a lens, I would suggest getting something with a larger aperture.Pros:-Price vs the 24-70L-Solid build-Great outdoors-Canon L grade lens-Able to adjust focus on the flyCons:-F4-Easier to get dust inside because of how the zoom works-Need a flash with low light or tripodIt's a good lens, but if you are looking for a great lens look at the Canon 24-70L 2.8"
5,I love this lens.,"My stock lens had been a Sigma 18-200 and I was getting excellent results with it until I added a Canon 100-200mm zoom. The difference in quality between the two lenses was very noticable so I tried the 24-105mm and love it. It is heavier than the Sigma, but the results are very good. Autofocus is fast and locks on very well, the f/4 lets in lots of light even on the top end and is very functional across a wide range of photo uses. If I was putting together a lens/camera body combination for the first time, this is the combination I would go with."
4,Almost too much of a lens for a consumer-grade camera like the XT,"This is a great lens, but XT users should be aware that the ""L"" series is truly a heavyweight line of lenses. This was the first L lens I ever purchased. I have an XT and when the lens came I was taken aback by how much more substantial the lens is compared to my camera body. It's almost too much of a lens for a consumer-grade camera. Having said that, however, I have nothing but praise for its performance."
2,Not any better than stock lens,"Sorry to say this lens does not take pictures any better than my stock 18-55 lens. When I paid $1,000 I was expecting to be impressed by some increase in picture quality. It was hard to tell a difference, even harder to justify the steep price.I may be no professional photographer, as you may tell that I am not ""blown away"" by the L in the lens name. Yes, the lens is sturdy and it has a nice feel. It also adds an extra 2 pounds on my camera. Yes, it does take great pictures, but nothing amazing, not any better than the lens my Canon Rebel came with.Unless I received a second quality item, it does not justify not even a $300 price, let alone the steep $1,000.I will return the item."
3,Algo decepcionado,"Compre este lente para reemplazar a mi 28-135 IS co el cual siempre obtuve buenas fotografias. El 24-105 L IS esta magnificamente construido pero no es lo suficientemente Sharp..., sera mi copia ? Lo he probado en mis dos camaras : 40D y XSi. Siempre necesita trabajo en mi Lightroom. Lo mismo me ocurre con el 17-40L pero en menor medida. Mi proxima compra sera el 135 L f2, espero que sea el lente Sharp que busco..!"
2,"Not sharp at night photo and has a scratch , I contacted the seller, but I didn't hear nothing back","I didn't have to use this lens in June. The lens was refurbished, but it doesn't mean that it can have a scratch. Also the night shots are not sharp. I used two different camera bodies and turned off IS. The pictures still have poor quality.I contact the seller, but they ignored me."
4,Great for classroom!,"I bought this CD after reading another review of it. We primarily listen to it as my class of second graders is doing independent writing or working on a project. It is calming, entertaining, and a great backdrop to have as we are working. I will be looking into other works by Klaus Badelt."
1,Broke on first use.,"Despite being careful, this bit broke the first time out, drilling a 'just-set' bit of JB-Weld. I would look elsewhere for a #60."
4,Dear Sir or Madam - This is a good book.,Just the ticket a quick template and short tips.When they talk about busy people they are serious. This book is not full of chapter upon chapter of what to do. Rather it is templates for almost all occasions with marginal notes expaling what to add and why.A Great Timesaver !
4,What I think,This book is geared more for the non professional. I thought that it would have more info for the perdonal behind the desk. It is still informative.
1,"not what it claims, not about manners","This video is DREADFUL. It should NOT be sold under Manners. ONLY ONE of the four stories even REMOTELY relates to manners and it sends a confusing message with Piglet's asking Tigger to ""Please stop saying 'please.'"" The other three stories are irrelevant and time-wasters if you SERIOUSLY bought this video to teach any manners. Also, a child would have to be a good reader to understand the point of the second story about a confusing WRITTEN note left by Pooh. IT has nothing to do with manners, either. This is a ""get your money back"" piece of mislabelling."
5,KANGA AND ROO!!!!!!!!!,"The Book of Pooh is spectacular! And now even better with the addition of Kanga and Roo. Those puppets are so cute! The stories are really good too. The first one Tigger plays a detective in search of a Donkey. He puts clues together and finds Erroye making sanwiches. Really cute. The next one is about Tigger and Roo. Tigger tells a story of tall Tales all about the ""Rooasouras"" These 4 stories seem to be very in depth and have even more computer animation then before, like lakes, rain, etc. Amazingly done and with Kanga and Roo added, as close to perfection as it could get!"
1,Nothing too great as most proclaim...,"This book comes from a person who is into legends and lore. I'll give him credit for that much of his book. The information he talks about is not 100% accurate, the dates are wrong as one example. For someone who is suppose to be an expert in the field, only makes you wonder where he got the information. To my knowledge its all legneds & lore in the book and no actual research. The tours he gives is basically a bar hopping event, makes you wonder why they see spirits. I couldn't find him to ask a question at one of the off the bus stops, maybe he is also a ghost. The tour was more of a party bus and its goes so quick by some of the locations you barely see anything. If your looking for a party take his tour."
3,the stranger,I would like to say the book was so-so. I give it a three star rating. It gives you a sense of curiosity. I realy like this book.I would advise that you read this book to. there are some things he could improve on. He could have made the book longer.otherwise it was goodthe stranger is a very good book. If you like mystierious books you should read the stranger
3,The Stranger- very strange,"I think this book was very, well- strange. With no good morals or real plot... this book just baffles me. The ""stranger"" stays with a family after getting hit by by a car? That isn't a good thing to teach our childern... the guy who hit him didn't even get in trouble. Then the seasons stop... that phsically impossible. The earth would have to stop spinning. Then, at the end, the ""stranger"" just leaves...Over all, I thought that this was the strangest book that I have ever read. I would say..."
5,Great Book for VV.,"I bought this book to use for introductory exercises for the Lindamood-Bell Visualizing and Verbalizing program (""V/V""). It works best with the Picture X Picture activity. The pictures are detailed and have interesting, subtle complexity. I can't wait to buy the Polar Express!"
1,The Stranger,"This book is about a man who suddenly appeared on a road. He was invited by a family. They lived on a quiet farm. He was so awkward.I don't think this book is a very good book. Wild animals came to him and they didn't care what he did to them. When I read this book, I thought he was an unknown alien. In autumn, the pumpkins grew very huge!One day, when he climbed the highest hill on the Bailey farm, he looked to the north. The trees there were yellow and orange. But the Baileys' trees were green.This book made me feel confused. He couldn't talk, or dress himself. He is one weird person.If you think you like this book, read it, I rather say don't. Read this book if you think it is good. This book is easy to read. It might have difficult words in it. I would say that anybody can read this."
2,The Stranger- very strange,"I think that this book was the strangest book that I'll have ever read. First off... the ""stranger"" is hit by a car... and doesn't die? That is bad to show to out childern. The guy who hits the ""stranger"" doesn't even get in trouble. Then, the seasons don't change... that is impossible... since seasons are caused by the earth's rotation."
1,The dumb book.,"The doctor used a broken thermometer, so we thought it was dumb. We didn't like the part when the stranger played with the rabbits. We thought the doctor was dumb.The story was realy dumb so we will never ever read it a gen. we liked the part when he heard a thump and thought it was a deer and when he got out of the truck and he is stupid.-+"
5,Highly unusual picture book,"I was introduced to Mr. Van Allsberg's books when I was young-- my father loved the illustrations and sparked my fascination with these picture books. What I love about ""The Stranger"" is that, unlike so many other children's books that tell simple stories in a very linear fashion with easily identifiable morals and characters, this book is elusive and enigmatic. Like ""The Mysteries of Harris Burdick"" it is concerned with leaving loose ends so that the reader can tie it together on his/her own. I, aged 21, find this story stimulating and fascinating and think it is a wonderful eye opener in the world of children's books, a book that haunts with gorgeous images and unique storytelling."
4,Haven't seen the transfer but a worthy buy,"This movie is crazy, for gore fans and cannibal fans alike, as if they're different. Very cool that this is being released, can't wait for the slightly superior sequel, Cannibal Holocaust, to be released on DVD."
4,Best Cannibal Movie,"If you are curious about the infamous Spaghetti Cannibal genre then this is the movie to start with. It's a real jungle adventure from beginning to end with beautifully weird music. I would give it five stars if it was possible to watch the movie without the scenes of animal killings. The interview with the lead actor is painful to watch but worth it for the line ""That sheep's liver was my destiny"" (or something like that). Many people skip this one and go right to Deodato's other movie in the genre, Cannibal Holocaust. I don't really consider that a representative cannibal movie as it is more artistically disturbing and seems to have a deeper meaning about human trust. Jungle Holocaust is just a fun movie where the cannibals really are cannibals and want to eat you for the same reason you might enjoy a well cooked leg of lamb. They take even take the time to properly prepare and season their meals. Buon Appetito!"
3,Quite Entertaining,"Deodato's precursor to the infamous Cannibal Holocaust, this movie is one of the finer films in the cannibal movie genre. Has everything you would expect (i.e. feasts on human flesh) and nothing you wouldn't expect (like a plot). The film purports to be based on actual events, which I think makes the film all the more amusing. My one critique is that the natives all looked too carefully manicured and shaven to be savages. But this is a trivial matter. If you're new to the genre this is a great place to begin."
1,awful,I stopped this film half way through and put it in the bin.There is no excuse for such animal cruelty being passed off as entertainment.
3,FINALLY on dvd!,"This flick is not that good, great first try by Ruggero Deodato. But now it's on DVD! Finally! The Flick is about a plane crash with a team on it. 2 of them are killed. 1 disappears. One is left by himself to face off cannibals. All he can depend on is the help from a cannibal woman who befriends him. Check out Cannibal Holocaust, it's way better."
5,day and night by schiller,"very good visuals and the quess artist are great specially kim sanders....if you like electronic music i recomend this dvd ,this is the second schiller dvd that i have...."
3,Something is missing... I did not get into the concert!!!,"The concert is good, but I think the video and its edition is not so good... looks fine, audio is good in DTS format, but something is missing.... It doesn't get you inside the concert... passion is missing... maybe is the video and audio edition or maybe is the concert itself....I like to buy video concerts which get you in the place, create the mood, and it doesn't do that... for that reason I do not recommend it.. if you want to buy it, do it, but do not expect the best."
4,The Horror!,"This shows the horror of Nazi Germany from yet another point of view. It is highlighted by the deep love the non-Jewish women had for thier Jewish husbands, love as deep as the Germans were cruel. The horror lasted for more than a generation, when it finally could be put to rest, at least by one woman, by facing the past. This was a difficult movie to watch, but the ending helped to justify it."
5,Women of Great Courage and Devotion!,"I saw this movie in a N.Y. movie house. It was superb! The acting was outstanding! These courageous German women impressed me deeply. I have read and seen a number of films about Germans who challenged the Nazis,and although it was too bad there wasn't more of it, some sacrificed a great deal. The film suggests the main character's relationship to Goebbels was influential to the release of the Jewish spouses being held by the Nazis. I don't beleive this was fact however, I am still personally researching the matter. In addition to opposing the Nazis, she also protects a young Jewish girl. There are numerous flashbacks and there is plenty of intense drama. I have heard of many women who have fought for many issues held dear to them, but these women battled against some horrific odds. Although the movie is in German(English Sub-titles) don't let it stop you from getting a copy of this movie. I wish American actresses could give such performances. A must see!"
4,Very helpful tutorial,"I wish I had watched this tutorial when I first bought the Pinnacle studio 12. This tutorial taught me lots of short cuts and now I can save time and create a movie much faster. I have been using Pinnacle since past 5 years. However, I explored many hidden potentials only through this video. Consequently, I highly recommend this video training to be purchased along with the Studio 12.I gave this a 4 and not 5 star because of two principle reasons:(a) I was not able to play this video in my normal DVD player connected to my TV, my dvd player is not up to date.(b) It would have been nice if common trouble shooting items were discussed on this training even though Pinnacle support is quite good for this. All in all, I am very pleased with the purchase and highly recommended to those who purchased or is looing forward to purchasing Studio 11 or a later version."
4,Great book!,"I read this book as a child, and loved it. It is a wonderful adventure along the lines of ""The Count of Monte Christo""."
2,The dullest of the Spot movies,"My 2 year old son loves the original Spot movie -- Spot on the Farm. So, I bought this one -- and it is too slow for a little kid. Not much happens, and the entire video is one story, unlike the others that offer 4 vignettes of a child's adventure. Both of us were bored, and he never asked to see it again."
4,psychological thriller,"i remember this movie from when I was a young girl growing up in Europe, but haven't seen it in years. Romy Schneider was a great actress and that alone makes it worth seeing. It impressed me so much at the time, I'll give it four stars...also recommended: Chabrol's ""The Butcher"" (Le Boucher)."
3,Ahead of its time,"Like Hitchcock films, this was ahead of it's time for 1975. Of course today it's dated with cliches but consider movies like this started the cliches for all movies that followed. When taken into context Dirty Hands is pretty good."
2,"like a made for tv movie, but in french, with nudity","The man who made La Ceremonie & La Boucher is bound to have a few clunkers in his repetoire, & Innocents with Dirty Hands fits the bill. The film fits into almost every suspense cliche I can think of; the most prominant being the stale story of the pretty girl who marries the fat,unattractive man for his money, then finds a young stud who helps plot and execute his murder.The twists are tired and easy to predict, and while the camera work is skilled & occasionally quite fun to watch, it doesn't make up for the plodding storyline and silly theatrics.And could someone please tell me why everyone is speaking in French except for Rod Steiger, whose mouth is moving over words in English, yet dubbed and subtittled in French?If you're looking for quality suspense, keep looking."
5,Brilliant. A must for sports fans,"Have loved the 30 for 30 Vol 1 DVD series by ESPN. Not being an American many of the stories I only had a passing understanding of, but the documentary work of the filmmakers brought those stories to life. If you're a sports fan, this series is a must. Loved be engrossed!"
4,Great Gift,We purchased this DVD set for our father and he loves them. The storylines are great and full of footage. Made for the perfect gift to any sports fan!
5,Awesome!,These videos are a must watch for all sports fans. I can't wait until the next 15 are released in a box set.
4,Interesting,"I don't know that there are any bombshells here, or any lessons to be learned. Just a reminder of what an interesting and strange story Richards' playing on the women's tour was. As with most ESPN-distributed stuff this is more a nostalgia trip that a deep piece, but it is interesting."
5,Great dvds,I love the 30 for 30 series and so does my dad. Bought them for him for Father's day and he was very happy. The packaging is nice and keeps everything together.No complaints with the dvds.
5,Great gift for both my very athletic sons.,"Great choices, stories. Well written, not just all hype, but true info without all the hoopla that news accounts bring with them."
5,Great set of ESPN films...,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew. Last year I purchased the ESPN 30-for-30 Volume 2 and he absolutely loved it, and requested Volume 1 for Christmas. A must have for any sports enthusiast!"
5,Great Movies!,"I got this for my father this Christmas, and was pleasantly surprised. The packaging was very nice, and most of the the videos look interesting. I have not yet seen any of the movies that I purchased, but the ones I've seen on ESPN were very entertaining and well done, and even the ones on topics I'm not particularly interested in were enjoyable. It has videos on a great variety of sports. These are a great value, and the shipping was quick.Overall: A perfect gift for a sports fan, although most anyone will enjoy."
5,Awesome Stuff...,"The more I hear of these concerts, the more impressed I get. With all the excitement the crowd generates, you wouldn't think this was a classical presentation. There's an energy that you would expect from a rock concert.I never really enjoyed waltzs before I started to listen to these. I might have to start getting the DVD's because the scenes of Vienna mesh really well with the music."
2,Bad Dog! Bad Author!,"I thought it was ok, like other reviews said. For a free book (buy 3 or 4 of under $10 books, get one free), I can live with it. And some of the stories are head-shakers (""I can't believe this.""). But if I had paid $10 out-of-pocket for it, I would be annoyed. Some of the stories are pretty cute; actually got a smile out of me. But I agree that the writing in 1st person from the POV of the dog can be pretty annoying."
4,A Howling good time!,"This book is a fun romp of stories of dogs being dogs and having fun. If you have ever owned a dog or puppy it is a must read, and for all you dogs out there it has some great ideas! I know, my dog Guinness is in the book!"
5,Outstanding BBC Editions of DIckens Classics,"These particular Dickens versions by the BBC are the best. Little Dorrit is our family favorite, though Oliver Twist runs a close second. The performances, sets, dialogue - all draw you into Dickens storybook world."
1,Very Stupid!!!!,I couldn't finish either of these!! They were sooo stupid.. The characters in Oliver Twist were very unbelievable and just stupid and Little Dorit wasn't much better... I didn't even finish the first episode of Oliver Twist!!! I thought Little Dorit sounded really cute but I was VERY disappointed... When I started watching it I was so bored I never finished the whole series.. Maybe it was gonna get better but it wasn't worth keeping to find out!!! Wouldn't recommend these to anyone!!!!!
5,From a french enthusiast of Pease's books,"Only 6 Pease's books where translated in french, but I have them all and admire the way he can suggest and make you dream. I would like to find his works in english to compare translations, and intend to write an article on him in a french magazine. Any reader who has a book of Pease for sale must contact me, or if you see one in store from a bookseller near your place, please tell me. I already have some titles in english, but I'm just begining : it's hard to find and expensive ! I can give any informations about his works translated in french. Thanks for every tip."
4,Outstanding read for teens and young adults,"I have nothing but the best memories of the wonderful Tod Moran books. They are very hard to find, but worth it. Pease presented a realistic view of life on a tramp steamer and wound interesting mysteries and adventure into this unique environment."
4,Jinx Ship,"Jinx Ship is not my favorite Howard Pease book. I recently bought a copy because it was the only one that I could find by the author at that time. They are no longer available in librarys. However, I read, and re-read all of Pease's books through Jr. High School and High School. They were an important influence on my life. Even though it was not possible to find employment on a ship, I was the first woman diesel mechanic employed by a well-known marine diesel repair station in Seattle. I learned integrity, courage and a love of reading and learning from Tod Moran and Captain Jarvis. If you leave your Howard Pease books laying around, your daughters and grand daughters may read them also!"
4,Jinx Ship,"I grew up in a Maritime Background and had dreams of going to sea and love reading Books by Howard Pease. The Jinx Ship was great being that I lived about 2 hours from N.Y.C. where the Voyage begins. I admired Tod Moran and wanted to be like him. Due to being Colored Blind, I couldnt be a Deck Officer or Engineer, so I became a Radio Officer ""Sparks"", after my time in the Coast Guard. I served on one Freighter and then worked at a shore station. When I reported to the SS Asean Promoter/S6EF be a Radio Officer in Mobile, Al. I arrived at Midnight, and felt like I was in a Howard Pease book. We sailed at 5:30 a.m. bound for Sept Isles, Quebec, I was 24 and was thinking of the numerous books by H. Pease I had read. Howard Pease gives such great descriptive details of the ships and the geography, and always felt like I knew Tod Moran, Capt. Jarvis, and Toppy personally. They were regular Characters in most of his books."
5,My favorite author as a child.,"Howard Pease was my favorite author as a child. I read most of his books during the 1960s, but I have heard nothing of the author or his books since then. It is only the existence of amazon.com, that made me try - almost as a lark - to try to locate books by this author."
1,What in the world?,"I have always had a profound interest in the history of American labor and particularly, the struggles that have taken place over time in labor. However, this book did absolutely nothing to add to my knowledge on the subject or even inspire me to read more about the themes within the book itself. I was extremely disappointed with the editor and his lack of understanding and attention to true detail. Perhaps the better title of this book would be, ""Myths and Legends of U.S. Labor in the 20th Century."" This is certainly not a history text of any kind. If I wanted to read radical fiction, I could have read a ""Star Trek"" book or something like that."
2,"Vaguely Intertesting book, horrible editing","I am a historian and find this topic to be extremly fascinating and important in US history. However, this book came up EXTREMELY short. The topic was poorly covered and the book was an extremly boreing read, even for a nonfiction history study. Also John Hinshaws editing left a lot to be desired. This could be one of the worst jobs of editing I have seen in my 40 years as a professor of history."
3,Oh how memories deceive us...,"Only reason this gets three stars is that it came quickly and in great condition but, unlike i remember, what a terrible cartoon.."
3,Helpful product,"I used this product with my GED Preparation class one time. Although it had some helpful information, most of my students found that the presentation style of the presenter was not engaging."
3,"Average film, not quite what I thought","This film has little to do with the ""Emmanuelle"" series. The acting is ok, the young lady in the title role was ok, but didn't really display much. I liked the original film better."
2,Not what I was expecting!,"Ordered this book to replace a copy that my daughter had. Looked the same, but the pictures/ story is different and there is only ONE pop up! The one she had had a pop up on every page...oh well."
3,Wizard of Oz clock,"Beautiful, detailed item but the clock would not work once it was placed into the holder. As it was a gift, I was not happy but the recipient did not care, just wanted it as a momento."
5,very nice,I went on line for all our bathroom hardware. The selection was great. I am very happy with these faucets. The brushed nickel does show some water spots but if wiped of when wet they are not hard to keep looking nice.
5,Stanlena,I have worked so hard to match the bathroom light and this faucet. It is not put together yet I have had to remodel my bathroom from top to bottom. Thank you Amazon. Do you know where Ican get a single Tiffany light for the bathroom in brushed nickel.?????
3,Hard to clean,"Replaced old faucets in three bathroom sinks with these faucets. Work fine, look good and quality is OK, however bonnet cover does not fit flesh down on counter. Water and crud is constantly getting under them making very hard to clean. Just something to consider before buying."
4,Kohler Faucet,"We love the look of the faucet. It's simple and classic and the brushed nickel is our go to choice now for finishes. My only issue with this faucet is the aerator, which we will be changing. The aerator that came with the faucet is splashy and gets the back of the counter wet w/o even putting anything under the stream of water."
1,Cold handle broke after very light use,"So disappointed! This faucet is in a bathroom that gets used perhaps once every 2-3 days. Cold handle got stuck multiple times, which I was able to loosen with WD 40. After a couple rounds of stuckness, it snapped so it doesn't work and the whole fixture must be replaced."
5,My daughter looks so cute in this hat,Very good hat for protection from the evil villain the sun trying to poison our children with its rays. LOL It's cute and our daughter loves wearing it which is a big plus so it must be comfortable.
4,Keeps the sun out,Great for keeping the sun of out of my kids face. It's a great fit the the tie helps the hat stay on. Washed easy and does not wrinkle.
4,Cute hat.,"I only got to use this hat once. Due to the heat baby wasn't outside to much. It fit ok, a little big for a newborn and the strap keep sliding over my little guys face. I think it would have been better if he was a little older. It did keep the sun off his face and neck though."
5,"soft,protective, perfect!","This hat has been very useful for my two year old (head on smaller side, but hat should last her several months). The material is very comfortable, she doesnt mind the under chin tie. The brim is wide and protective but not floppy and does not obscure her vision. I dont mind white as it is reflective and the hat is easy enough to wash."
2,"Good material, but not enough sun coverage","My daughter is 7 months old. Her head is on the bigger side and has plump cheeks. This sun hat is not able to efficiently cover her face unless I pull the hat very low on her face (covering her eyes with the head part) just to cover her cheeks. I love this hat and it does provide some sun coverage, but not completely."
4,A Nice Blend,"Take a teaspoon of Clarke, a pinch of Clancy, and dash of LeClarre and you get David Kagan. He uses a nice blend of science fact and fiction then adds some politics and high tech thrills, and gets one very good story. Although he is not at the level, yet, as the authors already mentioned, he does have some talent. Even though he does strech certain aspects, the doomsday weapon (as if there are not enough already) for example and has a tendency to stereo type the characters, he was still able to convince me that the whole situation was/is possible. The idea of a Solar Energy satillite has been thought of for sure (so claims the book) and it would not suprise me that the Oil Consortium would prevent its use. The use of raising tensions between the US and Russia, as used in the book, was/is not all that suprising either. I look forward to reading more of his books."
4,Beyond the Clapping Mountains,This was a favorite book of our family. We lived in Newfoundland in the early 1950's and this book was circulated among our friends. I think we wore out the original. The stories are told about artic animals and each brings a moral.A book for children of all ages.
1,Not worth it,"I would not recommend this book. I live in Kuwait now and all my friends told me to throw it a way (so I did)It is a waste of money, I am glad it was unexpensive but still a dissappointment."
3,High-living for gerbils,"I bought this ""duplex"" for the two gerbils my kids own. It'll give you a chuckle when you open it up and assemble it. It's great entertainment for gerbils and their owners. However, it's a struggle to put together and a major battle to clean, and you have to be gentle with it, too much force and it'll bust, since it's mostly made of plastic. I don't recommend giving it to children six and under. Most kids that age want to touch, feel and explore, and will definitely be banging the cage, spinning the wheel at extreme speeds with the gerbils inside."
4,"Beautiful first half, silly second...","This CD consists of 6 demo tracks by the NRPS when Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, and Phil Lesh were in the group. The second half is David Nelson goofing around. The demos (4 from November 1969 and 2 from July 1968) feature some of Garcia's richest pedal steel playing, especially on ""All I Ever Wanted."" This recording of ""Superman"" is much different than that which later showed up on the Gypsy Cowboy LP (out of print---an outrage to music lovers). The backward tracks are still entertaining if you like weird stuff and have a sense of humor, but get it for the demos!"
1,Nasty little movie - deserves minus 5 stars,I had to push the eject about 2/3 way thru. An ugly persona playing a no body in a who cares plot about trying to scalp tickets for the Pope's visit to NYC. If it wasn't for the girlfriend who dumped him - there'd be no one to watch at all. It's not funny. It's not romantic. It's just a waste of money and supposedly talanted people. It got 1 star because they don't do minus.
3,Why would she care?,"He's a devil-may-care scammer without a future. She has a lot going for her, a superb talent in the kitchen; She needs him like a hole in the head.Suspend all belief and enjoy."
1,Since when was scalping a big crime?,"In the movie, scalping was made out like it was a big crime. It's not"
4,She sings great in english but magnificent in french,"It is great to hear the english words to the songs you have heard her sing magnificently in french, she does a marvelous job of them and it is worth getting but her best singing is in french."
5,"edith piaf, Hymes of love.","This english version of Edith Piaf's songs is fabulous. I have always enjoyed her in her native tongue, but being able to understands the words fully just makes the music that much more passionate. turniper"
4,Hymn to Love of Edith Piaf,"One cannot listen to Piaf without wanting to sing along. If you don't speak French, this is the CD for you. Great driving music at the end of the workday."
4,"A good story about ballet, growing up, and family issues.","This book is about two sisters, Delia and her older sister Pearl. Their mother died when Pearl was very young. While Pearl is still having trouble dealing with the death of her mother, their father deals with it by avoiding talking about her, and Delia dives into ballet. Her new teacher is very strict and warns all her girls about being fat. While Delia gets better at dance, she also starts to starve herself and does nothing but dance. Pearl meanwhile withdraws from her family becoming rebellious and failing school. This story is as much about dance as it is about the survival of a broken family. This is a very good book that slightly older children will enjoy and even learn from. I recommend it to all who like books about ballet, dealing with family issues and growing into an adult."
5,Unable to Escape Your Past,"The Fence (1994)Starring Billy Wirth as Griff put in jail at 15 for defending his mother from an abusive father. Locked away his youth is wasted in the correctional system. Given a chance to be paroled, with a close inmate who has become a father figure to him (Paul Benjamin). When an overdose kills his mentor Griff gets out in the real world, a place where he has never been in 18 years. He tries to bring comfort to the family and becomes involved with the sister in law. (Erica Gimpel.)Hoping to have a normal life and love for the first time in his life only to have inmates from his pass show up along with a parole officer who is crooked.He is doomed the minute he leaves prison. I felt it is the best work Mr. Wirth has done. The childlike expressions to seeing a baby for the first time, just the look on his face as air blows by, finding love and someone to care for him... just to get taken down and destroyed."
4,sad story,My daughter bought this because she loves the the main actor and she has watched it many times i watched it with her once it was a simple enjoyable story and very sad at the end
5,So tragic!,So tragic - we must pay of our mistake but not this price.I think that this movie is drama and not thiriller or detective like lot think
3,Disappointed,"I was really hoping this movie would be good because I love Billy Wirth and his work. I have to admit I was disappointed in the whole movie. While the acting wasn't bad, I just didn't get the sense that things mattered as much to people as they should have. The love affair between Billy's character and the sister-in-law wasn't developed nearly enough. I just didn't feel for these people like I wanted to. In my opinion, not enough attention was paid to character development."
1,It Sucks!,"I Was Told It Would Work With My La Cross Weather Station, Well It Does Not Work.I Will Never But Anything From La Cross Again."
5,Listen to creed,"If anyone takes the time to listen to creed's lyrics, you may begin to understand the meaning behind them. It is BLATANLY, UNDENIABLY, a true depiction of the ups and downs of one's life. It represents feelings of hardship, love, fear, and confusion that we experience throughout our lives. It's about relationships and coming to terms with ourselves and life's circumnstances. It is not to be misintepreted by someone that has not 'listened' to creed, but has catagorized them into a genre in which they do not belong."
4,Good value for the money,"I bought this machine for my mother. It's easy to use and we had no problems with it at all. For those who are new to sewing, the instruction booklet is fairly easy to follow."
3,NICE OVERVIEW...but,"Great song selection, but too many of the best songs are the ""edited"" or ""single"" versions on here.We get the edited version of ""Nightbirds"" and ""Easier said than done""??WHAT?Their best songs should be in their FULL long versions....no exceptions.Reeno"
1,It floats but the lid won't last,"I live in Central Texas and go through one of these floating chlorinators every 8-10 months. The lids shatter from the intense heat but the manufacturer doesn't sell the lids by themselves. I've seen these advertised as, ""Heavy Duty"". Trust me, they are more like, ""Light Duty""."
3,A Little More Than Necessary,"This book promised to inspire the reader to desire greater knowledge about God, and at times did so. But the book is rather dull and tedious to read. Mr. Whites arguments are vary indepth and insightful. His use of scripture is excellent and I would recommend this book as a reference. But I would only recommend the first half of the book for casual readers."
2,What is the purpose of this book?,"Much of my reaction to this book has already been anticipated by other reviewers. In short, I can't figure out why this book was written. It lacks the thoroughness of White's very good book, Is the Mormon My Brother?, and so is useless to the apologist. On the other hand, it's too detailed in many places to be accessible to the average pew-sitter. It seems as if Mr. White couldn't decide what audience he was trying to reach. The sad result is an awkward amalgamation of breezy explanation and in-depth exegesis.There are far better books explaining and defending the Trinity out there - both for scholars and lay alike. Spend your money on them."
2,Not what I was expecting,"Based on Mr. White's earlier work ""King James Only..."" and his web site, I was expecting a rather detailed, logical, and all encompassing look at a defense of the Trinity. Surprisingly, this work doesn't appear to be any of the above. I've been waiting for this book to come out ever since I heard the author mention it on the Bible Answer Man show nearly a year ago. Suffice it to say that I am vastly dissappointed."
5,Excellent Text Book,"This is not just a nice little book about the Trinity; rather, it is a very solid exposition of the doctrine of the Trinity that will help any and all to better understand the One true God. It is a sad reality that many people within the Christian church don't have a clue that this is a vital topic. This is not a peripheral issue that is open to debate. The doctrine of the Trinity establishes the orthodox Godhead, and Dr. White does an exemplary job in explaining this doctrine in an easy-to-understand way for all."
1,Waiting for Prof. Whitebread,"As noted by other reviewers, the book is short, and I would add, as useless as it is brief. Wait until the author appears at your school to get a free copy. Spend your money on ""Getting to Maybe"" or taking the excellent LEEWS exam short-course. You may know the law, but without the ability to express it in the expected format in an organized manner at warp speed, you will find many doors closed to you forever. You will hear Whitebread's truisms a hundred times, but there is too little specificity here to help your performance."
4,Professor Whitebread - Exam Test Tips,"Professor Whitebread's book is easy to understand and digest. Unlike many other law books on how to achieve success in law school, Professor Whitebread's commentary and test taking tips (including the practice examinations in the back chapters) are written with absolute clarity. Moreover, his common sense approach to succesful examinations takes the enigma out of law school test taking. I would recommend this book highly to law students as a primer for practical law school examination tips."
5,Great tips,"Working FT and attending law school PT, I am SO glad I attended the lecture the Dean put on using a video of Professor Whitebread during which he explained the tips in this little book. Working FT, I didn't have as much time to study as I needed, so imagine my surprise when grades posted (I did much better than I expected, but that seems to be pretty normal.) If you get a chance to see the video lecture, don't miss it. Prof Whitebread's advice is dead on."
1,Useless,"This book does little more than expound the IRAC system, which will get you killed on exams. A much, much better book to get is ""Getting to Maybe."" Don't waste your time or money on this worthless waste of paper and ink."
1,Right-Wing Evangelist Propaganda,"As a devout Christian, I must say that this is by far the worst book I have ever read about ANYTHING! It does nothing more than chastise those with different beliefs, which is, by far, the must distorted view of the Bible possible. Propaganda for people who do not think for themselves and do not understand the real meaning of the Bible."
3,These are the Blisters,"Apparently this is what Columbia Records calls ""jazz"" in the post-Marsalis era. These three guys play ""acoustic"" instruments (piano, bass and drums) but they are more inspired by Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Liberace, and Iron Maiden than they are by, say, the Bill Evans Trio or Keith Jarrett. They are bombastic, melodramatic, overblown and sometimes entertaining in a theatrical sort of way. It's very difficult to take them seriously as jazz artists, which is where you will find this in your neighborhood record store if you even have one anymore, or go to one. I guess I'd put it in the Classical section, under ""Percussion"". Approach with caution, and be on the lookout for flying shrapnel."
2,Dull after the first listen,"This might seem exciting at first, but when it come down to it, there's very little content behind this band's bravado and image. Even the name of the band seems to be shoving their 'coolness' down your throat. And that's just what the music is like, when actually, they're just not that good. This disc is at best dull, and at times it's quite messy and annoying.If you really want to hear a piano trio that pushes out the boundaries of what's possible with that set-up, check out anything by Hiromi. Hiromi's stuff really puts this lame effort in its place."
1,artistically and technically inferior,"I'm a big fan of jazz fusion, and I can't enough of Metheny, Scofield, Frisell, Jarrett, Corea, Mehldau, and others. So I was elated when I heard about this new trio that was doing jazz-rock fusion. I went and bought this CD expecting great things from these newcomers.Unfortunately, while the concept is great, the problem is that these musicians suck. Horribly. No, I'm not joking. Their playing demonstrates a complete lack of depth. I've heard high school level musicians that sound better than this. They can't improvise, the harmonizations are ridiculously flat (and it sounds more like through incompetence rather than actual artistic intent), and technically they barely demonstrate their ability to actually play. In short, these players are just very, very bad."
5,It is what it is,"A lot of folks seem to be really upset that this is called a jazz album, and yet it doesn't mesh with their definition of ""jazz"". With over 30 years of musical performances under my belt, it never ceases to amaze me how much people can get hung up on labels. I could fit it into several categories. Jazz definitely. Rock, probably. Fusion, probably not. Disco (Heart of Glass)? possibly, but not likely.Fact is, this is an album that demonstrates some wonderfully inventive playing. Their technique may not have a glossy polished finish on it, but it's not lacking.Straining to come up with an analogy, I'd liken this album to a solid Ford F150 pickup truck. Some people won't like it cause they prefer Chevy. Others will complain that it doesn't have leather seats and a genuine wood veneer instrument panel. But it's great at what it sets out to do. (OK, it's a lame analogy. I'll try for something better later.)"
5,"Dynamic, forward-looking jazz","Brilliant players, superb originals and covers, intensity and passion and smarts on every track. Less jam-oriented and more pure jazz than Medeski, Martin & Woods, this is a group to pay attention to."
4,Awesome Renditions but Lacks Originality,"I love everything that The Bad Plus has done on this album. I had never even thought of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" as a jazz tune before hearing this, but hearing The Bad Plus's rendition of this song makes a lot of since. After hearing Flim, I went and got Aphex Twin's CD ""Come to Daddy EP"". I think that The Bad Plus is an excellent combo, and they are very tight. I love listening to them, however I feel that they are not living up to their complete potential with this album. The solos are simply not as breathtaking as they should be!"
4,Jazz album of the year.,"I first learned of this title as a bridge between solid traditional jazz and avant garde experimentation, recommended to patrons of Brad Mehldau, Dave Douglas, and Bill Frisell.This album is so infectious, and truly substantiates the following revelation: that a pop music staple (Blondie, Aphex Twin, and Nirvana selections) interpreted, deconstructed, and recreated into dynamic jazz madness amounts to some friggin sweet aural goods.Overall, there's no doubt these cats can play (speed, dexterity, rhythm, range, chops, composition, et al) but it is the refreshing, foreward-thinking, and accessible quality that I treasure so much! The material on this ingenious CD effort could make even the staunchiest jazz apathetic give up the love. Natch."
4,Transcendent Jazz,"With unparralleled rivals, Bad Plus stormed the scene, or i should say made it...The edginess acts like Medeski, Martin, and Wood were trying to implement to help bridge the gap between old school jazz traditionalists and new age freeform hipsters was burst wide open on this debut album displaying a sick amount of coiled terror of talent...While the cover songs were, as usual, exploited to shock and awe it's listeners, the originals displayed the sort of schizophrenic genius that you pray they will continue to wake up with.."
1,To try hard and then fail; The Bad Plus.,"I saw the Bad plus in 2004 on the North sea jazz festival.Why i decided to watch them was the positive reviews of the band. But that all suddenly changed that evening. ""Woodstock"" an other reviewer on this site, explains it very clearly: The band has high ideals but lack in technique. And that wouldn t be a problem if you decided to play a nice popsong but if you dicide to experiment with Jazz you have to be good in playing th piano. The errors they made playing that evening were Bad and there was no plus at all. I am sorry but if you re looking for a good jazz trio than buy EST s album ""Strange place for snow"", or any other album of the band. Don t wast your money on the Bad plus!"
3,Against The Hype,"I bought The Bad Plus based solely on the many, many positive reviews I'd read in the press (and here on Amazon). And I gotta' be honest -- It's just okay. I do not *yet* hear brilliance and ground-breaking innovation in these tracks. Certainly not when I spin any Brad Mehldau release right next to it. I'll keep spinning this disc for awhile if only because I want to believe in all the critics and jazz fans who've given it so many props. But, for now, I remain unconvinced."
2,nice watch - poor quality,Great looking watch and comfortable to wear but filled with condensation the first time I wore it for a swim. Only Swiss Army can repair it and when I contacted them they said it would take 6-8 weeks! Needs to be sent to Ohio. Fairly disappointing from a brand as reputable as Swiss Army.
2,Disappointed customer,I was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/DVD's. This one was disappointing as you don't feel like you did a workout. I like the older ones better with Tammy.
1,Disappointing! So 80's!!,I bought this dvd after seeing a recommendation by a celeb in a fitness magazine. Bad idea. I have several fitness dvd's from various outlets and this is the worst ever. Tamilee even gets confused telling you 4 more - oops 6 more when counting reps. It is formatted for vcr not dvd. It is not inspiring or motivating. Your money is better spent with other products.
2,"Leisa Hart is better in the ""STEEL"" videos than Tammylee","i really try and like this lady tammylee but she is not ideal for a woman like me to try and look like, her booty is too round and seems like she has a big booty complex....she has some great moves and does some fun work, but Leisa Hart, the instuctor on several other ""STEEL"" videos seems more enjoyable and likable...nothing against Tammilee, but this video set didn't do it for me."
5,Just what the cover tells you,"I like this DVD for the targeted workout in short sessions.I do it after a major cardio workout (running, biking or doing Tae-Bo), as 15 minutes is a right amount of time to make sure the troubled areas get extra attention. Even if I have just 30 mins in the morning before work, I would do 100 jumping jacks, some push-ups and one of abs/buns segments. If I am not slacking, I feel the results the next day (especially the 3rd buns workout, and I use a pot instead of a step), all it takes is to really squeeze every muscle I work on.The DVD has 3 abs and 3 buns sessions, with very short warm-up segments which I never skip. The menu is easy to navigate, and there is no blah-blah/credits/ads, straight to the workout.Good DVD to diversify workout routine, but I suggest using after a warm-up / cardio."
2,Disappointing,"The ab portion of the DVD is good, although I fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether. The buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set. The last one is a step-type exercise so if you don't have something you can step up on, you can't do it. The DVD itself is not very professionally done. Tamilee miscounts, doesn't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words. Abs of steel maybe, buns of steel, no way."
3,Okay video,"This video isn't too bad. I was a little dispointed. I think the abs part is better than the buns. There are two things that bother me about this tape. The first is that many of the workout routines require a good balancing abilty. I would prefer to just worry about the workout instead of thinking about having to balance. The second annoyance I have is that several times throughout the workout, she says ""one more"" or ""last one"" and then will do 3 or 4 more reps. It is a great ab workout, but as I said, the buns part is disapointing"
5,awesome ab workout,This is one of the best ab workouts I've ever tried. You really feel the burn without hurting your back. The movements seem so small but really pack a punch.
3,Too Much Tamilee,"Although Tamilee is enthusiastic, the camera occasionally seemed too focused on Tamilee's cleavage and crotch. Also, the overall instruction seemed a bit vague at times. The style is more ""bouncy"" than I would like."
5,Can't beat Tami Lee Webb for 15 minute workouts that get results!,"Fabulous price for the entire quick toning series on DVD. I have the VHS which I paid over $50 for in 1996. I used to do thighs and arms 3 times a week to keep my back and upper body in shape to work as an RN on the critical care unit. (patients were unconscious and lots of lifting and turning.) You cannot beat the results you get from her quick toning, 15 minute workouts that anyone can do at home."
1,Creepshow Blu-ray spec's dissapointing,"If WB think they can get away with stereo sound and a trailer, forget it.Universal UK released a loaded special edition sd-dvd featuring a DD5.1 track and a whole host of extras, including Romero/Savini running commentary, making of docu with many of the cast interviewed, behind the scenes footage from Tom Savini's own archives, trailer and still gallery.It's expected this SE will make it to BD at some point.WB step up your game with this forthcoming BD or forget it."
3,Shameful,"Simply put, Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves. A classic horror film like Creepshow sees the glory of Blu ray, but the package is awful! A trailer. Is that all you could come up with? Or is is all you cared to put into it? The 2-disc European DVD is fantastic, and beats this minimal effort blu ray in all but picture."
4,A fine tribute to the E.C. Comics line of the 50's.,What George Romero's Creepshow lacks in scares it definitely makes up for in style. The whole production faithfully recreates the feel and look of those old EC Comics that were all the rage is the 1950's. The all-star cast does a fine job portraying the luckless inhabitants of the old-school tales and the effective (although sometimes laughable) effects are brought to life by Tom Savini. Co-writen by Stephen King (who also has a starring role) this film serves dual purposes as an effective piece of horror and a great piece of nostalgia.
3,"Stephen King IS an OUTSTANDING , AMAZING writer !","For all of you that say "" This book is not worth reading "" or , "" This book is pathetic and barely tolerable "", YOU'RE WRONG ! I would like to say that this is not one of his best books but it is very enjoyable . I would not critisize such a writer , it takes intelligence to scare someone with something you've written . When I read books by Mr. King , It's better than watching any movie or going anywhere because you make the people what you want them to be , look like , a movie in your head . I think everyone of his books are worth reading . I think everyone of his books are AMAZING !!!!!! SO THERE CRITICAL PEOPLE . Have a nice day (smile) END"
3,SO ITS NOT THE BEST HORROR FILM AROUND....SO WHAT?,"Okay, Romero has done better with Dawn and Day, but lets look at how pathetic this movie is. The Tazmanian Devil in the crate...HA HA HA..That costume could be found on some person at a costume ball. Next we have the totally funny Meteor Fuzz on Stephen King. Terrible and yet so funny. Then we have ""Wheres my cake Bedilia""...That zombie coming out of the ground was hilariously un-scary. Then theres my favorite one with Leslie Nielson and Ted Danson...I laughed my ass off at this one....So funny and childish.....HA HA HA HA HA...Next time, dont look at the positives or the negatives, look in between. Its truly a funny film."
5,Remind me to get the insect repellent!,"Well, considering it's the month of Halloween, I figure I better catch up on my horror reviews. ""Creepshow"" is an anthology movie from the genius minds of both Stephen King and George Romero, containing several horror-comedy episodes, all at around 20 minutes or so. To this day, such an idea hasn't been done that often, and considering how novel it was at the time it was made, Romero and King pull this off very well. All the stories are entertaining and chilling, and the last one, if you have insectophobia, will be quite a shocker! For a fun and chilling way to spend your Friday night, enter the Creepshow! Thanks for the time, and peace."
4,IN THE TRADITION OF EC COMICS,This movie is an anthology that has stories similar to the stories found in the EC comic books of the 1950s. The five stories include plenty of murder and mayhem with elements of horror and scifi. highly reccommended
4,"A classic in screen ""Style"".","An outstanding cast in a group of horror stories that will make your skin crawl. A genuine example of the best in film style. Really captures the spirit of the old comic books with great graphics and editing. The E.G. Marshall episode with the roaches is for strong stomachs, but it is a delicious satire. A really ""fun"" movie!"
5,I LOVE THE CRYPT KEEPER!,This movie was one that started the whole Crypt Keeper fad. You can't be a true horror fan and not own these movies. I was so excited to get my copy!
3,Creepshow,"Remember watching it growing up and thinking it wasn't that scary and even less so now,but still a fun film. I don't follow What it's based on(comics) but I do like the movie, You have A goofy Stephen King,a serious Leslie Nielsen,Adrienne Barbeau..The one story that sticks out in my mind is ""Where's my Cake!!..."" Ah!... Sometimes it's funny, and then the Leslie Nielsen/Ted Danson story. It's a Classic even if cheesy and zany."
3,it has its charm,"What can you say about this movie? It isn't the best movie King has written, not by far. Romero has given us better films--Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead. It has bad animation. Bad effects (even though I am a Savini fan). Bad acting, though we get a young Ed Harris and Leslie Nielsen does put in a surprisingly good performance. And it has those annoying comic book frames within frames. There is a lot to hate about this film. But it does have a certain charm to it. Ted Danson helpless and not so suave or in control. A gruesomeness to it. King plays the hokey hick very well. You can't help but to like this movie, bad as it is."
3,Lack of Subtitles,"Creepshow is a true classic horror movie, but the lack of spanish subtitles makes the movie useless for my friends, not everyone speaks english in my house and the producers should consider this as a standard feature for all the movies.Carlos"
1,What does this have in common with Tales From The Crypt?,"Both feature little tales mixing horror with comedy. Both were written by famous writers and directors. Both presented good actors playing the characters. What does both don't have in common? Creepshow is bad but Tales From The Crypt don't. I feel like I was cheated by the cover, title and the [garbage] lines written in front an back of the cover. If you're looking for intelligent horror comedy, featuring different kinds of morals, look elsewhere, better yet, go watch Tales From The Crypt. Watching Creepshow you will feel really dumb because the tales don't have a meaning at all. You don't need to own it just because you're a Stephen King fan (like me), do yourself a favor and read his books instead. 0 stars!"
4,You will have nightmares.,"This film is essentially 4 stories woven to create equally frightening tales in true comic book format. Stephen King's brilliance shines in all four tales of murder, tragedy, love, betrayel and desperation. ""Father's Day"" still gives me the creeps. ""Meteor Man"" will leave you questioning yourself. ""The Sea Lovers"" will frighten you. Enjoy."
5,CREEPSHOW IS MY FAVORITE,"I would go into a long out review,but just go to my website.my entire site is dedicated to CREEPSHOW my favorite movie of ALLTIME!!!!And Romero and King my two favorite Horror masters!heres the"
2,Amateur,"By today's standards, this movie doesn't hold up. The quality is amateur. The acting is atrocious. Adrienne Barbeau for example was over the top in her portrayal of Wilma ""Billy"". ""The Crate"" didn't make any sense. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Cheesy Horror film to Enjoy.,"Very funny horror flick which contains 5 tales of horror. All of them were pretty interesting except for father's day, which was waiting to absolutely stink. I dont know if I blame his daughter ( you have to watch it to understand what I am talking about). My favorite was the 5th story They are Creeping on You, where this wealthy penthouse owner pays the price with bugs. He got tore off something awful. Anyway check this film out if you never seen it. It will give you the creeps.......a little anyway."
3,This is a landmark flick for horror,"I usually don't like comedy mixed with horror, but this is a tongue in cheek masterpiece! The Crate is a great story, as is the rest. The 2 stories this flick could have done without are The Lonely Death of some hick and Theyre Creeping Up On You. Both boring stories. This is a must! I hate Stephen King, but when George Romero and Stephen King combine, be sure to see it! hehehe"
3,Creepshow (Snap Case),"Creepshow (Snap Case) is a very uneven horror movies anthology which is a homage to 50's horror comics. Leslie Nielsen is amazing in his role as a demented killer in the segment called ""Something to tide you over"". The special effetcs are quite good and the music is very effective. My favourite segments are ""Fathers day"" and ""Something to tide you over"". I found the ""The crate"" and ""The lonely death of Jordy Verril"" to be ok. The last segment ""They're creeping up on you"" was not so good and could have been replaced with something else. Overall this is an entertaining movie anthology and I give it 3/5. 3/5."
2,"Which came first, Creepshow or Tales from the Crypt?","Five short stories that come from a boy's haunted comic book, which are all are ridiculous and boring. This movie was supposed to be funny, and I guess it is. It is so pathetic that you just have to laugh at how hopeless it is."
5,one of my al-time favorites,"i loved this movie. it was great with original stories, and by my favorite author, too. it was directed by one of my favorite directors, grorge romero.[night of the living dead, the crazies]. the dvd contains a trailer, and scene selections."
5,More great viewing,I truly love the Creepshow 1 and 2 dvds. Although a little dated they are still a lot of fun for a night of creepy entertainment.
4,A classic on Blu-Ray,"All I can say is that Creepshow is a classic and got it's due on Blu-Ray.The picture was great for a 25 plus year old film, and I hope that Blu-Ray keeps releasing them."
5,Some dark comedy,"I know Creepshow is intended as a horror movie, but for the most part, I couldn't helpbut laugh; especially during the scenes where Stephen King plays a simple farmer that becomes infected by an alien mold. If you love Tales from the Crypt, you will loves this movie, if only for the dark comedy."
4,creepshow blu-ray,Solid horror comedy from the 80's. The Blu-Ray has very good faithful picture quality and audio is likewise. To bad that the only extra was the theatrical trailer. A couple of interviews/appreciation or some sort of retrospect would have been nice./Roddo
3,Crappy Director. Good Writer.,"That crappy director George A. Romero, partners up with writer Stephan King to create fun semi-fright fest.It's a movie composed of many shorts movies. One involving a zombie after his father's day cake. Another involvig a meteor and a lonely guy(which seems to be the same idea that ""Evolution"" had). A story about a man getting some revenge against a few of his enemies. A story about a monster-filled crate, and a story about a man and cockroaches.All them pretty funny. Had a few moments that would make you jump, but overall, it was only good. Did not find it very exciting, but I was sitting at a wierd angle when I saw it, so I don't know. If I was looking head on it might have been different.By the way. It's not very scary."
3,Campy.,"I watched this after not seeing it for probably 30 years, when I was about 10. Of course, not as good as then, nor scary at all, and very campy. From a nostalgia perspective, good to watch. Certainly not really scary."
4,Great horror movie.,"A collection of Stephen Kings stories I believe, And he does not dissapoint. You get animals in crates that kill, Zombies coming back from the ocean. Fathers day suprises (wink) , and other things on par with Tales From The Crypt. If you love horror, you'll love this."
2,Great Film....TERRIBLE Transfer,"This is a great movie. It's fun. It's original. And best of all, it's quite demented!Every story, with the exception of ""The Lonsesome Death of Jordy Verill"" is fantastic. I won't waste my time reviewing each of the stories, because, let's face it...Anybody that's read or seen a Stephen King book or movie knows that it's gonna be a fun ride.Instead, this review is dedicated to the poor transfer of ""Creepshow"" to DVD. In a nutshell, it is simply one of the worst transfers I have EVER seen! The picture wobbles like an ill positioned film projector! A caption on the box SHOULD read: ""Watching this may cause motion sickness....Do NOT watch while operating heavy machinery."" Unfortunately, due to copyright laws, I cannot return a movie that I have already opened for a refund. I guess I'll probably stash this piece of garbage in ""The Crate"" under the stairs."
3,You are now exiting THE TWILIGHT ZONE,"As a father deprives his son of a nasty comic book, we get the chance to see the stories play out into a series of little skits (that add up to at least 2 hours total, little nothing!). The usual elements: A corpse coming back from the grave, a tale of revenge, some pesky bugs, a monster killing off people at a college campus, a meteor lands and bad things happen. One of the most original of it's kind with the comic book slice animation and odd red mixed with blue lighting that makes for an entertaining (and funny) movie. King himself stars in the second skit and this is not the last King movie we see Marshall in."
1,1 of 5,"Stephen King is in this show. He plays a retard, an appropriate metaphor considering he also wrote the screenplay. It's a comic book anthology of five relatively short stories that are supposed to be scary, or at-least spine-tingling creepy, but instead come across as just plain bad. Forget the horrible acting and laughable visual effects. The plots themselves; created by King at his hackiest, yes, but directed by the same George Romero who brought us the classic Night Of The Living Dead; are about as stupid as it gets. Attend this one at your own risk.marcellee.com"
5,A great underrated voice made for great soul,"With just one moderately charting hit back in 1987, Norwood (born Norwood Young, 1964, in Trenton, New Jersey), pretty much went under before most people really even knew who he was. A shame too, because he's a great singer. Whether he's crooning on the shimmery ballad ""Should Have Been Us Together,"" or being energetic on the funky ""Lady In Love,"" Norwood's strong, gritty voice, which is somewhat reminiscent of John White (another obscure 80s soul balladier who should have been much bigger than he was), injects this set of slick, well-produced set of poppy soul with an energy and passion that only so many male soul balladiers of the mid/late 80s could muster. He resurfaced with an all new album in 2008, which I can't comment on since I haven't heard it, but since he's still only in his 40s, I imagine that he's probably retained a good amount of what he had back in '87."
5,Greatest Rap CD Ever.,All the songs on this CD are great. DSU is hardly known among rap fans. It's too bad that these guys retired from rapping. At least I think so according to the last track. It would of been great if they were still rap artist and the world would of known them.
5,Have you tried turning it off and back on again?,"As the wife of a ""standard nerd,"" my husband and I really appreciate the humor of IT crowd. My husband's office looks just like the basement full of vintage computers and nerdy posters. This would be a funny show in it's own right, but for the techies and those who love them this really tickles the funny bone."
5,Fabulous series!,"This is one of the funniest series you can ever see, especially if you work in IT. Highly recommend it! Make sure you buy all 3 videos."
4,Hit Their Stride,"From the very first episode of this season to the last, they really hit their comedic stride. I thought this season was more developed and funnier than the first. I like that Noel Fielding was featured a bit more and that we got to see the characters out side of the work place and of course hilarity ensues."
5,Best comedy I've seen in a long time!,"I have to admit that I have a sibling in the tech field, so I find the characters very endearing, but this show is so hilarious. I imagine some people would find it dry or not gritty enough, but if you are looking for comedy that finds humor in silly little things and good physical comedy, this is it. It probably does help to find the IT genre easy to mock even though it deserves much respect. The chemistry of the actors and the timing of the jokes are very funny. Give it a couple of episodes if it does not get you right away, it is so worth it!"
5,IT Crowd season 2 - 'The Work Outing',One of my favorite episodes! A couple of buddies and i wanted to watch this episode so i bought it up and watched right then
4,Good St. Louis history,"I found the first 100 or so pages the best. Afterwards, the book got a little boring and slower paced. This book takes some of the polish of the traditional image of the founders of the city."
4,love this little lamp,"Order 1, order 2 or 3! They are the nicest little night lights and may be adding other subtle and positive things to our lives. They are very pleasing, warm glowing lights and I love the way they look. May not be able to prove that they help allergies but I think so and it adds so much to the ambience of my bedroom that if only for that...they are special!"
1,Real bad. Do not buy this bag. BAD buy.,"Do NOT buy this bag. I bought this bag and within a month the zipper on the top flap came right off. The bottom 4 plastic pieces that are there for protection started pulling away from the bag causing the bottom to rip less than two months after I got this bag. The top flaps leather is ripping after two months. This is NOT leather and if it is than its really bad leather.Of the two clips that come down from the top flap and attach to the bag, there is one that comes apart right after I put on the bag.This back pack will not last more than a Semester. If you want a leather back pack then you will have to spend money for it. A Nylon back pack is by far better than this. I don't usually say something is bad if it is OK but I wrote this review because I think the public needs to know that this is NOT a good buy."
5,"Very Literate and funny, thin on plot","I enjoyed this shirt immensely. It reminded me of the movie Days of Wine and Roses with Jack Lemmon. Funny, moving, and yet with a brilliant cast, this shirt touched me like no other shirt I have purchased."
4,beautiful country ballads,"I did'nt know:so help me girl.Hearing this song on radio,I ve looked for this song on amazon.With this cd,I ve found out two other beautiful ballads:Home and ships that dont come in.With:Home and prop me up beside the juke box,Joe Diffie is also a honky tonk man."
5,John Cage biography,"I watch this whenever I am feeling sad, and it always brings a smile to my face. John Cage is a gem of a human being, an enlightened and joyful mind. I highly recommend this video."
4,shocking but True!,"I am a rape survivor and yes, it can lead to Telekinesis and anything else. Research shows the negitive side of rape that causes obesitiy, sleeping disorders, personality disorders and criminal characteristics in rape victims! So if she just became telekinetic, then that's great!"
2,"Good, but not great","Telekinesis is great and all, but wouldn't it be better if she could control bees or talk to fish or something? Or better yet, something completely new. Imagine this: She can totally control dumb people's minds...like a jedi...only she makes money from it...very non-jedi...and has a crazy cult following who will verbally berate anyone who attacks her. That would be awesome."
5,Keider is the next great genius of political comics,"Think a more foul-mouthed and angrier Oliphant. Having seen the entire online collection of The Pain, I must say that depending on the themes, the comics are hit and miss (the ""loser who never gets laid"" schtick is really old), but when Kreider does draw blood, the result is some of the most brilliant political satire I have ever seen. If you want intelligent, exceedingly sharp, unbelievably funny and, above all, brutally honest liberal satire, and don't mind a bit of foul language, then this book is an absolute must have. Ten points out of five."
4,Beware the power chewer!,"My aussies love these airdog toys. It took them a while to figure out how to dismantle one but now that they know, it doesn't matter what shape of toy I buy...they have it destroyed in minutes. This is not for a dismantling kind of dog."
5,Inside Alzheimer's,"This book is a heart-breaker but also a love story. My father recently died of Alzheimers. There is hope and healing when stories and pain are shared. That must have taken tremendous courage to document this downhill struggle with a seemed ""unhappy"" ending. God bless you."
2,Not the Book I was Expecting,"This paperback ""version"" looks more like a supplement to the hardcover edition rather than a paperback copy with the same materials. I am going to keep the item because I ordered it for a huge research project, but I recommend that Amazon move this product to another listing with a more clear description. This and the hardcover book are NOT the same title. Also, the most recent paperback was the seventh edition, where the hardcover is the eighth.The text itself is an industrial publication, and a bit hard to navigate with appendices in the middle of the book, and the photos are grainy black and whites. For almost a hundred dollars, even for a paperback this should be a better quality publication."
1,Sticker Shock,"Two thumbs down. The book is just okay. No worse -- but certainly no better -- than similar, very basic books on the subject. The drawback here is the price. It's ridiculously expensive. Part of the school textbook racket, I guess. The ""new"" edition is from 2008 and offers nothing new. If you're a student, or someone on a limited budget, do not buy this. There are plenty of better options available."
4,An Excellent Resource,"This is one textbook I actually enjoy reading! If you are interested in Young Adult literature, either from an educator's or a parental perspective, this book is a great place to learn more. Of course, being a textbook, there is a section on the history of the genre, but it's actually interesting. But the best feature of this book is the the Focus Boxes which list current titles with brief summaries as examples of each format and genre. Also useful is a chronological list of award-winning books which appears near the beginning of the book. This is one text I plan to keep, then replace with newer editions as they are published."
4,Useful for Middle/ High School Librarians,"I bought this book for a class in selecting YA literature. The book gives practical information but, some of the websites mentioned are no longer available."
1,Worthless addition to the catalogues,"Never can one find a worst account of the Boxer Rebellion. While it is true that most books on the subject, especially those written by western authors, are biased, this certainly is no better for it, too, is greatly biased. A worthless addition to the catalogues."
5,"Best Book on Hunting, Guns","This book is the best I've read on Guns, bullets, related to Hunting I've ever read.Simply a very Valuable source of great information.Highly recommended. Read it.Tom"
5,Dangerous-Game Rifles,Great Book! Easy reading. Very informative. Great history on the firearms and catridges.Highly recommended to anyone interested in dangerous game hunting!
4,love this book,"I really like this book. Its the one I keep coming back to. The second edition is even better than the first. If you want in depth coverage of all the classic calibres, gunmakers, plus good coverage of all the practicalities of owning and running a heavy rifle, this is a really good place to start. Get this one and ""Any Shot You Want"" by A square and you've got it covered I think. Thanks for a very enjoyable read."
4,Dangerous Game Rifles,"Very intelligently written book, learned lots about rifles and the types of bullets needed for this type of hunting. Wish there were more pictures of the fine rifles that were described in the book. I felt that the author was very well educated on the subject matter."
5,Top Shelf,"Wieland has done an excellent job with this book. It is a work deserving of high praise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in big-game or dangerous-game rifles. This book is, perhaps, the best history lesson regarding these wonderful rifles available to the average US reader.Cheers,Dr. Stephen W. Templar, Author: rexGunRexgun"
5,A Great Book has been Made Even Better,"Terri Wieland has outdone himself with this update to Dangerous Game Rifles. This is one of the best books ever written on the subject.This new updated version of Dangerous Game Rifles has improved the book considerably. The modern updated information is a welcome addition and is very helpful.I recommend this book to all big bore fans, dangerous game rifle aficionados, and to safari hunters. For further reading on dangerous game rifles and safari rifles I also recommend Safari Rifles 2 by Craig Boddington Safari Rifles 2 - Trade Edtion as well as (if you can forgive my slight bias) my own book, rexGun by Stephen TemplarRexgun.Good reading, good shooting and good hunting."
2,manic no way!,i cant balive it only won christmas epasoid from frist sires then to the dumb sonic underground show with the bigiest pest and wrold MANIC and the brattys princess SONIA i relly hate manic sonias not to go ethier but manic is sooooo anoying who ever said manic was cool is wrong he will bug you forever dont buy buy sonic x so you dont have to listian to manic
1,Take sonic underground out,this was no good expect for the frist epasoide but it had su on it to wich is the wrost part of all manic sucks in it dont buy it
4,Sonic Christmas Movie,My Son enjoys watching this movie. I have not watched it to provide a full review but based on my sons enjoyment it must be pretty good to watch for a young child.
3,Adventures of Sonic,This is mostly an old episode of sonic the hedghog and then 3 more episodes for sonic underground which are all in the second half
3,More SU than aosth,When i first got this dvd i thought that there would be aosth episodes not SU.So I wached the chrismas blast and I loved it.Then the SU episodes came on and I wachted one and immediatley turned it off after it was done.I would have given this a 5-star if it had come with satam or aosth episodes but since it doesnt only chrismas blast is worth wachting.
2,Not the best!,I spent quite a bit of time with this book as it was required for a class I was taking. It tends not to go into enough depth or have specific enough examples.
2,Quality of Thermoskin gloves,"Since we just received and started to use the Thermoskin Arthritic Gloves a few days ago, I can not evaluate their efficacity. However, I am disappointed by the workmanship. After just one day of using the gloves, the stitching started to unravel on several fingers. I doubt that they will last very long with that problem. We will use them until they fall apart and hopefully that will be long enough for us to evaluate their efficacity. On the positive side, they fit well and are comfortable."
5,Great product,"Used this to power a 1 TB WD Sata disk, Works great no issue so far. Excellent Value and Quick Shipping"
4,Portrait of a great ballplayer,"I wasn't expecting a documentary of such quality. Admittedly I didn't know much about the subject, but after 90 minutes I'll be paying more attention on my next visit to the Hall of Fame.Hank Greenberg paved the way for Jackie Robinson to make it into the majors. People today don't realize how much antisemitism existed in America before WWII. This movie shows how Hank overcame it with grace and dignity while building a stellar career. Makes today's baseball stars look pale in comparsion. Don't rewind or stop the movie until you see and hear ALL the credits- you'll miss a lot!"
2,WONT WORK ON NEWER COMPUTERS,"I'm giving this game only 2 stars because it did not work on my new mac HOWEVER I played this game for years when I was younger and it first came out. If you miraculously have an old enough computer that still functions, buy this game."
1,Did not work for my pc,"I have purchased this item for a good price but when i recieved it, i put it in my disk drive and nothing happened. It keeps giving me an error pop up. Obviously something is wrong with the disk. So as you can see ""you get what you pay for"""
5,Coffee Syrup,Butter Pecan is my favorite! I really enjoy my daily cup of coffee with this favor syrup. It eliminate the need for me to add sugar.
5,Got Parents? Read This!,"For anyone with parents -- living or passed on -- this book is a must read. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry butmost of all .. it will make understand that you are not alone.Your issues - good and bad - are not solely yours. Everyonehas parental issues and Dr. Atkins shows us how to live and loveour way through them! Not riddled with psychological mumbo jumbo Dr. Atkins speaks to the heart of the matter. From beinga child with parents to an adult parenting your parents, I'm OK guides you through survival! Beautifully written and the type of book that you refer back to often throughout your daily life."
4,Good product for the money,"We were pleased with the product and glad it was a direct replacement for one that was probably 20+ years old. The only problem was that the right side was damaged in shipping. Fortunately that side was hidden, so we kept it. Better padding in the package would make all the difference."
4,A good and easy undertandable book!,"Being about such a vaste theme, this book easily tells the most important parts of the history of architecture. Not much jargong, and well written overall!"
2,Eh...,"Have you ever had canned corned beef hash? Ever open it right up and just taste it right out of the can? This tastes like that.... Unheated, canned corned beef hash.... Without the hash part."
3,"OK, but output quality is questionable.","I have used this on an HDTV, so this rating is based on the quality of the component HD output and not on the VGA output.The good news is that it works and you can set and adjust the resolution and the picture color and other parameters. The only thing that did not work was the 480P output from the Nintendo Wii. The 480i output from the Wii have worked but with poor quality of 720p/1080i ouput compared to the 480P output without the vid2vgatv scaler.The output from other sources worked fine, although you might be disappointed especially if you had high expectations like I did. Even after adjusting the color, contrast, brightness ... etc., if you compare the output of the vid2vgatv output to a upscaling dvd player, there is a considrabel difference, the quality of the upscaling dvd player is way much better."
3,Actually 2 1/2 stars...,"This was my first novel by High Cave and it was a ""decent"" book. It had a different end of the world premise than most others, so I give it points for a unique storyline. However, it just didn't captivate me like most good horror novels.The characters were fleshed out fairly well and the plot moved smoothly along, so I guess I could classify it as an interesting read, but not great.Buy it but don't expect miracles. I don't want to come down too hard on the writer since he seems to have accomplished a lot with all the awards he has won. His novels on occult and witchcraft are much, much better."
1,"promising synopsis, but disappointing payoff","Everyone's glowing review prompted me to purchase and read this novel, but I was quickly surprized by how stereotypical every character was portrayed, and at how badly written it all was.Bed hopping, cheap twilight zone twist, even a ""super-drug"" that the majority of the population is now addicted to made this a silly R-rated Goosebumps knockoff.Sorry, Mr. Cave, but this stink bomb cleared the room at my house."
2,"KEPT MY INTEREST, BUT...","In the future cities have become violent wastelands. A band of people decide to get together and seek out a life deep within the woods where they can start their own peaceful community kinda like ""The Village"". The downside is that nature decides to take revenge on whoever offends her by creating giant forms of the surrounding wildlife to attack and disappear. It was an interesting read that kept me turning the pages waiting for the next attack, but by the end I had a strong feeling of disappointment. I can ignore the overly preachy message and laughable inconsistencies as long as there are some good and frequent attacks. Unfortunately there's only one first-hand animal attack (two sequences are just aftermaths) and one by a patch of possessed sand. Its not really a horror book and not really a sci-fi book. it's a hokey human nature/survival drama with minimal elements of sci-fi and horror. Not absolutely horrible, but one to pass up."
3,Not Bad,"This is the first book I've read by Mr. Cave. Even though it is predictible; I couldn't put it down. The writing is probably one of the most natural I have ever come across. Another for me is Nancy Kilpatrick's writing. The Dawning surprised me on how easy it was to read. I didn't find it boring or scary. But, it does make one think!"
4,Very Good Book,"Well for starters, it's not really scary. But it does keep you on the edge. It's really intresting and it's a page-turner. Somehow you feel that it's real and that it's possible that someday, mother earth would get angry and try to get even with us. It's scary and this should let us think twice about the things we humans do to her."
3,DON'T KILL THE THREE EYED FROG,"Hugh Cave must be a good writer..this is my first dose, and I found it to be a passable, if somewhat predictable, book. THE DAWNING takes place in some forseeable future when man has corrupted the earth so much, that it decides to strike back. A group of survivalists decide to go out and start all over, getting back to nature and away from its violence and waste. There's not a character who isn't derived from some other book, no scenario that can't be predicted and no fresh look at anything. It's not suspenseful enough to be scary and it's preachy and there's one character who keeps calling his wife ""love"" so much, it's saccharinic to say the least. A livelier pace may have helped, but if Cave is one of the grand masters of modern horror, this is not a book that showcases that talent."
3,EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING...perhaps,"An excellent plot for a novel: Man has abused the environment until our subjects are forced to move to a wilderness area in Canada to survive. The characters, in spite of a valiant effort on the author's part, are all shallow and one-dimensional. The good guys aren't that good, the bad guys aren't that bad, and I was left puzzled about what the catastrophe was that caused the breakdown in society. A society which has no governing authority, yet currency is still in use? Too many unanswered questions..."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I story that makes you think about the consequences of all mankinds, as well as, you own actions! I must read for horror, fantasy or sci-fi readers!"
2,The watch does not work,"I was happy when I received the watch, as it looked pretty. Then I found it did not work at all, and at first I thought it was out of battery. Therefore, I went to a local watch repair store to change the battery and shorten the watchband, which cost me 20 bucks. It did work at that time. But after several days it stopped working again. If I pull out and push the button, it may start to work for several minutes, then stop. Now I am trying to contact the seller for returning it back. Hope I could get the refund.This is a terrible experience. I wish I bought a new one from an exclusive shop instead of one which does not give you guarantee. Such a waste of time and emotions!"
3,cheap,Of the 200 cd cases 10 were damaged in shipping. Most of the damage were to the hinge tabs. The packaging may or may not have contributed to the issue. They were packed in a corrugated box within a corrugated box without padding.They take up half the space of regular jewel cases and have a place for a slim set of documents in the form of tabs in the clear cover. The plastic is brittle. The hinge tabs are prone to breakage. Also the clear covers do not hold up to rough handling.The cases are unsuitable for items that will be handled on a daily basis.The cases are adequate for archiving dvd or cd copies of backup data. They are NOT unbreakable or break resistant.If you are looking for inexpensive storage these are the cases for you.
3,"Minimal quality, many arrived damaged.","Even though the box showed no damage, probably 70 of the cases arrived damaged. Luckily I only needed 100, and the price is still OK for 130. The surviving cases didn't seem as rigid as other bargain cases I've gotten before. It served it's purpose, but I won't order these again. If you do get these, order more than you need!"
4,Good Jewel cases,These jewel cases have performed well for me. The cost per unit is very good and I would recommend them for bulk use.
3,Several broken cases,"I wasn't sure how to review this item--the items that weren't broken in-transit were fine--usable and exactly like those you buy at a Best Buy or Office Supplies store. I expect that 2-5 per hundred will be broken, but in my shipment it was over 25 units and I'm finding more as I use them. I will request a partial refund--I had already used too many of them to do a return. Not sure what the outcome will be...I would recommend the item, but would make the purchase in a smaller quantity--you'd have less of them hitting each other and they'd be packaged in a tighter manner and thus, less damage."
5,Great Deal!,"These are an EXCELLENT deal and well worth the money. Quality is equal to any other CD Jewel cases I have purchased in the past. Will buy my next supply from same vendor, for sure!"
4,one of the best songs of 1990,"good beat, good lyrics, fun to listen to the rapper weas mopreme shakur who was 2pac's stepbrother and was in his group thug life."
2,Not up to the usual Justine Dare standards,"As a fan of Dare, I bought this book expecting a great plot with a courageous hero and heroine. I got none of those things. The relationship between the hero and heroine was poorly developed, I felt nothing for any of the characters, the plot was far from riveting and I skipped most of the book just to get to the end to find out who the Angel was. The sub plot involving Detectives Garrison and Kelso and Garrison's ex-husband was much more interesting. It was just a disappointing book."
4,"Good, but not my favorite by J. Dare.","I usually love Ms. Dare's books, but this is not my favorite. Most of the book takes the reader in and out of a shelter for abused women. The action doesn't seem to pick up until the end.In my opinion, Lynn and Drew Garrison's story was more interesting. They were detectives involved in the case who happened to be divorced. But this was only a subplot. Too bad.Don't get me wrong--I still liked the book, just not 5 stars worth. My favorite J. Dare continues to be LORD OF THE STORM."
2,Simple,"My previous experience with a Justine Dare book (High Stakes) is what drew me to this newest book. However, I was quite disappointed by the plot and the characters. The book is described as ""contemporary romance,"" but the feeling between the two characters isn't especially strong, and the romance is minimal. There was a subplot between two divorced detectives that was actually more interesting than the main characters. The ""mystery"" was ... well, easy to figure out after reading the first chapter, so the book ended up being not as suspenseful as I had hoped. From reading two of Dare's books, I would say that her strength is as a mystery writer moreso than romance. I just wish the identity of the Avenger wasn't so easy to figure out, and that the two main characters - Alex and Regan - had spent more time getting to know one another. This wasn't a poorly written book, or even an uninvolving one, it was just pretty simple and made for time-wasting."
4,Good Quality Fun,"If you are looking for a fun way to waste 2 hrs this is a good movie that could have been great. The sticking point being some of the action sequences were so terrible they were laughable such as archers firing bolts that had no trajectory and velocity slow enough to bounce off jello but who cares it's fun! The cinematography and color quality was excellent however and the film does indeed appear to be a tv show / soap opera type of thing or something like you'd get with a history channel recreation, it's very sharp and detailed just had an ""odd"" feeling to it.. Worth the money I spent. fans of this genre can do much worse than this film.. Just wish I knew who the actors were ( no english translation for the credits, )"
3,Not impressed,"I felt a bit disappointed in this film I saw no fun in it and the action was lame, story line also got a little boring after awhile expected more in the quality of the fight scenes"
1,Not as advertised,"1-star rating because the product was not as advertised. The product I ordered was supposed to be leather; however, the product I received was vinyl. I don't know if it was because they purposely did a ""bait'n'switch"" or if it were an honest mistake on the part of their product support/product fulfillment but I am very disappointed with the product (if I wanted vinyl, I would have ordered vinyl, as there's nothing wrong with vinyl/plastic but I wanted leather and ordered leather but didn't receive what I ordered) and have already tossed it into the garbage and gone to a brick and mortar store to purchase a genuine leather product."
5,Love this Jr. Padfolio,"This padfolio is very convinient when you are on the go, I always keep it in my car for any sudden note.Leather is very nice and durable.Will recommend this product to anyone"
4,Handy Writing Padfolio,"This writing padfolio is just what I was looking for. I wanted something small, stylish, sturdy and leather bound for the inside car door pocket. It is just the right size and handy when needed to jot down notes. The inside has a pocket for receipts and other papers. There is also a place for business cards. The leather is very durable for everyday use. However, there is no suede lining as described. In addition, the pen loop is not located in the center of the fold. There is a separate one attached to the edge of the inside cover. This writing padfolio definitely satisfies my needs."
4,Did I already send in a review for this brush???,"In case I goofed, and didn't post a review: yea, buy it! Easy to clean, handles super-high heat no problem. They got this brush RIGHT. They should send me a second one for free for this plug! LOL! Really, it's a nice brush."
2,The book is superficial but might have promise.,"Terrorism by White is superficial and will only appeal to people who watch ""bad boys, bad boys, whatca goin do when they come for you."" It does have some promise though when it attempts to reach the underlying sources of terror such as those poignantly revealed by Oliverio in her research."
4,I felt uplifted listening to this CD! E O Tchan is Tops!,I'm an E'O Tchan fan. I love Brazilian music. Most of all though I love Afro-Brazilian music and I consider E'O Tchan one of the best bands of this type of music. Their music is loads of fun and energetic. Just the way I like it. I don't consider their music junk! I consider it spunk! If you love to dance and enjoy fun music then try this one and other E'O Tchan cd's. They aren't popular for nothing!
2,"Nice girls, but the music...","One of the most famous axe band in Brasil but the famous of the group cames from those dancers, they are the best of band. The music work like game where you imagine the girls."
1,A day to be forgotten,"The axe-music was nice and enjoyable until the day when this record was released. It spoilt everything. And, since then, every year they release a new record with pure junk music. If we can call it ""music"". So, don't waste your money !"
4,"got this one for a gift, I think baby liked it","it misses a part that would allow you to attach it to a string so that it doesn't fall on the floor all the time. other than that it is really cute and a little freaky, of course!"
2,Started out great...didn't last,"I bought this for my daughter's 6th birthday. We have had this CD player for less than 6 months. She loved it at first. Now it has stopped working. I was never dropped or anything like that. We tried changing batteries so many times, but to no avail. It does not work anymore...how disappointing!"
1,piece of junk,"I bought this from Toys R Us for our 9 year-old daughter for Christmas. It worked two days. We've replaced batteries. Every once in a while it will work for about 30 seconds, then will shut off completely. The CD's inside will continue to spin and never play. We've tried several CD's. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,i love it but,"Me super encanta esta serie. Lo unico malo de estos dvds esque no esta completa. Yo ya vi la serie completa y me la compre porque me gusto mucho, pero cuando la vi me di cuenta deque le hacia falta un buen tramo. Asi que por eso esque no le pongo 5 estrellas porke no esta completa."
4,A FASCINATING NOVEL,"GOONAN HAS WRITTEN A FASCINATING AND HAUNTINGNOVEL THAT DEALS WITH CLONING, TIME TRAVEL ANDLOST LOVE. I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE CHARCTER CALLED CEN AND HIS STORY WAS MOVING. THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE NOVEL WAS WHAT HAPPEN TO HIM? THE AUTHOR LEFT HIS FATE UP IN THE AIR."
2,A generic time-travel story (but in Hawaii!),"This book takes over a hundred pages before it even gets to the concept of time travel. Nobody does anything really interesting. Clones, yes. Nanotech, yes. Super-string theory, yes. They're dropped into the story like 'tech' filler in Star Trek by someone who spent lots of time reading through all of the latest hot concepts and wants to make sure they don't miss a one. I was very relieved to finish the book, because then I knew I wasn't missing something and the reviews on the back really were clueless.On the other hand, it's probably a great book if you've never read real science fiction."
3,A great start but not much there.,It started well then just went downhill. I got halfway through and then just skimmed the middle and read the last chapter. I apparently didn't miss much. A lot of SF seems to start well and end poorly. It's like they have great ideas but don't know where to take it.
5,Captivating and unique,"In ""The Bones of Time"" Ms. Goonan combines cutting edge science fiction with traditional Hawaiian culture in a suspenseful and captivating race against time itself. The pace of the novel will keep you glued to the page and the climax is as stunning as it is satisfying. One of the finest science fiction stories I have ever read."
2,Boring,"This book should have been a short story. I picked it up sight unseen, based on the strength of her short fiction. The first major red flag was that the book was covered with praise for her previous book but there was nothing about this book on the jacket. No blurbs, no teaser, nothing. About a third of the way into the book it was clear why. This book is over-written, confusing, and boring. A disappointment."
5,perfectly decadent,"This is the most perfectly balanced body butter I've ever tried. It has just a touch a shimmer, is creamy but not greasy, absorbs well but doesn't disappear and smells lovely but not overpowering. It is well worth the price."
4,On their way to the Grand Line,The Straw Hat pirates are back and burning a path through the East-Blue on their way to making Luffy the king of the pirates. This volume stops after the crew escapes from Lougetown.
2,COULD'VE OF BEEN SO MUCH BETTER....IF.....,"THEY COULD HAVE OMITTED THE PROFANITY AND DRUG SCENES..THAT WEREN'T NEEDED, NOT EVEN FOR REALISTIC PURPOSES, THIS COMEDY/DRAMA COULD HAVE BEEN MORE FUNNY, WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE , IF THEY CONCENTRATED ON THE WRITING. THE MOVIE STARS FLEX ALEXANDER AND KHALIL KAIN AS BROTHERS WHO DON'T GET ALONG, BUT INHERIT A GAS STATION AND GO THRU A SERIES OF EVENTS IN ORDER TO KEEP IT. SUPERMODEL TYSON BECKFORD ALSO IS FEATURED IN THE MOVIE PERIODICALLY, SURE HE'S GOOD EYE CANDY FOR THE LADIES, ALTHOUGH HE'S AMONGST NO DENZEL WASHINGTONS, HE SHOULD CONSIDER ACTING SCHOOL, IF ACTING IS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO DO. LADIES, IF YOU JUST LIKE TO WATCH HANDSOME GUYS PUMP GAS, GO FOR IT! AGAIN THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINING MINUS THE ELEMENTS THAT GAVE IT AN R -RATING, THUS RUINING WHAT COULD'VE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER."
2,it was aight,this film had alot of Promise but got caught up in some cliches&preditablity. but the Lady Preacher:Good LAwd that sista was Sho Nuff Fione.if my local Church had a Preacher that looked like that Lady I'd put my whole wallet into the Collection Plate. it was cool seeing the two Brothers coming together for there Mother in the end.
2,An Odd Diddy,"The story line is quirky. The illustrations, although cute with the innocent animals, are kind of creepy of Steel McSteal and his wolves. There are much better cute cuddly winter read-alouds out there. This isn't one of them."
1,New Book Falling apart,"I am very disappointed in the quality of the book I received! I have literally read 2 chapters of this new book and the pages are falling out of the binding. I have never had this happen before. The quality of the book is horrible, the print itself looks like it was taken to a cheap copy franchise. I am barely able to read some of the pages. This book honestly looks like it may be counterfeit! Once you open the book up, pictures look like they were copied on a cheap copy machine and any highlighted box in the book is not clear enough to actually read. So upset!"
2,Disappointed,"I have an old Swiss Army quartz chrono, called the Maverick. I love this watch and have always been impressed with how much quality it holds for such an inexpensive watch. The bracelet is heavy and solid, the crystal is saphire and nicely curved, and the face is brilliant white and crisp. Now on the this watch... I was greatly disappointed as soon as I picked it up out of the box. The bracelet feels cheap and light, as does the bezel and case. The pushers for the chrono... at first I thought it was broken because it wouldn't reset. Then I realized that you have to give the lower button an unusually HARD push for it to function, much harder than the top button and obviously not to spec for this watch. This leads me to believe that the quality control for this watch is poor. Doubt I'll buy another Swiss Army. I'll give this one to my nephew."
1,Very annoying,"The service IS VERY BAD, and I make my order on November 4, 2007, I took it as page by the watch and today is December 3 and still pending. It reached me my request and I do not have the answer because I had come"
1,It is a great disappointment,"I don't like what happened in the story at all. Like everyone else, I don't appreciate Lawrence Miles' interference in the Doctor's life. I read the review for this book and I agree with it 100%. This book is not for fans, especially me. I was heartbroken to hear that Gallifrey was destroyed at the end and with it the Doctor's complete history. I mean when will the Doctor's memory return? What if he accidentally runs into one of his old friends and the Doctor doesn't recognize or remember him/her. They're feelings would be hurt, deeply I might add. I mean it, this isn't right at all. With his memory taken away, it might as well end the entire Doctor Who series. I don't feel I'll be alright until the Doctor gets his memory back."
4,Seeing Red,"If you love Marvel Comics superheros,this DVD is a must!In different adventures Spider-Man and the Fantastic 4 team up with Daredevil.In the Spider-Man deries,Peter Parker is accused of a crime he didn't commit.His attorney is Matt Murdock-Daredevil's alter ego!The ""versus""part doesn't last long.Soon the team up to catch the Kingpin.Calling this DVD action-packed is an understatement!I like it because it has great Marvel heros and villains,storylines that keep you on the edge of you seat,and it shows blind people can see in ways we can't."
4,Spider-Man Teams Up With Daredevil!!!!!!!!,"It's a great animated film based on the ABC family animated series.Too bad it didn't have my two favirote villians of all time Kraven The Hunter and Venom.Anyway good film BAD title I have it on DVD it should be called Spider-Man:Enter The Daredevil becuase they only fight eachother for fifthteen seconds then they team up!The villians are Kingpin,Smythe,Dr.Landon,The Ultimate Spider-Slayer(Smyte),Richard Fisk the Kingpin's son and I hate this villian The Chamelon.Good movie Super BAD Title.As I said it should've been called Spider-Man:Enter The Daredevil."
3,the video is not new,Hey......is Spidey a liar? The video is already out in the Sins of the Father.....shame on Marvel for trying to trick us. The original is great but should not be sold as NEW.
1,why sell un watchable DVD?,This DVD is in my trash can again. My son was very disappointed when it was keep skipping due to too many scratches on the DVD.
3,It's a zip up hoody...,"For the price I guess it's worth it. The material was pretty thin, but the cost was too."
3,Engineering problems undercut musical values,The 2nd disc would not play on my recent SONY player or the Phillips. Performances semed okay. Maybe this copy is a fluke
1,Disk issues,Ordered this disk twice and both times the disks would not play. Disks appear to be from a different region code.
3,Title not entirely true to content,"A mostly interesting book with ideas for some fun magic but are these the ""Greatest"" secrets? I think not. In fact this is a pretty standard and not very detailed how to book of magic. The tricks are covered in many other books and in greater detail."
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"Explained many tricks, but many others were not addressed. Wish it could have been more comprehensive."
4,nice book of magic,"its really good,but it needs more pictures and better expernations. but lots of good tricks"
1,Bad News,"This book disrespects magic by focusing on exposure. It reveals tricks in a way that destroys the illusion for the audience. It does not explain how to present the magic effectively, being designed to sell books more than promote the art. This book is useless for magicians and disillusioning for the audience. Before you buy this book, ask yourself, ""Do I want to have the feeling of wonder I have for magic removed by crass explanations?"" If you want to learn about magic there are much better places than this."
4,Good beginner book,"I thought that this book was very good for the beginner. It gives good step by step instructions and is very readable. However, I was disappointed that it did not cover paper piecing/foundation piecing."
5,Great for the beginner,Quiltmaking for Beginners was the the resource I needed. I am a beginner Quilter and this book explained it all for me.
5,Just what I needed,"This convex indoor mirror works great for our purposes. We have a new puppy that we like to monitor in the next room. My husband thought I was joking when I said I wanted one of these to watch the pup with, but I ordered it and he is no longer laughing. Now we don't have to get up every 5 minutes to make sure the pup isn't eating the couch or anything else in the next room."
3,Not good for the use I intended.,"I wanted to be able to put this up in my dining room so that from my kitchen I could keep an eye on my kids in the living room. Don't try to use this for that! A convex mirror will make EVERYTHING smaller and I couldn't even spot my kids while squinting. A flat, round mirror would have worked much better. I imagine if you are using this outside to spot a car coming from around the corner that it will work just fine. :P"
5,Incredible Views,"I bought this for our crowded and awkward L-shaped drive way. It is tight and involves precise maneuvering.PROS:Beautiful, Clear, WIde angle viewingOutdoor proof: has already survived a wide array of conditions, including heavy rains and winds.CONS:None. I wish I bought a bigger one."
4,A Good General Consumer Book,"Before you spend money on any ""How To"" book , you need to ask yourself at what level of knowledge and expertise you're at. This book isn't bad for a novice wanting to put in a basic system. It does go through the myriad examples of sprinkler types and how efficient they are and the suitability for a particular application. But just like most fields, irrigation is evolving quickly as regards new materials, products and standards. Overall, I feel this book gives good solid information for a do - it - yourselfer. The author does a good job explaining the theories involved with building a home irrigation system. You can save a lot of money installing your own system. You can also cause a lot of damage doing it incorrectly. This book can give you a good idea whether you can tackle installing a system or not. Use this book along with careful planning, to know what questions to ask either a sprinkler supply distributor or to hire an irrigation contractor."
5,first album,here we go is the first us5 album. i love it.in germany it was publiced on 18th october 2005.us5 is the best boyband ever
4,"fit and work great, easy to install","It took me two tries to get one of the front pieces in but the rest went in fine. I was a little nervous bending the whole thing to wedge it in the window channel. But they went in perfectly.Pros:The shades wedge into place and fit my 2003 F150 SuperCrew perfectly. It lets me drop the window over one inch to vent the air during the day and try and beat the heat while still keeping the rain and dust out.When driving, the air doesn't rush in through the front windows as forcefully after getting deflected by the front shades. This gives a more gentle breeze in the cab but still plenty of air movement.Cons:It does partially block 15%-20% of the right mirror, which takes some getting used to. This isn't much of a problem during the day since you can see through the tent well but at night may be more of a problem. I don't think any other brand/model would be any different in this respect. Unless that section is cut off or made of clear plastic."
3,EGR 573121 WindowVisor,"I have an 02 Ford f150 supercrew with stock mirrors. When I put on the EGR 573121 WindowVisor I realized that passenger side visor obscures the mirror. Although its only an inch or so, it is quite annoying. Driver side is not a problem. Other than that the product arrived safely, on-time, and installed easily and only took minutes per window.This product would be great for Super duty's with towing mirrors."
4,Great buy,"I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them, the only downside is that there is no fly opening."
3,"Okay, but loosen over time","I enjoyed these briefs, they are a decent underwear. However, after 2 motnhs i noticed some slack in the material, and feel it no longer hugs me like it used to. IT occasionally rides up a bit high when seated for long periods of time, and can be uncomfortable when you stand up, requiring a readjustment. But overall, the comfort is good, second only to my other Calvin kleins, which are of different material that i forget right now. They are really good, keep there elasticity. If I do find them i will link in this review."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought these hoping that they could replace the Gripper Jams I used to love and that CK doesn't make anymore. They had good reviews and decided to take the plunge, but I'm disappointed with the purchase. They ride us as soon as you move, and it's not because I've washed them. I bought for pairs and they all do the same. They get two stars because the material is very comfortable and it indeed feels like you aren't wearing anything when they don't ride up. These would be perfect if they made a 9"" version."
2,Just so so,I was hoping the great fit as the cotton version of the boxer brief. This version stretches too much and seems to wear away within just a few washes. Pay more and get less value...seems to be the the purpose of this product. Sorry but true.
1,Looks Good,"If you want a thermometer that looks good this is it. However, if you want it to provide you with an accurate temperature you're out of luck."
1,No relief,"I've been suffering from migraines for years now and can't seem to find anything that helps other than a trip to the ER and shots of heavy duty meds that make me walk sideways. That's not possible being a navy wife with a husband who's always gone so I'm always trying to find new ways to get relief without the loopy feeling afterwards. I bought these patches because at this point I'm willing to try just about anything. They didn't work for me at all, but I do think they'd be great for fevers maybe."
2,There are better DVD's for dogs,"I'm not sure what the producers were thing when they made this DVD. The first segment of this DVD is of dogs and my dog found it very entertaining. Then comes the long walk down a path - my dog lost interest immediately. The rest of the DVD has some interesting (for my dog) segments, like the prairie dogs, goats and the final segment with a dog fetching a ball, but the rest of the show, including butterflies, ducks, and a couple of horses that do not move was a waste of time. Dogs like dogs! Mine loves the Dog Sitter II and Disney's Space Buddies DVD's (except for the part where the puppies wear space suits with helmets - scared the dickens out of him!)."
3,Bored after 5 minutes,"This dvd grabbed my dog's attention for about 5 minutes but then quickly lost interest. He hasn't gone back to it once since the first time i put it in. I think once a dog figures out it's not the real thing, the dvd is history. But I have to say it's been very relaxing for me to listen to as background noise. Great sounds of nature and the animals so decided to give it 3 stars only for my benefit."
5,Dog Video - While You Are Gone,"Bought this along the CD to play every other day. Only draw back is I have to have the TV where the dogs is but no big deal in my house. Does give a nice feel to the room when its playing, my dog will watch for awile then sleep and just listen to it. I recommend!"
3,DVD doesn't always play,"The DVD is a little scratched, so anytime I want to play it, I have to clean it off and try it a few times before it works. The DVD itself is great, my dog loves to watch it while we're away...or so I think!"
1,Disappointment,"Bought this for my 6 year old Portuguese Water Dog. So many birds - ho-hum.Think this may be a great little film for cats.I found it had very poor production values, not enough action."
3,Not Sure,"I received the product on time. I put the DVD on and my black labrador stared at the TV screen for the first minute, then she carried on chewing and playing for another 5 minutes, then she looked up again and stared for another 1 minute then went back to what she was doing. And that was the pattern throughout the DVD. However, to be fair it did not get the DVD to calm her down whilst we were out I got it just to see if it might entertain her. I would say the jury is still out on this one for me."
3,My dog was not interested,"It's difficult to rate a product like this, as dogs will not always like or respond to the same stimuli. The DVD was interesting and there were even moments it briefly caught my dogs attention. However, it failed to hold the attention of my dog, who is 12 months old and has a strong prey drive."
1,didn't do much,"I have a former puppy mill dog who is quiet as an angel when you are home, but as soon as you leave the house, she chews everything up. I used this CD twice and there was no effect. Actually, the second time, my dog didn't chew up anything in the living room, where the DVD was playing, but discovered the art of jumping up on my desk in my office upstairs and ripping apart books and papers. Maybe she was too relaxed in the living room so decided to go upstairs for a chewing session. Kidding. This DVD is a good idea, and I'm glad it worked for many others, but unfortunately, it didn't work for me. I'm going to try Through a Dog's Ear and some other products, like the DAP collar and Thundershirt."
2,"audio ok, visually no effect","Bought this items based on good reviews here.My mini schnauzer won't pay any attention to visual presentation (on my 40"" HDTV, so it's not bc of poor quality video), but audio keeps his ears flopping once in a while. So I just copied the audio files onto a cd and had it looping on my stereo for 8 hrs.Visual - no effectAudio - mediocre"
2,Not what I expected,"This DVD was not what I expected. It was just a video of birds, dogs, etc. My dogs barely looked at it."
3,Dog: No. Cat: Yes!,"I live in a highrise and feel guilty about leaving my dog home some days. I bought this DVD hoping it would keep her entertained. It did not. She briefly perked up her ears when there was a wolf howl, but that was it.My cat's attention, however, never waivered! (I'd been planning to buy a DVD for her but thought there was a better chance she would like the dog's DVD than vice versa.)"
1,Just leave your TV on,"This DVD really isn't worth the money. My dogs lost interest in seconds, not even minutes. If you want to show your dogs videos of animals while you are out, just tape something like a David Attenborough TV program and replay it while you are out...better still, take your videocam and have a fun day in the zoo... that's what this person did."
1,Don't buy this DVD!,"By the look of the cover it looks like a great DVD, but that's not the case. It's a cheaply made home video. My dog starts growling and viciously barking. It does not have the effect it says it will."
2,DVD for Dogs not so entertaining,"I bought this for my dog whom we have decided has A.D.D. (haha) Anyway, she does have a short attention span, and the scenes in this movie are a bit too long to hold her attention. They will interest her for about 10 seconds, maybe a little longer, but as each scene and sound stays there for a good 5-10 minutes, I ended up watching more than she did. Also, there weren't a lot of barking dogs (just the same one occasionally throughout the movie) and there weren't any scenes of dogs playing together or anything. I think that these would have held her attention far longer than the ducks, chickens, fish, etc..The movie is set up nicely, but for a dog with virtually no attention span, it didn't work out well."
2,Amature video,"This is an amateur video of weird, pseudo-classical music with animal scenes. My dogs show no preference to watching (which they dont) it or listening to the radio. Buy a bag of rawhides with your $10"
3,My dog really doesn't care for this DVD,"May work for some dogs since they are all different, but my dog really didn't care for this DVD. She would rather watch ""Lady & the Tramp""!"
2,What a waste of money...,This video is only one hour long and it's a montage of video clips that look like someone went out with a video camera and taped a bunch of stuff dogs might like. My dogs hated it. They kept wandering around the house wondering where the weird noises were coming from and whining. They did not watch the tv at all.
3,Not For the Novice Practitioner,"This powerful book written by a highly experiencd practitioner gives extensive background, details and thoughful reasons behind the practice of ""allegedly"" helping people to reconnect with parts of their psyche that are causing them grief or are simply no longer available to them. The puzzle is involving oneself in this activity and that we may not have access to all the reasons for the initial disconnect. The words ""better left alone"" resonant with these activities because of our own arrogance and lack of all the pertinant details essential to back bringing together that which is broken. Even the most carefully mended object still exhibits the signs of the mend. Tread carefully unless you REALLY know your stuff."
5,great introduction,"This book is a great introduction to soul retrieval from a core shamanic perspective. It reads easily and covers all the bases. I would be cautious, however, of having a soul retrieval done by anyone except a very experienced shaman. As one comment before stated, sometimes people are not ready and cannot contain the soul pieces they retrieve. An experienced shaman is able to intuit this and proceed accordingly in the best interest of the client."
3,OK for starting,"Not bad to read if you're new on the topic.A lot of stories that you can relate to, which is good. But not a lot of insight from this book."
5,a new favorite,"I started to read this book during a transitional, healing period in my life and it was just perfect. It addressed the very concepts that I was trying to figure out for myself . I feel its a new concept in our modern age but pulls at the heartstrings of every person. Almost feels like lost commonsense. I loved this book and will treasure this knowledge by applying it to my healing and I love Sandra , thank-you."
5,Powerfully thought provoking,"This literary work, which I gobbled up in just a few sittings, nourished a void in my spirit and was the catalyst that began my journey into the study of core shamanic practice. Sandra's documented work in the area of souls *lost and found* has inspired me to learn to negotiate the terraine of ordinary and non-ordinary reality. I highly recommend this book."
5,A great introduction and possible salvation,"This book found its way into my hands. I had no previous information concerning Shamanism or the practices there of. Upon reading this book I felt a new understanding of my own life and wanted to learn more. I found a Shaman who performed a soul retrieval for me. What Sandra Ingerman had written in this book prepared me for the experiences.As it happened, this book was the catapult into a new ""knowing"". I've since loaned this book to others, and still have a list of those yet to borrow it. My excitement about this book is comparable to ""salvation""! :)But, I would also interject here that this was my first introduction to Shamanism. Those already familiar with the practices might find this book trivial. If so, please keep in mind the usefulness it holds for ""beginners"" and that everyone must find their own doorway."
5,amazing stuff!!,I love Sandra Ingerman!! I have read several books on Shamanism and hers are the best in my opinion. She has a special energy which I can really relate to. So far I have read two of her books and they have completely inspired me in my journeys.
2,Purchase Villoldo's book instead,"If you are considering this book STOP! Better to buy Mending The Past & Healing The Future With Soul Retrieval by Alberto Villoldo. I bought both books at the same time. Sandra's was painful to read; I had to force myself to finish it. Sandra thinks she can do ""what no mere mortal can"". She tells you stories of healings; with no reference points or verifications. She could have made up every ""example"". Like a 1960's book before publishers required actual facts. Villoldo on the other hand explains in great detail the why, where and whens of ""soul retrieval"". Sorry Sandra, but the jig is up. Good luck and I think you need to go retrive that part of your sould that threw honesty out the window!"
5,an excellent review book,I found this review book an excellent source of knowledge and simple to understand. This book by passes all the intricate biochemical details and present the meat and potatoes so to speak. The wisdom of the pearls make this book unique. I recommend this book to any professional in a primary care setting.
5,Woodland Scenics,"I did not buy this product through Amazon, due to the cost of shipping. I did purchase this rock mold, at my local Model Railroad Hobby store. The quality of the rubber is very thick and sturdy. I use Woodland Scenics Lightweight Hydrocal, has the medium for creating the rocks. I own all of the Woodland Scenics Rock Molds. I suggest you keep them in an air-tight bag, with a light coat of talcum powder. Also make sure, you clean all the little crevices, before storing. The folks at Woodland Scenics are very friendly, and are available during normal business hours if you have any questions. These molds are made in the USA, and are not a cheap China Knock-Off. I do not work for this company, I am just a model GEEK, you can see my newbie work on youtube - ""wigwagworkshop"". I also suggest taking a look at their website [...]/ for other products. Just to be fair, the folks at Scenic Express [...] also have wonderful, made in the USA products."
2,Lith-Ease - Seams to Dry out...,"Use to be a great fan of Lith-Ease. After all, What makes the world go Round? Grease!I'll use a bit on most anything that moves, squeeks, or ever needs needs service(boat bearings, sewing machines, vaccuum cleaners, etc).However, Lith-Ease seams to dry out and dissapear much sooner than say, a good hi-temp multi-purpose grease.I've looked at door hinge lightly greased with lith-ease a year later and the white excess has gone hard and crumbly! Grease ist supposed to dry out and get crubbly! I gave up Lith-ease and dont use it anymore.A good hi-temp, waterproof, bearing grease (recommented for tuff stuff in bad environments like salt water boat trailer bearings, and usually Red in color) keeps your world running turning better..."
2,Lith-Ease White Lithium Grease by AGS stinky and not white,"I have used other brands of ""white lithium grease"" in the past on my fishing reels where I don't want any smell to spook the fish. AGS Lith-Ease white lithium grease has a strong industrial stinky odor, plus it's not very white... it's actually tan. On top of that, it runs and is not as thick as it should be. I need to go find another brand that doesn't smell and is actually white."
3,Its ok my girls didnt care for it maybe more for boys.,Might be a better cartoon for boys my girls watched it once and then didnt care to repeat and they usualy watch things multiple times.
1,not very good,my children were watching and getting into a little bit of sonice. this movie was werid and they had no idea whom inspector gadget was.
5,He loves it. A+,My grandson was a Super Hero fan but has changed his allegiance to Inspector Gadget. He plays it over and over and gives it gets 5 stars. Don Adams' voice on this one is wonderful!
4,Nostalgia,"This piece of instrument is a Conversion Piece in my living room. It exudes authority, a sense of discipline and nostalgia. To say anything less would be a dishonour."
4,"Going, Going, Gong","If you're looking for a gong with a traditional, deep, gong sound, this isn't the gong for you. However, despite its somewhat annoying tinny sound, it makes a good novelty gift and can add a unique Asian touch to your decor. This gong is not a toy so I wouldn't recommend you leave it alone with any children under 7 years old as they could break it and although you might love children, the noise (and children) will eventually get on your nerves."
1,Not what I expected,"This gong looks great, but sounds terrible. I bought it to use at a junior high school to reward students for their achievements on tests, however when it arrived on for the legs was loose and the screw was made of brass and stripped when I attempted to fix it. The sound that was posted with this gong must have been from a perfect example or another product. I can make the same sound using pans. I sent it back, Amazon was great with the return and purchased a Zildjian instead. If you are looking for a decorative piece, this gong is great, however if you want it to function spend more on a real gong."
4,gong,"I work as an administrator in a medical center reversing days denied by insurance companies. I hit the desk gong whenever I get a day reversed. It works well, is made solidly and gives my coworkers a laugh"
5,Great for the Desk!,My company hits the gong when we get an order over a certain amount. One location has a gigantic gong and we wanted to get a smaller desktop version for our other locations. We've now purchased three of these and our employees love it. It doesn't take up much room at all and has a nice sound.
4,Imperialism Up Close,"This book is an excellent general history of the American invasion and conquest of The Philippines in 1898-1902. The author immersed himself in private letters, official hearings, and newspaper editorials from the era. The result of this research is a compelling picture of a sleazy and violent episode in American history, when Republican politicians launched a war to boost their prospects in the 1898 midterm elections. The book is timelier than ever after 9/11, since imperialism has come back into vogue in the guise of anti-terrorism -- anyone who has illusions about America's ""innocence"" today should read Miller's accounts of atrocities and racism circa 1900.I gave the book four stars instead of five only because the narrative is based almost exclusively on U.S. sources. In particular, Miller's endless rehashing of imperialist and anti-imperialist newspaper editorials gets quite old at times."
3,Not a bad Score,"The film left much to be, well let's say... James Horner did the best with what dramatic film he had to work with. In all honesty Horner should not have taken this one on. His music is far beyond what the images of this film had expected to be. It's a shame."
3,At least it is on DVD,There is nothing wrong with this DVD. Only we have VHS Spot's that are much better than this and look forward to some of the older Spot's to be released on DVD. At least you get 2 shows.
5,Spot is addicting!,"This is actually my second time purchasing this video. I had the VHS tape, but it was quickly worn out by my nieces and nephews when they visited. Now that I have a 20-month-old of my own, I'm happy to have Spot on dvd. Seriously, out of the 8 children that I know that has seen this video, they have ALL sat transfixed to the screen. It's amazing because the video is very ""simplistic"" in nature, but maybe that's why it's so great for toddlers. The music is nice and soothing, the stories are easy to follow and the kids all have loved that it's about a puppy. I would recommend this to any new parent! (It's actually rather relaxing for adults, too!)"
2,An aquired taste,"OK. So I am way outside the Denver circuit and supremely unlikely to catch any live performances; as about unlikely as any Denver group would be to tour Alice Springs in Central Australia. But I am hooked on David Eugene Edward's purchase on the planet. Unsure of what contribution he made to this mid 90s phenomenon, I approached with caution, knowing that reviews citing The Band require due circumspection. I also get a laugh out of Slim Cessna's peculiarly dry religious references. Is this serious mid-west mockery? Whatever, Edwards sounds like a somewhat demented Believer; not sure about what in, but the music is believable, and he has, as it is sad,'found his voice'. Whoever is singing here(is it an adolescent Edwards?) with the Gentlemen does not. It sounds like David Surkamp(Pavlov's Dog) not quite attuned to a dadaist, Pere Ubu, but all a few notches below the achievements of any of these citations. Liked track four. But way short of requiring a revisit."
5,Very good shower,"I purchased a few showers before this one, more expensive ones (in the 25 - 30 range) and had to return them because they were either flimsy or the water flow was somewhat messed up.I gave this one a try and I could not believe that for $15 I got this quality of a product.Sure keep in mind that it is white, plain plastic. But more often than not, the beauty is in the simplicity of things.This is an excellent buy for the money and a shower that works just as a shower should.Definitely would recommend to friends"
2,ouch,"This thing hurts. Maybe okay to use on the bottoms of your feet, but to scrub on sensitive parts of your body?? Owwww."
3,"Good, but sythentic is better","I ordered this and a synthetic version with two different sides at the same time. I never use this one anymore, though it is a decent product."
4,"It does what it's supposed to do, but has a strong odor initially.","I purchased three of these items, one for personal use and two as gifts. They are as described and work well. However, they all had a strong odor of sisal. Even after washing briefly in the sink and a couple of uses in the shower, I still found it very noticeable. If you plan on using them as gifts in any way, consider first washing them thoroughly. On the plus side, they are great backscratchers!"
5,Cast aluminum lid prop for gas grill,"This cast aluminum grill lid prop is a MUST for anyone who grills. I props your lid open and keeps your grill from over heating, or hold it partially open if it is a windy day. I love this thing. I could not grill without it. I had one a few years back and stupidly gave it away to a friend who admired it. . I could not grill without it. So I purchased another one, and now I can grill expertly again. great product."
4,A delightful disc,"I first got to know the Rameau keyboard pieces in an odd way - via a synthesised version by Bob James, a sort of ""Switched-on Rameau"", but, to my ears, much superior to Walter/Wendy Carlos's effort with Bach. So, when I saw that the marvellous Angela Hewitt had recorded them, I bought the CD.Now this will not go down well with purists, because Jean-Philippe Rameau wrote them for the harpsichord, a very different instrument from the modern piano. However, Ms Hewitt does her usual great job, playing with all the virtuosity, sensibility and feeling that typifies her art. The pieces, while not being what one could really call ""great music"", are, by turns, bright, lively, contemplative - and all thoroughly enjoyable. My feeling is that, in the composers' Valhalla, Jean-Philippe is listening and saying, ""Formidable!"""
4,Rameau: Keyboard Suites,Angela Hewitt does a beautiful job interpreting these Rameau Suites. While Rameau tends toward much repetition his music is delightful to hear. Glad someone of Hewitt's talent has recorded some of his works.
5,ThinkPad T60,I am from India but bought it online and my US friend bought this laptop to India. Very sterdy model. I never had any heating problem due to high temperature outside. No problem like keybaord problem or dvd rom problem. Never!! Very good product.
4,Muppets Need Hats,"Fozzie Bear cannot go on stage and perform without his missing hat. Distraught, he sniffs, ""My hat and I-we were a team."" Not so far fetched a premise; can you imagine Charlie Chaplin without his Bowler?"
5,Works Like A Charm,"I really wanted a metal manual pasta machine, but was discouraged as I read details about other machines. I finally opted for the Atlas 150 - it was reasonably-priced, made in Italy, and had garnered positive reviews.I am posting because I want to tell you that this machine lived up to its billing. It is easy to use, convenient, and a cinch to clean. My wife (she's half Italian) and I previously made pasta by hand. Thanks to this machine, our process has been signficantly reduced. We are eating fresh pasta more frequently, and the pasta it produces--if working with a reliable recipe (which we do)--garners compliments at our dinner parties.I recommend that you have two people to work with the dough as you crank it through the machine. Trust me, it will make your life easier. Plus you can enjoy conversation and time spent with your partner.I bought this machine around Thanksgiving (2006). Absolutely no regrets. Highly recommended!"
1,Mercato Atlas 150 Poorly made,I purchased this pasta machine and wasn't even able to roll 1 sheet before the rollers stopped turning. Upon further inspecttion it doesn't appear to be assembled correctly. I had high hopes for this machine but was sorely dissappointed.
1,"Not a new one at all, with broken cutting roller","The seller stated it's brand new with defective box, so it price a bit less than the brand new one. However, one of the cutting roller was broken and it's stuck when I rolled it with the handle. I had to push very hard to make the roller moving. There were lots of flour on the surface of pasta maker as well, which looked like it had been used before. Had to pay for the return postage costs although it's seller fault. WOn't trust this seller( ToyNGamesEtc) again and suggest everyone else stay away from them."
1,Stainless Steel? What Part is Stainless Steel?,"I was ready to purchase this item, but from the manufacturer's description, no part of it is stainless steel. Seems rather false to me."
5,Marcato Atlas Wellness 150 Pasta Maker,"This pasta maker is well worth the price! I can make pasta that is delicious and healthy, using my own ingredients without worrying about preservatives and additives. The pasta maker is easy to assemble and use. Clean-up is quick as well. I recommend this product for those who are interested in making food from scratch!"
5,Atlas a Fitting Name,"As we all know, Atlas held up the world in his hands. I've looked for a pasta maker that will hold up making pasta for years. I didn't want junk. Can't beat stainless steel. Going to this web site helped me make my decision. Last week I ordered,today it came. I pulled it out of its' box and it was so simple I didnot need directions. I clamped it to my bread board and practiced with it. Put a piece of rubber back/shelf liner under it to keep from slipping. Tonight I will have pasta with grilled chicken. Waiting to see how the recipe of 2 Cups of flour, 1 egg and 1/3 c. water turns out. I think the stainless steel, Italian made pasta maker will last for many years. Simple, economical and made to last. Happy Pasta you all."
5,decent machine,"this thing works well. I use it for pasta and flatbread(chapotis).it is smaller than it looks on the picture. It has 9 settings but I willonly use the first 4 because I like thick pasta but it makes really thin sheets if you want ravioli or lasagna.The pasta cutters really work well too. Thin spaghetti is a breeze. Worth the money,65, dont spend more,its not necessary unless your commercial."
5,Great Pasta Machine,"This is the first pasta machine I have ever used, but I have worked as a Chef in fine dining restaurants for over ten years, so I know food products well. The pasta machine is well built and easy to use. I would say that any negative reviews are the result of user error, or possibly somebody getting a lemon. I have had the machine for over a month and made pasta almost one a week. I made pasta, ravioli (with a press, not the attachment), and lasagna noodles. Read the directions (even if the English is not perfect) and watch a handful of YouTube pasta videos and you will be all set. A lot depends on you making dough with a good consistency, so if things are sticking add some flour to the dough, or if it is not cutting the noodles all the way add some water, because the dough is too dry. Enjoy!"
5,Super Easy,"I have the attachment for the Kitchen-Aid stand mixer but the ""pasta"" it produces is fairly horrible. I kept seeing these devices used on Iron Chef America (like I did with the pressure cooker--great help, love it). My concern was that the dough would stick to the rollers and cutters. It will if you don't dust liberally with flour. Flour is your friend.I think Marcella Hazan said the Marcato doesn't produce thin enough pasta. You can see through the dough on 8 and it goes to 9 which results in your fingers going through the sheet of dough when you try to lift it. 9 is like turning it up to 11, I don't go there. I don't get what she's talking about.You can freeze half the dough for later. Just plan ahead a little and your life will be simplified by this sturdy, heavy, trouble-free pasta machine. Next I'm going to make wonton wrappers."
5,No need for an electric attachment,"This machine is awesome, and I honestly don't know how I did without it for so long!! I had been debating getting the electric attachment because some people say you need three hands. NOT SO. Making pasta with the hand crank is so easy, and there's no point to spending so much money on a silly hands-free electric device.I have made whole wheat pasta several times, and it's turned out perfectly. The key is to knead, knead, and knead the dough some more, then to cover it and let it rest for a little bit (like 1/2 an hour). If it's sticky it needs more flour, or it'll tear and not pass through the machine correctly. I do two cups of flour, two eggs, and enough water to form a cohesive dough. It's fabulous!"
3,paster maker,This pasta maker was not the quality I expected from the Atlas company. I purchased this for my daugher and the metal is cheap and the machine squeaks all the time. I have owned an Atlas pasta maker for over 30 years and I'm sorry to say that they do not make their product as durable today as they did several years ago.
4,"Fun, solid construction,","I know it is on the pricey side; but have used several times and made it a cool thing to do together. Wish it came with all the bells and whistles; like ravioli maker, drying rack (bought seperate) and some more recepes (in USA). Most are pertaining to Europe. Amazon shipped promptly and actually sent two; but credited me for my return without any hassle. Use your imagination and make all kinds of interesting flavors."
5,Why doesn't this thing cost 2x what they are charging!?!,"Great roller. I wouldn't have been shocked if I saw this at a store for two hundred dollars. High quality, good time with family...its a no brainer."
5,Love my pasta maker!,"The only complaint (if you could call it that) is that the attachment that screws to the counter is smaller than I thought and in order for it to fit, I have to open a kitchen drawer and screw it in to the underside of the counter with the drawer open. Other than that, this is a wonderful machine!"
5,FABULOUS!,"I just got this machine for my birthday and made a delicious batch of fettucini on my first try (I used 2 cups all purpose flour and 3 eggs in the food processor). I am very pleased with the quality of the machine. I had a cheapie version in the past and it didn't even compare. The directions that came with the machine are very simple and straightforward. I had no problems with the clamp and although it took a few tries to get the technique of rolling with one hand while guiding with the other, I eventually got it (that was after my 2 and 3 1/2 year old sons got tired of helping!). The pasta was amazing (no comparison to dried store-bought pasta)."
1,Horrible Packing,"Someone packed this Pasta Machine in a horrible box. The exterior box was damaged as well as the interior box. The knob which controls the pasta thickness was knocked off. I managed to pound this knob back on the machine, which works, but the machine is damaged."
5,Good pasta maker,"My husband wanted this for Christmas and is very happy with it. The pasta he made was very good, and he found it really easy to use."
5,Love this item,"After reading a lot of reviews I picked the Marcato Atlas Wellness 150. I couldn't wait to try making pasta. It was really easy to use. I used the recipe enclosed. Kneaded the dough and started to play. I was amazed at how easily I was able to put the dough thru the rollers and the cutters. I did it by myself. It held onto the counter without moving and I was able to crank and feed with out any trouble. I didn't have to add any extra flour or water. My only mess was a little crumble on my floor but it was dry crumbs and a little flour that swept up easily.Marcato Atlas Wellness 150 Pasta Maker, Stainless Steel"
5,Heavy duty authentic Italian pasta maker,I bought this machine after attending a pasta making class and this machine is fantastic! It's heavy-duty construction is appreciated during the pasta making process and the quality of an Italian-made machine comes through. It's easy to use and has been great for making all kinds of pasta. My recommendation is not to skimp and buy a cheaper non-Italian made machine. The quality and weight are worth the price.
2,not made to last,"One and half year ago, I purchased this item for my mom. It is very easy to use and my mom loves it very much. It saves lots of her time to make pasta for the whole family. She made so much pasta and froze them, so dinner is really quick with the ready to cook pasta in hands. Everyone of the family loves the pasta maker and I have suggested several friends to buy the same item from Amazon.However, after a year of using, it is BROKEN! The key part of it is made of something NOT steel! The rolling handle is stuck inside and can not get out. I checked it thoroughly and realized that the shape of the part that bears the most force has been changed after so many uses, so the handle can not be released. After one year use, it is impossible to return it. So now the pasta maker is sleeping in my cabinet."
5,What a great Christmas present this turned out to be,My husband loved this pasta maker and has already used it three times. He finds it easy to use. I reap the benefits.
3,Excellent machine but defected,"I never used pasta machine before. I was so excited to buy 2 machines for me and my mother. Turned out mine handle got stuck the first time i used it and couldnt take out until 1 hour later and the noodle making component was loose even tho i tried my best to fit it/ However, my mother's was perfect did not have any problem i had and she is very happy with it. I am currently sending mine back and get a replacement so hopefully the next one would be perfect"
2,Marcato Atlas Pasta Maker,"Received in good time. There is a part missing. The opening where the handle slides into in the first position, not the second or third position where you put the dough into to cut the pasta size. From the picture on the box there should be a plug in that hole so when the handle is inserted it holds firm when the machine is bolted down. I'm trying to find this part on line, so far no LUCK!"
5,"Solid, well priced, functional","I agree with the positive reviewers: this is a fine piece of machinery. I've had fun experimenting with recipes for the pasta itself.It disassembles into a box roughly the size of a teakettle. It stores in my pantry on the same shelf with my breakfast cereals and crackers.One tip: attach it to your ironing board!Another tip: buy the drying rack. Using a broomstick or oven rack isn't nearly as handy. The broomstick in particular either wouldn't hold as much pasta, and/or took up too much kitchen space while the pasta was drying.A fun kitchen tool."
5,This Pasta Roller is Great!!!,"This pasta machine is great, easy to figure out how to work it. Delivery on time. The pasta comes out perfect. Me and my husband love it. We are completely satisfied with the purchase. So don't be afraid to buy it.! Enjoy."
5,Fantastic piece of machinery,"I had never made pasta before purchasing the Atlas Original (Italy). After reading dozens of reviews on almost as many different pasta rolling machines, I finally decided to spend a little more than I wanted. Totally worth it. The first time I tried pasta making with this machine it came out perfectly! The Atlas is so easy to use. Smooth rolling operation... heavy solid stainless. The simple mechanics should last for generations. I feel that its quality build and hence longevity will more than justify its cost."
2,Nice while it worked,"I purchased this in July 2011 and it broke several months ago. Before that, we had some rocking pasta. Now thhe rollers no longer stay opposed when turning the crank. We never washed it with water or inserted anything between the rollers (other than pasta). The warranty is three years but since the company is in Italy I am not sure how to obtain service. The website luckily has an english translation but the first email I sent was returned as invalid domain. Luckily there was one other address. I will post an update once I hear or don't hear from them."
2,Maybe mine is defective?,"I bought the 150 based on the good reviews it got, but I am not so sure about this..When I try to make spaghetti, no matter how dry the dough, the cutter always leaves two strands stuck together. There doesn't seem to be any US based support, I emailed Marcato and did not get a response yet, I'm not sure if I got a lemon or what, has anyone else had this problem?"
5,People now think I am gourmet,"I LOVE this product. It really is a no brainer to use. It takes a few times to get the hang of it, but once you do it is smooth sailing. My trick to to keep it from moving, is put a dish cloth under the atlas, and wrap it underneath the table, and then then put the wrench thingy (No clue what its called) over that. The towel will give it the resistance and friction that it needs to stay in place.Fresh pasta tastes so much better than boxed pasta. I have been making mine with white spelt flour and its fantastic. ENJOY!"
2,Mine is defective,I was so excited to get my pasta machine. It worked great for flattening the pasta dough. But unfortunately the pasta cutter component did not work correctly. The gears kept catching when I was cutting my dough. I am sending back my Atlas and waiting for my replacement. Hope my second one is better. I am hesitant about this decision. But I have heard so many great things about Marcato that I decided to try again. Wish me luck!***UPDATE***I got my replacement. Works great! Returning it for a new one was no big deal. Of course I wasn't happy about it. One thing I have learned is to let the pasta dry a bit after making the flattened sheets; before using the cutters. It makes it much easier and they don't stick together that much. I now love my Atlas.
3,False advertising,Amazon advertises this Atlas pasta machine as made of stainless steel. The manufacturer's website confirms that the unit is made of other types of metal and coatings. No where on the product itself does it read stainless steel.
5,Pasta Pasta!,"This pasta maker is amazing! The instructions are very clear, and it makes delicious pasta. I have a feeling this machine will last me forever."
5,Cooking made fun!,"Just a little ditty, this is so easy and so much fun. 2 c all purpose floor, 3 eggs 40 sec in the food processor then you have your dough. let it sit for 15 min and push it through, clean up is easy, set up is easy, and figuring out is a breese. I've done it a few times now and it doesn't get old, I'm worried about gaining weight from eating more pasta. I suggest getting a good food processor along with the complete noodle book by America' Test Kitchen and you are instantly a wonderful Italian women, cooking away."
3,Novice Pasta-Maker Tool!,"Attempted making pasta last year with bountiful garden of basil. It turned out too thick no matter HOW many times I flattened it with my rolling pin. This little machine got it sooooooo thin and after cooking (which took NO TIME at ALL!) it felt like silk in my mouth! Every bit as delicious and better than dried pasta, as I was told it would be.Immediately ordered the ravioli attachment and it arrived just last week. We are eager to put our imagination and ravioli recipies to work!Only-est thing is it takes 2 to hold it onto our counter while turning the crank and feed the dough into the rollers. I wish it had a better ""grip""."
3,I think that it's okay,I have only tried this twice but it is okay. It doen't grip well and the cavettelli maker doesn't fit on rhe counter at all.
2,Ok for light doughs,"Under light use this machine is fine, but the rollers run on plastic bushings and after a few stiff doughs you won't be able to run it on settings 7, 8 or 9 as it will be more open on one side than the other causing your dough to bunch up and wrinkle in impossible to deal with ways. I'm currently looking for a machine with either real brass bushings or ball bearings. I think the old atlas's might have had brass because I've seen people who claim to have used them for 35 years and there is no way that the piece is crap I have lasted 25 years.I'd give it one star, but it does work ok for counter ornament."
2,Cheaply made.,After I bought this my GF found one at a local store for 20 bucks!!! After we used it twice the socket where the handle goes stripped... now it gets stuck all the time and I have to literally unscrew one side take it apart and put it back together to continue making my pasta. Not worth that much for sure!!
2,Why noodles often stuck in the slots? Any help would be great!,"noodles often stuck in the slot, that's the only problem, I think it's the rake's problem, the rake is supposed to flexible and snapping the slots, so noodles would be take out of the slots.I'm sure others have the same problem too, is there an alternative flexible rake? Any customer service I can use??"
5,Never going back tp store bought!,"This pasta maker was so much easier to use than I expected. The only downside is that you absolutely cannot wash this in water, and that left me feeling a bit concerned because the pasta has egg in it. BUT... if you make the dough correctly, cleaning is a cinch!"
5,"Great price, Great present!",My brother is a student at le cordon blue and wanted his own pasta maker. For his birthday I purchased this one and he was more than pleased. He also said that it was the same model they use at his school. I have tasted the pasta he made with it and watched the process. It was delicious. I would recommend this pasta maker to anyone who wants to make their own.
4,Used for paper art,"We use this pasta machine for paper art. Works great. We also have the 3 mm attachment; although it fits a bit tight in the mounting slots, it works well also."
5,Great pasta machine!,Excellent quality product that does exactly what it is meant to do! I am very happy I purchased this! I have found that this very easy to use. The clamp is strong and holds the unit to my cutting board so I can use this on my own. I can not wait to purchase some more attachments. This is also very easy to clean.
3,SQUANTO - by Disney,"I love watching Adam Beach and Eric Schweig do their acting stuff and they did it well considering this was a definite DISNEY flick in every way. I enjoyed the story even though it was a squeeky clean movie , but you have to expect that from Disney , especially back in the 90's.I think it's a good kid's flick and I even bought it for my Adam & Ericlibrary of VHS and DVD's. Yea, it might not be exactly historically correct , but the guys did an all around good job. And they ain't too bad to look at either!!! JK A & E ... no really...you guys are HOT!!! and still lookin' good today in 2007!!!!"
5,Excellent movie,I showed this dvd to my students for Native American month and Thanksgiving. They really enjoyed it! It teaches very good morals to them.
5,Adam Beach is a five star actor,"Whether or not this movie depicts true accounts of Sqanto's life, there is one truth that I must state....Adam Beach is a wonderful actor! His performance alone is worth watching this movie...which I also enjoyed. I hope to see more of this talented actor.Great Job Mr. Beach. Bravo!"
4,A Heartfelt Performance,This film is based on historical events and this where the inspiration for the tale originates. SQUANTO: A WARRIOR'S TALE is the stuff legends are made of. This is also a Disney film and aimed at family audiences. It contains all the elements to tell a fulfilling story and inspire one to seek out more concerning the actual events that it is based. The film's strength is in Adam Beach's performance. Adam Beach is Squanto. He gives a heartfelt sincere performance projecting all the virtuous qualities of his heritage. Beach projects a sense of nobility in the face of his adversaries that the viewer can admire and take inspiration.
2,"[Similarities: Dokken, Fair Warning, White Lion]","This is one of those releases that does zero for me. It'sbig riff filled Euro rock that sounds like it wants to be so manythings, yet winds up being none of them. Sure it has some decent moments, like the bouncy ""Heart On The Run"" or the big arena rocker ""Desperate Call"", but the rest is all ""by the numbers"" melodic rock that neither inspires nor leaves you with the feeling that you've accomplished anything for the 50 minutes you spent listening. C'mon, does anyone get excited over titles like ""Eyes Of A Stranger"", ""Going Crazy"" or ""Love Reaction"" anymore? Nicely played, nicely produced, now if they only had the songs to go with it..."
1,crown kept coming unscrewed,"I'm not real happy with my experience. The watch looks pretty nice, and I had another momentum watch I liked very much. This one, unfortunately, had the bad habit of its crown unscrewing. I would crank it down as tight as my fingers could get it, and low and behold, a few days later I would notice it had come completely unscrewed again. I should have warrantied it at this point, but I didn't get around to and of course it eventually ended up in the shower with an open crown. The watch came with a big warning card instructing me to ""check the crown every time the watch gets wet"", which makes me wonder if this might be a common problem. I don't think I should have to check my waterproof watch every time it gets wet. The stupid thing should just be waterproof."
4,FAST shipping a little mistake on refund,I got this book in no time.I needed it for a stats class I was taking in school and got it either the next day or two. I was happy with the service but when it came to my refund there was a slight delay. Bernie was kind enough to refund the full amount because it took over 2 weeks to get it. Usually for a refund it is less shipping and 10% restocking fee.
2,Very Displeased,I have had this book for two semsters at a grad level. The information is confusing and at times leaves one lost. I am very displeased with the book. It has not helped me in no way understanding the meaning behind behavioral stats. In fact I am more confused now. I wish the book could have given more details on explaining stats instead of so many examples. The examples are find but the problem is they are continued from the beginning of the book. And if one doesnot grasp the beginning then how can one grasp the remainer of the text. I wouldnot recommend this book to no one.E.T.
1,The Most Difficult Book in the World,"I'm not a literary reviewer or a writer, I'm just a third year Sociology student at the University of Windsor who is being forced to take a statistics course...and forced to use this text. It's bad enough that I have to take the course but, to go and dump on me, probably THE most difficult book in the world to read, is just too much. The definitions are uncomprehensible, the examples are useless and the explanations are so overly worded you can't even make out what the point is! On top of all that, the chapters aren't in any type of sensible order and as if all this wasn't enough....the darn thing costs well over $90 (for a book I will never use again!). In sum, the worst possible choice for a statistics course text and a complete waste of money!!!"
2,Riddled With Editing Errors,"Not only is this text a terrible read for anyone trying to learn statistics, it is riddled with inaccuracies. While that would be problematic enough in an English textbook, this is a math course for Pete's sake! They're numbers. If the formulas and results are inaccurate, how are students supposed to learn? The author literally brushes this off by saying, don't worry about the formulas, they're just there for reference. Furthermore, it's dense with useless prose and light on visuals which makes the process of learning statistics unbearable for the average student. I strongly recommend Research Methods and Statistics by Sherri Jackson instead to anyone who is sincere about learning this valuable field of information."
5,100%,Thank You Amazon!!!!!!!I have already told others to buy from this site...The book was in Excellent condition and it came Fast!!!Thanks for excellent service!!!!Peace=-)
3,Stats book review,"This is a pretty decent statistics book. It has few, if any, examples for each chapter. The questions at the end of each chapter, however, are written well and help you to understand the material a little better. I think it would be difficult if you were relying solely on this book and not an instructor to learn the material. But overall, it is a decently written school book."
5,Email Revlon,"This is a wonderful product that should have never been discontinued. If you go to Revlon's site at;[...] and let them know how much this product is missed...maybe they will bring it back. I hate to see a product that works so well...on younger and older faces...be discontinued. Come on girls & ladies, lets fight for this product."
5,Revlon Eye-Glide Eyeshadow Pen,"This is a fantastic product and can't believe Revlon have discontinued it! I'm constantly on the lookout for it and very pleased I found a supplier on Amazon. It's such an easy product to use, it really does 'glide-on'...lasts all day and the choice of different shades is fantastic. Love this product!!"
3,Engaging Crime Series,"Fredric Brown is one of the best Science Fiction writers, with O'Henry endings, humor, cynicism, with a hard driving plot. I guess his crime fiction has most of these characteristics, but it seems to have less bite. A nice read, but not special like his Sci-fi stuff."
2,Do not buy this set!,"When paying $60 for a set, you expect that the quality is going to be decent. This set is J-U-N-K!!! The cardboard box that you assemble is flimsy, and immensely difficult to assemble as it is continuously falling apart. This box is a big part of your tricks, so without it, most are pointless. After 1/2 an hour, my daughter who was thrilled to get it just wanted to return it. We bought it at a locally owned toy shop that has a no returns policy, so looks like it was $60 wasted."
3,DJ Vadim - U.S.S.R. The Art Of Listening,"More sparse hip-hop from DJ Vadim on U.S.S.R THE ART OF LISTENING. Even ""Till Suns In Your Eye"" announces its own abstraction to a laidback wobble of drug and alcohol references. Yarah Bravo offers her own woozy vocals to ""She Who is Tested"" into a beat medley with a thick double bass, and a delicate conscious rap to ""The Pacifist."" Elsewhere the Gift of Gab puts in his pitter-patter lyrics to the test on ""Combustible."" The jazz and vocal textures of ""Revelations Well Expounded"" add a strong bit of contrast to the rappers elsewhere, which makes it an ""The Harp Song"" stand out all the more. Similarly, the African singing throughout ""Too Fun Aiye"" or the Asian string plucking on ""The Correct Size"" gives those tracks unique textures. And you can't go wrong with TTC and their smooth French lyrics breaking and entering on ""L'art d'Ecouter."" A mixed bag, certainly, but still worth some spins."
3,The sound samples are more impressive than the CD really is.,"I bought this CD immediately after hearing the Amazon audio samples. What I thought I was getting was some really deep and complex tracks and a lot of different sounds. However, once the CD arrived, I was very disappointed with what I heard. There is just something monotonous and annoying about many of the tracks.This is one of those CD's where the tracks start out promising, and you expect it to explode into something awesome...however, that just doesn't happen - I just skip tracks until the disc is over.This CD just did not impress me, and if you, like me, was excited by the sound samples provided, you will probably be disappointed. I own a few hundred CD's, most of which are the similar style of music, and this is definitely towards the bottom of the pile now."
5,Great Looks,"I bought this watch a while ago and returned the first one because it didn't work right at least i didn't think so turns out I was wrong needed a little chrono schooling I liked it so much I got the same one.Amazon has just about the best price for it and it looks great! not too big on my wrist but doesn't look like a women's watch either.The chrono function works great now that I understand how to use em'(didn't think the watch stopped duh).This is now my favorite everyday watch now I do some outdoors stuff and definitely need a watch with a rotating bezel it doesn't have a tach but you can figure that stuff out pretty easy with the chrono feature or the bezel.Also the tenths of a second hand doesn't keep rotating during timing this threw me off too all of the other chronos Ive had kept spinning.So to wrap it up Im very picky about watches the size,look,functionality and quality were very hard for for me to find in one watch at the right price and this watch fills that roll very well."
5,Spectacular photography and a great travel guide,"Excellent introduction to the Hawaiian Islands. Spectacular photography and interesting narrative. As a former resident of Hawaii, I feel this video gives a great look at the islands and makes me want to return very soon."
2,Disappointed,"We enjoyed seeing the sites we saw on our recent trip. However, the video is VERY dated - the date stated is 1994 - 2006 for the DVD company. I would say it was more from the mid-1990's. It was really verydated in dress and certainly not as very many people in the locations as there would be today. If I wanted this to get ready for traveling there I would be disappointed and would not recommend it.Can't say we're overwhelmed with it either."
3,Good for those who plan their vacation to Hawaii,"I agree the DVD doesn't seem to have cost much money for those who produced it .The voice and the music on it are not the best and often seem boring,but the views of Hawaii are breathtaking and I can recommend this DVD for those who are planning their trip to Hawaii to get an idea what is worth seeing their.After all the price of the DVD is friendly for everybody!"
1,You can probably do better than this one,"While the photography is OK (although not spectacular) and a few bits of information are interesting and unusual, this video is otherwise barely adequate. Apparently, it was made on a small budget, by some less-than-top-quality outfit. The narrator's voice is truly annoying. The ""background"" music is intrusive and almost totally inappropriate for what is going on in the video (hokey Appalachian hillbilly music for scenes of a Hawaiian cattle ranch? - What East Coast metropolis / cave do the producers of THIS video come from, we wonder?). Some really bad scenes are used again and again, clearly stuck in to fill up time. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I really liked!"
2,Hawaii,"the video did give some interesting information, however the film quality looked like an old super 8 movie. Poor colour separation and saturation, grainy - almost looked like a wonderful patchwork quilt of archived travelogue footage from the 1960s. The information on this DVD could complement the DVD ""Over Hawaii"" which has excellent cinematography and gorgeous views from the air"
3,the narration is awful but the scenery delightful!,"The narration and music chosen for this video of wonderful scenery and gorgeous places to see in Hawaii just don't match. We enjoyed the ""trip"" (via DVD) but hated the sound. The music couldn't have been more wrong for most of it. Some shots were used several times and that became annoying.I will donate this one to the library. It was a one-time viewing. This could have been such a good video."
5,Greatest Movie Ever,"This movie is one of those rare, unknown indy's that is going to end up with a cult following. The entire premise of the movie is crazy, but it was filmed so well and the acting was so perfect that it blows even some recent blockbusters out of the water with entertainment quality,"
1,Joke doesn't even begin to describe this movie,Where to begin? Hmmm...how about everywhere. Was this written by an MTV teenie bopper? I find it hard to believe that anyone could anything appealing or enjoyable about this movie. Sooooo ridiculously bad. Still can't believe I sat through it.
4,The live disc alone is great...,it's the 2nd disc that's just OK. It could have been left off & I doubt anyone would have missed it. The 1st disc has some really great moments & of course you can't go wrong closing with Lucille. Still a very good buy for the $$.
5,Rock and Roll,"Haayy haaaaaayyyyy HAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY !!! Anyone who has seen Gillan will recognise the familiar war-cry.This album is not a gentle reflective album. It is raw, aggressive, hard, unsophisticated and PURE ROCK AND ROLL.Buy it - you will not be dissapointed."
1,don't buy,The lid on this lets steam escape from sides which makes a mess all over the counter and on the handles of cooker. I tried it twice then got a replacement cooker which did the same thing. I contacted Farberware both times to see if there was a problem with the cooker the first time I was told I may have a lemon the second I hoped they could send me a new lid that would hold the steam in and was told it was on back order and I should return the steamer to the store.
1,stopped working,"This product just stopped working after 11 months. It does not heat, nor do the lights come on. I checked the fuses and breakers. Used it maybe 10 or 15 times."
4,The Great book of Battles,"The Great Book of BattlesAuthor: Brain WilliamsThis is a great book if you like the history of wars. One of the things it talks about is the weapons used until our modern day weapons. In the past the weapons were man powered and today more are machine powered. Another thing it talks about is the great generals of their time. The appropriate age group or is seven years old or older. I recommended this book because it talks about the great victories armies had. If I gave it a rating 1-10 I would give it an 8 because it didn't talk a lot about famous battles, but it told about war in general, and didn't explain the battles in detail. My favorite part of the book talks about a general that cried because he conquered almost all the land and had no more land to conquer. I love this book."
2,Cooler in concept than in execution,"While I remain a big fan of Romero's zombie films and of the man himself, but Bruiser doesn't have the same impact of his earlier movies. Romero exploring the situation of a man who has lost everything, including his identity, sufferings from a small budget and some ridiculous character acting from the support cast. Jason Flemyng is believable as nice guy Henry and the revenge seeking man once the blank face appears, even if his American accent isn't quite on... Even for a Romero fan, this one is only a ""renter"""
3,A story of insanity meets revenge,"I was a little disappointed in this George Romero film. Maybe I was expecting a little bit more of the horror aspect of his movies. This is a story of revenge of someone that has lost everything or what Henry perceives as ""everything"". Henry systematically takes his revenge out on anyone that has screwed him over or out of something in his life. It is also a story of a mental breakdown of a ""victim"" and how Henry would deal with it. To me, there are many other movies that are the same and better than this one. Use your discretion on this one."
2,what to say?,"This movie was very strange and not very scarey at all. It was more like a long episode of the outer limits that was bad and just wouldnt end. The acting is good and bad. The plot seems to run all over the place. The makeup on the main character is amazing, but the plot and acting doesnt fall through to save this from being all around bad. Jason Flemyng is very good in this movie but the pore man just cant do it alone. The movie also has a very amazing cameo by The Misfits which is awesome. Which leads me to my point if your a huge Misfits fan and collect all the merchendise then pick this one up, however if your just a big horror movie lover pass this one up. This could have been something good, but it just fails big time."
3,Good but not great.,"George A. Romero went a direction away from his normal zombie flicks. This is a suspense thriller that has it's moments of true originality but lacks in intensity. I wouldn't consider this a classic horror film by any means, but it isn't terrible. BTW, The Misfits (Michael Graves) appear in the movie and on the special features they do a really cool music video."
3,Snoozer...,"The best thing I can say about BRUISER is that it isn't totally awful. It isn't great either. I kept waiting for the pace to pick up. Once Henry's odious wife bites the dust, things get fairly interesting, but never overly exciting or thought provoking. Now, I love Romero. I mean, his DEAD films, THE CRAZIES, MARTIN, and CREEPSHOW are all great fun. BRUISER is a so-so movie w/ few jolts or scares, and no real drama. I did enjoy Henry's gruesome daydreams and the basic idea of becoming a faceless killer in order to avenge the wrongs he's suffered. However, the ending seems very long in coming w/ not much of a payoff for the wait! Oh well, I did like seeing THE MISFITS clowning around..."
3,FACELIFT,"BRUISER marked the return of director George Romero after an extended absence. It's a strange, enigmatic film with its focus on identity, how ""invisible"" some of us can be, and how once afforded an opportunity to rebel, it becomes a Death Wish fantasy.Jason Flemyng plays the nerdish hero who is humiliated by his boss and unfaithful wife, and who wakes up one morning without a face. He seeks out all those who have wronged him.Romero's direction is appropriate and most of the performances are good: Leslie Hope as the hapless wife of Flemyng's boss; Peter Stormare as the sex-driven and greedy head of Bruiser magazine. The movie fails to make any real sense and it's ending is darkly perverse. Not a classic but entertaining in its own weird way."
3,it was definitely different,Very creative in my opinion. The characters were strong. Storyline was well done; Henry had to finally learn to stand up for himself & stop being a nobody. Not a masterpiece but still very good.
4,hells yea,this was an awesome movie even though it was low on blood and gore and more of a drama horror. But the mask is really good make up and the plot is good too and the misfits were awesome in it! They rawked with chud and michale. this is a must have for romero fans.
1,The worst,"I can't believe I bought this. Dead night in the living room. Might someday be a C movie favorite. Bad bad acting, not scary AT ALL. Bad soft core moments -- this movoe is a fast forward and eject waste of time."
5,Overlooked and Misunderstood,"This movie really doesn't get the credit it deserves, as it isn't the typically visceral fare we've come to expect from Romero. Instead, ""Bruiser"" is a thoughtful, intelligent, slowly paced film that forces you to search for meaning on your own. If you've missed this one, definately pick it up. It is well worth your time."
3,meet the fiend without a face...,"hokay...here we go...got to admit, i only bought this disc for the misfits video ""scream"" in its special features list. it is indeed the only special feature. no commentary, no trailer, no nothing. with the exception of NOLD and Dark Half, i also must confess to not being a george romero fan ( a world where romero gets more praise than tobe hooper simply scares the hell out of me)...now, that being said, bruiser was good. i was surprised. the story was strange, the performances low key, the blood-letting suprisingly low. nothing really special here...except the concept...put-upon man wakes one morning with no face and proceeds to use this semi-anonymity to take revenge upon those that have wronged him...the featureless protagonisdt of the story is creepy, harkening back to the stark white terror that mike meyers mask portrayed in Halloween, so i guess even that was pretty derivative. the misfits have a big chunk on stage at the flick's end..."
3,What happened Romero?,"I just got done watching this and all I can say is...what the hell was that? Good story and all, I really dig Jason Flemyng in this one, but damn. It's hard for me to believe that the same guy who brought us ""Dawn of the Dead"" brought us this. Definitely not what I was expecting so it was a huuuuuuge letdown. The Misfits video was gorier and more interesting I thought. Hardcore Romero fans are probably gonna eat it up, and I'll end up getting flak for this but oh well...I was severely disappointed. Rent the movie, but for godsakes don't buy it."

3,Decent Psychologial Thriller (Not a Zombie-Gore-Fest),"Okay, ""Bruiser"" is not ""Twilight of the Dead"" or whatever Romero decides to title the film we are all waiting for, but it's a good movie. Unlike some famous filmmakers ... who have taken off so many years between movies, Romero certainly hasn't lost his touch with the basics of framing his shots, editing, working with actors. This is a well-made movie. Romero is a pro.If there's a problem with ""Bruiser,"" it's one that 90 percent of all movies share: the ending just lets down one's expectations. It neither produces a worthy showdown between protagonist and villain nor does it end with a moral.Read the back cover of the disc. If the plot sounds interesting to you, give it a shot. If you are a Romero fan, give it a viewing and be happy to see that the man still knows how to put together a good film and look forward to ""Twilight"" ..."

1,Made in France since 1925,"Devotees of the revered French brand 'Le Creuset' relish the early origins of this fine cookware made in France for over 85 years. A pedigree unsurpassed, made by dedicated experienced craftsmen, passionate about quality.There is a romantic notion when creating meals using cookware stamped `Made in France'.The two items I have just received are now stamped 'Made in Thailand' doesn't quite have the same ring to it somehow.***EDIT***Upon using this casserole for the first time, it made a loud cracking sound when I gradually added a room-temperature liquid when it was hot. On closer inspection, a hair-line crack has appeared running across the width of the casserole on both sides. I am not surprised given that the item is now manufactured in Thailand and feels half the weight of my existing French made Le Creuset cookware."
4,Good product but misleading size.....,"So far this product has been great....we have made a couple of lasagne and used it as a roasting dish for veggies. The only gripe I have is that when we purchased it we thought we were getting a 10x15 dish. Wrong!! This dish is advertised by every other vendor selling it, as well as being labeled by Le Creuset, as a 9"" x 13"" dish. The reason Amazon gets away with this is that 10"" x 15"" is the outside dimension from tip of handle to tip of handle. The inside dimensions are 9"" x 13""Very misleading labeling by Amazon!! You have been warned!!"
2,:( Heartbroken,"I bought this roaster about a year ago and we have used it for so many meals! It was great for roasting duck and one-pot roast chicken dinners. I say was, because after the Mother's Day roast duck, I discovered two cracks in the pan from one side to the other - essentially splitting it in thirds. I kept the lid, thinking I could replace the pan and about two weeks ago, the knob popped off the lid. I am truly on the fence about replacing this well used (but not abused!) roaster -it worked so well and was so easy to clean. Part of me is saying this is a one-off and to just replace it, which I will probably do. Since the pan hasn't broken yet, I'm using it to store placemats on our outdoor table. (NOTE: I did not buy this roaster from Amazon, so I am have hope that it was a ""second"")."
3,Amazon sent this to me broken in pieces,"This cost just under $100 and was a gift from my husband for Mother's Day. Amazon repackaged this item with no cushioning which, of course, arrived in pieces. Since I am not the first person who has had this problem you would think that they would have fixed this issue. I say if you want this buy it somewhere else."
5,great stoneware,I love the Le Creuset line of stoneware. It isn't too heavy and cleans easily. I would recommend this to anyone. It's good as a roaster or a baking dish and the lid keeps cooked food warm.
4,Emails can actually be WORTH reading??,"Ok, so everyone deals with email daily for whatever reason...and most people I know do admitt they are helpful, they can also be ridiculous sometimes right? So meet Scott Neumann. This book is a composite of responses that ""Scott Neumann"" wrote to people on many different hilarious topics just to get a response and boy, did he ever! I can't believe people actually spent time on their computer giving ""Scott Neumann"" a serious reply. Lane Strauss is creative in where he sent our these emails and decided to publish them for our laughter. This book will make you smile and wonder what people are thinking when they log onto their emails and click on ""reply"". Definitely a book for the information highway."
5,Superb,"This book contains some magnificent meditations on the nature of love. If nothing else, I suggest you buy it for ""The General of Hot Desire,"" an interesting take on the nature of God's interaction with humanity throughout history."
5,GREAT all the way!!!!!!!!!!,The shipping was really fast. I love this product its light and it doesn't leave any greasy feeling on your face. I put it under my makeup and it controls the oil and makes my makeup last all day. I haven't found a product similar to this one. I would pay so much for it. Its so good.I recommend this product to everyone.
3,Older product.,I know this product has been discontinued so when I found it here I was really excited. I used this alot and really like the way it works. This bottle smelled a bit differently that my bottle I originally used from the store. And didn't work quite as well. But I still use it and it is better than some of the alternatives I have tried.
3,Good Book for Beginners,"First section of book dedicated to discussion of Jack Russells; very informative. Biggest drawback was last half, consisting of cookie-cutter info dealing with dogs in general. After buying a JRT and discussing dog with others, wonder if author ever owned one, or collected material through interviews/word of mouth. Will give you an overview of the breed, but not much else."
5,About the REAL Jack Russell Terrier,"Catherine Brown has written many books about the REAL Jack Russell Terrier. She explains why this breed is different from others, and why new owners need to be on their toes. Catherine has served for many years on the Board of Directors of the JRTCA, (Jack Russell Terrier Club of America) which oversees standards for the breed in the United States. She is a Terrier Trial judge, owns, hunts, and shows the Jack Russell Terrier. Her insight into this breed's history, breeding, and care is invaluable."
2,paddles not made sturdy enough for the price!,"Purchase price and quality don't line up!---we used these paddles for one event and there is already a big ding in the rubber part of ONE of the paddles. I was surprized because I didn't order the cheap brand---as we wanted these paddles to last a long time. Unfortunately, that is not the case...I was disappointed in the quality of this paddle for that reason--otherwise it handles great and love the orange balls (easier to spot when they fly off the table onto the ground)"
2,This is not what I expected,These paddles don't have cushion layers that you would normally expect. They hit the ball somewhat hard and loud. I would suggest looking for other products.
3,Not bad,"I would suggest looking for other products...The net is the best part of this, but it is kind of cheap looking.I cracked one of the balls very easily after just an hour or so of playing with it. The three stars are, however, extremely fun because of the easy access to spin. I just hope the last five last until the end of the month.Paddles are lightweight.You get what you pay for with this set"
5,SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!,"From the sprightly to the pensive, this collection of instrumentals has something for every taste and every mood. Don't be put off by religious-sounding titles, this is GOOD MUSIC."
5,Inspirational,"This CD is made for personal listening.Even though this is largely a solo-sounding effort,there is no ego here. The entire album is worshipcentric.Faithful One is my favourite song on this album.I highly recommend requesting this song on aChristian music station...I thought it was worththe price of the entire album alone.Again, the lack of any ego on the part of the artistwas striking. He sings as if his audience is in Heaven,as opposed to sitting in front of him. I thinkthat is why the album works on a personal level.If you're a worship leader, the congregation might havedifficulty singing along, but when you're driving aroundin your car, or sitting alone on a sofa, it's pretty nearperfect, in my humble opinion."
1,My hermit died.,Might not have been the food but it was fine until about a week after i started feeding him this and he just stopped playing with the rocks and stuff... then.... ya no....
4,"Good overall book, nice pictures",I enjoyed the book and read it quickly. The one problem I saw at the beginning was that there was a lot of repetition of the AKC standard and his explination of that standard. I bought the book from a pet store and paid full price. Not worth $13.
2,2004 Florida Saltwater Fish ID,"This book is awesome! It saved me a five hundred dollar fine. I bought the book right before a fishing trip-I would have kept the snapper we caught and sure enough we got checked on the way in, Thanks again, Kevin Marchetti Pensacola, FLGreat pic's too!"
3,"Cute, quick-read","This novel is a very simple, easy read, yet also contains important valuable life lessons. This book accurately portrays the ups and downs of romance and the essentiality of compromise in a successful relationship. Although the theme of the book was enjoyable I found many parts supericial and lacking in depth. Concerning Nola and Gabriel Carr, the transition from annoyance and irratation to ""falling in love"" is very abrupt and rushed. One minute they couldnt tolerate each other and the next they cant stop thinking of each other. It did not seem realistic because they hadnt really gotten to know each other well. Yet overall an enjoyable read."
1,DIDN'T LIKE,IT TASTED BAD HOW CAN I RETURN IT ONLY USED ONE OF THE PKGS. IF I CAN'T RETURN IT I WON'T BUY IN BULK AGAINSO PLEASE CALL ME
5,Journal for the American Indian Science and Engineering Society,"This high-quality periodical is filled with articles about American Indians involved in Science and Engineering,and Education, what is happening in these areas, and resources for American Indians in Science and Engineering. A section on the arts is also included. Throughout the magazine, the correlation between traditional knowledge and modern thought is constantly evaluated and supported. An excellent source."
3,Hard work!,"Oh man! I studied countless hours with this book. It beats around the bush, gives an incredable amount of definitions and makes it boring! The pictures did not help at all, all I did was ready over and over and over and over again. There is a lot of understanding in anatomy and this book did not help at all. I would suggest taking anatomy at a community college where this book is not used"
1,Principles of Anatomy & Physiology,I thought I ordered the entire book. I received only one volume of a 12 volume set.
2,Deluxe ( ???? ) Non-Stick Round Tumble Basket.,"I would hate to see this peoduct if it wasn't (Deluxe) It is not as high quality an item as what Iv'e had in the past, guess you get what u pay for!!!It works but kind of tinney!!!cheap!!I""m still looking for a better made model, still being a one piece model!"
2,Disappointing,"Despite its appealing title, cover, and organization, this book is nothing more than an Ayurvedic ""Helpful Hints from Heloise."" I was hoping for something with more depth, not tips (some so silly as ""Keep a pitcher of herb tea or sparkling mineral water in the fridge"") on how to cram more into an already hectic life."
3,not for outdoor use?!?,"I was disappointed to open the instructions and see that this security light is not recommended for use anywhere it might get wet -- you know, like outdoors, where the product photos and drawings show it being used...it seems to be working for me so far, but it hasn't rained yet...if you were planning to put the light in a sheltered location and mount the solar panel out in the sun, then that might work out better."
3,Thought Provoking,It gives its own view of Genesis. The first eleven chapters of the book of genesis are hard to understand. This will help some.
3,The subtitle is an accurate description of the book,"This book is an expository, faith-building examination of Genesis 1-11. It is well suited for someone with little or no previous exposure to the Bible-science debate. For someone already familiar with the issue, I would recommend other books, such as Keith Miller's ""Perspectives on an Evolving Creation.""The author presents multiple viewpoints fairly and comes down in favor of the framework interpretation, theistic evolution and a local flood."
3,Genesis From The Pen of Jacoby,"Dr. Douglas Jacoby is one of the best speakers and writers in the International Churches of Christ. The ICOC has been making many changes over the past few years and Jacoby is one of the leaders encouraging these changes. His writing style is graceful, biblical, and he differs where he has to with the standard interpretations.This book is an updated version of THE GOD WHO DARED. The book explores the first eleven chapters of Genesis. Jacoby takes a theistic evolution approach to Genesis 1-2. While I differ with him over this issue, Jacoby is clear that he believes God created all things and by His Word they are held together (Hebrews 1:1-3). The book offers great insights into Genesis and will encourage you in your faith."
3,How to Spoil a Good Product,"All the things the other reviewers say about the DVD navigation are true. On top of that, you sometimes cannot scroll around on the menu. Instead you have to wait for the highlight to move around and hit enter when it's on your selection. What a complete waste of parents' time! FYI, this is a collection of mini episodes. Before you realize one episode is over, you're into the next, so portion control to kids is also difficult. Disney, this is inexcusable!! 4.5 stars for content, 1 star for usability."
3,Good but no Baby Bot Chase,"This DVD is cute, but it is not a full length movie. It constantly puts you back to the menu and has a ton of previews, which can be irritating if your little one is excited about watching!! Just not one of my daughter's favorites and she is crazy about Rolie Polie Olie."
5,Keeps my son occupied for hours at a time!!!,"My son loves this DVD. It has turned him into a Polie Fan for sure. He loves to watch it right before he goes to bed. It is one of his favorites and asks for it daily. It is a typical child's movie and keeps him occupied for hours at a time. The only drawback is that it is not really long enough - definitely not movie format and there is no repeat play, urgh!!!"
3,Menu options are terrible,"Ditto for me on what others have said about the menu options for the DVD. It's a total waste of time for parents of young children who can't use a DVD remote yet. Instead of being able to navigate through menu options on your own, you have to wait while there is useless narration and for the option you want to be selected. And if you don't select your option fast enough, you have to wait until all the narration and selections are over. Very annoying!!"
4,Good Ol' Memories,"I Loved Rolie Polie Olie when I was a Kid, I was sad when they took it off disney, Luckly i found em on amazon! my son loves them ! I surely recommend this :]"
5,Very beautiful teapot,"It's an expensive teapot, but it was worth the buy. The teapot looks great empty and when it's full. The mesh hold tea leaves great. You don't know this from picture, but the mesh hold has 3 tiny holes at the bottom. Some tiny particles can go through to the pot, but when pouring, those particles rarely leave out of the spout. I usually make rooibos tea, and I enjoy every cup that I make. It's true that you have to make for a bunch of people to drink tea from it. I can see making a minimum of 3 drinking cups. Great teapot and I wouldn't have bought any other."
4,Very nice teapot!,"This teapot works well, easy to clean, and nice to look at! I can't think of anything else to say about it."
2,once again -,Great kit. until i put the stainless steel in the refrigerator one too many times? bottom fell off less than 6 months old. now i need a new one
1,arrived in shards,"The title pretty much says it all. The box was not crushed or visibly damaged, yet it did make a nice tinkling sound when I picked it up."
5,you will love it until it breaks,"IT will break. It has to. But before it does it's great. The buddha teaches that nothing on this earth is permanent; if you have embraced that lesson, then a glass tea pot is perfect for you."
5,Great teapot,"Absolutely love it. It's very elegant and delicate, so requires careful handling. Works well. Can prepeare up to 4 cups of tea. Works great for Primula Flowering Teas. The infuser is easily removed and put back in to be used for loose leaf teas."
5,Wonderful Book,"It's a wonderful book for those who love to make doll clothes. As a grandmother who enjoys making a doll wardrobe for a precious gd, I found the patterns and sewing tips very helpful."
1,Rip off,"I bought the Kindle version with the intention of printing the patterns of ""Sew Baby Doll Clothes: instructions and Full=size Patterns"". No patterns were given. I rechecked the Amazon add again and it said it contained patterns. I will not buy any other items like this again.Sew Baby Doll Clothes: Instructions and Full-size Patterns for 30+ Projects for 12"" to 22"" Dolls"
2,No patterns,I bought this book on nook. I then bought this book in the print edition to get the patterns the book title clearly says it includes. The book does not include any patterns for the clothes. I would love it if someone could tell me where to get the patterns. Don't buy this book for the patterns but it does have some cute ideasm
2,Missing patterns,I ordered this book and was so looking forward to it coming. I made sure before it was posted the patterns were complete and when it came it had got wet and there were no patterns rendering the book useless
1,upset,"Got my book today - lovely book ----- BUT NO PATTERNS. I was heart broken. I purchased a used one, but was notinformed that it did not contain the patterns. I would like to return the book and get all my money back."
2,SAME STUFF,I love his music however this CD is just a repeat of what I already have. The nocturnes are new but they are short. The rest of CD is filled up with repeat pieces. Wish he would write enough for a whole new CD.
4,"Oh, to be 17 again","Caroline Sullivan was obsessed. Sadly, her obsession was with the Bay City Rollers and it lasted four long years. Tortured by her love for the band (and their dismissal of her), she eagerly collects clippings (and on at least one occasion, a discarded cigarette butt), follows them on tour, and stalkishly hunts for information regarding their whereabouts. The Rollers provide high highs and even lower lows for Sullivan and her friends (they call themselves the Tacky Tartan Tarts), but they can't get enough. This memoir will make anyone who's ever been a fan cringe in recognition (even those with less embarrassing taste in music). The ultimate guilty pleasure and a really enjoyable read."
4,Fun if you've ever had an all emcompassing teen star crush,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but once I got a couple of chapters into it, I had an epiphany. Caroline Sullivan and her Tacky Tartan Tarts could have been me and my friends had we had the means to follow any of the teen idols we adored. That's when for me the story stopped being about the BCR and started being about a slightly tilted mirror image of myself. If you go into to this thinking you're getting great insight into Leslie, Eric, Woody, Derek, Alan et al, then this isn't the book for you. If you want to remember the pure joy you experienced in loving these guys, and you're not afraid of taking off the blinders and seeing how they saw you in return, then get this book. Thanks, Caroline, for the memories and sharing the mirror!"
4,Absolutely mortifying,"Well sure, hardcore BCR fans are going to hate this book-- but don't let that put you off this magnificently self-mortifying book. Caroline Sullivan nails the illogic of teen obsession so well I squirmed (wasn't BCR for me, fortunately-- it was the Who-- there but for the grace of god). She knew BCR were hacks and grossly untalented. She had otherwise great taste in music. And yet... and yet... Buy this book. Treasure it. And make sure to hand it down to your daughter when she gets caught up in the latest manufactured pop-- boy band-- hysteria juggernaut."
2,Intrigued to read - disappointed with Sullivan,"I too was a huge fan of The Bay City Rollers in the 70's. This book brings back some of the thrill of seeing them on TV, hearing a new song, etc - But, that's about as big as the thrill gets. Sullivan called herself a fan? Get Real! I thought this book was supposed to be about this woman's love for BCR's - more like the love of her self centered bratty self. Way to go Leslie for saying the things you said to her. One thing that really jolted me was how she seemed to relish in putting them down when their popularity started to die down a little. They were NOT a one hit wonder. And Sullivan - they did make it to the top (for quite some time), one place you'll never find yourself babe (not even for a second). Book is unrealistic."
3,Pretentious,"Her frequent use of Brit spellings and slang comes off to American eyes as pretentious, and her constant slamming of any music is very off-putting. To read her opinions, no music is up to snuff, but she still listens to it, being a 'rock journalist' now. Plus, what is the point of a tell-all if you tell very little? No names named, etc. I was hoping for so much more from this book, and feel very let down. The writer comes off as smug and self-important, as if she's so above it all. You can feel her writing the book while peering down her nose at her own words."
5,Rock-N-Roll Love Letter,"If not for the grace of God and strict parents, this could have been my story! For every fan who skipped school or work to chase the band across the country, there were thousands of us at home who loved the BCR just as deeply. This is a moving book not just about a band, or an fan, but a teen's first love.A must read for anyone who ever wore Rollergear, and a good suggestion for anyone rearing a pre-teen girl!!"
1,I had to force myself to finish,"I so looked forward to reading this book! I lived through my own fascination with Herman's Hermits, and thought sure that I'd be able to relate. No way! The obsession here was over the top, and there was nothing redeeming about this crew of older teenagers/young adults to balance the extreme. The writing was mediocre, and the insight into these girls and what drove them was superficial, at best. I couldn't like any of them and was relieved when I turned that last page."
5,unbelievable-,This is a great product I should have taken before and after pictures. Leathers got ruined in the garage all moldy and grey. I used this product and they are like new saving me hundreds of dollars I will buy this product again.Quick delivery..I purchased this product through Amazon.com
5,Great Leather Care Product,I have been using Urad for over 10 years and it is by far the best product for quick and easy care of leather shoes.
4,"Post-Pop, Global-Village, Neo-Fusion Hip Hop has Arrived","The sound of this album never stays in one place, which actually ends up working in its favor. One never knows what to expect next when one has no expectations but hearing good music. Stylistically, Radio has created quite a sollage using a pallet of new sounds and textures. The interludes between the songs tie it together nicely, although some were a bit too fr out for me. However, no one in hip-hop has the respect for MUSIC, in its total sense, that Radio has displayed."
4,I'm finally rested!,"The first night we tried this system, our daughter slept through the night (10 hours!), even though she was a bit older than the author's ideal starting point. It's now been a month, and she's still sleeping 10 hours or more 6 days out of the week, and her naps are much more restful.The only slightly negative comment I have is that there is a lot of theory in this book and not quite enough practical suggestions; we ended up changing the system a bit to suit our needs."
5,Brilliant-want to tell the world!,I received this book the day my child turned 6 weeks old-the time Dr. Tobin suugests the WOO opens. I was looking for a way to have my baby sleep without me before I tried the controlled crying thing. This book is brilliant. It gave me the know how to help my baby learn to fall asleep and stay asleep on her own. We are on day three and I am seeing nothing bu positive results. I am going to share this book with everyone I know!
2,"Good concept, not easy to apply.","I thought the concept of this book was really great...lay your baby down drowsy but awake...seems easy enough, right? Wrong. I started this when my daughter was 11 weeks old, in the peek of the ""window of opportunity"", it was incredibly difficult! It is basically standing over her while she cries it out. Maybe it works with some babies, but not with mine."
1,Worst book ever!,"This approach did not work for me for either child and I did not receive a response when I tried to contact someone at the author's website for help. Rather than inflict this on anyone else, I recycled the book. Don't buy it!"
2,Same info different book!,This book is easy to read and very reassuring but basically it's the same information you will find in other books that claim to help babies learn to sleep without crying. If you are looking for the long road to sleep training your baby...then this book has some good ideas/info. We were already using most of these techniques before I bought the book. Our little one does respond to some of the soothing techniques but it requires lots of time and persistence. We finally gave in and let her cry it out...she is sleeping much better now!
2,Disappointed,"Sadly, there is not much that is new or uniquely informative in this book. It summarizes ""baby sleep"" method history, promising a new method, but fails to really provide a succinct plan. If I'm purchasing a sleep plan book, I don't need to hear if singing is good for my baby or that I need to talk in different tones and accents to my baby...I need a plan as the author describes in the title!"
5,Beautiful Collection,"These two CDs are absolutly beautiful and at 13.99,what a buy.Anybody that loves Jim Reeves music will also love Daniel's.Carolyn J MorrisBeckville,Texas"
2,O.K. for people unable to recognize weak voices.,"I listened to this and saw this guy on PBS. It amazes me how people are able to make a career out of a voice that shouldn't even make it into your local church choir. Very week, airy, and lacking any sense of vitality or resonance. But hey, it is fine for elevators and department stores."
2,Everybody else's songs,"Daniel has a good voice which I don't deny, however if he had an original song that hasn't already been done elsewhere that would be amazing -but to each their own."
5,Excellent Compilation!,If you are a Daniel O'Donnell fan that you will love this compilation. You probably already have the songs from his many other albums but it is very nice having them on these two discs. If you are a casual fan than this is a wonderful collection to sit and listen to. I have been a fan for many a year - excellent!!
3,Shipping problems,"Our family loves these pop tarts and we were glad to find them as the grocery stores will no longer carry them. That said, at least three of the pop tart boxes were crushed upon delivery. Makes them hard to toast and eat. I am not sure who I can tell to make sure they are handled better next time."
5,"the mythical ""unfrosted"" Pop-Tart","My mom and I both agree that there needs to be more flavor offerings without frosting, because Brown Sugar Cinnamon, Strawberry, & Blueberry just aren't enough choices!!"
1,Not too happy,"Some interesting insights but the book is quite obsolete, having been published in 1964. Much is based on the author's opinions."
3,The Italians,"Getting ready for my first trip to Italy when a friend suggested I read this book and leave it on the plane. Too good of a read to leave, so I still have it. It is a easy read that prepared me to understand the massive history I saw everywhere in Italy."
4,Elegantly written yet dated,"First, I would compliment Jim Paris' intelligent review. Mr. Paris leaves me little to add. What Mr. Barzini did not foresee was the radical changes the last forty years would have on Italian culture. Divorce would never be acceptable to the Italian people, writes Barzini confidentally. Yet only a few years after this book came out, divorce was legalized in Italy. Mr. Barzini must have really be perplexed when the next level of cultural degeneration was achieved- abortion rights. Writing in the Italy of circa-1960, Mr. Barzini must not have thought the concept of abortion would ever be a part of Italian life. Yet abortion became commonplace in Italy within Mr. Barzini's lifetime. He must of felt a foreigner in his own land that he so much loved."
2,Reads like a textbook,This book is well written but seriously outdated. Looks to have been insightful 50 years ago but it reads like a textbook and unfortunately it is about as exciting as one.
3,Homeschooling: The *REALLY* Early Years!,"This was a decent read, but not as helpful as I had hoped. We made the decision to homeschool when our son was five. And although this book was specifically geared for the early years (ages 3-8), I felt it was written more for parents who had been thinking about homeschooling since their children were still in diapers. I can't imagine it being at all helpful to the families of 6, 7 or 8 year olds who had already attended public school. I found some useful information, but no more than I could have found for free on the internet. My recommendation: if you have a child who is already of school age, borrow this book from the library!"
3,"Some Good Info, but Too Limited in Scope","I agree with several other reviewers: the book seems geared toward folks who are considering homeschooling the *very* young child. I know the title states ""3- to 8-year-old,"" but a LOT of the material was geared to preschoolers and very early learners. I have a kindergartner in private school and a first-grader in public school right now, so a good bit of the information contained in the book doesn't apply to us. Also, most of the familial anecdotes and advice, as well as the authorial bias, lean toward unschooling. I understand that many families think this approach is fabulous, but there are also many of us who don't. I would have appreciated a much broader scope in that regard. Much of the curricula and other suggestions I have located elsewhere, either on the Internet or in other books. I *did* appreciate the chaper on ""Enjoying the Road Less Traveled."" Basically, I flipped through this book in one evening and wished I'd used my dollars more wisely."
4,Happy home schooling,Glad to have this available at such an awesome price. Arrived quickly and wonderful for beginning years of home school.
2,Don't bother with this one.,"I was all excited to get Linda Dobson's books. This, as well as most of the others, have been a disappointment. I hardly ever refer to them now. They weren't all that helpful at all. Her books (including this one) lack ""meat"" and are way too vague. I suppose it's a good, VERY basic, rather shallow introduction. But that's about it. The main thing that I did not appreciate about the author is her heavy unschooling bias. Not everyone is into unschooling. To the new homeschooler, that can be a real turn-off."
3,Good list of resources,"This book was inspiring, if very one-sided. It would be more convincing if the downside of homeschooling were addressed instead of swept under the carpet. Nonetheless, the author offers some useful information as well as an outstanding list of resources including books, state organizations and web pages. It's worth taking a look at."
2,Demon - Music That You Wanna Hear,"Demon goes from making excellent house to making mediocre hip-hop and R&B. An unfortunate slide. And despite trying to be make himself stand out, with the soundboy rock of ""In the Park"" or the dark groove of ""Slave for a Night"" or the digital-indie of ""Freaky"" or ""Temperature is Rising,"" the results are uniformly bleh. Awa tries her best by blasting out her vocals where necessary, but when the actual music is subpar, it doesn't do much. The best track, though, is the crazed carnival of ""All We Got Is Us,"" which shows more thought and more innovation. The rest? Don't really need to hear it."
4,Great!! just something i'd add.,"Really it's great but still, in this kind of text sometimes it's better to have notes in some texts or words because it gets tricky with some references the text makes. So, still, i had to look for a PDF version to understand some references. But this version is good!! It's more of a personal need."
3,It's OK,"I mean, it's OK; I had to read it. For a compulsory read it was, EH, I wouldn't on purpose read this for ""fun."""
2,La vida es un sueño!,"Mas sea verdad o sueño, obrar bien es lo que importa, si fuere verdad, por serlo, sino por ganar amigos para cuando despertamos."
4,Use this for SAT II along w/ math teacher and mathy friends,"This is a great book to use for the SAT II Math IIC. Make sure though, to go over questions you don't know with your teacher and/or math genius friends. I'd have to say that the only bad thing about these tests are that they don't have an explanation, hence, my recommendation to use friends and teachers. Also, I did spot a couple of mistakes and here and there, I think, but nothing major. The real test is not as hard as this, but when you do these tests, think of it as being exactly alike. I haven't gotten my scores yet but I feel pretty confidant...I think, heh."
4,booklets is an excellent idea,"The tests are good, they have errors but corrected on the author's website. The explanations have to be revised though, they could have been more detailed."
4,more useful than barron's,"Great book to use with a tutor. Some questions were exact match in the exam. I wish the solutions were printed rather than being on the net. It MUST be used with SAT II MATH WITH TI of this author. Barron's is way too hard, Kaplan is way too easy. Princeton Review is fine but it is not complete. The ideal match for the SAT IIC exam is to use:1. 10 Realistic SAT II Math 2C Test Booklets2. SAT II Math with TI3. Princeton ReviewTrust me I scored 790."
5,Good enough to eat,As always the delivery of this item was very timely and i was very pleased!!! Also the color is very vivid and looks almost like candy!! What i wanted for bikini season!!
3,3 tier wooden shelf,VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO ASSEMBLE. POSTS ARE MADE OF PLASTIC.WISH IT WAS A LITTLE MORE STURDY.ALL IN ALL IT'S A NICE ACCENTPIECE.
3,heavy and light at the same time,"3rd and the mortal has an excellent style for you who's tired of the same thing over and over. You can find heavy guitars (there are 3 guitars in the band) in contrast with a beautiful female voice, always in a slow pulsation as the song goes by. This album is not the best one, it sounds like they're not as good as they used to be. Although you can find some good emotional tunes - such as Harvest, So Pure and Hollow - try to listen to an older album as well, like Tears Laid in Earth. The trip through their music is always a pleasure."
5,Informative and Delightful,"An interesting, informative, and practical guide to the Antelope Valley and High Desert Area of California! Provides a delightul mix of historical and contemporary information. Highly Recommended!--Steve Michiels(Antelope Valley native)"
2,CD/DVD 514 Tall Lock It Up Storage Cabinet in Oak,It was a great price however it is difficult to keep open and when you do I fear it will fall forward. I now have to hire someone to mount it to the wall.
5,wonderful book,What a great book!! Great rhyme and great message in this book. A great way to tell kids how much you love them and that God loves them too. My son loves this book. He likes the part with the owl...to whooooom?
1,Waste of Money,"I've used a number of AHAVA products and I don't think they are worth the packaging they're sent in. There really is nothing exceptional about Dead Sea minerals or mud, and its not worth the cost to human lives by buying AHAVA products, since they use Palestinian resources that are illegally appropriated, according to international law, and as recognized by the United Nations."
2,Frazetta,Interesting profile of the artist and his life. This is NOT an instructional video. If you are interested in this great fantasy artist it may be for you.
5,both book and CD ROM are excellent,"I bought this package at a hotel in Thailand because I love the food there and I want to cook it. I am a novice cook but I love this package. The production values are outstanding. Each Thai ingredient is pictured and explained in detail which is really helpful to those like me who aren't sure what fish sauce or bale fruit is. There is a section on Thai culture that gives you the big picture for these dishes. The CDRom is really fun and is a model of how to do this beautifully, simply, and informatively. If you've ever eaten Thai food and want to cook it but have no idea where to start then this is perfect. It's in depth and extensive enough for experienced cooks too."
4,FRANTIC in Widescreen: FINALLY!,"If you're a fan of the oft overlooked FRANTIC, it's FINALLY in Widescreen. A comparison between this Blu-Ray version and the previous cheapie DVD is no contest.Update: I finally saw PRESUMED INNOCENT after having watched FRANTIC twice on this BluRay. PI is okay, but sort of standard mystery whodunnit. Not a dud, but kinda lifeless beside the more interesting FRANTIC."
3,"Started out great, but......","We loved this when we received it. My husband is disabled and loves his oatmeal everyday! It was working great for a few months now, but...then the lid broke :( There is a small plastic piece that is quite thin which snaps the lid closed. This piece snapped right off with no way to fix it. So, now the lid stays open. Can't boil water that way, the kettle will not stop boiling. For the price you would think that they would do away with little pieces that can break easly over time. Too bad. Thought we had one that would last a very long time."
3,just so so...,i thought delongi kettle is a stainless kettle..but it was plastic..if you want a stainless kettle..this is no good..but..if you want a plastic kettle..it is still just so so..i recomend braun kettle rather than this one..
1,Plastic,The kettle looks nice until you realize that the front part is made of plastic. Yike! Don't risk your money/health on a plastic kettle. Top quality kettle won't use unsafe material.
1,not that great,"I'm an old hand with kettles, I thought I'd give this one to my spouse for our anniversary, but it was a bit of a dud. When the kettle was ready to boil the lid would fall down, steam would go everywhere. And it would often take ages to turn itself off. Looked great but...Think I'm going to get the braun instead."
1,Absolutely terrible quality,"This is a bad product. It was shocking to see that after 2 weeks of regular use, the on-off switch simply broke and fell inside. It is hard to imagine how can anyone design such poor quality - I mean, really, it truly requires a major effort to design something that will break after 2 weeks. Also, it raises questions about quality control process of the company. Too bad."
1,Design flaws hold this kettle back,"Although I have enjoyed other Delonghi products this one is not a winner for me.The issue is that the lid release button is not so intuitive. The lid is designed to be released by a button in the handle. The button is integrated to make the product look clean but it's function isn't obvious nor intuitive. Many people have used this kettle at my house and they all push down on the lid to open it for filling. The lid is large and presents itself with a broad surface area and so this seems intuitive for the user. Unfortunately the little plastic latch inside can't handle the repeated stress of opening the lid by pushing on it and eventually fails. This results in the lid staying open and because of this, the temperature inside the kettle during boiling never reaches the point where the sensor triggers the kettle to switch off. I could see this as a product liability should the kettle run dry and cause a fire."
4,As advertised,This was a birthday present for my wife. She was thrilled. The table has only been used once only because we were remodeling and that project is finished and the table will go into full swing. The table is easy to use and the adjustments are easy once you figure how to do them.
4,A decent starter book on house rabbits,"I had to laugh at the previous review, which stated that rabbits should not be spayed! Tell that to the millions of rabbits spayed in the past 11 years since the House Rabbit Society was formed! Assuming a vet experienced with rabbits, this is now a fairly routine surgery, and it saves lives and leads to happier rabbits.That said, Ms. Pavia's book, while not House Rabbit Handbook (my #1 recommendation), is pretty good. There are a few problems with it, but overall it's a good introduction, and far better than the breeder-based books out there."
5,best rabbit care book around,this book includes the truthes about rabbits and tells the reader the right way to take care of their rabbit. esspecially the parts about greens and hay is very important
2,very basic rabbit book,There are better books out there. This one has sweet pictures and very basic information but would not be a book I run to if I get into trouble or have a real question.
1,about pet rabbits only,"It did not help me with breeding. It said that you should spay you rabbit, that is incorect info. You should never spay a rabbit or do any other sugery on them, because their skin is to fin and silky to hold stiches and then it rips."
2,"I am not sure it is a good one, becuase my is not.","I donot know for what reason that I got a damaged DVD, there is no sound with the DVD. I wonder if I can get an new one to replace it."
1,Don't bother,"Tom and Jerry's second DVD collection of classic cartoons has been butchered, like the first one. ""Mucho Mouse"" is shown in a pan-and-scan format, where no less than 40% of the picture is chopped off of the sides. Tom and Jerry should be shown in their original format. I don't care about the ""black bars,"" I want to see the full picture, and that is not what I see on this DVD. I wouldn't recommend this DVD even at a bargain price. Don't support censorship and avoid this DVD!"
1,Tom and Jerry are cool but...,"...this DVD presents them in an incorrect aspect ratio. The cartoons are unique in the fact that they have aspect ratios between 2.35:1 and 2.55:1 with some serious thought put into compositions. This DVD is just plain, old fashioned 1.33:1 (pan and scan) with half the picture hacked of the sides of each short. If Cartoon Network pay money to redub sound effects on present airings (some of which are in their OAR) then I would have assumed that Warner would also produced an anamorphic widescreen DVD with a 5.1 track.Stick to the TV airings. At least they are sporadically in the correct aspect ratio."
2,where's the picture on the cover from?,"Bought this for my son. He asks me if he can watch ""The Purple Airplane One"" but I can't seem to find it on this disc!!!"
4,Fun collection!,"This is a fun collection fo CLASSIC Tom and Jerry Videos. I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is not as exhaustive as the ""Spotlight Collections"" but I feel it is a good buy for the money. My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves them."
5,Classic Cartoons,I love Tom and Jerry. I used to watch these all the time. I used to read their books all the time. I am so glad that there is something out there that has allowed me to relive my childhood. I think any adult and child should have the plesure to watch these classic cartoons. They are a little over the top so the children should be a little older when they are allowed to watch.
1,A total mistake,"Well, I admit I like Tom & Jerry since it completed my childhood but this one is clearly not what I expected it to be. There are only like 10 episodes in it and every episode is so boring that you may doubt whether it is genuine Tom Jerry series. I will not recommend."
1,Both DVD's not working,Last time I bought 2 DVD's of Tom & Jerry - Whiskers and Tom & Jerry's Greatest Chases. Both DVD'd are 100% not working. I lost my money.
3,"tom & jerry ""whiskers away""","I ordered several 'tOM & Jerry cartoons for my 3 yeaar old Grandaughter I wanted to introduce her to the cartoons I enjoyed when I was KID. I was very pleased with the first two 1....GREATEST CHASES. 2.....TOM &JERRY TALES. however Tom & Jerry ""Whiskers Away left me a little dissapointed, however she enjoyed it, so I guess thats what matters. I will order more of these cartoons"
5,Old School Cartoons,My three year old Grandson Loves Them as much we did growing up. He watches them when we take trips.
5,Baby Boomers Blast to the Past,"All of us who are baby boomers grew up watching all the Tom and Jerry cartoons. These characters were always doing some shenanigans that made us laugh and giggle. The cartoons today are filled with so much junk. If you have grandchildren and children buy this DVD and take these kids on a blast to past when cartoons were fun and light-hearted. Bet even adults will get a real kick out of 10 full episodes of the Tom and Jerry cartoons. And the price is unbelievable for good, clean entertainment."
4,nice entertainment for my kids,It's a really nice video that keeps my son involved for at least 2-3 hours.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT - IT IS TOXIC!!!,"Please do not use this product, it is an insecticide and VERY toxic for your birds. It could kill your birds!"
3,Is this the Joshua Tree I know?,"Well yes...kind of. I'd say the general climbing scene is pretty well represented. Though I've never seen anyone climbing naked there. It was refreshing to see people on film sketching along side some cool-headed, smooth climbing (not much room for error on a free solo). For the price, I would normally expect better film and sound quality (thus the 3 star rating), but am looking forward to the next in the series anyway. Why? Because it's different than a lot of videos. Everyday climbers doing climbs that I can aspire to. Film on Michael!"
1,Counting Sheep,"A huge disappointment. I've read all the reviews and I have to wonder if I watched the same movie that everyone else did. I love Jeff Daniels and think that he is a talented actor. I am also a fan of up and coming Julian McMahon. All I can say is that their talent is wasted. If you wanted a David Lynch ..., don't waste your time - why not go to the master himself and rent Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive. As for horror, the Evil Dead series is by far the best in low budget fun, Bruce Campbell's lopped off hand by far excedes the inchworm effect of Daniel's finger. I found myself having a hard time staying awake during this movie and in fact was counting sheep."
2,Poor Jeff Daniels,"couldnt save this stinker. Attempts to be surreal and perverse and succeeds at neither. You wait the whole movie for a tie up to answer some questions, and you get nothing. Daniels is a professor whose wife never comes home, and you spend the movie wondering if he made her disappear or not. I won't spoil it for those who won't heed my warning."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This movie was a complete and utter waste of time, I don't think there was a single redeeming feature about it except for maybe the laughability of the crawling finger sequence.Chasing Sleep started out looking as though it might be alright, but about halfway through the movie, everything went downhill. The plot had potential to be interesting, but just ended up more confusing than frightening and the ending was one of the absolute worst I've seen in a VERY long time. If nothing else, I would have liked to have seen them tie up all the loose ends in the end of the movie, but you get nothing.To get to the point, this movie isn't worth the time or the money involved in watching it. I would have given it a ""0"" rather than a ""1"" if that were an acceptable rating."
5,Chilling psychological horror!,"This is an extraordinary film. An atmosphere of profound terror is created by a brillant mixture of fine acting, sparse but incisive screenplay, and hallucinatory cinematography. As a longtime devotee to the horror genre, I must give this intense experience the highest rating."
5,"Good bumper, not buts about it.",The screw on bumpers are a solid material and will stay in place. I like to keep an extra set around.
1,Poor Presentation,"This book focus on the inference process and parameter learning of bayesian netwroks, structure learning and model selection are only briefly sketched. Although incomplete, it covered enough materials as a introductory textbook in this field. Unfortuantely, however, its poor presentation may make it useless for either engineers or researchers in this field, the author hasn't given an understandable expliantion to any technical details, and the materials are not well organized.I would like to recommend ""learning bayesian network"" , which covers almost all the necessary information as an introduction and all the materials are organized in an accessible way."
1,Extremely technical book,"Too synthetic and technical to be used as an introduction to the subject, even for experienced statisticians and graduate students."
4,beautiful music from a Turkish artist,"Serdar Orta is an amazing artist..! his vocal range is impressive, and the songs are beautiful. this album is definitely one of my favourites, with a diverse spectrum of creative styles and genres. Serdar Orta utilises the Western musical tools given him, while still keeping beautiful traditional themes woven throughout.highlight tracks would include: ""Je T'Aime"" (""I Love You""--it's a French title, actually), ""Kabahat"" (""Crime""), ""Bana Özelsín"" (""You're Special to Me""), ""Heves"" (""Desire""), and ""Okyanus"" (this, the title track, means ""Ocean"").for those people who have doubts they do not wish to voice--this album is not just for Turkish or Arabic people. so ha!hurrah for Serdar Orta!!!!!"
4,great for a Cubs fan!,"This is a perfect gife to give a person who loves the Cubs and a die hard fan like my father. The only thing it didnt have and should is a bolt or soemthing to keep the hitch on... we had to hunt around for something to keep the hitch on my dad's truck...only than that, perfect and delivered on time like it stated! It was a perfect Father's Day present!"
1,I agree with the other guy!,"I had to bought this book for a class I'm attending. I first read the preview available for this book and I was kind of nervous to buy this book but I had no choice, it was necessary. The only thing I want to say is that book should not be consulted except if it is really necessary... There is virtually no links between the parts of chapters and even between the chapters. You never know what the author is trying to explain. The information is always partial, there is plenty of references to paliated this lack of usefull information. Nevertheless, I think that it is not to complicated to understand. This is mainly why I have deceided to give it 2 stars. I strongly not recommend this book to anyone: students, teachers and professionnals. There must be many better book out there! In fact, I don't think that any book can be worst. I haven't read all the book yet but I'm pretty sure that the last chapters won't be more exciting than the first half."
3,Nice Item Wrong Color....,Consistent with other reviews right item just wrong color displayed its the yellow bowtie not the blue one. Should be warned if the color not available ...
2,OK,"I ordered the Black and Blue chevy keychain, when i got it it was black and Yellow. its ok. soft rubber. well made. just wrong color. gave it two stars for good quality but wrong color"
2,BR5-49 sounds formulaic here,"Several listens later, I'm no closer to liking ""Coast to Coast."" The fresh, lively energy BR5-49 captured on their other excellent live outing, ""Live from Robert's,"" sounds formulaic here, as though the band is trying to live up to an image or type.The material seems so much in the band's comfort zone, that the members never have to really step out and shoulder much of a load, and the performers do little more than ""coast to coast"" from one song to the next. Even the onstage banter becomes more irritating with each listen."
3,BR-549,This band is one of my favorites but this CD is not one of their best. CD was in perfect condition.
4,"Turning one song into, uh, eight.","Laibach are the undisputed experts at taking mundane songs we hear on the classic rock stations and injecting them with enough histrionics to make Jim Carrey blush. SEE Laibach turn the carefree, bouncy ""woo-hoo"" of the 'Stones song into a high-stepping military march! SEE Laibach recite Mick Jagger's stoner lyrics with the growling seriousness of a United Nations oration! SEE Laibach turn the song into a funked-out disco song complete with a daffy chorus of German girls who can barely pronounce ""sympathy""!"
3,Good addition to your leather working library,"This is a good book of project and design ideas for those still mastering the skills of leathercraft, as well as, the accomplished leather worker looking for different ideas. Projects are on a basic to intermediate level of accomplishment."
1,Junk,"Piece of junk ! Can't read the "" excuses "".VERY SLOW SHIP, was told that it was lost in the warehouse."
2,Big Disappointment left hair unmanageable,"after hearing so much about this conditioner, I bought it because it was recommended to me by my hairdresser along with La maur's Bone Marrow. Bone Marrow is a better product. It leaves my hair shiny and silky and I can comb it immediately. I left this product on my hair for about 20 minutes, and my hair was all in tangles. I could hardly comb it out. I broke so much hair trying to comb my hair after rinsing it, I couldn't believe it. My hair was shiny but it doesn't detangle your hair. Let your hair dry first and then comb it out, it works a bit better. Also, I had just dyed my hair, which is a shade from black. I used this a few days after and it took out half the color. I will not be buying this again."
5,"""Memorable Melodie""","""Who is this?"" a co-worker asked excitedly when I popped the new E'lissa Jones CD into my disc drive a few weeks ago. It's true: the first track off This Melodie, ""Could It Be,"" is an instant hit single, with its catchy soul-lite chorus and angelic, uplifting vocals. But This Melodie also goes much deeper. ""Not About Love"" finds Jones bending her vocals into Sinead O'Connor-type contortions, wails, and yelps, as her lyrics paint the desperation of love gone sour. She combines the politics of What's Goin' On with the sexuality in Let's Get It On in her feminist song ""Jungle Ho."" ""Tuff Skin"" finds Jones back in Lilith territory, miming both Tracy Chapman and Desiree to great effect. Whether she's playing the world-wise woman, innocent little girl, or political rabble rouser, Jones has a great ear for style and melody that makes this particular Melodie most memorable.""By Josh Roger, The Portland Phoenix, October 30th,"
2,Good features but no battery life,This camera is one of the few with an optical viewfinder (good to use when shooting outdoor pics). Unfortunately the battery life just gets shorter and shorter -- maybe 4 or 5 pictures and then it dies. So disappointing.
1,Refurbished Fujifilm Finepix Camera,"I recently purchased this camera and the guy had told me everything would be brand new. When i received the product the looks of the camera was good but it does not function properly at all, it was a waste of money and i really wish to get it replace. i complained about it but i haven't gotten an answer from the guy ever since i first spoke to him. the quality of it looking brand new is great but the camera does not function the way it is suppose to. its not worth it."
3,Discouraged,"This ad said ""New"" crealily this was not new it was remanufactured. Clearily misleading."
4,I have enjoyed my first digital camera!,This has been a lot of fun. It is very simple to use and the photos are excellent. I went to my local CVS Pharmacy and bought film for it and they helped me out. I would recommended for beginners and all who want to enjoy taking digital pictures without spending too much.
3,"3-and-a-half stars, actually...","I've never much cared for the Chili Peppers -- in fact, I hold them directly responsible for creating the whole embarrassing ""White Boy Metal Funk"" genre. That said, I took a chance and bought By the Way last week, and I'm sure glad I did. What surprises me most about this album -- in addition to its mellow, reflective vibe -- is its nearly complete lack of irony: all these songs sound sincere, for lack of a better word (actually, screw it, there isn't a better word: these songs are sincere), and most of them wouldn't sound out of place on late-70s FM radio. And that's a compliment, in case you were wondering...."
2,What happened to the intensity?,"Man, what happened to the Chili peppers? I love the vocal harmonies, but the passion and intensity are nowhere to be found on this CD. It bored the hell out of me."
3,Mostly So-so tracks,"The new RHCP album,By The Way, has some ok songs. Most of them are slow softer tracks. I think their best album was Freaky Style. The track ""On Mercury"" reminded me of that album, which was good. Standout tracks areTearCabron-Nice latin feelOn Mecury-Freaky StyleyBy The Way-think youve heard this..Overall, its a good album to chill to, but its not RHCPS's best work. Check out Freaky Styley."
5,peppers do it again,"Awesome disc period. At no point listening to this cd do i get bored at all. The variety they present is amazing. They sound like sublime on a couple songs, and then they bust out a mexican sounding song, to go along with their usual form which is simply amazing. Flea and Frishante are two of the best guitar/bass duos in history, and Kiedis is one of the best frontmen of our time. Best Chili Peppers album yet, Best album yet this year."
3,ho hum,"By the Way see's the Chili Peppers mature into a full blown pop rock band but it remains a hit and miss affair. The album starts off with the fiery funk rock of ""By the way"" before mellowing out into beatlesque pop harmonies and light orchestration. Unfortunately the album never regains the same energy it began with. Of the 16 tracks some work very well such as ""The Zephyr song"" and the amazing closer ""Venice Queen"". Others such as ""Cant Stop"" and ""Throw away your television"" are just downright annoying. Why does keidis insist on rhyming up to 8 lines in a row? Some of his lyrics are quite awful and really bring down the songs. By the way makes for a very good summer album, but not something i would take on a desert island."
3,"No more Red hot Pepper, Tasteless like American beer","I used to be crazy RHCH fun in Japan till BSSM albums.their music before the early 90's was true music from their inside,very soulful, not looking aroud and think what most of us want.After BSSM, Contrary to getting more fun and selling more albums,they are losing their sprituallity, passtion, power.For me, Mature is being wiser to sell more albums, losing energy.I don't care this album is crafted well, But what I was expectecdfrom them is how much their passtion put in the alubum like Jimi Hendrix.SAYONARA ARIGATOU, RHCP became my passed hero."
2,"Peppers kidnapped, replaced by Train!","Sure, this is a nice album, but where did the Chili Peppers go? You know, the guys that defined funk for the 80's and 90's. This is an artsy, pleasant album with little to no evidence of the funk power of the Peppers (except three tracks: By The Way, Throw Away Your Television, and Can't Stop). If your idea of good Peppers tunes include strings, latin rhythms, keyboards, and Beach Boys harmonies, by this CD. If you want something even moderately uptempo, burn the aforementioned songs and add them to Californication. First HUGE new release disappointment of the year for me..."
3,By The Way This Sounds Like A Final Whimper,"By The Way is a very pretty and emotionally uplifting record. But i already own Incubus Morning View. I was looking for a chilli fix but instead i got the Californication bsides, at least thats what it sounds like to me. Anthony Kiedis shows why he rapped all those years ago, he can't sing. AND FLEA were are the signature bass lines, non excistant. Disappointment enshrouds me as i say REST IN PEACE to a once great and influential band."
1,"by the way, this album is horrible","as a long time fan of RHCP, I waited in great anticipation for this new release. upon first listen, I couldn't believe what they've turned into. By the Way is a regurgitation of their old sappy ballads (such as Under the Bridge) mixed with a few spacey sound effects. it's like the RHCP strapped on knee and elbow pads, buckled on a helmet, and took a bunch of prescription ibuprofen before jumping into the mosh pit of album writing. the music is weak, not at all unique, and the lyrics are horrible. please, do not spend your money on this."
1,its [stinks],"I am a huge fan of the chili peppers. I like almost all of their music. I only like 3 songs on this cd, the rest are terrible. The tracks are all lifeless and sorry attemps for singles. Compared to Britney Spears, Britney spears tops em. Do not waste you're money. Trust me."
5,A Grand Triumph !,"This album moved me. ""By the Way"" is simply, a grand triumph! It vaults the Red Hot Chili Peppers up into that rarefied air, that until now, only U2 has occupied of late. It's passionately sung and played, thoughtfully poetic, and musically beautiful. An instant classic. The RHCP are serving notice that they are a band to be reckoned with in the years ahead."
4,Peppers soft side is not as fun.,"Don't get me wrong, I love this album. It has great musicianship in it. BUT! it is too soft, cmon The Peppers make great rock songs, why are they wasting so much time on ballads. BSSM and Californician had a perfect mixture of rock and ballad. While I love ""Midnight"", ""Can't Stop"", ""Dosed"", ""On Mercury"" and of course the title track which is the only rock song on the album. ""By the Way"" is the only thing other then maybe OLP, Incubus, Weezer, and System OTD worth listening to on the radio now. Red Hot Chili Peppers still are a great band to listen to and continue to produce Grammy worthy albums, his album is sensational, but it just isn't BSSM and Californiacation. I guess I just don't blame them. I recommend this album to people who truely do love music and not what is popular, cause this album doesn't have very many radio freindly songs."
1,funk? yeah right!,"this cd is freakin' slow and boring, its perfect to put a baby to sleep. why! why! anthony did you have to change your style of music you bum! i liked you better with long blonde hair and funkier u fool!!!!!!!"
1,"Very bad,in comparison to their other material..","Evolution?...i sincerly hope this is not their way of evolving asa band.Im sorry,but this is really bad, in my opinion.I did not like Californication and this is much worse. I kind of liked One Hot Minute...but once again...no thank you. Their best and last decent album was Blood Sugar Sex Magic.Hate to say this, but unless you want more of the last 2 albums, but worse...dont pick this up.It just seems like a waste of great talent to me."
3,"awesome band, thier wrost album","I like Red Hot Chili Peppers alot only these songs are good: By the way, Cant Stop, The Zephry Song,Tear, Universally Speaking and Throw Away your TV. I would suggest Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Californication and Mothers Milk instead. Alot of the songs are slow and sound like they got one of thier old ones and just changed the words like Road Trippin or Porceline Doll on Californication. But they are a great band and puts music together geniusly and they proved manys wrong by last for more than a decaded! anyways peace"
2,More of the same (that's not a good thing),"This album is a lot like ""Californication"" in that it has a lot of mellow songs. But even Californication had some rockin songs like All around the World and Easily. Frankly, this album makes me go to sleep. I can't wait to see what their live shows end up looking like. The only song people can mosh to is By the Way. Then for the rest of the concert RHCP will have a stadium full of sleeping people.That's my story and I'm stickin to it."
2,The decline continues.,"The decline of a once powerful, compelling and funky band continues. This stuff is just a hair above Celine Dion. If this album were any good, it would still be a top 10 Amazon seller. I guess word spread quickly that it...um...well, uh...stinks."
2,Pussification,"The follow up album to Californication would have been better titled Pussification. I started listening the the RHCP with Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic and fell in love with there hard hitting, funky sound. Californication was a slight departure from this, but I still found myself liking the album. It had a good mix of songs. ""By the Way"" has good songs on it however, they are all pretty slow, at least by their standards. One of the best things about the RHCP is Flea's base playing and on this cd he doesn't get a chance to let loose. I don't think they should just keep turning out the same tunes, but why go so soft! In conclusion, it is a good cd but not a very good RHCP cd, if you know what I mean."
2,Stick to any other,"This certainly is the worst Chili Peppers record EVER, I'm only givin' 2 stars because of By The Way, a good song among such terrible music. Where is Flea's amazing bass lines, John's solos which stick into you head for weeks and that funky style that only the RHCP had? You know what ? Try Californication, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, One hot Minute or Mother's Milk and you shall have fun!"
2,Luke Warm Chili Peppers,"I'm not a ""purist,"" nor do I expect rock bands to remain stagnant in their sound. That said, ""By the Way"" is just too watered-down for me to handle. The Chili Peppers have found their niche in the ""we're weathered, but still rocking"" vein of pop. It's upsetting that a band once so strengthened by their edginess and insane concoction of different styles of music is now so benign and ineffective. John Frusciante's adeptness for writing a pop riff is heavily on display here and and the musical ability of the rest of the band is sharpened and more realized, but the delivery is ho-hum and the album is a big yawn. The coolest thing about the album is Julian Schnabel's cover art. Now that's exciting!"
2,It's just different,"First and foremost, this album is just so much different from the earlier peppers albums. BSSM and BTW are so different from each other. The Chilis have a kind of matured sound, but at the same time in my mind it is a bit bland compared to Californication and Blood Sugar Sex Magik. If you haven't previously been a great fan of the Chili Peppers, you may yet like this one."
2,I just wasn't excited,"I was excited to hear a new album was on the way. Then the local clear channel affiliate started pumping out pre-release tracks and, I got less excited. I bought it anyway. What happened to the rythm section? A drum machine could have done the work. The vocals are nice, but without any rythm to pump the lyrics up, the album falls flat for me. I see people referring to Under The Bridge, but that song, while a ballad, had some fire to it. This entire album just noodles along with some clever phrases and angst. I'll pull it out again in a week or two and try it out again, but I think this album goes in the ""failed experiment"" pile."
3,Why no crazy songs?,"Iam a huge R.H.C.P fan and I was really anxious about the new album coming out. But unfourtunally all of the songs on the cd are slow. I mean don't get me wrong I like slow chili peppers songs. But not one fast song on the cd that is going too far. There were no crazy slap bass on the cd. That is very surprising coming from flea. I miss songs like ""Get On Top"" and ""Give It Away"". I feel the band should come back with just on crazy cd with all loud songs on it to make up for ""By The Way""."
3,Not their style!,"This CD is a major dissapointment. Their new CD contains many slow beat songs and light lyrics, not there usual deal. After the mild dissapoint of Californication this is just getting stupid. The Chili Peppers should have sticked to their fast funk music. I suggest buying Blood Sex Sugar Magik(BSSM) instead, or Mother's Milk, two of their greatest alblums. If you were one of that fans that think the Chili peppers are all that because of Californiacation, your opinion on the music of the RHCP doesn't mean much. You should try getting ahold of RHCP's originals with Hillil Slovak on lead guitar. Their best CDs are all Punk and Funk music. This CD is decent I guess, they have some interesting riffs in the track Cabron, but again, it's not their style."
3,an alternative album,"i don't think enough has been said about the rhythm of flea (bass) and chad (drums) on this album. listen to the way they play together, it's awesome...i think so at least. venice queen suprised me. the cd seems too long to me, and the order of the songs doesn't seem right to me either, except for the last two....if that's a sign of things to come, then their next album could really be something. i still enjoy this CD though, I just can't listen to it as repetitively as some of their other Albums."
3,Average At Best,"It has its moments with ""by the way"" and ""zepher song"" to name a few, and i mean a fewbut the chili peppers just seemed lost in the direction they wanted to take musically with this album whether to continue with the direction attained from californication or go back in time to the sound that represented them with blood sugar"
4,good cd,"This is a good cd, but not as good as th 80's Chili Peppers. I got this cd the first day it came out, but i wasn't disapointed,i just thought it could have been better. overall there are good songs such as Can't Stop, Dosed, By the Way and Cabron. If your in for a change in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, get the cd."
2,"""The best pop CD of the decade????"" Hardly.",This CD makes an excellent frisbee. I suggest using it exclusively for that purpose.
1,Pink Warm Strawberry Cream,"This band used to be called Red Hot Chili Peppers. But with this album all all pepper has gone, it's just soft, all songs are melodic and softly romantic.. very nice but there's nothing hot... its perfectly boring."
1,"Steady slip from ""Sex"" is absolutely right","If you've read my reviews along with this one for ""By the Way"" by the Chili Peppers, then you know I have a major problem with the music industry. In listening to ""By the Way"" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, it dawned on me that the artists are more to blame than the music industry for this type of slop. With no other career options or any type of creative inspiration, The Chili Peppers release ""By the Way"" which is a horrible, market driven piece of crap that doesn't have anything in common with the work they did early 80's to 1991, lets be honest anything after Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a farse. Its a sad state of affairs that with so much money and so much music prowess The Peppers put out crappy, unimaginative music like ""By the Way"" instead of tutoring the talent that is to come. We are all doomed and aparently these idiots only care about their money. Welcome to LA I guess."
1,What happened to the real Red Hot Chili Peppers??,"Ok, this is a joke. Very funny. Now where's the real new RHCP CD??There's not one good song on this CD, it's all terrible mainstream stuff. These guys are apparently getting old and bored.Don't waste your money on this one..."
2,What's with all these glowing reviews???,"Really, it shocks me that so many people can have such a dodgy taste in music. It shocks me that this was the album to propel RHCP into global superstardom. Its an album of half-baked, limp pop-rock tunes, nothing more. Glimpses of the RHCP that produced classics like BSSM and Californication are few and far between, but can be gleamed from the brilliant intro to Can't Stop, (goes kinda downhill with that overly poppy chorus), and Don't Forget Me, (a proper move forward for RHCP). Unfortunately, it seems many people like their 'rock' diluted. By the Way, This is the Place, Universally Speaking and Minor Thing are all utterly devoid of the elements of random brilliance that made RHCP such a great band a few years back. If you're just getting into the RHCP, you should leave this one to the side and pick up BSSM. From there you'll discover the rest. Heres hoping Stadium Arcadium can salvage some of the RHCP of old..."
2,Musical Valium,"If you are looking for an album to make you sleep then look no more. I'm sorry I paid full price for this album. Except for the title track there is not much of the RHCP left, if any. The offical reviews i.e. Rolling Stone rate this better than Californication. I would like to know what universe the reviewers are living on because it sure isn't this one."
5,"Not as funky, but as strong as ever","What can I say? They aren't the Peppers we've always known. But let's face it, we all noticed a change in their music when they released Californication. Anyway, this is a great album. Older fans of the Peppers will love their maturing style. Newer fans will love the album because of the powerful and sweet vocals, solid bass, and outstanding guitar riffs. I am a true old school Peppers fan but I'll admit that By The Way is my second favorite Peppers album, right behind Mother's Milk. Buy By The Way, you'll be doing yourself a favor."
5,Their best yet...,"These guys have come a long way. They have really fine-tuned their funky sound, and learned to chill out at the same time. Flea and John Frusciante are absolutely amazing artists. Fantastic CD to listen to any time, and I can't think of any song on this CD that I don't like. They just keep getting better and better."
3,"Mature, but not innovative","Flea and the boys really started something special in the mid tolate '80s. And up until Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their music really was something to watch as a mix of so many styles. ByThe Way is not a record following that trend. It is a qualitypop record, and certainly better than 99.9 percent of the musicbeing recycled by most artists. They set the bar so high thatit's difficult to return to that level."
3,Maybe I'm missing the point...,"I don't know, I still think this is a good album and very listenable but it just didn't 'grab me' like their other work. It's as if something is missing and the rawness has been replaced by a polished radio-friendly feel. 'By the Way' left me feeling kind of empty. There has always been a sense of danger, an experimental edge, about the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I can't help but feel as though that edge is gone. Where's the funk?Please don't think for a second that I'm putting the band down, I'm a big fan, I just wasn't particularly excited by this album. Don't hate me."
5,Better than Californiacation,"I'd give this album 4.5 stars, because it isn't perfect. Almost no albums are. This album tends to lean towards being less funky than the last. It's softer, but i like it better. or me californiacation was too much. I love tracks one through eight. especially dosed. But one song i hate is cabron. basically i just love john frusciante's guitar playing. every note he hits even if it's as simple as two in a solo is just perfect. you need this album."
3,Disappointment,"I am the biggest fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I saw them with Foo Fighters a couple years ago, and over any other concert I'ver ever seen, that was the best. I love the song ""By the Way"" on this album. That's about it. Until now, I've loved every album by the Peppers. I even like One Hot Minute. Maybe I'm not used to their new style, but I think this album is very sad. They turned pop. The funk is gone. Frusciante and Flea sing way too many harmonies. I like their harmonies once in a while, but the highs don't fit. This CD is packed with soft rock and One Hot Minute-style Peppers. The Peppers used to be badass in your face rock and funk. What happened? I'm just hoping they treat this album like One Hot Minute on their tour. The only song they should play on tour is ""By the Way"". I never thought I'd be disappointed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's a sad thing."
2,"""whoa...that was wierd/.../ahhh""","These were the mottos for this cd...I was looking forward to some RCHP...but this doesn't even sound like it....I really really liked Californication....because it was melodic and had crazy solos....well this doesn't have anything...it's just all melody....I mean I like Melody...but not this kind of boring melody...Melody is a must in the music world...but RHCP never need this much melody to be a [great] band before.John Fruciante's solos have gone out the door on this cd....maybe that's why i'm so dissapointed....I mean, there are solos on this cd...but most of his solos have been replaced by wierd electronic effects.Contrary to what the Spin Magazine article said...Flea is not himself. He has replaced himself with a bassist that just follows the guitarist riffs...Hopefully I just didn't make a lot of RHCP fans not want to buy it."
2,not the best but still really good,"this chili pepper album is deffintetly not their best, however it still show the ultimate talant that these guys can still display after 20 some years of making records and the music may be getting a bit on the soft side but it's original and creative. I beleieve that this is one band that i will never give up on and just when i think i am ready they come out with a new album and blow me away...keep it up and don't stop!"
3,What&#65533;s wrong with you people?,"Blood, Sugar, Sex Magik / Mother's Milk / One Hot Minute, even Californication, those are Great Chili Peppers Albums, but ""By the way"" ?I've been a fan of the Chili Peppers from the begining but I gotta tell you objectively, with this one they went too far down the pop radio mega friendly road leaving behind their funky-hit you in the face slap bass trademark sound-behind. One of the tracks (On Mercury) even reminds me of the ""La Vida Loca"" beat.Don't get me wrong, I still think these guys are one of the best things that's happened to rock 'n roll and I respect them as musicians and artists, but please don't rate this album with five stars as if it was one of their best work because it's not."
2,"A lousy album, period.","Forget the hype. This CD, except for maybe a song or two, is one big bore. Aimless melodies, cliched lyrics, and rhythmically uninventive. Probably the worst album of their career. Save your money unless you like being bored for 70+ minutes."
5,red hot chili peppers,"by the way is a really good album.. it takes a couple listens to catch on to the catchiness of the songs... but once you get into the groove of the album, you'll be happy you bought it. at least i was. as for compairing it to the chili pepper's previous albums, its different. but then again all of their albums are distinct and unique. if you're an old chili peppers fan, just try to listen with new ears."
4,"New direction, but very good.","This album was not what I expected, but the music is great. The band has definately made a more mystic and intense style of music with this one. The depth and imagination to the guitar, bass and drums is truly awesome, and there is lot's of emotion and substance to the lyrics. I can't stop playing ""don't forget me"" to hear John Frusciante's guitar work. Overall, I'd recommend this album for getting in to some great music, but less so for ""rocking out""."
2,Ouch..,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers are trying too hard to make melodies, listen to the stronger Blood Sugar Sex Magik instead, or possibly Mothers' Milk.."
2,Steady Slip from Sex,"Man o man...anyone that claims this is the best of the Chili Peppers is NOT a Chili Peppers fan. The basslines are transparent, the vocals are...well let's just say Anthony needs to go back to rapping his bad@$$ funk rhymes, not singing about wind. The Zephyr Song is arguably the worst track RHCP has ever produced, with its intensely poppy chorus. And riddle me this...why isn't the opening lick played on the bass?!? RCHP is not, at least in my eyes, a pop alternative band. They're a hardcore funk-jam band, and this shows but a feint shadow of that. Blood Sugar Sex Magic is still the way to go, and anything before Californication, for that matter...which did have its moments, but definitely of declining quality."
2,So much for RHCP,"Lost in the fact that this is the band's most eclectic and adventurous work to date is the fact that they simply aren't a rock band anymore. The band's strong suits used to be the power-funk basslines of Flea, with Kiedis bellowing out largely meaningless lyrics. Aside from the title track and the goofy ""Can't Stop"", those traits are essentially absent. If that meant Frusciante would get to steal the show with his riffs, a la Californication, even he sounds comatose on this one. It's an album of monotone pop ballads and the occasional diversion. Two of the latter, Cabron and On Mercury, are entirely listenable, but RHCP has earned the right to have great things expected of them. This record fails to deliver."
4,"""Californication"" Part II","By the Way marked the continuation of RHCP in their alternative Californication style. Gone is the crazed white-boy funk of earlier records. We get more of the moody and haunting melodies. Both styles are fine with me, but as I grow older and the Peppers' grow older, I kind of prefer this new direction. There is a maturity in the music and the lyrics that was not there in the beginning, the boys are growing up and their music is better off for it. Certainly the title track is a strong cut, one of many. However, I think the most unique and refreshing track has to be ""Warm Tape,"" a Joy Division-like melody that sounds straight from the new wave '80s. By the way, this is another great album from one of America's greatest treasures."
5,The Chili Peppers best work EVER,"Let me start by saying what a great album. This cd has everything! From slower ballad type songs, which are awesome, to louder rock type songs like Minor Thing, this cd has it.The cd starts with the title song By the Way, which starts slow and swings to fast guitars and powerful lyrics. The song Universally Speaking comes next, and that is a very great song. To be honest I enjoyed every song on this cd in one way or another.My favorite songs on this cd are: Dosed, I Could Die For You, Midnight, Tear, and Venice Queen is great. I have listened to this entire cd at least 20 times.If you have an open mind, and don't just enjoy the Red Hot Chili Peppers Funk-Rap then you should enjoy this. I definitely enjoyed this cd and hope you will as well."
1,Buy it used if you have to have it,"Rarely in my music purchases does a CD get listened to once and get placed immediately in the ""Sell to used record store"" pile.If you really want this CD to make your collection complete, wait a few weeks. You'll find more copies of this CD for sale than the Rolling Stones ""Bridges to Babylon""."
2,Bummer Bomb for The Peps,In the past the Peppers actually understood how to play music. Now i think a monkey with a screwdriver and a hacksaw could produce sounds that would rivil with this alBUM. I also thought it lacked the hardness that the past albums had which was great. Now i am dissapointed though because i bought this CD on [amazon.com}.... I coulda bought a beattles CD or a new baseball Hat or something. In conclusion i would vote this a 2 out of 5 stars and the only reason i give it a 2 instead of a 1 is because the ... thing does make a pretty good frissbe.
3,"ummmmmm, hmmmmmm","well ive only heard maybe a half of this album, and im hesitant to buy it. from the songs that i have heard, By The Way and Tear are the only keepers. everthing else sounds like filler to me. i realize how great californication is after listening to this new album. i was hoping for more songs in the californication style of sound. Ohhh well. besides by the way and tear, what other songs make this album sound so good??? please tell me, id love to know."
3,Just Like Old Times,"This record reminds me of the good old days when it sounded like the boys from SoCal actually enjoyed each others company. Sure only two original members remain but the spirit has endured and indeed flourished. How many other bands out there show so much love for each other and have been through such trying times. It shows in the music especially with this new record as the songs form a cohesive whole that makes this the best RHCP record in many years. In the old days like Uplift Mofo the boys made up in energy what they lacked in musical apptitude, now they add the musical talent to back it up."
5,Chili Peppers best effort to date,Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from I did not really like any Chili Pepper disc until Californication. This one surpasses Californication and by a stretch. I've listened to the CD maybe 25 time or so and it just keeps getting the rotation in my CD player. The 1st 5 songs are really good and when you hit Zephyr on track 6 that is the best song on the CD. There is some filler on the back end but hey there is 16 songs on this CD and I think 12 or 13 of them are really good. If you liked Californication you will love this CD if not then maybe not
4,A bid for popular radio acceptance here,"Follows the trend set by Californication: less image mongering, more song writing. Long time fans express disappointment. If this continues, the R.H.C.P. might actually become a popular music act. At any rate, it appears that they are calling an end to their 20 year career as an oddball freak-show, whose main reason for existence seemed to be entertaining the record company company executives."
4,A gorgeous triumph; Chilis at the top of their game at last.,"This record swims with beauty and pulses with funky rhythm; if Calfornication was the investment, By The Way is the payoff. We hear the Chilis mastering their melodic gifts. From sharp hip-hop to lush strings, fiery latin to staccato bass, they are as eclectic as they are unique. ""Midnight"" in particular must be heard to be believed. I got this record months ago and that song still amazes. The reviewer who called By the Way a ""waste of musicianship"" is a fool. Do yourself a favor and pick it up, even if you don't consider yourself a Red Hot Chili Peppers Fan. That the Chilis are pioneers has been evident all along, but By The Way proves that they have the musicianship to match their invention."
2,I'd pass this one by,I bought this and Stadium Acradium at the same time. This cd stinks. Stadium is so much better. By the way is their weakest cd. I cant believe all the good reviews this has gotten. If your a die hard fan I guess you have to buy this but this is a clunker. Two ok songs on it. The rest are forgettable.
2,SAD SAD SAD.,"LET ME START BY SAYING I STILL LOVE THE BAND.BUT THIS LAST ONE IS SAD.AS IN CALIFORNICATION THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO PUT ANTHONY UP FRONT IN THE MIX.DON'T THEY KNOW THAT THE STRENGHTH IN THE BAND IS FLEA AND CHAD.THEY DONT STAND OUT ANYMORE.SINCE THE INVENTION OF AUTOTUNE.THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE ANTHONY A SINGER.BUT STILL, HE CANT WRITE LYRICS.HE NEVER REALLY COULD BUT THIS ALBUM IS BAD.THERE ARE A FEW DECENT SONGS THOUGH.ONE BEING THE TITLE SONG."
4,Why the Peppers are elite,"The Red Hot Chili Peppers early efforts were impressive for their sheer speed and funkiness, no doubt. But after a couple spins, it became too much of a good thing. Not enough diversity. Now an older, wiser group of sock-wearers have matured into a band that seems very comfortable in their skin. Flea is happy with simple melodic baselines, but will still jam when necessary. Anthony sings etherel lyrics, but can still dish out the tongue-twisters. Most importantly, the reunion with John on guitar since Californication has brought the magic back. By The Way is not the masterpiece I believe Californication to be, but tracks such as ""Dosed"" and ""I Could Die For You"" remind me just how good songs can be."
3,Personal review,"I have always loved red hot. I always tough BSSM was there best album... and I think I'm still right. BTW is really beautiful but when I listen to RHCP, i'm not looking for this kind of music. I'm looking for something a lot more funkier and rock...BTW has beautiful variations and cool songs such as Midnight and Dosed but still, I find it too ... well, not red hot. I like this album, but it's not the kind of sound I'm looking for when I listen to these guys."
4,No filler!,"Seriously, every song is really, really good. The Chili peppers have slowed down the pace on this album, continuing on from ""californication"", the tunes are melodic and each in its own right is a masterpiece.The worst song IMO is ""cabron"" and even that is not that bad. This album still has some funky-rock/rap songs such as ""cant stop"", ""By the way"", ""Throw Away Your Television"". ""Tear"", ""Dosed"", ""This is The Place"" are slower rock songs, all very nice. ""zephyr song"" and ""universally speaking"" are worth mentioning aswell.I give it 4 stars because Californication is better (afterall it had ""otherside"", ""road trippin"" and ""scar tissue""). This is not like Blood, Sugar. If you want classic chili peppers get that, but if you prefer slower melodic rock, get ""By The Way"" and ""Californication""."
4,Lovely Rock,"This may not be Funk-Rock or Hard-Rock, but it sure is good. This is, in fact, a really good CD. Most of the songs are mellow rock, with a few experimental flourishes. It's got plenty of big hits and beautiful moments throughout. While I do like Claifornication better, I must say this is one of the Pepper's best efforts, and people who like sungs like ""Under the Bridge"", ""Otherside"", and ""Scar Tissue"" would very likely enjoy this as much as I."
1,Am I in another dimension?,"I want my money back! RHCP ripped me off! I'll describe this CD in two words and one sound: Weak, boring and ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. What happened to your instruments guys? Don't get me wrong, I've liked every RHCP CD to date even One Hot Minute, but after struggling to listen to this CD 3 times, I had to play Californication just to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Gone are the great guitar parts and good drum playing; in are the bad lyrics and sleepy uninspired music. I hope the RHCP take an about face for their next CD and get back to some better writing - I don't expect hard funk, just good song writing with some inspiration to it. I expected more after waiting 3 years. What a bummer."
2,"Only ""One Hot Minute"" is worse.","Highlights from this album are ONLY ""On Mercury,"" ""Can't Stop,"" and ""The Zephyr Song"". Most disappointing follow-up album EVER. Only the ""One Hot Minute"" album is worse in the RHCP catalog. Read Kiedis' autobiography- Flea almost left the band because this album sucked so INCREDIBLY bad. If you want solid RHCP, check out Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Californication, or Stadium Arcadium. Anyone who equates By The Way with ANY of these albums or somehow thinks it is pffffff (HA!) better than any of these albums is a complete Idiot and ought to be dragged out into the street and shot."
2,Not there best. Get BSSM or SA (Stadium Arcadium),"OK, first of only By The Way,The Zephyr Song and Can't Stop, are the only real decent ones, I mean This Is The Please and Venice Queen good, but all the rest are dissapointing.I picked up Stadium Arcadium the other day, and loved that, so this just seems so underdog compared to it."
4,Great,"I love this album! its so great, they have matured in the sound, and it is a good easy listen. An absolute MUST for RHCP fans!"
2,Who are you and what have you done with the Chili Peppers?!,"Boy, was I disappointed with this CD. I've been a big fan of RHCP since Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but this album just bored me. I haven't even been able to force myself to listen to it--I'll probably wind up selling it, and I *rarely* sell a disc, much less a RHCP disc. My advice: don't bother with this one. I even like One Hot Minute more than this disc, by a long shot."
5,Puts You in a Great Mood,"This CD is absolutely the best album I have ever heard. Every single track (I'm I'm not lying here)is beautiful. Some great tracks would be the funky ""By the Way"" and ""Minor Thing"". But the Chili Peppers don't just stop at making great tracks; they easily ascend to creating perfect tracks with ""The Zephyr Song"", ""This is the Place"" and the greatest song I have ever heard, ""Tear"". Normally, I'm into heavier stuff such as Ozzy, System of A Down, and Black Label Society, but ""Tear"" moved me in a way no song ever has. I was stressed about college and life in general but ""Tear"" made me forget my troubles and want to enjoy life. The same goes for the rest of the CD. To me, the Chili Peppers created a very spiritual record that will go down as easily my favorite record of all time."
5,I have only heard a few songs,"I have only heard a few songs. Dosed, Tear, Minor Thing, and Venice Queen. They are all excellent. Sounds like an evolution from Californication...with much more melodic playing. Guitar sounds really good also. Honestly, with the exception of a few moments, this sounds like an entirely new RHCP...takes Californication to a new level."
5,The best kind of followup,"This is by far one of the greatest follow-ups to date. Just when you thought it wasn't possible to top Californication, ""By the Way"" delivers! I'm a big fan of the Peppers and I must say that this album has everything we've come to expect from the band and more. From catchy guitar riffs to fun lyrics and vocals to match, this album is one of the year's must haves for sure. My personal favorite is #7 (Can't Stop). Support this great band and put up the bucks to buy this great CD!"
5,Good business approach!,"I agree with guys who wrote that Peppers lost spirituality in their songs. It looks like they are doing a marketing research on which style we should go next. If it's like this then I vote for ""Can't stop"" song and ""Zephyr"", or at least ""By the Way"". Sure, with this album they will gain different listeners group, as they started doing this from ""Californication"", and then feed them with more and more pop songs.Sad.I put 5 stars not to lower their sales on Amazon in the honor of their previous albums."
3,A sufficient followup to Californication,"I thought Californication was one of the best albums I have ever heard. It would take a lot for me to be satisfied with ""By The Way"". The Chili Peppers assure a decent album by packing 16 tracks onto this album, many of which, including the title track, By the Way, Tear, and The Zephyr Song are unique and enjoyable to listen to. Some of the others simply sound too much alike. I love the sound of these guys and I will keep listening, but I feel that in a year or so, the album I will resort to for my Chili Pepper fix will be Californication or Blood Sugar Sex Magik."
3,"Okay, but lacking their energy","My girlfriend got me the Peppers new album and i had high hopes since californiation is one of my favorite albums of all time. after listening to every track on by the way, i was left wanting more and i was disappointed that there wasnt any more. there are a few good mellow songs (4,5,8) and by the way and cant stop are sweet but all the rest [don't compair]! carbon is different, but i was hoping for more energy in this album and not so much the mellowness. this album is good for rhcp fans but not good if you are not into them already. i think the money for the album is worth it anyways"
4,Rock CD of the year,"This is easily the rock cd of the year. There isn't one bad song on this album. This album is their best yet; the most creative, melodic, original, lyrically-developed, and dynamic. It is even better than Californication, which had one or two bad songs. This album is destined to be one of the all-time greatest rock albums; up there with ""Are You Experienced?"", Zeppelin's ""IV"", and the Stones' ""Sticky Fingers""."
4,Good Stuff,"This here, the follow-up to RHCP's 1999 album of the year ""californication"" isnt too bad, not too bad at all actually. there are some very good songs here. songs like the title track, ""cant stop"", ""throw away your television"", and ""ca bron"" will get you on your feet, while songs like ""midnight"", ""tear"", and ""this is the place"" will make you think. Every song here is inspired and unique with some sort of meaning too it, just like all chili pepper songs. this is sure to satisfy rhcp fans, old and new. it sure satisfied me."
5,"Different, but not bad at all","I own all of the cds by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They have been my favorite band of all time since fourth grade. I am listening to the cd as I write this review. The new sound seems to be some kind of tribute towards Hillel Slovak, their original guitarist who died of herione overdose. The band has gone through many changes and different members ever since first concieved by Flea and Anthony Kiedis. Among them have been Jack, Hillel, John, Chad, and Dave. The band of change has finally matured and found a new sound. The songs that stand out, such as By The Way, Dosed, Can't Stop, and I Could Die For You really express how the band has changed from the early days of coyotes and anti beat box bands. If you are in any way a fan for the chili peppers, or enjoy alternetive rock in general, you must buy this cd."
4,JUST NOT THEIR OLD-SELF,"NOW THIS IS A POST-CALIFORNICATION RELEASE.PEOPLE WHO LIKED THEIR EARLIER FUNK-SOUND MAY FIND THIS A LITTLE TOO MELLOW.BUT EVER SINCE I BOUGHT THIS I HAVE NOT STOPPED LISTENING TO IT.I MEAN NOTHING CAN BEAT BLOOD,SUGAR,SEX,MAGIK,BUT THIS IS DEFINITEVELY BETTER THAN CALIFORNICATION.SONGS ""CANT STOP"",""BY THE WAY""ARE PURE MAGIC.ALSO ""CABRON"",""THIS IS THE PLACE"",""THROW AWAY YOUR TELEVISION"",""VENICE QUEEN"" ARE ADDICTIVE.THIS BAND SURELY RULES!"
3,SOME GREAT SONGS FROM RHCP!!!,"By the Way got some great songs like the title track, ZEPHYR SONG and CAN't STOP, but also a lot of slow boring ones like THIS IS THE PLACE, I COULD DIE FOR YOU and TEAR...Well, this is when the CHILI PEPPERS really start to produce a lot of uninspired mellow tunes...BY THE WAY got some great songs, but try their best stuff like MOTHER's MILK, BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK, CALIFORNICATION and ONE HOT MINUTE..."
5,Maturing Peppers,"I don't understand some of the negative reviews.Granted the cd doesn't have the ""edge"" of previous pepper pursuits,the music is truly progressive and innovative. These guys are artists and along with maturity comes change.I know it must be a challenge for some of the harsh critics of the cd to listen to more than 3 chords and chew gum at the same time while combating cotton mouth and twirling glowsticks while attending their latest rave."
2,Their first CD I can't play through,"For over 16 years, I have been anxiously awaiting the new releases from the RHCP. With each release I am ecstatic at the quality and originality of funk, jazz, rock, and rap they are ale to fuse into classic hits. However, this time I am extremely disappointed at their decision to go with much slower songs and drop the heavy funk that built their popularity for years. Other than the title track, the cd might be good for those long road trips to put the kids to sleep. This album is definitely NOT what you would expect from the band after all these years."
5,"By the way, THIS CD ROCKS!!!","By the way is the best song I have ever heard!!!!!!!The music video is cool, too."
5,Don't let the album cover fool you,"Definitely their best disc since BLOOD, SUGAR. One of the few discs these days that you can actually listen to straight through and enjoy every song. This disc just grows on you the more you listen to it. Possibly the best release of 2002..."
4,A Review for the new Peppers album!,"Check out a review of the RHCP album ""By the Way"" at The Trades here:http://www.the-trades.com/column.php?columnid=1261"
2,Albums [stinks],The only good song is By the Way this albums is way to soft for me i liked californication cause it seemed like they were having fun and rocking out but this time it seems like they are like all mellow and not really rock at all i dont really like it. sorry guys its not worth buying because if you're like me u like the rock red hot chili peppers and not the soft mellow red hot chili peppers.
4,"I'm far from a bona fide RCHP fan, but . . .",". . .I like this album. By the Way seems to be a collection of similar songs--often the same chord progressions and minor keys--but each song maintains a separate thought organized separately. I sincerely appreciate the production on this album and I describe it as my Album of Summer 2002. Californication remains a genius album giving way to this decent follow-up. I appreciate this album also because the songs display lyrical, deep and not overly punky and obnoxious proof of RCHP's musicality. When compared to my normal listening collection of Faithless, Everything But the Girl and other electronic music, RCHPeppers hold my interest. Nice."
2,Average music from a band that should know better.,"And yes I am bitter. I'm bitter becasue as a kid I remember that the Chili Peppers were that out of control messed up brand of punk-soul fusion that made everything seem better through it's magical filter. Uplift Mofo, Freaky Style and the S/T where amazing displayes of energy and soul. Part of me wishes that ""Under The Bridge"" was never written. It seems like ever since they have slipped further and further downhill. There are enough crappy pop-punk-jazzhop albums out there without the Chili Peppers recording something like ""By the Way"", Unlike the above mentioned albums that I still listen to 10 years later, this newest instalment is instantly forgettable. I can't help but to think that when Hillel died a piece of the Chili Peppers died, and they've been lost ever since."
1,not a great album,"this album was cheaply made. plainly put, i bought both this album and californication, well i learned both of them on drums in one week! not great musicianship between the two albums, not a great buy if you take my word!"
3,Mild Peppers,"It takes seven songs in to ""By The Way"" before the familiar popping base of Flea and the rapping howl of Anthony Kiedis. The first six tracks? Gently melodic songs that play out as cool, focused. I guess we should have seen this coming from the muted blue colors in the soft art cover; this is the Peppers cooling off after the fiery ""Californication.""There's plenty of decent songs on ""By The Way,"" problem is, there's nothing excellent. The songs come off as self-search, introspective and slow. The title song and the ""Warm Tape"" are the best of the ballads here. But the band's always worked best under the operative ""Red Hot"" part of their name. This is like asking for the espresso burrito and finding out they put cool ranch on your meal."
5,Awesome,"This is a follow-up to the excellent Californication. Another great album, By the Way is the ideal rock summer release. With a sunny California vibe mixed with sad undertones, it taps into both a rock attitude and a summer desire to relax and have fun.Though fans of early RHCP may not like the fact that it lays off the funk and rap of the 90's, the song quality of this record makes it their best. Each song is catchy enough to inspire multiple listens, and many are sure to become RHCP staples."
3,"Good, but it's still no Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik","This is a very good cd and it is worth buying to put with your other rhcp cds, but if you are expecting their old stuff, turn away right now. By the way is a mellow cd, but it is still good. I saw them preform some of these songs in concert...they were absolutly amazing, go see them, and support the band!"
5,Best-selling album ever?,"Little known fact: Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" album has sold 55-57 million copies worldwide, a world record for the best selling record ever. The Red Hot Chili Peppers ""By The Way"" album has sold 50 million worldwide. The album's still selling like crazy, after it's release one year ago. It might surpass Michael Jackson's record in the next few months. That's how good this album is. Check it out..."
5,Sweet Album,"Anyone that doesn't think this album is sweet should get a life right now. It has funky tracks, soulful tracks, and flat out awesome tracks. If you dont believe me, ask one of the other 21 million people worldwide that have purchased it. An interesting tidbit: it has sold five million copies in Ireland, meaning that one in every seven people over there owns the album."
2,Good for a couple of listens,"I was a huge fan of Californication, and supportive of RHCP's turning away from white funk towards California-style rock. By the Way definitely continues this trend, but unfortunately the quality of songwriting is nowhere near as strong as it was on Californication. The first few times you hear the songs on By The Way, you'll note how catchy they are. However, they do not stick in your head and ""catchy"" turns to ""boring"" after a few listens. This CD is already collecting dust on my shelf..."
2,Any band could have made this cd,"Before writing this review I wondered what i liked most about Red Hot Chili Peppers. And after due consideration i concluded it's the way they mixed ""punkrock"" with funk and rap. And that is exactly what's missing on this cd. The single ""by the way"" is the best song on the cd and might mislead the unknowing buyer. This is not RHCP as i liked them most. If you are into more ""MTV-ish"" like music you might like it. I hope for the real RHCP diehearts they will return to their roots."
5,The soundtrack to my life,"If I was stranded on an island for the rest of my life all I would need is food and this ""By The Way"" CD... I am guy who likes music in all its different forms, and I have come to the conclusion that this album is the most PERFECT album ever made.My love for this album cannot be described in words, but the feeling I get from listening to every one of these tracks is just amazing. I like all of their albums, but this one is just, just.... PERFECTION.It makes me sick to think that some people could say that in this album they lost their ""funk"" or whatever. Anyone who would say this just doesn't understand what the chili peppers are about.This is the only album which I have listened for over 10 years and I'm still not tired of (I just appreciate it more and more)BUY THIS ALBUM"
2,Some of the weakest material of their career.,"Ignore all the self-delusional folks giving this CD five stars. It's not even close to worthy of 5 stars. There's a handful of decent tunes on it. The rest is filler, some of it quite poor. Save your money and pick up one of their earlier works. They're much more fun."
2,OK,"As much as i wish it weren't true, it's definitely a let down. I absolutely hated it at first, searching desperately for funk in any shape or form, but it grows on you if you're persistent and listen to it a lot. And i mean a lot. If you're not a fan, check out ANY of their other albums - Californication, One Hot Minute, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Mother's Milk, and Uplift Mofo Party Plan, which are all among the GREATEST albums of all time. Hopefully they'll rediscover that which has made them the greatest band on earth in the near future. But if you're a fan i say go for it, you'll find something you'll appreciate."
3,First Impression,"The first impression after listening to By the Way all in one seating is - it's less powerful than Californication, less energetic, more streched at times.I've become an RHCP fan after Californication - was hardly aware of them before. Their 1999 album was a true breakthrough and I expected to see the trend to continue. Instead, I heard a much stranger mix that reminded me of Doors, Simon & Garfunkel, Beatles..not that it's a bad thing, I just expected something less subtle...the title song fell out of the picture, though - it's by far my favorite from the album.When the last song finished, I replayed the title song. I regretted that RHCP certainly departed further from punk-like Californication. Now, however, that my expectations are defined, I'll listen to it the second time."
4,I would give it 4.5 stars if i could,"I bought this album hoping for an album much like Californication, but upon first hearing the second track, i knew it wasnt gonna be the same. However, this album is still a must have for a RHCP fan. The next day i found myself humming the tunes and quoting various phrases from a lot of songs on this album and i havnt gone a day wihtout listening to this album at least twice through. I found a lot of songs just drift you away such as the guitar in ""Dosed"", and the intro to ""Cabron"" which is sooo sweet. The only song i skip is ""Throw away your television"" which is still an alright song. ""Cant Stop"", ""On Mercury"", ""This is the Place"", ""I Could die for you"" and ""Monor Thing"" are the kinda songs u hear once and already like it. I fell in love with it the second time i heard it and cant go a day without hearing it and am already anxiously awaiting to hear what they come out with next and as well as to which songs will have videos. JUST BUY IT"
4,More of the Same...,"Not a BAD thing, but RHCP shows little progress from the amazing ""Californication,"" which found them quantum-leaping from previous work and earmarked them, finally, as a band that is going to mature and is going be with us for a while. If you liked ""Californication,"" you'll probably like this one."
4,well... back in the day the peppers were the coolest!,"Why did the chilly peppers make a cd like this?? btw is a good cd in that every track has its merits, but overall this cd is quite bland. This cd sounds more pop than anything.. not a bad cd but a loong looooooong way from chilly peppers at their best. flea trademark baselines are non-existent!! why?!! a lot of the tracks sound too weird to get into.. anywayz i only recommend this cd to die hard chilly peppers fans (like myself). if your just getting into the peppers for gods sake buy these 3 cds: californication, blood sugar sex majik and their What hits? compilation cd.. or if just one cd get cali.. oh and mothers milk (if you have the cash).. well, thats just my 2 cents"
4,Definitely Not The Best,"This album is good, don't get me wrong, but its not on the level of BloodSugarSexMagik or Californication. THe Peppers have lost something, an edge that they had, they seem slightly bland. Their music is still great, but it has lost some edge. There seem to be recording issues as well. I love anthony kiedis's voice, but it is overly piercing on this album. It goes straight through you. The new idea to have somebody in the band, I don't know who, sing very high background vocals was also a bad idea. The songs can get a cheesy quality which I never thought the Peppers could have. But this album is still good. Don't forget me, BY The Way(which is one of only a few songs that have the funk RHCP) and Venice Queen are my favorite songs. Cabron also has a great Flamenco guitar part. If you're a fan of slower, softer RHCP, this album is for you. If you're a funk RHCP lover, keep listening to By The Way on the radio. Still a good album though."
5,Good hand bypass clippers,"I probably would never pay $40 or $50 for hand clippers as I have not yet achieved a high income bracket, but I found these on sale somewhere for $20, and for that price they are great."
1,Not at all useful,"I purchased this book to learn about how to prune my fruit trees. While I have an upright peach, this book tells how to train a peach tree as an espalier. Even those directions were not as good as the ones in The Complete Book of Topiary by Barbara Gallup and Deborah Reich. I also have an upright apple tree. He only talks about how to prune a bush apple. I have never heard of a bush apple. The book costs $9.95 and would cost $3.99 plus postage to return."
2,Disappointing,"I saw that the author of this book was a fellow fan of Patricia Veryan on some site or other, and that she listed her as one of her influences. So I was looking forward to reading this, and her previous book, The Ideal Bride. Unfortunately, this book didn't live up to it's promise.For one thing, it might as well be taking place in modern times, since there's nothing ""Regency"" about it other than the fact that the author tells us it is set then. Arabella acts nothing like a Regency girl would behave, and St Fell is just...annoying. The plot is shallow, the minor characters are more interesting than the main ones, and there's no real climax to the story, just a lot of confusion. Overall, that's the impression I was left with--confusion. Heavily edited, this might be a decent book, but as is, it isn't worth the money."
2,"Great music, horrible voice","As the previous reviewer points out, the choice of music is fantastic, and would be a lovely program. Ms. Pryde, though, ought not sing until she works out her vocal problems, of which there are many. The straight tone, often landing south of the pitch, is absolutely frightful. It smacks of serious vocal pathology. I also question the genre-style of attempting chest voice to such high registers wherein the voice cannot sustain it properly. Proper coaching and editing could have elminated the poor pitch issues (the ascending tones of the Schwartz comes to mind), but the vocal problems overshadow it all. Ms. Leon's piano is lovely, and very sensitive, but alas, poorly matched in Ms. Pryde."
4,It's wonderful to be a woman!,"After reading this book I no longer felt ashamed that my body isn't akin to Twiggy or Kate Moss. Soft curves and a healthy body are a wonderful formula according to the author -why must we emaciate our feminine attributes? Buy this book for the woman you love, it's a healthy alternative to starvation diets and malnutrition."
5,"Beautiful Women, Beautiful Pictures, Beautiful Book!","Considered merely as an art book, 'Zaftig' deserves attention. The reproductions are stunning, and the selection is *generous*, with plenty of interesting, even amusing, surprises.The women celebrated in these pictures were anything but apologetic about their *abounding* voluptuousness. They gloried in it. The woman of today who resembles a Titian goddess has *ample* reason to carry her curves with pride, as this vastly pleasurable collection illustrates.The pity is that we've been *reduced* to needing a book like this one. That said, the editor has won his case with a brilliantly persuasive appeal to the senses."
2,Great Songs - Poor Recording Quality,"Although the song titles are great, the music sounds very flat. these songs are all likely original recordings. If you want to hear the original sound and imagine your stereo systems as one of those old horn-type record players, you'll love this CD. Otherwise, find something else."
3,BigBand,I liked the CD. The only thing I didn't like was that only one of the songs had lyrics and the rest were just instrumental (although I know some of the others had words to them).
3,It's OK,"For me about half the album was boring. I was hoping to get a good cross section of period popular music. It's OK, but had to do over again, I'd look for another option."
3,The title's right,"I'm not the largest Big Band fan in the world but I wanted this album because of one song - ""Sing, Sing Sing"" with a fabulous drum solo by Gene Krupa is a must. And I found other Big Band classics that I very much enjoy and a few that are less than classic."
1,Brash,I have 100's of CD's all different kind of music. I bought this after reading all of the reviews on amazon. But Im disappointed. Ive had it on twice and find myself turning it off.
3,Good collection,"Nice collection of big band sounds. I love the music of this era, and I think the only thing missing is that I just want to hear more. Some of the songs are unfamiliar but that's not a bad thing. I would have enjoyed a few different selections more instead however."
2,A few of the songs were good,I bought this for my mother and felt that half of the songs were not of the type expected by the title of the album.
3,Bought for a gift,"This CD was bought as a Christmas gift for my Dad, so I suppose we'd need his input later this year. I imagine he will enjoy it."
5,The Only Big Band CD You'll Ever Need,It's a great cd to listen to while my students are doing math.
4,okay,"My dog is a yellow spot machine. This product works but not consitently.Overall I will keep using it, but I wish someone could creat a product that prevents the burn spots vs. repairs them."
3,works ok...ordered another bottle,"This product helps some, but really nothing can help dead grass by dog urine..i bought another bottle as it helps somewhat."
3,Not what I was expecting,"While this book came highly recommended, it's not what I was expecting. I wanted recipes for specific combinations of juices for specific situations, and I'm sure that if you sat down and really READ through the book you would be able to come up with all sorts of solutions, however it felt like doing biology homework to me."
3,Photos,Would have been good to have photos of what drinks should look like. Photos tell a thousand words thay say.
5,if you really want to know about getting better with life this book is for you,"Norman Walker has the best books for getting better with your life. It is really great information on your health. Enjoy good reading, it will help you."
4,very informative,"this book is very informative, a little too much info regarding the science behind fruit, vegetables and juice. If the lay person reads the book slowly it is informative."
1,Not Suitable for Kindle,"Perhaps the most important parts of this book are the charts with recipes. They are impossible to read on the Kindle; they are very small and cannot be enlarged...apparently they are graphic images and not text. It is also impossible on the Kindle to find the page references mentioned in the text, since these references refer to the printed edition. It's a good book, but only buy it in a print edition."
5,Fantastic...,I bought the first album by Llama on a whim because I found the name to be interesting. The music that these guys make is amazing and instrumentally sound. If you enjoy good music on the vein of Phish then you will like this band.
5,Beautiful and Enchanting,"This film almost made me forget it was subtitled, it flowed so well, and the cinematography was outstanding.Big Girls Don't Cry is a beautiful coming of age film out of Germany. Two adolescent girls struggle with the truths of growing up and realizing that ones parents can be even more flawed than their teenagers. Not for the faint of heart; but a touching film for all of us who have survived growing up."
3,"Good, but not great...","We purchased this brush to handle our two Pembroke Welsh Corgis (double-coat, medium length). The two heads are GREAT: they give us flexibility depending on the need. However, the handle is made separate from the head, and the joint has been loose on two brushes that we purchased. This gives an odd sensation while brushing, corrected by a bit of superglue. The pin head has coated pins, but these will come off relatively soon. The brush continues to work, but we tend to be a bit more attentive when using the pin side once the covers start to come off.For a light user, this would be a great brush. As a heavy user, I'd think twice..."
2,GOOD BOOK FOR HP BEGINNERS,"I was very disappointed with this book. It mainly concentrated on the basics and not enough on the technical aspects. I would not recommend this book for anyone that already has 6 months to 1 yrs worth of experience, you most likely already possess this knowledge. I bought the book because it had a section that discussed performance tuning, again this section only captured the basics. If you are a beginner this book is excellent and does present examples that are very well explained."
2,Not new as declared.,"The description said it is new, but it is not and does not work with my Mini. I had to buy a different microphone."
5,Great,Received the book on time and although it was an used old book it was in better conditions than expected.
4,"Excellent Paddle for Players, Good Thickness, Ok on Tact","I purchased this paddle for my wife, while I purchased the EuroTech. The EuroTech is great for me for strong spin, Control, and Playing deep off of the table. My wife plays closer, and is not as hard of a spinner, but the control of this paddle and the balance of the weight is great for her. In a matter of a week, she loves using this paddle (we play a few days a week) vs. a couple of other ""el cheapo"" paddles. I give this a 5 star rating for entry players and players that play close and don't use alot of spin, but if you are a spinner and a deeper player, it is worth the extra few bucks to upgrade to the even better EuroTech."
4,A Good Value,"This paddle is a bargain here at Amazon. Sports stores would easily sell this for over $20. Having said that, I found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game. ""BUT"", I still eliminated many a younger player at our men's retreat. There's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear! Thanks, Stiga!"
1,Disappointing for its lack of performance content,"If you're looking for a video of Menuhin with any substantial amount of performance footage you'll be very disappointed in this video. Theres never more than a few seconds of Yehudi in performance. If you're looking for an in depth documentary on the life of this great violinist you'll also be sorely disappointed. There is no continuity and flow to the video. Yehudi's life story isn't really told in a cohesive and compelling way. It left me feeling as if I just saw a mish mash of music snippets with rambling commentary interspersed in between (or more accurately visversa) with no real sense of the whole story. I'd recommend the video ""The Art of the Violin"" as a far better produced alternative."
2,A One Sided View,"This series of interviews provides an interesting contrast to much of what we know of Yehudi Menuhin. At the time it was produced, I believe as a television program, Menuhin was a strong presence in Great Britain and his remarkable life was fairly well known. Mr. Palmer's work would seem to color his life with some disturbing psychological issues. One problem with the film is that Mr. Menuhin is continually being interrupted and cut-off. He can barely get a word in. Meanwhile discontented family members are interviewed at length and offer fairly negative views of Yehudi Menuhin's character. If this is the only place to learn about Yehudi Menuhin it would be a one-sided view. His rich life and accomplishments can be learned in his autobiography and a biography by Humphrey Burton. While this film is an interesting contrast to the full biographies, it would appear to be a distorted view if taken alone. Yes, and I'd love to have heard more music as well."
1,Don't buy this racial book.,"OK. Dear Mr. John Colvin we understand you. You may always think of Asian as an inferior one, as something (may be not even a human being for you) that could never match you in every aspects. But its not fair to do like this to one of the world greatest strategist in our time who eventually defeated the mighty Americans with superb morral and tactics."
3,This is a mediocre Ministry album.,"When I first played this all the way through, I was seriously dissapointed, but I wasn't expecting much after Dark Side of the Spoon (which is terrible). Filth Pig has 3 good songs and one is a cover song. Animositisomina is like that. There are 4 good songs, one is a cover song, and the rest can be ignored. The production value on this album is quite low and it is noticeable. This is yet another not so memorable album by Ministry. Just skip ahead to Houses of the Mole and Rio Grande Blood."
2,Weakest Ministry Album to Date,"I can't understand why Ministry fans are so gung-ho about this album for. They must be really desperate to make the exaggerated claims about this album being so heavy. The only good track on it, that actually sounds like a Ministry song, is the title track ""Animosity"" which is excellent. The rest of the album is rubbish and hardly what I expected from Ministry. Most of it doesn't even sound like Ministry. A complete disappointment - and that is coming from a die-hard Ministry fan. This album is so uniquely weak, it is even giving me second thoughts about seeing them live in concert this Spring in San Francisco."
2,Aweful - Ardent fans only.,"I like some Ministry albums, especially their early stuff, but this is just noise. It's almost as if the band is trying to play as heavy as possible but have lost substance and direction. I regret buying this and belive this album is really for the most ardent fans only."
2,not thier worst but far from thier best,"this is a pretty mediocre, id give it a pass and get land of rape n honey or paslm 69 or filth pig. if you have all those. save your money"
2,nothing lasts forever,"I think Animositisomina was just a little more of the same thing, if that makes any sence. In prior records ( cds nowdays ) there was a definate and distinct variation in style and theme. The Mind and Psalm 69 have unforgetable tracks like Burning inside, Thieves, New World Order, and Jesus Built my Hotrod (featuring lyrics provided by Butthole Surphers).unfortunatly, I was dissapointed with the lack of actual SOUND in this disk. I like to have at least a 60/40 mix of sound to noise in music. all and all, i just didn't like the lyrics, progression, or the lack of real message/theme continuity. Sorry folks, I think that they have come a long way from the '80's electronica hits, like Halloween, but somethings just need to fade out gracfully, so we can remember the glory and never have to think of ""the crappy later music."" take a bow and exit stage left."
4,Not sure why they wouldn't like this,"I liked this album just about as much as any other. It's got all the heavy stuff a Ministry fan could want, but it doesn't get boring or repetitive and I'm able to listen to this album more than once without pissing on it.Forty something good reviews versus 7 or 8 bad ones? Come on people, don't be so picky.I'm not sure how or why some fans wouldn't be able to get into this one. It *is* good.While I do understand why some fans don't consider this one to be a ""groundbreaking"" album, I can't say that it dissapoints based on sound or content. If you're looking for the usual (dare I say usual? Al and the rest of the team are always doing something new) Ministry stuff, this'll keep you satisfied. Unless you're going through some weird psycho delusional passive aggressive phase and can't decide whether or not you really like them."
5,Comeback Album!!!,"I was very, very surprised when I got this cd. I had almost given up on Ministry after ""Filth Pig"" and ""Dark Side of the Spoon"" but this caught me off guard. I put it on and the first few songs sounded like overly aggro thrash fits, then its sound starts to breathe and then it made sense. After a few listens I started to hear some similarities between this and ""The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste"". It's heavy and has a subconcious type atomsphere.It's not a rip-off of former glory as may be thought, but an album with it's own personality to it. I breathed a huge sigh of relief after hearing this. I was worried we lost Ministry to time, or whatever it is that tends to make great bands become a shadow of their former selfs. I was glad that this wasn't the case. Then a year later Al's Bush trilogy started and the band went out (?) on a high note!!"
2,Animostlynoise,"Good angry stuff here. A fair effort on that level, but I'm beginning to agree with people who think Ministry is starting to suck. They need to mix it up a little. ""Animosity"", ""Piss"", ""Broken"", ""The Light Pours Out of Me"", ""Shove"", and ""Stolen"" are the only tracks worth listening to."
5,"""I think he's breathing again""","I first bought Ministry's ""Greatest Fits"" at least a year ago and they've become one of my favorite bands. This album sounds a lot like ""The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste"", which is the best thing they could have Done. Some good songs to hear are ""Piss"" and ""Shove"", both have great mood and power. Best stuff from Ministry in awhile, highly recommended for those who like the new industial rock but haven't heard of its founder ::ahem::"
4,Ministry Was and Still is!,"I thought this band had called it quits, but the new album is even better overall than the last! These musicians never seize to amaze me. This record has more experimentations with the utilization of odd time signatures and they are doing it in such a way that it is not absolutely apparent to the listener. Don't get me wrong, this is still hard Ministry- full of anger which is how I like 'em! Hard Industrial is still there forte and nothing will top The Land of Rape and Honey, but they are back! I hope they tour again!!! Excellent spin!"
4,Thumbs up!!,"I don't know what to say other than this is a really good cd. Paul showcases excellent songwriting sensibilities while keeping his blazing guitar work prominently displayed. Some songs sound very punk influenced while others, were they promoted, could easily be Top 40 standards. If you've ever been a Paul Gilbert or Mr. Big fan, you should definitely check this one out."
4,in the top 50% of PG's discography,"Alligator Farm is the most '90s of Paul CDs, what with the punk/short song/strumming distorted rhythm guitar numbers. Still the disc also features slower numbers and long shreddy solos, insuring Aliigator Farm has a firm place in the op 50% of the guitarist's production. In sum not his best effort but a very enjoyable CD to pass time with."
2,An expensive home movie.,"Video quality of this DVD was extremely poor. The lighting was off, stagnant photography, and wonderfully grainy. This should have been a promotional free-bee for the Cairns area. You should have to pay the $3.95 S&H fee and be done with it. Appears a rental car group was in the production of this DVD but there were no obvious references to any car renting. Marginally informative on the Cairns area and attractions."
1,Haven't wasted my time yet,"Based on how terrible the 1st movie was, I haven't even opened this yet. Doubt I ever will. Double shame on me for buying this sequel."
3,Excellent in depth book on Aspect J,"I found the concepts of AspectJ cool but the book seems choppy and too complex to follow. The Eclipse AspectJ tools seem very complicated and busy on the screen. The book could have had a better flow and a lighter introduction. Possibly starting out as a ""language"" book versus a tool book."
2,Still waiting for book...,Still waiting for book that will tell me what Aspect Programming is good for. This one doesn't
1,Wrong book name,"Dear Sirs,This historical atlas is good for those who study the history of Central Eastern Europe. There are enough historical maps and texts for this small part of the Eastern Europe. The history of the biggest part of the Eastern Europe is simply not in. The Atlas excludes such countries as Russia and Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, Baltic States, Armenia, Georgia, etc. It is hard to understand why the authors of the atlas didn't include such a big part of the Eastern Europe into their work. Probably, they are not specialists.Therefore if you are really interested in Eastern Europe look for another historical atlas. Even good Historical Atlas of World History would be better."
1,Caution: card is oversold!,"While this card may work well in some older machines, the given description is inaccurate and insufficient.1) It is a two-port (not three-port) card. The external port is wired in parallel with one of the internal ports.2) It is not really an eSATA card. Yes, the external port has an eSATA connection. But the chipset does not properly support eSATA (hot insert and remove) protocol. If your external drive will always be attached, this card may work for you.3) It is not able to function in even five-year old PCI computers. After much pain, we were told the card requires its own interrupt (IRQ). The vast majority of PC's today share IRQ's across all PCI slots. None of our current computers could be configured to work with this card.If I had known any of these things ahead of time, I would have bought something different."
2,"Great illumination, poorly constructed","I already own two Tensor halogen lamps and have been very satisfied. The quality of the halogen illumination is great, especially for reading. But the construction of this lamp is disappointing. The shape of the base and the location of the switch on the base requires a sideways push to actuate. But the lack of weight in the base and the slickness of the plastic on its bottom means that it scoots away when the switch is pushed, when on a smooth surface such as a wood table. I had to buy thick rubber pads to stick on the bottom to solve the problem. Also the flexible gooseneck is lighter weight than on my previous Tensors and feels a bit flimsy. And the chrome flashing on the reflector started to bubble up once the lamp was turned on. Altogether, I would say this lamp was poorly thought out, designed more for looks than function."
1,Defective,I have hardly used this lamp for 30 hours in total. It stopped working abruptly. I even replaced the bulb with a new one but in vain. The lamp would not glow again!I contacted acehardware but they did not entertain my email even though this product carries a 1 year warranty.Very bad experience!
1,A Wall of Voodoo fan,"I love Wall of Voodoo, but this CD is unacceptable. The live tracks sound like it was recorded on a cassette tape that is very old. When I have a tape that sounds that bad, I throw it out, same with this CD. It now lives in the local dump."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"This movie was a little darker and at times depressing. It seemed to move slowly. For a Disney movie I was expecting it to be a little more upbeat, especially for my son and I to watch together. The baseball play was a little staged and not very authentic. It painted a fairly depressing picture of what living in Detroit is like (unfortunately it seemed to be accurate). I watched an old VHS version. It was an ""OK"" movie and I'm guess I'm glad I've seen it but there are a lot of much better baseball movies out there."
1,Poor Sound,"The content was a 10, hear me. OMG, IT WAS GREAT! It would have been awesome if you didn't have to continue to touch the volume up and down the entire duration."
2,Fadiman is Pompous and Dogmatic,This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them. Many of his judgements are simply wrong.
1,A tragic edition,"Stick with the second edition. This one has been revised for political correctness in the name of inclusion. The second edition spotlighted the Great Conversation of Western Literature, a written tradition of ideas discussed throughout the ages by top minds. Not because they were from a particular place or race, but because they had the preceding books in common. This is what sets Western Civilization apart, the continual evaluation of the same elemental ideas of existence. The current edition has turned this wonderful work into a list of ""good books"" by tacking in works that have much to offer, but were not in on the conversation."
5,Five Star Rating is Inadequate!,"Preston Blair is to Animation, what Einstein was to Physics,and what Christ was to Christianity.Never, has there been a more consice, understandable method for presentingthe secrets of Cartooning, Illustration, and Animation anywhere.Not at any price, not at any University, and not by anyone else. Ever.Blair's book""Animation"", originally sold for One Dollar, in every art supply store in America.Nearly every Animated Cartoon from the 1930's to Toy Story has felt his influence.No true Art Professional has Ever been without this book, nor wouldpart with that dog earred original copy purchased at the dawn of his training.For us, and al of Animation , there is the Sun, the Moon......and Preston Blair's ""Animation""."
3,The FELINES' FINAL CHAPTER,"As Midnight Panthers draws to a close, the action and storylines really heat up to an explosive conclusion. Not only that, but author/artist You Asagiri expands the storyline and characters into a whole new area that you wouldn't expect.While we, the readers, already know about a few of the characters' background we've yet to see Sonya's real background-and that is what we're finally treated to in Midnight Panther 4.There's a short story in the beginning taken place what appears to be feudal Japan, and we get to know about Sonya and what type of man she's attracted to. The second half of the book we get to understand her past a bit better. The end was well put together as it ties everything up without a lot of loopholes.All in all, this may have been my favorite of the 4 Panther volumes."
5,Unusual mother- daughter relationships,"The relationships of mothers and daughters in Bedford's novels are among the funniest and most complex than one can find in fiction. Her young characters are always uncanny mature, witty, independent but nevertheless unexpectedly vulnerable. Mothers, on the other hand, are difficult, lovable and unpredictable. Conflict is usually civilized, deep, and productive. Bedford is also very fond of Mediterranean settings, small towns in the cost of France or Italy, before they were spoiled by tourism. The description of the European life before WW2 is one of the many pleasures of this great book."
4,Little information but lots of pics,Little information for people that think the world of Che. However there are a couple interesting interviews with people that knew him and fought with him. Plus there are lots of pics that are published for the first time! I give it 4 stars because I would of loved more interviews and information. However the pics were appreciated :)
2,A Big Red Book for Revolutionaries,"""The Che Handbook"" is the coffee table book version of the Argentinian revolutionary's life. Gareth Jenkins and Hilda Bario have big,colorful pictures showing Che Guevara's impact on pop culture along with authentic photographs from his life. Che Guevara is depicted as a revolutionary, a lover, a son, a glorified secular Christ-figure. Che Guevara preaches idealism, an end to poverty, a socialist revolution.""The Che Handbook"" glosses over Guevara's atrocities. He is widely quoted and idolized by progressives, despite his heinous acts. Che Guevara attacked the ""bourgeoisie"",despite the fact he lived as one. His revolutionaries slaved while he drank his yerba mate and took numerous lovers. He persecuted artists, though artists now glorify him. Che persecuted religious people, but now he's been canonized by celebrities.""The Che Handbook"" turns the tyrannical terrorist into a secular saint."
3,Pretty Book!,"The dolls are great in this book, and it will be a great reference book that not only stimulates you visually, but helps you stretch your imagination for creating one-of-a-kind dolls yourself!"
4,Brilliant for the More Advanced Doll Maker,"I use this as a reference book. I also love to just sit in bed and read it as most other ""crafty"" dollmakers and craftspeople will understand. It's an inspiring book and well written, with good photographs and instructions. Its also good value for money. As an experienced doll maker I like it - I would not buy it for a beginner or to teach yourself ""how to"". Well, not unless you were a good sewer and used to some of the techniques involved. It is part of my core library of doll books,and a very good cloth doll book and there are not many of those."
1,Just Terrible!,"This Product is terrible....I went to the beauty supply store to get Kolestral by Wella and they didn't have it. But instead, they had Wella In-Depth. So, i figured i would just try it. IT WAS HORRIBLE...It was REALLY watery and didn't condition my hair at all. Not to mention, it made me break out in a rash on my neck. I don't know why they discontinued Kolestral. That was a better conditioner. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,Explores some of the why's of Colombias present situation.,"The conflict in Colombia isn t easily explained, or studied however this book may provide a first glance on Colombia, and mainly the why's of the present conflict. It invites to some reflection, which always turns out to be incredibly useful."
5,A masterpiece,Anyone attempting to decipher the complexities of the Colombian crisis must start with this text. It is comprehensive and objective.
3,Brief historical overview of Colombia,"The Making of Modern Colombia: A Nation in Spite of Itself was better named than written. For me, the writing style is a little awkward and the material to dense for such a short summary. I was left with a thousand facts but less understanding than i was hoping to glean.I would enjoy reading a follow-on book by David Bushnell that covers the last 20 years. Less time and more detail but with the advantage of his deep historical studies."
3,Interesting but ...,"The chapters dealing with Colombia's early history are fascinating but the later chapters, dealing with more recent events, seem to expose some of the author's own bias. Jenny Pearce's ""Colombia: Inside the Labyrinth"" provides a harder hitting analysis of modern Colombian politics. Bushnell's book is still worth reading for its analysis of the early centuries in Colombia -- the influence of which is being felt to this day."
3,Making Modern Colombia,"While in need of an update, David Bushnell's comprehensive and insightful review of modern Colombian history provides a solid grounding for anyone attempting to learn about or understand the complexities of Colombia."
2,"So far, so shallow","I was excited to read this book, but I'm having second thoughts after reaching the 2nd chapter. It has quite a few passages like: ""New Granada was different from Spain, not just in its topography and population makeup but in its economic functions and structure and its way of life"". This obviousness doesn't make for an insightful analysis that would differentiate the book from an account of chronological events. As there's a lot more to be found about Colombia's peculiar history in the 20th century and how it shaped its contemporary society, politics and economy, I can only hope the superficial tone of the book does not make me drop it while still in the 19th century. Hoping I can provide a better feedback - and a more positive one - shortly."
3,An adequate introduction to Colombia,"This book is an adequate introduction to Colombia for those people who currently only think that Colombia is a country full of cocaine dealers, vicious killers and leftist guerillas. This book is successful in putting these stereotypes in their proper places.My biggest complaint with this book is that it is a history of presidents, wars and important people; i.e., a traditional style of history.In order to dig deeper into the background behind the current situation in Colombia, I suggest people visit Human Rights Watch and pick up some of their reports on the human rights situation in Colombia. They are very enlightening, especially on the role of the US in Colombia's violence."
3,"Just OK, not that great...","Since there weren't any reviews on this yet, I thought I'd share my thoughts. It was cheap, so I thought I'd try it. And it's not bad. Most of the songs are relaxing background music. But most of them are just kind of blah, with kind of a of a new-age/jazz type of sound. You'll probably like some tracks and hate some others.Track 1 is repetitive jazz piano and is extremely irritating.Track 2-5 have a lot of violin and/or flute and have kind of a celtic or Irish sound, which I don't particularly care for.Track 6-10 are all fairly decent- more of a soft, relaxing melody and not as much of the new-age/jazz sound. Tracks 6 and 8 are my favorites, and are definitely worth keeping for your collection."
3,Just saw them live...,"I saw S.o.D. live a few nights ago. The live show was pretty weak- Duncan is gone and Lee just doesn't spew the filth and psychotic patter Duncan used to. (I've never seen them before, but I've heard the ""Two For The Show"" live album.)But the new tracks sound pretty good, particularly ""Machine Sex"". Everyone I was with was underwhelmed, but agreed they would probably pick up this album in the future."
2,"Down hill since ""Greatest Hits""","I thought they would have progressed in the last 10 years, but no. Nothing intersting or new here. One decent track, ""Streetwalker"", but they've done it better already. They really need some new sound, or producer or something....drugs perhaps."
4,Light and Right,"I was looking for a T-shirt that would be very thin and lightweight. This one fits the bill, and at a cheap price."
2,Not what I anticipated,The dimensions are correct but it is very thin. It is about the same thickness (padding) as a thin down comforter. This is more of a topper than a bed.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this pet bed. It was very flat and flimsy and did not really fit in our dog crate. Our dog only slept on this about a week before I got rid of it.
5,works works well,"In addition to selling this product, we use it to transport our dog around and it is very sturdy."
5,Just what I thought it would be,Matches description exactly. Love it and so do my dogs! I needed something I could wash in the washer and also comfy for my animals.
1,Not plush!,Don't waste your money if you are looking for something plush. This is more like a mat. We had to purchase something else with more cushion.
2,probably wouldnt get it again,"for the price I paid, I should have gotten the dog gone smart brand, this was not as plush as the pic shows, after a couple of months its flat already......"
5,Wonderful,"When we brought Noelle home she got sick and we had a mess to clean. This was so easy to wash and it came out just as if it was brand new. It is something our baby loves. It is so cute to watch. She has a bed on it and she actually sleeps on this and under the bed we have on top of it. So if you wonder if you should get it don't hesitate to get it because it is as wonderful as it looks and was told. I will be getting another one soon as a backup while washing this one. So Noelle if she could speak would say thanks I love it.Love,Paulagene and Noelle"
5,Fits very nicely in the dog crate.,"Just got a ""new"" and very large dog. Had to buy a bigger dog crate and this pad is just perfect for the crate"
3,Sounds OK... not much more,"I had higher expectations from this set... these speakers deliver decent bass sound but yet, the drivers look and sound like automotive quality speakers. Same size generic Chinese in wall speakers from Amazon sound to me a bit better... but the price of these was low enough to make them suitable for a modest quality setup."
1,The only book I couldn't finish this year!,Pedantic. That is the one word which best describes this work. There are many sources where you can find more lucid explanations of these concepts where you won't have to wade through the old testament sentence structure. It is not a bible and it does no justice to Einstein.
4,"Lots of good information, not so good format.","I'm about half way through this book, my initial feelings about it are very good, there is a LOT of good information. My only issue with the book is the text formating. Everything is stated (or seems to be stated) as a fact. And this is in contradiction with some of refrences that this book makes within. (Science is indeed evoloving and changing constantly, new information is added all the time that changes our preception of the world.) If your intrested in a ton of great information, read it, the constant biblical wording could get annoying and make it a sometimes difficult read."
5,Midwest Viewpoint,"One of my favorite music sites gave this CD a top rating, and their description of it was mouth-watering, so I picked it up a good month after it came out.My first listen left me very disappointed. The only tracks I liked were Chicago Typewriter and Miami Device, and the last track irritated me, as I had expected metal, not jazz.Alas, the years roll on, and I aged a little. Now, this CD is my pride and joy. Tears roll down my face every time I hear the spastic blasts of frantic saxaphone wailing in Vergasso, and the groove-laden thrash of TMS is cathartic. 0100011110011 has become my meditation hymn, and has inspired many a brilliant piece of writing, with its infinite depth and droning darkness. Yakuza has crafted a recording that is not only incredibly unique and head-bangingly satisfying, but a true piece of intellectual stimulation."
3,wow,"I'll have to agree with former reviewers who said it isn't avantgarde and/or ""all that""--I reaalllly wanted to be inpressed b/c I know the work of some of these guys, but it failed to ""wow"" me inspite of that. It tries hard, but doesn't seem to come from an authentic place enough to call it avantgarde. Technically, of course it's real good, but the big picture doesn't feed the listener anything but droning, rumblings and rarely blossoms into anything magnificent or fleshed out. I wish it would've made me care, I was so tempted to give it 4 stars just because I know the quality of talent...Maybe next time..."
2,atleast she's pretty...?,"dinah can't sing; i remember the day whenever i brought surf bat (the only instrumental track on the whole album) in for my guitar lessons and she didn't finish singing the first line of riboflavin whenever my instructor paused the CD and says ""she's not very good at singing."" her voice is irritating as hell, and there isn't very much special in terms of lyrics or musicality with this group. two stars instead of one because the band has some musicians that could play such as rikk agnew. if you consider yourself a deathrocker of course you'd buy this CD, if you collect CD's for the sake of collecting, get this one, you like singing along to corny lyrics, get this CD, if you like everything rozz williams go ahead and buy this, if you listen to really bad punk already this won't be far fetched, but if you're looking for talent skip this. to be quite frank if it weren't for christian death performing with 45 grave all those years back, would anyone care?"
3,Blondie puts out a Halloween album.,"This is a very cheesy ""goth"" pseudopunk type album. But I got it because I figured it would be a good companion to the Return of the Living dead soundtrack, which it is. Its not the style that makes it average, but the fact that only half the songs are good. The ""School's Out"" cover sucks, not because they did a bad cover but because that song is always bad. Worth getting, though. Has some nice and unusual touches."
5,JimJN,"I have not commented on Deborah Coleman's other CDs although they too are excellent. But after I bought her new one ""Soft Place to Fall"" I had to add my 2 cents. This is easily one of the best, and freshest Blues CD releases to come out in a long, long time. On this outing she has also managed to do something few Blues performers have ever accomplished; on several songs she has successfully merged Blues with a somewhat more contemporary sound. It adds a level of real excitement and freshness to this effort. On this CD, Deborah and her band really display their talents and serve up a full sound of polished, infectious rhythm that cannot be denied. There is plenty of traditional Blues and guitar leads here as well. This time out Deborah leaves no doubt (if there ever was any) that she is a Blues Woman Extraordinaire. You can't go wrong with this CD."
1,Not like the picture,"It's pretty, but it's not like in the picture. The two rings don't fit together, so there's a big gap. Not for me."
3,Great value for price,"I bought this ring and was skeptical, but I've been proven wrong, it's lasted really well, and I get compliments all the time. It's a great every day ring."
4,Exciting Story,"Christine did a wonderful job of telling one very important and interesting story from several perspectives, many interesting characters, and a few destinations. From Jamaica, to Florida to Brooklyn I was interested from beginning to end."
4,A GOOD GROWTH,"BEING A RESIDIENT HERE OF DC YOU CANT HELP BUT KNOW ABOUT THIEVERY. IVE BECOME HUGE FANS OF THIERS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. I WAS VERY EAGER FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS CD BUT WAS A LIL DISSAPOINTED WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO IT. DONT GET ME WRONG I NOTICED THE GROWTH RIGHT OFF BUT IT WASNT CLASSIC TC. ONCE I OPENED MY EARS A LITTLE MORE, AND LISTENED TO THE CD A FEW MORE TIMES ,I REALIZED HOW GOOD THIS DISC REALLY IS. IT HAS A BROADER WORLD APPEAL AND THE WRITING HAS AGOTTEN BETTER. THE PRODUCTION IS STILL SLICK AND POLISHED. A GOOD CD FOR TEA AT HIGH NOON..HA!"
5,To create the perfect mood...,"""Boring"". That's what most of instrumental music haters say when listening to something in this style, specially in Brazil, land of beat based music. This CD is different, it starts slowly, grows and gets everyone in the mood for...well, You'll know when You see it. ""From Creation"" and ""Omid(hope)"" are my top picks. If you like the duo, expect nothing less than excellency. This one and the new Massive Attack CD never leave my car and my room."
4,Essential to chillin out,"Anyone who's listened to Thievery Corp.'s other albums would easily pick-up on the distinct, beautiful style that embodies each and every album they've created, and their talents only escalate through The Richest Man in Babylon. It blew me away how different and unique every track was from the one before it. A CD you can chill to anytime, anywhere and listen to it all the way through in fear of skipping a beat. It's truly an incredible album."
4,"Oh it's good, it's really good.","First off, the notable tracks:Heavan's gonna burn your eyesfacing eastall that we perceivesimple histoire - GORGEOUS vocalsrichest man in babylonresolutionthat may not sound like a lot, but I like those songs the most for their true production quality and the feel good vibe you get from listening to them. They're great tracks and the others are good too, but i don't consider them notable.These have a defined sound. no question, listen to their other cd's, you can instantly recognize them. I like that, they stick to what they know and do it well - it helps that very few have the sound that they create. Various influences on this one, many are arabic which is hard to mix into downtempo tracks. They do it though, and oh yeah, they're very good."
5,(**************),Great original tunes........Appreciate being able to find this cd on the internet. No good music stores withing 100 miles.Thanks
2,Everything but the Girl goes corporate.......,"Organic? I suppose this means including real instruments guitars, horns, piano-in the mixx. This actually happens on Babylon, it also involves some Jamaican toasting/dancehall except everything is REAL downtempo. Best track by far is All That We Perceive. Avoid playing this cd in your ride it's better than Nytol..."
3,GOOD,"I'm not a big Thievery fan, I've owned several of their albums and have been to a few shows. I USED to be blown away from their earlier shows, nowadays it's just too much, lights, effects, big venues, and guests artists etc. But I must say, this is Thievery at their best."
2,Hmmmmmmm,"After being blown away by Thievery Corporation time and time again, I must say that I was greatly anticipating this new album. Unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. There are numerous musicians out there who are opening new doors and experimenting with new forms and styles of music (ex. Tosca, Alex Cortiz...) What I've heard from Theivery in the past is a mix between world music styles and new age downtempo/acid beats. They seem to have stepped too far into the wrelm of world music without keeping an equal balance of incredible laid back grooves. Sorry guys I'd have to say this ones a bust."
2,Ugh!!!! I was robbed!!!!,"After listening to this CD I feel I was robbed by the Thievery Corporation. I only really like 2 songs which were Omid(Hope) and All that we Perceive. There were a few others which were decent to listen to, but nothing other than those two that were memorable. For a CD to get more than a 3 from me, it has to come with something that is pretty memorable. This effort provides nothing of the sort. It does have a lot of influences from other cultures, but they must have taken the bad instead of the good. This CD isn't much to write home about let alone to someone else. Don't waste your time...."
4,Unanticipated flights,"I first listened to The Richest Man in Babylon during a half-day flight across two continents and two oceans. My Ipod kept the album in constant rotation. Worlds passed by as did the musical genres masterfully mixed by The Thievery Corporation. Clouds. Skies. Beats. The album, despite certain negative reviews in web blogolandia, brilliantly captures the impressive depth of travel that is occasioned by passing through the worlds of musical genre (rather than ""world music"") when sequentially articulated through the beats that accentuate such diverse vitalities together. For me, listening to The Richest Man in Bablyon retains the distinctive sensation of flying -- the pleasure of travel, the knowledge of going elsewhere, and the sensation of intimate dependence upon the techno-logical world that carry our faith and dreams. Romanticist sentiments? Hardly. Just a reflection of the worldiness of our times. Check it out for yourself."
4,Interesting World fusion sound,"Nice use of various reggae, arabesque music and horns with electronica beats. Some of the vocals are soothing. Otherwise nothing really pops out at me.I just bought a new disc of new electic groove music calledParis Under A Groove at Tower Records in Vegas. It has some downtempo, jazz electro, underground club grooves, trip hop, electro, drum and bass, house. This album has it all and St Germain's rare classic. I am chillin with this on all the time now in my car. Great tracks and hard jazz grooves. A complete package."
5,Chill out!,"Looking to chill out and lay low? This is just the album to do that, with its incredible mix of jazz, samba, bossa nova, reggae, and many other beats that meld into songs of ambience and open-mindedness. Lean back, relax, and enjoy!"
3,a personal opinion,Nice tunes but somehow not as funky as I thought - would want to listen to someone who knows the best of their music and what they recommend.
2,More from the downtempo factory,"When the downtempo scene emerged a half dozen years back, Thievery Corp, as well as K&D and Tosca and Peace Orchestra and many others were an exciting new blend of easy grooves and delicious textures. Always lurking, though, was the question of where the sound would go next., how it would evolve. The answer for Thievery Corp is: nowhere special. Richest Man in Bablylon, like Toca's dissapointing new disc, Dehli 9, sounds like their earlier work, sans the inspiration that made albums like Thievery's 1999 disc *Abductions and Reconstructions* and Tosca's *Opera* classics.My guess is that a year from now people who buy this disc will find they're back to listening to older Thievery, having traded *Richest Man* in at a used bin."
3,the plug stinks,"I've had this speaker/radio for my Ipod Nano for about six months. I got it for around $50 at JC Penney on sale. My problem with it is that every time I touch it, the plug-in wire in the back of the radio comes unplugged, so I lose my time on the clock and it's very tiresome. I'm going to use it in a spot that I don't need a clock and then buy a replacement after I've done a little research. I though $50 was a good deal for this but knowing what I now know, it was too much because I hate resetting the clock so much. All other functions work well."
2,"DreamGear i.Sound Dreamtime Alarm Clock, Radio, iPod Player","The sound is average; not bad to use for an alarm clock but not great for quality listening. Also, the cord easily disconnects from the back. Had to tape the cord to the back so that it would not come off. Bad design. All in all, decent product for the price."
4,lid problem,"My 2 qt lid did not fit. It would be nice if they sold each item separately for replacement purposes. I was happy with the color, style and the other items in the set."
3,Returned,I returned these canisters because they were MUCH darker than pictured on-line and on the product box. They were closer to a dark chocolate brown. Also they had a rolled lip inside that any product put into them could build up in time making a mess.
2,Not as good as appears,"I purchased these after searching online for a good set of cannisters to go on a shelf in our newly renovated kitchen. They look good. The knobs on top have to be put on. When I went to do this the screw that is to hold the knob on the cannister is screwed into the botom of each knob. They are very hard to remove. The tops of the slotted screws were in such bad shape they were hard to remove. Then the screws were not even long enough to catch enough of the threads in the knob to attach them. I had to go to a hardware store to purchase screws. They look nice as a decoration but do not seal enough to be funtional. If there had been a toll free number enclosed, I would have called to complain. I do not reccommend."
4,Looks great,"These canisters look great and the lids provide a tight seal. The only drawback would be that the paint along the edge of the lids flakes off. So if you're using the canisters to store coffee, sugar, etc...you will need to sand the paint off so it doesn't flake into your food."
3,Old Dutch Canister Set,"The Old Dutch Canister set is very attractive. I've had several comments. However, be very careful what you store inside as they will rust. Also, one lid is very tight and could pull out. If you want them just for their appearance, they will serve you well."
3,Antiqued Copper Canisters,Attractive. Well made. Way too small for use intended. Lids do not fit snuggly enough to keep contents fresh.
1,Not suitable for food storage,"I received this canister set as a gift. They are not suitable for food storage. The black coating on the inside flakes off and mixes with food contents. I do not consider these canisters safe for food storage. Old Dutch International should remove these canisters from their product list. As mentioned in other reviews, lids do not have a seal and are very difficult to remove, frequently causing spillage of contents. Canisters are no longer in use in my home and are not suitable for donation. Discarding is the best option."
5,So pretty,"I ordered this set to use for all the doggie treats I buy. Works great, looks good, and keeps the treats fresh."
4,Pretty,I bought these with an Amazon gift card from my sister when I moved into my new house. I really like these canisters. I have had them for over a year now and still love them. I have read reviews from some people who didn't like that the lids do not have seals. I use plastic zip lock bags in mine - I find that keeps the canisters from needing frequent washings and solves the problem of not having a seal. They sure look pretty on my counter top.
2,Lid does not fit,The lid for the 2nd largest canister did not fit. I had to return the item. So much for this Mother Day gift!!
1,Poor Quality- Would NOT Recommend!!,"These are beautiful canisters; however, the tops on 2 of them were so tight you couldn't get them off without spilling sugar all over the room. We had to use pliers to make them fit which damaged the tops. They are also NOT air-tight. There is no seal. After using them for a couple of months now, we are finding flecks of the black paint on the inside in our sugar and flour. YUCK!! They have turned out to be complete waste of money which is very disappointing because I searched far and wide for beautiful, functional canisters. I will continue my search. :("
1,very disappointed,I am very disappointed with this set.They are very pretty but the lids fit so tight u can't open them.
5,fun book and in great condition,Received the book in a timely matter and it was in great shape. It was also in English. Kept finding the book in Spanish but not in English. Amazon had it both ways. It is a very entertaining book. Written sort of like some tv shows a movies as a mock documentary. very fun.
4,Fun soothing music,"This album is great to study to, but it can put you in a trance if you let it. I like the beginning of the CD better than the end. It gets a little weird toward the end."
4,playful,"this album is full of what can only be described as whimsy. incongruous sounds are woven into fun and beautiful tunes, all with a great backbeat. i didn't know what i was getting into when i bought it but i love it for it's uniqueness. infinitely listenable."
3,A album over done in this modern world,I would have enjoyed this album if I had heard it a few years earlier. This type of music has appeared so often over the past few years with such bands as Bentley Rhythm Ace and other groups attached to the Skint label. I was most impressed by the outstanding colourful artwork surrounding this music.
2,DEFINITELY - The Most Over-rated Album Of 2001,"Although I can appreciate the novel nature of this recording and the work that went into its superior production, after all is said and done it just dosen't move me - it has no soul. Moreover, it can't even be considered as background music because it is too flowery - so what we have here is looped boredom and shear mediocrity."
2,samples are so awful,"this album would be brilliant except for one thing...awful, song-length vocal samples. no singing, just crappy ""look what we found digging in the record bins, aren't we clever and obscure?"" samples that drone on for 6 or 8 minutes over what would otherwise be great music. hey, guys, this isn't 1988 anymore. we're not all impressed by samples culled from preacher/jazzercise/french language instruction/learn to tune your hi-fi records anymore.lord knows i don't mind a sample but less is more.if that kind of thing doesnt bother you, though, then by all means pick up this hugely overrated disc, along with the other most overrated record of 2001: the avalanches' 'since i left you."" ugh...another tedious sample fest..otherwise give it a pass and pick up much better downtempo releases from tosca, peace orchestra, fila brazillia, etc."
3,Reconstruction Time,"Just what is the point of a review which says ""don't buy it"".I mean Harold Arlen's songs have always attracted rock & pop stars and after Patti La Belle & the Bluebelles' radical revival of Over The Rainbow in the 60s anything goesStormy Weather has been done by at least a dozen doowoppers including the 5 Sharps whose original single is supposed to be the most valuable in the World because only a few copies exist.In the 80s Stormy Weather was revived by Richard Jobson of the Skids-probably an acquired taste but there you goPersonally I could have done without the appalling Jimmy Scott who appears twice yet there must be 1000s of covers of Arlen songs more worthy .Fortunately you can disable stuff today you don't like if you play the CD on Media Player"
1,APPALLING - DON'T BUY IT.,"I adore the music of Harold Arlen and was very excited by my purchase BUT this CD is going back to the CD store tomorrow. It is quite possibly the worst collection of attempts at singing I have ever heard. You don't have to wait long for it to get bad either - the first song is simply dreadful. To mention just a couple - Rufus Wainwright sings like he has huge marbles in his mouth, being almost indecipherable, slurring all the singing and generally destroying the enormous talent of Mr Arlen. Deborah Harry is a cool and sexy pop artist but cannot sing jazz, misses most of her notes (I know jazz isn't about being note perfect but this is painful to listen to). To make these recordings and then sell them to the public under the guise of talent is a slap in the face to all lovers of Arlen and jazz. BUY SOMETHING DIFFERENT."
4,Excellent Reference,"Excellent book, clean, slimmed definitions, therefore making it concise, and does what it is supposed to do: Provide a breadth of knowledge and be a good reference. Buy this if you are a chemistry major, or are in the field of chemistry."
3,The management of (limited) contruction...,"I am surprised that the project samples are only limited with pipelines.In a world of shopping mall, high rise residence and office tower contructions, none of these projects exist in this book.Buy it only if you are in pipeline construction...!"
2,What have I got here?,"Jacob Burckhardt is one of the greatest of historians - perhaps second only to Thucydides. History would not even be counted as a science without him. I therefore eagerly looked forward to this book.I can only assume that I have been presented with a fifth-rate unacknowledged abridgment of his masterpiece. The proofreading is appalling, the paragraphs appear to have been jerked out of context, and there is no publishing history. Is 'Hardpress.net' some sort of rip-off agent?Is there any form of recompense for this sort of misrepresentation? When I buy a book, I expect it to approximate to the original edition or to contain some acknowledgment as to why it doesn't.The portions that I can read are wonderful - thank you Professor Burckhardt. Or perhaps I am completely wrong, and this sort of scherzo style is what Nietzsche admired so much. I can't believe it!"
4,"Canada's Unsung ""Bronte"" Sisters","I cannot believe that these women are not as well known in Canada as the Bronte's are in the UK and are not part of the high school curriculum's reading list. They are part of Canada's early ""literati"". These talented literary sister's story is an amazing, touching, even inspiring story of our early pioneering women who faced unbelivible hardship in an unforgiving enviorment of the backwoods with only the hap hazard support (at least in finacial terms) of their husbands. Their struggle gives testament to the early european immigrants who had none of the support enjoyed today and faced a much harsher enviorment. Their spirit is to be admired by any new Canadian immigrant and a eye opener for the rest of us."
3,"Better than the 1st book in the trilogy, waiting for the 3rd","At last, a series for the Rifts universe. While many people critiqued the first book for having printing errors in it, the second does not appear to have any of these problems. If anything; the second book in this trilogy leaves me wanting to read more (which is good).......Our heros have been betrayed and now are getting ready to be sent out to the wilderness on a suicide mission again! Oh My! Hopefully the next book will have a bit more combat action in it (both magic and conventional). A good read so far if you like Rifts, but not necessarily a must have Sci-Fi set of material."
4,THE TIMBERCRUISERS,I LIKE THIS BOOK FOR IT'S SIMPLE ABILITY TO PORTRAY ED van ZEELANDS FEELINGS AND OBSERVATIONS AS A NEW IMMIGRANT. LIFE IS A LEARNING PROCESS AND THE AUTHOR TAKES YOU THRU THE BEGINNINGS OF A NEW JOB IN BRITISH COLUMBIA FROM THE COAST TO THE INTERIOR OF B.C. AND INTRODUCING YOU TO A WHOLE HOST OF CHARACTERS THAT HE HAS WORKED WITH FROM BEGINNING TO END WITH LOVE INTERESTS THROWN IN. THIS BOOK IS A STUDY OF HOW PEOPLE HANDLE HARD WORK AND JUST MAKE THE BEST OF A GIVEN SITUATION. THERE ARE SOME VERY COMICAL SAYINGS AND SITUATIONS. OVERALL I LIKE THE BOOK AS IT IS A NICE EASY READ.
5,Heaven!,"I have an incredibly wide foot and I've searched and searched for shoes that would provide the right cushion and support, especailly in the forefoot. These shoes are THE shoes for me! The toebox is very roomy and the cushioning material is simply top notch. This is my fourth try for shoes and I'm finally happy. If you're a heavier runner who needs a nice cushion for your forefoot, these are THE shoes for you!"
5,"Hot, frozen, or straight from the box....Yummmm!","I enjoy Kellogg's Pop-Tarts Chocolate Vanilla Creme hot, frozen, or straight from the box. Easy to eat on the go, which is most of the time for me. They're just sweet enough and I still crave them even after devouring a few boxes by myself. As another reviewer stated, I haven't burnt out on these as quickly as other products. Unlike other reviewers, I had not searched everywhere for these prior to my order from Amazon....but I have since observed that they are not available locally. Shipping was quick, arrived in good condition, and with expiration dates several months down the line....but they won't make it anywhere near that long! (I ordered them on an Amazon special and will order when they go on sale again.)"
5,Good news - they're back!,"These were my favorite flavor of Pop Tarts, so I was really disappointed when Kelloggs stopped making them. Well, good news! As of July 2010, they are back on the shelves with a new name - Ice Cream Sandwich. I've tried the Cookies and Cream flavor, but they're not the same. Similar, but not the same. But Ice Cream Sandwich IS!"
3,Feelin Hot,I was a little disappointed in this CD. Not what I expected it to be. Too bad I could not listen to some of it before I ordered it.
5,great Pom resource,"This is a great book to describe the basics of living with your pom. The author has a friendly tone and seems to have a lot of experience with poms of her own. It really reviews everything you need to know...training, feeding, grooming...the works! I just adopted a two year old dog and this book is great because it doesn't focus on the puppy years only. It addresses that time well, but gives wonderful overall advice. Great buy!"
2,Totally agree with Roxanne F's review,"While I did enjoy the movie in a low key way, I found everything Roxanne F said in her review to be true. And the ending was badly done. I felt as if Amir was thrown with the friend's sister, sort of like a teenager being made to attend a dance with his mother's friend's icky daughter. The problem wasn't the actors themselves, but the writing."
4,Easy to set up and use -,"I used 1 wireless mic and 3 wired mics, only issue was related to mic sensitivity, and I dont think it's related to this unit."
4,Not From Master Tapes!,"This is a great album, but the people at Spitfire got the recordings from an LP> Listen to the opening claps from ""The Kids Are Back"" and hear the pops and surface noise! My advice, get the Atlantic CD which is not from vinyl. Get on the ball Spitfire!"
1,...But you can stop Twisted Sister,"Apparently rock 'n roll can be stopped, cuz these guys didn't even last 'till the mid 80s. Then again, they weren't really rock 'n roll, but rather, just a bunch of clowns who made Tipper Gore angry.See ya' later, MR. SISTER"
2,"Ah, the 80's . . .","In a fit of 80's hair-band metal nostalgia, I bought this album for a few tracks I remembered liking. As it turns out the first three tracks are cool and had me cranking it up. Sadly, the rest of it is total crap and the bonus tracks are no bonus."
3,GREAT MUSIC! PATHETIC SOUND!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the greatest metal albums ever recorded, which is the only reason I gave it a 3 instead of a 1, because the sound is PATHETIC!!!!!!! I have the analog, & I'm having a hard time telling the difference between the 2. In fact, the analog may sound better!!!!! If you like Twisted Sister 0r good metal, then you should own a copy of this album. BUT, DON'T be expecting a first class 24 bit remaster!!!!"
4,Sister....as in Twisted!,"When it came time to load up my i-pod, lo and behold, I took 8 of the 10 tracks from this album. Hence a review was deemed necessary. Twisted Sister were never a virtuoso band but they paid their dues in the 70s and learned how to crank out good quality metal. YCSRR has plenty of good riffs, decent solos, and the vocals of one Dee Snider. I always loved the first three rockers- The Kids Are Back, Like A Knife In The Back, Ride To Live, Live To Ride. But there are other good songs like We're Gonna Make It and I've Had Enough. The cover of The Who's I Am (I'm Me) and the ballad You're Not Alone are also good. And let's not forget the title track. I often feel the need to give the two-fingered Dio sign come chorus time, YOU CANT STOP ROCK N ROLL!"
4,"before they got Hungry,and before they came out and played!","This is kinda the ""Forgotten"" TS album,but a very good one!Every track is good,I think The Kids are Back,and the title cut,stick out as the class of the CD,but there is some other good stuff on this album as well,check it out,you won't regret the purchase!Check out their ""Come out and Play"" album,also,if you like the Sister,in my opinion,that is the best Twisted album EVER!But again this album ""You Can't Stop..."" REALLY ROCKS!,and will delite Hard Rockers Galore!"
4,TS at their best,"To me, this album was Twisted Sister's best. It represents the band's raw power before their commercial success."
4,Good Video for Any Swimmer,"This brilliant video breaks down Roland's stroke in great detail and gives you points you can easily implement into your own swim practice. I also loved the bonus features showing his favorite drills and his turns and breakoffs.On the plus side, I'll mention excellent underwater slow motion footage this video provides.On a minus side, the background tune repeats itself for an hour and becomes really irritating after a few minutes. I wish there was a variety to the music or an option to turn it off somehow."
4,WWII Era Black & Whites,"If you enjoy anything and everything WWII, you will enjoy this set. I'd give it 3 stars, due to the picture quality of the films, but the content is great. What can you expect from movies filmed during the war. This set was a great addition! Sit down and enjoy."
4,Great for old guys from WWII era,"I gave this video and one of the other big war collections to my 80 year old Dad. He is having the time of his life. The poor quality (I warned him ahead of time) has not bothered him in the slightest.If you are looking for a gift for the old guy, and he likes war movies, this is the real deal."
4,Good old days,"Interesting window into the role of film in WW2; the propaganda is a bit more subtle than one might expect, and there is hope for a peaceful post-war world."
5,Brilliant uptempo Blues from the master,"This album is fantastic! It has great uptempo blues jams to boogie to, as well as the classic heart breaking stories that blues master Magic Slim tells.""Key To Your Door"" is a great track in the classic blues genre, and ""Shake It"" has that great blues shuffle made so popular by SRV's ""Pride And Joy."" Slim's ""Please Don't Dog Me"" and the instrumental (almost) title track ""Snakebite"" are classic jams as well.But the stand out track is ""Lump On Your Stump"" which is a fun play on lyrical rhyming, guitar rhythms, and funky drums. You gotta listen to this song! Just great stuff that will get your feet tappin' and your lips movin'.This album is a great record to drive to or have playing at your backyard BBQ. Magic Slim is a master and doesn't get the recognition he deserves (outside Chicago that is). He's brilliant. As he says on this album: ""And you know that, man."""
4,"Solid, if not spectacular read","Ms. Pickens has written an enjoyable Regency romp with intelligent, sympathetic characters. Both the hero and heroine are imperfect yet extremely likeable. As the relationship develops, Ms. Pickens demonstrates how the heroine matures and the hero heals past wounds. The plot (governess and lord of the manor fall in love) was thin and familiar, but that isn't that a common problem with genre works?"
4,Another good story,"The story was totally unbelievable, but I enjoyed it anyway.I don't have anything else to say about this book."
2,meh,"I was expecting greatness to tell you the truth. Different strokes for different folks. I like both instant pleasures and rough diamonds. Unfortunately for me, I have yet to see/hear the brilliance. It never takes me anywhere, and I like SIGUR ROS and G.S.Y.B.E., therefore I do have the patience."
5,A prizewinning debut novel by a well known music writer,"It is no wonder that this witty, Borges-ian first novel won a prestigious Australian book prize. Griffiths' clear and approachable style is superbly suited to such a thought provoking work, but he never seems to talk down to the reader as he discusses weighty subject matter in a lighthearted manner. I really enjoyed reading this; I preferred it to his second novel, The Lay of Sir Tristan, which was less open in spirit, but I would certainly buy any other works by the same author, and his column in the New York Times always has an interesting perspective on the classical music scene."
5,A very diverse region,"As an American born Muslim who has lived and worked in the Middle East as a strategy consultant, Aamir Rehman is able to bring a cross-cultural perspective to his subject. In 300 concise pages, he brings the GCC countries alive, and helps the reader understand how different they are to each other.I took three key messages away from this book:(1) The intense demographic and political challenges the smaller GCC countries face, with tiny domestic populations and large communities of non-citizen expatriates.(2) The story is not just oil, with signficant diversification efforts being made across the GCC.(3) The cultural differences between the states, with restrictive Saudi Arabia and ultra-liberal Dubai being at the two extremes.I recommend this book to anyone interested in international business; as Aamir says, the GCC is too important to ignore."
5,Great Book! A must for the business person looking to Dubai to expand their market,A great read! If you fly to Dubai you can read it on the plane...you will have at least 15 hours to kill :) A great read that will be worth your time.
3,Tell me what,Assembling own delusions akin a sort of religious exploration of a human soul mounting to Jesus Christ's endeavours is a hardly understandable story comprehended just with reading the filmmaker's comments appearing under a wide-format screening simultaneously.Not much to lose if not spending a hip of money on this DVD.
1,Blu ray region not stipulated on sale of item,Excellent movie what I can remember because I can't play it in our region and the type of disk was not clear at the point of sale which is very disappointing
2,I wish I didn't spend so much $,"Being a HUGE fan of Santa Sangre I bought this movie on a whim. Although it was entertaining and much of what I expected a film by Alejandro Jodorowsky to be, I think $22 was too much to pay. In hindsight I would have been satisfied had I paid $10."
2,What the heck did I just watch??,"Welcome to the most bizarre movie ever made. Or, at least, the weirdest movie that I have seen, and being a fan of indie and foregin films, I've seen some doozies. But this one is heads and shoulders (or severed head and shoulders, if you will) above the rest. Even the previous most bizarre film I had ever seen - Sweet Movie - was blown away by this film in terms of sheer weirdness and discontinuity.I would go along with the ""see it on drugs"" recommendation. I am giving it two stars instead of one because it looks good (love the set in the opening scene), and because I was very impressed with the climbing-the-obelisk scene. Apart from that, I just found the storyline to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too artsy for my tastes, plus there were some disturbing scenes with dead animals and too many limbless (or partially limbless) people running and/or hobbling around."
2,Embarassed to have bought this,"This should never be shown to non-adults and even then very selectively. The worst scene is this frog scene where all these frogs are killed, maybe 100 of them. It was so gruesome and I want to block it out. The rest was so oversexed and disgustingly crude and felt twisted. I gave two stars because the criterion commentaries helped me cope with it and try to understand it (but I still am unforgiving about the frogs-so unnecessary). It was actually about astrology and stuff. It was from the 70s I think, and so part of it was the tacky times possibly? One time was enough for me though!1-22-2013 I mentioned this movie was criterion, but its actually not criterion..."
1,What the hell....?,"It is hard to beleive this cuts it as a ""movie"". About 15 minutes into the film, I was already wondering how long the ""movie"" was. I have never witnessed anything so unbeleivably ridiculous and random. Imagery? Symbolism? I beleive the word you're looking for is garbage. It's a bunch of scenes thrown together and made to look like it's something really intricate, when in reality nothing in the film makes one ounce of sense. Halfway through the film, suicide started to sound better and better with each passing minute. This ""movie"" will be the brunt of many jokes among myself and the friend I watched it with for years to come. Utter garbage, people."
1,The Best of the Worst,"This short review has nothing to say about the work of Criterion putting this movie in HD format. This review does have to do with the movie itself.I like strange movies. I like David Lynch movies, so I figured this would be a movie I might enjoy. Boy, was I wrong.This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched.I thought I might have liked it until it reached the 30 minute point, and then it lost me.It's funny how I feel I SHOULD have liked it, but it was not to be."
3,Why the different rating?,"I first encountered this film on laserdisc in a Japanese print which ""fuzzed out"" sexual body parts. The film, however, was rated ""NotRated."" Then I finally found the Anchor Bay DVD (in the boxed set of Jodorowsky films) and the film, again, was rated ""Not Rated."" Now Ipurchased the blu-ray edition of the film, again from Anchor Bay, and it is rated ""R."" As this is not a film I watch on an regular basis -and not one that I want to watch twice in a night to see if there is any difference between the R and Not Rated versions - I am just wonderingif anyone has seen both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions and can tell me if there is a major difference. And, I do wonder why the change inratings as both versions are listed at the same running time and presented by the same distributor, Anchor Bay.Just a thought!As to the movie - most the the reviews are spot on, so I will not add anything here. But, still, why the rating change?"
3,Pretty good overview,"Wish it were more indepth, but what do you want in 2 hours...overall good quality video that helped in a quick review."
2,A wasted opportunity,"A confused storyline, annoying flashing pics and a very bad editing make this video totally unfit to reach any real educational purpose. A decent effort is put on trying to create links between past and future, atoms and humans, big bang and pyramids... but that is not enough to make this a good video."
2,not as good as i thought it would be,"this movie will drive you nuts, one minute you are in the begining of the world and then all of a sudden you jump a millon years, movie is made well but the timing is crazy and the editing is not done well. Its not the worst but even i could have done a better job."
2,Half baked history of the world,"An audacious and bold attempt at explaining the history of the world. It follows the script of ""modern science"" which rejects alternative viewpoints and seems so sure of itself - and that is a major weakness. The documentary would have been better if it had at least acknowledged that ""Hey, maybe we are wrong about some things."" But then --- arrogance has always been a weakness of wo(MAN). This explanation is about as complete as if it was presented by a religious fundamentalist who ignores other religions and ""modern science."" The answer lies somewhere in between...and this documentary skews to one extreme.Nice graphics and animation though and explanations starting from Sumerian civilization."
4,Good summary of our world history,"Just saw the show on the History Channel. Quite well done, though without the commercials and repeats it was more like history of the world in 60-70 minutes. It would have been much better had they cut down on repetitions and added more details on human history. They did talk about the role of religions in our development. Well done, entertaining and without any major fabricated parts and, as far as I could tell, everything was based on evidence at hand."
5,Engaging and witty,I wish there were more books written in this vein. An incident near the beginning where our hero engages in diplomacy with an amphibious alien in a fish tank is hilarious and sets the whacky tone for the rest of the book. Gerrold could have made a whole series set in this world.
5,Balanced and informative,"Bottom line the book was very informative, which is what I was looking for. The writer takes a critical look at Opus Dei, and does a good job covering the history of the organization and the founder as well as describing current activities. If you are looking to learn about Opus Dei from an outsider's point of view, I highly recommend this book."
1,How is it possible to investigate into a powerful secretive society?,"How is it possible to investigate into a powerful secretive society? Only if 1. it is not powerful, or 2. it is not secretive, or 3. the author is a liar. In any case, the book is misleading."
2,"Biased Portrayal, Showing Jesuit-Opus Rivalry","Walsh, a former Jesuit, bases many conclusions about Opus (admittedly) on the Prelate's constitution of 1950! He holds the Prelature hostage to practices based on thier rule of half a century ago. What if someone's only view of America's south was a snapshot of 1954? While it may be true that Escriva was slow to embrace the liturgical changes of the Second Vatican Council, so were thousands of clerics ordained before 1969.Opus influence in anti-Marxist dictatorships is frequently cited, yet there exists no apology for Jesuits holding state positions in Ortega's Sandanista Cabinet! He concludes that Opus is ""less Christian"" than those who practice Liberation Theology. Ironically, it was a member of Walsh's former Order that was a US Congressman with a Pro-Abortion voting record."
1,No Help At All,"I PURCHASED THIS DICTIONARY/CONCORDANCE, THINKING I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET CLEARER INFORMATION ON WORDS AND/OR PHRASES USED IN THE BIBLE. THIS BOOK GIVES VERY VAGUE DEFINITIONS, AND DOES NOT HAVE MANY OF THE QUESTIONABLE WORDS IN IT. I DO NOT EVEN USE THIS BOOK; YOU WILL FIND MORE WORDS IN A WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY. WHEN YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR MORE DEPTH UNDERSTANDING, THIS BOOK IS NOT THE ONE. IT APPEARS THEY TRIED HARD, TO KEEP THE BOOK SMALL. BY COMPACTING BASIC WORDS, AND NOT ENOUGH WORDS THAT ONE MAY REALLY QUESTION. YOU GET LARGE PRINT BUT tiny DEFINITION. MOST INFORMATION IN THIS BOOK IS GOING TO BE IN YOUR BASIC BIBLE, GET A REAL CONCORDANCE, AND IF YOU MUST HAVE LARGE PRINT, YOU CAN BUY ONE OF THOSE MAGNIFICATION SHEETS TO LIE ON THE PAGE. BETTER TO HAVE A BIG BOOK, WITH MUCH INFORMATION, THAN A SMALL BOOK, WITH BIG PRINT AND little INFORMATION."
2,"By combining, you're losing...","While it appears to be a good tool--having a 2-in-1 approach, this book falls short by the very thing it promotes: two books in one.Any time you compromise a work and combine two into one, you won't get the best of both worlds; you get a diminished product that really doesn't meet your needs that much if at all.You are much better off buying a separate dictionary and concordance."
5,AJ Software & Multimedia Atomic Archive Review,An excellent publication for teaching and historical accounts. Provides easily undertsandable student information about atomic energy and development in lay terms. Excellent biographies of involved scientists and others involved with plentiful animated viewing aids. Unbiased historical account. Highly recommended.
3,"quality, but on the small side","I found this pack to be quality construction and materials, and it has a ""hole"" near the top for an ipod's earphone cord to go through. However, the inside space was smaller than I thought it would be from the website photo. It is good for a trip to the store, but not enough room for a day hike or any outdoor activity where you need to carry more than a small wallet, comb, cellphone and lipgloss."
2,Nice shape; shoddy workmanship,"I used a prior bag from this manufacturer for many years. When the clasp started to go, I bought this new bag. The bag has a nice shape, good strap and buckle. However, the workmanship of this bag is most disappointing. One of the seams opened within days of use because it simply was not correctly sewn."
4,Perfect,"All good, I liked it and was what I expected, very good quality product, hope to continue buying items from your store"
3,"Nice,rugged pack","This pack arrived promptly and looked as good as pictured. Nice looking,sturdy and sized well. I think the only minuses is I thought the pack would be more substantial for the price I paid. The unused portion of the straps also aren't secured very well so tend to loosen up and get in the way some. A little annoying. Not bad overall though."
2,Fanny Pack,This was purchased direct from Amazon. Although the product quality and shipping was good the color was wrong. A return was to much of a hassle so they gave me a 20% credit. I was satisfied with the arrangement.
3,Oil Portraits Step by Step,This book is a good beginners book for learning the basics of portrait painting.
4,Review for Hate Crime,"I found the novel Hate Crime to be exciting and captivating in a morbid sort of a way. The author describes the characters and events without any type of gruesomeness or hysteria, so I was able to continue reading the story with anticipation for what would happen next. I did not however enjoy the reporting part of the story. The actual trial I thought was a lot of filler, although I understood why it was wriiten in that manner. Ms. King is a reporter and that part of her writing style emerges as she retells this horrific story. It is a good story to use when comparing the writing styles of storytelling by two very different authors such as Truman Capote (In Cold Blood) v. Joyce King's novel."
4,Details that make you take a breath,"King's meshing of the genres creates an interweaving of a true to life event. She gives all the angles the proper amount of respect and decency. Through memoir, journalism, including impressive research and newswriting, and a sometimes humorous storytelling technique she implants the reader, whom she has cleverly made an unwilling participant, into the town of Jasper and into the lives of 3 troubled young murders. The story humanizes all involved and gives a unique perspective of the police officers, prosecuters and the press selected to cover the trial and the story. It is powerful in its truth and profound in it's honesty and vision. In his physical absence she has painted a picture of the victim, James Byrd Jr. The book makes the story leave an imprint because now the reader has not only hear the story but has bore witness to the event."
1,A writer who doesn't care....,"Of the two books written so far about this horrid crime, I'm not sure which book is worse. In both cases, I felt like the writers were thinking only of themselves rather than of the people they interviewed or the humans of all colors who live in this town.It was so very easy to blame what happened on it being a result of ""Southern culture,"" hicks, and good-ole boy mentality. I was outraged by how this writer, and the author of the other book on the subject, portrayed the people they interviewed. It's so easy for a writer (one is from the North, not sure about the other) to enter a situation that is already a horror and simply add a dash of this and a sprinkle of that and come up with the usual a CULTURE of hate.What happened to that poor man is so awful that I leave the room when someone asks my mother about it. She was on the jury. She saw the chain with his flesh and blood attached."
3,Eye Opening,"This book was definetly an eye opener to what happened and also to a problem that our nation does not want to admit we have. Racism is becoming more and more of an issue and this book, and the horrible ""dragging"", really opens eyes to what is going on."
4,Some survived,"The soundtrack to this film is second to the Decline of Western Civilization. I wouldn't give the film a rave a review (simply because I'm in it and I was awful), but it does represent some of the true spirit of the time, and many of us ""real folks"" (along with the fakes) were included. Penelope S. was very tolerant during filming, too. It may seem silly now, but this takes me down a happy-painful memory lane, even still. If you were there, or wish you had been, it's worth the listen."
2,missing a lot of the good songs,"Unfortunately, some of the good songs from the movie, like ""There's Too Many of Us"" aren't included on this soundtrack."
2,punk rock destroyed by '90s pop darlings,"it is a shame that sonic youth had to ruin this record some 14 years after the fact by adding there own ""take"" on things. who cares? this is meant to be punk rock from '83, not '97! staaaay awaaaay!"
4,I know why Richard hung himself---,"good charolette, more like bad green day who tryed to rip off bad religon..... sum-41? oh yeh sum body else already did that too."
2,"LA punk in 83, bleh","If only this came out earlier, the Vandals, DI and TSOL soundtrack, compare this to the blazing Decline of Western Civilization soundtrack. Still lightyears better than this mall punk crap the kids love today."
2,Ultimate Ozzie & Harriet,"I returned this item unopened because I noticed that all of the episodes of the TV Show ""Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" in it were contained in the other product I purchased at the same time, ""Essential Ozzie & Harriet."" It would have been helpful if there had been a way to compare episode titles before purchase."
4,first time user,This is the first time I have used this stuff to control Peach leaf curl problem. So far I see good results.
2,Just the facts Mam.,"On this date x happens... I did not like the lack of details reguarding the Drivers, Team Members, and Support Personel."
1,Avoid at all cost,"This is junk. It works for a few months & then all of a sudden, the thing locks up. The LED is still on, but nothing happens. This may sound crazy, but I've replaced it about 5 times & Conair are great with replacements, but the last one they sent me, I haven't even opened. I went out and purchased a different brand.I had to give it a star, but really, no stars for this one"
3,Great master class,"Excellent five star material for the price of a lesson. I am new to the piano accordion. This instruction will give me food for thought for coming years. The presentation covers several technical aspect of playing. It's well organized and endorsed by Karen Tweed (one of my favorite accordionists). If only it played on my DVD players.The disc is double sided. NTSC on one side. PAL format on the other. The main menu comes up, but I'm unable to select anything to play. It's the first DVD I've found that hasn't worked with my OPPO DVD players -- which are PAL capable. I hope the producers of this DVD further test it's playability and fix its compatibility issues.I would return it if it were not such an excellent tutorial. I am able to view the material on my computer using Windows Media Player. That will suffice for my needs.My thanks to Murray Grainger for his no nonsense presentation of this material.Shame on the folks who mastered these DVD."
3,Film not restored?,"As the cover photo indicates, a greenish cast is present throughout this video, suggesting that the source film was not restored or enhanced after it was digitized. If this bothers you, you should look elsewhere. Most of the content relates to Eva Braun and members of her family, including a visit to Italy, possibly Hitler's State visit in 1938. The scenes with Hitler are well-known and are best watched on other DVDs where they have been restored to full color. The only advantage here is completeness."
4,Soulcraft;Crossing into the Mysteries of Nature and Psyche,"Read this book at night and as you fall asleep, quest your Soul for answers. They will come; Bill Plotkin has written a powerful book that can facilitate the makings of your prayers."
2,Motive says all,I bought this book because of the photos. I had seen an excerpt online and thought it might really be reflective. In the end I didn't care for it at all. Must not be where I currantly am.
5,Those who wander are not necessarily lost...J.R.R. Tolkien,"This is a book to read in autumn. Follow your rhythm and read on a rock. Read the poetry out loud. The message and the power of these pages is nourishment for our particular starvation.The warp of this book is the constant of nature as teacher, guide, and lover. The weft is the movement of story as curiousity, disturbance, and evolution. Soulcraft explores wandering, touching, noticing as acts of social disobedience. Soulcraft turns left when most turn right and invites one to climb into the mud. Simple, but not easy, unpretentious, but not without sophistication soulcrafting is always about unearthing threads of one's authentic story.Bill Plotkin is a weaver of the medicines that are waiting for the patient...at least the one's who are willing to take their first deep breath."
5,Wonderful,"I enjoyed and learnt so much from this book. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a more meaningful and fulfilling life and to those feeling lost, depressed or alienated by urban landscapes and soulessness. I believe Bill Plotkin's book provides the knowledge needed to understand how to connect with your soul and live authentically. This knowledge seems to have been lost over many centuries by our ancestors. I believe we desperately need to reclaim our soul life if we want to live complete lives. A wise person once told me that westerners tend to confuse money with things of real value and that life should be about creating not acquiring. Soulcraft inspires such a life."
5,Wonderful and enlighteningi,This book is insightful and a good teaching tool for the Native American Ritual. The writer puts you at the ritual with words!
1,wish I could demand a refund!,"This book is nothing more than a bunch of nonsense. It contains endless statements making no sense. I was truly looking forward to a book that would be a refreshing alternative to most pop-psychology that's on the market. Instead I got a text that was written by someone who couldn't think. It was full of illogical, unsupported statements and arguments. If I could, I would demand my money back I'm that upset with my purchase.I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone who has any ability to think whatsoever!"
5,Super recomendable,"Diferente, hermoso, con un tono narrativo que no es el típico de los libros para chicos. Cuanto más se lo leo a mi hijo de dos años, más me gusta, más posibilidades de narrarlo descubro desde su economía de palabras y la expresividad de sus dibujos. Con frases cortas y texto breve, es perfecto para los más chicos."
5,The American Practical Navigator,Most informative in detail book on navigation I own. Full of helpful charts and information about different types of navigation. I highly recomend this book for anybody interested in marine navigation.
5,"Excellent book, excellent buy","Bowditch is the ""bible"" for nautical navigation. It's a must have for every serious mariner's library. My purchase was listed as used but ""like new"" and it was indeed like new. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5,Classic,"The American Practical Navigator has been a classic since the early 1800's. This bicentennial edition not only includes traditional subjects such as tides, celestial, and terrestrial navigation, but also includes electronic navigation.The book is a must have reference for any serious student of navigation."
5,The Definitive Navigation Manual,"For over two centuries Nathaniel Bowditch's ""American Practical Navigator"" has trained sailors from all maritime services the basics (and then some) of navigation. Both comprehensive and surprisingly engaging, Bowditch is a must read for anyone serious about spending time at sea. As a companion, consider also purchasing the ""Chapman Piloting & Seamanship""Chapman Piloting & Seamanship 65th Edition (Chapman Piloting, Seamanship and Small Boat Handling). Taken together, these two manuals build a foundation for a life time of safe and savvy boating."
5,Nice watch,"I got this little beauty for Christmas. It's a fantastic looking watch and just feels like a quality piece.The main reason that I wanted to write this review however, is just to say that the watch looks bigger than 40mm IMHO. I actually went to measure it after I initially put it on, because I thought Amazon's specs must have been mistaken. I believe the unadorned stainless steel bezel just makes the watch look bigger. That being said, the size is perfect for what I wanted (I was actually worried 40mm might be a tad smaller than what I was looking for). This watch further confirms my theory of 40-43mm being the sweet spot for a great looking watch.It's quartz movement, which will cause some of the watch snobs to shun it, but if you're looking for a clean, classic looking swiss watch, I'd definitely recommend this one."
2,"Picture is New, I received Old","The picture from the site was the current model, I received the 2007 model. Stopped working after a few days. I checked the return policy for the store and once out of the box, they would not take the watch back. The Swiss Army warrenty was good, so I had to send my new/old watch in and they fixed it. Won't buy a watch from them ever again."
4,Dictionary of Mathematics (Collins Dictionary),Its a dictionary! What else is there to say? Well the definitions are readable and understandable but I still wish I could find a mathematical source for definitions that are first presented in non mathematical terms and then mathematical terms.
3,Non Fiction,"This is a dictionary, even though it says Mathematics. You can look up various people, equations, formulae, constants and techniques and that sort of thing in here. This will occasionally be useful for looking something up you have forgotten or the odd browse."
2,Direct Transfer from VHS,"I honestly haven't used this much because I was disappointed to find out it was transferred directly to DVD from VHS without any consideration for the features DVD provides. There are no chapters to select, just place it in the DVD player and hit play. One is then subjected to having to listen to host advise you to fast-forward to the end to learn the moves and reset your counter to zero to easily find your way back to the tape's current location. (Note to Reebok, this on DVD, not VHS anymore!)Not being able to select where to begin your exercise, you'll have to endure the the warm-up portion even if you have your own warm-up routine. I tried skipping it, but the disk jumped to some point in the middle of warm-up. I skipped to the next track, but the main exercise had already started at some earlier point.Thus, this DVD is too poorly organized (that is, it's not organizaed at all for DVD players) to be flexible. Because of this, I haven't used it much."
5,Love this workout,"This is the third copy of this work out I've purchased. Lost one in a move, wore out the VHS copy I used it so much over a 10 year period.The workout itself is fun and the results are great. The circuit consists of stepping and strength training, in one minute intervals each.The step workout is easy to follow and has modifications for low and high intensity. Instruction is shown for each variation and the choreography is fun and easy to understand.The strength training intervals give the option of using a resistance band or dumbells. Instruction is given for each option.The only issue I have is that I get bored with the music. Once I became thoroughly familiar with the moves, I found I could follow the video and listen to my own choice of music on another device.All in all, this is a great addition to any work out routine. I highly recommend it."
2,Odd collection,"I love Windham Hill collections. They have always been great. However, this collection is odd. It's not the soothing, melodic music I am accustomed to. I was pretty disappointed, to be honest. I played it in the retail store that I manage, where I like to play Windham Hill and various pieces of laid-back music. I actually turned it off. There's not much peaceful about it. Who would imagine saying that about Windham Hill?"
4,This indie really isn't a waste of time,"Although its title may be misleading, ""The Pornographer"" presents us with a very interesting theme which stands out among thousands of Hollywood's cliche-filled screenplays. The dialogue, while not carrying any string of ""memorable lines"", is quite honest and delightful. When it comes to the inside look at the porn industry, however, this indie drama fails to offer a full, convincing picture (probably due to low budget and/or lack of experience). I particularly like Michael DeGood. His portrayal of a next door loser is no less impressive than Mark Wahlberg's characterization of an ambitious young guy in ""Boogie Nights"". Anyway, had (co-producer) Katheryn Cain tried harder in her acting, had Monique Parent spent some more time studying what Melanie Griffith did in ""Body Double"", this movie could be much more entertaining. All in all, not a waste of time. You better give it a try."
3,"Good, but Melodramatic","Good, sad movie. Gives lots of info on the industry, and puts the Dave Matthews - looking protagonist in a really tight spot where you're really wondering what he's going to do, then gets reeeeally crazy overly dramatic at the end. Not ridiculous, but unrealistic enough so that if you were in a cynical mood the movie would be ruined. Worth watching."
1,Gives porn a bad name....,The Good: Director Doug Atchison attempts to make a very heavy-handed point regarding the exploitation of women by the porn business. I appreciate his point and applaud his efforts. Unfortunately Atchison has created a totally unbelievable melodrama to make his point.The Bad: The last man to preach to me this heavily was wearing a collar. Atchison should get down off his pulpit and put together a believable movie. His inexperience destroys this movie.The first half of the movie works ok. You get a feel for this dysfunctional loser and actually feel sorry for him on many levels. DeGood does well at being the loser next door. Halfway through the film everything goes wrong.This movie is so bad that Bill Maher isn't even listed on the credits. We all know that didn't happen by accident. (...)
1,o.k,the song trendsetter is good but thats pretty much it. look at the bottum of the item to sample the music . i only liked one song
5,The Men Who Shot Kennedy,We had been having trouble getting this DVD after seeing it on Public Television channel. I was really happy to see that a seller had it available and ready to ship out....but I never guessed that it would take me 25 days to receive it! I will never buy from this seller again and will not recommend him to any of my friends.I will strictly keep my buying to Amazon.com when I need something else.
4,Makes one wonder,"Glad to have a DVD of this great series. Sad that parts Seven, Eight and Nine have been withheld.Hope some day they too will be included. Hear that History Channel."
4,An Interesting View,Very interesting theories exist regarding this unfortunate historical event. This DVD provided some interesting information.
3,From an Aussie whop cares...,"I have seen the series on the Histroy Cahnnel a couple of years back and was really enthused about obtaining the series on dvd. I am disappointed that all of the series was not finally compiled on this offering.I think, as an Australian growing up in the sixties, that all the information presented on History Channel could have been allowed on the final cut as I believe all of it is relevant.Robert Freeman.Australia."
1,info suppression,Originally there were nine parts to TMWKK. A DVD that I ordered had only six (like the six listed here).
4,Drain Patrol - JFK shot from sewer!,"This video will open your eyes. Until now, I had thought that only Hunt and Sturgis were involved with David Christ and Harrelson. This video has to be seen to be believed!"
2,"Interesting, but totally one-sided view of the JFK murder","""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" is an interesting series, but in all candor I'd say 95% of it is fiction, just like Oliver Stone's movie ""JFK."" It's basically a showcase for pro-conspiracy beliefs, many of which are truly ridiculous. If you believe Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin you are going to be frustrated and annoyed by this program because that side of the story is almost completely ignored."
4,Best When Sampled With Other Offerings,"The Men Who Killed Kennedy is both facinating and fanciful at the same time. I suggest that the interested person read and then re-read ""Best Evidence"" by James Lipton. This well-researched work is a must and the most thorough I have read (and I think I've read most of them)."
1,MISSING THE BEST PARTS,"The version here, is missing the three ""good"" episodes -- the ones that aren't the same old clips we've seen for 40 years. ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy, the Final Chapter"" is the one you want.If a version doesn't have;. The Love Affair. The Guilty Men. The Smoking Gun-- Then don't buy it."
5,EPISODE 2 WAS AWESOME !!!,We know who the killer is!! It's some guy by the name of Lucien Sarti!! There is a picture of him behind the fence on the grassy knoll and he is wearing a police uniform.What a brillant plan.There were 3 killers and 2 of them are still alive !! Let's catch them!!
5,The Men Who killed Kennedy,I have made a study of Presiden Kennedy's assination and have reviewed many documentaries and books on the subject. This documentary is the best and most complete I've seen. It should be seen by every American and make us all wonder just what our goverment was up to. Even though in Oct/Nov 2003 on the 40th anniversary of the assination and 14 years after this documentary was made the Net Works still brought out their version that Oswald was the lone gunmen. It just proves that somehow they will not do enough investigation to maybe change there view. It makes one all the more convenced that this documentary is probably the closest compiled infomation to the truth! This documentary is still selling after 16 years on the market it just proves that the American public still isn't satisfied and wants answers. Its that serious.
5,Killer,"I love this series. About seven years ago I spent all day recording that off of the History Channel with no commericals. Its that good! I'm glad to see that its finally on DVD, but they do need to include everything. I think its a great overview of the assassination along with Jim Marrs Crossfire. This is a good primer to kick start any entry level JFK researcher."
3,Just the Facts,"I remember this series for exposing the ""grassy knoll"" sniper and revealing stupid lapses in secret service security and intelligence agencies'investigations.But,In the last section of the series;a expert claims that the head shot came from a sewer opening,not the grassy knoll.This series should force the gov't to do a full disclosure on the Kennedy killing to expose all lies on both sides of the debate."
5,Video enhances classroom!,"My name is Randy Durr. I teach a Modern US History class at Roberts High School in Roberts, Montana. The class is required of all Seniors and we spend approximately eight weeks on the Kennedy assassination. We top off the class with an annual Senior Trip to Dallas in the Spring of each year.This documentary has been a GREAT addition to my class. Its detail and research based materials enhance my student's perspective of one of the most studied aspects of American history.I highly recommend this video to anyone interested in the Kennedy assassination!"
5,"A quite revealing documentry,would be better with episodes 7 thru 9","This was quite a revealing documentry. I first saw it,when it first aired in 1988,and forgot that there were 9 episodes altogether.I would like to see this documentry re released with the 7 thru 9 episodes included,and a seperate DVD with the missing episodes for those who already purchased this documentry. I hope the remaining episodes will be released soon? The best way to re release the entire documentry with episodes 7 thru 9 would be in blu Ray. The Forces of Darkness was one of the best episodes. A must see documentry for anyone interested in the JFK murder."
1,The Men who lied to us!!,This documentary was produced in 1988 By Nigel Turner and broadcast on Btitish TV. The station received many angry letters from viewers and from the British government who did an investigation and found out that most of the info on the documentary was not true or made up. Nigel Turner was forced to apologize and the film was not shown on British TV again. Then it was shown on The History Channel a few years ago and many angry letters were sent to the station including ones from former presidents Ford and Carter. The History Channel did their own investigation and found many errors in the documentary and made an apology and would not broadcast it again. Don't buy this dvd!!
1,"Lies, lies, and more lies...","Shame on the History Channel for still showing this completely discredited ""documentary."" If you want to know who really killed Kennedy, read the Warren Report, or Case Closed, or Reclaiming History. But if you prefer fiction, fantasy, baloney, and paranoia, rent this piece of junk."
4,Inspirational,I was delighted to find this little gem again! A friend had given me this book of meditations over three decades ago to help me through a rough time. I passed it along to another friend in need. The simple wisdoms of Emmet Fox are wonderful meditation material to navigate the day - and my spiritual journey. I recommend it for anyone on a spiritual quest.
5,Inspiring,"This is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. I recommend it to anyone that needs inspiration and understanding, and what a great buy. Worth reading."
3,Too many subplots,"this book needs to focus more on Dracula, especially at the end when Dracula just up and gets killed"
5,Excellent,This is the perfect size that I needed to keep in my car when I do not go home and have to go out after work.
5,Couldn't beat the price,"Chrome is my favorite cologne, and I find Amazon to have the best price. I usually buy the smaller 3.4oz bottle, but this time when I saw that the price of the 6.8oz bottle was less than buying two of the smaller bottles would be, I figured I'd take advantage and save a few bucks in the long run. Overall saved quite a bit off dept store price. Item arrived a little sooner than expected, which is always nice."
4,Good Buy,"I first got a free vial from stores. The smell was excellent and fresh, it stayed for the whole day. I bought this perfume(100 ml) on my next visit to the stores, the quality of the perfume was bad, it had some irritating smell. So people who are about to buy this perfume make sure its fresh stock.As far as the smell is concerned its soft and lasts longer, i am comfortable with daily usage.Overall a best buy!"
2,Failed,I feel like that it is water down. It smells good at first but then it doesn't stick. I ask everyone if they can smell my cologne and they cannot. I had sprayed it 3 times over my body. 2 Stars because I can smell a feint of it.
3,just ok thing,I purchased this spray trying it once in Macy store and read the review on this site as well. I liked the fragrance. The bottle I received did well for first few days and after that it was loosing its fragrance. It does not last more than hour or two.
2,Terrible vocals on some songs,"I was looking for strictly Disney songs to be played by strings, no singing. The music sample clips are mis-leading because the songs ""Colors of the Wind"", ""A Whole New World"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" all had terrible singers singing along. I don't understand why it is ""101 Strings Ochestra"" and then singing for a few of the songs. It feels like there were some singers that loved these songs and just had to sing while the rest are purely instrumental. Those three songs were what made me purchase this CD. Had I known there would be terrible singers singing along to the music, I would not have bought this CD. The music for all of the other songs are really nice though; they are what I was looking for. Listening to ""A Whole New World"" right now makes me want to gouge out my eyes; singers sing at such a slow pace and it sounds like they are amateur singers at the local karaoke."
5,Cruising in Catamarans,"This is the most comprehensive study of sailing catamarans on the market today. It gives a detailed account of many of the different makes and models of cats which are for sale. The average consumer can draw from Charles Kanter's extensive experience as a marine surveyor and knowledgeable sailor. Mr.Kanter is always very forthright with his opinions about boats and boating. As brokers in South Florida we have used Mr. Kanter's books and knowledge to assist many of our customers. We reccommend it as the best source for detailed information about catamarans and the art of sailing catamarans. If anyone is considering buying a catamaran to cruise, to daysail or to livaboard this is the book to buy."
3,useful information but annoying writting style,Mr. Kanter has a lot of experience with multihulls a fact that he reminds the reader every other paragraph. He also seems to feel that every paragraph must be showing that multihulls are in someway better than monohulls rather than just providing information. There is a lot of good information in this book but by the end of it I wanted to slap the author.
5,Pleasant Surprise,"Wow, All the questions I ever had about cruising catamarans but did not know who to ask, now I have a source for the answers. This book impressed me as real information without any hint of a sales pitch. That alone is refreshing. It also outlined a thoughtful method of comparing one vessel to another based upon my personal needs. I love the easy to use forms. The chapter on how to handle the twin engine boats under popwer is dynamite. I am all prepared now when I charter this year in Thailand. Could go on and on but I sure do say Thanks Chuck, thanks for my enlightenment."
2,Barely Okay,"Contrary to other reviewers I found this book to be long on opinion and short on fact. There was certainly some interesting stuff in it, but much of it was repeated and rehashed. Any author that thinks the Seawind 1000 is a race boat needs to get out more. I am glad I bought it but I am unsure if I will keep it."
1,Over $150 for a book?!?,"Clearly this book is intended only for libraries. The absurd price is a brutal assessment of the publishing world of the book's potential to sell to a general public. If they had expected it to sell more widely, they would have priced it differently. So this is a challenge to all those who rate this book highly: what have the publishers missed, and can you produce sales statistics that prove them wrong?"
5,I am chocolate covered bananas,My young children loved the book I think it is wonderful that the author who are children have the opportunity to share such an imagination with the world.
4,"absolutely great films,but dvd quality lacking","I pre-ordered this whole set and have watched the short film,half of fando y liz,and all of el topo and the holy mountain:film-making at it's best! there are a few errors in editing,but that's small beans compared to everything else you get in visuals and thoughts.my only gripe is that with both el topo and the holy mountain the dvds had digital blips from manufacturing(the discs are 100% scratchless and I have a high-end regular dvd player)at a few points.with any normal movie this would be fine,but when a film is art such as these,the viewer is usually more discerning.still great,but I wish they would've done a better job at checking production."
5,Surrealist Masterpieces,"Human nature revealed. Great explorations of the dark and mundane sides of man. After years of obscurity finally this important work has become accessible in the original, just as it blew NYC minds at the Elgin. Histories unearthed."
3,Faded Glory,"When first viewed in the early 70's it left me speechless (El Topo). Viewing that film & the others now,reminded me of the Italian directors of that era. Still it is a great set to view with mental patients."
3,save your money,........not woth the dough in my opinion............a few sequences of interesting imagery consting of about 15 minutes total time.......all art is open to interpretation but this slab of filmmaking did not do it for me....could not connect with any of the characters and the plot/non plot did not lead me in but a few interesting areas.
1,Put your credit card away...,"One of the things I like about amazon is you can read the reviews and the suggestions they offer. Some days I will decide to purchase items on a whim, other times based on suggestions and reviews and hope to be pleasantly surprised. This was not the case with this DVD set. I'll say that I have some eclectic tastes and can enjoy a movie that is abstract, artsy or doesn't subscribe to a typical movie format or standard. With that being said, Fando y Lis was a monumental disappointment. I didn't finish watching this movie and to be fair to the dvd set I have not watched the other two movies included. Amateur and pointless are two words that come to mind. I didn't feel like I was being moved in any way, positive or negative. I am not a film maker or student so maybe there were some technical aspects of this film that I would not know to appreciate. Maybe I'll give Holy Mountain a spin and become a believer. Save your money kids, Tar cannot be reached through this dvd set."
3,Love Thomas Jefferson....not enough quotes for a whole book...,"This book had some great quotes in it, but it was way too short to earn a good rating. The book is only 30+ pages with 3-6 quotes on almost every page. Most quotation books have at least 400 - 4,000 quotes, so this was a huge disappointment. That being said, Thomas Jefferson said many profound things, and if you are a huge Jefferson fan, you will probably find a lot of value in this book. If that's you, Enjoy!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
1,Not worth it!,"This book is tiny! It's 32 pages with about 4 short quotes per page. Not worth $10. Barely worth $2. Know what you're getting into before you buy this book. The five star reviews are highly misleading and don't appear to be reviewing this specific book. I'm returning it immediately because the publisher, Applewood Books, is obviously inflating the reviews or there is a mistake on Amazon's part. Either way, don't waste your money. Thomas Jefferson was an amazing person, but his legacy should not be tarnished by this ""book."""
3,QUOTATIONS OF THOMAS JEFFERSON,"At approximately $10.00 I expected a little more material than this 32 page, index card size book, provided."
4,wow,written is such a clear and concise manner. I cannot wait until the snow stops to go out and try what I am learning. I wold have given it 5 stars but I have to see how I do! :-)
4,Big foot strikes again,"We live in Pittsburgh, PA, so this was an especially delightful book with references to Southwestern Pennsylvania. Magdelena Yoder, who is a self-acclaimed bigfoot with her size 11 shoes, is a liberal mennonite at best, but she does have her limits. In this book not only is a murder solved, but we become invested in her relatives and all the inhabitants within a 20 mile radius of her B & B. These are the kinds of characters you want to know more about. This book reminds me of the sherbert served in between main courses. I had just finished a more serious intense novel. ""Custard's Last Stand"" cleansed my literary palate for other adventures, but you better believe I will have another one waiting to be read between the main course and dessert."
1,Really disappointed!,"So sad I spent the money on this book. Poor writing, comedic style that simply isn't funny, unrealistic and trite dialogue, foundering story line... I'm a third of the way through the book and no one has died yet and nothing's been stolen--there's no mystery yet! I too have a Mennonite heritage and my relatives would kick her right out of Hernia for her blase' attitude about her religion... I picked up the book hoping for some simple, clean fun taking place in a familiar community. Instead I was irritated and bored. Sorry, but no dice. Won't even be finishing this terrible book. Run away!"
1,mindless twaddle,"This was the most trite,jejune,semi precious repetitive, coy,piece of pulp that has ever sullied my eyes and rotted my brain.The characters were no dimensional,plot was as thin as an unbaked custard,and all of the tee hee references to sex were beyond belief. I have to read a fewdanielle Steele novels in an effort to regain the IQ points this book robbed from me."
5,ALABAMA does it again,"You go Randy and the rest of your wonderful co-singers. I would hope this would get you another award, and number one hit. Keep up the good work."
1,I am not pleased with Alabama mixing country with rap or pop,I cannot beleive that Alabama would mix rap/pop or what ever you think it is. I mean mixing a tad bit of rock and creating rock'abily is one thing but rap'abiliy? I don't think they should be trying rap and stuff all they did it for is the money.
5,A must read,"WOW. What a powerful, easy to understand book about the whole ball of wax. If you are looking for THE book on Futures and Options, how they work, the reason behind price changes and an easy to understand system to trading look no further! A heart felt thanks Mr. Kleinman on a real work of art."
5,Loved it,Kleinman takes the mystery out of the commodities market. I wish I would have had this book before I attempted my series 3! It would have made the process much easier. The NFA should make this required reading.
3,the Jury is hung,"I am not sure what to make of Gordon. Is he just showing off on this disc or do his growls, yelps and groans add up to something. I will say that as a trombone fan, you get to hear him do things that no one has ever done on record. (Al Grey maybe?). Still, some of it leave me cold, as if the songs exist just as a means for him to display his talents. Does he delve into the soul of Monk's Green Chimneys, or is he just putting christmas lights around it? Ofcourse, finding the heart of a Monk song is a lot to ask of any artist, but then this is an artist with exceptional skills. Question is, does it end there? ."
2,Dice,these tiny dice are well made and very unique! They ended up being alot smaller than what we first thought they would be but that ended up being alright. One of them ended up in the top of an ear right above an earcuff on a guys left ear and the other one was small enough to be used as a nose ring it looks very small and feminine not like I would of imagined it but they turned out looking nice where they ended up.
3,Too much,This is the worst possible book anyone can ever get to prepare for math level II...on my first try i got a 550 something but when i checked answers he made so many mistakes.I was begining to doubt myself!My real score was over a 100 pts higher.i used barrons and improved a lot.
2,This book is NOT 'realistic',"This book contains BAD english and sentences that are way too long. It is not ""realistic"" at all. Some of the problems I had to read over a second time because the problem was soooo long i got lost in the middle of reading the problem. Yea the word problems were definitely not the best. Too wordy.The book had great problems(excluding the word problems) but if you are looking for something ""realistic"" to prepare you for the real test, I would not recommend this prep book. even barrons was better and more like the real test."
4,Great Book,"This book really fills the gap and it is one of a kind as it presents a variety of 15 ""very realistic"" tests. The questions are unique and solutions are OK. There is just one slight issue though, some of the solutions could have been more detailed. The tests are slightly harder than the usual but they provide the student with good training. The author has included a chapter on solving equations and inequalities with TI that accounts for 5 to 10 of the questions in the 2C test; however if this book is used along with the TI book of the same author, it will serve its purpose in a better way. The organization of this book is fine, I mean the tests, solutions and the answer keys; but the author has forgotten to include answer sheets this time. As a high school precalculus teacher, I recommend this book to all students and teachers."
4,"Helpful, good pictures, lots of different things to make","This is a good book for those trying to get started. There are three presentations for each balloon creation. One version shows how the proportions look on the balloon as it is laid out. Another shows a diagram with the sequence of each twist. For anything complex there are several diagrams showing the creation in steps. And the final presentation shows the finished project. Taken individually these are OK, but together they are very helpful.I've only looked at a few books so far on folding and twisting balloons, but this is my favorite. If you are trying to learn how to fold balloons, this is a good book to start with."
2,Outdated designs,Unfortunately the ballon designs are a bit dated. A lot of single balloon color designs that leave a lot to be desired.
2,Good.... if you don't know any better,"I bought this book when I started balloon twisting. Even back then I wasn't so impressed with the figures in it but it was OK, at least a start. There are so many other books & DVD's out there, I think you can do better, even as a beginner. My recommendation is to skip books and go for DVD's. You get much better instructions and you see the figure evolve while you follow it yourself.It is definitely NOT the ultimate book!!!"
4,not a bad starters book,this is like most of the starters books lots of good ideas to do in it to keep you going and learning.balloon modeling is good fun and good for the mind and this book just helps that.so if your thinking of taking it up this is a good book to help you do just that.
4,A terrific supplement to an American classic!,"This reprint of the out-of-print, expensive original edition is less cumbersome than it's predecessor and includes a dvd version of the film. The price is right now, and it's still a coffee-table book with a lush, suede binding and attractive design in the Taschen tradition. Movie buffs shouldn't resist purchasing it.The DVD is the 2nd-rate, MGM/UA letterboxed version, so replace it, if you can, with the later, revised, anamorphic double-disc version, in the proper 1:66 to 1 screen aspect ratio."
4,Scientifically factual. Not at all a huge pile of crap.,"This book, which is filled to the brim with scientific facts and theory, helped me a great deal. I can now hang out and stare in the Victoria's Secret dressing rooms without leaving my stuffy, grime-encrusted apartment. I can also see through Bill Gates' eyes and have stolen all the code to Longhorn and sold it to Steve Jobs for $600. So this fine scientific tome made me a profit! Money well spent. Thanks, Mr. Rifat!P.S....I would have rated this book 5 stars, but the fact that it's utter b.s. that only an acid casualty would believe drops it a full star."
4,otoscope,This otoscope will definitely meet my needs as a home tool to use for assessment of family/friend ear complaints. I am an RN and find this a useful handy tool to have on hand. Have not used it much yet but seems to be of good quality for viewing the ear canal.
3,"nice scope, disappointing bulb life","The otoscope is easy to handle and works well. However, the bulb that it came with burned out much sooner than expected - after probably less than 20 minutes of total use. Consider purchasing an LED scope instead."
2,Quality Product but doesn't work right,"My sister-in-law is an audiologist and showed me how to use this tool appropriately. The bulb isn't strong enough to generate enough light to reflect light off the eardrum, therefore, it's not really all that useful. The quality of the instrument itself is well made and very durable, however, it doesn't work for what I need this for."
5,otoscope,Very high quality set. I've purchased 3 less expensive otoscopes in the past year that either broke or were no good. I wish I would had just spent a little extra money the first time and bought this one. My son had tubes about a year ago from frequent ear infections.
5,Looks sturdy,"Hopefully, we wouldn't need to use it often. We tried it out on each other and our 2yr old. You can see all the ear wax, etc. I guess if there was an ear infection, you would see some redness, etc. Worth the price for peace of mind..."
4,Esta bueno este otoscopio,Se lo regale a mi medica y le vino muy bien. Es de muy buena calidad y me llego sin inconvenientes y en excelentes condiciones.
4,Great choice for any household,"We bought this one to replace a cheaper pen version. This may not be ""professional"" quality that you would find in a ENT office, but it has great viewing and excellent light. Can easily see the entire eardrum which means no more running to the Pediatricians office every time the kids pull on their ears! At $90 an office visit, it more than pays for itself. Would of gave it 5stars but the head is a little loose on the body of the handle-don't know if that is intentional or a design flaw."
5,Great item for the price,"I'm a nurse and use otoscopes at work. I purchased this one for home use so i can check my children's ears. At first i could not see in their tiny ears with the otoscope that came. I emailed customer service and they explained i needed the 2mm disposable specula that can be attached with the attachment that came with the item. I attached the disposable ones (actually got a few from my pediatrician) and was able to visualize well. The light does come up in the middle of the view, but this does not effect the quality of the view and was an excellent buy for the money/home use. I would highly recommend this item AND their fantastic customer service."
3,Solid but flawed Product,"This Otoscope is reasonably price and gets the job done, but it's disposable spectula adapter is crap. It does not hold the disposable tips on, hindering your ability to manuaver during otoscopy. It you don't mind washing and sanitizing your tips after each use, then you will probably like this product just fine."
