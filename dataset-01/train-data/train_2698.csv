5,"Great story, did not put it down",I was curious about this book ever since I read it had won the Booker Award but did not actually read it until my book club assigned it. It was great. A very quick read with a unique premise. It was also very spiritual and philosophical without being preachy. Some parts were just out and out gross. These parts only emphasized the struggle for survival and that all of our humanity even the most base tendencies must be realized. Those moments of horror were balanced with humor. The whole book was a testament to the indomitable human spirit. I thought about this book for days and still remember little phrases from it that I liked. I highly recommend it as it has been adopted as one of my favorites.
2,Sure to cure your insomnia,I still haven't finished this and have since moved on. after five chapters I still have no idea what it's about.
5,Outstanding,This book really shows the struggle that a person may ensure and that will power will keep someone moving for a long time. I would recommend this book to someone who is trying to seek God or trying to understand him. This book is truly inspiring!
3,melville the master / martel the pretender,Melville wrote a book about the sea - Martel wrote a book about the sea.Melville's was a masterpiece - Martel's will be forgotten next season.
3,A Good Read,"Well written for the most part, but could have benefited from some judicious editing.A few whole chapters in fact. Still Life of Pi is good read."
4,Good read,Enjoyable read. Spiritual without being pontificating. I also liked this illustrations. The second reading was as enjoyable as the first
4,IT WAS WORTH BUYING.,"I TRULY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THIS BOOK WAS ALL ABOUT WHEN I BOUGHT.IT. I RECEIVED DIFERENT VARIATIONS ON THE STORY FROM PEOPLE, BUT EVERYONE LIKED IT. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SOME PARTS & HAD TO GO BACK & REREAD IT. I FOUND IT AMAZING WHAT THE MAN & ANIMAL WENT THROUGH. I WAS SORRY THAT HE NEVER FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TIGER AFTER THEY PARTED."
4,I was torn,"I had heard a lot about this book and everyone I knew raved about it. So, I added it to my wish list and got it for the holidays.I must say, it starts off VERY slow. I couldn't keep with it for the first 50 pages or so. Then it picked up. And I could not put the book down. Between Pissing's (and I still crack up at the mention of his name and the happenings on the life boat) roving eye for religion and his journey for land -- you simply can't believe what you read. Or can you?I am glad I stuck with it and read it through to the end!"
2,Life of Pi,The book was very well written. Not my type of book. It was selected as a book for my book club. I thought it would be more spiritual. A bit too much agony and strife to take in for a pleasure read.
4,Life of Pi,A great story. I chose this book because of the movie promotion. It was hard to put down. Descriptions were quite complicated in places (On the lifeboat). I liked the story of Pi's early religious experiences and how he overcame the threat of the tiger by feeding it and controlled it by being dominant.
4,Life of Pi,"Entertaining read. A little slow at times, but overall I enjoyed it. Would recommend to anyone interested in religion or philosophy."
5,Amazing and symbolic - I loved this book,"I read between 50 and 80 books a year and it is the rare novel that does not disappoint me on some level. This book never let me down, I was never bored and I never felt the author cheated or left loose ends. The language was simple and lyrical but full of symbolism and symmetry. I loved the main character's honesty and optimism and his simple will to survive. Above all I loved the choice of an alternate ending, neither story is a perfect fit leaving the reader the choice to make up their own mind. I laughed, I cried and I'm recommending it to everyone I know."
3,Comment from a translator,"I translated the book into Catalan (Barcelona? Does it ring a bell?), and I must say I don't find it so disappointing as some reviewers say. I am not referring to the religious aspects in the novel, but to the de-humanization, either on a boat or surrounded by thousands of people: when it comes to our survival, or our basic needs, we are beasts. It does not matter what we are taught by religions, or social conditions, or family values: when we badly need something, Mr Hyde takes over Dr Jekyll.And strictly about the novel: is the ""adventure"" disgustingly believable? Then I believe that the writer has achieved his goal."
4,Enjoy the Journey,"I would give it 4 and 3/4 stars actually. I was a little let down by the ending, but I wholeheartedly enjoyed the journey and would definitely recommend the book to friends. It was an amazing and well-written story and it challenges the reader to think."
2,Severly Depressing,"While ""Life of Pi"" is very imaginative I found the entire story so sad and depressing. Ususally with sad novels there is some value or moral that makes the story worth reading - I didn't find one in ""Life of Pi"", it was simply despair."
4,Pretty good,"I liked the story overall. It got a bit gory, especially at the end when Pi is telling the story without the animals. The first hundred or so pages offer interesting perspectives concerning the story without the animals. Overall, it made for a good book. Can't wait to see the movie."
1,Very hard to follow,Started with the best intentions but was so bored I couldn't make myself finish it. Don't understand all the hype about this book.
5,Amazing,"I absolutely loved this book a beautiful tale I can't describe or pick the words to tell you what this book made me feel, I loved the ending one of the best endings I have ever read please buy this book you will not regret it."
4,cut through the beginning,When I first started reading this book I didn't expect the long essays on the authors beliefs or philosophical ponderings to be inluded in this novel. After forcing my way through this somewhat exhausting beginning I arrived at the main part of the story and was very quickly addicted to reading this book. Martel's fascinating description of the the human vs. animal vs. nature conflicts that develop are superbly written and with the conversation at the end the reader deeply questions all. Hopefully I'm not saying too much so we'll just leave it at that. If you can force your way through the beginning prepare to be very pleasantly surprised.
2,This book will NOT make you believe in God.,"A major disappointment. The story is hyped as something to ""make you believe in God."" However, in truth the story is shallow and dull. The charactors are cardboard. The elegent storytelling fails to make the reader feel Pi's loss when the ship goes down, or his terror or pain as awaited rescue never comes. The ""surprise ending"" was a major disappointment, the alternative story line even more fantastic then the original. Ultimately the book gives you the impression of a shallow writer attempting to write a ""deep"" story and woefully failing in the task."
1,not my thing,"I picked up Life Of Pi because it is such a popular book. I just could not get into it though. I really liked the author's descriptive and straightforward narrative, but the plot/theme was just not for me i guess. Definitely give it a shot, but maybe get it at the library first."
1,doxie007,"I will get right to the point -- to me, reading this novel was like reading a transcript of someone's nightmare. Although I usually agree with critics, I do not see what all of the commotion is concerning Life of Pi. I finished reading within three days, only because it really bothers me not to finish something I started... and maybe I had some hope that the book would turn out to be worth the money I spent on the hardcover version. I would not recommend this novel to anyone, in fact, I would warn them against it!!"
3,Not the Best Mann-Booker I've Read,"I can't say I found as much in Life of Pi as I have in Roddy Doyle, J.M. Coetzee or Pat Barker, but I can't exactly dismiss it either. Pi's religious issues, his binary issues, and his species issues are all entertaining. I half heartedly looked for representations but can't say I was interested enough in Pi to go on. Compared to Coetzee and the characters from Disgrace or Barker's the Ghost Road (Mann-Booker winners), Pi doesn't stay with a reader long enough for deeper introspection. I thought the algae island and the two boat dialogs the highlight of the book."
4,"Very good, not great","LIFE OF PI is one of my wife's favorite books, which is why I read it. I enjoyed it very much. It is very well written and engaging, but in the end, I didn't find it especially moving or memorable. Well constructed, yes. Creative, yes. Worth reading, yes. Great, no.(My last Booker Prize winner was THE BLIND ASSASSIN by Margaret Atwood--also Canadian; LIFE OF PI was a big improvement!)"
3,took awhile to get into,"Overall this was a pretty good book. It took me awhile to get into though. The author writes really well, and this helps when the book gets drawn out. I wasn't a big fan of the story, until the very end, it really wrapped up nicely."
2,AWFUL BOOK AND VERY BORING,I found this tale extremely well written but also very boring and gruesome. I almost 'gave up the ship' and ditched this book several times but plodded thru-I was not rewarded for my efforts. The ending did not make me believe in god at all as the cover suggests but in the brutality of man in a survival situation.
1,What a waste of time...,"What a waste of a good snowy weekend to read. I was a little skeptical of the book based on the prologue but decided to stick with it anyway. It was so boring, repetitive, and how many different ways can the author describe interactions with the tiger and fishing for food?? I have never been compelled to write a review before, but this book did it for me. i would have had better time spent reading old National Enquirers!!"
3,God must have gone down with the ship,"This book might as well have been published in two volumes: the religious awakening of the beginning, and the subsuquent survival at sea. My problem with the book is that the two are essentially unconnnected. Occasional refereneces to God and prayer were made during Pi's journey, but they were felt like an afterthought. Personally, I felt nothing spiritual while reading the book.Having said that, the descriptive and visceral prose describing Pi's adventure is captivating. It shows that abhorrent acts can become second nature to a person who is desperate. I just don't think that this message, which has been done before, is important enough to garner the level of praise that this book has received."
5,"Wonderful, in every sense of the word",One of the greatest novels by a Canadian ever written. A masterpiece.
5,What a great play on imagination.,My brother and I just lost our Mother. I highly reccremended this book to him as a reprieve from the loss and departure of our Mom. What a beautiful book to through between us: Me being an atheist and him a devout Christian.
5,Amazing story!!,"I loved this story!! Although it was a little slow at first, it definitely picked up on the second half. Its a scary thought being lost and alone by yourself but he had more than enough courage to survive. Some details were very graphic so hope you have a strong stomach. We all have the fight for survival in us and this is his story!"
5,this really could be a true story,Illustrated edition was very cool if you read the book without the movie book companion. Recommend reading after High School to comprehend full meaning of the book. Excellent writing by the author. Can't imagine many people that would not like this book if they are interested in adventure
2,Simple story dragged out,The book is written in 2 parts that did not gel. Is there a connection between his search for religion and his hallucinations that take up the bulk of the pages?
3,Three point one four one five nine...,That's how many starts this book should get.The life of the digits that make up pi would be more exciting.
4,"Not great literature nor profound philosophy, but a good read.","Chose this because I'd just seen the movie. The film pretty much follows the novel faithfully. Terrific job by director Ang Lee in making a breathtakingly beautiful film of it. Reading the book won't get you any deeper into Martel's philosophy on God and life, nor will Lee's film, but both are good rides. If you read/see one, you don't need to see/read the other."
3,A delightful story,A delightful story. The ending is a bit odd. Haven't quite figured out what it all means but I'm glad I read it.
5,A Great Read,"I am generally a very unsatisfied reader. I usually confine myself to ""classics"" or books that will enable me to learn about this subject or that subject. These make for long reads with much delay in between sittings. However, at the airport yesterday, I picked up this book because I had read about it in Time or Newsweek or some other publication so it qualified at least as timely. I allowed myself to be pulled in by Martel's hypnotic prose and was so captivated that I awoke early this morning to finish off the rest of the book.I won't try and delve into the inner meanings of this book, although they are fun to think about as you read. This book is enjoyable on many different levels. It is a very easy and quick read, and I can't say enough about the author's skill with words. The passages are beautiful and fun. If you feel like a light read with some heavy overtones that you can think about when you wish without becoming bogged down in them, this book is for you."
5,Captivating and inspiring!!!!,The writer painted a picture with words that put me right there. I really enjoyed the trip. I recommend this to anyone with a sense of adventure and a flexible framework of faith.
4,A book that stays with you,"I re-read Life of Pi recently in preparation for seeing the film and I remembered why I fell in love with it in the first place. Although the first part is quite slow starting, there are some hilarious moments - especially the parts with the three religious leaders. But the book really comes into its own after the ship wreck. Although not a lot happens plot-wise I found the story completely gripping, and I read it pretty much in one sitting.If you have seen the film without reading the book, you are missing out, because although the film was very faithful and was spectacular to look at on screen, the book has so much more to give. It is a story that will leave you reflecting on life, spirituality, love and story-telling and it is both humorous and heart-breaking all in one. If you haven't read it already you should make it your top priority!"
1,What Am I Missing?,"After reading all the reviews you know what the book is about so I won't summarize yet again. I recommended this book to my husband before I read it and he was not enthused at all. He kept plugging and finished it but had nothing good to say about it. I read the reviews and thought he just didn't know a good thing. Then I read it and I realized he did know what he was talking about. I struggled to finish it just as he did. During the author's explicit detail describing PI eating everthing from turtle's warm blood to tiger feces, I continued to question why I was still reading this book. There are so many wonderful books out there to read, don't waste your time on this one."
4,Slow to start,Seeing previews at the movies left me unprepared for the amount of backstory the author includes in the book. That is actually what makes the book superior to any movie. You really get to know the depth of the main character and his stuggle to simply understand all points of faith. Inspirational. Stick with it and you will be rewarded!
4,Wow what a story!,What a wonderful. Tale. I could feel and hear Richard Parker as he growled and stalked about the lifeboat. I will read this book a second time.
4,Really liked the book,"Lots of introspection, not sure I liked the ending though...dont think the movie will be able to adequately convey thebthe book's multitude of emotions"
4,thought provoking,the art of storytelling is taken to new heights in this dramatic tale. I can't wait to see how it is interpreted in film.
4,Uncommon Story,The book is an adventure story at its core but much more in its entirety. The book primarily deals with the an Indian boys life growing up and centers on a singular event (a shipwreck) that he relates in his later years to a writer looking for new material. I found the observations concerning the major world religions made by the author as he describes the boys early years extremely insightful. The shipwreck an its aftermath are absorbing and some of the best page turning material that I've read in years. I highly recommend this book.
2,Didn't enjoy it.,The beginning was super slow. I felt like it was difficult to get through. Didn't enjoy it all that much.
5,Life of Pi,"I liked the survival, the will to live, facing adversity. I LIKED the animal content but descriptions of the animals' torment was difficult to read ."
3,Life of Pi,"The stofy in itself is fine. The paperback edition is small, not a comfotable one to handle, but the type is good size and dark. We older folks, even after cataract surgery amd with glasses, like dark type with decent leding."
5,Amazing book!,This book is such a good read. It feels so good after you read a good book and this book certainly kept me interested the entire time.
2,Plagiarism or inspiration,The concept and most of the narrative comes from a book written 10 years earlier by Scliar. Many people think that Martell only copied the previous work. I think his writing made for a more interesting book. Any way it is plagiarism.
3,"Overall good, but slow","Pi is a fabulous character and y o u really get to know and care for him. The plot was slow and I thought, from all the hype the book is getting, it would be a real p age Turner."
3,Thought Provoking,"Food for thought.Very detailed. Perhaps too much so, as I tended to skip over paragraphs to get to the next bit.But it is thought provoking as you can literally see life through his eyes and learn new perspectives."
3,Solid Read,I liked the story and the twist ending. Main character is very easy to root for. I recommend to any one needing a theological punch on the shoulder.
3,Just ok,I thought I could read this with my kids (9 and 11) but it was way over there head. Not a good fit for us.
5,The Life of Pi,I wanted to live forever in this book. After I finished it I was upset that I must return to the real world and leave Pi and Richard Parker behind !It touches the mind and the soul with humor and IMAGINATION!
3,Cool concept but I don't understand all the fuss,Points for uniqueness but it was a bit of a battle to get through. Guess it wasn't quite for me!
3,Life of pi,I enjoyed this book although I am a bit confused about who or what was in the boat. I like to believe that RIchard Parker really was a tiger.
3,Loved the first 3/4's of the book.,"...But after that not so much as the author seemed to go on drugs and fall off the edge of the world. I couldn't even finish it at first and had to go back and make myself do it. I should not have bothered. But the first three quarters of the book was wonderful, especially with the authors infusing of his main character with the knowledge of wildlife experience he possesed. No question this author KNEW his subject when it comes to wild animals.This is a book that needs rewriting with a much better last quarter! Based on what I read I did not even think of going to see the film."
2,life of Pi,The Author does not keep it interesting I don't feel I am involved in the story life of pi may be a good movie
1,Didn't care for it.,"It was very strange and how I they ever made a movie out of it, I can't imagine. They must have taken a lot of ""literary"" license."
3,It's okay,"I was expecting more. It was a little gruesome. The ending was a little disappointing, as well. I'm hoping the movie might be better."
3,May not live up to expectations,"I took this after knowing that a Yang Lee decided to make a picture based on this, so I had lots of expectations. But I just managed to finish the book without any curiosity and just because I had to !"
2,blah!,This book was gruesome and poorly written. The beginning hooks you in with promises of a new found belief in god from the man's story. What the heck? I must've missed where that epiphany comes to be. If the movie is ANYTHING like the book (normally not the case as we all know) I don't know why anyone would want to watch it. Eww!
2,Life of Pi hard to get into,"I haven't even finished reading the book. The beginning is so very boring I just had to put it down. I will finish it some day. Still not finished. I am up to pages 600 and it is totally boring. I was told that the movie's first half hour is boring, but then finally gets interesting. And,great! It has disappeared from my ipad."
2,THIS BOOK IS GRAPHIC,"When i read this book for summer reading in high school i was shocked by the graphic nature of the violence portrayed while pi is marooned on a life boat with several animals, or at least sveral animals for a time being. The book goes into such detail over the deaths over these animals i was sickened for the remainder of the book and could not appreciate the underlying meanings. However, if You take away those chapters you do have a decent book on your hands. I reccomend you skip those chapters when you come across them as they truly are sickening. And this is coming from a guy whose favorite show is the walking dead..."
5,Life of Pi - What a treasure,Although the Life of Pi is a little hard to get into (it took me about 75 pages to get hooked) it is worth the time! What a treasure of a book! A sixteen year old boy and his love of religion - quite a surprize. A philisophical surprize that you don't want to miss.
3,"Interesting read, disappointing end",The story sets off nicely. I like the author's way of thinking and he seems to have an amazing understanding of animal psychology. I also liked the references on religion. But that was until half of the book. After that nothing new adds in and the end is really disappointing.
3,Get past the beginning and its ok,"I can not agree with the critics who shower praise on the life of Pi. The first 30 pages are not very engaging and mediocrity describes the first 89 pages. The middle to end is worth the push though, as the prose becomes more driving and purposeful. While some people claim that this book will make you believe in God - I find this a strange assertion... it had no effect on my belief system and I found its anectodal ending amusing but not as deeply philosophical as I was lead to believe through other reviews. There is no doubt the Yann Martel is a talented writer, but it seems he tries too hard in the beginning- like a graduate student writing his/her first novel. Nonetheless his description of the tiger towards the end shows the incredible promise of this young author."
4,A Surprise,"""Life of Pi"" is not what it seems to be. Well writen and crafted, the story itself isgreatly entertaining; the author paints with words, his words easily visualized.We come to know the character, (who calls himself 'Pi'), as though he were ourinner selves. Pi is a resouceful, well taught pilgrim, and his adventure, outlandishand frightening, becomes our own.But the ending of ""Life of Pi"" is what is the surprise, and we find ourselves thinkingback to Aesop and his fables.A wonderul, delightful tale."
4,Very Good and Touching,"I liked the book and loved the writer's style. Yann Martel has an amazing style of writing - almost poetic. Very descriptive and as odd as the situation of being alone on a boat with a tiger seems, is actually believable. I recommend this book."
5,pleased,"It was an unusual book, but kept my interest and had a wonderful plot. I applaud the author."
3,So-so book,"I ventured out of my usual kind of reads for this book because of all the hype. It sounded kinda interesting. When I read the blurbs on it, I was expecting some kind of big epiphany from it. I'm disappointed in it, it was just a weird story that dragged on, and the back and forth in time thing was confusing. I've read other books with that technique that flowed well and were easy to follow. I am giving it three stars because Mr. Martel can obviously write, no shortage of talent there. There is also a decent amount of creativity in his book. The third star is me admitting that I bought this book because of the hype, so I won't punish it because it's not my usual taste. Honestly, the story is not that interesting, a lot of the scenes seemed pointless, and the big message of the book comes across weak and contrived. Like someone shoved it in hoping it would leave you in awe. It doesn't. I really don't get the big hoopla here. Wasn't time well-spent for me."
5,TERRIFIC,Probably the best read I've had in years.I could picture many of the episodes in my mind' eye.they should make a movie of this book.
5,Pi is not a mystical number,"I'm amazed at the scathing criticism I've read here. This book doesn't deserve it . Forget about the awards, just read the story and take the time to imagine the scenes in detail, remember that this is a tale, a tale of survival from someone with a different tradition of story telling. Consider the interesting side trips on zoo-keeping and animals and the search for meaning through religion. Above all, remember your geometry -- pi is the circumference of ANY circle divided by its diameter, a non-terminating never repeating decimal that is classified by mathematicians as irrational and transcendental but NOT mystical. Pi is more than just a nickname here."
4,Life of Pi,Excellent read. Good lead up to the movie for those who were unaware of this book. Spelling and punctuation does tend to be a problem on most kindle books though.
3,Only ok,The story is quite grabbing but I found myself skipping a lot of pages particularly in the beginning and when his philosophy on religion etc was written about.
3,Life of Pi,"It was an interesting read. Not normally something that I would read, but it was ok. I am interested in watching the movie now."
3,"Overall, a good book","This book was a very unique, inspiring, moving one overall. Some parts were quite dull, while others very intriguing, balancing out overall. Do not recommend for those who get sick easily, but, once again, a very good book overall!"
3,Interesting,Interesting book written with a lot of imagination. Truly makes you appreciate what you have and opens up your mind to new ideas.
5,Fact or fiction?,"This book fascinated me from beginning to end.Yes, is it fact or fiction? Is it a true story?I am still wondering. I read the book first then sawthe moving in 3D. Both most enjoyable"
4,A good book,"It was a good book - sometimes the plot slowed, but overall, the story is incredible. I think this would make an excellent study book for a high school or college lit class. Lots of things to think about in this book."
4,Adventurous story of survival,Difficult to read and follow at first but I enjoyed reading this story of spiritual battles and the battle to survive lost at sea of this young Indian man. Excellent read
4,Interesting Reading,Didn't know if I would like it but I did very much. Interesting and unusual story. I had a hard time putting it down.
2,A slow read!,"Despite the reviews I previously read for this book, I found it dull, long, and boring. Despite this,I managed to read my way to the end."
2,Hard to get into.,I finally gave up and quit the book before the fifth chapter. It goes on and on for chapters just telling you how the main character got his name. Boring.
3,Life of pictures,It was a little wordy and drug out. Good story but not a must read. Too many graphic gory details.
3,An ok read,"The beginning was very slow, if it hadn't been on at the movies at the time I may not have carried on, interesting ending."
4,Good read,Great read. Slow at some points. Worth the time. Once you get through the boring religion chapters in the beginning it's good
4,Life of Pi,My wife actually read this book and is excited for me to read it. She couldn't stop talking about it while reading it and could hardly put it down. She now has a real fear of getting on a boat.
4,Life of pi,Delightfully written story full of wonderful reflections on human and animal natures. A masterpiece of magical literature. Full of food for thought.
5,Outstanding,"I cannot stress enough how amazing this book is - I'm telling anyone who will listen. I will say that the first 50 or so pages were a struggle for me to get through, but you end up appreciating it later on as the story develops. Stick with it - you'll thank yourself!"
4,Worth reading,Life of Pi with its great ending is really worth reading. I'll be recommending it for years to come.
4,Known to all as Pi Patel,Delightful. Everytime I go over this book in my mind I find these extraneous pieces of information that only fit when you've completed the book. The book is certainly no mystery.It only takes 96 pages before Pi is stranded at sea. And 180 pages of it locked into a compromising situation with a Bengal Tiger. The first 100 feel like a primer on Indian culture and life on first read. But they lay a foundation. They make so much of Pi's later behavior believable.And the last 20 pages? You're no longer sure which story to believe. Both are plausible. Both incredible. Only one took ten times as many pages to write.Outstanding.
5,GREAT,I thought this book was fabulous! It was a fairly easy read and held my attention throughout. I didn't want it to be over. It's one of those books that I would read over again. I would highly recommend it to anyone!
2,I must be missing something here.,"I will grant you that Life of Pi is well written, with some amazingly fresh and effective language. But the story is thin, overly long, and not terribly interesting, and certainly not plausible, even when the true nature of events is revealed. It took a long time to say very little, and didn't ""speak to me"" at all."
5,Will be a classic,"This story is incredibly readable, highly creative, yet almost believeable. It is like a cross between a religious parable, a folk tale, and a Rudyard Kipling animal tale. Fascinating and original. Don't pass up this one."
1,Graphic Imagery and it aint nice either,"The first 1/3 of the book had me interested, but by the end I was so appalled and affected by the graphic imagery of the killings that occurred in the story, all of which soured and tainted the entire experience for me. If you enjoy blood and guts described in graphic detail for more than 150 pages, you will enjoy this book. This book, as the character Pi says... sinks to the lowest level of human savagery"". Don't waste your money on this book, if you're dying to read it, check it out for free at the library, it aint worth the paper it's printed on, Mr Martel."
1,numb,This is a very gruesome story which has little to do with God. It would have been better without the last few chapters. There is very little mention of religion after the shipwreck. The book actually deals more with the dark side of man. Yuck.
3,An Interesting Read. . .,"Be prepared for a slow opening. The exposition section of the book is sometimes rather heavy going and concentrates a great deal upon his background and spiritual journey. Once he is on the ship and ultimately on the boat with the tiger, the pace accelerates although it continues to be thoughtful. I liked the book, but I did not find it to be a spiritual book which is generally the way it is promoted. I think the spiritual element is present, but does not necessarily dominate as much as I expected. The descriptions are particularly well written and, at times, almost lyrical.I enjoyed the book, but it would not be my first choice in a novel to read.kittynix"
5,Fascinating fiction!,A very unique book - although it is believed that it has been inspired by another book. Very well written. A page turner that kept me engaged.
4,Respect,"This book was a surprise even after reading the reviews and descriptions. Martel created characters, both human and otherwise, who were believable and consistent with themselves and with nature in general. He treats all of his characters with great respect for their natural integrity. I expected at some time an unreal breakthrough, warm and fuzzy, but it never came, as it rarely would in real life. This is not warm and fuzzy! Parts are very brutal, but THE LIFE OF PI is never boring nor predictable. Great book, especially for animal lovers."
4,great story of a boy against nature strengthened by faith,"excellent adventure that ties in survival instincts, unlikely bonds, and faith. started out a bit slow and finished on the top. a fantastic satisfying ending."
5,Simplistic Genius,"When teaching life lessons, you can take an entire course and get an entire degree in some things, but never learn the essential ingredient. Then, comes along a proverb, or a parable, so simple, yet it ingrains in your mind forever. It's not the size of the book, but the heart within it. In that sense, this book reminds me a lot of the book, ""The Little Guide To Happiness"". A stupid little thing, but packed with wisdom."
4,What a story,"This book is wonderful. It is a beautifully written story so satisfying and wonderous, that you are immediately taken in by Pi Patel and his monumentally heroic, heartbreaking, uplifting, and amazing struggle for survival with and against Richard Parker, (a full grown bengal tiger).The most wonderful bonus to this already fantasic novel, is the ending, which I will not give away."
3,"Engaging, but flawed.","Martel weaves an intriguing story of survival and faith in clean, skillful prose. A decidedly enjoyable read, with moments of wonderful humor and insight. And yet, I can't help but feel that the book is a bit overrated. It definitely does not live up to its (somewhat gimmicky and self-congratulatory) promise that it will ""make you believe in God."" There is a wink-wink-nudge-nudge self-consciousness to the writing that keeps this book from entering the ranks of magical realism masterpieces by writers like Garcia Marquez or Vonnegut."
3,I am not sure I got this one???,I enjoyed reading this book but I have the nagging feeling that it had a profound message and I didn't get it.
4,An interesting look at the human mind and heart,"This is an incredibly colorful novel that takes you away into a fantastic world. It makes for an easy read that will make you smile. It has an amazing ending, which will have you thinking for a while after you finish reading."
4,"Magical, for most of it.","I loved the first and last third of this book. A fresh voice of a boy with an inspiring view on our world of religion opens the book, and closes it..... but what happened in the middle?It seems Martel got too caught up in the gore and survival to remember how he made the reader fall in love in with his character.Beside this fatal flaw, this book is 5-star deserving."
3,Pi,"This book was for a small local discussion group.The read was engaging and our subsequent group discussion went in many intriguing directions:religion/spirituality vs. dogma, imagination, willingness to suspend belief, storytelling. ""The Life of Pi"" is worth reading as it certainly is a well-told story.If anyone can explain ""the island"", my book group would really appreciate some closure there."
3,Too introspective and fantastic. I was bored,"I was disappointed in the plot or lack thereof. It was not interesting. I would not recommend the book to my friends. I love using my Kindle Touch. I have read more, faster for entertainment than any other time in my life. I have used the Kindle for about 60 days."
3,Amazing detail,"Enjoyed heaps although slow in some parts, didn't want to put down during others. Detail is amazing and makes you forget it's fiction. Worth reading."
3,Not what I expected,"Sometimes when the expectation is too high, the satisfaction is not so great. I think that was what happen when I read this book. It is a good story but a little boring in the middle. It is a good book to read, if your expectations are not that high."
5,Grea,OutstandingMarvellous need extension plz extension I have too per bye fair well this book is so good I loved it
3,Hard to start,This is a nice story after you pass the first fundraiser of the book. Now time to check the movie.
2,Praise be to God - make it end!,"Like many, I found the beginning of the book to be engaging. A very good look at various religions, differences therein and how to tackle rejection of the various ideas. It is also a fascinating bit of delivery for animal behavior and information. This is where it falls apart.You are vaguely aware that there is metaphor throughout but the story bogs down in massive detail for a story that matters very little in the end. Unfortunately you need to decide in the end if the desire was a religious introspection or animals as a metaphor for life.Sadly the narrative at the end drops into simplistic sentence structure that kills any interest you may have had left.When it is all done they wrap it up and let you know that events occurred and there are no concrete answers. Maybe that is what you are supposed to take from the whole experience. Mostly, I just pray to God I never have to read this again."
5,Life of Pi - loved it,"Book started out slow, very spiritual. As soon as Pi lands in the lifeboat with the zebra, hyena and tiger, the pace picks up dramatically and off it goes. The reader was very engaging."
4,Life of Pi,At first the lead in was a little drawn out but once you get into the book more it helps you to understand better because of the way he writes. Right now I am at about chapter 90 and the reading is pretty good and it is holding my interest better.
5,Inspiring extraordinary,Hard to put down. At one point I laughed. Other times it was hard not to cry. Heart breaking. I highly recommend this. Will see the movie and cry.
2,Life of Pi,"I was bothered by Pi's deep hunger for God being treated so passively by his family. Just when the story begins to take shape, it all seems to turn to symbolism in an effort by his mind to deal with the tragedies. It left me feeling empty and uninspired."
3,I haven't been able to read the book,I saw this on a tv commercial l thought it looked interesting so when I received my new kindle fire it was my first book.
2,Great movie...slow book!,"I loved the movie, but I could not get through the book. Very slow reading and I finally gave up."
3,Not for Children!!!,"i loved this book, but I don't think it should be in the ""children's section."" There are a few parts that are scary and VERY gory! over 15 would be a good age to read this"
4,Life of Pi,"Life of Pi is a brilliantly written book. The first part of the novel deals, I think with to much religious material which seems to be unconnected to the rest of the book. But the second section of the book is amazing in the authors ability to sustain tension in a compelling way for so many chapters. Pi's ingenuity, courage and intelligence are a reflection of the author's command of his suject matter. After the first section, the book is impossible to put down, so give it a chance and you will be rewarded."
5,The Life of Pi,"Once I started reading it, I found any time I could to get back to it. I thought it was fascinating. The ending was very interesting. Can't wait to see the movie now."
4,Philosophical and interesting read that tends to drag in places,"Life of Pi is a captivating story. I began reading this book on and off when I was in high school and they happened to have it in our school's library. I never finished it while I was there and it took me more than five years to come back to it. It was even better than I remembered it. I was also impressed by how closely the movie adaptation followed the book.Parts of the story dragged, but that is realistic given the story line.I would recommend this book to those interested in philosophy and/or religion, as well as to young adult readers."
2,After Chapter 19 I was bored!,"I rally thought this book would be interesting given the plot description. However, after about Chapter 12, there is too much religious description and asides that don't add to the story. If the religious stuff had been worked into the plot rather than having separate descriptive chapters, it would have moved the story along but the way it is written here is plodding and dull. These chapters stop the story and we have to wait until the author is done philisophizing to come back to the narrative."
5,Had a hard time putting it down,The first person narrative really puts you in the harrowing story of Pi. I've been meaning to read this book for years but just never picked it up. I was recently motivated when the film version was released. I was very pleasantly surprised that the movie followed the book and held true to the story.
4,Enthralling start to finish.,"Life of Pi was an amazing story of so many different yet connected things. Childhood, zoology, religion, ecosystems...the writer puts you there with not only eyes but with all of your senses. I must say that the ending quite threw me."
4,Amazing story of survival,loved every page of this book. i wonder why i waited so long to read it. it was worth it though. i will be watching the movie
4,Fascinating but hard to read in parts...,"I love the ""voice"" of the narrator, Pi. Innocent, wise, wry, gentle, strong. A singular read, with great humanity and philosophical overtones. Well worth the effort!"
1,Creepy and Disturbing,"I, like many others, was forced to read this book in Junior High School. It is a creepy and disturbing book that haunted my dreams for months. Do not give this book to your children! It displays a callous attitude towards death and psychological trauma. DO NOT RECOMMEND."
1,Prompt response,Seller took full responsibility for book that arrived with a black ink strip on the pages and promptly authorized a refund. This kind of integrity is rare and appreciated.
1,TOTAL RIP OFF : The book never came!,My book never came TO ME. According to Amazon's tracking feature some person signed for my package on a day NO-ONE WAS EVEN HOME AT MY HOUSE. I emailed the company and did not receive any kind of reply. The service is absolutely terrible!
1,Package Not Recieved,"I ordered my books on August 11th 2010. My estimated arrival date was August 16th 2010. It is not August 19th 2010 and i still have not received the books that I ordered. On the tracking of the package, It says it is in transit in the same place since August 13th. Amazon has taken my money and I don't have my books and I have no way of notifying anyone or getting my money back. That is why I made this review. Hopefully someone will see this and can help me!"
1,Nice concept but the writing puts me to sleep,"I think the idea for the story has so much promise, but every time I start reading this book I fall asleep. It's extremely slow to get started and after three times of conking out with this book and I'm only about 10 pages into it, I just said forget it. Obviously, there's a missing ingredient. I don't know what it is but when I really like a book, I stay awake to read it instead of falling into a coma like this one does to me. Maybe it's too conceptual. I don't know. Not enough action? Meandering prose? I can tell already it's trying to have some deeper symbolic meaning and maybe that is what's getting in the way of the author just telling the tale? Your mileage may vary and obviously a lot of people really liked it. Just not the one for me."
3,Survival,"The book was well written and it uses etremely vivid imagery which may catch you off guard if your faint at heart. There are some pretty gory details but if that doesn't bother you, it's actually a good story. A bit on the depressing side but the book shows you that no matter how bad life get's you can survive if you just keep the faith and never give up. It also shows you that although things might be a mess for you in life, they can get a whole lot worse and they can get a whole lot better too."
5,"smart, deep and surprising book","This book is one of the most interesting I have read in a long time. The premise made me stop what I was doing and buy it on the spot.A man and a tiger are stranded together on a lifeboat. How do they survive?I won't present the reader with plot details or a synopsis of the story here. Many other reviewers have already done a fine job of that. I will say that after having finished this book in a very short time, it was impossible to put down, I can report that it was everything I wanted it to be and more. The writing is smart, deep and even surprising at times...Get this book and read it. as the author says in the beginning... it's a story that will make you believe in God.I already believe in God, but now I believe in a new author as well. Can't wait until I read his next book."
1,CDs got me through,I'm in a book club and this was the latest pick - that's the only reason I kept with this book. Plus everyone kept raving about how amazing it was.It took me 2 weeks to get to page 62 - I can usually whip through books that grab me very quickly. I knew I wasn't going to get through the book so I got the CDs. 9 CDs ... over 11 hours. I now know how Pi felt as it feels like I've been trying to get through this book for 227 days.The author is very descriptive - delightfully so in some places. But there's sooooooooooo much description. I don't need to know every minute detail about everything.
3,Entertaining but not serious Literature,"This book is well written with a good plot. But I would dismiss any statement claiming more than that. It does not deliver profound philosophy or ethical discussion. It just seems to attend the average story-telling of our times, some shallow moral discussion combined with the much needed violent twists. I won't be surprised if someone makes a film of it real soon, It will apply perfectly."
1,Awful,I am embarassed that I spent money on this audio book. Life of Pi is a mixed up story that never finds it way.
2,Do not see movie or read book,"Because of the animal cruelty , book should not be purchased or movie should not be seen - Tiger is beautiful but cruelty is horrible - not for children or any age"
5,Pi is the Guy!,"This is an excellent tale of a young man's adventure. It hits the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of the events that take place. I would recommend this book to anyone from teen to mature adult. The author has a unique style of writing and engages you and makes you feel part of the tale.Buy this! Borrow it! But definitely read this amazing book!"
1,Disappointing is an Understatement,"After reading so many positive reviews of this book, I went right out and purchased it. It was a mistake. I kept thinking there had to be some redeeming quality. After reading about a goat being given in sacrifice to a large predator to teach children a lesson, a zebra with a broken leg being eaten alive from the inside out and a detailed description of collecting and eating tiger feces by Pi, I think the author should take up another line of work and the people who gave it the Man Brooker Prize should be fired."
3,"Sorry, not a great read","This was an OK book. I was suckered into buying it because Amazon thought if I liked Bel Canto, I'd like this book. This was no Bel Canto, by a LONG shot. I did like parts (the zoo minutiae especially) but found myself skipping over page after page about 2/3 through. It became a grudge match. What on earth did all the religious stuff (to which I am not averse)have to do with the rest of the book?"
1,Check it out from library... Do not waste money,"I could not finish it. I did not like the narrative at all. It was slow and just lost me after about 50 pages...If you are not sure, please check out the book from a library so that you do not waste your money on this book. I regret paying 10 bucks on it..."
1,Pi-thetic!!!,"Boy, tiger, boat - blah.A long, circuitous fairy tale puffed up with psychological and psuedo-religious drivel paraded as an ""important"" novel. Tied with ""Wild Animus"" for the worst book I have ever read."
1,Not worth the time,"The story is 100% fiction, despite the introduction's assertion of the opposite. I had to skim about 100 pages before the plot thickened, so to speak, and then discovered in research after finishing that the whole story line is fiction. If I had known that from the beginning, the plot would always have remained thin.For people who are short on time and truly need their book reading time to mean something, choose another book."
5,How can anyone make this up?,"I just finished reading this book as part of a school project and I was, in all honesty, not very much impressed by... the first half of it. True, it is a happy and interesting story of a confused boy. But this book only starts to MEAN something once you read the third part. Not wishing to spoil anything for anyone, I won't reveal anything about the contents, but I can tell you, even if the first parts of the book seem a bit conventional (although it is wonderfully fresh storytelling), the third Part will make you want to read the book over, and over and over. I actually suggest you do this.Simply amazing, it had me all nerves from the Third Part onward."
4,Fantastic read!,"Such a good read. Starts off a bit slow, but stick with it and you will be rewarded with a story of hope, perseverance, faith and ingenuity."
4,Very enjoyable,The author has an amazing imagination and kept me interested the whole way through. I can't wait to see the movie! I heard it's excellent too.
4,Engrossing survival tale marred (slightly) by author's viewpoints,The tale of the protagonist's survival after the shipwreck in which lost his family is unique and engrossing. It shows how a person's beliefs and behavior change when he has to confront tough choices for survival. The description of Pi's life in Pondicherry where his father owns a zoo is also interesting.Couple of things I did not like about the story- The injection of the author's views about animals' life in zoos and the odd way that faith/atheism is mentioned towards the conclusion of the book.- The snippets of Pi meeting some one in Canada present randomly throughout the book.
1,Huge disappointment!,"In spite of the great reviews for this book, it is probably the only audio book that I have purchased and decided not to finish. I just did not find it enjoyable at all. I kept hoping it would get better, but by Chapter 46, I gave up. The detailed, gruesome deaths of the animals was disturbing to me."
2,Couldn't wait to finish,"I found this book boring. Im sorry. Yann Martel fills the book with lists of stuff instead of just writing. A third of the way through the book, I found myself hoping that it would end quickly. I know this is not a popular view of this book, but its the truth. I dont see how everyone thinks that there was some sorta incitefull meaning. I really didn't get anything from this book. The only entertaining part of this whole book was the floating island and the translation of the Japanese conversation at the end of the book."
2,Nice Story but Overrated,"This book is a nice fiction story of a boy who is castaway with some Zoo animals. Interesting point of view on Zoo animals and how animals and Humans can learn to live with each other.However, I did not find it motivating at all. Will not help you if you are trying to find something which shakes you up and forces you to think about life."
1,author has no regard for reality,"Life of Pi... I heard so many wonderful comments about this book that it baffles me how seemingly intelligent people can recommend this poorly written story.The author has no regard for reality, if one really wants to learn about survival at sea, then I highly recommend ADRIFT by Steven Callahan, who actually survived 76 days at sea.Life of Pi is full of unnecessary gore, tedius explanations and ubnoxious narration.Save your money. Life of Pi is a waste of paper, ink, and moreover, precious time."
3,From a High School Freshmans Perspective,"Life of Pi is a very interesting book once you get past the beginning. In the whole first part of the book, I had to force myself to read it. I would have stopped if the book was not assigned for school. Yann wrote about topics as if he had just watched a show on The Animal Planet and wanted to tell us about why animals did certain things like escaping from their enclosure. But after I got past that part, which put me to sleep. I could not stop reading. He describes Pi's adventure with so much detail that it was practically a movie in the form of words. He really gives a lot of personality to the tiger; Richard Parker. Richard Parker is such a huge role and I think it is very hard to describe an animal's personality with such detail.If you can get past the first part of the book, you will enjoy the rest of the story. All i can say is that Yann wrote with so much detail that it ties you to the two main characters, Richard Parker and Pi."
2,Why has my previous negative review of this book been deleted?,This was not a very good book. It is a book about telling stories for others and not for yourself as true religioun would have to satisfy. A boy giving explicit and meaningless details about his fantasy experience should not be satisfying to most intelligent readers. Meaningless details which exist only to prove a story that the boy makes up. 227 days has no meaning what so ever.So we see a character who KNOWS his story is just a story. That would be called a lie by most.
4,Nice read!,"The beginning is a little boring, but once he begins the adventure, it is very exciting and interesting! It is not on my top ten list, but it is a nice read. Recommended for teens and young adults."
4,A totally engrossing novel,"Yann Martel creates a lively world easy to inhabit. You live, love and suffer along with the main character Piscine Molitar Patel. Written as if it were a true story of a castaway, the author doesn't gloss over the brutality of a young man in a desperate situation. While some of the details are hard to believe by the end of the book, you find yourself in the same shoes as an interviewer who would rather believe the story is true than think the journey was for naught."
4,Beautiful and scary!,"This book was both beautiful & sometimes a little scary, the only problem I had with it was the religion in it as I am not a religious person."
2,Not worth the time!,When I finished the book I was upset with myself for wasting my time. I woluld not recommend this book!
2,boring,"just all about religion and extremely boring, i am so sorry that i bought it. wish I could get a refund"
2,Disappointed,"After the review of ""it will make you believe in God"" I was looking forward to an interesting story. I loved the beginning about zoology and religion, but the lost at sea part seemed rather boring and dragged at times and then the surprise ending was just disturbing and abrupt. I cant recommend it."
1,Life of Pi,"I found Life of Pi to be a garbled piece of inconsequential ramblings, rather than the story I expected. After trudging through the first two chapters, I gave up on the so called story, something I have only done on extremely rare occasions. Unless you enjoy the masochism of relevant religious rantings, I do not suggest wasting either your money or your time on this book."
1,Very Graphic,"This book was difficult to get into. After, it was extremely graphic in violence and survival techniques. I found it painful to read and if it hadn't been a book club necessity I would have quit many times."
5,Life of Pi,"A little slow at first but all makes sense when you reach Part 2. Amazing story, after reading the book I visited the zoo with a whole new perspective on the animals."
4,interesting and different,I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. It was interesting enough to keep me reading to the end. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys something different. It's like nothing I've ever read before.
4,Liked the book a lot,"Unlike many people, I was not that interested in the religious themes, but they didn't bother me either. I really like the reflection on how our stories contribute to our identity, to our own mythology, and how they may or may not depart from ""reality"". I wish the relations between the two versions had been more central to the book. Some passages are very ""graphic"" and some a bit over the top, but most are very touching, intriguing and thought-provoking. That said, I enjoyed the book a lot, was eager to keep reading, and can't wait to see the movie adaptation. I recommend it warmly."
4,Life of Pi review,I enjoyed the humour and the quirky language.One slow patch near the start about the philosophy of religions that could deter some readers before they got into the book but keep reading.
4,Life of Pi review,"Loved it!Couldn't put the book down at the end, as I wanted to see when and how Pi was going to be rescued.What a twist to the story!"
2,Was he kidding??!!,"Dragging, presumptive writing that made you feel that the author found another 'something' to tie his ends to his boring middle to end of his so called story. I was disappointed i the premise and the ending. So Sorry"
5,I would love a second book.,"I really loved this book. I was right there in that boat, missing my family and worried how He was going to feed the tiger."
4,Awesome,"Great fun reading. As they always say, much better than the movie, and this time its true as well. Good book for people of all ages."
4,Surprisingly good,"Winning the Man Booker prize was a slight turn-off for me, and of course there was the much-publicised improbability of a boy and a tiger marooned in a boat. However, out of curiosity, I downloaded the book before deciding on seeing the film. Thank heaven this is not a book written in the present tense - a stylistic trick I particularly hate. The way of introducing the first-person narrative reminds me of many novels of the late 19th century early 20th century. The prose flows easily and the unexpected amount of information on keeping animals in zoos retained my interest. The scenes on the ocean require a certain willing suspension of disbelief and I loved the plot twist. The ending is abrupt, but what else could the author do?"
5,Very Timely,"Pi is the guy I want to be one day- he is a fighter and he never lets go of hope. He quickly learns that everything he needs to survive life is inside of himself. This is a great read for a person that is struggling with making personal changes and finding the true meaning of happiness within their life. I found that I was not only able to connect to Pi, but sometimes I saw myself in Richard Parker. Other times I knew I was the meerkats- all of them. Martel's story reminded me why I must always make reading an important part of my life."
4,Life of pi,Enjoyed reading this book easy reading with little twist at the end. Would have liked to have found out more about picturesque he got off the boat however.
5,A Boy and a Tiger Adrift at Sea? Yep!,"I bought this book while browsing through a book store. I got hooked from the description on the back cover. Then, as I always do, I read Amazon book reviews before reading the book. Several reviewers claimed to have been bored by the pages, and pages, and pages of description devoted to the main character being adrift at sea.I have a differing view in that I did not find it boring at all. I found that I kept reading and the book held my interest from start to finish.To top it all off, the ending was so unexpected and surprising that it made me want to read the book again. I recommend this book highly, but I would not recommend it to my mother or any others with weak stomachs."
2,Very Strange book,I hate to admit I didn't get it...got to the end and was not too sure what I had read. Will try the movie for 3D effects.
2,Disturbing,"The book is full of violent and nauseating images and certainly not for easy reading. I am sorry I bought it and cannot see the movie, however well done."
3,"Captivating book, but with some bits and pieces left out.","This book was a fun, quick read that was enjoyable and kept me intrigued throughout the book. The one thing I did not like about the book was the lack of follow through in the boy's religious beliefs. I was interested to see how he carried these principles with him on his journey, but there was little tie in throughout the rest of the book.Would still recommend the book to anyone."
3,Too Hard to Start,"I almost gave up (my friend threw the book away), but I stayed with it. I can't wait to see how in the world they made a movie out of it!"
2,Life of Pi,"Just couldn't get into this book, and only read the first part of it and knew that it would be a struggle to finish."
2,Not what I was expecting,"A great story of survival, but I was very underwhelmed with how it was told. It seemed to take half the book to even get the story started and some parts went off on tangents that I felt added nothing to the story. I was expecting a different book than the one I got and maybe that was just my own misunderstanding of what I was supposed to get out of the story."
3,Life of Pi,"The beginning of the book was rather slow, had to force myself to continue. It became a lot more interesting when it got into Pi's adventure. Would like to see how the movie was done."
3,Thought Provoking,The book takes a while to get going. I almost put it down. Glad I didn't! What an amazing journey.
2,Life Of Pi,"ok I hope the movie is better than the book because this one is definately a slow read, just can't seem to get into finishing this one."
3,Hits Close To Home,"At first I was mildly disappointed, because I thought it was a children's book, and that's pretty much all I can read. Especially pop-ups. But as I read on, I found this story of a boy, his tiger and a boat to resemble an experience I had with Mr. Bubbles. Except replace tiger with drunken iguana, boat with the Key West HoJo's, and boy with Village Person....but I digress. Very enjoyable!"
4,a great tale!!!,"I thought it was a wonderful story, well written. If it doesn't ""make you believe in God"" it will at least make you think about the divine in eveyday life. Well worth reading."
3,Life of Pi,"This novel came highly praised and recommended by people I have a lot of faith in. The book was somewhat of a disappointment in that I was expecting that a book had won the Booker would be both memorable and enthralling. It was only a little of each. I would say it was more quirky than anything else - and the ending smacked of author manipulation. Would I recommend the book to others? Yes, but with a caveat - don't expect to be blown away. It's a good read, and worth the time and effort, but it won't change your life or ""make you believe in God""."
4,"Overall, I am amazed but I have to mention one flaw","As an agnostic/hopeful skeptic (something that Pi calls ""missing the better story,"")I found Pi's youthful optimism about God and religion to be refreshing in a way. Part one is definitely where the story shines. Martel has a gift when it comes to dialogue. The book's few conversations were probably the most enjoyable part of the book for me. If only authors didn't feel compelled to add thickness to their books and break that 300+ page mark. Part 2 needlessly goes on for too long. I would still highly recommend this book even though the middle is tedious at times. I think I'll give it four and a half stars; the other half star went down the drain when I had to read 50 pages about Pi repeatedly killing various ocean creatures and then hacking them to bits."
3,Didn't exactly blow me away,"Decent book, I expected more considering how much my friend raved all over it. It started out good enough, detailing piscine's life back in India but things begin to bog down a little in the middle. Luckily, the last couple of chapters and the ending make the entire book a worthwhile endeavor. A fable that isn't quite a fable is how I would best describe it."
4,"A decent book, but not worth all the positive hype.","Since it I has been almost a year ago that I read Life of Pi, my review will not be a detailed one. I just want to tell anyone who may begin reading this book that it does move quite slowly in the beginning. If you stick it out, you will be glad you did read it. It leaves everything to the imagination and answers almost nothing. It is not like any other book that I have read, but you will be left with a good feeling in the end."
5,BUY IT!,"This is one of the most fun books ever. Clever, interesting details about international culture, allegorical, an easy reading page-turner, who could ask for more. I didn't want it to end!"
2,"A Poor Man's ""Moby Dick""....","As one previous reviewer wrote, ""WAY,WAY OVERRATED"". This somewhat meandering story didn't engage me, and like many readers, I found no compelling ending to Pi's journey. The emperor has no clothes...."
4,Loved it!,"A bit slow in the beginning,but draws you in... Great character development and twust un the plot, I've recommended it to others."
3,My Thoughts on the Novel,"All and all I enjoyed Life of Pi. However it took me a while to get into it. Part 1 to me was long, and I found it hard to catch my attention. I kept waiting for the real story to start which I think happens in Part 2. I really enjoyed Part 2. Although some parts involving eating and animals made me never want to eat meat again, I found it very intriguing. I couldn't stop reading it. Martel, the author, has a great way of making something that would seems so boring like being shipwrecked very interesting. Part 2 made me question what I would have done if I were in a situation similar to Pi (very unlikely). I'm partial to the ending. In some ways, it seems like something I would do; however, overall the ending really upset me. Anyway I would recommend this book. It was very interesting, and after you finish the novel, it stays in your mind for a while. Oh just to all those out there who liked the book...there is a movie coming out in 2006!!"
2,"Interesting Premise, But...","I really wanted to like this book because the idea is really a great one, but the plot is frustrating. It starts out a little slowly -- the first 50 pages or so. Little did I know that it's actually the best part because once the plot really gets going, it goes nowhere fast. If you're looking for a compelling shipwreck story...this isn't it. If you're looking for an inspiring, faith-building story...this isn't it either. It's somewhat of a disappointment all the way around."
1,Not for me,Not worth the effort. I don't understand the hype. Poorly written and hard to follow. Sorry book club. I just didn't get it
4,None,Great story/teller. Loved the humor and writing style. Engaging characters! Disappointed that so many spiritual issues are brought up and go unanswered
2,Not on my book list,The book was an extremely long wordy description of what seems a totally unrealistic story.I would not recommend this to anyone as it a rambling discourse.
2,Grisley but thought provoking,"Interesting thoughts on animals in captivity. Way too Grisley for me, I don't like having those bloody images in my head. The ending was a little strange, not a satisfying one. The story about his mother and the cook was just as disturbing as the rest of the book about the animals, I don't care which was the real one, they were both awful.,"
2,WHHHATT?,"What is the point of this story? Got tedious and there was only one or two times that the story became interesting. I can see why James Cameron likes this one - usual pablum. I'm going to skip the movie, too."
2,Boring. Can't wait to see the movie,Slow and rambling. The movie trailer looks beautiful and will see movie next week. Would not recommend book to anyone.
3,Reading,Required reading for my son's college course. He is an avid reader so I'm sure he liked the book. Thanks
3,Great start,"I loved this book at first. I enjoyed reading all the trials and problems that were encountered. It started to get weird, then, for me, nasty, and finally, so disappointing. The only sensible ending made me so sad, I did not want to even think about it. It made the story so pointless, please, let's have some fantasy."
4,Great book but . . .,"If you can make it to chapter 37, it starts to get really good. The ending is EXCELLENT. Up until chapter 37, you really have to skip ALOT. Once they get in the liferaft, it gets much better. Still have to skip some of the descriptions as it goes on for pages, but I'm really glad I read it before seeing the movie"
1,The Life of Pi - Disappointing.,"Disappointing. Most of the other reviewers who characterize it in one-star terms, have described it well, in my view. It starts to be a novel about an Indian boy whose family migrates to Canada. He is investigating various religions and his developing adolescent thoughts are fairly engaging. Close the book there, and you will be satisfied. The rest is turgid. You must slog through an allegory where he is marooned in a lifeboat with a tiger being transported to Canada to a zoo. Sound good? OK, well read it then. I thought the whole book was fair, until then. But once that narrative started...well, it went downhill, and fast. I could read no more and discarded it."
1,Wade Pool,"I felt absolutely nothing after reading this book. It didn't make me believe in God. I couldn't have disagreed more with the too lengthy and unpersuasive diatribe about zoos.This book is superficial fodder for people who say they want depth but are unwilling to actually confront it. In fact, it is less.There is far more spiritual philosophy in Stroud's Bartemaeus Trilogy (juvenile fiction!)."
1,Disturbing book,"I only finished Life of Pi because my book club is reading it. I ended it with a strong and surprisingly emotional dislike for the book. It is certainly quite well written with many interesting twists of phrase. However, the primary theme, in my opinion, is a far, far too graphic ""kill or be killed"" one with survival as a sub-theme and religion as just an interesting side-show."
1,appaled,"I'm totally confused as to how so many people could think that this book was worth while reading. I read this book in a book club. I was warned before I started reading that it starts out slow but seems to pick up. Well that certainly wasn't evident. The book started out slow, picked up slightly, and then just slowed right back down again. I found that I was not alone with my opinion when others that read the book said that they found it horrid and hard to finish. Even the leader of the book club did not finish it, I still don't know if he has, and this was 4 months ago! The philisophical aspects of this book are not nearly as powerful as the power to put the reader to sleep."
5,Life of Pi by Yann Martel,"I loved it! The writing is beautiful and the story is captivating. I can't wait to see the movie. Even if you're like me and don't always get the deeper meaning to great literature, you'll still love this book."
5,"A book of spirt, mind, and heart","The life of pie is a great story that will have you enthralled for hours as you dive into this heart warming story of life, death, and discovering ones self. When I choose to read this book I thought that this book would not live up to the hype that it was getting. Once I got into it though I quickly released that this book was defiantly real, and for anybody wanting a totally new experience in a book, then this is for you. Yann Martels unique way of writing will have you wondering, who is Pi going to meet next, where is he going to end up, is he ever going to make it home. Pi's journey is like being a leaf in the wind, no idea where you are going or when yo will get there, just living to be free in a world of endless possibilities. If your an avid reader I suggest you take the time to read this and even if you don't read then this is the book that should get you started."
5,An Amazing Life of Pi,"This is a very special story. I haven't even finished the book yet, but so far, 90% read, I would recommend it to everyone. Yann Martel certainly knows how to tell a story and keep your interest to the point that you can't put the book down."
5,Life of Pi,"I avoided this book for a long time. Just didn't think it would be my thing. When I read the reviews and I was surprised at how many there were, I decided to take a chance. This was a great book and a quick read. I couldn't put it down. Try it!"
1,"No riptides, just rip-off","I am growing tired of so-called ""modern literature,"" and I'm about ready to go back to reading only fast, cheap thrillers. Modern authors seem to fall into two catagories: 1)those using writing as a means to their own catharsis, forcing us to read about the bad things that happened to them during their wretched upbringing; and 2)those whose creativity is so weak that they dream up some bizaar tale for critics to ooh and ahh over, which really amounts to nothing more than gore with which to shock the reader. Yann Martel has done this with ""Life of Pi."" He's done nothing more than write down his hashish-induced hallucinations as if they were the magical journey to an insightful vision. Only of money, I say--and I'm sorry he got mine."
2,Don't believe the hype,"I am an avid reader and when I read the reviews of this book I decided to try it. Let me just say. BORING BORING BORING. The first 100 pages were so bland and way too descriptive of things that were not even vital to the story line. Pages 100-200 were ok. There was a good deal of action and interesting description of surviving the ocean. The last 100 pages, again boring. All in all, if you want to read this book, skip the first 100 and last 100 pages and you may enjoy it."
1,Over-hyped,I read this book based on reviews and word of mouth. Never was there a book more overhyped! A nice story I suppose..but incredibly long and boring. Not worth the hype.
3,A major factual error that detroys my enjoyment,"A muslim cleric will never have the name of Satish Kumar. This error which will not be noticed but anyone but an Indian, kept me from enjoying this book. All seemed a lie thereafter. Didn't he ask someone from India check the book for him before publishing?"
2,a real drag and let-down at the end,"My wife recommended this book to me, and I kept asking her as I got bored with it ""Does it get better?"" I was terribly disappointed in the ending. Not worth my time."
5,Loved the Book and movie,"This is for a granddaughter as a gift. I was supposed to take her to the movie but she got sick just before, so we missed it. Know she will love it"
4,Life of Pi,Very dry at the beginning but then turned into and exciting book. If you can make it through first 100 pages it gets better.
4,Interesting Storyline,"A boy and an adult Bengal tiger in a life boat together floating through the Pacific Ocean. Seems unbelievable? It is. I was not expecting such a strong religious theme. It was a good book though, worth a read for sure."
1,In search of lost time,"I am in search of the time that I lost reading this overrated novel. It was juvenile, puerile, and shallow.BUT, it has one redeeming feature: by reading, and thereby suffering through this awful bore, you can REALLY appreciate great literature!! This book only challenges you to finish it, much as dinner at a bad restaurant tempts you to leave, or eat the bad food."
2,Boring,"""Life of Pi"" had its moments but overall I thought it was very boring. It just moved too slow and I couldn't wait to be done with it."
2,Really too much detail about fictiious events and philosophy,"This was a really a pedantic book...too much philosophy and really tedious...with all its make believe detail...ughI would not recommend this bookit was written as non-fiction, but was bad fiction on and on and on"
2,Anticipation climaxed to a frown,"This is by far, not the worst book I've read but it does not deserve higher than a rate of mediocre. Life of Pi is on the best seller's list, with raving reviews so I was indeed tempted to read. I'm quite disappointed, maybe I started with expecting too much. I finished the book last week, but started about 6 months ago. This is to demonstrate the motivation I had towards the story. I just wanted to finish it and get it off my night table.I can call it a fairy tale story for grown-ups I suppose. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"I really don't understand why this book is so popular. First of all, there was nothing interesting about the style of this book, and to me I think this is important. Secondly, parts were extrememly hard to believe. I dealt with it though, because the beginning of the novel said it was a true story. So I treated it as one. I even told countless things from this book to people thinking that it was true. And maybe it was, but at the end of the novel, suddenly you find yourself unsure. I felt cheated. Overall, I thought this book was boring and disappointing. Pick up a different best seller."
2,What was all the fuss about?,"Having read the book, I have no idea why so many people rave over it. It is not bad as such, I just don't think it stands out. In fact it is really quite tedious at times.I will however say that the very end of the story did get me thinking about what I had been reading - but only out of curiosity as to what happened."
2,What did I miss?,"After all the hype I decided this would be a book I would really get into. I wasn't that interested in the search through the religions or life in India. The reading was ponderous, but I pushed. After putting the book down for a month I went after it again with a renewed commitment to find out what everybody was seeing in it. So I finished it. Life in a life raft with a tiger--big deal. Plot? Where? I still don't get it. I've read a lot of books and I don't have enough time for all the ones I want to read. That was time I can't get back. I'd have to put ""Pi"" pretty low on my list."
1,What's the big deal with this book?,"I read this book while on a 15 hour flight, and it is only because I was trapped in an airplane that I actually finished it.. The beginning of the book is in no way connected to the middle, and it has no ending. The airplane's emergency exits card in the seat pocket was more informative and entertaining."
2,An over-patronizing book,"This is the reason why Indians wouldn't like this book, and why it couldn't be told by ""real Piscine"" the way it was: It is written in an over-patronizing way. It is an attitude that Indians very much dislike. Life of Pi is roughly a nice tale but it would be much more nice if Martel just backed off the stage. To me, Martel is not a talented writer but a boring philosopher with a bad attitude to readers. The book is therefore quite an opposite of what the author proclaims it to be. It would not convince you of the existence of god(s) but may make you turn away from religion(s) which Martel so eagerly tries to advocate."
3,Opportunity missed,"Some wonderful passages (esp when Pi goes blind...) but overall disappointing. Its pretensions to depth seem stilted and the authors voice is irritating. This is a ""message"" book, of which there are pitifully few these days: its trying to tell you something....but the message itself turns out to be slightly shallow. Frustrating. Nice tiger, though."
1,Meaningless and Pretentious,Pretentious parady of what a spiritual treatise should be. Anyone who walks away from this 'work' by renouncing atheism probably was looking for an easy excuse and a fanciful way out. To make a bad premise (and analogy) worse the story goes on in detail about some pretty boring stuff (especially lots of metaphor relating christianity and fishing). If you are a fan of bland pretentious post-modern crap then this is the book for you.
1,I want my money back.,I wasted my time reading this. It has no value to me at all.It's not even worth rating. I would give this a null rating except amazon requires it. Don't waste your time or money on this. You have been warned.
1,Prize Winner? What? Why?? How???,"Sorry, but all the attention and praise escape me. This book is ridiculous. As I read I kept asking, ""What is the point here?"", and still don't know. The writing and ""plot"" seem insincere, as if solely crafted to sell.This book is to literature what Taylor Swift is to music."
2,Well intentioned and overhyped,"It is a well written book with a interesting storyline and potentially a great literature. When reading, please remember it is all fictional, facts mentioned towards nature and animals can be fictional too. I know for a fact that some of the scientific findings that Mr. Martel shared holds no grounds. That is probably why the greatest fictional writers always gone to extent and make sure facts were correct before even starting to write a book.In all, a good book for lesisure reading when waiting for a bus and I would prefer to read books by writers that are purist in their artistry."
4,Entertaining,"This book was recommended by a friend as a ""Guy's Book"", even though my friend is a female and she absolutely enjoyed it. I especially enjoyed the bit about the sloth. Well done."
5,A wonderful and engaging story of survival and faith,"Martel conveys a wonderful entertaining story of Pi Patel who survives out at sea for over 270 days when the cargo ship his family, their zoo animals and him sinks in the Pacific. Pi Patel practices Christianity, Hindu and Islamic religious practices and the story becomes a curious walk through faith and how Pi uses combines three major religions in pursuit of god.The first part of the book covers Pi's life in his father's zoo and how he came to adopt first Christianity and the Islam. The majority of the book though recounts Pi's survival on a lifeboat with a 450-lb Bengal tiger, a zebra, hyena and orangutan. Pi's journey and struggle with the animals on his boat is masterfully told and will keep the reader enthralled.I found this an excellent book both as a story and a unique view on religion and god."
3,The Life of Pi,"This is a book which has the potential to be great -- except it is fraught with gore. It is a fascinating story about a young boy/man (Pi) who is searching for God, for truth, for comfort, for acceptance. He and his family begin a journey from India to Canada. Pi's father owned a zoo, so when the family readied to take this long trip, the animals boarded the ship as well. Pi survives the ocean for 227 days, with many ""mini adventures"". Yann Martel is an excellent writer whose look at religion from many vantage points, knowledge of animal behavior, and study of human behavior is interesting, and sometimes entertaining. Although extremely well-written, the needless massacre of animals, with clear details (with no apparent reason), takes the fascination away for me."
4,a nice epic spiritual quest,I enjoyed this story. It is similar in my mind to books like the Alchemist.
4,Life of Pi,"Throughly enjoyed the book, especially the beginning and the ending. A variety of topics covered to make you think. Recommend."
2,"Well written, upsetting material","This book is very well written and Yann Martel proves himself to be an illustrative writer. Towards the middle of the book, however, I was getting a little bored and the description was too monotonous. I read the rest of the book by reading the first few sentences of paragraphs until the end, when the whole story came together. Overall, it was a very gruesome tale and, towards the end when I was really engrossed, very upsetting. I wouldn't consider myself overly sensitive, and this book just upset me with all the details of killing and bloodshed."
5,Well...,"This used to be my favorite book. It's still in the running, no doubt. Still, Some of the tiny details could have been worked out better, maybe some emotions explained more deeply. Of course, that's why I feel this book is so well written. It's quite human. We often can't describe our emotions nor the actions based upon our confused feelings.Looking for a thought-provoking (but never brain-numbing) light read? This could be the book for you. I couldn't put this one down, even skipped a few meals for it-- I never do that."
1,the most overrated book of 2003,"The Life of Pi may well be the most prominent victim of book hype 2003. Artistically unremarkable dribble about religion and spirituality ends inconclusively and is followed by a pointless survival story. Filled with irrelevant and oftentimes misleading or plainly false comments about zoolifeand biology in general, it seems that some reviewer got carried away by latest wave of ""ethnic"" authors. Fortunately, lack of talent brings with it a soothing brevity and lack of detail that shortens the ordeal of reading."
2,"Ludicrous and ""out to sea""","Perhaps I'm not as ""deep"" as some others who have read this book and experienced a life changing religious epiphany, since I found this story to be quite ludicrous. The writing style was pretty good but I found the plot line to be severely lacking. At times the main character, Pi, speaks like the young person that he is however at other times I got the feeling that Pi had been possessed by the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi, save for the fact that Gandhi preached non-violence and this book is full of violent acts of the nastiest kind. If you want to read a genuinely fine and philosophical sea story I strongly suggest Ernest Hemmingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"", however if you have a couple months of free time then work your way through ""Life of Pi."" I bet this book is quite popular in prisons for killing time while serving out long term sentences."
2,Disappointing,"I was quite excited to read this, but despite a great introduction, I found the book mediocre and, frankly, pretty gross. Don't read this if you have a sensitive stomach--the descriptions of zebra's being eaten alive from the inside out and the deliciousness of turtle blood is a bit much to take. It just never had the payoff I expected. A very disappointing book."
5,"So vivid, I was convinced this was an autobiography",Beautifully written. A real testatment to the human spirit and certainly the best book I've read in a long time.
2,"Shocked, But Not Awed","At its base this is an extraordinary story of how a boy and a Bengal tiger survived at sea, alone for seven months. But however courageous and persevering the protagonists, the tale is gruesome. The tiger and boy survive, but the carnage is rampant. Far from ""making one believe in God"" (per dust jacket), it is more likely you will experience the fear of God. This is a tale of survival--grim, brutal, and violent. The violence is overwhelming; so much so that I came to the point where I dreaded to turn the page, not knowing what violent wrenching carnage would occur next.I respect the fact that survival in these circumstances is brutal. But the story is told with little compassion and is almost bestial in nature. It is man at his lowest ebb, man as beast, man devoid of God. The idea and plot line are exceptional, but the execution is cold, violent, and base."
4,Amazing,"I read this book in about a week. I found real good and amazing. If you wanna read about strength, will and beliefs you will find it here. Thank you for the story!"
4,worth reading,This book gets a little far fetched at times. If Yann was trying to send a message about religion I missed it. None the less it is a fun read.
4,Life of Pi,Loved Yann Martel writing style and keen imagination.Some of his graphic descriptions were too upsettingfor a weak stomach
4,Interesting,"I am not sure if this book is a real life story, or it is fiction. It is an amazing story, one filled with facts that make it seem a true experience. The only thing that makes me wonder is is floating island as it doesn't seem real."
5,now a movie,"What a wonderful book. The plot is fantastic, the writing is delicious, And the end is a question--which story do you believe? By the way, the movie is true to the book."
5,One of my favorites...,"Life of Pi - my second reading - this is one of my favorite books of all time! Pi is such a likable hero and the book is brilliantly written! I would definitely recommend this book. I have not seen the movie yet, but the book has so much depth to it that I know a movie 10 hours long could not capture the intensity of the book."
5,"""Good Book Depression"" has just set in.","Life of Pi was a wonderful ride where the reader is taken on a visual vacation like no other.While the story has a few lulls in it, most of the tale is enthralling. This is the kind of book when it's over you can easily slip into a ""Good Book Depression""."
5,How could I have missed this book?,"When I saw the TV ad which flashed on the screen rather quickly, I thought it was about ""The History of Pi"" by Petr Beckmann. I then looked at the Amazon holdings and realized my mistake which turned out to be a perfectly delightful mistake.The book produced a range of emotions from a hilarious interpretation of ""hedging one's bet"" on who's God could produce the best results all the way to a few tears as Pi realized his plight. But then, his courage was probably goaded into a resolve to take life one miserable day at a time, realizing that had Pi been adrift alone on the boat he might not have survived. Thus the semi-religious conclusion: God (no matter which one you choose to believe) is going to work His mysterious ways whether you like them or not. Stand back and watch!The book was a delightful and thought-providing romp into one young person's triumph over more challenges than he hoped ever to encounter.Al StrohleinSan Diego"
3,"A fairly slow go, but the end makes it worth your while.","As a former English major and current busy person I was interested in this Booker Prize winning title, but (okay, I'll confess) I found the book slow. So many times I wanted to quit as I found parts simply meandering, but part of me pressed on, and the end makes it worth-the-while. In the end, the book fulfills its promises. Read it, yes, but don't be alarmed if you don't exactly find it to be a page turner for the middle 200+ pages."
5,Test of Faith,"Life of Pi takes the reader on a voyage where faith is truly tested. It's all about how hard we will work to achieve an end result which is truly valuable to us. In this case, life and the desire to live takes on new meaning. Arriving at the conclusion as to whether the subject form of our test,is really our savior or opponent is the bigger question each reader will have to answer, after completing this capitivating piece of literature.Very well written. Five stars for making it so difficult to close this book."
2,Stupid Story,"I found this tale to be an interesting and believable tale, up to about 3/4th of the way thru the book. Then it became unbelievable, and quite frankly, stupid. The ending was particularly poor."
1,Flawed Sermon,"While Pi's philosophical discourse begins innocently enough, he suddenly starts blathering such nonsense about agnostics that I could not take him seriously after that. For example, he says that he does not like agnostics because the core of their belief system is ""doubt"". While this view might pander to some religious readers, or even to those who expect to find God somehow in this novel, it is manifestly wrong. How could such an enlightened person as Pi hold such an erroneous, oversimplified view of agnosticism? For me, this gross inconsistency in his belief system recast him in the role of a seriously disillusioned young man. In the vague hope that the remainder of the novel would somehow redeem his character, I finished it. Needless to say, I was disappointed. I hope that others who read this book and find God do not as easily find themselves with a false bias against agnosticism."
1,I did not like this book. I thought it was a waste of time.,"I thought this book was a waste of time when I read it. If you look at the author's past you'll see that he's from Spain and he studied a lot of philosophy. My theory on this book was that the author wanted to use his philosophic expertise in order to write an amazing book with a lot of themes and motifs. I got the whole nature, animal to human comparison or allegory. I think the author tried too hard by fluffing up his book with nonsense. It would have been a better story if he had made the story shorter, and more how do I say this, um... interesting and enjoyable I guess.All and all it was not a good book. I'm an AP English and U.S. History student, and i've read amazing books that use philosophy, and a lot of themes and metaphors. All I can tell you is that this book is no where close to the many accomplished works I have read.I think that is book is not worth your time,and you're better off reading anything else,Loran"
1,A book for our time. Unfortunately.,"It is disappointing how this book has become the darling of thebook clubs. Unbelievable, poorly researched (if you care aboutreality), ridiculous even, it certainly isn't a realisticnovel. If it is an allegory, try reading Bunyan's Pilgrim'sProgress instead. In fact, my recommendation is to read anyclassic instead. The only book that I have seen lately thatis worse is another club favorite, ""Middlesex""."
2,"A Good Weekend Read, But Not Booker Material","After winning the Booker prize this year, this book has been generating lots of press here, and in Mongolia. While I enjoyed chapter 3, the rest of the chapters were not of the quality I've come to expect from good ole' Yam.The story begins in a kind of space age Noah's Ark, with a zany host of characters from across the galaxy. After nearly being destroyed by an asteroid, the Ark crashes on a nearby planet. The rest of the story follows a family of Zarks and a family of Bopahs, as they try to survive on the formidable ice world they crashed on. In the end, the story is about redemption, as the youngest Zark learns to love young Christoph Popah.I spent a weekend reading the book, and while I was entertained, it certainly wasn't what I expected from a Booker prize winner. Better luck next time Yam."
2,The unbeliavable... Life of Pi,"This book is a hard to believe novel. It is not quite a thriller. It does not make you want to keep reading. It is quite dull. I am glad I read this book though. It is one of those books you couldve went without reading but glad that you did.It tells you about the Hindu, Muslim and Christian religion. it also tells you a lot about survival. I wouldnt recomment it for a free read but it should certanly be read."
3,Wasn't happy,"At first I enjoyed the book. The middle I did not, it dragged on too long. The end was disappointing to me."
4,purchased for someone else,"I ordered this book for my neice, it was one of the books she was required to read during the summer...She said she liked it."
5,Great Read,"Wonderful story for a person of any religon, any belief system. A boy who's family owns a zoo in India decides to move the zoo to Canada. The boat sinks en route and the only survivors are Pi and a couple of animals from the zoo. The story takes you through Pi's terrible ordeal being adrift at sea for a ridiculous amount of time and how he co-exists with the animals and specifically one of the most deadly animals known to mankind. You get to go deep inside of Pi's brain as he figures out how to make it. A must read for anyone."
3,Liked the other half,"Funny, I most enjoyed the begining of the book of Pi's life in India and the zoo. The rest of the book began to drag for me after a while. If the author was trying to show how boring being lost at sea is by boring the reader, it worked. Surprisingly, I wished the story had continued more afterwards, I would liked the story to continue in Canada."
4,Deserves a Second Read,"On first read The Life of Pi is a charming, engaging story. The story of his childhood and early explorations of the universe neatly frame his later adventures. As his story evolves however, and I learned more about him and his companion Richard Parker, it became increasingly clear that I would need to reread the book, and hear Pi's tale again in the light of what I'd learned to fully appreciate it.I think it says something about the story that I'm very much looking forward to doing so, and expect that I will have an even more satisfying read the second time through"
3,My Review On Life Of Pi,"I had to read Life of Pi for my English class. I thought the book was kind of depressing and some parts of the book were way too detailed. The parts that were especially way too detailed were the killings of the animals, mentioning of urine one too many times, and Pi's telling of the story without the animals. I kind of liked the book before the sinking of the Tsimtsum occurred, but after the sinking it just got too depressing and disgusting."
4,Very...Interesting,"Yann Martel is an excellent writer who writes Pi Patel so well that I feel as though I know him personally. The troubled times Pi goes through during his fight for survival is touching. I was rooting for him all the way until the end. Although I was a little upset by the ending, it just made me think of how Yann Martel is using his story as an allegory to our world today. There is a side that most people choose to see that although it is not a fairytale world it is nice and the end turns out to be ok. But there is the uglier, more true side that some people refuse to see. Although in Pi's first story it is not perfect or easy by any means, it is better and easier to deal with than what happens in the second side of the story."
3,interesting,"i liked this book very much, although i think it's a very young book. the writer, being young, starts out to impart some great truth, and ends up instead with an enchanting contradiction to everything he thinks he's saying: i.e., he stumbles on a greater truth. or a better story, as he puts it. in spite of its claims, the book will not make you believe in god, unless you already do, but it will certainly make you believe in tigers, flying fish and carnivorous algae, which are much more interesting."
1,Just couldn't get through it,"I had read other books that are cross referenced with this one as ""If You Like This Book, Try..."" but I could never get into this story. After 50 pages I gave up."
2,Am I the only one that doesn't like it?,"My english teacher recommended we read this book. I wish I hadn't. I mean, it's an ok book and it does give you faith and all that stuff, but at the same time it's not very believable. It gets monotonous after awhile. My primary reason for not liking it was all the brutality in it. I am too sensitive about animals. This book made me cry! All in all, I couldn't bring myself to believe in any of it, and I skimmed through a large portion of the book since alot of it deals with animals slaughtering each other or Pi slaughtering animals. Nevertheless, this book did make me question what I'd do in that situation. I think I'd survive like 2 days out in the ocean. And I'm pretty sure I won't be stuck in a lifeboat with a tiger, hyena, zebra, AND orangutan any time soon, so I won't worry about that."
3,Nothing special,"Like many others I read this at the recommendation of a friend. It was a struggle to read, bringing to mind the horror of having to read Old Man and the Sea back in high school. I don't argue that the book is unimaginative, it's just that NONE of the ideas struck me as new. It's an awfully long book to ultimately be so unoriginal."
3,Okay,"A decent story, but not terribly innovative or original. Certainly not deserving of any major prizes or all the hype and adulation it has received, but worth reading for entertainment. And no, it will not change your life or make you find God. Like it was that easy."
3,A Bit Forgettable,"I was definately looking forward to this one. Booker Prize! Canadian writer! Lots of gushy quotes!Well, I may have missed something, but while I felt the first half was wonderful and warm and surprising, and the rest of the book had its moments, I just couln't stay particularly excited about a book that turned into a how-to manual on surviving in a life boat with a tiger for 277 days. Or perhaps I could have taken this for 50 pages or so, but not 150. It really reminded me of a bunch of children's books I read back in the day: Swallows and Amazons, and Swiss Family Robinson and so on, only with less of a point, or a least less of an entertaining pay off.Although I will say that the algae island was very good. And I did like Pi's name."
3,Not Recommended for Cynical or Critical Thinkers,"I opened this book with no preconceptions but quickly realised that while it has enough spiritual mumbo jumbo to appeal to many readers, but it was not to my taste. I found the pace of the story laboured and its themes poorly connected. I felt neither understanding nor empathy towards Pi, probably because there is little reflection of his own character in the descriptions of his companions and surroundings. The central section of the story aboard the lifeboat kept me sufficiently interested to press on, but in hindsight I felt let down. A few nice ideas here, but they are not explored nearly as well as they might be. In which case why not read a true account of survival, rather than this fantasy/fiction masquerading as fact?"
4,Good read,"Well written, good story. Well written story. It will have readers searching to see if the story is at all factual."
4,Enjoyable read!,This is the first novel I have enjoyed in a long time. It drew me into the adventure and is a unique storyline.
4,Long read,I would not recommend this book to younger children. Too hard to read and it would be confusing. The story is thought provoking and it does make you think you are out in the ocean alone.
3,I'm Now Sure,"It was ambiguous in many areas, but I feel the author wrote it that way to provoke discussion. Was his intention to present metaphors of life or was his intention to describe the condition on face value. The author leaves this question open for the interpretation of the reader. Were there really wild animals or were there people who radiate the characteristics of wild animalsUltimately I believe the whole purpose of the book was to reinforce that life emanates from a supreme Creator, who decides the destinies of all life. There is no chance, no coincidence; no accidents; no happenstance … we all move through a preordained cycle from birth to death at the pleasure of the Creator."
1,MARTEL IS A PLAGIARIZER!!!,"A lot of people aren't aware that Yann Martel stole the main idea for this book from Brazilian author Moacir Scliar, who back in 1981 wrote a fictional account of a Jewish boy escaping Nazi Germany in a ship with circus animals who ends up in a a raft with a jaguar. the book is called ""Max e os Felinos"" (Max and the Felines) and Scliar was too much of a gentleman to ever accept the insistent offers from countless lawyers who wanted to sue Martel over this. When confronted, Martel has admitted he used Scliar's oeuvre as inspiration, but like the good storyteller he is, came up with a rationale for why he doesn't think he plagiarized the Brazilian. As good as the book may be, you should ask yourself if you want to support this kind of unethical shenanigans before you buy it.http://www.amazon.com/Max-Cats-Moacyr-Scliar/dp/0452284538/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1361327178&sr;=8-1&keywords;=max+and+the+cats"
5,Charming and Intelligent,"Yann Martel has created one of the most likeable characters in recent days- Pi is intelligent, charming, and amazingly captivating. With small glimmers of ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" Martel develops the ocean into an unforgiving, vast, and mysterious character. But perhaps the crux of the book occurs at the end, when Martel forces the reader to question the events and stories, and their ultimate meaning, that occur in the book. An absolute must read. We hope Marel can top it off."
4,Great storytelling,Very entertaining and at times a real pageturner.Also a good story about a culture very different from my World.
4,Pi review,An engaging read that is both entertaining and thought provoking.A simplistic story with hidden messages - less is more!
5,Brilliant!,"I could not put this book down. Pi's story is absolutely compelling and written in a rich, easy style that made it an absolute pleasure to read."
2,loose and disappointing,"The power of the Booker Prize to promote mediocre works is impressive. This novel is sometimes amusing, but often careless and self-indulgent with loose writing. It's a fantasy with one character and that character not deeply known. It's pretensions of religious insight are more flashy than wise, and too often the author seems to be straining to keep the story going with pointless invention. This is far from the best among current novels."
2,So what?,"Maybe I am thick, but this book certainly did not make me believe in God. Nor did it engage me enough to take another read to try and figure it out. For me, if a book needs a lot of figuring out, it better be a good read. I liked the way that the author slowly layered information about the adult Pi with the young Pi's history. Once he was adrift, tho, I was lulled by the rocking of the lifeboat and searched for a story that was either there or not. When I was done, I just didn't care anymore.All said, I must applaud the copy on the jacket which got me to pick up the book. That was as compelling it got."
2,No pie in the Life of Pi,"I loved the conceit of the plot: boy and tiger in life boat. As a well-illustrated childrens' book---perhaps with pop-up pages---it would have worked. But by page 200, the Life of Pi sinks, along with the reader's expectation of epiphany, of hoping to discover one lasting moment or lesson.Mark this: those who tout this book as a paean to spiritual awakening and endurance are wrong. What happens here is the boy survives. It happens to people and is often heoric. That Pi has has to surive under such contrived circumstances is survival caricature. It is embarrassing and suggests an artist inability to write about the tough and magnificant human spirit. We learn nothing from this book, carry away no experience, look for and find no parable in the story that illuminates.The book jacket suggests that the Life of Pi may ""make you believe in God."" Perhaps good writing can do just that, for a minute or forever. Certainly, there is no glimpse of the divine in the Life of Pi."
1,gore and more gore,"I was so disappointed in this book. After reading so many positive reviews, I ran right out and purchased it. It was one of the few books I forced myself to finish as I kept telling myself there had to some redeeming quality. After reading about a goat being given in sacrifice to a large predator to teach children a lesson, a zebra with a broken leg being eaten alive from the inside out and a detailed description of collecting and eating tiger feces by Pi, thie book left me COLD!!"
5,Book Club Pick,We had a great book discussion on this book at our Book Club. All of us liked the book. A few people said it was hard to get into at first.
4,Good book,"I thought the book was well written. The only reason I didn't rate it five stars was because I thought there was more gorey stuff that what was needed to explain the deaths of the animals. Otherwise, the writer kept my attention; There were a few evenings I couldn't put the book down."
5,"Great begining, great story, great ending","Keeps you interested, teaches you lessons, make you think, and all of this in an endearing story of a young boy who looses his parents while in a storm (while they were in a ship on their way from India to Canada), and is left alone at sea with......Read it! It's great. If you liked The Alchemist, you'll love this."
5,This will go down as one of my FAVORITE books!,I didn't even know this book was around until I started seeing previews for the upcoming movie. I downloaded it to my Kindle and began reading immediately. This book was very well written with so much detail and color that it wasn't hard to imagine all of the sceens. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
4,Good book,"The book was a good read and an interresteing story, leaving the reader question the power of the human mind."
3,Slow starter,"A little different than I expected. Slow to start, but it does pick up. Tried to read before movie and now I am ready to see it."
2,Disappointing,"This book took a long time to go nowhere. If you like reading fanciful prose about an imagined adventure killing and consuming a whole array of living beings, this is for you. I could do without."
5,funny,"I thought this story was sad, funny and inspiering. I'm not sure I want to see the movie.. Because I always expect the movie to be the same as the book. The ending of the book had me laughing."
2,Not impressed,"While my friends raved about this book, I was not impressed. The first section of the book describing Pi's life before the shipwreck was well written and interesting, especailly Pi's search for God. However, I found the description of Pi's existence on the life boat to be boring and tedious. I admit I skipped several paragraphs and at times complete pages.The parts that were interesting were violent. I was disgusted by the author's excrutiating detail of how the zebra suffered before dying. The deaths of the other animals were equally brutal, and I found the cannabilism offensive. The alternative ending was certainly intriguing and creative, but I still read the last page of this novel with a sigh of relief that it was finally over.Having said this, I must admit that I appear to be the only person who feels this way. Several of my friends have read the book and loved it, as did the critics and reader reviewers at Amazon."
3,Clever story and intelligently written,"Life of Pi moves slowly at first, but hang in there. The unfolding story is fascinating but in my opinion did not prove it's point ,that there is a God. Yann Martel's writings on fear, indecision and religion are spectacular but the story was too vague, perhaps intentionally, to prove it's point. Great selection for a book club to debate the veracity of each version/ending.Would highly recommend readers to read an original tale, Max and the Cats by Moacyr Sciliar written in 1981, for a highly entertaining, insightful and focused story in the same vein. I would have given Life of Pi 4 stars until I read that story."
2,Long . . . . . .,"The premise is interesting -- a man and a tiger aboard a small lifeboat. The novel, however, gets very tedious. And the end with the insurance adjusters (who come across as Laurel & Hardy) was unbelievable. The book was entertaining at times, but not worth finishing."
5,Every read is better than the last,"There are so many good books to read in the world, I rarely read one twice. I have read my paperback edition of Life of Pi three times now and I can't wait to get my hands on the illustrated version! I will have to make it a fourth read as soon as I receive it. Each time I read it, I find something new...a new idea, a new hint, a new question... If you are headed on a vacation for spring or summer break, make sure this book is in your carry-on!"
5,It may change your life,"The first 90 something pages are confusing and tedious, yet the words that follow engaged me for the entire voyage. I especially like the twist at the end that indelibly changes one's view of the world, and of a story."
4,"Ignore the hype, go in with low expectations and enjoy...","LIFE OF PI is a much talked about (i.e. hyped) book about a boy who is lost at sea with a Bengal Tiger. The blurbs on the book jacket are all over the board- ""A story that will make you believe in God"" and ""Think an adult Calvin and Hobbs"" etc. Ignore the rehtoric and praise and what you have her is a really good adventure story with a lot of heart. THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA without as much depth or significance. Sure, the begining is a bit tedious (though not unreadable as some reviewers here have stated) and the overall religious aspect feels a bit underdeveloped by the end...LIFE OF PI is still worthy of your time. The ending is excellent and leaves you wanting more. And at the end of the day, isn't that what makes a book good? Ignore the hype, read the book."
3,Shipwrecked with strange companions,"It takes forever to get to the meat of the story.There is a lot of boring stuff about wild versus animals in captivity,and bunches of boring stuff about religion.I would'nt recommend it to anyone"
2,the movie trailerr gave me a flaase sense of what the book was like,"I personally have found this book hard to get into and in fact gave up after about 35% as it was just about animals- lots of facts and points of interest- but boring, then a whole lot about religions- again facts and points of interest but again boring.... I have heard others rave about the book and then about the movie but frankly I did not see it. If I wanted to learn about animals and religion I would research it and not expect to read about it in a ""novel"""
2,Disconnected story,Is it a dream ? Plausible or pure unreal fiction ? A survival story that leaves to be desired at the end. After reading the book I decided not to go watch the movie.
3,...meh,"I was really looking forward to reading this novel; totally my genre, great reviews, etc. but, this happens to be one of those cases where the book doesn't match up to the hype. I am a complete sucker for survival novel, I just felt this one lacked a climax, or detail. It's alright if a novel doesn't have a peak, but in that case it should make me feel like I'm living every day with the character, which it didn't. It also didn't make me believe in God, as the first chapter promised. However, I am very glad that a fellow Canadian has received such recognition."
5,"It's the very definition of a ""page-turner"".","Think ""Robinson Crusoe"" with a lifeboat for an island, solar stills for livestock, and a 450-pound Friday with fangs, and, oh, Daniel Defoe would be proud! There is next to nothing wrong with this book. Yann Martel takes us on a suspenseful and philisophical journey of the human spirit through the eyes of an adolescent Indian castaway who is one of the most masterfully developed characters in this reader's recent memory. To go on would be a crime against the work's future audience. That means you. Brush up on your nautical terms and then go get lost in it."
4,Exceptional,Very thought provoking right up to the end. I just finished It but think I will read it twice. Excellent.
4,excellent,"written so that I felt I was there,,could picture everything in my head...couldn't wait to be able to pick it up again and read it,,"
4,An intriguing story,"I had to read it again as I had said to my daughter that ""there is a book they won't be making into a movie"" and lo and behold they did.I enjoyed it more the second time and am looking forward to the movie."
5,Great Book,I couldn't put this book down. I loved it - and couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. In addition to that it is very well written. And what an imagination this fellow has.
4,Not as good as I hoped.,"Good novel but after reading the critics the book was a bit diappointing. I would give 3,5 stars if it would be possible but it's more 4 than 3."
4,Eval--Life of PI,"Interesting story, clean language, good imagination of the author, some philosophical spin, and clever descriptions and sayings (""reason is the fools gold of the brilliant"") make it a fascinating read. RDR"
4,Leaves you wondering (and wanting to believe),"This book will entertain you endlessly, and then leave you doubting youself and debating your friends. I would give it a 5, but my broken heart won't allow it."
2,Bad!,"I'm not sure what I expected to get from this novel, but it wasn't what I got. Which was nothing! The book moves very slow. There are pages and pages of description for some things and then others there are 2 words. The book is very graphic and confusing at times."
2,What?,"I still haven't decided if I liked the book. It was certainly different. I chose not to see the movie, but I may re-think that at a later date. It sure had some strange happenings in it."
3,"Beautifully written, thoughtful, but not inspiring","I delayed reading Life of Pi because I dislike fantasy and particularly dislike books where animal suffering and death are used for heartstring-pulling and to add cheap emotional depth. I was VERY pleasantly surprised by the amusing, smart writing, the clear-eyed approach to religion, and especially the zoological realism of the animal portrayal. I also admired the realistic description of both physical and psychic pain during the long tribulations. In the end, I thought it was indeed a fantastical adventure, and was not at all inspired. The sense I got was of an uncaring nature and universe--including insurance agents!--triumphed over by one admirable individual. So, I enjoyed it but it did not really stay with me."
3,Skim to the end,"This book got a little strange before it took it's big turn to the story near the end. It became totally unbelievable, and proved so at the conclusion. It made me feel like I waseted my time believing the emotion and action in the book, as it approached the deliverence of the message at the end. Good message, big waste of alot of time before getting to it."
2,Not my cup of tea,I spent time in the reading of this story hoping in progression only getting a choice in the end of which story to accept. I choose not to accept it at all and it left a poor taste in my mouth. Glad I didn't go see the movie.
3,Meh.,"After hearing about this book for a couple years I finally purchased it and was pretty disappointed. The entire first third of the book seems almost completely unrelated to the rest of the book and I was very bored. Even then I just never connected with the character and although it was somewhat entertaining the only good part for me was the way it ended, but even then I had a sense from about halfway through that it would be something along the lines of what it was. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't good either."
1,huh,"Still trying to figure out how this book relates to the movie everyone is raving about, I am stuck on the first portion of the book, Pi is telling the readers all about life in India. So mundane I couldn't get beyond the second chapter. I could have written a much more action pacted book about my life."
2,Unforvorable,"I never couold get into this book so I never finished it. It wasvery philosophical, so someone who likes that kind of read wouldprobably enjoy it."
3,Lifelong pi,"Very long and drawn out plot line. Could have been shorter. Great ending. Good character development. Classic read, but not worth a re-read."
2,Life ofPi,"i found this book very difficult to get into, at this stage i have only managed to get to chapter six."
3,Life of pi,"I really liked this book, it was very complicated but once I got towards the middle I got the meaning really well. I'm looking forward to the next one.!!!! :-)"
5,Great and sad,Fun and humereadle with a hint of the sadness in the wold to day and a special effect in the end she he was telling his two different story s.
2,Not what the movie trailers imply.,Not what I was expecting. Lost interest and putIt down. May try again. Was looking for the action impliedBy the movie trailers.
3,A Tiger Trap,"Well written and very informative. One learns a lot about zoos and wild animals and then is ambushed by a terrible disaster at sea and an equally disturbing saga of survival. It was a lot more violent and bloody than I anticipated. I understand that the movie version of this book is going to be rated PG or PG-13. If so, they might as well change the title to A boy and His Cat Go Sailing."
2,Interesting Enough to Finish Reading,"I thought this book was boring. I understand the necessity of giving the reader some background on the main character, but this case may have been a little excessive. I kept reading because I thought if Pi reached the water things would pick up. Once in the ocean, the story was only interesting enough that I was able to finish the book.***SPOILER ALERT***I like those Nature programs on PBS and I found the way the author had the animals behave on the lifeboat very interesting.The island that Pi and Richard Parker came upon was also a highlight.The end was a little twisted. Pi gives an alternate version of what happened in his lifeboat. The author may have been trying to be thought provoking, but I ended up being disappointed. I felt like I forced myself to read through the entire book and the story might have actually been made up."
3,Couldn't Finish,"This book had such rave reviews that I had to read it but I was soo bored I couldn't finish it. Maybe I'll give it another shot but while the writer is talented, this book just didn't grab me."
4,Life of Pi- Starts slow and ends with a bang!,"When i started reading this, i didn't think i could get through it. For me, it was boring!! It was too drawn out, very detailed.But, after the family decided to move, i could not put the book down. The details made me feel like i was in another boat watching him. I didn't want it to end and, at the end, it made me mad.I definately highly recommend this book."
5,EXCELLENT! A MUST read!,"I had never read this book, and with the recent movie debut I decided it was time to read it before I saw the movie. I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the writing and the story. The meaning of the story really spurred great conversation with many family and friends who read it. Not all like this story, but I think it is really a beautiful one that cause much self reflection and provides great insight through the voice of a hopeful young man who befriends a Bengal Tiger named, RIchard Parker."
3,Interesting book to waste time in an airport,"The book is certainly something that is far removed from any particular genre. The writing is good, with descriptions which fit the time and place well. The tale itself requires such a complete suspension of reality that one must be in the mood to perform that task adroitly. I won't see the movie!"
3,Great book,Much better than the movie and quite thought provoking; a wonderful book and a must read for almost all ages
3,A Little Disappointing,"I heard this book might give some spiritual uplifting, but i was disappointed.....really just a fantasy. Maybe the movie for the cinematography!"
3,Very earnest attempt,"I was drawn into this well-written narrative, without a doubt. But I expected an epiphany at some point, and instead what I got was unoriginal philosophizing - I was disappointed because the book neither added to or in any way altered my existing philosophy, so I can't say it was worth the effort."
3,Pretty good,Was very entertaining throughout the book however the ending was a bit predictable although still enjoyable. Lots of violence so only for adults.
2,Life of Pi,"I purchased this book because my son mentioned it. I really didn't enjoy it, probably because I don't care for fantasy."
3,A little disappointed,"Interesting premise for a story of life, mixed with spiritually. fFound that it dragged in places. Not up to all the hype, but overall entertaining."
4,Loved it.,Life of Pi. Great read. Inspiring and beautifully written. It opens your eyes to what imagination and determination can bring.
3,Story of courage and spirituality,"First quarter of book sometimes slow but important to setting up remainder of story. Majority of story revealed young Pi's courage, ingenuity and spirituality in the face of many life and death situations. He displayed admirable and intelligent character beyond his years. A good read for teens and adults."
3,Eh...it was just okay,After a while the story got a smidgen redundant...I would have liked it better if there were more about what happened after his rescue.
3,Very slow start but gets better in the middle,Comparative Religious commentary for first fifteen chapters.Settles into boy vs tiger struggle.Continues to impart guru/swami/Sufi take on lifeInterestingly kindle version has previous buyers' highlighting of passages underlined.This is akin to a library book that has pencilled comments or underscoring - not to everyone's liking.
2,To drawn out,This book was so drawn out I lost interest quickly which was a shame as I was looking forward to reading it.
5,Absolutely wonderful,"I can't believe this book has yet to be reviewed here...it is one of the best I've read this year so I assumed this page would be filled with praise.Martel's writing style is relaxed and very enjoyable and the story is simply entertaining. I finished reading this book over two months ago and still find myself thinking about it. It holds your interest, keeps you thinking and then leaves you wondering about it after your done.I burn through a couple dozen books a month and this was one of the most thoroughly enjoyable books I've read in some time!"
4,I love tigers,"Take a trip with Pi over the Pacific ocean. His journey took 277 days, yours through the book will take less than 7. I'm not at all being corny, this book is a really page turner, especially once you get to the second major section. I caught myself with an absent minded fantasy about being shipwrecked. I hope Pi doesn't read this, he wouldn't agree with me!"
3,"Good, but the first quarter of the book is a little wordy","Don't get me wrong, I liked The Life of Pi. The graphic way in which animal deaths were conveyed was a little disturbing, and I felt that it was a little gratuitous. Merely describing the death would have been enough without such detail. I also wanted to throw this book out of the window at times because of the wordiness of the author. I found myself saying out loud ""Alright, I got it. Move on""! I stuck with it, and ended up really enjoying the book. I've read reviews about people having spiritual epiphanies from reading the book. I did not. I saw the spiritual aspect, and it made me think a bit, but it certainly wasn't life altering. I would have given this book 4 stars had it not been so wordy at times and had the animal deaths been a bit less graphic. Definitely worth the read though."
2,Okay but not great,"I find that ""artistic intellectuals"" sometimes develop a fear of offending their peers and develop a group mentality towards mediocre literature. Fortunately I am not an artistic intellectual and can safely say without retribution that this is an okay book - but I have read a lot better! I gained no insight about myself or my world from this book."
3,Kind of entertaining,"The life of Pi is an entertaining read, with beautiful imagery and description. I do not consider it masterful, though. As a parable it has some interesting elements (e.g. Pi being his mind's ring-master), but it spends inordinate amounts of time on detail irrelevant to the message. The final conclusion seems to be that the world is a terrible place and we are justified to make up our gods so we can (a) escape reality, (b) indulge ourselves to embellishment or (c) make it easier to tolerate.Neither are convincing arguments (not that any real arguments are mounted in the book), although I have some sympathy with (c), since our experience reality is subjective."
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,An absolutly amazing book. It made me think alot abouit overcoming tha odds and makes you realize how precious life and family really is.
2,Overhyped.,"This book is somewhat simplistic and shallow. The religious themes praised in many reviews are only tangentially explored. The author spends a lot of time describing superficial aspects of three major religions, and people's surprise about the protagonist's desire to belong to all three, but that's about it. There is very little substance or thought expressed about reconciling differences in thought, or insights about their origins. Real issues are meticulously avoided. I thought the story itself was interesting, but in my humble opinion not deserving of the praise in most of the reviews, and certainly not for the reasons given - that this is a deep exploration of religious thought or human spirituality. I don't mean to disparage the work, which I'm sure many people appreciate, but I wanted to give my 2 cents of balance to the reviews, many of which, I believe, are inflated."
5,"HYPNOTIC, ENGAGING, ENTHRALLING","Quite simply, I could not put this book down. I was obsessed with the next twist of the plot. It's kind of like Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea meets Kingsolver's Prodigal Summer. From beginning to end I completely lost myself in this story. When I started getting close to the end, I slowed my reading so that I could savor every second of it. When it was over, I was sad. This is the best book I've read all year."
5,An element of style..,"In E.B. White's ""Elements of Style"", the great American author praises those few writers who can relay great emotion through the simplest of prose. If Mr. White had been alive to read Yann Martel's ""Life of Pi"", this book would have warmed his heart.The winner of the Booker Prize, ""Life of Pi"" is a story about the innate necessity of survival, the ability to find one's inner-self, and the importance of cooperation and coexistence.Incorporated in succint prose, Mr. Martel relays his story through both straight-foward dialogue as well as many cunning metaphors. He passes his own brand of social agenda as well, and one must read this book with a careful eye in that regard. However, I do not say that to deter any readers from picking up this book.""Life of Pi"" earned its many praisings through excellent writing and an almost philosophical premise. Of any book published in 2002, this is certainly one of the more insightful novels."
4,Story of life,"So much of life is full of fears, decisions and just trying to live. This is a well told story."
3,Promises more than it delivers,"What a marvelous start... but it seems that this novel promises more than it delivers towards the end of the book. However, after the opening which promises to ""make us believe in God"", the very central part of the book seems to be bursting with unecessary details and develops way too slowly - perhaps this is done purposely, but it does lack rhythm. The story wouldn't make me believe in God, but Martel's Pi is indeed a very charming character, and the novel is intelligently concepted."
2,Underwhelming,"I couldn't be more surprised that the Amazon.com editors chose this book to top their 2002 list. Has it been that bleak of a fiction year? Sad. There is little about the story that of Pi made me feel compassion for his circumstances and condition. The writing is decent, but nothing more. The book is quite short and could have been printed on half of the pages used. I recommend getting this one at the library, if at all."
2,No strong narrative voice or emotion,"The idea for this story is interesting--a boy and a tiger share a life raft together and try to survive. Yet I never found the main character's voice to be strong and original. Instead, there was just the author, calmly relating events. I did not feel emotionally engaged with the character, so I never got pulled into his story."
4,My review,I think it is an amazing story that I will re-read in the coming future! I'm in 8th grade and I loved it I hope you do to!
3,Confused,I was a little confused at the end. What story happened. In the beginning there is mention of an uncle that talked a lot of the sea?
3,Reality or Delirium?,"Life of Pi is a fascinating story about a struggling writer who stumbles upon the story of Pi, the longest surviving person adrift in a life boat at sea. Sharing a small lifeboat with a 450 pound Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker, Life of Pi is an unbelievable story of animal behavior and human perseverance and ingenuity. The story is really too fantastic to believe and yet there is enough concrete proof to wonder if it may have been true."
3,I expected more....,"When I was reading the opening credits to this book it said that it would make me believe in God. After reading that I expected an amazing, life-changing book! It was not that great. It was entertaining, but so is a good movie which would take less time to finish. I've read quite a few more books that have significantly changed my life more than Pi. Sorry to disappoint."
4,Fantastic surprise,"I had the pleasure of reading this book without knowing anything about it ahead of time - I didn't know who liked it or disliked it, or why, didn't know what it was about, and when I started reading it, had no idea where the story was going. Thoroughly enjoyed it! When I got to the end, I immediately turned back to the beginning and started reading it a second time. I can't remember the last time I've been interested in or intrigued by a book enough to do that. My best wish for you is that you find it before hearing too much about it."
2,I didn't get it,"I don't get why everyone loved this book. Besides the fact that my suspension of disbelief never kicked in, I didn't understand what point the author was trying to make: that any religion is acceptable even if you have to make it up yourself? I don't know. But the fact that I was even asking this question proves that the book wasn't working for me the way it should. With my favorite fiction I never ask what the point is--I just enjoy it."
3,School Book,"We had to read the Life of Pi for a school assignment. It was definetly not something I would choose on my own. Part One of the book was amazing! So witty and fun, I adored it. Part Two sagged along and I thought it was a little disgusting and would never end. Part Three was hilarious and the perfect way to wrap up the story! Yann Martel is a very good writer, I just wasn't too crazy about the story. I'm not sure if I could say I liked it, but I didn't dislike either. If you are into survival stories I would read Life of Pi, it was undiscribable."
3,Good writing but not a stellar book,"I am surprised by how many friends overwhelming recommended this book. I read it because of that. The story started well enough and showed a lot of promise. But, the second half of the book was a bit of a let down. So, the whole reading experience is only so-so for me."
4,Catch A Tiger By The Toe,"I really liked this novel, even though at the time I had been required by a course to read it.I found Martel's storytelling to be right on point, and I loved the twist at the end - I won't ruin it for you. Though the scenery was mainly static for the majority of the novel, I think the author did a great job keeping that static from turning into stagnant. Being drawn out just enough suspense-wise to keep you guessing, it was an effective move. The 'island' in the novel was also a fantastic addition - I was unaware such things are even rumored to exist.The ending was a little ripe in my opinion, but outside of that it was a solid 4/5."
4,Life of Pi,"This book taught me many things; interesting things about animals, about life, love and loss, and strength to survive. Excellent!"
4,More than just a Tiger,You may think that this is a story about a man in a lifeboat with a Tiger after the ship taking him and his father's zoo animals to Canada is sunk. But it's much more than that. Martel's description of his life in India and his dabbling in 3 different religions could make a separate book in its own right. And the story of his survival after more than 200 days drifting across the Pacific is gripping. Then there's the ending that leaves you wondering about what you have just read. An usual book but a compulsive read.
5,I love Pi,Great read about a boys survival at sea. Which is the real story? The story with animals or the story with humans? You be the judge.
4,Interesting Read,"I must admit I was very surprised when I came to the end of the book, not what I expected, but in reflection understandable."
4,Life of Pi,A pretty good book. The first part read slow. Glad I read before watching the movie which I will do once it comes out on DVD. Couldn't imagine being shipwrecked!
4,SPOILER -- Don't read if you haven't finished the book,I didn't want to post a review -- just ask some questions of others who have read this book.In terms of symbolism -- what did you understand the meerkat island to represent?What is your interpretation of the meeting with the French castaway?
4,Something for the whole family!,A wonderful book to be enjoyed by the whole family. I have never read such an entertaining book. Very enjoyable!
5,Fresh Air,"This was an amazing book, I did not want the story to end, and when it did you felt like you have just been giving an awareness that few people understand. Then author lets the reader discover a simple lesson on the comprehension of faith. I highly recommend this book, very spiritual."
5,An absolute MUST read,A thoroughly engaging book that was very difficult to put down. I desperately wanted to believe it was a true story. An absolutely refreshing adult fable....worth a second read!!
4,Great adventure,"I bought and read this book twice, long before the movie came out. The movie was actually very true to the book, but - as always - the book contains quite a bit more detail about Pi's adventures at sea. Even if you've seen the movie, and know the spoiler surprise ending, the book's a great read."
4,Survival with God,"I feel that this book was quite an excellent story of how a young male survived a 227 day journey in the Pacific ocean with the help of god. This story was a little slow at the begining, yet at the second part of the book, its paced picked up quickly. I feel that many people would enjoy this book no matter what they like reading. It is an interesting story for all to enjoy."
4,This is a good story for young people.,Life of Pi is an allegory about a young boy with faith and and morals who confronts a satanic cult... The tiger of course is the anger and rage he carries around with him until he can confront those people who are responsible for his troubles and put a bullet between their eyes.... A good story don't you think?
3,"mmmm, not that fantastic...",I enjoyed the book however i actually expected more. Most people LOVE it and i just didn't. I liked it but didn't LOVE it. Some people apparently like that there's a question in the end about whether or not all the events in the book really happen the way the story was told. However the book did keep my interest so i would recommend it.
4,Stream of Flowing Water,"That was exactly how I felt once I finished reading this book. Started with a curious child story finding the meaning of life, reminded myself that I once was practising Buddhism and Christianity at the same time.Nicely crafted piece of work, with 'Pi' as a castaway, reminded me how strong human courage and spirit can be.Nicely twisted piece of work, with animals as his companions in the lifeboat, ended with clever replica of the story with human companions, leaves you pondering which one is true, flipping through the book cover, wondering if it's based on true story or fiction."
1,Not for the faint of heart.,"Quite graphic in parts, which made for difficult reading. Disappointing after such a promising beginning. I did not find the characters very compelling, and had to force myself through the very disturbing ending."
2,In the final analysis...L..A..M..E!,Gettimg into this book was easy and my hopes were raised for some worthwhile insight given the background of the author. However things were soon awash and lost in a sea of relativism. And its ending was predictably disappointing. Not worth the voyage.
4,A wonderful book.,I found this book a wonderful view of life. Not many of us could go through such a voyage.I think anyone who reads a great deal would enjoy this book.
2,"My Review Of ""Life Of Pi""","My review of Life Of Pi is that it was sort of boring and was long for no reason,but it could be appropriate for high school students. The main character Pi Petal was a very confusing young boy who never got to the point of his stories. In the book he goes on and on about the same topics which made the book boring and seem so long. He also would jump subject to subject which threw me off a couple times because I wasn't sure what he was talking about at that point in the book. However, this book for high school students is somewhat appropriate because he does introduce different writing styles, and also Pi the main character is a 16 year old boy, so its around thier age group and they could identify certain adventures with him. Overall, it was not a great book to me, but if i were a high school student i could have related more to Life Of Pi."
1,Had to give up on it,"I love to read and I read a lot of books of different styles. I heard about how great this book was, so I had high hopes for it.I started to read and got to page 40 and I was so bored and confused and kept having to go back. I decided not to finish it which VERY rarely happens. When I saw all the prizes that the book had won, I thought that I must need to give it another try.Well, I finally gave up on page 68. I guess it's just not my cup of tea."
3,The Life of Pi,"Piscine (Pi) Molitor Patel is the main character in this story. He is a boy from India who is imaginative and insightful. His carefree life changed drastically when his parents decided to move from India to Canada. The boat that they sailed upon, the Sim Sum, unexpectedly sank in the Pacific on the way to Canada. The remainder of the story is the long drawn out explanation of what happened to Pi. The ending was a let down."
4,Life of Pi,"This is a well-written book that effectively uses humor and metaphors. I rated this with 4 stars only because it was well written and people who enjoy reading gory details might appreciate reading this.I read this book as a reading assignment for our book club. I do not recommend this book to other women like myself since it contained gruesome, graphic details on animals getting ripped to shreds. Since I love animals--all kinds--I found this difficult to read, but I still read the entire book in time for our book club discussion.However, I liked the character Pi and enjoyed the author's sense of humor. I had to find out how Pi was rescued."
3,Endurance wannabe,"This book reminded me of Endurance - the story of Shackleton's gone-wrong expedition to the South Poll - in it tells how human beings can overcome great adversity. The story is well written and hard to put down. However, I would recommend the story of the Endurance because it is a true story. I also found that the story's most enjoyable part was not the voyage across the Pacific Ocean but the boy's struggles to pick a religion at the beginning and the reaction of his family and friends after they discover he has become a Hindu, Christian, and Muslim at the same time."
1,Cannot Imagine People Say They Believe in God After Reading,this book. It makes me sad that it was awarded the same prize as Last Orders. It is really mediocre.
1,Extremely boring!,"I read constantly, and I can honestly say that this is the most boring book I have ever read. I was very disappointed. I am surprised by the positive reviews. The beginning was decent but it went downhill fast from there and never recovered."
5,"Simple, touching and poignant","Yann Martel tells the story of a boy and a tiger with such simplistic ease that somewhere in the corner of your mind, you wonder if he is playing with your head. His description of the zoo and all the animals is so vivid and brilliant, the picture he paints of Pondicherry so colorful and the way that he finds so many distinctive and vibrant characters in the middle of a cold, pale and meaningless ocean is simply unforgettable.In his own subtle way Martel reminds you that there is a God up there, in any form or avatar you seek him. He doesn't throw religion at your face but makes you look through the eyes of a teenage boy who is trying to discover his faith. He does find that that faith and that combined with his willpower to live and his devotion to life and God's love, he survives to tell his tale.Prathima Rodrigues"
3,Six out of ten,"Life of Pi is in my opinion a six out of ten. The novel is unique and well written, but at the same time the author can wander from the plot. The actual shipwreck doesn't occur until a quarter into the book (the book is 400 pages long). The novel overall is a decent. The mental plot behind it is very intriguing; Pi's thought process and opinions on thing can really make you think! Life of Pi also gives you a good insight in on different religions ,and gives you a new way to look at them.So overall I recommend Life of Pi to people who are good readers and do not have short attention spans because the book can be boring at times. Pi is a great character whom we can all relate to. I also recommend it to children over 13 because it can be hard to understand, and enjoy Life of Pi!"
5,Excellent,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. The descriptions it contains and the story line are inspiring to say the least. A must for any animal lover, explorer or dreamer."
4,Life of Pi,"This book starts pretty slow, when he talks about his life and schooling in India,but if you keep reading it gets a lot better after he is shipwrecked. The book ends with a complete turn of events that leaves the reader questioning what he/she has read. All in all, a good book."
5,Take A Ride On The Wildside,"What an amazing audiobook. The reader is just amazing. His voice reeled me in easily. I heard most of the book during a drive from NYC to Washington DC to Washington, Virginia to NYC...and the end from NYC to Bedford Hills, NY. I laughed...and I thought about life intently from many of the profound words in this book. I HIGHLY recommend this one. It's such a great book. I plan to buy the new illustrated hardcover that will soon be released--I loved it that much. I learned so much.Lines that I loved:Nature draws the grandest pictures.Adventure beckons.To lose your mother is like losing the sun above you.To lose your father is lo lose the one whose guidance and help you seek who supports you like a tree trunk supports its branches.Fear is life's only true opponent.It's important in life to conclude things properly; only then, can you let go."
4,Simply astonishing,"This book gives you the chance to stop and think about what is important in life; your faith, your family, your mind. Everyone has a tiger in their boats, we may feel alone and stranded in middle of the Pacific Ocean or may get blinded by our daily needs. Maybe not. Pi faced that and more yet survived. It is the miracle that we see everyday. The miracle of life.Enjoy."
2,Meh.,I really enjoyed the first third of this book. Then it got to be too fantastic. Then it got boring.Finally I read the ending. Meh. Do yourself a favor and get it out of the library or go buy it at the Good Will.
3,I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK SIX STARS IF I COULD!,"One of the best stories , l ever read , it contained all the levels of the human spirit.This would be great book , for High school reading"
2,Could not finish the book.,"I find this book quite boring and I couldn't finish it. Digressions, dreams... I couldn't follow the author where he wanted to lead me. I quit after 120 pages."
2,Great short story w/ 300 unnecessary pages,"This book came highly recommended, but was for the most part a letdown. The first one-fifth or so of the book was so boring that I put it aside for a year and then picked it up later after I was told that, yeah, the beginning is boring but you have to push through because it's such an amazing book. Most of the rest of the book is relatively more readable, but there was a lot of tedious technical description that I don't really want to spend my time on in fiction. I kept wondering ""when is the payoff for all this?"" Finally in the last 50 pages you do get to the payoff, and it is okay, but not so great that it redeems the previous 350 pages. In summary, 90% of the book is an overly-elaborate setup for a ""punchline"" that is somewhat interesting, but by no means mind-blowing."
3,Really weird book,I have to say that I found some of this book really interesting and I found I did get into the main story. I just found the whole defense of zoos thing laughable (and it IS supposed to be serious). I just can't go along with a lot of his reasoning. The ending was disappointing and put a whole different spin on the novel- a spin that I truly didn't care for at all. Don't buy it- borrow from the library instead.
5,Loved it.,Too random to feel genuinely made up. Too far fetched to feel real. Wonderful story. It is very much like a dream that you believe was real.
3,"If five stars belong to Tolstoy, Hemingway, etc., then . . .",Read it quickly and with some interest--the same interest that attaches to other survival stories from plane wrecks in the Andes to Donner Pass crossings in mid-winter. The writing and storytelling is competent. A survivable piece of literature offering some keen insights into the human condition it is not.
1,philosophy for morons,"This book is the kind of shallow meaningless tripe that makes not-so-bright people feel sophisticated. Right down to the cop-out ending, it's a mishmash of trite cliches, meaning-of-life tidbits at about the level of the old ""Kung Fu"" TV series, and...a premise he ripped off from another writer's book! If you liked ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" you're sure to love this. But if you have a real mind, stick to Rushdie."
2,Did he survive with a tiger or not.,I would like to rate this book because it was a selection.That we read for my Barnes & Noble book group some time ago.I would like to say that I liked it but I did not. I found itrather far out there. I did not like the character of Pi at all.
1,This book sucked !,"""Man eating trees?"" I have never read such putrid filth in my entire life. This book has the worst plot and story of any book I have ever read. I have no Idea where the author was able to dig up such stupid Ideas but he must have tried pretty hard to make a book that is this bad. The only reason I ever touched such a stining pile of dinosaur dung is because I had to read it fo a language arts project. The book is full of completely random and stupid Ideas that it kept leaving me with questions that I sure as hell did not want answered.I think that the writer should be blacklisted and never alowed to publish his work ever again."
2,Made me stop believing in the Booker,"I thought it was painfully unfunny, misleading about zoology and snide about faith. Many zoo tigers spend their lives pacing a small area until they get euthenized or worse to make room for baby tigers and the bigger crowds and revenue they draw. And I never expect good things when a discussion of faith starts off with the guy declaring his spiritual development is better than that of many people. I hope the Booker will resume honoring better titles."
3,Good Read,The Life of Pi is a interesting story of a boy who must survive in the middle of the ocean after his family's tragic death in a boating accident. Unfortunately at the time of the accident they are moving their zoo buisness with them which eventually leads to Pi being on a boat with a tiger. He struggles to not be eaten and find land. This book reads like nonfiction and gives a realistic view of the brutality of survival.
3,Too much expectation,"I liked the story, it's cute, but not life changing, as I had come to expect from the TV interviews with Mr. Martel and reviews I read. It's a fairy tale for adults. I recommand it if you want to read something to relax."
2,For School,"I read this book along with the rest of my World Litterature class. I did not enjoy it very much, being that I am an action book reader. I enjoy reading military non-fiction, and Star Wars novels, so this is most likely my reason for not enjoying Life of Pi. Had Pi landed on an island with a bunch of war lords or some sort of other armed persons, perhaps this book would have been enjoyable for me. I find the far fetched storyline extremely troublesome. If a book is supposed to be fiction say so and treat it that way."
3,Slow Cooked Pi,"Once I reached the end, I had enjoyed reading the book. The beginning was agonizingly slow. All that set up about religion and the zoo and the family...pretty dull. I was expecting a survival story, not a treatise on religious philosophies. Sorry, I don't read to tax my brain...I read to escape. I did enjoy the ending...slight twist and all. I can understand now why M. Night Shyamalan is interested in filming this book. So, if you can get past the slow beginning and get to the meat of the story, you'll enjoy it."
5,Pass over this one at your own peril,"The vast differences in genre, setting, and narrative technique notwithstanding, this book is a fictionalcounterpart to Primo Levi's ""Survival in Auschwitz.""This book, as you are reading it, will not let you go, and you,when you've read it, will not be able to let it go.If you do read it, two tips:1. Not at the dinner table and not on a full stomach.2. Don't be too quick to think you know who or what Richard Parker really is, or that he is just or only who Pi sayshe is. Consider the possibility that each of us isin fact in the same spot existentially as Pi and we eachhave our own Richard Parker to contend with. Do youknow who yours is?"
3,Just okay,"Lots of description, lots of technical stuff about boat parts, not too much action. I am interested to see how this was turned into a movie."
4,The movie was better,"Watched the movie first, so I wanted to read the book and see how much difference was there. I personally found the movie to be better and book to be lacking in depth."
1,"gristly, pointless, stupid","Boring, gruesome, insipid and irrelevant details, no point, nothing thought-provoking, and not even good writing.I read a great deal. I love great books. This is not a great book. How could so many people have given it so many stars? And it won an award?!"
2,Disturbed author,"This book is billed as some religious coming-of-age story, but I must of missed that part. The bulk of the book describes a man adrift on a raft with a tiger. The man does some pretty disgusting stuff, and then at the end, you're left wondering if any of it really happened.The writing is colorful, but I didn't feel any closer to God after reading it.If drinking turtle blood and eating Tiger feces is your thing, then read this book, otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time."
4,Unexpected pleasure,"Life of Pi was a Book Club pick, one that I had no opinion about, certainly not a book I wanted to purchase. When my friend loaned me her copy, I was finished with it in 2 days. I have since recommended it to everyone I know.I loved this book. I was drawn in immediately. Pi is a wonderful, sweet, sympathetic character, wide-eyed and open to God in any persuasion. He is a young man devoted to his family and his land. I loved Mr. Martel's descriptions of India. It's like being there.When I gave my husband a rough summary of the book, he remarked how boring it must be to read an account of a boy and a tiger, on a lifeboat in the Pacific for 227 days. You'd think so, but you'd be wrong. This book is never boring. It's incredibly hard to put down. My only complaint are the few extremely fanciful chapters involving a Frenchman and an island of sugary algae. What was involving became incredulous and was never dealt with in a satisfactory way to me."
4,Wild Story,"This, for me, was an incredibly slow story to start. In fact, the short chapters had me worried I downloaded the wrong thing, but once the story got to the life boat and animals I couldn't put it down! It ended pretty dark and a twist I was not expecting. All in all, for someone who usually reads more fantasy/fiction, I definitely recommend this book for someone looking for a wild story!"
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All I can say is you simply MUST read this book! It is unique, spiritual, humourous, and heart-breaking. It will melt you and make you want more.......I love this book! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!"
4,this one is for all the survisor fan out there,"the book itself is very interesting, as told by Pi, the teenage boy from India. growing up with animals(dad is a zookeeper), had to learn to deal with tiger on a lifeboat for 200 some days. the story was told smoothly, some parts are no doubt gross ( he told us how he kill fish, and turtles). but once you are done with the book, you feel a sense of relief. i have to say, I fall in love with the tiger, and Pi. no doubt you would too.Pi also shared his view on a lot of things, such as the zoo, animal. it really makes you think the way the world works. i only give 4 stars, cuz the book does go into graphical details to make it believable, and i find it it's too much"
2,Too much hype,"After seeing all the hype surrounding this book and reading nothing but good reviews, I had to buy the book to find out for myself. And after putting so much expectation on the book, I began to read. While I was reading I realized, it wasn't that great!Sure, it has it's good parts. But I found myself dragging through to the end- when I usually finish a book in a few days, this took a few weeks. It's a bit unexplained at times and it trails off at parts. I just wasn't as impressed as the rest of the world. I think I just had too many expectations. But, to each his own!"
1,"Awful, just awful","I really don't understand what the appeal is of this book. The book starts out with a REALLY long and preachy section that was mainly an opportunity for the author to lecture us about religion. Then comes the boat adventure which is the heart of the book. But even that part was botched imho. For some inexplicable reason, the author chose write and write, and then just end it abruptly, seemingly lazily as if ""eh, you get the picture, I won't bother telling you the rest..."". And then the ending is as bad as the beginning, extremely anti-climactic, and again another preachy section, telling us (of all things) about storytelling.This is easily one of the worst fiction books I've ever read. And I just really don't understand what the appeal is of this book for so many people."
4,Life of Pi,"This book is beautifully written, a little long in some areas but overall I am very glad I read it"
4,Interesting,Start of book a little hard to follow but became easier as story fell into place. I enjoyed it and recommend it.
5,Difficult Read,"This book was , at times, tiresome and at other times , disturbing on many levels. And yet, when all is said and done,it's a story of courage in the face of unthinkable hardship. It is truly a story of the triumph of the human spirit!"
3,A 95% good novel,I honestly cannot understand why this novel is supposed to be a better book WITH the final five chapters than it would have been without it.
2,Spirtitual and religious mumbo-jumbo misrepresented as adventure fiction!,"Don't believe the hype on this one!Unless you are looking for a philosphical or spritual awakening this is not the novel to read. It is incorrectly marketed as an adventure in the Robert Louis Stevenson or ""Old Man and the Sea"" tradition. Supposedly, the adventure involves an 8-year-old Indian boy trapped on the lifeboat from a downed ship where the only inhabitants are himself, an orangutang, zebra, hyena and a tiger. Pretty soon, there is only the boy and tiger remaining.What should have been the premise for a highly unique high-seas adventure qucikly devolves into a spirtiual parable where the story the boy tells upon rescue may not even be the truth but a mere symbolic retelling of his search for God. The boat sinking doesn't even take place until 120 pages into the novel.Well written -but dull and ending abrubptly and in a quite unsatisfying manner."
4,Great survival story!,"This book didn't make me believe in God but it was a great survival story. I wouldn't have thought so from reading the book jacket, but the adventures of Pi were entirely plausible! I was completely caught up while reading of his trials at sea.The beginning of the book was boring and I almost stopped reading it. I'm glad I persevered. I didn't care about the religious or parable aspects - I read it strictly for the adventure aspects."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable book,"Great writing, storytelling, and a unique story... overall a very engaging book."
3,Great Ending,"If you can get through the first 100 or so pages of this book, it's a wonderful read. Even if you are very interested in the subject matter, the first half of the book moves slowly. Still, it's worth hanging around for the ending!"
2,A dissapointment,"This book was higly recommended in various publications, so I was looking forward to reading it. I generally like books that are ""different"" (Gabriel Garcia Marquez etc.) but this book left me cold. I think it might be that I had recently read ""In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex"", which is a better (and true!) account of being lost at sea. Except for the fantasy element of the Tiger, this is basically the same story. I have to agree with another reviewer that the whole segment on the island was awkwardly out of place. The book simply did not live up to the hype."
2,"Highly anticipated, very disappointing.","I don't have much to say other than that this book should not be put in the same category as books claiming religious revelations. This book proved fiction is more interesting than life, and did a disservice to the belief in God. I read it with the whole 'God' concept in mind, and it should not be put in it's advertising. Merely a ploy to get people to read the book. The protagonist is very religious but the story does nothing to inspire belief in god, which it falsely claims. This is a subjective opinion but I belief it falsifies the belief more than anything."
5,talk about symbolism!,"What an outstanding read! It is necessary to read more than once - first literally and then symbolically. The more you read it the more you will see in it. The story is smooth and funny, serious and appalling. The writing is a pleasure to read. If you want more out of your books than fluff, this is the book for you. It should be used in classrooms - a great teaching tool for student writers."
2,"Interesting, but not a favorite","Although creative, this book was not one of my favorites. It was EXTREMELY slow to start. Other than establishing Pi's personality, the religious theme did not seem to fit with the rest of the book.Ironically, the story turned to a plot of ""Survival of the fittest"", more about evolution than religion. Although I understand the realism of ""Survival of the fittest"", the graphic descriptions re: the animals being destroyed bothered me.Pi was a brave and resourceful character, but overall, I struggled to get through this book. I read it in a week, and was very happy to finish it."
4,a fun read,I found this book a little slow to start but once it got going it really a book I didn't want to put down. I would call this book full of imagimation and delight.
4,Good book,Very deep and literal full of food for your mind. Food friendship courage endurance and perseverance. Key attributes of books character. Opens up the door of your imagination
3,Chinese dinner book,"I qualify this book as a 'Chinese Dinner Book:I know I've read a book, I just don't feel like I've read a book.The premise of the book was very interesting, and it was full of vivid detail and the right mix of fact and whimsy. I found myself loving the character of Pi, as really feeling a sense of understanding this character because we journey with him during this growth.That being said...there were a lot of times I felt this was a very disjointed novel, and the story sometimes let my mind wander...which isn't good for a novel. By the time I finished, it was like 'OK...I know a character...but what's the story?'I can't recommend this unless you have an airtight attention span."
4,Loving Pi (mostly),"The book jacket of Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, declares that it is a novel ""that may, as one character claims, make you believe in God."" Life of Pi tells the story of Piscine Molitor Patel, a young Indian boy who finds himself stranded in a lifeboat on the Pacific Ocean with an odd crew of companions, one of which is a tiger. Martel's vivid and imaginative storytelling makes it so the reader experiences Pi's adventure with him: the feelings of isolation being adrift on the Pacific Ocean, the overwhelming loss of being orphaned, the fierce competition for survival, and the overwhelming fear of what each new day may bring.Although the way Martel ends the book leaves something to be desired(dredging up some minor characters to figure out the real life of pi), the book is a worthy read if just for Martel's vivid descriptions of life at sea and the book's spirit of adventure and survival."
4,something different,"Although I enjoyed this book I found some areas of the novel a bit slow paced but I think that was the ultimate goal of the author's:to feel as Pi does floating around the ocean for months. However, the parts that were exciting compensated and would keep one reading for more. the ending is excellent and now want to read Life of Pi again to put the clues together."
3,Missing paragraphs,Unfortunately my copy (bought for daughter in last year of school - book mandatory for advanced English studies) was missing 7 chapters.Unfortunately again - the 7 chapters missing form the book are of course the ones that the students are discussing and reviewing.Unfortunately - and what a pain in the neck - I need to go and buy another copy of this book - one with the 7 chapters included.I'll buy it in a real book store so I can check that the chapters are included.Daughter (17 yrs) said the book was a pretty good read even if a chunk of it was missing. She really didn't understand the ending though - not until it was discussed at school.My advice is to buy this book from another publisher.
4,"An excellent story, a great read!","Life of Pi: Deluxe Illustrated EditionI listened to this on audio, my son is reading it for a summer reading list. A great book."
5,"Great book, incredible ending","A great book that I couldn't put down. I had heard people either loved or hated this book and I absolutely loved this book. The last line I let out a great laugh. Just to give you an idea of how much I couldn't put this book down, I finished this book over the course of the week before my wedding and during the honeymoon. An awesome book that I think you should read."
3,Not what I expected,"I still have not seen the movie. I usually read the book before I see a movie based on a book. I am wondering how they made this movie anywhere accurate. Surely the animals on the lifeboat would not be real. I almost did not read the second part as the first part was not very interesting to me. It was long and drawn out. The second part of the book (Pi's ordeal) was not very believeable, but was interesting to read how Pi figured out his problems and solved them. The tiger gave excitement to the story and, also, there was a twist when he was blind for a short time and met another blind person who was also shipwrecked. The island gave an interesting break from the tedious everyday existence Pi was living to survive."
3,The Life of Pi,"Interesting story and imagery! The descriptive passage are amazing.Some of the pacing is confusing, going back to the ship wreck."
1,Hated it!,HAD to read it because someone in my book club suggested it. Couldn't wait to get through it. One person in my group liked it - the rest felt the same way that I did. Turns out that the person suggesting the book had heard from friends that the MOVIE was good..... Waste of time for sure!
2,Darker than expected,Very dark book. Would have been ok if he didn't include the real ending. I would not recommend the book.
3,"Interesting storyline and written well, but did not really leave a lasting impression",I thought it was a clever story but expected something more for some reason. I have read other books from the author and enjoyed them more.
4,Great bargain...,Just haven't read it yet. Nicely packaged and great condition for a used book. I really like the option of nearly new.
3,Life of Pi,"The tale reminded me a little of the old Sabu romps, except for the grit and gore endured by the main character. I did laugh at the ending...a sort of ""if you don't like that one, try this one"" approach. Just left me wanting."
2,Difficult to read,"In light of the graphic depictions of gory killings, I found this book hard to read and I decided not to see the movie since it too is probably very violent."
5,Wonderful book!,I ordered this to read on my iPad. Quick delivery. Wonderful page-turner. Exciting and informative. Then saw the movie. Amazing!
2,LIfe of Pi review,"I am trying to slog through this book because I bought it, but I don't like it. Now I am only half way through but that should give me a pretty good idea of the book's content and pace. It seems slow and unrealistic. The part of the beginning about the zoo and his religious experiences held my attention, but since the freighter sank and he explains his experiences on the lifeboat, I have lost interest. I don't know that I will finish the book."
3,Took Forever,"Found myself skimming through many of the beginning chapters to get to the story. Very repetitive at times. Glad I finished it, ending chapters were a surprise."
3,a bit boring,I downloaded this book to read on my flights to and from South America. I have yet to finish this book as I find it boring.
1,Life of Pi,I love this story and had read it before but given it away. This edition has a terrible ugly thick font and was done on the cheap and is not a pleasure to read as a result.
1,Plumline seller,"I ordered what was described as a Mass Market Paperback in New Condition. The order was sent out several weeks late, is NOT a Mass Market Paperback, and is anything but new. Looks and smells like it's been sitting in someone's basement for 10 years. I will drop it off at Half Price Books and purchase a new one from a local book store. Shameful lie."
3,Life of Pi,really looked forward to the read...It was just okI think the movie would be better...I was just a little disappointed in the book.
4,Book was in Good condition. Great story! Loved reading it.,This is a very enjoyable story. It starts our a little mundane but will pick up your interest after a few pages.
4,Just a boy and an adult Bengal tiger.,"Amazingly subtle story telling with some beautiful and at times graphic details. More spiritual than religious. A terrific read filled with adventure,heart and wisdom about the human spirit and our will to survive."
3,"A slow, interesting read","I have to admit I almost gave up on this book when I first started to read it. I felt like quite a bit of background information was given unnecessarily. But, once you get into the second part of the book things pick up. It was still a slow read, but it was very fascinating."
4,Life of Pi,"Spiritual, masterfully and beautifully written book. Makes your imagine come alive! Worth a read for sure. Movie is also wonderful"
4,Great story and more than good writing,"I've often thought that a mediocre writer could tell a great story well; it takes a superior writer to make a story out of poor soil. This is a great story and the writer has crafted extra dimensions out of a great tale with imagination and style. From this reader's perspective the book does not resolve well all of the themes of the story, but I enjoyed the story the author decided to tell. I'm not sure I want to see the movie. I think it would be impossible to do the book justice."
4,Interesting,I became interested in reading this book when I saw previews for the movie. I found the book to be very well written but it did not capture me as seems to have others (based on the volume of positive reviews). I think this one of those novels that grabs you on a spiritual (meaning of the spirit not in the religious sense) level or it does not. I was hoping for more.
4,emotional reading,"The kindle technology worked just fine - as always. I like the convenience of having my book on my phone, my iPad and my computer, so wherever I am, I can pick up where I left off. As for the book itself - it is great - but the emotions, and the unhappiness, and the descriptions of the physical agony of people and animals, make it an emotionally tough read. Worth it, but not pleasant."
5,i love it,Its really amazing book. It has given details of many unseen places and creatures uncredible behaviour of bengal tiger. This is a book worth reading.
4,very good,"Interesting story line. Martel creates a narrative with his main character, Pi that is convincing and holds reader's attention. Half way through the novel I had to remind myself the book is a work of fiction. I enjoyed the Life of Pi and would recommend it."
5,A Painful Journey,"I close sad books and command myself not to finish them, but I always do, and regret it, until Life of Pi. It didn't convince me of a loving god, as it promised in its beginning, but this brilliant work gave me the kind of laughter that only comes after a tragedy--the kind you never want to need, and the only kind that has the power to lighten a heavy heart."
2,It could have been SO great!,"Like the rest of those who didn't like the book, I too was most intrigued by the first 1/4 of the story. The other 3/4 seemed to have nothing to do with the beginning, was bogged down with violence and gore I wish I hadn't trudged through. Some people said that those who really love animals shouldn't read this- they're right. I adore animals, and hearing about their suffering with no satisfactory ending was most frustrating. I am surprised by how many people praise this book when it seemes so thoroughly unconnected to itself. (I gave it two stars because the beginning was SO good. If only he'd continued in that direction, it might have made for a fantastic book.)"
3,"Didn't love it, didn't hate it.","Life of Pi took a while for me to get into but after about half way through, it got interesting and I couldn't put it down. The descriptions made me feel like I was living the story. I'm glad I read it but wouldn't call it a must read."
5,Great story!,"Very well written with a twist ending. I can't wait to see the movie, but I cannot imagine it will be as good as the book."
2,"A nice, bland something","If you enjoyed the movie Cast Away featuring Tom Hanks without feeling anxious (or that the story could have unfolded in half the time), Life of Pi is not bad. If you have a vested interest in eloquent literature, I would let this one float on. Not a bad book, not a bad story, very simple read. I found the exposition of the story to be the most entertaining aspect of the book. For a story of courage and endurance, Life of Pi was bland, in my humble opinion."
5,Fascinating,"This book provides food for thought on many levels--what both animals and humans experience, and the question of reality lived or perceived."
5,Captivating,"Did not ever think I would like a story of (shipwreck) survival, and with a tiger at that! Sounded incredulous, but the plot is a page-turner, the language beautiful - check out some original similes and clever analogies used, and an ending that was indeed unexpected and though-provoking. Must read this before watching the movie!"
5,Great read,"Excellent detail, edge of your seat anticipation entire book. I hope everyone can have a chance to enjoy this novel."
4,Life of PI,"Really enjoyed this book, but was puzzled by the ending. Wished it had been different, but don't know in what way."
4,Pi,Amazing story told in great detail the writer did an excellent job of making the reader feel like they are in the story
4,Life of PI,"I loved this story, although there was more violence than I care for. It's unusual to find book this entertaining."
5,Great,"""Life of Pi"" is a book for all ages, an intelligent book with a protagonist that you cant help but cheering for. The story can get really honest and really desperate for Pi, but in end he comes through.The story also has a twist in the end, which wraps everything together. Read this one before Hollywood butchers it.Classic, a masterpiece"
4,Interesting,"I had not seen the movie trailer before reading this book. After reading it, I might not see the movie due to the amount of disturbing animal suffering :/ I'm am still curious to see how they would get around this constant suffering to satisfy movie standards of the US."
5,Modern Day Noah?,"When 16 year old Piscine finds himself in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific, with a zebra, orangatan, hyena, and a Bengal tiger, he has to use his wits to survive. When his ordeal finally ends, 277 days later, he has to use his wits to return to society. 'The Life of Pi' is a compelling, complex, theological, thoroughly enjoyable book that will leave the reader sifting through it's many levels for a long time after finishing it. I think the interpretations of what this book really meant will be as varied as the readers. This book certainly outperformed all it's expectations for me. 5 Stars!"
5,Captivating,"I downloaded this book around lunch time and did not put it down until I finished reading it. I was captivated from the beginning. As I have traveled to may places around the world, I feel that Yann Martel's vivid descriptions of India as seen through the eyes of Piscane were very well written. It took me on an incredible adventure as the book progressed, both spiritually and emotionally. I highly recommend this book to any reader who loves to get lost in a good book."
5,Gorgeous edition of a great book,"A riveting tale of a boy's fight for survival when stranded at sea with minimum supplies and a Tiger for company. A well written, emotional story that never lets up. This hard cover edition is beautifully illustrated and adds to the overall experience. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
2,Do Not Tease a Tiger....You lose a limb.,"It says in the the early chapters that this story has a happy ending? Well I failed to see it.Which leads me to another aspect of the ending, It is unwise to allow a Tiger to escape into the wild without food, water or supervision. He might come back and make a meal of you.I expect there will be a sequel strictly from the Tigers perspective, because the two cannot survive together.Youve been warned and that is the last I am going to say about it."
1,LIFE OF PLAGIARISM,"This books plot was blantantly stolen from a novel called Max and the Cats.(So much for originality!) Maybe that's why the banal herd loves it so much!!! Geee! Wow! ""This book is amazing!""Recycled pseudo-theological cardboard on water, that is WHAT this book really IS. If you like hackneyed pulp, i.e., ""The Dumb Vinci Code,""this stuffed tiger fluff is for you. If you differ from the Oprah's Book Club Mob, hey, you might want to try reading the authentic book which this author ripped off. Either way, ENJOY! Geee!! Wow!!P.S. Sorry, I'm terrible at feigning hyper-ebullience on a book that doesn't deserve it...just like most of the pep squad reviews on this book are. Sorry. Gee! Wow!!"
2,Not too good,"I really had to force myself to finish this book for my book club. There were glimmers of brilliance, but overall I do not feel that those were plentiful enough to make up for the rest of the book. It was sometimes gory, sometimes boring...not a good read.I would not recommend this book - and I don't say that about too many books! Try something else. I think you will be happier."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Life of Pi is a massive mess. It's been a critical darling since it was first published, but believe me, this emperor has NO clothes. The literati have pulled a huge joke on the rest of us, and people are scared to admit how bad it really is."
3,Riveting?? I don't think so...,"As far as I am concerned, this is just a book - not a great book - just a book. Have I read better novels than this? Yes, many."
1,Ugh,A otherwise small and eventually engaging little tale that is contaminated by the grimy sludge of smug spirtuality.
1,BAD Book,"This book had the potential for being a good book. It has, however,unnecessarily descriptive cannibalism. You can make great film AND books without such violence. If this is why the book is selling so well, it's a sad comment on our society. It's even sadder it doesn't get mentioned in reviews.Right after I sent this review in the first time, I came across this true story online -MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Four members of a family have been arrested and charged with murder for allegedly killing and eating a relative during a wedding reception -- and serving his flesh to unwitting party guests, police have said."
4,One of those books that gets a person thinking,"Here's one of those metaphysical novels that are so popular these days. A year or two back, I saw people lugging this around everywhere I went, so it was time to check it out. This book is rare in that it entertains and provokes the reader's mind. The majority of the book concerns the narrator, Pi Patel, and his struggles while stranded on the Pacific Ocean with a tiger on a lifeboat. While it started a bit slow, the whole thing finishes up really strong. It got me thinking a lot about life's struggles, religion, and the triumph of the human spirit. I won't give away any more, since I want everyone to go read this."
1,Trying so hard to get through it...,"I have been trying so hard to get through this book since I have already paid for it but the writing is hard to follow, and its simply boring."
2,Disappointing,"The first half of the book I really enjoyed. But once he's on the liferaft, I hated it. Couldn't finish it in fact. What is supposed to be a brilliant and well crafted allegory comes across as flat and downright idiotic. I also diliked the main character so that probably didn't help. Overall, this book confirmed my dislike for contemporary fiction."
2,Undeserving of the booker prize!,"The author deserves praise for his creativity. This is an interesting story but it is probably not worth your time. I know a lot of readers who simply quit. I suffered through to the end. There is a hidden meaning, but you have to get through a lot of boring and tedious material to get to the end.If you don't have patience with slow moving stories, then I recommend you skip this one. On the other hand, it is simply written and relatively short and if you enjoy philosophy and animal stories you may find this a pleasant read."
2,Not as good as I expected it to be,"I had read other reader's reviews before my purchase, but I felt it might be somewhat interesting. Interesting if you want to read about a young boy trying to discover his religious stand & graphic descriptions of animals eating other animals & his survival skills down to eating the tigers excrement. Not for anyone who cannot handle the ""survival of the fittest"" in the food chain of life.I did find myself trying to visualize the events that were described in the book to make it more enjoyable. Lucky for Pi he was not in the part of the sea that has freezing waters or he would have never survived. I had to finish the book mainly to find out the fate of Richard Parker."
3,"Good style, bad promise","The style is great, but the message of this book is a dangerous one: Martel promises, that reading this story will bring back faith to God. But the story is based on fantasy. So if faith is based on fantasy, no thank you. I don't believe into this kind of faith. It has nothing to do with real faith, but quite the opposite.So I would give 5 points for the style, for the story itself, but zero points for the message."
5,A good book makes you think long after you have put it down,"Have you ever read a book (or seen a movie) that you weren't sure you liked but couldn't stop thinking about it? And you had to find someone to discuss it with?I began to really enjoy this book after Pi was shipwrecked, and then I found the story compelling. After I finished reading the book, I wasn't really done with it. I discussed it with others, went back and reread passages and thought quite a bit about the alternate endings. I still think about it.This, I think, is the definition of a good book, regardless of the story."
2,The ending has a lot to be desired.....,"Very lengthy book. It could have been made concise and to the point. The raft and the animals was a novel way of a kid surviving the pacific. Is it believable - definitely NOT. It is an adventourous book however, I will NOT reccomend to any family with children and/or kids.After I bought the book and read it I was so upset with the ending - I threw the book away. In fact I discussed with my friends that it is time that Books too have a rating standard if publishers are willing to publish this gibberish.To give credit- Martel starts the book very well and tells a new kind of adventure for young boys. After that it is all downhill."
2,Mediocrity At Its Best,"A boy stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger in the middle of the Pacific. It takes quite a masterful writer to make a story out of this premise, and let me tell you, Mr. Martel is not that masterful writer. The story starts slow, never builds a climax, and certainly does not end with a bang. Characters are marginally developed, and scenes are poorly described. I can't figure out why, but the book advertises itself as a story that makes you believe in God. Come to think of it though, there must be a God if a book like this can get published!"
3,eh...,"I picked this up on a whim from the library. Not a bad book, but not one I would recommend strongly."
2,Amusing... That anyone read it....,I found this book a total bore. Another example of the death of writing. I have read better cereal boxes.
1,Unglaublich,"How was the ship wrecked? How did the characters escape? The author glossed overs the details and presents a depressing, unbelievable story."
2,mediocre at best,"This book just wasn't very interesting once Pi's boat went down. I didn't feel like reading half a book about this situation. I like books with strong character development, and I this this book is lacking just that."
1,"A twisted mind promises to present you with God and gives you pointless, rewardless suffering instead","This was a tremendous disappointment. Yann Martel's Life of Pi will feed anyone hungry for the abhorrent and gruesome. But first the author will promise that his story will make you believe in God. After getting you curious there, he will distract you and hope that you forgot he said it - as he will not present you with anything there.This story is pointless, tasteless and instead of entertainment it will give you an upset stomach with no reward at all."
1,Tedious at Best,"I bought this book on the recommendation of GMA's ""book club"", of which I have read and enjoyed numerous selections. After starting to read this a couple of times, I finally got serious, thought there was some potential but it was tedious at best.A young boy, a Bengal tiger, a lifeboat with a raft in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days encountering all of mother nature's gifts - and reviewers say this is believable - no I dare say I don't think so. I understand that fiction doesn't have to be believable, but this story just doesn't flow well. To me the story rambles on day after monotonous day. I got to the point of skimming some of it just to get through yet another day of survival. Overall, not a book I would recommend."
4,Wonder how Hollywood movie will handle ALL of this book?,"The last fifty pages (and perhaps alternate ending ha ha) made and saved the book for me, though I might have gone in with much to high expectations given the fantastic reviews of this book. Great mix of religious and mystical (take a bow Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Paulo Coelho) writing, that is grounded by a gritty survival tale and observations in animal behavior. In the span of a couple pages Martel goes from writing near horror passages to painting emotional moodscapes or descriptive interactions between man and animal. Was never bored by this book, but also not as drawn in by it as I had hoped. Can understand why many think of it as a modern classic, worth anyone's time to read."
2,"A real disappoint, especially after the reviews","This is a classic case of overpromising and underdelivering. After reading some of the rave reviews here, we chose this book for our reading club, since it seemed to include a number of different themes and ideas for discussion. Unfortunately, it proved to be rather thin on both counts.One of the real disappointments was the lack of real, substantial religion and faith in this book. Pi is described as a boy who is drawn to his native Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam simulatneously. But there is no mention of what draws him, aside from a couple of nice men, and pretty accoutrements. No mention of what each religion was lacking which drew him to the others, or how he reconciled their contradictory elements. And this is just one of many disappointments.Worth reading. But don't expect too much."
2,Way overrated,"This is not a great book. It is merely an okay book with pretensions to greatness. Yann Martel (or the narrator) claims that this is a story to make you believe in God. Wow. That sets the bar pretty high. The book begins with a story about a little boy that loves all religions with equal fervor. But this theme is forgotten almost entirely. Overal, the book feels disunified, as if Martel didn't have a clear idea about what he was trying to say or how he wished to say it. The component parts don't necessarily work together. On top of this, Martel's prose is occasionally quite clunky. There were more than a couple of sentences that made me grimace. Martel obviously has some talent but also needs to mature a lot as a writer. I won't say you would be wasting your time reading this book, but there are a lot of books that in my mind would take precedence."
2,The Life of Pi,"I bought this book because it was nominated for the Booker Prize. Frankly, after reading it I was surprised the Booker committee had picked Mr. Martel as the 2002 winner. The book starts out fine -- Pi is an engaging character with an interesting life in Pondicherry. However, half way through the novel, Mr. Martel kills off Pi's family in a shipwreck and then it becomes a gruesome tale of survival at sea with detail descriptions of evisceration.I really don't understand how some your readers described the second half of the book as an ""incredible"" journey. It was a bloody, horrible story. And why does the inside sleeve of the say it's such a ""wondrous storytelling that it may make you believe in God."" Give me a break!"
3,Unbelievable!?,"Reading 'The Life of Pi' I was less and less sure what this story is meant to be - an adventure story? A dream? A philosphical/theological parabel? Until the episode on the strange floating island, I would have stretched my imagination and believed, that this might be an original and innovative story about the fate of a shipwrecked boy and his slow and intelligent adjustment to the circumstances. But the floating island with all its horrors was simply stretching it too far and cast basically a shadow of dreamy surrealism on the whole story. I finished the book thinking it to be drowning under the overly heavy burden of meaning. I do not feel enticed to read another one of Martel's books."
5,Great book!,"This book is easy to read, causes you to think, and pushes your imagination! Pi is a great character."
4,Deceptively deep and full of insight into human nature,"When I first finished this book I thought it was your typical over-hyped bestseller with nothing to it besides cliche lessons. After thinking about it for awhile and reading it a second time I began to understand that which I had glossed over before...the carnivorous island, the meaning of all of the animals, and even the ending. I enjoyed the story at face value even though it was a bit monotonous at parts especially with the boring lull of endless days and Pi's eating habits. Also, the opening line, ""After you read this you will believe in God"" was a bit much and I never quite believed in God even after all of the religious undertones of the narrative. The ending was probably my favorite because it made me question whether the story was true or not...whether the frivolity of human nature kept Pi alive. Either way it's a great story and quite refreshing."
2,It did not make me believe in God.,"The Life of Pi did not make me believe in God. It only reinforced what I already knew about man and animals-- that along the evolutionary trail, man and animals developed strong survival skills. Sadly, animals will never evolve intellect and spirituality. Is this realization the reason we would come to be made to believe in God? Sorry! It didn't work! The absurdity of life remains in the forefront and this story is just to silly and absurd."
3,Interesting premise,"An interesting tale of survival at sea, the Life of Pi offers a bizarre twist to the lost at sea genre. The narrative style of this book is engaging but I found at times that I just wanted to get to the end of the book as some of the descriptions of Pi's days at sea seem to go on forever."
4,Good Reading,"I had to read this for my book club. It was a bit slow at first, but I became intrigued and eager to find out how Pi survived with Richard Parker. Good book!"
2,A shipwreck,"Many parts of Life of Pi are well written and Martel has a unique writing voice. This story lagged in the middle and about halfway through the book, I was hoping that either a shark would eat Pi, the tiger would drown or they would both get rescued. The book is definitely based on a good idea and it sticks with the reader. However, the book wasn't worth my time and I don't understand all the hype about it."
2,False Pretense,"""I have a story that will make you believe in God."" This is the presumptive theme of the book. But reader beware. After you have navigated Pi's fantastic South Seas adventure, the narrator will slap you in the face with a very different theme: ""which story do you prefer?""; or in other words, God is good precisely because he is a fabulous relief from vile humanity.If yours is a postmodern devotion, then you will enjoy this book from beginning to end. You probably also enjoyed Umberto Ecco's ""Island of the Day Before.""Otherwise, you're likely to finish the book feeling disappointed after you skim through it, or manipulated if you read for meaning."
3,Not as good as expected,"I went in reading this novel with great expectations and for a while it did a good job satisfying them. But what could have been an extraordinary story written by lovely prose was tainted by the ""morale"" or ""aesop"" at the end. I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't read it, so all I'm gonna say is I can't get behind a message that is quite judgmental and illogical such as this one."
5,Enthralling!,Great writer! Amazing story! One that I will definitely read again. And one where the I'm sure the movie can never be as good as the book...
3,Life of Pi,"well written but, waffled on a bit, I would of liked a bit more story then waffle, a bit long in places."
3,Nothing special,"I can't figure what the hoopla is about. It's an OK adventure story with no suspense since it's first person narrative. Might be a good choice for high school as the prose is easy enough, and there are incidents a plenty. I guess I missed the point."
2,Not a fan,"I didn't enjoy this book. I know it was all the rage and with the movie coming out, I wanted to read the book prior to seeing the movie. I'm glad I did as it saved me $$ at the theater."
3,Disappointed!,I enjoyed the book but I was terribly disappointed that at the end Pi and the tiger nevermore to see each other. Just as Pi was beginning to gain headway with the tiger they are separated.
4,Crappy ending,This book was a page turner loved the religious side of it and loved how things were explained but so shocked at the ending don't know would I go to see the movie because the ending was absolutely stupid.
2,Slow read,Bought this book based upon the star rating. Apparently I read a different book than those who gave it 4-5 stars..never could get use to the many Indian references.
1,Life of pi,This book sucks no one read it u will want to throw it kindle . Out the . Windows cause this bookGave my kindle a virus
2,Too gory for me,I wanted to close my eyes as I read about the cruel animal killings. I skipped them and finally abandoned the book
1,Beyond boring,I don't know how the movie ever got made. The book is very boring . Read 80 pages and just can't get any further.
2,Good story,It was a story that is a little bit far fetched none the less an interesting read could have done better
2,Ewwww!,"The plot line is so compelling - fascinating - I would so love to get inside the author's head .. or thought I would until I read the scenes about Richard Parker eating fish, animals or humans ... or any of the savagery perpetrated amongst the animals ... and it so overshadowed the interest in the book. All I can say is, ""ewwwww!"""
5,This is a terrific book on so many levels!,"This is a vivid story of a young man's unbelievable journey. A rich parable, this haunting tale lingers and reveals things for weeks after finishing the actual book. It is a very interesting read, peaceful yet disturbing."
2,There is not much of excitement!,Kind of bored and disappointed with this book. This book is too elaborative and certain part of the book could be cut short.
4,Absorbing,"This is quite the read. I've been meaning to read it for awhile, and is chock full of emotion and storytelling that you'll really feel involved. I highly recommend this to anyone trying to decide whether to read this, and can say that you will enjoy it and possibly come out with a better philosophy on life, because this book also deeply explores what it means to be human, in more ways than one."
4,Life of PI,It is an amazing book after you get past halfway it is very good at using descriptive words and it leaves you wandering at the end of the book.
4,Storytelling at its best,"One of the most creative books I've read in a long while, Life of Pi was both educational and inspirational. As a fan of symbolism, my mind was on overdrive just thinking ""what's it all mean?"" Martel brilliantly weaves the animal's inherent instincts, behaviors and mystique into the story to make a desperate situation seem even more hopeless. I won't give it away, but when you're finished reading this book - I can almost guarantee you'll flip back to the front and try to find the clues you might have missed... Really, a great escape."
3,remove philosophy wrapper for great product inside,"The narrator says this story will make you believe in God. It does not. But it does make you believe in the power in fiction. What a great story! But it's as if Martel had to apologize for writing a fable, and tried to be more ""hip"" by adding the question about God, and the depressing ending which forces you to think about the role of fiction in our lives. But the ending does not cause us to think about God, like it claims."
4,Good book,"This is a very good book.I am really excited about the movie that is coming up in 2006.The first part was a little bit long, i read it in 4 or 5 days.The second part was excellent, i read it in one day.The conclusion was brillant, leaving you with a choice.I kept thinking about the end a couple of days after i read the book."
4,A book like no other,"This book is worth reading, simply because it is so original. As many other people said, it will make you laugh and cry, but that is because it has a very real human essence running through it. The end of the book disappointed some, but I think it was actually one of the best parts. It is all up to interpretation, but I think that if you read the very last line in the book, you will see that in the end, the magical journey really trumped ""logical sense""."
3,Great start but a disappointing finish,"I was walking through my local bookstore when I happened upon this book. I read the back and instantly became intrigued. I started reading it and found its start to be a little slow. I pressed on waiting for things to pick up and sure enough, they did. It is obvious throughout the book that Pi survives his ordeal but even though, I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. All the way through I was kept captivated but in the end all there was was disappointment. I liked the plot but I don't like how it leaves the uncertainty of what really happened. I think it would have been better if it just stayed simple but I am young and naive. My opinion is that only someone good at reading in between the lines would like this book."
4,"Hang on tight, but think while you do","A simple recipe - a boy involving himself in three religions simultaneously, dealing with a hated name, and leaving India and his father's zoo with some of its animals and his family to emigrate to Canada. Then, a shipwreck leaves Pi on a lifeboat with no other humans but more than one former member of his father's menagerie. Survival on his own is imperative. Doing so on an unforgiving sea with fellow passengers who might well construe him as a potential meal is seriously problematical. Since Pi tells the story in first person voice, obviously he survives, but what a journey! The journey's amazing. Pi's knowledge of animals proves lifesaving. If you're like me, the first half, before the shipwreck has enjoyable philosophical moments, but lasts a bit too long. It's worth getting through to the shipwreck. Be prepared to hold on tight with Pi. The ending is a most pleasant surprise, casting upon things a perspective I hadn't considered. A lovely read, all in all."
4,"A slow start, but a remarkable finish","I found The Life of Pi to be actually rather slow in the beginning. For the first 100 pages of the novel, I found myself wondering what the fuss was about. It was the latter 230 pages or so that opened my eyes to the greatness of this book. It's clearly one of the best, most intelligently-written, thoughtful books I've read this year.Pi's struggle for survival in the open sea is a story that I thought would be a struggle to make interesting for an extended period of time, but Martel really makes the story work. Every hardship endured by Pi is felt profoundly by the reader. Every struggle Pi goes through so thoroughly enraptures the reader that the ending is a complete, although logical and pleasant, surprise.Martel does a wonderful job of giving the reader their choice of alternative endings. The remarkable thing about this is how effortless he makes it appear. This is a powerful story of the strength of the human spirit and what a person can do to survive."
4,One of the best books I have read in a long time.,"This book started off slow, but once it got going you just couldn't put it down, and the ending made you really think."
4,This Amazon book was very different and recommended to me by a friend.,"This story is told by an Indian boy about his family, being a survivor of a boat sinking along with a tiger. He includes hi s parents, the zoo his father had in India and how he also survives being in a lifeboat with the tiger for over seven months."
2,Life of Pi,The first half of the book had what I considered graphic violence among the animals I have not finished the rest of the book because I was bothered by that. My friends say the book is wonderful and ends with a. Beautiful message. I may never know because of the extreme descriptions in the first part.
2,Middle part was dragged way too much,"Its ok , I bought because I heard about the movie , I think too much of a word is a loss of message same happened during middle pages. I felt like quitting the book but I read it anyway."
5,Absolutely a must read,"I heard an excerpt of this book on NPR and from that I was hooked. It is absolutely captivating, imaginative and beautifully written. It is a linquistic marvel. The situations that Pi experiences with Richard Parker are completely believable and breath taking. You will not be able to put this book down. There was not one slow part to the book that made me want to put it down. It is like a fine red wine that keeps opening up in its complexity and color, and then tickles your taste buds for more. The book has humor, drama, compassion and faith and they are blended so wonderfully. I would recommend to anyone who likes a great story."
5,Great story,"Well written, good English, very informative on animal behavior, kept me wanting to read more, couldn't put the book down, great story of survival."
4,Really Enjoyed The Book,"I really enjoyed the book. I was reading the book when we saw the movie. The movie did not explain a lot of things. Having read the book, I now understand what the mysterious island was all about and which of the two stories was the real story. The only down side was all the narrative about religions at the beginning of the book. It is an important part of Pi's life and helps explain how and what he thought about life. But there was way too much written about his religious beliefs. I started skipping through the religious stuff so I could get to the meat of what the book with all about. The other thing that confused me was the italic chapters. Having seen the movie while reading the book, I now understand it was the authoring interviewing Pi and had nothing to do with Pi's adventure."
4,LIFE OF PI,"I HOPE TO SEE THE MOVIE OF THIS FASCINATING BOOK. MARTEL IS ANOTHER GOOD WRITER. KEEP GOING MARTEL, AND I WILL ENJOY MORE OF YOUR WORK."
4,I mostly loved it,I really thought the story was great. Good explanations of religions. But a couple of scenes were too over the top and I truly disliked the ending. It was like it stopped and I wanted more.
4,A Good Read,I enjoyed this book very much. Small wonder it was made into a movie. Mr. Martel skillfully weaves his tale; his description of the main character's life as a boy made me see the world from the character's eyes. I will recommend this book to my friends.
4,Great story!,"My 18 year old son read this before I did and really liked it. When the movie came out, I thought we might go see it so I decided to read the book first. I thought it was a great book. The story is compelling and very thought-provoking."
5,Amazing,Read the book when I heard the movie was coming out. Absolutely phenomenal and inspirational read. Such a positive read with a great ending
5,Read it!,What a great story! What would you do to survive? Very thought provoking! The suprise ending makes the tale. Read itbefore you see it!!
5,Excellent book; beautifully written,Provocative and beautiful literature. A teenager's struggle with survival and his spirituality. The descriptions of his journey are vivid and st times spell-binding. Nothing quite like it!
4,A Worthwhile Reading Adventure,"I liked this book a lot, but mostly because of Richard Parker, (the tiger). Even though he has no voice, I empathized with him the most and I was most fascinated with his motivations.I was afraid I would not finish the book at first, because of the rambling preamble, but nearing the midpoint when the ""action"" starts, I knew it was going to be ok and for once a book that started slow built and kept getting better! Pi's cerebral machinations in the beginning served as the foundation for his subsequent mental toughness.The ending I found to be satisfying and unpredictable, at least as far as Richard Parker was concerned. I was happy that the author didn't go for the cliche ""sad"" or ""happy"" ending.I normally favor horror/sci-fi/fantasy/mystery books but this was a nice break from my usual fare. I would recommend it, especially for animal lovers."
1,Diappointing,"It starts off well in the zoo, but I got completely bored with Pi falling in live with every religion he encounters.. I have put it down. a third the way through. I might go back if I get desperate."
4,Animal behaviors,Interesting animal training behaviors described and explained in an unusual story of a shipwreck ; tiger and boy survive at sea.
5,Wonderful!,"Although the start of the book is slow, the finish is magical. This story is an example of an ingenious literary technic of rendering a tale with the beginning being a story with very believeable personal opinions, social statements and views, clear incidents of early childhood family experiences, continuing cleverly into a slowly woven tale told as a seemingly nonficticious adventure. The story eventually developes further into an epic like heroic saga and more than just real dramatic account that keeps the reader guessing about whether this perhaps truly have happened.Very original, thoughtful and just a great story. It's a really enjoyable book."
4,Extraordinary story told in an excellent way,"Amazing story telling skills on display. Sometimes it reads like a travelogue, sometimes a biography and often you get feel a hollywood thriller. It is this mix that makes it so exciting that you wouldn't want to stop once you start reading. Above all, it is an inspiring story of mankinds fight for survival in extremely trying conditions.I would have given it 4.5 stars. 0.5 less because I thought the author could have concluded this otherwise classic work in a more acceptable manner. Overall, it has been a memorable experience."
4,Good! with only a few reservations,"Overall, an entertaining book. The opening character development does go on a bit too long, so if you don't get past this (as Robert Katrin didn't) you won't get much out of the book. He may be correct in that this book isn't a great example of research, but that didn't turn me off to the story.I have a bit of an aversion when I feel authors strongly superimposing their own beliefs on top of the protagonist, whether or not I happen to agree with those beliefs.Otherwise, a fun and thought provoking story--excellent twist at the end."
4,A Captivating Tale,"I thoroughly enjoyed this work, which takes us along the journey of an ordinary (albeit precocious) young man thrown into extraordinary circumstances. For those readers who may pick this up and find themselves perplexed in the first 50 or so pages: keep reading. Soon enough you will be pulled in and you will not want to put the book down. I found myself thinking about this story for weeks after I had finished reading it. The link between animal instinctual nature and one's spiritual nature was presented well within a rather simple tale. There has been much discussion about whether or not this book ""may make you believe in God"". That may be an exaggeration, but it will at least make you think about the human need and yearning for tangible answers when unbelievable things happen. This story often takes turns that are quite unbelievable - yet remains oddly palpable at the same time. That's the whole point."
2,Suprisingly Weak,"I was very suprised by how underwhelmed I was by this novel. I like books with religious or spiritual themes/motifs, and the first 20 percent of the novel was compelling. However, once the ""action"" starts, it goes downhill. The novel is more of an exercise based on the situation (not even the author's own creation).Skip this one and real something with power, like Saramango's Blindness."
5,A Marvelous Book,"This is the most original book I have read in a long while. I was absolutely transfixed with the story and with Martel's writing. I felt I had discovered a whole new world, and read and learned eagerly through the whole book. I was sorry to see it end, but the ending was both thought provoking and satisfying.As for the reviewers who quibble about whether or not the book does or does not make you believe in God, I say: Get over it. If you paid any attention at all to the pre-shipwreck part of the book, you would have understood why Pi would make that claim."
2,Mud Pi,"I kept trying to like this book - the tone and writing were often enchanting, and the premise remarkable. Ultimately, though, I found it shallow, glib and in too many instances gratuitously violent and grotesque. My final take on it, was, So What? The best that I can say about it is, I listened to it in an unabridged audio version, and listening was better than giving into road rage during my often gratuitously violent and grotesque commute."
4,"Fear, ""life's only true opponent""","This is the story of Pi Patel, son of an Indian zookeeper, aspiring adept of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam, and immigrant to Canada whose journey takes a fantastic and tortuous detour when he falls victim to a shipwreck and survives 227 days aboard a small lifeboat in the Pacific with only a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker for company. It is a story of the human spirit, the will to survive and the presence of God. Martel tells it with humour and wit, brutal honesty and an economy of words that makes it impossible to put down. You will laugh, you will be terrified - you will say, ""Ah, I see!"". I recommend this book."
4,Artfully written,"I picked up this book and was immediately captured. More importantly, the story was so well drawn and constructed that the images Yann Martel conjured have stayed with me long after I closed the book (quite reluctantly, in fact). It is, as the protagonist states, a story to make you believe in God - or failing that, at least believe that the art of fine literature endures."
3,Too much,This book has so much hype around it that I was a bit concerned going in. The problem for me was too much religious talk; while I appreciate Pi's outlook on religion I personally don't like to have so much reference to God in my fiction.
2,Loved it.,Read it with my mom and also seen the movie too. I give it five stars. Great imagination and detail.
2,Eh.,"I was recommended this book by a friend. I enjoy many different types of books; however, did not care for the flow ofthis one . Portions dragged on and background was unclear, particularly in the beginning, while other sections suddenly accelerated and seemed to leave tremendous detail/explanation out. Not very descriptive writing. I struggled to maintain enough interest to force myself to complete it. The ending was odd and disjointed from the rest of the story. Overall disappointing."
3,"OK read, but expected more","I was a little let down. I guess my expectations were high due to the fact that this has been made into a movie. I've had this on my reading list for a long time, but never bought it. The movie inspired me to read it, but it was not as good as all the marketing suggests. I have not seen the movie, but the previews give away a lot of the basic plot. I guess I wanted something a bit more philosophical, and inspiring. I found the plot building at the beginning of the book a bit slow. I did finish the book, so it kept me interested in the conclusion."
3,Book before movie,"I read Life of Pi before movie. Still have not seen movie. I'm curious how they made a movie from this book, as it doesn't have a lot of substance for a movie. I'm assuming the movie will have to add a lot to make it entertaining. As a book, it was just a story. The end had no meaning for me. It didn't wrap anything up. If the movie is better, I would unfortunately have to recommend the movie over the book."
2,Sorry I took the time to read it.,"This is a fantasy that I could have done without. On the one hand there are the very realistically disgusting discriptions of gore ingested for the purpose of survival, and on the other hand fantasy flights of imagnination that do not appear possible in the fantasy settling the author attempted to create. I unforunately read the whole thing expecting a redeeming quality of some sort that never appeared for me. Perhaps others have found something I missed, but I am not inclined to back back for a second look."
2,Couldn't finish book,This book started out interesting and I thought I would love the story but I became very disinterested as the story progressed and finally put it aside for a more interesting adventure. I love animals but this book just didn't do it for me.
4,Graphic,found it very captivating and some what a little graphic but really enjoyed the book. Would recomend it for good reading.
5,Life of pi,I really love this book!!!I think that this is the best book that IHave ever read in my life!!But you do have to read the authors note first before reading the actual book!.
4,read this book in high school. reallt had me thinking,it was beautifully written and had me questioning everything. it was a colorful book and i truly enjoyed it. it made you question what if ?
4,Absorbing,IngThe interaction with the animals was exciting and the long boat journey detailed interesting sea-life The endingGave creditability to the whole story.
4,An exciting adventure story from India.,"The Life of Pi is an exciting, suspenseful adventure story about an East Indian boy alone on a raft with several zoo animals after the ship he was on sank not far from India. We learn about the nature of the animals and the courage of a teen-age boy whose father was the former zoo keeper. The book by Yann Martel was detailed and knowledgeful. The reader is part of the sea journey under days and nights of danger of weather and dangerous animals. I hope Martel will write another story soon."
5,Life of Pi,This is a beautiful story of courage and optimism in the face of tragedy. Pi is an unforgettable character that will stay with you long after finishing the book.
5,Jens Ridgebacks from Rhodesia,This is probably my favorite book. I have read many but this one by far is the best. Story of human nature and survival. The ending totally caught me off guard. It changed my mind of zoos completely. Highly recommend.
4,two thumbs up,"i would have to say i thought Life of Pi was an amazing book. The end came as a surprise to me, but a good surprise. I learned a lot from this book. It taught me that telling life stories as an adventure is always a lot more entertaining most of the time. Hearing stories that are always realistic and boring may not be as fulfilling as hearing a story with a little imagination to it. Pi's story was thrilling and can easily make one believe in God. Pi's faith throughout the novel was interesting to read about because it constantly got stronger and stronger. This story has a powerful message of faith and imagination that teaches the reader a lot!"
5,Just as expected,"No surprises, just as advertised. Nice colorfully illistrated cover over a nice hardcover. I am sure I will enjoy reading this book, before seeing the movie. I figure if ever the world should have to do without electricity, I will need a good library."
3,Life of Pi,"While I can see the immense popularity of this book, it is far from the best I have read of late. The plot often feels contrived and forced, and Martel's symbolism is far from subtle. This usually serves to bash the reader about the head with his clunky version of truth. Despite this, the book still proves to be fairly compelling, regardless of plot faults. It is worth reading, but unless you have a decidedly religious mindset, the book will have no lasting value."
3,Did I miss something?,"By browsing Amazon.com, and seeing the Reviews of Life of Pi, I quickly ordered it and eagerly awaited it's arrival. Excited when it came, I tore into it and began reading. The beginning was exciting, I thought it was richly written, and I settled in to a wonderful reading experience! Once into the book,however, I found parts to be more grotesque than necessary, it was pretty slow in parts, and I suppose I missed something because I don't agree with the other reviewers about it being so enlighteng etc. It did not appeal to me and I'm afraid I wouldn't highly recommend this book. I thought it was ok."
4,Life of PI,"Not only was the story interesting, but also the comments about animal behavior, zoos, character's religious beliefs and experiences. I liked the ending."
5,Life of Pi,A gift: but a wonderful tamale with a major twist at the end. Good reason it has become a new classic
3,From interest to anger,"This book plays on the reader's gullibility. I was willing to believe up to the man eating island. Then I just got upset. Is this book supposed to help me find God or is it supposed to prove that I am gullible enough to believe in a ""better"" story? Where do you find 16 year old boys who spend pages philosophizing on tigers while their own life is in great danger? The Boy Scout in my enjoyed the survival story of Pi, but the amazement of survival becomes overshadowed by things that don't add up. It made me lose sight of the meaning of the story. Then part 3 comes along and I am more confused about which of two unbelievable stories I am supposed to believe. It reminds me of Jesus' parables where even his direct reports couldn't understand. It leaves me asking ""Why?"". Why don't you just give me a story that clearly supports your point?"
4,Plot thickens then slows down,A great book for a teenager but reading it as an adult was disappointing. Reminds me of a book that my 4th grade teacher read to my class after lunch. I loved that story.
1,I don't understand how this book received rave reviews,"I only finished this novel because I thought it would get better. Clearly I was wrong. I found the religious aspect of the book to be quite boring and to drag on excessively. I also wondered if they would ever get off the lifeboat. I think the fact that you know from the beginning that the book is a happy ending causes the book to fail as a ""page-turner."" The book left me with such an uninterested feeling. I couldn't wait to finish it just so I could stop dragging it around with me.I would not recommend this book nor would I suggest that it should win any more awards. I gained little if anything from it."
1,ZZZzzzZZZ hugh?,"I tried to read this book two summers in a row. Too snoozy. I just couldn't get interested in the boring characters. sleep therapy, snooze, bore, bad, yucky..."
3,Great for young adults,"Great for young adults. Otherwise, too superficial and obvious. I actually taught it was entertaining, except for the irritating ""insights""."
2,A waste of time,"I read the book because the great comments that it will make you believe in God... but where was God? Only the first part says some things about religion very interesting firs chapter, but the body of the book is boring, monotonous and repetitive. It is true that it has some excitement at certain points but I was expecting a good book that will stay in my mind... but for sure it won't"
2,Not at all what I expected - difficult read (spoilers),"I felt this book was about 100 pages too long in the middle. I enjoyed the first part until they got on the boat much more than the middle. The end left me with a ""WOW"" feeling, but it wasn't worth suffering through the middle of the book.This is a ""thinking"" book and is not a light fun read. I think you have to read it twice to even get it."
4,Could not put down,If you haven't read it...get it. I found this book to be very entertaining. Also found other titles interesting:'Hemorrhage in My Head' by NMR'Three Junes'
1,"Wasted Time, Wasted Money","I bought this book based upon the rave reviews here on Amazon. I found the book to be tedious, the ""message"" to be highly derivative, and the storyline to be slow at best. I had high expectations- clearly they were MUCH to high."
1,Couldn't finish the first CD,"I could not connect with the material in this novel. It just seemed to drone on and on without ever really getting off the ground. The reading being done with an accent was also a little distracting, but made sense because of the character's point-of-view. The author loves a clever turn of phrase (which got annoying quickly). I was so bored by the novel, that I ended up getting my money back. Sorry, Yann."
3,...?...,I was told its a true story. That kind of affected the way I read it. But still enjoyed the ride.The religious undertones seem pointless...I could have done without them.I still dont believe in god. They shouldnt have put that on the cover...false advertising.The story was nice. Kinda like a long R rated fable (for Gratuitous Survival Violence)
1,I don't get it.,I read this book some time ago and prefer to forget that I spent so much time talking myself into the necessity for finishing it so that I may find the meaning of the story. Am I missing something? A couple hundred pages are spent in the life of a young boy and Bengal tiger surviving a ship wreck on a small boat. That's it folks.
1,Meaningless Twaddle,"This novel lacks a plot that is believable, or makes any kind of sense. While stranded in a lifeboat on the ocean both Pi and the tiger would have died of thirst, malnutrition, or exposure before making landfall. The author is unable to decide how the book should end so it merely tails off while Pi babbles anything that he thinks his interrogators might like to hear or might believe. In spite of the blurbs claim that the book might even make you believe in God, it completely fails to help its readers believe in the Life of Pi. If Yann Martel intended to write a book in the style of magical realism he fails at that as well. Instead of winning the Man Booker prize in 2002, no award should have been given. The novel should have been thrown in the trash, and the Booker prize spared the loss of integrity and prestige caused by giving an award to such a poorly written piece of prose. In short, there is no redeeming value to this book."
5,Good Read,I wanted a book that I could get into and enjoy reading. Pi did it for me. Right after finishing the book I saw the movie and neither were disappointing.
1,Highly Disturbing,"This is the first novel I have read in a long while that has caused in me such a strong negative reaction. It is not so much the narrative, which I found in turn tedious, preposterous and then duplicitous, but the message which was highly disturbing if not abhorrent. I am dismayed by the many positive reviews it has received.Many here have expressed their concerns and criticisms far more adroitly than I can, so I'll just point you to them with a few judicious quotes from their reviews.Shran : ""Postmodernism at its worst""WhatNow: ""This book has all the grace and purpose of a snuff film""Inquiring Mind: ""Silence of the Lambs meets Sophies Choice""(although this last places the book with company it does not deserve to keep)My own summary: gratuitous gore, tedious detail, duplicitous plot line and a philosophy that should be taken out and shot at dawn."
1,Disappointed,"I read this book based on the wonderful reviews. I really enjoyed the beginning, but I found it to be boring and unrealistic after the initial scenario of the ship sinking and Pi surviving on the lifeboat with the animals. It also grew to be disturbing, especially so at the end with the alternate explanation given for his survival. At that point, I wished I hadn't even read it and spent my time doing something else. I also have no idea why the book promises ""to make you believe in God"", probably some editor's great marketing idea. I thought it to be too graphic and gory, not to mention unbelievable. This book is not for the sensitive or faint of heart."
1,I didn't Get It,"This was a selection for my book club. I really tried to get into the story but couldn't find anything I liked about it. Supposedly, the book gets ""can't put-it-down interesting after page 93, but didn't happen for me."
2,when will it end,"This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions. But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading. It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part. Where did that even enter into the book? Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next."
1,great start,"I loved the beginning of this book. It was great. I liked the information about animals and religions. However, as soon as Pi got stranded in the ocean, this book took a nosedive. It became boring and vey gory. When I finished it, I felt an intense hatred toward the second part. I even ripped it in half and threw it out. However, the beginning was wonderful."
1,All at Sea,"I resented the time I spent reading Life Of Pi. Having just finished Atonment I was counting on the Amazon reviewers to guide me to another jewel. I read on thinking it must get better, more realistic, more intelligent, maybe even more lyrical. I fount myself skimming the pages hoping something would happen to make me care. Maybe I did miss the boat but if it was that small fleet with the tiger I am glad Istayed with my feet not my head in the sand."
1,Didn't like the book,"I understand the book but just didn't like it. The writing is good, didn't like the subject matter. Was rather long and drawn out."
3,Thriller,"This is a well written thriller, a real page turner. It is very far fetched in places and very real in others. If you like a survival story this is for you."
3,I learned much but was expecting something different,"While I enjoyed much about this book I was confused much of the time. The entire first part of the book sets up the authors knowledge of zoology which is important to the story. But, there is such a great portion setting up Pi's religious beliefs and love of God. What confused me was how this belief in a higher being played very little part in the story after the ship sinks. It was disturbing at times and humorous at times. I guess I would give it 3 1/2 stars if it was possible. Worth reading if you love animals and want to learn many interesting facts about zoo life."
5,GREAT ITEM!!!,"This book came in a very good condition, much better than described. Shipping was fast, and prices were reasonable:)I will definitely buy from this seller again!"
3,Good but not great,"The somewhat unlikely storyline is very well crafted and I found it engaging for most of the way through, although my suspension of disbelief was severely challenged when he shared his life raft with a Tiger called Richard. What spoiled it for me was the way in which the story was brought to a close, it seemed disjointed and almost rushed.I realise in saying this, I'm probably in the minority as so many people have loved this book."
3,Next Read?,"This is an improbable but enjoyable tale written with a style that is sometimes, but not always, totally engaging.What is immensely enjoyable is the sardonic relationship between a small boy cast adrift on a life boat with only a grumpy Bengal Tiger for company. Yann Martel's ability to carry this allegorical 'dialogue' for the best part of the book is simply outstanding.I enjoyed Life of Pi and I'm very pleased I read it but am a little surprised at the praise bestowed by so many. Don't let that put you off for a moment though - I do seem to be in the minority with this view as most reviewers rave about it.What to read next, well if I wished to 'keep the mood' this book left with me it would have to beThe Kite Runner."
2,missing chapters,Boring... most of the time it is very slow... and missing a 2 chapters in the book did not help... defected book and the story was not worth me to go true the hassle returning and waiting for the new one.
5,Brilliant,"A miraculous tale told expertly. I enjoyed the story immensely from the ponderings of religion, to the survival at sea, and then the psychological twist at the end interspersed with much wisdom and humor."
4,This book messed with my mind.,The book really draws you in and I don't want this to be a spoiler alert but when you finish and realize what the book was really about--you will think about it for days.
5,A book that everyone should read,"(I need to be a bit vague in this review to not give too much away. I apologize.)On the surface, Life of Pi, is a well written, entertaining, but casual story about Pi's (the main character) adventures. It wasn't until I began discussing the book with my daughter, who also read it, that I realize there was something more to it. My daughter and I had a pretty strenuous disagreement about what the book was about. So I began doing some research and discovered that the author intentionally wrote the book to be interpreted in two different ways. The way each of us interprets the story is a reflection of how we look at certain aspects of life.The story is fun. The reflection and self-discovery after the reading is where the real pay-off occurs.""And so it goes with God"""
3,Wondering,"I don't know that I saw such symbolism in this story as other online reviewers here saw. I felt for one that that Pi's religious leaning never materialized much in the main meat of the story, when he was lost at sea. I was expecting more of an enlightenment to come during his time with Richard Parker, instead it remained to me a basic castaway story, with the routine ""Oh God, why have you done this to me""'s scattered about. And the ending was the oddest I think I have ever read, making me wonder which was the real story? Could the truth have been the tale of murder and brutality that he told the investigators in the end, when they found his tale of being abandoned in a lifeboat with a tiger too farfetched? Could the main story of the book been all mere symbolism for horrors that Pi could not face and understand? I think the heart of the story was really a wonderful tale, but to me there were parts that seemed mismatched and disjointed."
4,Imaginative and inspirational,"I spent the whole Saturday chasing the audacious journey of Pi on Pacific Ocean... deeply touched and captivated... it's not about God and I am not a believer, but you would wonder his power behind our existence, or more exactly our own strength through faith... you would wonder the non-randomness of absolute universe... I am very much amazed by author's imagination, by his superb skill of story-telling; beneath this adventurous story lies subtly the more philosophical and spiritual rhythm... it's not a must-read book, but once you go through the journey with Pi, the cinematic view and mesmerized notion would forever stay in your mind..."
5,Beyond Expectations,"If something inexplicable has lured you to this book, purchase it immediately. If someone suggested that you explore it, please do. It speaks to the heart and soul with striking depth, yet it provides much laughter. A beautiful story that doesn't hide behind anything."
3,Good......But......,"This book was good and unlike anything I have ever read, but probably would have been better had I read it with a book club as there are so many themes within the story that would lead to much spirited discussion. Let me say that this author is so talented, his writing style is fluid and easy to fall into even in the beginning before Pi left Pondicherry, India and the topic of zoology dominated the pages. I love Pi Patel. His character is as real as any you'd meet on the street. It is he and Richard Parker that I will remember from this reading experience."
4,Life of Pi A book worth reading.the propmos for the movie wer,The propmo for the movie was the reason for me reading the book. The story kept me intrigued for most of the book and i only fast forwarded a couple of times. The ending was thought provoking as it left you wondering which story was the real one. I wonder how well the book will transfer to film which appears to be rated as a family movie as portions of the story in the book are quite horrific.
5,What a story of survival,"The beginning was a bit dry, but once the ship wrecked the book was an exciting, unbelievable account of survival. I now want to see the movie."
1,More info and additional photos would be nice....,"I agree, I wouldn't purchase this bag due to the very limited description. Interior photos of the bag would be helpful as well."
5,A great purse at a great price,The customer reviews helped me decide to purchase this. It is much better than the Stone Mountain purse that I paid over twice as much for. It also has pockets inside for a cell phone.
1,not better than the original,"I always wanted to listen to a tribute album for Yngwie as I wondered what others would sound playing his songs. Bottom line is, Yngwie's music can only be played by Yngwie. You can only laugh as these wanna be guitar players stumble through Yngwie's fast pace. It sounds like guitar students trying to play Malmsteen 101. The last song is actually good as it sounds like what Steve Vai would sound playing an Yngwie tune."
2,Avoid at all costs!!!,"Boy, is this CD bad. from what i can gather from my little experience as a musician, any classical music is comprised of Virtuosity (rd:speed) and feel. Yngwie, undoubtedly, is a master of both. these wannabe punks on the other hand have destroyted the whole feel factor and their playing is very sloppy too. another thing, the covers here are played EXACTLY NOTE BY BOTE as done by yngwie, no creativity whatsoever.I've given it 2 starts just becasue of Eklundh's original Yngwie 2000 (last track). Eklundh, in my humble opinion, is European answer to Steve Vai. BRILLIANT GUITARIST, and certainly the only saving grace of the entire album. his use of harmonics is just KILLLEEERRRR!!Moral - download yngwie 2000 from somewhere and avoid the rest of the album at all cost"
1,Buy the originals instead people,"Yngwie has given us some great tunes over the years and a few good quotes as well. Alas most of the bands on this disc are unlikely to do the same.Most of the tunes just wander aimlessly and really and fail in the two most important areas of tribute albums. Firstly they don't allow you to get a different take on the Yngwie stuff and secondly your not inspired to get your hands on stuff by the band doing the cover tune. Some of the bands sound like they may be alright, perhaps they are just on the wrong tribute CD.My personal exception to this is the Chris Amott version of Big Foot, which is track 1. That did make me want to check out some more of what that guy has done.I wanted to like this album due to my respect for Yngwies work and my enjoyment of discovering new bands. But this doesn't do much for anyone."
4,Entertaining Read,"Although not great literature, Daughter of Prophecy is an entertaining read for all you Christian fantasy fans! I hope Mr. Owens gets the second book done quickly!"
4,A well done debut novel & series start...,"I went into this book expecting more of an action/adventure tale, when in fact, while there is a good helping of well written action, it is much more focused on the internal struggles of the characters as they seek to overcome their past and accept their place in the Eternal's plan. As such you will spend a lot of time in more mundane settings, experiencing the internal turmoil.As such, the book dragged a bit for me, especially 1/2 way through in a lenghty span covering the events of an important, but often tedius wool sale.Still, the characters are likeable, and the events believable within the world. Overall I enjoyed this initial offering by Miles Owen, and look forward to continuing the series as Rhiannon grows in her role as Protectoress of the Covenant."
4,"Huston Smith, Wherever You Are~","I read the book a year ago. There is one short passage in the book -- which I have now given away -- which states (and I paraphrase): ""A child drops an ice cream cone. The child thinks its the end of the world but the mother knows that it is not. Perhaps there is an intelligence so staggering in its capacity that to it gulags and archepalagos are like dropped ice cream cones."" The book was worth that one passage. You gave me back my faith and gave me some hope and peace. And for that I, who started reading you as a college Freshman over 40 years ago, will always be profoundly grateful. Thank you."
3,worht the work of getting through part one,"Like others, I had *big* problems with the first part of the book, a very ""rambling and self-absorbed polemic."" I nearly just stopped reading. The first part, where he describes scientism's tunnel, is so disjointed and ill-argued, that you are frustrated. Then you get to part 2.I think Hustom Smith only really put his heart into part two, becuase that is where he is eloquent and easy to follow, and has a very good style. He also drops a pretensse of trying to convince you of anything, he realy approaches it as ""here is what I believe and why"". The closing puts a spin on a worldview and concept of spiritualy I had never encountered before, and it profoundly is changing how I think about things. I'm still absorbing it, but like my review title, I wanted to let you know its worth slogging through the first part to get to the genuine second. Or maybe jsut skip to part two <g>."
4,"You tell them , Huston!","Why Religion Matters: The Fate of the Human Spirit in an Age of Disbelief by Huston Smith is just a great book. Yes modern man has big trouble accepting some of the ""antiquated"" ideas of traditional religion. But just where is all this `new age' thinking taking people anyway, certainly not toward God. I hope Huston Smith reins those people back in with his book.I see from"
1,Get to the point,"Smith can spend an entire chapter dancing around a subject without getting to the point.Just say it don't spend ten pages talking about how you wanted to find a story that would help explain your point it but you couldn't.How did this get good reviews, holy crap."
1,Great disappointment ...,"I approached the book agreeing with the thesis and looking for insights. Unfortunately the discussion wanders all over the place and after about 50 pages I just gave up. His points could have been better made in just 5 pages. This work is definitely orders of magnitude below his seminal ""The World's Religions"" which I am beginning to read a second time."
2,But does religion have any validity?,"Huston Smith tells us ""why religion matters."" He gives apologetics for faith that he never tries to prove or demonstrate. He judges religion by scaring the reading about what life would be like without religion. This is an old technique but it does not convince anyone who has brains."
3,Two Books in One,"This book is divided into parts one and two. Part one insightfully reminds us of the inadequacy of ""science"" to answer ultimate questions about the human condition. I give part one a 5 rating. Part two however, is largely an academic apology and disappoints. I give part two a 1 rating."
2,Heavy Sledding and a Misleading Title,"I started this book with high hopes found this to be a rambling and self-absorbed polemic. I'm not sure that the title accurately represents the gist of the book, which seems to be a one-sided debate with the scientific world view. Smith constantly tells us where he is going, what he is doing next -- like the reader is interested in the mechanics of how he constructs his argument. At the end, I felt a victim of ""bait and switch,"" expecting further thought on the importance of religion in our life as opposed to an intellectual artillery barange on the modern scientific approach. This was a disappointment and I felt somewhat mis-led."
3,Smith is excellent when describing; less so when polemical.,"I am indebted to Smith. Many of his books have been an important resources on world religions and related topics. This book, while raising many important issues, is less satisfying for a variety of reasons. For a different approach to the significance of religious belief see my ""Morality: Does 'God' Make A Difference?"" I leave open the question of whether or not God exists; but I do show how belief in God can make a difference--for good or ill."
3,Science Matters,"The book is at it's best when it envisions a future in which religion and science can coexist in a beneficial fashion. Unfortunately much of the book reflects on the past, with long tirades about the dangers of science and ""scientism"" in western culture. It harkens back to a lost pre-technological golden age, when we had time for wise meditations.So much is dedicated to this theme that the title could have been ""Why Science Matters"", as if religion can't stand on it's own two feet without this negative phantom reflected in the mirror. Mr. Smith can be brilliant or curmudgeonly depending on his mood, and at times his science is a little weak."
2,Author display *his* bias,"Huston Smith has the credentials to write of religion and this is the strongest aspect of this book. Early on he tries to make the distinction between science and scientism, but he shows his own bias by insisting on arbitrary limitations on science itself. He is clearly personally bothered by the theory of evolution and spouts standard pseudo-science arguments that are just plain wrong. His insights into similarities of all religions are interesting, but the degree to which such broad generalizations are true is debateable."
5,The cd you take with you to a desert island...,"If you can have but one blues cd...make it this one. Etta is at her very best in these recordings and brings a sweaty, kettle-about-to-boil-over passion reminiscent of Big Maybelle's Okey Sessions to these blues standards.The greats of the past must be smiling down from blues heaven on this disc...it is perfection!"
5,Nice piece of software,"I'm not an audio expert by any means, but Sound Forge impressed me with its power and simplicity. I needed to clean up and edit a few audio tracks for use in Flash, and Sound Forge did the job no problem. I was able to cut and paste parts of my tracks, adjust output levels, and save them so that they were ready for my other application. There are plenty of other features that I didn't try out (e.g. special effects and various tools to improve the quality of your tracks).I'm using the 30 day free trial version (which is full-featured but time-limited), but when I'm ready to buy, this will be the one."
5,so much better than using microsoft,i bought this product being i hate using cheap microsoft 192 encoding for my mp3s. this product allows you to encode high quality and its easy to use. alot of options that i will never even use for editing as well.
3,Sony Recording System,"I am disappointed with this software. I purchased this software to be able to record songs that I play on a keyboard to a CD. The software does that; however, I cannot hear what I play as it is recording. This makes it difficult for me to keep tempo, play the notes correctly, etc. Additionally, I am disappointed with the instruction manual. It is very vague. Sony offers a technical assistance plan, which, of course, has to be purchased. I would not recommend this product for the average computer user."
4,Vinyl LPs to CD,Audio Studio works fine to transfer LPs to CD. It is easy to reduce pops and clicks. It does not take all of them out automatically but if you spend enough time you can take out the ones it misses. It has a lot of other features that I don't use.
5,No glitz and glamma...this is stright out of the golden age.,"Having grown up in the late 80's and early 90's when hip hop & rap were simple and not all about the bling bling bull, this album is a god send. This album is from a time when we watched YO! MTV Raps, rocked the trench Goose and copped the newest tape. As soon as I popped this album in I knew it was sick. If you love hip hop and long for the beats and rhymes you grew up with....BUY THIS."
5,A Talented Duo!,"This right here is a taste from the golden era. I've been listening to Charizma & Peanut Butter Wolf for a long time. Charizma is one of those emcees that don't need to sound tough or even cuss. That just tells you he's a skilled emcee. These guys are probably one of the best MC/DJ combos I ever known digging through. I would appreciate it if PBW added ""High School Love"" on the album though.""I left my rhymes in a shoeboxA week later I opened, it was Timberlands""-My World Premiere"
5,Great CD,"Should have had promotion and been released a lot earlier in memory of the late rapper, great cd, got that ol' school rap feel"
1,Mad I Copped,Old B.S.Sounds like Kris Kross with the backward clothes from the early 90's. Old garbage that you really don't want to hear. Should give it 0 stars
3,pretty good,"Mary popins on steroids , musical wonder with a twist of magic mushroom dust , I never felt thus way before or since ....pure fun and exactly what I expected ."
4,tuckerized,"once again,the boys come through.except for the goofy blue jean photo,this is a good one for mtb fans.you can't go wrong with ""anyway the wind blows rider"" and ""reachin for a little bit more"".sittin on the back deck of your country home with your favorite cold drink and this cd is a perfect way to relax."
4,Do it youself mudflap,"These mudflaps are really just two pcs. of plastic. They are the perfect size and shape for many smaller cars. You will have to do some drilling and pre-fitting to make sure that look good on your car. If your a ""do it your selfer"" they are worth the money savings. If you are not, you would be better off with something more custom for your model car. These are universal mudflaps."
4,Great for the price,"These mud flaps do what they're supposed to. It is made of molded plastic and is a tad bit flexible. For the price, one really can't go wrong. I used these to replace the stock mud flaps on a Subaru. Be advised that you must drill you own holes and possibly supply your own mounting hardware."
2,Poor Quality on the Glaze,"I have almost a complete set of dishware and bakeware in the Sango Blue. The items I received over a year ago were all of good quality and arrived in good condition. Sadly, there have been quality and breakage issues with my latest purchases. My casserole dish and lid arrived in one piece, but the lid has several obvious flaws in the glaze on the lid and so is not aesthetically pleasing. I have yet to try baking with it to see how it holds up to heat."
4,Very Nice,"This casserole matches perfectly with the nova blue plates (of course) and makes a great serving dish. I would be far too scared to actually bake food in it, so I stick to just serving. The lid fits perfectly, and I don't know if it's because it is supposedly hand-made or painted or whatever, but the marking on the bottom where it is supposed to say the brand is fuzzy and illegible. But who's looking down there anyway?"
1,broken,This arrived with one of the handles on the cover broken -- I was very disappointed as it would have fit in great with my kitchen decor. Very sad it had to be sent back.
5,Off tha Hook!!,This Album is Just a Single i've Been listneing to No means No for the past 6 Months... still not fed up of it. I only herd 3 songs coming From ricky and all 3 are HOT!! Whens the Entire album Droppin !?!
3,"Great fun, but didn't last long.","I bought this for my two sons, ages six and four. It ""endured"" an afternoon of rough play (punching, kicking, jumping on) before we discovered a hole in the seam on the bottom. If your kids are rough (like mine), a more durable choice would be a better option, but they loved it while it lasted! =)"
2,great idea NOT durable,my two and a half year old loves this!! problem being that after a couple weeks....the seem started leaking the water out. no longer usable. I am trying to think of a way to make a good repair...but am not sure. NOT durable at all!!
1,Lasted 2 hours!,My son who is 4 got this for his birthday. My daughter who is 6 was also playing with it. They were have loads of fun until the bop bag would not pop back up. We took a look at it and found a small hole in the seem. I kid you not it lasted only 2 hours.
5,Can't be without this in car!,"I love this travel changing pad. I keep it in the door of our minivan. I have two girls under 2, so I'm constantly changing diapers when we're out and about. I'd much rather change them in the car than public bathrooms on those germy changing tables. There is a ""wedge"" that you can adjust with velco - it allows you to have a flat surface to change the baby on without him/her rolling toward the crease in the seatback. Plus, it is very easily wiped off. Target stopped carrying this for some reason and Walmart doesn't have it...I'd buy all my pregnant friends this online!! This truly is one of those ""must haves""!!!"
5,Really convenient,"I use this in my diaper bag instead of the change pad that the bag came with. The pockets are stocked with wipes and diapers, so when I need to change my baby, I only have to grab this out of my diaper bag instead of taking the whole bag and taking out the change pad, diaper, wipes, rash cream, etc one by one. After baby is changed, I can hold him and use my other hand to fold this away.I love it"
2,Review on A Very Special Movie,This movie has been censored. A lot of scenes have been cut off. It's a shame as the original movie had more complete scenes. I am very disappointed.
5,Guyana:Jane Engage (Folk Songs Of Guyana,"This recording transcends race in Guyana and brings back the taste of our multi-ethnic food, the fresh, enhanting smell of our natural wonderland and the stories of our six-plus beautiful peoples, told to us via this beautiful recording in Guyanese African Culture. The songs are familiar and moves you to heights you had only known in your own country! A Must-Have for every single race of Guyana and others! I love it!"
2,Diabetic Bracelet,"It serves the purpose, but it seemed to me that the image was a lot prettier and sparklier than it turned out to be. I wear it more than the necklace since it does not look as bad with my clothing."
2,Impossible clasp makes this unwearable,"The clasp on the bracelet is not as shown in the photo. It's a vaguely complicated clasp that is difficult to open in general and is also very stiff - I had to get two pair of pliers to pull it open. If I was to put the bracelet on and close this clasp, there's no possible way I could get it off again without using wire cutters to cut the chain. (Because of course one hand would be WEARING the bracelet and thus not free to use tools to pry the clasp open with.) As it happens I make jewelry so I have other clasps around and the tools to remove and replace the existing clasp, but I doubt this is true of most people, so I would have to describe this bracelet as unwearable for the average customer.It comes with a nice wallet card, which frankly I think is worth the small purchase price, and is why I gave this item two stars instead of one."
2,not pleased,"I had ordered a ""Type 1"" Diabetic bracelet and received a ""Type 2"" instead. i ended up writing in a red Sharpie ""Type 1"" on the front, then placed tape over it, so it wouldn't rub off. I don't like the style, it is ugly but I am tolerating it. The clasp is a pain in the...(something that rhymes with ""clasp"") and I have perfect dexterity."
4,Buy!mustbuy!mustbuy!!!,"this cd starts out a little slow, the first track drags on along with track 3, otherwise a flawless ceedee. original tracks from depth charge, and aphrodite kicks booty. along with Chemical Bro remixes it is definitely worth checkin out. I just wish some of these dern ceedee stores online carried more stuff from those rockin freakniks!"
2,Remote,Key shop could not make it work on this jeep. This jeep does have remote option according to the build certification.
1,Incorrect shoes,The options to choose the shoe colors are incorrect. When choosing the picture for the patent leather it is actually the regular Black PU. I ordered them for my daughter and they are not the correct shoes. I went off the picture when choosing the shoes unaware that they had a different description. The shoes themselves are fabulous just not what I wanted. I am going to wait to see if she loves these one as much as the patent before I decide if i need to send them back. I just thought you should be aware.
4,Superb Blues Harmonica,Little Walter stands out for the tone and the range of his harmonica playing. Little Walter plays the harmonica with a flourish only matched by Shakey Horton and Sonny Boy Williamson. Little Walter takes the sound of this cheap instrument to another plane.
2,Not a great puzzle,The pieces of this puzzle are all warped and twisted and so don't fit together well. Very disappointing and frustrating.
1,pieces do not stay together,"This, like the other Geo Puzzle puzzles, is a great idea that has been poorly executed. The pieces do not stay together--if you touch the puzzle while putting in a piece, the other pieces will come apart. This is frustrating for adults and children!Very educational, but frustrating to use."
3,"ok, but try adding bread flour to recipe","I have had this book for several years and used it often. Recipes are ok, but never really great either in terms of flavor, texture, or crunch. Adding 1/2 to 3/4 bread flour to recipes helps. BTW, better biscotti recipes in Anthony Parkinson's wonderful little book, ""Italian Desserts""Italian Desserts-- These are also 'low fat' no butter. For Parkinson's recipies, I also substitute bread flour for 1/2 to 3/4 c. of the total flour as well. Something to do with protein content and structure of final product."
4,Excellent variety of Biscotti recipes,We love biscotti and this little cookbook has a wonderful selection of low fat recipes. Each recipe I've tried has been a hit. The only thing that would improve the book would be a wire binding!
1,not worth $1.00,this knife sucks. the creators of this knife are very cheap. they didn't even use good quality plastic inserts for the dragon. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! the metal is very cheap and impossible to sharpen.
5,Entheogens: Professional Listing,"""One Nation Under God"" has been selected for listing in ""Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy"" http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy"
2,"Mancina, but not at his top form","I've been a long time fan of Marc Mancina. His amazing and high energy score from Bad Boys and his sweeping score for Twister. Since imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, his great riffs for Money Train were apparently borrowed by Hans Zimmer for ""The Rock"" score. But the SHOOTER score could have been written by at least half a dozen other lesser composers. It's very atmospheric, but missing the signature (and memorable) themes of a typical Mancina Score. Apparently it's Mancina on autopilot, and I found this a bit disappointing. I listened to the score three times and a few hours later, I couldn't remember any particular themes. Some good solid atmospheric elements, but not a slam bang score in my book."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"First half of Greek mythology reference and stories.A swashbuckling adventure story writer Graves most certainly wasn't, but that didn't stop me reading this many times. Of course, in a more reference oriented version as this there are many, many notes etc. to let you delve into this as deeply as you like.4 out of 5"
5,this is pac,"Ok now.. if this aint pac then why is his face hidden and his whole body, hiding certain ""tattoos"" on the cover of his album? Why would this guy need to hide his face? Not to mention he sounds alot like pac."
3,Chris' review,Blac Haze is a very talented rap star with the same credentials as 2 pac (probably cause he is) he sound too much like him & his debut single cover adds more contriversy with a long jacket covering any tatoos. no face showing and a graveyard. but anyway his music has catchy beats and overall is a great purchase just not top of the list. if your a 2 pac fan you need this CD. black hase you aint foolin anybody
1,not impressed,"the IR285A-6 was a good tool, the IR285B-6 is now made in China and the durability is poor."
5,amazingly hilarious!!!,I saw this special on comedy central with one of my friends and we could not stop laughing!I would definitly reccomend if you need a good laugh *not for young kids*
5,Funny,Donald Glover is funny. I'm not sure that you can ask for much for out of a stand up special..
5,funny,Donald Glover is so entertaining. Everything he does is gold! This comedy special is everything I was hoping it would be.
1,Labeled wrong,Form W-2 label says 2010... the product has a big 2011 clearly visible through the wrapper.....I was shipped the wrong year 3 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Fast but has problems,"I've owned this sander for several years. The dust collection tube worked at first but then wouldn't stay on. Now the off/on switch broke. Too bad. This is a fast, smooth sander with problems."
2,Once - Twice - Enough!,"Because of special needs, I have purchased this sander new and found the initial usage quite satisfactory. The plastic gears wear quickly and after a few dozen hours the sander becomes loud and soon strips the gears. Ordering new gears and changing them is difficult, time consuming and expensive. Be careful of the brush wires they catch and break easily, you may even find it cheaper to buy a new sander - oops another $70-$90! Yes it may be a toss up. Sorry to say I've purchased Porter-Cable 9444 twice because I have not found another sander to fit the areas I need to sand. Yes, I have learned and since the second unit has failed for the same reason the first one did - no more Porter Cable 9444's. Reconditioned units must have new gears."
3,Just wood,"This book gives a nice overview on some basic principles of wood, such as its properties, methods of producing lumber, and tips on selecting the right kind of lumber for your needs. I found it to be interesting & informative. Personally, I found the entire section dedicated to veneers & manufactured boards a bit much, but if this interests you, it is probably a good source.The most useful aspect is the wood directory, a comprehensive guide to 78 types (ok, it could probably have included more) of wood available commercially in N. America. Complete w/ accurate color photos, it offers descriptions, uses, properties, & even whether the wood is endangered or rare.Don't expect to find any sort of project or tool tips here - you won't find any. But for a good, complete guide to all things wood, look no further."
4,Very nice,"Really soft leather so very comfortable after a long day at work, great fit. Wish the laces were less 'slippery' but that seems to be the problem with all shoes these days. KC often creates shoes with very interesting soles compared to other manufacturers, so I rate the styling of the sole on this good, not outstanding. Definitely recommmend."
5,Very readable.,"I was developing Java apps for i-mode phones in under 4 hours. That was after reading 2 chapters. The rest of the book was a bonus read. The text is a bit outdated w.r.t. European WAP phones, he doesn't seem to realise we have long battery lifes too, WAP on gprs to boot! That's not going to stop me giving it 5 stars. One of the downloads you really need is no longer at the link published in the book. I sent an e-mail to the author late one night pointing this out. When I woke and checked my mail he had answered and I could get what I needed.This book was worth it as a ""get started with i-mode development"" and was interesting as a ""how they made wireless internet economically viable""."
5,Tuba like you've never heard!,"This album is a great piece of soloistic instrumental playing, nevermind that it is on the tuba! My old review was 4 stars, but after hearing Oystein again live and relistening to the album I did a new review with 5 stars. Oystein Baadsvik shows great musicianship and versatility on this CD. The selections range from extreme virtuosity and technical facility to lush melodic lyricism. The fact that he is backed by a string orchestra on many pieces may well further place this project in the ""landmark"" category. I may find Oystein's vibrato a hair fast at times but, my personal preferences aside, he is an incredible musician as demonstrated in ""Tuba Carnival."" Anyone looking for a fantastic solo tuba album will not be disappointed."
5,Gundam Wing Endless Waltz Soundtrack-Absolutely Tremendous,"I haven't run across many good anime soundtracks in the last couple years, but this is definitely one you should check into. If your a fan of J-pop music, you should DEFINITELY check into the soundtrack. I'm a J-pop fan myself, and I haven't run across any J-pop song like White Reflection, ever. The song was sweeeeeet. So, unless you hate Japanese music with a passion, get this CD!!!!!Sayonara, ""Noodle"""
4,Too much sugar??,"I am used to buying canned veggies that have been cooked to a mush, with too much salt. Why blueberries cooked down with too much sugar?? Isn't it possible to cook them less, and leave out most of the sugar? However, it's nice to have a can or two handy for desserts. I now have been buying frozen vegetables and frozen berries under the ""Surefine"" brand at my local IGA market. It's a great difference in taste and texture. BL"
1,dented cans,"My order of Oregon Fruit Co. blueberries arrived in a perfect box but 6 of the 8 cans are dented,3 quite seriously and 3 not as seriously.This is a product that I really want butI never buy a can that is dented!What can I do now???And now I also see that it is not a returnable item!Oregon Fruit Blueberries in Light Syrup, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)"
4,Excellent value,"We're not chefs, and are certainly no connoiseurs of fine cutlery, but this seems like a perfectly good set for a very reasonable price. They feel substantial and well balanced in your hands, they work well, and are well made. They sport a full tang and should hold up well. The look is subtle and classic. Not sure what more I could expect from a basic set of knives."
1,Chicago Cutlery Classic Chef prep knife set .,"These knives were a real disappointment ...I was really hoping they would be of good quality. I was very disatisfied with their performance...the large Knife would not even cut through a half a head of cabbage and what part it did cut went to a slant because the knife was not sharp enough to cut straight through ...the small paring knife does ok for things that arent too thick or hard but really If I knew then , what I know now , I would not have ordered them... so hopefully this review will help someone else not to make this purchase and waste their money ."
2,Got Raw Milk ?,"He is correct with respect to pasteurized milk but I had severe allergies to soy (heated, acid washed, etc) - its processed just as much as pasteurized milk. I found a happy medium by drinking raw milk. Raw milk relieved my hypertension, insomnia and allergies to pasteurized dairy. If only he had done research on raw milk. Most people though who write these kind of books only look at academics and not the clinical experiences of raw milk drinkers. With Modern milking techniques, raw milk is safe and has been a valid nutrient for centuries."
1,Non-Science Fiction or Paper Tripe?,"In following the conversation regarding this book, I find it surprisingly unnatural that belief in such a plethora of unsubstantiated facts exists. As far as the events within dairy industry, I have grown up on a dairy farm and can draw little similarity between the one portrayed here and the one which I have worked in, and seen attacked and decimated since the heyday of Ronald Reagan. As far as medical proof goes, I have been drinking milk for 23 years now, and my growth has been stunted to a mere six feet three (healthy) inches. Despite my hearty disagreement to the unsubstantiated nature of this book, I do not feel offended by its contents; rather, I am preplexed how human nature always finds a way to eventually trod on all the things that have not yet been bashed..."
5,Compelling and comprehensive review of a national concern.,"The author has passionately described in great detail the thing that most people do not want to hear. Cohen is attacking the the first cousin of apple pie, Mom, and the flag - milk. We all have drank it for years and most don't want to think about giving it up. However, if Mr. Cohen is correct (and I believe he is), you have a responsibilty to yourself and your family to test it out. Mr. Cohen is fighting an uphill battle, but I believe he is causing a groud swell of the population that is taking health into their own hands. The Wall Street Journal's (Aug 3) front page talked about the surge of non dairy milks (soy) and it's continued growing popularity. Read Mr. Cohen's book (stay with it, it isn't easy reading) and you will become convicted to research this topic even further. sjc"
2,Milk and SoyMilk are Both Deadly Poisons,"This is for those 5 star reviewers. REALITY CHECK. Commercial milk is unhealthy but so is soymilk and the same companies sell both. Yup, shocking but true. Dean Foods owns Silk brand, etc, etc. The proper sequel to this book would be ""SoyMilk: The Deadly Poison."" Unfortunately Robert Cohen never wrote it but fortunately someone else finallly did. The book is called ""The Whole Soy Story"" and its by a doctor named Kaayla Daniels. Where I live, we have lots of families who hurt their children because Cohen convinced them that milk was deadly poison and that soymilk was healthy. Both are deadly poisons."
5,To late?,"My oldest daughter, (20 years), has developed breast cancer in both breasts. Some years ago we went to a low meat diet. However, dairy products became a large part of our diet. She ran cross-country and had difficulty with mucus in her throat and other hints of problems to come. In doing research on this cancer I was shown this book by a friend. It has helped her change her diet to fight the cancer and I have also changed the diet for myself and youngest daughter. I wish I had seen this research years ago."
5,the book confirmed my own suspicions about dairy products.,"Robert's book was well written,easy to understand and well researched.I thoroughly enjoyed reading his book and couldn't put it down until I was finished with it.However, I think there is an error on page 271, midway down, the 3rd paragraph,where he discusses""protein stuff"". My wife spotted this book in a bookstore and thought I might like to read it.She was correct.Up to this point, my concerns were unfounded, until I read this book and verified my feelings were ligitimate.It was refreshing to see the truth for a change,because I don't feel I can rely on the news media. Thanks again for a great book on this topic."
4,Milk is yet another over processed anti-nutrient,"Cohen's book exposes the lie that milk is good for us. It's not good for any of us, and for some of us it's terrible!Beware, though, of thinking soya milk is a good replacement. Soya is more indegestible than milk."
3,American investigation into milk industry,A very detailed book looking at the milk industry and discussing possible adverse effects of dairy products. Emphasis on the political drama unfolding when the industry perceives a threat to its lucrative business. I found it too detailed and got bored with all the tooing and froing between both parties. I suppose it is a point that has to be made underlining how much the dairy industry is worth and repercussions should dairy be found conclusively to be linked with hormonal cancers.
3,I gave it a Three Star,"Not Canadian relatedWhy do I have to type a journal for this?They always ask for a review, after you just receive it!!!"
3,The Mad room,This is agood movie. It one of these movies that creeps up on you while watching it. The best scence in the movie is were the dog is walking around with the cut off hand in his mouth and stella Stevens see it thru the window and her eyes take on intense stare.
1,Poor quality for Chicago Cutlery,"I purchased the knife based upon the reputation of Chicago Cutlery products, was very disappointed when the knife arrived, it was chipped and has since started to rust on various sections of the blade."
4,A good tool,"I find this knife to be very useful on a daily basis. It's not the same shape as a traditional Japanese Santoku Knife, but it does what it's supposed to do.I do suggest to follow the care guidelines, washing it by hand with a soaped cloth, shapring it every few uses, and so on. I also keep my knife stored in a leather case to keep the blade from being damaged."
1,Great knife if you want a dull one,"I had high hopes when I bought it. After cutting two onions and a slice of stake, the knife is dull. I am shopping for another one now. It looks like the knife has built in child saftey features."
5,"Chicago ""Forum"" santuko knife","Very attractive appearance. Not particularly sharp right out of the box, but sharpens beautifully, and once sharpened handles/cuts almost as well as a similar knife from a top of the line name brand that cost almost six times as much on sale. Considering the price a much better value, and one does not have to be especially protective of it because it is not a major investment. I do put mine into the dishwasher with no adverse effect noticed, so long as I give it a few swipes on the sharpener every few uses."
4,Effective starter Santoku Knife,"It does what I need it to do: Chop vegetables, fruits etc. Dices well and handles well. Sharp, effective for the price."
2,Dancing with Cuba,"I too, thought this book would be a well-written account from which I could learn. While learning about Cuba during the Revolution, I was a bit bored and quite frankly annoyed by the writer's self pity and confusion. On behalf of Guillermoprieto, I will say that she does create some powerful imagery. I was sorry however, that I wasted the money on a hard cover!"
1,Selling Communism,"This book is a marketing tome for communism, a failed system. I was expecting more of a novel, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations."
2,"Not a history, but a very personal account","Guillermoprieto's memoir of the Cuban Revolution is a very personal account of one person's experience in Cuba after the revolution. She does not endeavor to provide broad background information regarding the history or politics in Cuba and is in fact quite naive and ignorant of even basic current events during the memoir. While I wasn't particularly moved by her story, her aloof and intimate account of her time in post-revolution Cuba does provide a very readable and accessable introduction to the subject."
2,Bad Start to Season 2,"This was a bad way to start Season 2. I have never liked it. It is so boring! I had to use all my attention to watch it. I used up so much energy that I had to turn it off and take a short nap before I resumed with the episode. The alien's idea of making first contact through scary gimmicks is really dumb. ""We have killed one of your people, made two zombies, and threatened you and your ship. Oh by the way, we are from another galaxy. It is nice to meet you by the way."" Very stupid!"
3,Essential Review,While listening to the CD I realized it is basically his first album 'Heartbeat' along with some new songs. I was hoping this was going to be all new music and am disappointed.
5,The Essential Don Johnson,Loved this CD and love Don Johnson. He's both a great actor and surprised me to be a great singer.
5,don johnson essentials,This music is the best around. It was hard to find a copy of his songs. But I found it and have been listening to it every minute I'm in the car.
1,Mistake,"Don Johnson has a pristine voice. This CD was a horrible combination of poorly-selected material and overproduction. It squelched every bit of sweetness out of him. If I had previewed the CD, I never would have purchased it!"
1,don johnson essential,"Its like a package of processed lunch meat, the guy has potential but the music and lyrics are prepackaged slop the only track that comes close to even being acceptable is Heart Beat."
3,A Reponse to Mr. Naples,"BTW, the book is OK at first glance.Now, on to Mr. Naples...Dude, lose the music on your site. In IE, your page doesn't display for at least 1 minute on a T1. In the meantime, we have to listen to your choice of music, which may not be everyone else's favorite. If this is the ""good use"" you are talking about in your review, I guess I won't be recommending the book."
5,love them,"awesome and fits great and came to me 2 day and i only payed for 3-5. fins them selves a sturdy and shoe pocket is great for my feet and soft, i wear 10.5 and 10 - 11 was pefect.."
4,Great Extras on DVD,The following extras are on this DVD:Hollywood Gay Pride Parade from 1971Gay In III - Griffith Park - L.A. 1971The following silent loops from the sixties-seventies:Times Square TrickDesert DudesPlayin' PoolShoot It BuddyJohnny Giant
1,The patch can't fix it!,"As a former Muslim, I see that Westernizing Islam is like putting a ""patch"" ruq3ah on a worn down outfit in the hope that it would be usable once again. Westernized Islam sounds good in theory, but theory is one thing and practical application is another. How can we overlook the spirit of Islam that is embedded in the text of the Quran that is perceived as non-negotiable by humans if Allah and His Messenger has prescribed a statute of some kind?! A Muslim can't easily chop out the ninth chapter of the Quran in order to Westernize Islam and thus come up with a dandy version of Islam. That is wishful thinking. That is why I abandoned Islam."
4,Harder than you think.,"I bought this to test my balance. Maintaining balance is a very complicated muscular control. Nothing will show you this faster than attempting a balance board. I use it for a few minutes at a time watching TV. You can feel you've worked the small muscles in your ankles/shins after you stand off the board. Your abdomen is used also. I took this to work and two male colleagues were amazed at how difficult maintaining control was. They were originally very skeptical of the use of such a device. Both said they were going to buy one to add to their training activities for sports. As I get better on the board, I will attempt to do some of the exercises in the included book (squats, lunges) that use the board. It's a cool low-tech training device."
4,going better...,"This is a step further for ""Los Mismos"" with ""growing-up-from the begining quality"". Their newest production ""Que te valla bien en todo""(2003), slowly they are gaining what slowly Marco A.S. is loosing. Still, Jose Javier Solis is still better as far as quality that M.A.S. and Los Mismos are thogether."
5,You've been mad for HOW MANY years?,"How did they do it, why did they do it, what does it mean? Who are the people behind those voices, anyway? To get the answers,watch this DVD in a quiet room; become absorbed just as you have many times while listening to DSM. Essential to any Floyd fan's collection. Will not collect dust."
3,"If you like volcanoes, read it!",I like the book because it has volcanoes in it and I like farmers and corn fields too.The book is good; it has a family and a volcano the pictures of the book are great. It is a really easy book .Thomas P. Lewis made the story real. I like the book because there are volcanoes. I think that the author wanted to tell that volcanoes are not always dangerous.
3,Love this reality story-except for the simile,"I read this book in elementary school. It really happened: the story of the volcano Paricutin. A con of the story is the simile, ""the volcano smoking like an old man smoking his pipe"" and smoking is bad for us. A better simile would have been, ""like a dragon breathing fire"" or something."
5,Handy,These wipes are very convenient to use and do a good job. Much easier than a bottle or can and a paper towel.Smell good also.
5,best wax,im happy to finf such an easey wax to work with ... cleans tar and other gard things u cant get out with any other was ....... i used it for 25 yrs ..
5,My hair can't live w/out it!,"I think Wella is phasing their ""shine polisher"" out because I have to search for it online every time I run out BUT it's the only product I will use on my hair. My hair's very curly and dry because I bleach it and this brings it right back to life. It gives it body, makes it look and feel healthy, can be used w/ air-dry or blow-dry hair and it smells really good. I hope Wella is not discontinuing this item. It's taken me 30 years to find a product that works so brilliantly with my hair!!"
4,What a Surprise!,"Cheaper by the Dozen and Bells on Their Toes have been my two favorite books since I was a little girl. But I always thought that those two books were the only two that chronicled the Gilbreth family. So I was extremely excited when I found Time Out for Happiness. Although Time Out for Happiness mostly focuses on Lillie and Frank Gilbreth, the parents, it still is completely enjoyable. Even though this book is much less focused on the humor of raising twelve children, it actually is a nice change of pace from the other two books. I enjoyed the fact that this book focused on the personal and professional partnership of Frank and Lillie that the other books only alluded to. I highly recommend this book to anyone, especially those who have followed the Gilbreth family saga."
3,"More, but less","More about the Gilbreths, but not at the level of ""Cheaper by the Dozen."" Many of the same incidents recounted, but more about their professional lives & plights, esp. the feud with Taylor over who had bragging rights to Scientific Management and the lucrative fees that went with that honor. More about their lives in Providence & Boston. Frank must have been sincere to have given up a construction business that employed 10,000 people in order to do something for those trapped by industry. Book makes Taylor seem a Social Darwinist and one of the first academic careerists to make consulting his business. A good read by a lake on a sunny day, particularly for those interested in history of Management Theory, but slower than ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" for that reason."
4,Not Sure Why the Low Rating,"Purchased this item at C. City yesterday. Charged all day. Tonight plugged in my Insignia 8 inch DVD player without its own battery. The player has been running a movie non-stop (I keep restarting it) for 5 hours. Indicator lights show 2 of 3 still lit for charge. Running this at full brightness, but no sound.I have a ""disc"" style Energizer battery as well. This is the 3 hour model. My plan for this 8 hour model is to help on a 9.5 hour flight. So far, I think this is fine.So, to close, I am not sure why this is rated so low. Rated a 4 since I have not taken the flight yet."
1,ER-DVD-MAX Battery--DO NOT BUY,We bought this battery for long flights with our children. We charged it once but didn't need it. Some time later tried to charge it and it won't charge. Piece of garbage battery.
4,Riva takes you so close to Japan you'll need a passport,"Jim Riva's book ""The Geographer"" is the hilarious tale of Winston Baldry, an Oregon State geography professor who ventures outside the comforts of his regular world for a year-long adventure as an high school teacher in Japan. Baldry finds himself in a variety of interesting situations, from a chance meeting with a Japanese mobster to a romantic affair to a chilling walk through the ruins of the Great Hanshin Earthquake. Along the way, Riva presents a Japan that you never see in Conde Nast Traveler or the Eyewitness Guides. This book is short and captivating, and laugh-out-loud funny to keep you turning the pages. You can easily read it on a flight to Narita, and when you arrive in Japan you'll feel as though you've been there before. This book is required reading for Japanese exchange students, adventurous world travelers, and anyone who wants an entertaining tale of life in Japan."
5,Very powerful.,"I am a science major and philosophy minor and I have found this book very provocative, well written and useful."
5,Jig saw,Love this saw. I have used it many times with great success and accuracy. I had to replace the cast aluminum base after I lent it to a friend and it was dropped. If you take good care of this saw it will provide many years of good cutting.
1,Awful,"This was terribly disappointing. Hardly any real pictures (mostly weird paintings, drawings, etc), which is very different from most interior design/ home decor books/ magazines. It was also very simple, a short paragraph or two per page. Felt like reading a child's book as a result. I enjoy interior design/ home decor stuff and this was boring, I skipped through some parts, couldn't stay interested. Again, photos to show what they were describing would have greatly improved the book."
1,Magellan support is non-existent,"Flimsy internal battery carrier snapped. Found one on that E site for MUCH less than Magellan would cost. Magellan support offers friendly people who want to help you, no really they do. But wanting to, and actually being able to, are entirely different things."
4,good value handheld GPS,"The Magellan eXplorist 500LE is my first GPS, before I've used only Garmin GPSs. I've decided to purchase a GPS to support my work as an RF Engineer and this GPS does it jobs well. Few things I don't like about this thing, but it's very minor. If you have this, you need to purchase the battery pack too so that you wouldn't need to open its back cover to have it powered because you'll be able to recharge the battery while it's impossible if you're using 3xAAA batteries. In overall, I'm satisfied with the Magellan eXplorist 500LE."
4,Nerdcore is Pretty Funny,"I enjoyed this documentary about the inventor of nerdcore hip-hop on his first tour. A little bit of bad language but not excessive and usually appropriate to the situation - I would let a kid 12+ watch this. If you've ever been to a Con (Comic-Con, or a Star Wars Con), you will relate. These are the people that were the A/V club in High School and spent their time playing D&D; or Magic the Gathering - now they are rapping and getting some recognition for it.Pretty funny and a good way to look into your kids' world if you are the parent of the type mentioned above."
2,Difficult to listen to,"In principal the songs on this album are a nice mixture of Arabic music for western ears, but I don't think the singer's voice is (very) good. Moreover, the average length of the songs is something like 6 minutes, which is just too long in this case. I have a lot of trouble listening to this album, or even to half of it, although I recognise that the songs are good musically. I would recommend Khaled or Natacha Atlas instead."
2,Not Great,"I'm not at all knowledgable about this type of music, but I don't like this CD much. It's doesn't seem to be purely traditional in sound, and it's not a stunning new hybrid with modern electronica. To me, the attempts to make the music sound ""modern"", mostly make it sound ""plastic"". And, as the previous reviewer noted, the man sings off key on several tunes, to no apparent effect. I was disappointed, but I'll listen to it a few more times before passing it along to someone else, or putting it in the ""resale"" pile."
1,Low quality but work,"This remote control look really cheap, the quality is really pour for the price actually $14.98."
2,Not too expensive,"I use it as an extension between the fm transmitter and the stereo in my Honda, it's ok and not too expensive. the controls are hard to use though."
2,"Thanks alot, Drive-Thru records.....","for helping to lessen yet another formerly respectable band. People, get ""This Time Next Year"" and not this. Well, get this, but make sure you don't judge the MovieLife merely on this. This is just wonderful. Who's next? More importantly, who's left?"
1,why drive-thru when you can vagrant?,movie life is not good. movie life is on drive thru. drive thru is not good. vagrant is good. buy vagrant. for good music's sake...
4,Huge improvement over what I had. Only minor problems.,"These speakers sound amazing in comparison to my PowerBook's built-in speakers, which is what I've been using, and that fills my needs. I'm no audiophile, I don't need 5.1 on my computer, all I need is decent sound for (mostly acoustic) music, DVDs, and World of Warcraft. For the price (same at Amazon as where I bought them) these sound great. Quibbles: I wish the subwoofer level were adjustable without kneeling on the floor. The three cords hardwired into the right speaker are heavy and throw off the balance so the speaker is unsteady on its stand. The speakers do not come with a Y-cable (mini-plug to RCA), even though the instructions refer to one."
3,Sound Great But....,Have the same STATIC problem...TISK TISK.Sounds great when not static-y. Think I will upgrade again.
5,PC Sound,The Model #VS2221 has an exceptional sound reproduction. I listen to the Jazz radio whenever I am within listening range. Fantastic bass and very clear upper register. I may even buy another one to bring to Brasil with me-Van Nostrand
4,Great essential cd!,"If you're a 50's R&B collector, you probably own this by now, but if you just like the song 'ain't got no home', this one is definately worth picking up. I've had my copy since the age of 14 or so and it's been played a million times! The first 3 or 4 songs have that same fun, bouncy feel. As for the rest, you'll hear a good sampling of the man's work. It may take a little to get used to the rest of the alblum, as the later material has a different sound, (mostly mellow love ballads) but altogether - not bad! If you like New Orleans sounds of Fats, Smiley Lewis, Lloyd Price or Huey ""piano"" Smith, You'll like this one."
4,Alright,It gets the job done hm you need it. But the Indian paint starts to wear after a little while. Overall a good purchase.
3,"Nice to look at, if you don't need lighting at night","We got a couple of these for Xmas to hang on our deck. The lantern itself is nice but its light output is pretty sad. It uses one AAA battery and has 2 led bulbs. After a day in the full sun (we live in San Diego) the light has a very dim glow. Dim as in - barely noticable in the dead of night. They should have been made to use a 2-3 AAA batteries and have a 3-4 bulbs. Oh well, nice decoration."
1,junki,"Like almost all solar lighting products on the market, this one fails miserably, and becomes landfill within a month. Worse, to change batteries (and replace the cheap, useless one that it comes with, you must disassemble the product. This did no good in my case, as even after replacing with a fresh battery, it failed to light. The reason, in my estimation, is that the circuitry, the ""guts"" of the light are not water tight. A little rain, a little sprinkler, a little heavy dew, and everything inside is wet. Not a good environment for electronics. Looked lovely for almost three weeks, then it died, never to run again. Save your money and the environment, do not buy these.;"
5,"Smooth, Rich, Subtle","I have been drinking Pura Vida Coffee for years! Throughly spoiled by it. I have tried nearly every blend, roast and flavor and have never been disappointed. Some flavored coffees can have an ""oily"" taste. Some you can even see the oil in your cup (eewwuu)! Pura Vida is clean and fresh, cup after cup, pot after pot. Not to mention you ""feel good"" buying it! I frequently give samplers to my coffee drinking friends and family - they LOVE seeing that Pura Vida box!To paraphrase ""Try it, you'll LOVE it!!"""
1,Cute but extremely painful,"These cut into my feet so badly the first 20 minutes I wore them that my feet literally started bleeding. Now I have ugly scars on the tops of my feet from the thin straps. Thanks, Steve Madden."
2,Steve Madden Women's Minnow Platform Sandal,"These shoes look cuter in the pictures than in person; however they are pretty comfortable for cute sandals.They run very true to size.My only complaint is the back straps are constantly falling down because they are not secured on the sides of your foot, rather they slide up and down to adjust, but never seem tight enough."
2,less than pleased,"didn't really care for this shoe...not only was it not true to size, but the straps were too loose and i couldn't fit them securely on my feet...also, they didn't look that great under jeans...i actually returned these shoes."
5,A beautiful addition to your bookshelf,"A must own book, one of the best in the 20th century. People all over the world have been emotionally moved by all 18 pages of this stunning and compelling report. If you're in the mood for a nighttime page-turner, look no further. Richard Dorrier's genius can not be measured after witnessing this book. I will say no more and let you as the reader dive into this rich summary report!"
4,I want ti buy this cd,I want to buy this cd because in the country were i live I can't find the cd in any shop were the cds are sold.
2,Not my favorite book on software testing,"I may be putting my career at risk saying this, but this book just didn't work for me. In fact none of the academic texts on ""practical"" software testing have interested me. The only book that I recommend is ""Lessons Learned in Software Testing"" by Kaner, Bach and Pettichord."
1,WIDESCREEN is not choice for viewing,"Told about this and eagerly sought out and purchased what was supposed to be the full screen version. NOT. So I went to another vendor and again received widescreen instead of full screen. I have no idea why DVDs are formatted for widescreen...everyone I know dislikes the format. Now I'm hoping to find it in VHS, which I know won't be widescreen. Any suggestions are thankfully appreciated!"
1,Disappointed,Front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced. Box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way. I replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup. The gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth.I didn't want to pay for a tuneup and hope there wouldn't be other expenses down the road to deal with so I decided to return the bike and buy something local I can get a look at before we buy.
3,Wouldnt spend money on it.,"The bike was already bent in a couple different places and scratched extremely bad before taken it out of the box. Like the other person said they wasnt any damage to the box making it appear all damages happened before it was put in the box to be shipped. Other then that it isn't to hateful, although I can tell its not going to be hard to break, because its not made to great."
1,Bad Bike Blues,"I chose this bike because of the ""customers who purchased this item..."" section. I thought that I would be getting the best deal for my money. But instead I got a really bad bike. The front tire is bent, the handle bars need to be replaced they are bent. I have to fix everything on this bike. I wish that I had read all the reviews I would not have bought this bike. I would, and I am telling anyone and everytone do not buy this bike it is not made very well!!! I will be very weary of buying anything that Amazon suggests from now on."
2,Yes AND NO!,"I agree totly with the first reviewer. Indeed Leslie is riding her brothers boat and The other one too...Arron? BUT I HAVE head Leslie sing and I think if I HAD to pick one of them as best it would be Leslie. She does have talent, something that her brothers (and most of the popular singers) dO NOT HAVE! However I thinhg that she could be using her talent in diffarent songs I mean PLEEEaseee I saw that another Carter was on the loose and I gave a grown. Some one who likes Christina Ageulera and Britiny Spears AND mandy Moore AND jessica Simson AND ..well you get my point. I say, she has talent but she wouldn't have gotten Famous if it wern't for her brothers and she should get a diffarent song writer. And that pretty much sums it up for me!"
5,Well done!,"I don't know that I can add much to what the other reviewers have said, except that the book is very very well written and even the complicated techniques appear to be easy and logical. The book has a nice flow, building up stepwise in complexity. With the codes (downloaded from the web support) to help, then you can't really go wrong."
2,Only useful if you are reading it while working at the computer,"If you are looking for a general guide to DHTML that is browser independent, this is not the book. This publication pretty much assumes everyone is running Internet Explorer and is very Microsoft-centric. Also, if you are not working at a computer with this book, you'll have a much harder time following things along. While code examples are given, there's virtually no screenshots of program output - without reading this book while working at a computer, you won't be able to learn much. This is more like a textbook that would be used in class, loaded with homework assignments you must complete on the PC before you can fully-understand what's going on."
1,Let the buyer beware Let the buyer beware,"This product was never received. The company will not reply to my questions concerning this item. To date, no refund has been received or offered. Be careful with these Vendors !"
1,Garbage In A Can,"This stuff is the absolute worst thing in the world you could do to a tire, especially one that's either flat or going flat. I've worked with tires for over 7 years and found so many people put this junk in their tire that has 3-inch gashes in the side, screws or broken bottle pieces in it, or ridden the thing flat for several miles. The crap is made from ammonia (however it's spelled) and simply doesn't work. You're basically pumping beer-foam in your tire, hoping (thinking) it'll close up any hole. But the truth is the junk just bubbles out and leaves a sticky mess everywhere. Then you take it to get fixed and it makes it such a hassle to clean out. Not that I'm supporting the dude who fixes the tire with this review, I just think the stuff is crap and would rather pump feces into the tire, or bubble gum, or oatmeal. Anything would be better than this stuff.Bottom line: get yourself some good tools to change a spare and do that instead. This stuff is a waste of money and time."
3,Not the best bike ive owned,Bike came missing the caps off the brake cables and back rim was bent.After about 4 rides the chain broke off and needs a special tool to put back on.Also the pedels feel like the wiggle when you are trying to peddle fast.Spend the cash somewhere else not on this bike
3,Money Pit,"I bought this bike thinking it would be a great entry level bike. I put the bike togther, no problems. However, the brakes would not adjust correctly. I ended up taking the bike to a Bicycle shop to get the adjustments. 73.00 dollars later after many, many adjustments the bike is usable. The bike shop said it's a very cheaply made bike but hey i paid 100 bucks for it. I wasn't expecting the Mercedes of bikes. However, unless you are certain you can do all the adjustments yourself don't buy this model. Go to a bike shop and buy a little more expensive bike and save yourself the trouble. Not to mention extra money!"
4,Great Bike Great Price,"Bought this Bike about a Year ago ,Fast Shipping and easy assembly .Great Bike for a great Price .The only Problem I had was with the Brakes .Brake Pads and Tire did not align correctly .I installed a new set of front and rear brakesProblem solved . Bike 99.- New Brakes 40.-Still a great price ."
2,very poor breaks,"I bought both the women's and men's models. The break pads refused to stop the bike even with professional adjustment. I replaced all the break pads with Shimano pads ($32.00), and lo and behold! the bikes now stop properly. The gears work fine, but the suspension on the forks is weak. If you can find a bike with Shimano parts, and a better ""name brand"" I would go for it...the Mongoose we bought at $99.00 is a much better bike without changing anything - it acutally works as it should."
3,You get what you pay for !!,"This is a Great looking bike. It arrived in only two days with the free shipping. Now for the bad. The front wheel wobbles. The front brake is garbage. I only get 12 gears instead of 18. Well, I can live with just 12 gears, it is more then enough for me. I am fairly handy and did my best in tweaking all items. The front brake is useless, so I just removed it. The fit and finish is about one can expect for a hundred dollar bike. I had to install two new inner tubes because the ones that came with the bike both blew out within the first hour of inflation. And I was quite careful with the overall inflation process. It does gets me around on short trips, and like I said, it looks great. Next time I buy a bike though, will be from a store where it is already assembled and I can check everything out before purchase. The agravation saved will be worth the extra cost."
4,Good lid with a defect,"I have a Top Fin 28 gal bow front from PetSmart. This tank was manufactered by Marineland so this is the OEM replacement lid for my tank.Pros: I've purchased 4 of these lids (including the one that came with the tank) and they have all fit just fine. I like having the clear lid for light and viewing reasons. When they are clean, they look great.Cons: The black plastic hinge will eventually break. I'm on my 3rd one and ordered a 4th as a backup because of this problem. My original lid lasted about 2-1/2 years. The second one about 1-1/2 years. I've tried to replace just the hinge but I guess I haven't been able to find the proper one. This is my biggest issue. The only other problem is the hinge isn't 100% water tight. Eventually crusty deposits will form along the hinge. Cleaning of any aquarium parts is expected though. These are fairly easy to clean with a razor blade and a paper towel.All in all, these are good replacements with the same issues as the originals..."
3,Mixed feelings,I take it that all bow front tank aren't cut the same because this one dont fit properly the edges over hang and the bow front doesn't match up with my tank... the good thing is that it's not that noticeable and I don't have small children who can bump up against it and possibaly cut themself.
5,Prefecto top,I needed this top after the glue on my orginal top had come loose which in turn left me each time I lifed the lid to feed my fish would come loose and sink down on to the crossbar causing alot of algee there. When I saw this one for the GREAT price it was I knew I had to get it I had looked a local pet shops and they wanted a lot more for the same lid if they had it in stock most would have to order it because of the shape BOWFRONT- I love the fact that it has stayed together and I do not run the risk of cutting my hand trying to put it back together nor do I have the algee on the crossbar any more- It looks GREAT can see in to the tank without any interference now WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE-infact recomended to a friend who is looking to buy something for her tank the day after I got my bowfront topThank you
4,French XTC!,"These guys are actually Belgian, I believe, but were very popular in France in the mid-90s. Their early stuff is less interesting New Wave pop but as they matured, they evolved into a spot-on imitation of latter-day XTC (ie: Oranges & Lemons, Nonesuch), hence Beatle-esque prog-pop with a melancholy tinge. Colin Moulding even guests on a few tracks from L'Homme Aux Mille Vies (perhaps their best album), four tracks of which make it onto this Best Of. Mobilis in Mobile comes highly recommended too."
3,Gildan Crew Neck Sweatshirt,The product (sweatshirt) was average as far as quality. Orange is hard to find especially without a hood or zipper. I was pleased that Amazon made it easy to locate what I needed. The shipping was EXTREMELY slow & did not meet the deadline as promised which was disappoining.
3,Description,"Lady Alayne's remarkable beauty acts as an irresitible lure to the knights of Queen Eleanor's Court of Love. Unhappy in her first marriage, she has no desire to tie herself to another man. Until the arrival of Sir Ralph de Banewulf. His tragaic past touches her, and his commanding figure is hard to ignore.On the Queen's orders, Alayne must accompany Sir Ralph to England. A marriage between them would ensure Alayne's protection, but this gallant knight carries secrets never shared--and, if Alayne were to marry him, she might just discover the darkness that lies at the heart of the Banewulf household...I have not read the book so rating in inaccurate, it would not let me leave a description without rating this item... I will re-adjust my rating after I've read the book."
4,"Not So Hot, but Lovely","These are very lovely, and well made. I'm sure they would last a lifetime with reasonable care. Unfortunately for us, they were very, very thin, and provided almost no insulation. We may have missed something in the description, but these are ""dress mittens"" for upstate New York, and what my wife needs are warm mittens. We returned them, but only because of the thermal problems."
3,Alright,"Not macho enough for me to wear, I gave it to my sister. Didn't have it long enough to inspect the clasp, so I can't comment on it."
4,Nice,I've had this product for two months. I'm pleased with how it works. Finding cassette players these days at a reasonable price is difficult. The reason I gave only 4 stars is because I can hear the tape turning when it plays and it can sometimes be annoying. Overall though I am pleased with the product and happy that I don't have to buy CD or MPs versions of some of my favorite tapes.
4,Nice walkman,"This walkman is great,it gets good reception and plays cassette tapes well.The only thing I didnt like about it was the belt clip.it is held in place with a plastic screw and it broke very easily.Lots of presets and the hold button stops it from accidently switching stations."
2,Cheesy,"The opening track from Armand Van Helden is outstanding, then it goes downhill fast. I was looking for something a little darker and harder. It makes me feel like maybe I'm not missing out on much if I never go to Ibiza."
5,"fragrant, mild soap","For years I used this mild soap on my sensitive skin. The only soap I found that is milder is Jergens Mild soap, but it is not fragrant like the B and F soap nor is it as pretty. This is a great bargain for the top quality, health value and attractiveness."
5,Brilliantly Worded Book,"Have you ever wanted a tattoo of a dragon? What if it was alive? Well, fourteen year old thief Jack Morgan has to deal with one and it is extremely hard for him. Jack is a fourteen-year-old thief who's been through a military struggle for a mine and a political war between Cornelius Braxton and Aurther Neverlin for Braxton Corporation. He has Draycos, a K'da poet-warrior, as an ally and a friend. His main frame computer is programmed like his dead uncle, Virgil Morgan. Jack is now a slave on Brum-a-Dum and needs to find out about the organization that is trying to stop K'da and Shotine trips.This is the third book in the dragonback series. Timothy Zhan is an awe inspiring writer. He makes it go at break neck pace and it nearly turns its pages itself. He makes you seem like you are with Jack and Draycos. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes weird aliens and battles on the sky and ground. Also I'd recommend it to any one who likes Star Wars.JJP"
5,An excellent dipiction of Muslim women lives,I have never seen a documentary as unique and thought provoking as Nazrah. Farah Nousheen helped me into a view I knew verylittle about. I look forward to her next film.A must have for anyone who is interested in expanding their conciousness of women and Islam through the perspective of Muslim women themselves.
2,These are not 6 point wrenches and they say on the box 12 point.,They are big and made in China. The problem is they are 12 point and not 6 point. If you need a very large set of 12 point wrenches than these are for you.
2,Street life is maaaad weak,"On paper, a six volume cd of the ""best of undergroud"" rappers representing every area of the country sounds great. In the stereo, however, it just falls short. First of all there is waaaay too much no limit stuff. The last time I checked, Master P wasn't anywhere near the best that hip hop has to offer. There are far too many songs on this six disc set that are just filler. Some of the best tracks are those by E-40 and Suga T. In short, no true head will nod to these trax cause they ain't bangin'. To all those Versace and Cristal, make money wannabees and the bout it bout it rowdy bounce fools that buy no Limit. this is for you"
2,Harnessing complexity... without the harness,"In the first paragraph of the preface of this book, Axelrod and Cohen ask, ""In a world where many players are all adapting to each other and where the emergring future is extremely hard to predict, what actions should we take?"" As a ""reader from Boston"" recommended, providing recommendations for practical application (7 Habits of Complexity?) would have helped answer this question.Unfortunately, even the authors' anectodal examples provide little insight into HOW to ""harness"" complexity. While this book is primarily aimed at ""designers and policy makers,"" it may actually be most useful to consultants looking to add new buzzwords to their bs lexicon.I would recommend Briggs and Peats's ""Seven Life Lessons of Chaos"" for those who are looking for a more nuts-and-bolts approach to these issues."
2,too generic and hard to put it into practical use,"Overall, I think the book is too generic, only touching the surface of complexity/organizational theory. Hard for me to get any good action steps/tips for my practical job.The author pointed out three points of ""Complex Adaptive System""- variation- interaction- selectionIt looks like something new. However, the author only talks on the very surface level of these three concepts. He explained why variation/interaction/selection is good to corporate organization, just as it is good for living beings. Yet, you can't find specific action steps to work on. In addition, if we do not go into deeper level (or new meaning), these three concepts will be just like old concepts with new names (i.e. diversity/teamwork/performance evaluation).Net, I find this book is hard for practical use, and only recommend it to people who are extremely interested in complexity theory."
2,the unseen: a very mysterious book,"The Book, The Unseen was a great book. It was a very mysterious book and it dealt with figuring out a mystery to the world. I will not tell you every little detail about the the book but I will tell you some things about this book. Thus book is a great book it is also well written and it makes you feel as though you are there. It makes you feel as though you are going through the same thing that Xandra is going through. Xandra is the main character in this book. She loves animals and cares for every one that she finds that is injured. One animal in particular is a beautiful white swan that she finds in the woods that had been shot. The beautiful bird enede up leaving her a surprise which ended up being a key to the world. But to find out what that is you must read the book and find the key to the world with Xandra."
3,Okay,"I found this book to be okay. While the author uses excellent metaphors and the ideas in the book are both deep and creative, you don't really get to know the characters. When I read this book, I felt like I was reading it, not in it. The characters felt like characters, not friends or enemies. Also, the book is sometimes repetitive. One of the main characters, Belinda, at first sounds mysterious, but after a while, she sounds rather annoying. Also, Xandra repeatedly critisizes her family until she finally gets to know them. All in all, you should read this book, but check it out of a library instead of buying it. After you read it once, you may not want to read it again."
3,"Okay, but not worth the money.","This book is okay, but doesn't have the amount of suspense that makes other books like it good. It takes a long time to get into the story, and is way too repetitive at times. Don't waste your hard earned money one this one, because it's not worth it."
5,A CD to play over and over again...,"This CD has it all...expressive performances, crystal clear sound, and the talents of Brahms and Frost. This is truly a CD that you will want to listen to often, as it will remind you of how a restful autumn afternoon can be..."
5,Oxygen Sensor for a 1996 Toyota Tercel,This sensor was very easy to install and plugged right in to the Toyota's plug. I reset the check-engine light and it has'nt come back on.
4,Fast Paced High Technology Thriller,"In the Butcher Bird, a group of foreign nationals, led by a brilliant but frustrated Aerospace Design Genius, and a talented Software Engineer develop an incredible weapon. This weapon, designed to loiter in an area, searching for a target, and instantly dispatching the target, without detection. When the CIA finds out about the scheme, they call upon a high tech aerospace thinktank to design a similar weapon, and find it's weakness's. Using beyond state of the art tactics, the team develop a profile to prevent a national disaster"
2,"Decent, but not up to par","Dean Ing is a competent writer, but for some reason fell short with this novel. Butcher Bird is about an embittered aerospace engineer with an inflated ego and his Syrian funded creation, a technological marvel for assassins, using ""Black"" stealth technology and a miniature nuclear power source. The villain uses his ""Butcher Bird"" to knock off top aerospace researchers he feels have slighted him in some way in the past. The hero of the book, a nearly-flawless, middle-aged man with a practically teen-aged lover, single handedly tries to rescue the world from this mad scientist. I found Butcher Bird to be an entertaining, but, in the end, disappointing story. It starts with a bang and goes out with an unrealistic, overly contrived fizzle"
1,Never Received,"I don't know about the product because I never received it. I can only speak to the vendor who supposedly was selling it. It has not arrived. Even if it is delivered today, that is way too slow by any standard."
3,Pretty Good,"This movie is good, lots of laughs, and an interesting ending. Plus Keaton's muscles made it a good watch."
3,Rain on a Parade,"I hate to add a little rain to a parade of positive reviews, but I judge a ballet more on the beauty of the choreography (and of course the dancers' ability to dance that choreography) and the beauty of the music (and to a lesser extent, the beauty of the staging). This ballet doesn't have the beauty of choreography/dancing nor the beauty of music of: Swan Lake by the American Ballet Theatre, Sylvia by the Royal Ballet, The Firebird by the Royal Ballet, Manon by the Australian Ballet, Romeo and Juliet by the La Scala Ballet, La Sylphide by the Ballet de l'Opera National de Paris, or A Midsummer Night's Dream by the Pacific Northswest Ballet. It's a 3 star ballet in my judgement."
3,Get What You Pay For,"I bought this unit to replace a 21 year old 20"" JVC that I paid $435 for that many years ago. No comparison regarding color and clarity/sharpness. It's used in a small TV room so I was happy to get one for this price and happy that this one is a little larger. In future, I will not buy a TV online without viewing it prior to buying."
3,"Beautiful music, bad signal-to noise recording.","A beautiful rendition of the ""Symphony of Sorrowful Songs"". The soprano is magnificent, however, the recording is annoying. One must raise the volume to a high level and must listen to a lot of noise accompanying the music."
4,Good All-Star Cast,"This album is neat because it features quite an excellent cast of musicians singing with Bill Monroe. Ralph Stanley does a beautiful and haunting job singing lead on ""Harbor of Love."" That cut is definitely the best on this album. Ricky Skaggs and the Osborne Brothers are also featured on this album to name a few. The selection of songs are wonderful, and the harmonies and instrumental really stand out as being impressive. Bill Monroe's voice sounds excellent, and he really picks up the pace on a number of the tunes. The reason I like this Monroe album is because of that beautiful rendition with Ralph Stanley and the fact that the album features different lead singers to compliment Monroe. This is pure traditional bluegrass gospel from not just Bill Monroe but a host of talented bluegrass artists."
5,"Another great, late-career Bill Monroe gospel album","A fine bluegrass gospel release, with strong ensemble work from Clarence Tate, Tom Ewing and Blake Williams, who formed the core of the Blue Grass Boys at the time, as well as numerous guest stars and contributors, such as Ricky Skaggs, Ralph Stanley, Jim & Jesse and Mac Wiseman. The sound of the record is much softer than Monroe's typical ""high lonesome"" sound, and Bill himself seems somewhat subsumed by all the flurry of other musicians, but it's still a fine album, regardless. Mighty fine! Recommended."
3,It's Okay,Nice that it lights up in the dark but it is also very see through and is a funny color. Different than the usually coleman ones.
4,Fun Addition To The McDuff Series,"As a Westie owner and lover of children's books, this title fits well with the others in the series. Sure to be a hit with the small children at Christmastime, McDuff helps Santa when he's in need. The illustrations are fantastic and capture the heart of this little breed."
4,"Great Product, Defective Unit",This is not my first Zalman 9700 so I knew what to expect. Unfortunately this one had a bit of an issue. The fan is off balance and is making a tick noise. The good news is Amazon has been very helpful in getting a new cooler and sending the old one back.Thank you
1,Not Worth the Trouble,"This item looked really cool, so I bought one. It was a bit of a pain to install, compared to other coolers. Fan works, cools pretty well, but the LED's worked for about 5 minutes after I installed it, then quit.Now, when I turn the system on, the LED's will light for a second or so, then go out.Not only is this a big disappointment, but, if I wanted to return it, I'm looking at tearing my whole system apart again, returning the defective item, then waiting for them to send another one - What, 2-3 weeks with no PC?So what, order another one and risk wasting another $45?Pass..."
2,Fan Noise,"The fan is improperly balanced and makes a clicking noise at low speeds. At top speed it sounds like a jet engine! It cools 10C better than Intel stock cooler but at approximately the same noise level - my power supply is the loudest fan in the rig when the Zalman is spinning at lower speeds. Astonishingly, it cools my i7 reasonably well as a heatsink without any fan at all. The Zalman website is terrible to navigate and very slow. Also - this cooler requires patience and nerve to install, the instructions are pitiful. I would like to replace the fan with one that is not defective - if I can do it without having to take the heatsink off the MOBO first. No way I have found to contact Zalman about that. Be aware that if you want to install this cooler, you should plan to install it while the MOBO is outside of the case. It is very heavy."
4,good,It fits on a mini itx board no problem. Very impressed on how fast this got shipped.sturdy design and quiet
4,Best cooler!,"This cooler is awesome, it keeps my E8400 at 30-39C when idling. This cooler is HUGE so you need a big case with lots of work space, The installation was kinda hard for me because my case is pretty small but I managed to fit it in."
3,Beware of size requirements,"I have a Zalman cooler installed in one of my PCs, and love it. Be aware, however, that the cooler requires a large amount of space, including 14.5 centimeters of clear height above the processor in the case. Unfortunately, the Amazon website does not list this requrement, and when I received the cooler, I realized my case was about 2 centimeters too small. In any circumstances if the cooler fit the height it would have impinged on the installed memory. The cooler gets 5 stars for overall design and function, 1 star for adaptability to tight cases.Zalman has alternative coolers that are smaller, although they are still quite large. Check the Zalman website to determine free space requirements"
5,"Looks good, easy install for AMD boards.","Upon receiving this cooler, it took all of 5 minutes to install on my AM3 board. You do not have to swap brackets or anything, just take the old stock cooler off and snap this one in place. My only complaint is that it doesn't cool any better than my stock Phenom II cooler...and actually gets hotter if the fan isn't turned up, but this thing is a LOT quieter!"
5,Zalman Cool & Quiet,"I am using P5b Deluxe Wifi motherboard with Q6600 CPU on P180 Antec case. Fits great, very quiet and looks awesome.One time I have decided to upgrade my stock intel CPU fan with Zalman 9700 due to high temperature on extensive computation (about 51 C). Installation is simple. I had to take out the motherboard off first because you will need to install bracket at the back of the motherboard. I am using Arctic Silver 5 as thermal compound instead of one that comes from the product.Here's the new result estimation before and after the installation:With Intel stock fan, on extensive computation: 51 CWith Zalman 9700, silent mode, extensive computation: 41 CWith Zalman 9700, normal speed, extensive computation: 31 CWith Zalman 9700, normal speed, idling: 21 CI am running silent mode, because it's a bit noisy on normal mode. Good luck upgrading your fan!"
3,comfortable,It is easy enough to use but haven't used it long enough to know if it is even effective
2,Should be improved,"My complain is: if one is taller than three (3) feet, one does not have an easy time in figuring his/her size. Rising the sliding ""stick"" does no longer correspond to a continuation, but it is discontinue in its sequence. Let's say, reading the centimeters which are much easier to read than the inches, being normally 5'4"" (153+) raising the ""stick"" should - as I said - read 154 cm; instead it is reading 160 cm which should really read 104 cm that is now situated at the very top. The scale is expensive enough so to be honest I am not happy with it. Besides, coming directly from the factory, the weight should also be perfect, and the arrow be on a straight line; there also it is off by a whole pound, the arrow hitting the top, rather than being in the middle in perfect balance."
2,Seems outdated,"We have been living in Paris for the last 4 months and have tried to use this book with varied success. We have found may of the entries outdated. In fact the first two restaurants we tried to find no longer exist. Many of the ""Eats"" are by no means cheap (Paris is expensive anyway). There are lots of cheaper ways to eat well in Paris. We have had about the same luck trying places that look interesting."
2,Review of Cheap Eats in Paris,"Somewhat of an informative book, except for one significant flaw. All the eatery reviews were based on the franc instead of the euro!! Hard to get any type of cost concept when this currency has not been used since 2002."
1,Out of date,"If you were to assume that this book would have some incorrect information since it was published this long ago you would still be disspointed. Not only are the prices still in francs but half of the resturants listed have moved, changed their prices drastically or simply no longer exist. This book might of been valuable when it was printed but no longer is. Don't waste your money."
4,Gamester PS2 DVD Remote,"For quite a small piece of equipment, this remote does the same job as your controller however you get to sit whereeva you want to on the couch, extending longer than the controller would and use the remote with ease. Very cool colours and buttons are labeled very well. Only disadvantage is after using the remote, you will have to switch the analog red light on the dual shock 2 controller back on whereas other remotes ive bought automatically switches it back on after you turn off the infra-red light on the remote reciever"
3,"Interesting, but confusing.","This game plays well for those who have followed the Zelda Saga, however, for the few who purchased the game without having played the others, boss battles were extremely difficult because few hints are provided. It is suggested that this game is more puzzle based than the Seasons variant, and I agree. It was good enough that I played it all the way through, and the secret system it uses is interesting, and enough to warrent playing the other game to enjoy those rewards. I would be happier, though, if more clues were dropped here and there to make boss fights less of a shot in the dark to those of us who've never encountered them on other Zelda games."
4,Gameboy Color's finest moment,"While no one can argue that Oracle of Ages is the best game ever, it's not quite the most original game ever made. Many of the features, such as switching between past and present, were already available in A Link to the Past, by switching between the Light and Dark world. 90% of the items are rehashes of the SNES classic as well. Even the monsters are rehashed. The game itself has some great design, but loses something for lack of originality. On the plus side, the boss fights are admittedly pretty creative. I recommend Ages over it's counterpart, Seasons."
5,Oracle of Ages...Ages of gamers,"I've been a Zelda fan for the past 13 or 14 years. This game (along with it's counterpart Oracle of Seasons) makes for a very good old school feel of gameplay. I fell in love with it and I've yet to beat it (due to lack of knowledge of ...), but I have a very enjoyable time playing the game. Most of the dungons remind me of the good 'ole days where Keese flew around freely, Likelike's took your shield, Octorock's throwing rocks, Moblin's shooting you with arrows, dragons spiting fireballs, Dodongo's eating bombs, multiheaded drangons flying around trying to kill you. And the music grabs you once again. The land of Hyrule is under attack. Old school gameplay, incredible music, familiar characters and enemies...it dosn't get any better than this. Buy it, I know I will!"
5,Zelda's back on GBC and better then ever!,"Legend of Zelda Oracle of ages is an extremely good game. Anyone who likes the Legend of Zelda Links Awakening will fall instantly in love with it. With tons of new items like the harp of ages, and different seeds, and a bunch of old school items like rocs feather, and the power bracelet. With 8 dungons full of mind blowing puzzles, awesome new enemies and bosses shall keep you playing for a while. The only thing that was dissapionting for me with this game was that I beat the final boss, Veren, in one try and in Seasons it took me about 15 tries to beat the final boss. If you want more puzzles - get Ages. If you want more fighting - get Seasons."
5,WWOOWW,"This game is amazing! Great characters,bosses,items,and weapons! This game can evn link up with Oracle Of Seasons for a final ultimate boss. If there's one thing you'll do for me make it buying this game. I promise you won't regret it!"
4,The series just get better with every new game!!!!,"I like Ages because it has lots of puzzles. I love puzzles better than fighting, so I chose this game as a favorite beacuse the storyline is really clear and has great sounds and graphics. I'm not saying Seasons is bad, though. The best part in when you link up, because you really get more out of your games. I would recommend Ages to anyone that loves puzzles."
3,Help I am stuck in a Child's Game,I purchased the 2 Oracle games for my 10 year old. I usually play them with him so that I can help through the rough spots and also because I enjoy strategy games. I have been stopped cold in both of these games by the various puzzles that require solving before you can move on. It is almost impossible to win the dance contest for the boomerang in the Seasons game and I have not been able to shoot enough crystals in the cart game or enough fairies in the target game or do the dance moves to get the mermaid keys. There should be a way around these puzzles. If adults have a hard time completing them how can children? My son has already lost interest and I am out [$]. Has anyone else had these problems?
5,Ookla the Rock!,"As always, Ookla the Mok combines energetic, garage-band tunes with witty lyrics to brew up the kind of catchy songs that you end up humming all day long. Some topics include: Cher's posterior (P.M Prima Donna), a plea to keep Lt. Worf from the command chair (Mr. W), and a semi-psychotic rant on the state of creativity of the former leader of the Police (O Sting). Great stuff!"
3,Good Pictures - Some Bad Information,"The photos are great to look at. Some info about Dale Earnhardt was incorrect - he did not drive his Wrangler car to his first championship. Overall, okay book for the price."
4,Good informative book,"Got this book for my young son. He loves race cars and this book gives him a lot to learn and look at. Unfortunately, the way NASCAR changes logos and sponsors, the driver info becomes out of date quick. The history lesson of the sport is great, though."
2,Historical Revisionism,"The book is an entertaining enough introduction to stock car racing, and our son enjoys reading and tracing pictures of cars out of the book. But to my mind, it falls far below the standard of the Dorling-Kindersley series and is little more than a promotional piece for the current NASCAR sponsor. The sea change from real stock cars to the current lookalike shells is glossed over, but most of all the championship is referred to throughout, even in the historical sections, as the ""NEXTEL Cup."" This is sheer historical revisionism and unworthy of the DK series. Or are they simply terrified that children will take up smoking if they read about the ""Winston Cup""?"
1,you are garbage,"this cd is garbage!!!the real spanish fly is Daz,Ace,Fino,and Johnny D.og spanish fly tried to claim the name, but have no skills in this rap game!!!hey maniac you can't touch the real Spanish F.L.Y.or them New Element Soldiers!!it's DEVIOUS so you know who said it!"
5,Swing With Me Karl,"David Rehak is carving out a sexy and intelligent career based on his two novels and essays about the Queen of Mean, Lizzie Borden.In ""Love and Madness"" we are once again in Rehak's Land of Compulsion and Infatuation: Karl and Bertha are Lovers avoiding the realities of their sexual drives and indulging in them at the same time.Rehak is a master of the innuendo, a slimy yet tasteful purveyor of sex and perversion. He writes with passion as only a young man can do: and we feel it, not only in our hearts but in our groins as well.""Love and Madness""is sexy and fun,filled with intelligent insights into the psyche of his characters and a must read for anyone interested in contemporary fiction. Now we need to see D. Rehak use his obvious skills on a major work that encompasses not only his baser feelings but his artistic ones as well."
5,Valuable Today For Perspective,"When you read the news these days about the current war you would think that before Vietnam all of America was behind our war efforts, but as this CD shows it just was not the case. For example, during and before World War I many, many people thought there was no reason for us to go and fight because europe was ""Over There."" Of course we did fight and it helped make the world a better place. What I liked about this CD was that it has both the pro and anti war arguments preserved so you can make up your own mind on whether or not we did the right thing."
5,A2zcds - You are doing a great service to the nation yourself by bringing out such CDs. Keep it up.,"""I am of the opinion that young Americans should see this CD and feel a part of the making of modern history of this great nation. Moving, stirring, forceful and passionate, these speeches made by some of the greatest statesmen of our nation still ring true even today. A2zcds - You are doing a great service to the nation yourself by bringing out such CDs. Keep it up."""
3,Too short,"Trailer ties that are this short may or may not work for tying your horse once they're in the trailer. My ties are 34""-36"" long. Depends on the size of your horse and how far their head and neck go into the manger area."
3,Okay But Could Have More,"I got this game with a value pack. It wasn't better than Railroad Tycoon 2, but definitely better than Aiport Tycoon.Pros: graphics and scenerio are beautifuleasy to control the bikes esspecially someone that is not into racing type gamesCons:The races in the game in too short, so there is no save buttonYou can't damage your bike or anything like thatAfter playing through the race you are instantly bored with the gameYou get about 5 bikes which that...Only one scenerio make it to Sturgis Bike Rally which is too easy you just have to ride through three cities and you don't get disqualified even if you dead lastThis game could have been a great game for men and women to enjoy, if they would have just add more to it."
3,Great but dated. . . .,"This is an excellent book, but the information is about 3-4 years old (Probably 4-5 years if you consider the time to publishing)! That is pretty dated information for this field, especially with the MANY newer agents. Make a new edition guys!"
2,Font is too small,"I have owned and found valuable prior editions so I was excited to see that a 6th edition had been published. Unfortunately, the font is smaller and lighter making it uncomfortable to read. This is the first time I will have to return a book for this reason and I own several different pocket version books. Look at this editon at a bookstore before you purchase to save on shipping costs. I plan on sending an email to the publisher also."
5,Still The Most Concise Review,"I have used this text from its very first edition. Its slim format makes it easy to carry and handle, yet it is very comprehensive given its size. There are times when Epocrates is not enough and Schatzberg and Nemeroff's volume is too much. The concise tables of dose equivalents are particularly useful."
4,Right size good bristles,My daughter uses it as her everyday hairbrush. She loves the bristles and says it takes out all the knots without pulling her hair. Leaves a nice smooth finish after she blow dries her hair. It has a wood handle and is a very sturdy brush that I think will last for a long time.
4,It does what it should,"This product does work as it should, I have used it both on my iPhone and my iPod. The cord is very long so if you wanted to run it to the back seat of your car I am sure it would make it (though it wont make it to a third row SUV). This cable charges both your iPhone and iPod too. It does not let you control your iPod or iPhone, everything has to be done with the receiver controls. That makes it a pain because going one song at a time to find the one you want takes FOREVER! Best advice is to unplug your iPhone or iPod, find the song u want, push play then plug it back in."
5,Works perfect and the price is right,I finally broke down and bought a used Ipod Classic with an 80Gb hard drive. I listen to 70's and 80's music and do not get a great deal of it on the radio. This little jewel worked out perfect. Now I can take the top off my '88 vette and crank up the sounds with my custom stereo. Life just got better.
3,It works,Look the cable is easy to install and did not take long. The interface is not intuitive for my head unit at least. If I want to get to artist in the m-n I have to scroll for about 1.5 mins at least if I want something from the second half the alphabet I just unplug my Ipod find and replug it is which is hard to do while driving.
1,No me funciona para el ipod touch,"De verdad estoy decepcionado ya que acabo de comprar el reproductor Excelon KDC X991, uno de los ultimos de la línea Excelon, especialmente buscando escuchar la música de mi ipod en el carro, luego de instalarle el cable KCA-IP200, resulta que no me lee las canciones de mi ipod, mi pregunta es si se debe a que es un ipod touch de segunda generación y que por ello no lo lee el reproductor. De verdad me llevo una muy mala impresión porque reproductores de otras marcas si me lo leen a la perfección. Si alguien tiene la solución a mi problema se lo agradecería!"
3,should work,"Item looks okay, seems to be nothing more than the regular cable that comes with an i-pod with the addition of an ear-phone jack. I have not installed it yet but it should do the job okay."
5,Good Rock and Roll Grooves!!!,I came across this band by chance. It is a very good band. I listen to this CD often. These guy's make very good music.
2,one hit wonder,"I bought this because of Hundred Mile High City that is featured on the Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels soundtrack. That song rocks, but the rest of the record sounds nothing like it and is pretty boring."
3,Same CD as Sacred Spirit II?,"I have not listened to this CD, but the track listing for ""Sacred Spirit V.3 [presumably, volume 3]: More Chants and Dances of the Native Americans"" is identical to the track listing for ""Sacred Spirit II: More Chants and Dances of the Native Americans."" I have decided not to buy this album, as I already own Sacred Spirit II. Not long ago, I made the mistake of buying both the album ""Sacred Spirit: Chants and Dances of the Native Americans"" (Sacred Spirit, Vol. I) and the Sacred Spirit album ""Yeha-Noha,"" which has the same songs as Sacred Spirit, Vol. I, only in a different order. I suspect this is a similar repackaging."
5,"good o rings, a little expensive",if you need o rings this is what you need. a little pricy but no alternatives really.
3,O Ring,"Product received exactly as described and in a timely manner. Haven't used any yet, but I'm sure they are just as they need to be."
5,Glorious,Absolutely wonderful book. Captures the complexities and horrors of the English Reformation. I was so sad when I was finished with the book because I didn't want it to end!
1,Too Big to handle!,"I know this book is excellent and I thought I would save money buying it in this particular form... For what it is, it's put together well and decent quality but the paperback book is so large and cumbersome, I didn't even get through it and it sits in the bookshelf, unread. It's just awkward, wish I never bought it."
3,"Not as easy to use as I hoped, but still a good product","Makes pretty curls, however you do have to take your time and use only small sections at a time. Probably not the best for those of us in a hurry, but still a decent product worth having."
2,Centurion 12-Piece Block not the sharpest knives in the drawer,These knives were not particularly sharp right out of the box. I cannot imagine that repeated use will improve them.
4,Nice knife set for the price,"This is a very nice mid-price knife set. Nice weight and sturdy construction. The block is fair, but needs more slots...lots of wasted space. You don't have room to add other knives. But all in all a nice set. ***Does anyone ever really use the scissors?"
4,Good Knives on a budget,"Knives are solid built but the stainless needs to be a little more rust resistant. Sharpen well, must hand wash, and are pretty fair at holding an edge."
5,Great gift item. My mother-in-law loved it!,"I own a similar set by Chicago Cutlery. This set is slightly different from the one I own and although my mother-in-law wanted one like mine, she was very pleased with this one. Had more pieces (steak knives) than my set but she was overall pleased with it and is sold on the quality of cutlery made by CC."
3,NOT as shown in picture above,"I just received the item. I chose the 12-piece set because the picture above showed extra slots to enable expansion. Also, another consumer review on this page specifically commented on the extra slots. It DOES NOT HAVE EXTRA SLOTS for a bread knife or any other knife. That being said, I am pleased with the overall quality. Amazon just needs to update the picture."
3,Rembrandt for Kids,"Very basic information on Rembrandt. Kind of a ""Rembrandt for kids"" version. It does contain some very nice plates."
5,The must have calculator,"This is it if you're doing real estate or managing money. Great product, easy to use, and the seller delivered as promised. What more do you need to say?"
4,Calculating happiness!,"So happy to find this calculator, the newer version does not work as well and cost many times as much. When we ordered this Calculator on Amazon, it arrived in perfect condition, works perfectly so we are just ""calculating our happiness""."
4,First time with financial calculator.,"I don't have anything else to compare with since this is my first financial calculator...It's easy to use, does a great job and straightforward financial calculator. I am very happy with it."
4,Easy to use,Features and button are simple and easy to use for basic calculations and finance calculations. Would highly recommend over the other name brands
1,Display no longer works....,My husband purchased this in January of 2009. The display no longer works. Great calculator as long as you don't need to see the results of the calculation.
2,Display died after two years,"I bought this same calculator from Amazon about two years ago and have used for appraising. I like the layout of the keys and the functionality - it's all you need for appraisal work. About two years of using it the display began to die, one digit at a time. Now I can no longer use it and have to buy another one. Not sure I want to considering the poor quality."
4,Great financial calculator,"Although I gave it 4/5 stars, it is still a great calculator and probably the best financial calculator out there. I just have a hard time adjusting to HP's version of ""algebraic"" entry rather than what I'm used to from HP, their ""reverse Polish notation"" entry system. I wish this allowed you to switch between the two as you can with some of their other calculators."
3,Great calculator...poor build quality,"This is my FIFTH HP 10bII. I have lost a few and had a couple of displays fail (due to cold in a car overnight, I think). I would like to stop buying them, but it is the easiest to use and best calculator I have found."
4,a real time saver,"this calculator is a great time saver. i've manually calculated interest rates, time value of money, discounts, and compounding figures and this calculator makes it all so much easier.it's a great buy for an average person who wants to take control of their finances and decide where to invest their money for the best returns.don't buy it from HP because their customer service is terrible."
5,"Great for Accounting, Auditing, and Finance courses","This nifty calculator comes with a manual that explains all the functions and how to operate a certain set of functions to calculate ratios, ROEs, etc. I used it for a course and since then I have been smitten."
4,(4/5) 2nd Best Finance Calculator,"This calculator comes a bit short in function when you compare it to it's father the 17b II+ (HP 17BII+ Financial Calculator, Silver). However, when you do price comparison, this calculator works just fine for a $30 compared to an $80.Pro(s):- Good amount of functions (CFLO, PV, IRR, FV, etc.)- Slim design- Comes with faux leather caseCon(s):- None (if you read the manual)Recommendation(s)/Suggestion(s):- If you're not a finance major then this is the right calculator for you. This calc isn't the easiest to use; if you can get the HP 17b II+ at a cheap price or borrow it, then please by all means do so.Overall, this calc got me thru a basic finance course easily."
1,A Piece of Junk,"The keys don't respond well, thus when you hit the button for the answer you are looking for, you wonder why it is off or simply wrong,,, because the keys don't respond well. This calculator is a piece of junk."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this calculator based on HP's strong reputation for quality financial calculators. What a mistake! The first one lasted two months before the display malfunctioned. One month plus later ... the replacement they sent under warranty was slightly better -- it lasted three months before the same display malfunction. The third (again a replacement received under warranty) worked fine under regular use for two months, then sat unused for three months, and then malfunctioned. Because I have now received 1 year of calculator service (HP's calculation based on the date I purchased the first calculator), the warranty has now expired and HP will not replace the defective calculator. Buy an abacus, it's certain to be more useful!"
3,HP Calculator Review,The calculator works better than the first one sent by amazon. The first one sent had buttons that did not work for the entire first numerical column. This second one still seems to display several functional issues still but does provide correct answers so it is fine. Not overly impressed by the whole amazon process.
5,financial calculator,"The calculator came with nice packaging, a users guide so I could figure out how to use it and it was timely in arrival."
4,Light easy to carry!,Very functional and useful for the exam! Thanks HP.cm I got my CFP on the first try ready to work and make some money!
4,Hp financial calculator,This is an easy to use calculator that makes complex financial equations seem simple. It was in great condition when I bought it used and very affordable. I'd recommend it to any finance student or anyone that needs a way to ease their own struggles with finance.
5,My re-purchase - Great Calculator,I purchased this to replace the calculator I've been using since college (same exact model). It worked fine for years until it got crushed under some heavy items when I moved. This calculator is easy to use and it made an easy transition from the classroom to the office - I now use it professionally and I still love it.
2,flimsy case,"Just as 1 year warranty expired display went garbled. From day one, casing felt flimsy -while pressing keys, case would rattle like interior of a mid-80's mustang. Not sure if rattle would have been reason for warranty replacement, but i'm sure that cheap assembly was it's ultimate demise.Although calculator was feature rich and came with great manual, thats about all that can be said for it."
2,Poorest Quality,I purchased this calculator about half a year ago. After a month the keys start sticking and you have to press harder to input the values. After 4 month the LCD started to malfunction. Will never buy an HP calculator again - even cheaper no name calculators are sturdier.
1,Good calculator....when it doesn't burn out,"Worked fine for two years, then the LEDs started to burn out. Not it's useless."
2,Great while it lasted,This was my first HP financial calculator which I bought after owning TI calculators for years. I bought it on reputation and it worked well until it died. It didn't even outlast the batteries. I think I'll go back to TI. They seem a lot more rugged.
3,Can't beat the my 14b,This is a pretty good calc but you can tell that it is not a durable as the 12c or the 14b calc. The older HP calcs have a better feel and weight to them. This one feels a bit flimsy. Great price @ Amazon.
5,Great product!,All I can say is that I'm happy with my purchase. This calculator is easy to use as compared to the TI. And I found it for the cheapest price on Amazon!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this heap the first time in 2002 and by March 2004 the display no longer worked properly. I called HP and they said they were aware of such a problem and sent me a new one although I was outside the 1 year warranty. March of 2006 the second one's display no longer works properly. When I called HP and asked about replacing they said ""you are outside the warranty."" I asked if they new about the problem they apparently have. The goof I talked to said ""he was not aware."" I asked why it is that this one is a heap but the HP12c lasts forever. His reply was it is a $30 calculator.I have a TI regular caclulator that was $5 20 years ago that still works. I am moving on to TI. I will never buy an HP anything for the simple fact that they either know of the problem and do not correct it or they are to dumb to notice that there is a problem. Either way I am not dealing with their inferior products again."
4,Good for Finance.,"A little difficult to understand at first, but with the help of the instruction booklet this calculator is a must-have for any financial management classes. It does everything for you with a few simple key strokes."
5,Great,This product did exactly what I needed it to while taking the ASM classes through IREM to obtain my CPM.
4,good product good price,"i have read a lot amazon ratings before making the purchase.i bought this product three months ago and it is still working fine.i think it'll working this way for i do not know how long.the size, the weight and the feeling when u touch the calculator is good.there is enough screen to read with no problem plenty of numbers.the design is simple and gives enough bells for the eyes to like what they see.the keys are also well made so there is ""i did not push this number without paying attention.""the price is around $30 and if you are a student you'll probably like that.we are talking about a quality product here.conclusion: buy the hp 10bII if you need a financial calculator."
4,Needed for class,"I needed this calculator for class and I didn't want to pay the hefty price at the school book store. This shipped quickly and saved me some money. Came with batteries, and everything is working well!"
1,Look at others before wasting your $$,"This calculator is inexpensive and easy to operate, but beyond that it's a piece of junk. I know, I've had three over the last five years. The first one had a key that didn't work. The display on the second one faded away after about a year. I tossed the third one because I had to lean on the keys to get them to operate. The 12c is more expensive and a little harder to operate but far less frustrating."
1,Poor Quality & older version,This calculator arrived with very little battery life & wasn't an up to date as those in the store but cost more than the new ones in the store after paying shipping. I asked for a refund but te seller denied.
4,Just for a course's need.,"It is OK, but if my professor doesn't ask for it, I won't buy this caculator."
1,beware of the item switch,"I ordered the financial/business calculator, but received the 10b II financial calculator. The item code (F1902A # ABA) for the business one is the same as the financial calculator. I was charged the higher priced business calculator, but received the lower priced financial calculator."
1,Such a diappointment,"I rarely give bad reviews, please check out my others for verification. This one is different because HP has scrimped on quality to save a buck and ruined a great product. I've owned: 2, HP 19BII; 1, 12b; 2, 10b; 1 10bII. The new 10bII has damaged my opinion of HP substantially. I have also owned 2 Texas Instruments BAII Plus. (The CFA Institute has made changes over time). I'm much more comfortable with HP than TI, but the HP 10bII is a faint shadow of the 10b and is of VERY low build quality. My ""5"" key requires significant pressure to register. In fact, the 10bII is a flimsy piece of junk."
3,"Great Value, but quality suspect. Conked out","Great value for the money because of what it can do. I also have an HP 48 SX that I bought new in 1991, which died in 1994 due to static Electicity (not HP's fault), replaced it with another HP48SX, and still have that one and still use it almost every day, 11 years later!However, the 10B2 I bought conked out. The display stopped working correctly, however, I think the calculator itself still functioned. The display partially worked. It did this about 6 months after I bought it. IT was so cheap, that I will probably buy another, but check the warrantee more carefully."
1,Dissappointing quality and keypad,"I bought this calculator because I wanted a 12 digit display, comma separators for multiples of a thousand, and some standard financial functions, all in a form small enough to slip in a jacket pocket. I didn't find any other brand offering a calculator with these features and I thought that HP had a good reputation.I was very dissappointed. The keys required a lot of pressure to work and I often had to redo calculations because I had keyed too fast and one or more keys hadn't registered.Then after a year the screen stopped working properly. I was actually pleased about this because it meant that I could replace the calculator without feeling guilty!I'm afraid I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,"Hard Keystroks, yet good functions","I am not familiar with financial calculators, however, after reading and comparing reviews, I settled on this one. The calculators functions are excellent. The backspace button to clear any errors is one of the best features as is the input button. The only downside is that the buttons are hard/stiff to press, which can be annoying."
2,hold the keys down very firmly to make sure the operations take place,Keys are stiff and sometimes you have to hold the keys down very firmly to make sure the operations take place. As a result it was giving me bad results even when I had definitely pressed the key all the way down. The original HP10B I previously owned was a much better quality and the keys let you do operations smoothly. I guess this HP10bII will function for me if I remember to very firmly hold down each key when I press it.
3,Great thing to calculate present value,If the rubber stoppers on the back didn't fall off within the first couple days this product would have received a
4,Paul M's Review of HP 10bII Financial Calculator,"If you are using this for small amounts of data the HP 10bII is very good, however, for large amounts of data points, a PC spreadsheet is much better.I'm happy with the purchase due to the relatively low cost and portability and the wide selection of financial functions."
4,"Great condition, on time shipping","Great condition, timely shipping, I was able to find the manual online, so that was good. Great seller, thank you!"
2,Poor value... the HP12C is much better,"The HP12c seems much more widely used in financial planning. The 10bII should be retired permanently. Rounding errors between the two are a problem, so I always go with the HP12c."
3,Calculator automatically rounds up to the nearest hundreth.,I bought this about four weeks ago for my real estate class and later found out that it rounds up to the nearest hundreth. For example:An answer of .275 will be indicated as .28 which leads you to believe is 28 percent.Do not throw your money away and get a Real Estate calculator like the Equalizer II plus if you are serious about the business.
1,PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY...,"I have owned this calculator for 3 months and the dispay is no longer working properly. Parts of the numbers have ""burned out"" so only parts of the numbers show now. At first I thought it was the batteries. SO I bought replacements and that was NOT the problem. It is now completely useless. At $30, this calc is 10x's more than what a basic calc costs, so that is no excuse for such a poor quality product. PLEASE read the reviews - they all say the SAME thing. I was a fool for buying this. I hope this will help you."
4,I like it but some fonts are too small,"I've been using the ""original"" HP 10-B for years and years. I find it of much better quality and easier to use than the Texas Instruments BA-II +.I got this latest version because many of my students now are using it. It's fine -- except that the type font for the alternative functions (gold and blue) is smaller than on my ""original"". I find it hard to read, whereas I have no problem reading the (gold) font on my older HP 10-B calculator. That's why I give this calculator 4 stars -- when I'm working on my own I much prefer the older model."
1,Defective product,I was surprised at the defective product i got.The display was not working at all.I had to return it!
4,Great!,Usually I don't like to read manuals to use electronics and just try to figure it out on my own. With this calculator you NEED to read the manual. It really helped me out when I did my Financial Management Exams. My lecturer recommended it and it ended up being quite helpful.
4,calculator in great conditions,I received my calculator sooner than what I expected and in very good conditions. Amazon does really have great deals.
2,disappointed,"My original HP 10B, bought in 1989, is a dream to use. I bought the 10Bll thinking it would be an upgrade. Unfortunately, it is a downgrade. My biggest complaint is the input key. It is the same size as all of the other keys and is placed in a non-intuitive spot on the keyboard. As far as functionality, it is probably on par with the 10B. The keys on the 10Bll are larger than the original, which is nice and it is a nice looking calculator. .."
1,Are you kidding me?,I bought this because it was the recommended calculator for a financial course I am taking. I barely used it and now the off key will not shut off. Great. I have only had it for 2 weeks and now I will have to buy new batteries. I would return it but alreay tossed the packaging. I just didn't anticipate this problem because of the fairly good reviews on this. What a waste of money!
4,HP 10bII financial calculator,"It's a great value. I have a little trouble with the ""0"" key - sometimes it doesn't input - I have to look to see if the number I put in got entered correctly. No other complaints."
5,Excellent printer,"This printer prints great quality photos. I've gotten pictures printed through other companies (online and Walmart) and the HP photos print out as well, if not better than some of them. I compared my professionally printed photos with my HP-printed ones and my dad couldn't even tell the difference! He even commented on how vibrant the colors appear.It was also very easy to install. Five minutes after taking everything out of the box, I was already printing photos. Very easy to use - I didn't even have to read the manual. Now I can print all the borderless 4x6 photos I want in no time.The only downfall is that there is no USB cable included but a lot of printers don't come with that now... plus you can buy a cheap one on amazon. ;)"
1,There is no review,This Photo Printer has not yet been delivered to me. I have tried tracking it and was told that it is in transit. The expected date of arrival was 09/02/2009. It is now 09/12/2009 and it still is not here. I cannot rate it if I do not receive it. I will not order from this place again.
2,should never have bought it,"the picture quality was fantastic...for the first 50 pictures,then message came up ""cartridge running low"" thought this was a gimmick to get me to buy another cartridge before i needed it,but no,sure enough 10 photos later all photos were purple.i wish i had never bought because now i have to pay to send it back.good buy if you dont mind spending $28.95 for new cartridge VERY often."
3,"Printer ok, but insufficient ink","This printer works fine, but the ink that came with it only printed about one third of the first photo. Very poor for this company to send out a product that the consumer is not able to use. I also sent a similar message to the company but have received NO response."
1,Not durable...scam artists at customer support,"We bought our photosmart printer about eight months ago and it recently started having paper jam problems. We have probably printed about 40 pictures on it total. The problem go so bad it would not print anymore. We called technical support and they said that it was a ""software"" problem and that the printer's warranty for software issues is only 90 days. They wanted $59 to fix the problem.While the printer does make great pictures I don't see how paper jamming in the printer would be a software issue."
2,nice saw with poor accuracy,"I use this saw in a stationary shop environment.After a few months of light use, the saw becomes undependable. The 90 degree square fence has to be checked and adjusted constantly. Very frustrating! Perhaps this is why the saw was ""reconditioned?"" Other than the lack of cutting a square edge, the saw works perfectly. The saw is too nice (and expensive) to throw away but can only be used for rough cuts. I will not buy another one of these."
5,Great Job Saw,I have Owned My saw for over 10 Years & being a carpenter by trade it has done a terrific job & still is going strong
4,Waiting for Bluebonnets,"Expertly written by Dr. Lively, Waiting for Bluebonnets is a collection of short stories. Though in the form of letters lovingly written to his daughter, these stories are for everyone. Some are hilarously funny while others will make you weep. The letters are entertaining, yet extremely thought provoking. One gets the message immediately...attempting to incorporate into our own lives all the properties of God's love. It's a terrific book for personal reading pleasure and a keeper for one's library, as well as an excellent gift selection."
3,Transmitter reach is problematic,"While the remote is fully functional. The reach is further than anticipated. I literally can go to my basement, sit on the couch and the garage door will open. If you have a habit of carrying your keys in your pants pockets, this is not the remote for you. If however you carry them in a coat pocket, it's a nice remote. The spouse has no problems when she puts it in her purse. It boils down to where you carry your keys. If the range wasn't so large, I would love it."
5,Great,"Works like original key fob I was replacing. No complaints. Easy to program, looks identical too. I would order again or recommend."
1,Didn't work,Didmt work didn't work didn't work Didmt work didn't work didn't work Didmt work didn't work didn't work Didmt work didn't work didn't work Didmt work didn't work didn't work Can't say enough about how it didn't work
2,Disappointed,"It opens my two garage door openers, but does not work on the Drive-in Front Gate. After many phone calls, I was finally told, that this does not work on Gated car drive-in doors. Disappointed!"
5,Excellent compact garage door opener,I ordered 3 different intellicode garage door openers and these are the most compact and thus far more reliable than the Genie brands and equally as responsive.
5,"Easy to set up, works great!","Bought one of these looking for an easy way to get in/out of the garage on my scooter. The setup was easy -- just hit the ""Learn"" button on your opener motor then click the button you want on the remote -- and the signal range is excellent. After buying the first one, I bought a second one for my other keychain!"
4,Inexpensive and quickly received,"Small, light, easy to program and exactly what I was looking for. Clip it onto my belt loop and I'm in business. Got them fast and at the right price."
1,Waste of time & Money,"Don't waste your time or money. Not user friendly at all, and does not offer a fraction of the options that other programs do. I own several Macs-as we are ""Mac Addicts"" in our home. I have tried this program as well as iScrapbook, Memory Mixer, and a few others. The program that I recommend is Memory Mixer. Memory Mixer offers a full version ($79.99) as well as a lite version ($34.95). If anyone is looking for an easy program to use Memory Mixer is it. It has designer papers/packs with embellishments etc. and is as easy to order products as iPhoto. There is no learning curve, use it straight out of the box. iRemember offers nothing to complement, and leaves you sorely disapointed."
1,It burned itself,"Don't buy it. It is the worst microwave I have ever used. It is not as powerful as 700W should be. It always takes minutes to heat up stuff, as slow as my 12-year-old 550W Emerson. Worst of all, it stopped working after one week with laud humming sound and wire burning smell came from its parts."
5,Awesome,Cravex came highly recommended from a Natural Path Dr. that I know and trust. He is a very strict vegan.I knew this had to be an awesome product and it is I can really control my appetite especially the sugar cravingsIt is also at a great price.
1,""". . .some of the time, but you can't fool me, Roth/Nixon","This book is like an elaborate highschool term paper, full of super-easily researched stories (gotta have those sources) and poignance, but no clear proclaimation that income taxation was a bad idea from the start and should therefore be ended.It would have been very telling for Roth to state how much money he's pocketed during his long time in Washington as one of the good old boy oligarchy.Want to read something ballsy? I highly recommend ""Your Money or your Life"" as one other reviewer did. I got that book, and it really hits the target."
1,Pandering fiction from a self-contratulatory political hack,"Roth made it big beating up on the guy everybody hates rather than tackling difficult issues of governance. Here's another attempt to pat himself on the back - only problem is, he never wrote a single scratch. His able asssistant, Nixon, (from Utah - must be his relatives giving those 5 stars) penned the tome for the illiterate Senator with the ridiculous toupee."
1,Income Taxation is anti-constitutional! This book sucks,"The essence of a constitutional America is for the Federal government to keep our enemies at bay and punish those guilty of direct wrong doing. Apart from that, they should stay the hell out of our lives.An income tax trounces the restrictions on government found in the Bill of Rights. Senator Roth took an oath to uphold the constitution. He is a failure.VOTE LIBERTARIAN!"
1,Obviously the work of a good old oligarchy boy,"The Constitution says that we have certain unalienable rights. Among those rights is the right to pursue happiness.Does income taxation interfere with that right? Of course, for it demands that we surrender our privacy to the federal bullies, and play the role of tax collector without pay and snitch on our neighbor.Roth needs his &%$ kicked."
5,Great Book! I recommend it!,It is obvious that the people who gave this book one star are either tax avoiders or work for the IRS. This book was very informative and helps people know where to go when they need help. It is very good and keeps interest. I recommend it! I wonder if 20/20 with Sam Donaldson based their stories on the book.
5,The kind of book our government leaders should be writing.,"This is the kind of book our leaders should be writing, a careful and compelling analysis of a federal agency that has grown out of control. ""The Power to Destroy"" is entertaining, filled with suspense and a pleasure to read. It offers ample evidence of why the current system needs to be changed. Even more, it provides workable solutions, and gives taxpayers the necessary information they need to protect themselves and effect such change. I recommend this book to taxpayers everywhere."
5,Sound & Vision,"This is a pretty good magazine. I notice that they mostly review high end equipment with high end price tags. I might have to look for a magazine that reveiws items more in my price range. I mean common, a projector for $85,000?!"
3,Memories of the good olld days,"My love of audio (later video) started back in the 60s. I still subscribe to Sound and Vision but it is a pale shadow of Stereo Review, Audio and High Fidelity magazines and their substantive reviews of music and equipment. Likewise the original video magazines are gone as well.For some reason the British still have great magazines in all categories. Too bad they are expensive and not widely available here.If you think the equipment reviewed here is expensive check out Stereophile land of $100k speakers and $10k phono cartridges."
1,Only 8 issues per year,"I've been a subscriber of this magazine for over 40 years. You used to get a new issue monthly and I looked forward to each and every issue. Then it changed to 10 issues per year and now it's down to only 8. Of course, the price remains the same. I got so used to not receiving it that it was hardly noticeable when I dropped my subscription. The part the toasts me most is that I paid for a 3 year subscription when you got monthly magazines. Then they cut the number of magazines. What a rip. When I contacted the company they hardly seemed to care, and did nothing to rectify my situation."
2,So-So Magazine,"It's not the worst magazine that I've subscribed to, but the reviews and articles are usually about high-end equipment that are maybe affordable to the top 5-10% of working Americans. In addition, the articles seem more like advertisements than reviews, with little explanation of the technology behind the products.If you have a lot of money to spend on very highly priced equipment, and want a few suggestions on which expensive components to purchase, this may be the magazine for you. However, if you are an average consumer looking for sound advice on a variety of equipment, this is certainly not a publication for you. Keep looking for another magazine."
2,Dissappointed,"The magazine content is what it is. If you want to read it, then you will enjoy it. That being said, the company has harrassed me for further subscriptions and failed to deliver what I paid for saying that the subscription had expired after one issue. I am aware that independent firms handle subscription sales and the company that I purchased the subscription from was apparently dirtbags."
3,"If you see trash, pick it up...","The acting is bad which is what makes this offering soooo good!Help Wanted Female is the best of the lot, with a Loretta Swit look alike beingsmarmy and seductive. The short film as a bonus features Betty Paige slapping another woman's butt for about 3 minutes. No story, just a pounding."
5,A Must-Have for Anyone into Landscape Ecology or GIS,"If the credentials of the authors didn't convince of the quality of this book, I'm not sure I can. I will say that I have read and re-read the book several times, and that it's a vital resource in our laboratory. From the various issues of scaling to what analyses do what, this book is an excellent resource of theories and technologies involved in Landscape Ecology."
3,Good text in B/W missing CD-ROM with color images,"I purchased this text new from Amazon.com because it is a required text for a graduate Landscape Ecology course. I am enjoying the text (4 stars) but, I am very disappointed that I did not get the CD-ROM (that is suppose to accompany it, so I rated this product just 3 stars). For example, Figure 4.4 on page 79 is a black and white series of images that require color to interpret and the text refers readers to the CD-ROM (missing) for color images! What the heck?"
1,"5 Stars for the music, 1 for the sound quality",This is a seminal album from Lee Perry's Black Ark period but the sound quality on this reissue is extremely poor. It sounds like it was mastered from vinyl (which can be ok) but slightly off the correct speed (which is extremely annoying). Buy this at your own risk...'Arkology' and 'Super Ape' (both on Island) and 'The Heart of the Congos' by the Congos on Blood and Fire records (not the VP Records version) are essential Black Ark missives from the Upsetter that would be a much better use of your cash.
2,"The answer to the bad sound...in my opinion, at least...","...is to buy ""Apeology"" which I think has the same songs, same recording but mastered from a different source to the ""pressed off-centre record"" presented here. I make no promises as I can't listen to them both just at the moment but I think you'll be pleased if, like me, you love the music on here but found it unlistenable in the state it is on this release. Good luck."
5,smoked-out...,"the sound quality is sub-par, but this is the real deal. Skunky, skanky, smoked-out dubs from the echo chamber of the Black Ark. The perfect stoned soundtrack."
2,"Compelling Figure, Uncompelling Autobiography","Arthur Liman was a tremendous lawyer and citizen of this country. He was one of the more cognitively brilliant lawyers of the past 50 years, and possessed a social conscience of the highest order.Unfortunately, something is simply missing in this autobiography. I found it uneven and incomplete. The quality of the book simply doesn't match the quality of the person."
5,"One of the best books in general, highly recommend it for anyone interested in law","I can hardly understand mediocre to negative reviews, and the fact that there are only five reviews for such an excellent book. If anyone is hesitating from reading this book as I was upon reading reviews, please take my word and give it a chance! I am sure first 20~30 pages would prove its value to you, especially if you are interested in law."
5,GREAT LAW...GREAT LAWYER,"Arthur Liman is the ultimate example of a LAWYER with talent, intelligence, and involvement in most great cases from 1965 through his death in 1997. This is a MUST READ for any aspiring laweyer and certainly a boost to a practicing lawyer. One of my lifetime 10 best books.Milken, the Contra-Ran Scandal, Atticca Riots,...he was the man there."
3,Uninspired,"Morgan's book does a fair job at sharing his thoughts on theater lighting design and technology, but it is really not much fun to read. It reads like a textbook, yet is not thorough enough to be used as one. Beginners: this will not hook you. Others: you don't need this. Note that this is by a British writer, and some information may not be accurate in the US or elsewhere.One last whine--Books like this need production photos!!! This is loaded with black and white photos of lekos and lightboards, and a handful of line drawings to demonstrate certain ideas, but not a single production photograph is to be found, with the exception of the rather poorly-lit (!) snapshot on the cover."
3,Good picture book,"Good picture book, some info. Lists operators upto time of print some info on development, but info is very limited."
2,Great for a short time,"This was very cute and I loved it. However, after about 2 weeks the upper edges came off when my toddler reached up on them and pulled. It left splintery edges where the screws had been. It was still functional so we sanded them down and kept using it. A few months later the drawers no longer opened and closed properly and it became wobbly and tightening the bolts didnt help. Overall, I think it is adorable, but I wish for the price that it had been better quality. If it was half the price I would have given it a better review - but the long term quality should have been better for such an expensive piece."
3,"Ok product, horrible directions!!","We finally got the changing table put together after 2 hours and while it does looks nice, it was the most difficult thing we have ever put together. The directions are not very clear and can be difficult to follow. We had to take some things apart and re-do them because the directions weren't specific enough. Also, the changing table is cheaply made--definitely not high quality. I also agree with another reviewer that it doesn't seem like the most stable changing table, the backing they give you is SUPER thin--I think we are going to go get a piece of thin plywood and attach that for stability. Having said all that, it does look very nice in our room! I just hope its sturdy enough to last!"
1,Pros/cons,-ProsSpacious-ConsThe color is more of a chocolate and not espressothe finish quality is poortable is not sturdy. my son bumped into it and almost knocked it down. Hes 34 lbs- I could not recommend this for someone that does not have a welder to add stability. After a month I had to keep it against a wall to keep it from falling over.
4,beautiful and solid for a great price,"we bought the south shore savanah changing table because it was not expensive and fit into our apt. It was delivered promptly nicely packaged. I am not handy and I knew that this would take me a long time to build but when i opened the box and saw the amount of parts i flipped, to make matters worse the instructions were so hard to figure out. I ended up hiring a handyman and it took him 2 hours and cost me $50. But after all that it was worth it. The changing table is beautiful and very sturdy it looks like a $400 piece. If your looking for a great changing table at a great price this is your best bet. (just be aware its frustrating to build)"
3,Good for the price,"We were missing a few screws and some of the pieces are very cheaply made. The drawer bottoms are cardboard. I don't expect this to last long, but it was such a good price I couldn't resist. It looks really nice and was easy for my husband to put together. I found some bins that fit perfectly in the open spaces so it has plenty of storage for diapers, wipes, etc."
5,Love this! Very pretty and nicely made,I love this. The wood color is awesome. Tons of pieces to put together but once its all together it looks great. Its very sturdy and not cheap looking at all. Love it.
3,Decent,"This product definitely looks nice, once it's put together. Putting it together was a challenge. It took my husband 4 hours to do it. He has never had such a hard time putting together furniture before! Some of the screws didn't want to screw in all the way, so my husband had to put extra screws just to make sure that it was sturdy. I'm not due until next month, so I'll have to see how well it works out with my baby. But it shouldn't be that hard to put together a piece of furniture!"
3,Good Product/Bad Shipping,"The product is very cute and goes well with our decoration. The only problem was when being shipped it was chipped and cracked in a couple places. We were able to glue the pieces on and you can hardly tell, but it is still frustrating when you pay money for something and it is not perfect. The item is very sturdy and all in all was a great choice as far as we can tell."
2,doesn t fit together,"the look is ok but to put it together is a real challenge. You ll need to buy smaller vis for the drawers nobs as the ones they give are too big. And a big advice, don t move it on a carpet or it will widen it and the drawers will fall down and you won t be able to put them back..."
3,Good piece of furniture for the price,"Happy with the product, though putting it together was a little daunting (took a couple of hours and careful examination of the instructions). On the finished product, some of the hardware (screw holes, etc) show in the shelves and on the top of the table. The changing table pad covers these up somewhat, and (perhaps) once the shelves are full, it won't be as noticable. The drawers are a little tight when opening and the knobs needed a fresh coat of paint. However, overall, good piece of furniture for the price."
4,cute changing table,"This changing table is adorable. Once the particle board is screwed into the back of it, it is much sturderier. It's a little smaller than I thought but fits very nicely in the nursery. Assembly was a little confusing but not that bad."
5,Great value. Nice peice of furniture for the price.,"I have no complaints about this piece. It arrived without damage, was easy to put together, and it looks great and works well. It is exactly what I expected. The only improvement I would make it using something more substantial for the drawer bottoms."
5,great gift,I purchased this as a gift. They love it. The cubby holes are quite large. It is very sturdy. The price was very good. I highly recommend this changing table/dresser
4,You get what you paid for,"This is a nice looking changing table, is not super sturdy but also does not look super cheap. It is what you would expect it to be for what you paid. On the down side, the instructions are not clear, and it is really easy to damage the board if you hammer really hard so be careful."
3,Hard to assemble!,"This is a cute changing table but SO many parts, screws, etc. It took forever to assemble. Now I just need to find baskets to fit in the 3 little openings which are about 10x10x18""."
5,awesome product,"Not too hard to put together. It is super sturdy, convenient and it looks really nice. I highly recommend it."
2,Savannah Changing Table,"This table is not very well made. It's all particle board. I think for the price, it should be real wood. One of the pieces was also damaged when we received it. It took about a week and a half to receive this item. Now we will be waiting at least another week for the replacement piece to come in. I am not impressed with this product."
1,Cute but cheaply made,"This dressing table, while cute at first has fallen apart on us after only 5 months of use. Very dissapointed in quality"
4,I love this little dresser.,"I was unsure when purchasing this dresser/changer if it would be tall enough for me and my husband based on the measurements, but it turned out to be perfect! The cubbies are nice for holding baskets for readily used items and the drawers are a nice size. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that some of the ways the drawers/tracks are constructed were very difficult to assemble. It took me about 3 hours to fully assemble start to finish and I am very mechanically inclined. Once put together, though, it's very sturdy. The finish seems easy to clean which is a bonus."
2,"Crappy, not sturdy","This piece of furniture is crappy. The material is fragile and it is thus no surprise it arrived damaged - edges, corners chipped off etc. I just realized how poor some parts are after discovering i had thrown away the backside board thinking it was packing material. The bottom of the drawers is particularly weak too.Also way too hard to put together for such a small item. The low price is no excuse here.I would not recommend buying this item, but i'll give it 2 rather than 1 star because of the nice looks..."
5,Exactly what we were looking for,"Did a lot of research looking for a small dresser/changing table combo as we are limited on space. It arrived about 1 week after ordering, packaged wonderfully, no broken pieces, and was put together smoothly in about 1 hour. Directions say not to use power tools, which my husband did, but we didn't run into any problems at all. The quality of pieces are slightly better than expected for the price, but I imagine anyone inexperienced in construction might find this assembly challenging. The drawers are good size for some baby clothes and the shelves are deep enough to hide a few things behind a cute basket to dress it up. Once assembled, it's a sturdy piece of furniture that will serve it's purpose and look cute for a great price! You won't find furniture priced like this at chain baby stores."
3,Time consuming to put together and some damage in delivery,"Thank goodness my husband is better at following written instructions than I am. He would bring them in to show them to me as he built the changing table so we could laugh at how unclear they were. It still took some time to build and all the while we found small chips in the changing table that probably occurred in the delivery/shipping process. Because it weighed like 80 pounds, we decided to putty and paint the chips rather than haul it back to the post office. It does look nice now, though, and was a good price."
1,junk,"This is a piece of junk. Arrived damaged UPS weighs 70 lbs and broke thru the cardboard. On assembly, product fell over and the fasteners broke thru the FLAKEBOARD which is not strong enuf to support the weight. Do not buy it as it is poorly engineered. I have photos."
1,Extremely disappointed,"Package came in a very bad shape, can basically see the contents from the torn plastic wraps. Two panels came cracked at the corners.Low quality hardware and PLASTIC drawer sliders (this is the first time I have seen plastic sliders). I have bought some furniture from Amazon and this is the worst experience by far."
2,south shore changetable,"this changetable may look cute, but the quality is not there. Everything is partical board. When nailing it together it can cause damage inside b/c it is partical board. I would not buy this changetable again."
1,Piece of Garbage,"My wife and I bought this product because we thought it looked good and would fit well in our soon-to-be daughters room. After 5+ hours of assembly, I wish that we would have never made this purchase. The instructions are HORRIBLE and many of the pieces that we received had damage to them. I work with tools for a living and have assembled many different pieces of furniture before and I have never had such a difficult time as I did with this. The pieces didn't fit right at all and whenever you screw something in tightly, you can hear the cheap particle board start to crack. Even when I FINALLY finished, the table was a little bit wobbly and just doesn't look right. Oh well, you live and learn I guess."
3,"Pretty, but not best quality",Very cute changing table but not the best quality. Already showing signs of wear on bottom edges from moving it across the room. Drawers slide great and has plenty of storage.
1,what a mess,"i am giving this a one star review because received damaged materials, i do not know if it happened in shipping or prior but 2 largest pieces, the top where you put the baby down and one side were delivered cracked. it is still usable and i am too pregnant and stresses enough already to have to deal with complaints and unscrewing parts we already put together, packaging everything and sending it back only to wait for it again, specially because of the circumstances i have, i need it done in couple of days.reading through some other reviews i see i am not the only one. this is not a $10 item or something it's easily shipped back and forth, and they sure do charge enough for shipping, so it should come to our homes in one piece and undamaged.i'm really disappointed and know i will NOT buy items like this through amazon again or online for that matter.i will be posting pictures of the damage too under customer photos once i download them!"
4,Great value,We received this changing table as a gift. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy. It fits everything we need to diaper on a daily basis.
1,Poor Quality/Difficult to Assemble,"I purchased this for my second baby, so I have had experience in assembling baby furniture. This was an absolute nightmare to assemble! NOT sturdy enough that I would actually place my infant on it!"
4,Does the job!,"Yes, this is a particle board, assemble-yourself piece of furniture, but it is a great option for the price!Things I like:-Cubbies AND drawers!-The changing table is surrounded on all four sides to hold the pad in place.-As long as you put it together correctly, it is sturdy.What I don't like is the knobs. They look like they could of used another coat of white paint. So I simply went to Lowes and purchased four new knobs with a nice pattern on them... they add a nice touch :)"
2,"Great Price, cheaply made",I have this dresser and it has gone through some retrofitting. My father in law had to fix the drawers because they kept popping out of place so he reinforced them. They are okay now but I'm not completely happy with the construction. The paint has shipped in the front of the dresser as well. You get what you pay for.
1,price is too good to be true!,"I had 4 of these sent to me because they kept arriving damaged. After finally accepting that it was not going to arrive in one piece I called South Shore and had the specific parts that were damaged sent. They have horrible customer service but that really has nothing to do with the review of the product so I won't go deeper into that. My wife and I like the ""look"" of this product and love the price. Obviously it is cheaply made and packaged for delivery very poorly. I had to drill a few holes and use my own screws for this product but when you weigh the price of this product versus others, it is still worth the headache, just don't expect to be getting a great deal on a fantastically crafted piece of furniture and prepared to have to wait for replacement parts to arrive."
4,"attractive and affordable but ""some"" assembly required","We really like the look and performance, but the material is just so so, and assembly was a 2 hour ordeal."
4,Nice and sturdy changing table,"This changing table looks in person like it does in the picture. Not very difficult to assemble, it just requires patience. Would recommend to others."
3,"fair price, fair piece of furniture","I was looking for a relatively inexpensive changing table because I knew that it wouldn't become a permanent piece of furniture. This piece was the right look at the right price.It took me two attempts to get this delivered. The first one got lost or damaged by UPS. But after calling Amazon, they shipped a new one right away.There were 26 steps and an incredible amount of components to assemble in this piece. The instructions were pretty clear - with one or two exceptions, but the construction took me several hours (4-5 in total; completed in a couple sittings). The drawers required two people to put together - one to hold while the other uses the screwdriver. The quality is OK...not fantastic.All in all, I'd say it's a fair price for a fair piece of furniture. My baby isn't due until May so no comment on how it works functionally yet, but now that it's put together it looks like it will be relatively sturdy."
3,Nice looking chnging table,"This changing table is very nice looking. It was a pain to put together but, my biggest complaint is that the drawer runners are plastic. I understand you get what you pay for but, even at discount retailers the actual runners are metal. Other than that, it is exactly what was expected and will be a great short term piece."
2,like my other changer much better,"My mother bought this when my son and I came to stay for 2 months while my husband was deployed. The materials are cheap and the paint chips easily. The table has never seemed very stable and while it's very attractive the instructions are hard to follow due to the number of different screws, etc. I have and Athena changer in my nursery in California that is solid wood and I like that so much better. Overall very pretty, but not well made."
3,Good Changing Table with Storage,"We liked the overall design of this changing table. What you get in the box is bunch of wooden pieces and screws and nails. Plan to spend a good number of hours to assemble this together. Luckily we didn't make any mistakes while putting this together. There are chances for something going wrong and having to redo things.It took longer than expected to arrive. I ordered a bunch of items every couple of days for a week and even though this was the first item I ordered, it was one of the last items to arrive.It looks sturdy. Will provide more updates as we start using it."
4,Great dresser,"I got this dresser/changer to match the Graco Charleston crib and they go together fabulously. It was a big job to put together, but it looks great. The only thing is that once we inserted the drawers, they didn't seem to be centered. It doesn't bother me too much, though."
