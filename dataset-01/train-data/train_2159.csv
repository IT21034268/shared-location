3,Decent headphones,"For the price, the headphones are fairly decent. They feel comfortable and I have no issue with them falling out.The sound is nothing to write home about. For the price, the sound is pretty decent. I bought these after losing my Sennheiser headphones and the difference was very harsh to my ears. My previous headphones had a very nice neutral sound, which I preferred.Another reviewer mentioned that they barely leak sound. I don't know if it's just because of my small ears, but my friends could definitely hear sound and I don't play it too loud."
4,Does what it is supposed to,These are workout headphones and should be evaluated as such. They will not replace a good expensive pair for listening to music for long periods of time. The sound quality is about as good as the standard iPod headphones but these fit nicely into my ears and stay in place while working out. For $8 you get what you pay for and this product does exactly what it says it will. I would defiantly buy this product again and the price is fair
4,Very good ones for sports,"I bought this headphones especially for jogging, anda i have to say: work great for that, are very comfortable and lightweight ien"
2,It works.....,"Sound is poor at best, and they don't stay up in your ear, as a gym rat who wears a head band it it both disappointing but fixable with a head band."
2,Not good for running/gym,"The clip part of these is very large, and are constantly falling off. Also, the way the speakers are designed, the sound can be heard by people around me. I would not purchase these again."
2,Won't stay on ears.,I was so excited to get these. I love the color but otherwise BIG disappointment! They will not stay on my ears at all. The only way I was able to use them was to turn the volume all the way up and hook the ear piece on my shirt. Even then they had to be readjusted often and where difficult to hear. I would not recommend these.
2,Sound is good - doesn't stay put,"The sound is really good. However, the ear buds didn't stay put when I ran or walked. Wouldn't recommend anyone to buy them for exercising."
5,Comfortable,"Regular earbuds hurt my ears and fall out easily. These fit my ear very comfortably. Other than that, they are no-frills."
3,Sony MDR J10h.ear Headphones,Below average sound quality. Ear clips great for working out on a treadmill. Hard to hear when answering your phone with an iphone.
1,In Stock? I DON'T THINK SO!,"I purchased this product...twice. The first time, after it didn't arrive, I contacted Brainstorm corporation and they told me it was out of stock. They refunded my money. A couple weeks later I found it on Amazon under what I thought was a different seller. Turned out is was Brainstorm again...and once again, after contacting them, they informed me it was out of stock and refunded my money. Why do they continue to list it here as IN STOCK? Look at the reviews. The last one before mine is from 2007!"
1,Never. EVER,"LISTEN!DONT EVER EVER BUY THESE.I dont care how cheap SONY offers them for -- i have bought 2 pairs of these to wear while at work -- and in both instances, used or new --- the headphones send shocks into your ear lobes randomly.these are VERY DANGEROUS. SONY has refused to respond to my complaints for them.Do Not. Buy."
1,Shockingly bad,"After about two weeks owning these, they started shocking me when I would run. Maybe I'm especially sweaty, but these are supposed to be sporty headphones, right?Anyway, I threw them away. Thankfully it wasn't much money wasted."
2,Failed after a couple of months,"I orginally bought a pair of these earphones from Walmart. For about a year, the earphones were working fine no problems. The design was good and so was the fit. The downside was a couple of days, when I decided to go to the gym I noticed the sound was coming out from only one side. I thought it was problem with my itouch but I plugged in my other headhpones and sound came out from both sides. I'll stay away from buying these earphones again."
5,Overall: Worth every cent!,These ear buds are very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is very impressive.
5,Great for Workouts,"These ear phones are excellent in every way. The ear clips make them perfect for jogging and working out--they never come off. I replaced an older pair of the same earplugs. It seems the little wires wear out with multiple years of use. But, at this price, who can complain."
2,Great for running ... if you don't care about music,"The Good: Sony MDR-J10 Ear Headphones are comfortable (to me) and stay put while running. The cord length is generous, for example if you clip the player to your waist belt.The Not So Good: The wires are thin compared to the iPod ear buds, but they are standard for typical ear phones in this price range.The Ugly: The sound of these ear phones is extremely thin and tinny. There is little to no bass or treble. The range that is emphasized is the upper midrange.Previously I bought the Panasonic RP-HV094 Simple Ear Buds from Amazon. The price today is less than half the Sony MDR-J10 but the sound is more than twice as good. They don't fit over the ear, but they stay in place when I run. I'm pretty sure the Sony MDR-E818LP ear buds that I bought from Amazon years ago were way better, too.In short, the MDR-J10 is a comfortable design with lousy sound."
1,"Uncomfortable, hard to use, too big!!",1. I could barely get them on my ears without stretching them2. Once I got them on they hurt3. They were extremely uncomfortable4. They were way too big around my ears5. The earpiece wouldn't fit in my ear6. The design is awkward and doesn't allow for good sound.Think twice before ordering these headphones.
1,I do not recommend,"These are totally uncomfortable, slip right off the ear, and/or out of the ear with the slightest head movement, and due to the ""open air design"" you can barely hear any audio that are supposed to be coming from them. Horrible purchase that I immediately returned."
4,"not spectacular, but they do the job","I bought these to use while running because I found my iPod headphones needed to keep being adjusted. As with all earbud type headphones they don't fit everyone perfectly. I'm not sure how to rate my ear size, but I found they didn't fit well over the tops of my ear - the plastic stuck up a little - so that when I went to brush my hair behind my ears the buds fell out. Besides that I've found them to work fairly well although it should be noted that you cannot sprint with them in. The sound is of adequate quality and I like how the speaker is facing towards your ear cannal."
3,I like them.,"I was surprised that I would, considering they're somewhat awkward to put on, but they don't hurt my ears, for which I'm grateful."
3,Kinda Large,Looking for something a bit more secure then buds. These work but they are a bit large around my ears.
2,Left speaker not working in 4 months,I purchased the product in March 2010. I was regularly running with this headphone connected to my ipod for 4 months. My left headphone has stopped now stopped working. It's comfortable but not to be used for work-outs.
2,Great sport earphones - for the 4th time,"I've tried many different types of over the ear head phones (JVC, Panasonic, etc) but the ones I like the most are these Sony earphones. But...like another reviewer said, the left earbud ALWAYS fails on me. Most of them last around a year at the most and the left side always just shuts down.These are very comfy and fit snugly in your ear. It also doesn't pop out when you go running so that's why I like them. Some other ones (Panasonic in-ear) always pops out and I end up not wearing them anyways.Even though this is the best sport ear phones I've had - it's also the worst because of something faulty with it in itself - the left earbud. I'm not sure why this happens but it is always the same thing over and over again."
5,best inexpensive ear plugs that I wear all day,These are my 3rd pair of plugs and they last longer than others in this price range and are comfortable to wear allday.
3,Ok,The earphones provide adequate sound quality for the price but they do still slip off my ears when running. I was hoping for more.
4,"Good pair for the price, but not for me!","Overall the headphones were pretty good sound quality for they're price, plus their quite comfortable and good for working out. The only reason why I rated it 4 stars was because they didn't,t fit ""my ears"", mine are too small but I gave them to my brother and it firs him perfectly, overall a good purchase."
5,Never had a Problem,I've honestly never had a problem they have been wet stepped on and pretty much had everything happen to them sadly the vacuum destroyed them when they were on the floor and got run over because of the vacuum blades other then that i love them would recommend then to anyoneSony MDR-J10 H.Ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Blue)
5,good stuff,5th pair i've had over the years.....i have a messed up ear so these are the only ones I can use (besides over the ear ones). Only reason have to buy more is that I'm not very nice to them lol. They are cheap and work well. Most pairs last me at least a year....would last longer if you were nice to them. Good product.
5,woman's ears friendly,"This item was purchased as replacement for a cell phone, the headphones sound great!, they are priced right, funny that the same items retails locally at 2x the amazon.com price.These earphones have and ear ""hook"" deal that clips them to your ear and they stay on put, furthermore, the actual speaker sits just outside of your ear, perfectly placed to be able to listen to crisp clear quality sound, they do not hurt the ears as regular ""in-ear"" headphones do over just little time of having them on, as they will be used by my significant other, they needed to be super comfortable, and the feedback I got is, that they are, on small ears, tried them on myself and could confirm both the sound quality and the comfort.Overall, higly recommend, great price/ great sound/ ultra comfortable... and you don't even need to drive to the store to pick them up!"
3,Static,"Decent headphones for a good price. My biggest problem with these is that at high volumes, there is a noticeable static sound which can get annoying."
3,Sony MDR-J10 h. Ear Headphone with Non-Slip,Sound quality is the best. I use them for when I exercise. I have found that after a month or so one side goes out (meaning I'm listening with one ear). I use them for my outside exercise so that can be a good thing. Just depends on how you look at it. Stereo sound quality regardless of one ear or two.
2,Wasted Money...,"Sounds very good, but, does not sit snug at all! Any movement will create a loose fit. I ended up using the crappy ear buds from my sansa clip to the gym instead of these...sad:("
2,"Good sound, but physically painful","I have a similar pair that are great. I bought these to have something at work. Big mistake. The sound is good, but the earhooks pinch my ears and I cannot wear them for more than a few minutes. I am chucking them and looking for something else. Sony, what were you thinking?"
4,Well worth the money,I bought two of these maybe 2 years ago and one pair just went bad (sound only coming out one side)... but for the $9 each I paid... come on... I got my money's worth.Most important is the sound quality and it's very good...not fantastic... it's more on the brassy side... but I got used to it and again... it was less than $10.The over the ear design works fine... never have a problem with them falling out.For those of you complaining about the color not being exactly what you expected... come on... are you kidding? I was expected a kiwi green and this is more of a guacamole...hahaha LMAO.
4,Decent for jogging & great for the price,"The headphones don't fit as snugly in my ear as I would like, but don't slip out like earbuds do while jogging. Pretty decent sound."
4,Decent,"For the price I paid for them, these headphones are decent. I will probably pull the left headphone wire out eventually and have to buy a new pair in some number months. But for cheap under $10 headphones, these are great for everyday use and for me, going to the gym."
2,I know I'm not color blind,"These were a gift for my husband - I chose green because it's the color of his Alma Mater, where he now works - and I PAID MORE FOR THE GREEN (the blue earbuds were less expensive). Well, like many other reviwers mentioned - THEY ARE BLACK. I would have considered other earbud options if color weren't an issue."
4,Sony earphones,"The earphones work just fine. They deliver nice sound and are much more comfortable than regular earbuds. However, they are black, not green!! It doesn't change their sound quality, but it's not what I ordered."
4,Very good.,"I've had these for 2 years or so and really like them. I bought them expressly to wear while running (and other exercise, but mostly running).I find them to be very comfortable (I'm a 6'0 male, so I'd imagine my ears are on the big side)and they sound really good for a 10 dollar pair of earbuds. Obviously not something that's going to put out Hifi sound. My only complaint is that the cord has a tendency to tangle up and get caught on things. This is what broke my current pair and brought up my search for a new one."
2,OK.,"these are ok for wrap arounds. They hurt my ears though, the bud could be a little smaller. I like the way they are angled in, that is nice. But if I wear them to long my ears start to hurt."
1,No durability,"I got these headphones mid-Feb and they broke today (no sound from one channel). I've owned the same headphones before and ran into the exact same problem, but never so early into usage. I only bought them again because I liked the fit (but I can imagine that this type of headphone would be uncomfortable for some ear shapes). I don't subject my headphones to harsh wear and tear, so there's no reason for these to break except for a manufacturing defect, which I suspect all MDR-J10's probably have. Don't buy these if you are looking for headphones that last more than 2 months."
3,Decent earphones,Everything is good. I just bought my second pair. The only main concern is that it doesn't last long enough. One of the ear buds went bad after 3-4 months of use and then the right stopped working. If you need something that lasts no more than 6 months this may be a good choice.
3,You get what you paid for I guess.,"They sound ok, but I don't know if my ears are just too small or what, but they don't stay in my ear very well. They just sort of hang there over my ears, but don't really fit inside me ears and stay put. I don't think there is anything wrong with the product, but they just don't work very well for me. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with small ears."
2,Sizing issue,This product is ok if your not moving but I wanted headphones that i could run in and these constantly fall off of my ear because the gap in the hook is too big. I have medium sized ears and these are for people with big ears.
4,Efficient headphones for my smartphone,"Good quality, nice sound. The only drawback is that the wires have a tendency to get tangled."
1,Dissappointed,"I was very dissappointed in these headphones. They don't fit around my ears right. One of them seems to curl around different than the other, but I can't tell the difference in the curvature just by looking at them. I tried to wear them while working out, but they fell off after about 5 seconds."
4,Good while they last,"I'll try to keep it short and sweet:Pretty good sound. Not a lot of bass, but I wasn't really expecting that. Cord is a little short, but it's not so short that I would lower the rating. The only problem I have is that I've now had 3 pairs of these, and one ear keeps shorting out. Not sure why..."
2,Difficult to wear comfortably,"This is not a terrible headset for someone using them without much activity. I purchased them to use while running and they simply do not stay in place. Its really annoying when you can't make it through a single verse in a song without adjusting them. If I leave them unadjusted, they simply fall off. They are not adjustable by any means and just aren't meant for the daily runner."
3,Not much bass response,"They work, they fit great, and the price was right. Not much bass response, which creates an experience of mid range and treble. Probably a great product if you're listening to audio books or podcasts, but for music I would recommend locating another product."
1,Way too big for my ears,"I am a petite person (5' 1"") and the headphones did not fit on my ears at all."
2,Doesn't fit very well,"I wanted a pair of earbuds that would not directly fit in my ear canal. The earbuds sit snugly but not completely into my ear. The one major problem that I have is that the rest of the ear piece does not fit around my ear. If you have small ears these will not work! I like the fact the earbud sits just outside the ear canal but, it's too bad that the ear pieces aren't adjustable."
3,Definitely good one for its price range.....,I started searching for a sports headphone after I broke the earlier one in just two weeks. So I was not looking for an expensive one. This product is worth its money. The design is a bit different from my earlier headphone but it solves the purpose. The speakers are not pushed into the ears rather are placed a bit sideways which is quite comfortable. I liked it.
2,less than expected,From all the great reviews I was so excited to receive these in the mail. Having an older pair of over the ear headphones I was expecting a major improvement. The headphones are of great quality in construction and looks. They do stay in the ear well whilst running. For me they really fell short in the most important sound department. They are distinctly tinny in their sound reproduction. I had to turn the bass way up to get an acceptable sound overall sound. I hope they loosen up as I use them more but I may be going back to my old pair. These were a disappointment for me.
3,Great sound. Poor durability.,"Like another Amazoner wrote, I have had at least 3 of these things. My first pair I lost and the second pair, the left earbud stopped working. My last pair which just recently died, the little metal part fell off the right ear phone and it stopped working. The sound is great and I really like the feel of them on my ear but if you are looking to have them for an extended period time, don't. They usually last about 6 months or so. If you decide to buy it, get the warranty because they will break most times through no fault of yours. If the durability was as good as the sound, what a wonderful thing it would be."
2,ear phones,"After 7 months and perhaps 200 hrs of use the left ear piece failed. The right one failed failed in the 10th month. This was the 1st set I have ownned that completely failed without accidental damage. I did Like wearing them, but will not buy again."
3,OK headpones,"These are just ok. Not thrilled with the sound of these or the comfort. I bought a couple of headsets and I found another one I like better for comfort and sound. These are not too good in a noisy gym, I need something that goes over the ears and blocks out some of the ambient noise. May be ok for at work or home."
3,Not a bad little pair of headphones.,"No issues. They do what they spec. Use them at my desk. Have not used while walking yet, but sure they will do fine."
3,3.5 Stars,"First off, the color that is shown in the main picture is kind of misleading. The headphones are a darker blue. Anyways, on to the quality. I probably buy 5 to 6 pair of headphones per year just because I like to see which brands have the best sound. I've had headphones that were expensive and some that were not. With this specific pair of headphones, you basically get what you paid for. A decent sound that is not too rich, not really heavy on bass, and manages to keep most outside noise to a mininum (be careful if you're a runner or walk the streets period). Me personally, the headphones do not bang loud enough but that is just preference. I do like the minimized sound leakage feature though. Oh, also, the fit can be kind of annoying at sometimes to where you have to continously adjust the headphones to your liking but once you get them set, they're okay."
2,good sound but...,"I must admit, these headphones are very comfortable and have terrific sound for the price. My problem with these is a big one. I live in minnesota and in the winter the air is very dry. In the wintern these headphones will shock you. They will literally zap the inside of your ear. This is annoying and slightly painful. The even bigger problem is that when they shock you the electricity goes into your music player. These headphones caused by 250$ mp3 player to freeze. If your willing to risk it than go ahead but i feel people should be warned."
2,these are cheap for a reason,I bought these because of the over ear design. They were cheap so i gave it a shot. The sound quality is horrible. Cheap earphones will sound like cheap earphones. There's also slight hiss coming from the earphones even when the music is paused. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Flimsy!,"I bought these with the intention of replacing my iPhone earbuds for use at the gym. The iPhone earbuds just didn't fit me and would constantly fall out when running on the treadmill. I purchased these Sony headphones because they were inexpensive.I found them to be made of hard plastic that had rough edges. I could feel them scraping my ear, especially when running hard. They didn't really stay in place. They are vertically stabilized so they don't fall off of your ear, but there is nothing really keeping them horizontally in place and sticking in your ear so you can hear them. Also, the audio quality isn't the greatest and as you turn up the volume the sound becomes distorted.After 2 weeks of gym usage (1 or 2 hours a day, 5 days a week) the left earbud stopped working. I ended up just throwing them away. It wasn't worth pursuing a warranty claim on something so inexpensive. I went with the over-the-ear earbuds from Philips and I was much happier!"
2,Not so much,The sound in these ear phones are exceptional. The only problem is that they do not fit right in my ears so I cannot fully enjoy the high quality of sound. I tried to put them on as many different ways and they just didn't feel or look right. Pity.
4,good for work,my glasses fit on my ear with this headphone and I can still hear because they do not sit in the ear canal.
2,"Good fit and sound quality, but lacks durability","I must have gone through 7 or 8 pairs of this model in the past couple of years, and am done with them. There is a clear manufacturing defect. I guess I kept replacing them because I got them for cheap and they were usually the lightest-weight most compact headphone sports headphones that would fit.The problem I ran into was always the same. After a couple of months (maybe a max of 6) of consistent use, mainly for working out, one earbud would invariably short out. Either the sound would cut off completely or I would get intermittent sound. Often by adjusting the position of the wire, the sound would be restored, but only if I kept the wire in a certain position manually. Having only one headphone working out of two, although annoying, was acceptable for my purposes. Usually, however, the other the headphone would quickly follow suit, rendering the product useless."
2,"New purchase, but already regretting it","I've been using this product for about two days now and already I regret it. My biggest issue is with the comfortability of the headphones. The portion that goes over the ear is fine, but it's the actual earbuds that are killing my ears (one side more than the other, so maybe my ears are shaped funny?). I wouldn't recommend these for anyone with small ears like me. Also, the sound quality is only ok. There's virtually no bass, and the volume output seems moderately low on these. I get better sound quality and comfort from my clip-on earphones from 5+ years ago. I bought these in green, hoping they would be a bright green color, but it's more of a sage green. If you don't have a problem with earbuds, these would probably work for you."
1,lousy sound,these headphone had a horrible sound and no bass and not comfortable in the ear.But what did i expect for 7.99.
4,Good Value!,"I am pretty surprised how well these work for how in-expensive they are. I have smaller ears and they still fit very well. I have heard that they break easy, but mine have been fine. Though, the interesting thing is how much the price varies depending on the color you want! I consider myself thrifty, but not thrifty enough to purchase the pink ones to save a couple bucks!"
2,too big,maybe i have a small head.. i dont know. but these are ill fitting. glad mamazon gave me a refund.
5,Sony headphones are very nice.,"These headphones stay in place, and have good sound. I wish they could be a bit softer, like rubby plastic instead of the hard plastic."
2,Tinny and no base,"I have been using the Sony MDR-J10 for at LEAST a decade. I have owned many many pairs of them. They go by the wayside in typical ways. Kids break them, earphones short out, cord gets caught on something and gets yanked out of the bottom, etc...This pair of green ones that I just got are so tinny and have so little base, that they sound like a pair of .50 cent headphones instead of a pair of $10 headphones.I don't have high requirements for headphones and I don't expect the world from a $10 pair, but these are significantly worse than they use to be.I have an old pair here at work where the right ear has shorted out after a pretty long time. When I compare the two listening to Alan Parson's Jigue, there is a clear quality difference.I'm very disappointed."
2,not good for folks with little ears,The sound was okay but I couldn't keep the things on my ears! They clear the top of my ear by nearly a half inch and keep falling off. I won't skimp on headphones next time...
1,"Good while they last, which is never for long","I too have had the same annoying experience as most of the other ""one starers"". And I keep buying them again anyway. They are ideal while they last. They are the most comfortable, best sound (for $10 earphones), and they are the only compact earphones that stay on my ears. Within six months the left one starts to short out. I wish I could find some similar earphones that lasted, but I haven't been able to do so."
4,Nice headphones,"Overall,these headphones are good.The sound quality is great but it does slip sometime when used for jogging and running.I suggest you should try it first how it fits around your ear if you need it for that purpose."
2,"Ehhh, they're ok","These headphones fit very well on my head, and the sound is good. But, mine keep dying on me (I'm now on my third pair in a year), so if you're looking for a long lasting set of headphones, you've come to the wrong place! The bass is ok in these, but it's not the greatest."
1,Orange you glad?,"I agree with the assessment of the original reviewer and I believe that this is a heinous crime against Tic Tac lovers across the world. The second reviewer is obviously not a true fanatic and will bend to the will of the corporate America. We will not stand for pre-sucked Tic Tacs, no matter their supposed creed, white is NOT what they should start out as. This is an outrage, and I, for one, will not stand for it.PS.) Walmart does not carry mega Tic Tac packs and they suck(but not pre-suck), too."
1,Warning- Duplicate Album,"I only recently discovered this band. I like it well enough that I ordered the entire catalog. Great band.The problem is that every song on this album is also on Re""jive""inated. Buy it instead, it has all this album plus four more songs."
2,NOT WARM ENOUGH FOR WINTER,"I thought from the description and pictures that this hoody was going to be warm enough to wear in winter. I live in MN where the temperature gets cold. I need a hoody that layers well, and keeps it warmth. This item fell short of my expectation."
5,This stuff is great,"I tried DenTek Temparin Max first, which was completely worthless for crown repair. The crown would pop off if I ate scrambled eggs, or rice, or grapefruit, or anything really. Kinda ridiculous. I tried different amounts and application variations about 6 times to see if it was user error, but Temparin Max is just a crappy product.After my Temparin ordeal I picked up some Recapit at RiteAid and gave it a go, and it's freakin' AWESOME!!! I've chewed eggs, hard granola, pecans, rice, fruit, etc. etc., and it's all ""BRING IT ON FOOD!!!! I'LL TAKE YOU DOWN, BITCHES!!! >:O"" I am thoroughly impressed with this product and would toooootally recommend it. :)"
1,Does not work,Used it and the next day tooth fell off when I sneezed! Do not waste your money on this product!
2,not useful for maryland bridge,"A quick FYI. I was hoping this would be an adequate over-the-counter temporary cement for a maryland bridge that had come out (after ~10 years). It was not. Though I attempted to follow the directions carefully, the bridge never stayed in place for more than a few hours. It is not advertised as a cement for this purpose, but does mention bridge replacement in its instructions."
1,Do NOT buy Recapit it DOES NOT WORK,Sorry Recapit does not work. I tried it twice following the instructions. It lasted 5 minutes and 7 minutes each time. It tastes terrible. I didnt even chew on it. Dont bother.
1,"may be my crown,,,,","this didn't work for me, maybe it was my crown, had to have it reinstalled at the dentists office and it took some effort on his part to make it work."
4,So far my crown has remained in place,"I was flossing my teeth and a crown on a back molar popped off. I bought this product and recemented the crown back on about three days ago. My crown is staying on so far and not moving around at all. I am pleased with this product but it's too soon to tell how long the cement will hold. The instructions were easy to follow and the cementing process not difficult. The shipping was very fast, which was a plus as I wanted to get the crown stabilized ASAP after it came out. I would recommend trying this product."
1,May as well use toothpaste,"This product just doesn't hold in a cap as it never dries sufficiently or even gets sticky. It's totally useless and although it cost only a little, my delivery costs were high. Very disappointed."
1,Worthless,"Followed all the directions, it didn't work at all. It had about the same holding ability as if I mixed a bit of flour and water together to make a paste and tried to use that instead."
4,good but can be better,"nicely formatted book, pictures, menus and recipes nice features....but big drawback is not enough lisitngs...both on the restuarant side and especially hotels...numerous major Manhattan hotels not in the book...also many well-known restaurants in NYC not in book either....while reviews aree helpful. Michelin is not Zagat and it shows.....despite a nice effort, in form the Michelin guide is slicker than Zagat, but in terms of news you can use....Zagat is still number 1.....try harder Michelin"
1,Nearly useless,"This guide will only serve you well if your sole interest is French cuisine. Il Mulino, perhaps the finest Italian restaurant in the city, receives no stars. Peter Luger, arguable the best steakhouse in the word, receives a single star. The ""more"" ethnic, the less likely this guide is to have something nice to say. For example, I didn't see a single sushi place that received a star. Meanwhile, dozens of French restaurants that most New Yorkers wouldn't dine at unless they live on the same block are given 2 stars.Sure, tastes differ. These ratings, however, are not at all in line with the preferences of most New Yorkers, myself, or my many out of town friends (including some who are French) who have dined in NYC.The only positive thing I have to say is that the book is well put together and pleasing to look at with its color photographs."
2,"Playing is outstanding, unfortunately you can't hear!","For those you of eagerly seeking recordings that validate the incredible Miles concerts of the late 80s, you might want to pass up on this one. The mixing is so bad. Adam's keyboards, which are often used to fill in the sound, are so prominent you can barely hear Kenny (sax) Daryl (bass) or Ricky (drums). I am telling you, the mixing really sucks. Obviously an amatuer production. Stick to Live Around the World until the rest gets released."
2,Straight from the board,"The audio quality is quite bad, as mentioned by the preceding reviewer.For those willing to put up with a ""board"" mix (ie, a recording made straight from the FOH mixing board's outputs) this might be an acceptable trade-off, considering the material played here is unpolished, musically (not just sonically) speaking, and thus presents us with a fresh perspective from which to rediscover unexplored nooks and cranies in the standard repertoire of the last Miles Davis touring band.The solid performance from said band is the saving grace for this ""Live by Miles Davis"" CD (or whatever the actual name of it is, or ought to be).Bottom line: not just for die-hard fans and musicians, but pretty close."
4,Corruption in high places is there anything more intriguing?,"Once again, Margaret Truman has shared her intimate knowledge of Washington, D. C., governmental politics, and international diplomacy create a credible additional to her spectular crime series. The dialog is real and the story moves along swiftly because of it. This is a mystery that mystery lovers should enjoy."
4,"Gossip-filled, volcanic, tour de force.","This book is loaded with dirt on the presidents...some of it may be true, some not. Judge for yourself."
2,More of the Same,"Kessler really wants to be a hard-hitting reporter; he takes on the government at every chance he gets, the CIA, the FBI and now the President. Unfortunately with this book he tended to pick the low hanging fruit and gave us more of the same old stuff, the ""shocking but true"" and the ""they don't want you to find out"" info. He rattles off some well-used stories about many of the last holders of the office meant to show that power corrupts etc. The only thing I found new was some of the descriptions of the everyday employees of the White House and their daily jobs. Overall this is an average book. I would suggest the better book would be ""Shadow"" by Woodward - not the best but an improvement over this book."
2,"Just a bad, bad book.",This one isn't worth your time. It's pumped full out of hot air and is totally dated besides.
2,"Interesting, but untrustworthy","This book keeps your attention, but the section on Clinton is so overtly biased that it calls in to question everything else in the book. Not only is it extremely slanted, but the author spends a disproportionate amount of time picking apart Clinton regardless of what he does, and commenting on his policy. Also, interestingly, the author paints an overwhelmingly bad picture of the democratic presidents since Johnson, and a generally favorable picture of the republican presidents in such a consistent and emphatic way that it seems unlikely that it is really accurate, particularly once he gets going on Clinton.I was completely loving this book until I heard the way he treated Clinton, and it became very clear that the author had his own agenda, which was much more important that a fair presentation of life inside the white house. Worth reading, but not worth spending money on."
1,Writer places sensationalism over facts,"IF you're interested in a poorly edited, gossip-filled, unreferenced, non-sourced book, then this is for you. Kessler drops innuendos and rumors throughout the pages, with very few sources or substantiation given.The choppy editing is embarrassing. Whole sections appear to be out of place, relating to items that had been mentioned pages before or have yet to be dealt with.This kind of book is a scary and dangerous thing."
3,"Don't bother me, I'm showering off this book...","...Sleazy? Yes. Entertaining? Yes, to a point. Many flawed men have served as president, but many of Kessler's sources come off as bitter and possibly unreliable. I wish some of these bubble headed secretaries Johnson slept with would come forward...other than that, I think this is just a nonfiction potboiler that Harold Robbins or Jacqueline Susann would have written. Note to future presidents: try to be nice to the help and just have sex with your wives or husbands, end rumor mongering and run the country."
3,"Sometimes brilliant, sometimes shocking, sometimes lame","What is evident is the criminal behavior of the slime buckets we elect as President. Every occupant of the White House seems to out do the previous resident for wasting our money and heightening their ""kingdom"". Lots of good information scattered about, but Kessler must have run out of gas way before he had a complete book."
1,A Real Letdown,"As someone who has read a few of Kessler's books and loved them, this one was a complete disaster. I only give it one star for the tiny tidbits of sparsely scattered real information in this book, but that's certainly not worth the amount of money I had to pay for it."
2,Disgraceful,"Rumors, innuendo, and speculation. Terrible editing and direction. This book is a mess. Thank goodness I got this off the bargain rack. Did Mr. Kessler work for the ""Washington Post"" or the ""National Enquirer""??"
3,wanted to give this a 5 rating,"i wanted to give this a 5 rating but after finishing it, you notice that carter and clinton are so much more picked apart than nixon, ford, regan and bush. the republicans are held, for the most part, in highter esteem than the democrats. i recommend this book still though."
3,I dont know what to say...,"This was a mistake of mine, I don't even own a VCR anymore. So i have not been able to watch the video so it is hard for me to give it any credit."
5,My koi love these,"What can I say, the koi love these. Good for hand feeding as well. They smell good-my son thought they were cereal ;)"
5,Pond fish treats,"These were a surprising find. I never knew they had ""treats"" for pond fish. We have Koi and several other types of fish and they really love the fruit flavored treats. They are a little large for some of the smaller fish, but I think they can also enjoy them once they soften up and the fish can take bites from them. They get excited when we give them these fruit treats."
3,For Better or for Worse,"While getting its message accross in a christain context, the acting in this movie was below average and the story line was very simple. It would have been better if the plot and characters were expanded, but with only fifty minutes of tape time, it is as best as you can get."
5,Hilarious,Atheists like myself will LOVE this movie. What funnier than an completely over the top downfall of someone just because they aren't an evangelical Christian! Seriously what kid gambles and are parties so sinful? Please the message is so absurd it serves as the best representation of the worst. The datedness and awfulness of it is the best part. Please watch this on the internet for FREE!
5,Good message,"A Christian teen version of ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Rich Christiano films make no attempt to hide the gospel message of Christ and all his works are recommended. This of course is directed towards teens but the message is applicable to any Christian struggling to find the worth of his testimony. Not a high budget film but the story compensates for where it lacks in other areas. Worth watching."
5,second glance the right stuff for tee Christian focus,This movie is a must see for all Christian teens. I went thru this in my life before the light of Jesus saved me from the destruction and near fatal car accident that was a result from the lifestyle that the main character in this movie gets rescued from as a result of the movie's plot. It is great to show to an older teen youth group.
4,Good for teens to watch,This has a good plot and a good conclusion with lots of lessons to be learned in between. It's good to see things from two different choices. Just goes to show things are not necessarily what they appear to be.
2,A slow mover...,"Don't waste your time/money on this sleeper. Very slow moving. Trite, shallow caricatures abound. Pablum peddling at every turn. A relief to see the credits roll.P.S. I love Forest Whittaker - I think he just needed to pay some bills with this..."
2,Ok,Watched this movie for a laugh but the laughs were few. Wife and I recognized some of the things in this movie from when we were engaged and getting married. Found this movie to lack something. Wasn't very funny and also didn't have what it takes to watch again.
2,"Dull, Forced Acting","I have to agree with the others who rated this movie low - I selected it because of Forest Whitaker - but his performance was forced and very sub-par; the story line was weak, overall a very forgetable film. Don't waste your time."
3,Not great but worth renting,Forest Whitaker is just amazing in anything and although this was a really different part for him it still works. It is true that it is still and not funny most of the time it is not a complete waste of money. Eventhough you know pretty much everything that will happen and how it will end its still a decent ride along the way. A nice date or family movie night movie. I really liked the chemistry between Regina King and Forest Whitaker they were probably the best thing about the movie.
3,Jazz Doll,The story was true to form as to how mixed marriage can cause families to act. Good humor.
4,lol,i love this movie. if i married a black man this is probly how my wedding will be because i'm half cuban half american so there would be some spanish music playing
5,Sweet,"I just really like this movie. Its funny. Some of the music is really great -- reminds me of my hey day in the 60s and 70s. Overall, a really good, clean, and fun movie."
5,Good and Funny,"This movie was a funny one to watch, Forrest did a great job playing a single dad with whoring issues.. if you have nothing to do and you are looking for a interesting but funny movie to watch this is one."
2,Another Wedding Love Company,"This movie is enjoyable but nothing too special to it. The most interesting is the blending and interaction between two cultures that often times clash. The cast does a good job of being believable and down to earth. However, this is just another wedding love comedy similar to those you'd find from Tyler Perry.The typical story arch where man and woman are in love and decide to get married. However, families are different so there is instant friction. Overcoming these barriers is a difficult task as everyone has doubts. At one moment, the wedding appears to be off but finally, its on again.Again, nothing special. You get some good laughs, you'll enjoy the acting. Nothing else."
2,Lame movie,could have been a great funnny movie but the directing was awful the two main actors had no chemistry and you could see that clearly. Wouldnt reccomend
2,A movie that tried to be funny and touching but wasn't,"I really like America Ferrera and Forest Whitaker and consider them both good actors, but I did not like this movie. It tried way too hard to be funny - and it missed the mark completely. I never laughed once during this film, and the scenes that were supposed to be ""touching"" were stale. I spent most of my time looking at my watch and waiting for the movie to end.Centering around the surprise, impending marriage between a nice Hispanic girl and an African-American soon-to-be doctor, the movie tries to expose the humor between the two cultures when they attempt to become family. The result is shallow characters, predictability, and stupid situations.I truly wanted this movie to be good, but the truth is I don't even think is worth paying to rent."
3,this was very entertaining. .,"My 19 year old daughter bought this movie around Thanksgiving 2011, I watched it with her and liked it. . .she's away at college, so I thought ""hmm better buy myself a copy"" -- I like Forest Whitaker and Regina King so it works for me!"
4,"For the price, great bargain.",Neat poster to hang up over my bed. Was hoping to get more motivation.Anyways it is a well-printed bargain poster. No defects in printing.
1,I never received the product,"In the past I have received products on time from Amazon but, now the service was poor and low quality. Also I don't think I would buy international items from Amazon again."
4,interesting,"I bought 2 copies, one for me, one for my bf who's in another state... it helped up both not feel alone in this... pretty good book, tho not great."
4,Hope that I am not alone,"This book helped to make me feel that I am not alone in my situation. I wish there was more information written on this subject. Until then, READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Not up to the task,"Unfortunately this book fails to provide much more than the most basic look at long term relationships through the authors eye. It's just not enough information to spend money on. If your serious about this topic I suggest ""How to survive a long-distance relationship by Shellie Vandevoorde. This book is written from a military spouse's perspective and has advice and meaningful applications as well a realistic look at this difficult reality which military families deal with all the time."
1,Needs More Facts,"This author made the book for the moneyStephen Blake made no serious effort to research, explore or provide insightful evidence about long distance relationships. No behavioral analysis or even guidance on what to do for those in this situation. (...)."
4,Rich characters,"Robin Hemley's gift is in the detail, the nuance and the subtlety. In ten pages, he can develop characters more rich and layered than many authors do in a whole novel. These stories are warm, inviting and quietly moving."
3,Pink unite?,"Has some good info, but it's awfully simplistic and a little outdated. For example, the exercises for strength training specific to hiking are extremely easy and won't go all that far in developing those muscle groups. Also, when it discusses hygiene and elimination, it doesn't cover newer products to aid in sanitary and convenient backpacking options. Perhaps it needs an occasional edition update? Still, I like the descriptions of what to pack and the best hiking gear for female anatomy. I definitely think you need a more comprehensive overview of backpacking, including wilderness survival info, but this book addresses quite a few of the things a woman might consider when backpacking. That said, I was mildly irritated about involving the kids--kind of seemed to imply this is a woman-specific concern. Do dad's not want to take their kids backpacking? I highly doubt that's true. Just seemed a little narrow."
5,"Men ,too, should buy this book","People learn in different ways. Oftimes, despite the best of intentions, lecturing, demonstrating, and explaining a theory, method or technique crosses the gender gap in ways not anticipated by the male partner. Buying this book for any female hiking partner - your wife, girlfriend, daughters, mother-in-law, etc. - will give them a concise tutorial, full of gender appropriate demonstrations that a man just could not have come up with.The stretching and strenthening section is excellent (for both sexes). The idea that what is appropriate to pack depends upon terrain, duration, and weather is also excellent.My only complaint is that the use of simple, non-pressurized alcohol stoves is neglected - - maybe in the next edition."
2,somewhat disappointed,"I was okay with the contents of the book until I got to the section about personal protection. The blunt statement is made that women backpackers should never carry a gun. I disagree with the author on this point. This is a personal choice that thank God, women are able to make for themselves in many areas of the USA. A small revolver is not very heavy, and if a woman is trained and can legally carry a firearm, it is very approriate for many hikes in this day in age."
4,Excellent book for a beginner,"As someone who is taking up backpacking again after 20 years, I found this book very valuable to update me on the changes in the gear, etc... It was very practical, especially the many tips from women hikers included throughout the book."
4,Stack it up!,"Love the game, love the colors of the dice! The black velvet bag to put the dice in is a nice touch and makes the game easy to put away when you are done. Because of the stack game having so many colors of dice, I have also used the dice for other games when I have had a group over for game night! Great purchase."
1,"DISGUSTING, SEXIST AND DEGRADING! THIS BELONGS IN THE TOILET","I truly hate this recording. There is nothing in creation to recommend it and I find it offensive, disgusting and sexist. It is not only an insult to women. This repulsive recording is an insult to anybody with a conscience and more than a modicum of intelligence. This has no redeeming features and the sound is horrendous. I'd rather hear JACKHAMMERS! Some beat! It is ruthless, relentless and just plain atonal and completely lacking in talent. What on earth would compel anybody to own this? I had the misfortune of hearing it at a party and I hope I never am so auditorally punished again. I HATE THIS RECORDING!"
4,Drop kicking basslines and screaming climaxes...,"describes this cd single, which is one of many, to the fullest. Liam Howlet (the musical genious behind The Prodigy) gives a taste of whats to come in the, then upcoming album; ""Fat Of The Land."" In this single you hear to be what I believe one of the phattest songs in the set, and if you too get your kicks out of hearing slamming bass and meaningless shouted slogans mixed and remixed then this is the single your looking for. Definitely the phattest out of all the singles from ""Fat Of The Land."" Do yourselves a favor and Go Get It!"
4,The prodigy shoot and score with this one.,"The single comes straight from the acclaimed album ""the fat of the land"" Most notable is the drum and bass remix. it's totally ganja krui reccomend, however, the album, as at only just over double the price (depending where you live), you get a lot more style for your money. NOT as good as Deisel Power! Shame, as after some months of listning, smack my bitch up has lost it's appeal whereas Deisel power keeps on stomping."
2,For kids only,"This movie is strictly for children, or for those adults who enjoy watching campy movies merely for their charm/cheesiness. I was entertained, but did not need to suspend my belief, because if I suspended it THAT far, I may have never have gotten it back. At worst it is a poorly acted, written, and developed movie that lacked consistancy in its story telling and historical context (not to mention poor 80's quality special effects, despite it's 1997 release date). At best, it is a fun and care free, get-away type film for the children."
4,Fiat Spider repair book,"The book was as described - a little shop worn, but the exact right copy and sent very quickly. I was pleased."
4,it's a great manual book for fiat 128,it's a great manual guide to re-build your own fiat 128 coupe ...
2,Quiet Alarm,"Don't buy this timer if you have a hearing problem. Unless you are in a quiet environment, you will not be able to hear the timer alarm. In itself, the timer's concept is great. The fundamental problem is that the alarm is faint. With the refrigerator motor, perhaps television on or perhaps the microwave running you cannot hear the timer ringing. In most cases, it does not take much ambient sound to drown out the ringing of the timer. It is certainly not suitable for the kitchen. I would not recommend this timer's purchase. I have this alarm in my office with two computers running. The alarm is barely perceptible."
2,"As others stated, quality control is poor","On the plus side, this timer is smaller than I thought it would be (a plus), and very cute.On the minus side, as others have stated, I'm not sure if the manufacturer is testing these! I ordered two of these, and while both worked as count-down timers, neither of them rang, vibrated, or buzzed, nothing. I had to return both of these.I think the factory needs to up their quality control."
5,excellent stop watch,so far it has worked great for me.I like its ability to alarm me with flashing light as I dont want any kind of disturbance to others.
5,Great little timer,"I bought this timer on the strength of other reviews I read on amazon. This product is everything it claims to be: easy to use and read, compact, and most importantly, affordable. The vibrating alarm works really well as a non-startling meditation timer for people like myself who can't afford the more traditional bell or singing bowl type."
2,Cheap,"Digital timers are great, but they rely on auditory stimuli to alert you. This timer uses auditory, visual and vibration to let you know time has expired. You can set it to use any combination of these modes. Usually timers like this are very costly and I was happy to see a less costly alternative. Well- you get what you pay for! I bought several of these and initially they were great. After a few uses not so much. Must be poor construction, because the audible timer decreased in volume quickly on all the timers. One fall to the floor and the light stopped working. The magnet broke off the back and the cllp broke. Timer feature still worked, but the entire thing was no different from any other digital timer.If you want something that is 100% reliable in all modes, this is unfortunately not the product for you."
4,good value,"The alarm does get more faint as the batteries wear down, so be sure to change the batteries every few weeks."
1,Cheap Timer,You get what you pay for here. There technical support staff was very helpful but the timer has mostly ceased to function after 3 months.
2,Longevity an issue,"Bought two of these in June 2008, one of them stopped working about a year later. Other than that, they perform well."
2,Kids vs Timer,The timer worked as advertised when I got it and I do not wish to imply it is faulty. Everything in my house though has to be able to survive 3 kids who like to help me cook. The timer still works but the done beep has broken and can only be heard if you are close and there is complete silence. (See prior 3 kids.) My house may be tough on timers but this one broke quicker than most. If you don't have kids this is probably great.
5,Nick says,This is an excellent timer for both zero up and top down timing. Well worth the price. Metall my needs and expectations
1,It doesn't work - Don't buy it,The timer will keep time but the alarm (audible or Vibrate) does not work at all...so it's useless to me. The reason I purchased this one is because it would sound an alarm.
4,"Greater timer, except for one design flaw","I bought this timer for my daughter to keep track of her piano practice. The timer works great and is simple enough that even an 8 yr old can use it. The different types of alarm can be quite handy, I suppose, depending on the user. We mainly leave it on audible alarm, pleasant beeps, not too loud. There is one design flaw, however... no ON/OFF switch, which means you can never shut off the device and prevent the 2 AAA batteries from being drained. The only way is to remove the back cover and then the batteries. Interestingly the timer will still work on one battery, depending which one you remove. I inquired the manufacturer about this (thinking maybe I missed something in the instructions), but received no response. Their website is completely useless, nothing more than a bunch of shopping links to purchase their products. If they had included a simple ON/OFF switch, this product would have received 5 stars from me; as is it's more like 3-1/2 stars."
1,"Great Features, Poor Quality","I purchased this timer about three weeks ago, and have used it regularly since then. The features behave as advertised, and I found it easy to use and perfectly suited for kitchen use. Unfortunately, it completely stopped working yesterday, and is now a $15 piece of trash. My advice: try to find a higher quality product. I'm going to."
2,"Great timer, if it works","Quality control is poor. I bought two, and one is a dud - no sound, no flashing and definitely no vibration (and yes, I've tried flipping the switches on the back). The other works well, apart from being too quiet and having no volume control."
5,POLDER TIMER W/VIBRATING ALARM,"Oh my goodness! I don't even know where to start! I work for the Post Office Rec Center and our work schedule is key 55 minutes break 5 minutes, key 55 minutes break 10 minutes, key 55 minutes break 5 minutes, etc, etc. I keep this timer on vibrate and it lets me know when my time for keying and breaks is up! I love it. I lost my first one and purchased another timer. Then I found my original one. Now I have two and couldn't be happier!"
2,I can't hear you...,"Polder Digital Timer with Vibrating, Audible, and Illuminated AlarmI bought two of these based on the great reviews.Unlike a lot of the one star reviews mine works fine. The problem I have is I can't hear the dang thing.If I am listening to music or the TV or vacuuming or doing anything that is louder than meditation I can't hear it. If I want it to be quiet, that's what the flashing light and vibrate are for. I want the ""audible"" to be, well, AUDIBLE!"
4,Good but sensitive,"Product works as advertised. The drawback is that it is really sensitive, so if you plan on wearing it or clipping it to anything, expect the alarm to be reset or stopped without your knowledge. This is an excellent timer if you leave it on a counter, but if you want to wear it or move it anywhere, it is useless. I tried to wear it at work as I walked around, and found that it was not effective. Also, wearing the alarm clipped directly against my side on the waistband of my pants as I exercised, I missed my stopping time because I could not feel the vibrating alarm at all. The three alert options are fantastic, but they are not all effective."
2,Timer,The volume on this timers ringer is very very low so unless you keep it next to you its almost impossible to hear.
3,Good features for a good price,"Neat features- lightup, vibrates, and/or rings. Wish it was smaller for use in special ed classrooms, but it's not that big. My only issue is that the clip on the back has broken off all of ours."
1,It didn't work!!!,"I was excited to try this out with my kids when it came, but NONE of the alarm features worked. Waste of time!"
5,Good purchase,"A very nice little timer with multiple options at a good price. Good for meditation, work outs, etc."
1,Piece fo Junk,"This timer looked good. however once I put batteries into it...the timer function worked ok, but when it counted down to zero....nothing happens. no audio alarm nor any vibration. tried new batteries, but nothing works.their web site is not helpful...just a bunch of links. seems like they are out of business and someone is selling their old junk to unsuspecting people.a waste of $$"
2,digital timer,"Like the many options: hours/min,min/sec,flashing light,viberate. However item received where left hand digit does not display completely.Clip on back placed to low on timer allowing timer to not hang upright."
2,Was defective..,"This would have been fine, but the one I received was defective and the digital display was all jarbled. I returned it and got a full refund so it's alright but annoying."
1,"Poor quality timer, lasted less than two months",This is a poor quality timer and it died on me after less than 2 months. I am a full time graduate student and I wanted a timer that I could turn off it's audible alarm while I studied and this Polder timer was just about the only one. I have been using it since I purchased it in early July 2008 and the vibrating function has died and it beeps even when the audible alarm has been turned off.I am currently trying to get Polder to replace it under the warranty.-Harry
1,Piece of Junk,This alarm is just a piece of junk. I never bought something so bad these couple years.Audible alarm do not workLight do not workVibrate do not workI ordered the replacement and it also didn't work. So I returned both of them. Very dissapointed.
1,Features did not work,"Seemed like exactly the product I needed for yoga and meditation. And it would have been if the features actually worked. But, the light alarm and audible alarm do not work. There are on/off switches for these features on the back of the timer, and whether set to on or off, they do not work. I tried replacing the batteries but that did not solve the problem. So, I paid too much for a basic timer. Disappointing. If it worked it likely would have been great."
1,I Hate This Timer,"I bought this timer because of the rave reviews and low price. I guess you can't expect a lot for under $10.00. Well, I got what I paid for!Not a lot. This timer is extremely small and light weight. I can completely cover it in my hand. Once you have set the timer, you have to be extremely careful how you handle or carry it. The start/stop button is the same button and if you accidentially just barely touch it, it will stop the timer and you might not even be aware you did it. You also have to change the setting on the back of it if you want to set it for one hour or more, or chage it if you want it set in minutes only. If you forget to make this change, you will mess up the time. This is very easy to do as it's hard to tell how it's set just looking at the front of it. Also, it doesn't show the time counting down so you can't tell how much time is left before it buzzes. I now realize that just because a product gets good reviews it can be completely wrong for me. Live and learn!"
2,Where's the quality control?,"I've bought three of these. One worked fine, on the other two the alarm functions did not work. Does anyone test these things in China?"
5,Great timer,"Functional, very easy to use. Counts up and down. 3 different ways to be alerted that time's up: it vibrates, it beeps, and it lights up. What more could you ask for."
5,Made this purchase based on the reviews,"and, I have to say, they were absolutely correct. I wasn't sure this was the timer I wanted but everyone's opinions were so positive. It is so easy to use and far more accurate than my old egg timer with bell. Since it is so lightweight, compact and portable, I find I use it far more frequently. One of my better purchases."
5,Digital Timer,"I bought this gadget to keep me on an ""eat every 3 hr schedule"" It is GREAT!..easy to use ...light weight...fits anywhere including pocket to time walking/exercise etc.."
5,Amazing,Collide makes amazing music.This DV is an artistic masterpiece you will actually want to watch more than once.A must-have for any complete music collection.
5,WOW!!!,"I think that this is one of the best thillers ever made. Jonathan Jackson is AMAZING! His character touched me, I wasn't angery with him. He was hurting, and I think that Jonathan Jackson showed the emotion better than anyone else could've done. It takes real talent to be able to pull that role off. The story line kept me on the edge of my seat and yet wasn't a freak movie that is too much. This is one to buy!!!"
2,Confusing,"As far as I'm concerned, this movie is not worth bothering to review. For me, the volume was so low on the dialogue often I could not understand what the actors were saying. The script seemed poorly written & the development of the characters was very superficial. There was no real final resolution at the end - but that may have been becuase the dialogue was so hard to uncerstand, the music often overshadowing it. The movie was very confusing, the credibility of the main characters never established.Highly not recommended for viewing."
4,Great Movie,"Skeletons In The Closet was a really cool movie! I recently added this DVD to my own collection, and I'm glad I did! It may not have been the greatest phsychological thriller in the world, but it was definately worth watching. I was very impressed with Jonathan Jackson's performace as Will Reid's (Treat Williams) 18-year old son with some deep, emotional problems. Williams was great as Jackson's paranoid father who undoubtedly has some issues of his own. Linda Hamilton was O.K. with the part she was given, even though her role could have been completely omitted from the script and not have changed the movie one bit. This movie is definately worth watching!"
1,What?,"Were these other people watching the same movie as us? This was one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long time. Amazon sells tons of great movies: this isn't one of them. I cared about the plot of the movie for approximately .13 seconds before I gave up. The acting reminded me of a ""PBS"" special, and the rest of the movie was so bad that we skipped a few chapters in the middle just to try to get to the end. I would have had more fun putting me hand in a blender for 82 minutes then watching that movie. I plan to send the producers a bill for my time, but I'll never be able to really recover it. The ending of this movie was more predictable then Titanic. Don't buy this..in fact, don't even rent it. Tell your friends not to either. Heartache."
2,Very Dissapointing!,"I have a very extensive collection of Dover classical score publications and this title is very deceiving. For readers that would like to explore the genious and creativity of Paganini, you will find little here in this book. Only the first movement is included in this score which leaves us little to read. I am very dissapointed in Dover. ""Full score"" leads me to believe that this would have been a FULL score."
1,Not Accurate,"Be very careful:This is not the Paganini Violin Concerto Op. 6It is an ARRANGEMENT.... of only the first movement.The main problem is Dover does not tell you this in the cover or in the product description... you have to buy it (like I did) and find out in the first page of the piece that it is not what it should be.It is an arrangement/orchestration from Paganini's piano score by August Wilhehmj. Interesting indeed, but not what is advertised... (and not the version that gets usually performed)"
5,Great little magna for penguin lovers,"Like the Seattle reviewer, I also only bought the book because I am a big penguin fan. The book starts off slows, and it is awkward as a westerner to read it right-to-left style, but it is worth it. The subtle comedy and the nifty drama makes it a can't-put-down book. Seeing a penguin try martial art moves, or the varios sprinkling of penguin trivia, just makes it the perfect magna for penguin lovers.A must have if you love penguins."
2,Floating Marriage Counselor,"A little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better. Ms. Cantrell spends the majority of the book being a relationship/marriage counselor, and though it's true issues become larger in smaller spaces, there are more issues for women cruisers than just their relationship dynamics. As I said, practical logistical information would have suited me better."
4,Interesting read if you are going to set sail one day.,"This is a great book for both men and women who are considering sailing. It gave me many things to think about as we start planning our next phase. It wasn't expensive and it's an easy read, so why not. More information is better when it comes to making a life changing decision like giving up everything (or not) to set sail.I enjoy that a woman wrote this book about other women making the same decisions. Most sailing books were written by men, about men, from a man's point of view. It was very refreshing and my husband enjoyed it as well!"
1,disappointing writing,This is written from the perspective of the woman that was dragged onto a boat!! So negative and not my experience with other women that I have met living the cruising life. Sorry cannot recommend it as a good read!!
2,Where are the spanish phrases?,"This DVD is a bust! It simply recites a list of nouns, pronouns, and verbs--it doesn't teach how to string these words into useful phrases and sentences for travelers."
3,I was tricked!,"I viewed the paper version but I found out that the Kindle version was cheaper, so I bought Kindle version. However, the Kindle version does not have the word list, which makes the book completely worthless."
4,Lots of Fun,We just received the Shark fin Slide and my 3 year old loves it. The slide is easy to climb. It has 9 holes on one side that sprays water onto the slide. My daughter likes that the water sprays side to side and not up. This slide is going to give her a lot of enjoyment this summer and hopefully more summers to come.
5,A must-read for anyone in the world of secure E-commerce,"The world of information security is full of complex inter-relationships between cooperating systems. A solid understanding of issues and possible solutions is a must for all levels of management. This book delivers on its promise of teaching security in E-commerce to readers of all levels. Though it is rich in content and full of excellent examples, it does not overwhelm the reader. Case studies are especially intriguing as they provide real-life examples of practical deployment scenarios. The humor in the book makes it very delightful to read. I highly recommend this book."
5,Blue's Clues Kindergarten,My 4 year old son really likes this learning activity and can navigate around in it pretty good by himself. He really likes the science section that tells about the different planets.
1,DO NOT buy if you have a large screen computer,"Unfortunately, since I own a large screen computer, my son was not able to play the games. The program does not adjust to screen size. The game would cut off important parts, which made it impossible to play the games.If you have a screen that's large, then you're bound to have a problem. I would suggest you buy Reader Rabbit computer games instead. Those work a lot better."
1,IMAC? Skip It.,"If you are using an Imac with OSX, do not buy this product. It requires some system gymnastics to work, which is beyond my four-year old's ability to perform every time she wants to play. Skip this one and go to something else."
1,MIS-REPRESENTED ITEM FROM AMAZON,"This part number from Microsoft and sold by Amazon is a 3-pack of OEM keyboards. Description of then item, including shipping weight and package size is of the 3-pack OEM packaging from Microsoft. What I received was a single keyboard NOT in the OEM package. Shipping description does not match was was shipped! Buyer beward as Amazon used to sell this as the intyented 3-pack, not a single keyboard."
1,Only 1 keyboard and mouse,I also only recieved 1 keyboard and mouse after reading that it sold as a 3-pack and reading other reviews from people who recieved 3 keyboards and 3 mice. I e-mailed Amazon about this but have recieved no response. Not worth the price.UPDATE:I e-mailed the seller directly and recieved a prompt response. They explained that it is a listing error and should not read quantity of 3. They have offered me a full refund if I return the product or a discount if I wish to keep the product. This is very fair.
3,ONLY ONE KEYBOARD AND MOUSE DONT BE FOOLED,"I received a great keyboard and mouse but only one set came in the mail!!I only bought this one thinking that there would be more than one keyboard and mouse! Still good but not worth the price I ended up paying, could've gotten a cheaper one to get the job done.oh well."
4,Before The Days Of The Big Red Dog,"As a big fan of puppies, kittens and baby bunnies, my daughter really enjoyed this book which tells of Clifford the dog's days as a puppy. The little girl in the tale has lots of fun playing with Clifford and sharing in his little adventures and misadventures.This is a great book for bedtime reading, and it is illustrated with many humorous pictures.Darien Summers, author of The Mischievous Hare, a children's book.The Mischievous Hare"
5,Cliffords Puppy Days,"Clifford's Puppy Days is about Clifford the Big Read Dog when he was younger. He was very small and always got lost in things. He would hide in hats, and people's purses. I like this book because it has a little bit of comedy in it and is rather funny. It also talks about how Emily, his owner, takes care of him and loves him. I also like this book because when I was little I always wanted a puppy and my mom would never get me one. So I read these books to see what it would be like to actually have a puppy."
5,Cresting feathers,"Great woodpecker book with pictures realistic in natural habitat, feathers fluffed up and sweaty. A perfect book for pen or sketching with pencil plus much additional info scientific etc. Don't hesitate to purchase."
4,DVD a bit jumpy but good value for wooden trains alone,"This is good value for the trains alone. They are the Thomas Wooden Railway trains. Duncan and Thomas (the trains in the picture) are the trains we received, although the box says ""Spencer""."
3,Connection requires line of sight,"I tried this at two locations - home and office. Both are for desktop PC use. So maybe I'm not using it as intended.At home, the performance is about 2 stars. My desk surface and my PC is separated by two cabinets (the PC being inside one of them). The distance is however less than 6 feet. Also, the receiver being plugged in at the front of the computer, it almost sticks outside of the cabinet, so it was *almost* line-of-sight. The connection was very sporadic. Mousing around was acceptable but not 100% smooth, scrolling was somewhat unresponsive, and mouse clicks were sometimes not detected at all.At the office, however, the PC sits on the desk next to my monitor, and it works perfectly. So, 5 stars there."
4,logitech mouse,Great mouse. Bought as gift for my daughter. It is easy to use and is so much easier than a touch pad. The color is a deep red and is nice and shiny. No problems with this product. I really like that the mouse shuts itself down if there has been no movement for awhile. Saves the batteries.
3,what happened w/logitech??,i've purchased more than 5 of this model.quality is getting worse.--dead & rusted battery included once--left click contact is badthis kind of basic troubles never happened with logitech.
4,Just love it...,"This was my first wireless mouse, extremely easy set up and I haven't had a disappointing moment yet!"
2,Ouch,I bought this mouse because I wanted to get rid of my tethered one. This was not ergonomic for me at all and months later am still having some pain in my arm. I've now got a new mouse that specifically stated that it was ergonomic and that has certainly helped.The other issue I had was that I used this outside when it was mid 80 degrees and the batteries 'popped'. They actually started leaking battery fluid and had to be thrown out. I've not had that happen with my new mouse and my husband's non tethered mouse also has never done that.
2,Cute but stopped working twice,"I am a great fan of Logitech and have been using their mice and webcams for years. Unfortunately, the V320 froze on my desktop twice (after one replacement). The excellent tech rep determined I had done everything right. Finally I asked him to let me have a proven ""workhorse"" mouse and he sent me a V200. That model works like dream! Logitech has one of the best customer services around."
4,Easy and Instant Use,I give this mouse 4 stars for the fact that it was a plug in and go operation. It loses a star because you have to download the software to use the one function that doesn't work on initial use. And function was the side scroll feature. I still have not downloaded the software and I don't think I will.
2,Good but small,"Pros: Excellent movement and control. Works great on multiple smooth surfaces. Responsive clicks. Fits both hands. USB receiver dongle is very small and unobtrusive, yet still transmits well. Light weight. Best of all, for me, the wheel clicks as you roll it.Cons: Too small for my tastes at roughly 4.5"" x 2.5"". It really only supports my fingers and part of my palm, which makes it uncomfortable to use for any length of time. The battery compartment is on top of mouse and slides around while I'm using the mouse. Feels cheaply made. Left-mouse button dead on arrival."
1,lasted 6 months,"I don't know the difference between the grey and black but my black version started to malfunction in about 6 months.The left button quit working. Customer Service by phone was unreachable, and by email was slow and had tokeep explaining problem. Finally was told a replacement would be sent. Two weeks later I'm told it's out of stockand I would have to wait. Therefore this company will take your money and not Honor their warranties."
5,Really Really Like This Mouse,"This mouse is especially made for laptops, which is why I purchased it. It's so smooth and works beautifully. It comes with a USB which is part of the mouse. You just put it back into the mouse and that's how it turns itself off. I have found that Logitech products are among my favorites, so after reading the good reviews on this product, I did not need any more convincing. It's small, but also just the right size. I would recommend it and would purchase again."
5,What is the logic behind breakthrough discoveries?,"From Archimedes' discovery of water displacement to Einstein, this poses connections between human invention and biological evolutionary processes. What is the logic behind breakthrough discoveries across scientific disciplines? Chapters examine how changes in thinking lead to revolutionary findings."
5,"Cheesy electronic\industrial,, YET still REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!!","My title says it all. Well not really. If you hate EBM, or dancy music of any kind, STAY away. But if you are a ture elcetronic\Industrial fanatic and like just about anything the 'industry' has to offer, then this CD should be added to your collection."
4,GOOD BOOK,GOOD BOOK BUT No INFO.I BOUGHT IT FOR A ENCYCLOPEDIA NOT A GUIDE OF AIRCRAFT COMPINEIS....
2,a bit too drying,"First of all, I'm not a dermatologist, I'm just a heterosexual guy with sensitive skin who has tried many products and done a lot of research in the search of the right products. I offer reviews of Clinique, zirh, menscience, art of shaving and baxter of California, hope my reviews are helpful.this face wash left my skin a bit too dry. you can get a similar face wash for way less at any drug store"
4,Good Book,I liked this book. Nia was a beautiful girl. She really tried to make something of herself. I also liked all the other characters except for one.I really disliked Suzanne. She was evil to the bone. I was really getting disgusted with her. I wish there was a follow-up book where she found real love. I do believe there are people out there that are really evil just like her. It is too bad though. Everyone deserves to find their true love. But you must have love in your heart in order to find that true love. This is a very steamy book. It is truly worth reading. Ms. Bussey accomplished creating very thorough characters.
4,The best romance book that I have ever read.,This book was very interesting. I like how the author mixed in all the characters together instead of them not having anything in common. I also like the surprise ending and hope to hear from the author that there is a continued part of it.
5,Marvman1,"A sizzling exciting story. One of the greatest I have read this year. The love scenes were unforgetable.Nia, Roland & Cal are memorable characters, who come off the page and into your life"
5,Knee Deep in Thunder,"Fantastic book. One I read many times as a child and young adult from our local library. I went back to read it again as an adult and it had ""disappeared"". I finally was able to purchase two copies through our local book store (before I had internet and Amazon access), one for me and one for my sister. It's one of those books you can read again and again. At any age."
5,"Wonderful, unforgettable and serious youth fantasy.","Like another reviewer, I read this book as a child (11). It was the first book I "" wanted"", and did read more than once. I believe the fact that I am 40, have not seen the book since grade school, yet clearly remember the title and authors name is a testament to the power of the characters and experiences they share. It is a moving story of unhappy girl, who retreats to a fantasy world. There she experiences great friendship, trials, tests of courage, endurance and grief. She evolves through this experience and finds strength to take back into her own ""real"" existence.Over the years, I have checked new and used book stores hoping to find it for my personal library. I am delighted to find it now."
5,So glad it's available again,"On a whim, I did a search for this book, thinking it would still be out of print. I have also mentioned this book to others over the years, and have never found anyone familiar with it. I too, read the book in about 7th grade, and have never forgotten the feelings it engendered. While the story details have become fuzzy, the impact is still powerful. I recall memorizing the poem on the inside cover page and reciting it to myself as I invented my own adventures in the woods and fields where I grew up. I can't wait to read it again!"
5,I have loved this book since I was a child,"I first read this book in 4th or 5th grade, and have read it many times since. My Mom finally found a hard cover copy after searching for years (pre internet). Later she found me the soft cover as well. It hooks you from the very beginning and you just can't put it down. A must read."
2,only toasts one side!,"This unit has a bagel feature that allows you to toast only one side. Unfortunately, whether the feature is on or off the toaster only toasts on side. I am returning it for something else. I like the stop toasting feature."
5,sunbeam 4slice wide slot toaster,this is one of the best toasters i have had and i just love it thanks very much .sherri carr
2,BURNT PLEASE!!!,"I dont write bad reviews on products but this one...boy I started using a toaster many many years ago. I thought to myself how hard could it be but after burning a loaf of bread, very hard. This toaster on the lowest setting will burn your bread, i tried bagels and ended up with croutons. To make matters worse the bread doesnt put up all the way. So have your money unless you like croutons for breakfast and dinner."
2,adjustment,"Have had a very difficult time adjusting. At lowest setting it was burning the toast. If we put it on highest setting it would burn the house down. It is finally set at 2 and seems ok, Think something is wrong with the heat adjustment. Wouldn't buy this brand again,"
1,Terrible product!,I received this as a Christmas gift and I haven't the heart to tell the gift giver what a piece of junk this toaster is. I don't have the receipt because it was a gift. I also threw the box away never dreaming that it would completely stop working on the left side after less than 2 months. Plus the right side only toasts on 1 side so I have to turn the bread around to toast the other side. I hate that hard earned money was wasted on this garbage. Buy another brand...this one is worthless!
5,Great gift for my daughter,"I bought this for my daughter...next time I need a new toaster, I will order the exact same one for me"
5,excellent deal wonderful toaster,Great seller would buy from him againXXXXXX ecellent toaster very pleased with it
1,not what I thought,"the toaster published looks much better than what I got. I received one in plastic material, it is untrustable for me. If I had known it was plastic, I wouldnt have bought it. The picture gives you a better impression. Also, mine isnt working well. It overheats in the lower level..I am dissapointed on this purchase."
1,Awful!,This toaster cannot be relied upon to do the basic function - toasting properly. The bread or bagel is either under-done or burnt. No amount of fiddling with settings fixes this. It's a TOASTER for crying out loud! Very disappointed - don't waste your money or time on this.
2,Half dead on arival,"This was suppose to be one of many father day gifts. The night before I plugged it in attempting to give it it's first burn off (dust etc...) I could only get one side to work, the other side just would not go down even after setting the temp, putting it on Bagel and putting the lever down many times, determined to get it to work, it wouldn't. We never used it that is why I gave it STARS, this had a cheap feel to it. This is going to be returned.NOW I FOUND A BETTER TOASTER in my search I found the ""Back to Basic 4 slice"" and will cook 2 eggs with ham even sausage rounds and cheese etc... all by the time your toast is done, why mess around when you want to eat quick without the mess, I'm spending the extra money. I also read how great the customer service is by many.Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster"
1,uggh.........Updated,"Update November 2011: Amazon sent me another and it works just fine. no problems with it, just an issue with that particular unit apparently.I purchased this toaster to replace my old GE toaster that I purchased from Walmart for about 15 bucks 5 years ago (it finally just died). I got this toaster after the delivery service apparently didn't route it correctly and the delivery date was pushed back (I have prime, should have been here in 2 days), however that has nothing to do with this rating. The only setting this one has seems to be burnt, it does not matter if I choose 1 or 7 it burns everything. Also, I can't use both sides at the same time, I think it must have a fuse in it that keeps tripping every time I try to use both sides. I am sending it back to Amazon and having them send me another one, I am hoping that this was just a bad toaster and that it has nothing to do with the design, if the second one is fine I will come back and update the review."
4,It's a toster,"It does what it's supposed to do and matches our kitchen decor.good newsis that is does not get the toast or bagel stuck anymore, and I can make toast for two unstead of one at a time like our old one. This is something we have needed an upgraded for quite some time now. So far no major issues."
3,Rob D.,"After getting this toaster the other day I see what some of the other reveiwers were saying. The toaster seems to be built cheaply. It went right back into the box and will be returned. I'm gonna go with the toaster/egg cooker, its about 30 more but seems cool and worth it!"
2,toaster,"The inside wires do not heat up as much as the outside ones do, so I had to pop the toast out, turn it around and pop the toast back down. Gave it away."
2,Not worthy of the name,"Received the product just fine. Opened the box and it was pretty to look at and that's where the wonder-of-it-all ended. Unit claims to have a cable storage area under it which unfortunately as a result of the short cable it was unusable. Also cable leaves the unit from the right side and was extremely short, leaving little placement agility. So after acquiring a power strip to make up for the placement issue I was further disappointed by its operation . . . all inside heating elements would not heat up at the same rate as the outside elements and when the toast popped out it was only toasted on one side. Tried the unit a few more times to see it maybe it just needed some use to get with the ball game but to no avail. Sent the product back for a refund not worth the trouble to replace."
3,Fair value,This is an okay toaster for the money. It does not do a great job as it does not toast very evenly. But it is not too bad.
3,DOES NOT TOAST EVENLY,"THE TOASTER DOES NOT TOAST EVENLY ON BOTH SIDES. I READ THE DIRECTIONS AND THOUGHT IF I KEPT THE BAGEL BUTTON OFF THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN, BUT IT STILL HAPPENS. ONE SIDE OF THE TOAST IS TOO LIGHT AND THE OTHER IS WAY TOO DARK. THE SIDES OF TOAST ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO TOASTING THE SAME.I STILL GIVE THE TOASTER 3 STARS BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP, AND IT LOOKS GOOD.THE BLACK TOASTER LOOKS A LOT BETTER THAN THE WHITE ONE I USED TO HAVE.I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER WHITE TOASTER, THEY LOOK HORRIBLE."
1,I am lucky to still have a place to live.,"I just bought this toaster the other day and was thrilled to the bone over how unacceptable it was. The elements only worked on one side of the toasting slots -and- I've already had to throw it away due to the small electric fire it conveniently started inside the housing itself tonight, filling my entire apartment full of burned electronics smell. I'm lucky because I caught it time. Yay for quality made products. To further slap me in the face, I cant even return it."
2,Spend more,"It doesn't toast evenly, sometimes two of the slots don't heat up at all, it melted, the actual plastic where you place the toast into the toaster melted... and it's ugly. The ugly part was clearly visible oinline but I thought I could live with it for 24 dollars... now I have to spend again since a restocking fee of 15-50% will be charged if I return it..."
1,Friends don't let friends buy this toaster,"I am throwing this toaster out today, after having owned it for slightly longer than one month. It seemed to be fine for about the first week. After that, the timer started working intermittently, so that every once in a while, but with increasing frequency, what ever was in the thing would simply burn to a crisp. More recently, it started toasting unevenly, so that half the bread or bagel would be quite dark and the other half would look like it had never been in a toaster. I went out and bought a 4 slice Cuisinart toaster, which is what I should have done to begin with. It is considerably more money, but at least it works."
1,Terrible - Do not purchase,This is a terrible product. The toaster does not toast evenly or consistently. The mechanism on the right side broke on our unit. There is no release when you want to pop the toast up to examine if it is done. It would have been less trouble to just burn my money.
2,Toaster,"This toaster is okay. It does not brown evenly 1/2 dark the other 1/2 perfect brown, but we are not perfectionist. It does have a few perks that I do like. You can set it for bagel or toast. It browns hamburger rolls nicely. I like the ""stop"" button and that you can also lift up the toast higher so getting it out is much easier. If you are looking for a 4 slice toaster that is inexpensive and aren't fussy about even toasting, then you will like this. The perks to me out way uneven toasting."
2,toaster review,"This toaster is made cheaply of lightweight plastic. We've only had it about a month and already one side of the four slice option is not working properly. If you put two slices of bread in one side, one of them burns. I don't think this toaster will make it a year. For the money I wish I would have bought another brand although I'm not sure what brand since they all seem to be made shoddily nowadays."
2,Sunbeam 3911 4 slice toaster,"I expected something a little more substantial. It is lightweight and tinny, does not toast a whole bagel, the top sticks out of the machine. Dissappointed."
4,it is a toaster,the toaster is not very consistent especially on the left side to right side ratio. but with a few burnt slices you can figure it out.
2,not good for bagels or buns,This is a nice looking toaster and toasted bread very evenly and quickly. The downside is when toasted bagels. Every toaster I have had that had a bagel feature toasted only the sliced side which I thought every at home bagel eater would want. When I put my hamburger buns in it toasted both sides actually burning the outside of the bun. Like most people I wanted the sliced side toasted but wanted the outside untoasted. If you only want this toaster for regular toast then it works well for that especially for its low price.
1,PLASTIC TOASTER???,I discovered when I received the toaster that the photo on the box looked as though the toaster was made of plastic. Imagine my surprise to discover that it IS made of plastic and that consumers had complained about parts of the plastic melting. One reviewer included a photo of the toaster with most of one side melted away. Complaints about uneven toasting were also common. It goes without saying that I will not be making a gift of the fire hazard as I had planned. I will be returning it.
5,An amazing account of JSD,"As a current Citadel cadet I was amazed at how accurately knob year was portrayed and although I never experienced Junior Sword Drill, I can imagine it was done just as accurately. This was an amazing account of the struggles, hardships, and training that these men went through. Hopefully the Guards will never die like JSD did, but the way things are changing it's easier to disband them than to defend them. Let's just hope that the administration never takes the easy route, for the Citadel has never been about taking the easy way out!"
3,chain turns black in 2 days of use,"this stuff puts out an awful lot of black grime on my chain that i can't get rid of to this day. as far as performance goes, it's great just turns black really quick."
4,Does the job,"We've been looking for a black, four slice toaster for under $35.00 and this one fit the bill perfectly. Actually, it outperforms my last Krupp,Braun and TFal toasters for a lot less money. The unit heats up immediatley, toasts very evenly, has great dual controls (in case you're only toasting 2 slices) which include an eject button if you're getting impatient. Also has dual removeable crumb trays which just slide right out...cleanup could not be easier. It's just a little bulkier than we're use to and it seems to take a LONG time to get dark toast but aside from those minor flaws I'd absolutly recommend this toaster to anyone."
5,Sunbeam Black 4 Slice Toaster,"Makes great bagels, but is a tricky machine. The toast and bagel settings are completely different. I still can't get toast to the right degree of doneness. The right and left pairs of slots don't toast the same, making it even harder to learn this toaster. Also, it is really dumb of Sunbeam to only make this in one color, black. This toaster is OK if you are patient and have a sense of humor."
5,Great toaster for a really good price,"Not too much to say about this product except that it far exceeded my expectations. For the money you get a well made, very modern looking and a great toasting toaster! Controls are easy to use, cleaning trays are right in the front, the wide slots accommodate any item you would want to toast, and one nice thing it does that isn't really a feature is the extra quiet ejection at the end of the toasting cycle.All-in-all a great toaster!"
1,PRESENTS FOR YOU IS BAD !!!!!!!!!!!,I ORDERED ON 12/10 THEY CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD ON 12/12I CALLED ON 12/14 TO INQUIRE ABOUT SHIPPING (THEY SAY 1-3 BUSINESS DAYS)WAS TOLD IT WOULD SHIP ON 12/15 AND I WOULD RECEIVE SHIPPING CONFIRMATIONON 12/20 I CONTACTED MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY TO REQUEST REFUND AND ALSO E-MAILED PRESENTS FOR YOU AND THEN THEY REFUNDED MY MONEY WHICH SHOWS ME THAT THE ITEM STILL HAD NOT SHIPPED 10 DAYS AFTER ORDERED WAS PALCEDDO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Good Monitor For a Good Price,"I replaced a Hyundai L90D+ with this monitor. After staring at a 4:3 monitor for a couple of years, it's going to take some time to get used to the additional real estate provide by this LCD. Beyond that, it came with cables (DVI *and* analog), and most important of all, a height-adjustable stand which is the primary reason I selected this monitor over all of the other 22-inchers.Out of the box, no stuck or dead pixels at all.The backlight is pretty noticeable when displaying dark content, and it seems more pronounced at the bottom that at the top of the screen.However, for the money, you can't get a better 22-inch LDC. My advice - get one."
2,Major problems with trying to watch any type of movie-video,"Viewing the internet this monitor was great. When I tried to play a movie, DVD DISC, MPEG, AVI, ANYTHING. The picture was terrible. Very bad pixilation. I was told it might be the video card. I bought a new card XFX geforce 7600 gs, for another $150.00. Same quality on films. I tried latest driver from XFX, from nvidia, etc. Changed screen resolutions, everything you could think of, I tried. The picture for viewing movies was terrible. I hooked my old 15 inch monitor back up, the picture quality for movies is great. I have returned this monitor, now I have to wait for a refund before I will try a different monitor. The black light bleed is very bad. If you watch films on your monitor, you can't help but notice it.PS. Amazon was great about refunding shipping. Amazon is the best online store there is."
3,Samsung SyncMaster 225BW a Big Disappoitment!,"This is a beautiful monitor with clear picture. The problem is stupidity at Samsung. Many Samsung widescreen monitors rotate 90 degrees, so you can view a long document. This monitor even comes with the software to do this (MagicRotation) but the stand is not built to allow the monitor to rotate. It will raise in height, tilt front to back, and swivel side to side. No rotation! What a disappointment! I guess I could spend some time trying to build a custom bracket to allow the monitor to attach to the stand and swivel - or maybe they sell one? Samsung customer care didn't know.P.S. You will need to upgrade your video card to be able to use this. It must support 1680X1050 resolution. I ordered the Diamond Radeon 9550 256 Mb and it works fine."
1,"Died After 46 Months, Okay Picture","One of the problems when reviewing computers and related peripherals is timing. By the time users experience the long term durability of a product, it is out of production. Hopefully, potential users can glean information on brand quality and the quality of lower-end products by specific brands if long-term reviews are available. In the case of the Samsung 225BW, the monitor failed 46 months after it was purchased -- less than four years. From the dim flicker and rapid extinguishment of the picture, it appears that the lamp has failed. In general, I have not been happy with low end monitors by Samsung or Dell. My suggestion is to avoid such products because there is no way to evaluate what will fail prematurely."
5,very sharp,"Really amazed at this monitor... Went at Fry's & Best Buy, then check them all and it was the best. I have a set of test photos, and the sharpness of my kid little face was one or two steps up any other monitor I could try - even the most recent ones. 225UW is same. Contrast does not look exceptional on the paper, but honestly I could not see the difference with others of higher spec (using colorful flowers on a dark background)only cons:- yes, some backlight bleeding if you look movies at night; does not bother me, you need to look for it (I wonder if a sticking some paper band would work ??)- not possible to rotate the screen vertically"
2,Backlighting was the killer for this monitor,"The picture quality seemed nice at first and I was initially pleased ... but the backlighting that others have mentioned was horrible. Even if you run applications that never have black displayed at the top or bottom inch or simply want a larger inexpensive monitor, this really will not suffice. I returned this monitor and purchased the 24"" Dell, and I noticed a huge difference in build/picture quality immediately. This Samsung monitor is light weight and did not reassure me that I made a quality purchase. Hate to say it ... but you get what you pay for. I really cannot recommend this Samsung monitor to anyone."
2,lasted 60 days beyond 3-year warranty,My 225BW won't light up. It made it past the warranty by 60 days but I am looking for a new monitor. It was good while it lasted but one expects more use out of a $300 purchase.
3,"This was the 4th. Samsung monitor I bought for my business, have not been as happy.",I was expecting to receive a piano black with the same or better sharpness and clarity as the other three. Needless to say I was disappointed and shortly after I gave it to my financial adviser whose company was still using the big antiquated bulkt screens. He was tickled to have that especially at no cost to him.I purchased a Samsung 245 BW with piano black. Looks great and great resolution.
3,what should an impolsive buyer expect,I expected more than what I got but this what I get for such little research it is a loud system except for the fact that only 2 of the 6 speakers work while playing the radio
1,This system stinks,I bought this system as a Christmas gift for my husband. I am embarrassed to even say I spent one cent on this so called DVD Home Theatre System. Can you return it? I do not even see where you can return this item. We will be watching the a DVD and the volume will just go mute. It is very aggravating. If you turn the volume up past one you get blasted! I would not recommend this system.
1,"ok sound, but little else...","The sound on this system is generally ok. Unfortunately as many people have written; this system is unnervingly loud! Not to mention that the back of the speakers do not have any sort of holes in them for mounting brackets (even though they include them!) so are we supposed to risk screwing our own holes and breaking the speaker to mount them properly? This is basically what I was told from KLH's support.The bottom line: if you like VERY loud speakers at the lowest volume, questionable support service and shoddy quality control and craftsmanship, these speakers are for you!"
1,Not worth the trouble,"I wish I had checked the reviews before ordering. I assumed that there would be a line-in to run my cable and VCR sound through the system. It appears to me that these systems keep getting recycle. The one I received had at least three layers of tape on the flaps from being returned, all the internal packaging was opened and the cables were all loose on the top of the box. I didn't get far enough to check out the speakers, I stopped when I confirmed my suspicion that no line-in was provided. Spend another $20-50 to get something better."
3,didn't bother hooking it up,"I bought this unit because of its high rating and it seemed economical. The problem is there is not a single input, if you want the sound from your TV or VCR to play through this unit, forget it. I guess its my fault for assuming this product would have such an obvious feature for a home theater. I gave the unit 3 stars because I did not actually try it, once I saw there were no inputs, it was on its way back. ..."
4,The Password is...,"The password for the parental control is 3308, not 2001. I got a hold of tech support finally, so anyone that is stuck can give that a try."
4,what is the password?,"Three things:1) There are no sound inputs, as other reviewers have pointed out. Personally, I don't mind, as I have my VCR running through my home stereo system already. It would be nice if I could play my CD, tape, and record players through it, though.2) The default sound level is quite loud, but this can easily be adjusted on the ""Preferences > Dynamics"" menu. You can only get to this menu if there is not a DVD in the player, though, which is just stupid.3) The unit I ordered came with the parental control settings ON, and the default password given in the manual (""2001"") is incorrect. I hope that the tech support phone number will be able to help on Monday, otherwise I will have to send this back."
3,"Details, details!",Bought the system and had little trouble with the setup. I agree that it is loud. The system doesn't seem to adjust volume at all via the set up menu despite what the manual claims. It is also very frustrating to go play a PG movie only to find the parental locks are on and guess what- the manual has the wrong password. I would really like to see the correct default password posted. Overall I will say the system is a vast improvement over what I had before.
1,Lowest Volume Setting Still Too Loud,"Although the DVD player & speakers are nice, the sound is still REALLY loud when the volume is turned down to ""1"". The volume is completely off at ""0"" and is loud at ""1"", very loud at ""2"", and continues up until it is ridiculously loud. I tried fiddling with all of the settings, but I could not reduce the volume to a moderate or soft level. Since I live in an apartment, I wanted to watch DVDs at a moderate volume with theater-quality sound. I could only get the sound moderate-to-soft by turning off most of the speakers, which defeats the purpose of a home-theater system."
4,KLH DVZ-2500 DVD Player Default Password,"The default password mentioned in the instruction book which comes with this product gives the INCORRECT code of 2001. The CORRECT, permanent, hard-coded, will-always-work password is 3308. The problem is that the default for the parental lock is ON. And there are many movies you cannot watch without unlocking the parental lock. Then, when you look up how to turn it off in the instructions, the wrong code is given. After calling tech support I learned that this was a mistake in the instructions and that the correct default code is 3308."
5,You can NOT beat this value!,"While I do agree with volume 1 being a little loud for an apartment, everything else about this system rocks.After spending another $... to upgrade the speaker wire and RCA analog signal wires, this system is clean. The signals are discrete and in a smaller room, really sounds big. There is center and rear surround delays which also help as the processor isn't the best.The system came with mounting hooks to hang the speakers. The powered sub has an auto-off feature which is great as I have it hidden in a closet. This little 50 watt sub is using the whole closet as it's enclosure now :) and last night watching the Patriot, the bed was shaking from cannon blasts on volume 3!!Bottom line, the system is worth twice as much as it sells for."
2,Too many problems!,"I purchased this unit for friends as a Chistmas present based on Amazon's positive description. They have been trying to set it up for 3 weeks and have run into all of the problems mentioned in the customer reviews. Hopefully, it will work eventually. Shame on Amazon for not having alerted prospective purchasers."
1,OK DVD player if/when it works,1) Volume problem when playing CD (too loud)2) DVD played OK3) Setup was easy (color-coded) and manual was OK4) Got a replacement - same CD problem and DVD is broken as well - sending the whole thing back.5) Would have been a nice system if it worked.
1,"No instructions, no manual and no help","This system might be ok. I would need an instruction manual first. The system came without the manual and nobody seems to be able to find one. Apparently this is a new system so there are no manual available for it? One problem that we may or may not be able to fix is the input level for the DVD player. The volume level can not be adjusted on this system it is alway playing TOO LOUD. So loud actually, that we can't even use the system because it is TOO LOUD. We might eventually be able to adjust the input volume level but we will need an instruction manual to do it. Since there are no instruction manuals available we won't be able to turn it down, or live with a system that performs this way. I am sure I will eventually have to return this item."
3,Important Topic but Strong Bias & Mistakes,"The relationship of American Jews to Israel is a very important one that has been sorely neglected by researchers and so it was nice seeing a study of the Diaspora Jew-Israeli Relationship but the book was less of a study and more anecdotal. Rosenthal's obvious leftist, anti-Orthodox bias showed greatly and he made many mistakes, particularly when talking about Israeli culture and society. He misspelled several Israeli & American Jewish leaders names and showed a complete ignorance of Judaism as a religion (from all stripes, incl. Reform & Conservative/Masorti).Unless you can find a better book w/ this study, buy this book. but Rosenthal needs to learn more about Israel and Judaism before he can make an informed study."
4,DDT goes digital,"DDT is probably, no not probably, IS the best Russian Rock band ever, and this dark, electronically and digitally infused album is just another stamp on the trail of their overall exellence. However, 4 stars come from some gaps in the flow of this album with some overly digital and overly weird exurbs, and times where head-banging hard rock riffs drown out this band's time aquired style of meaningful lyrics. Metel - Beautiful, from start to finish... I will never get tired of this song. Rasstreliali Rassvetami - another amazing display of Shevchuk's poetic talent. Geroy - bittersweet and very hard-hitting. The rest of the songs are more or less an aquired taste. I've aquired it, and any DDT fan surely will as well. For those of you who have not heard DDT music before, Come on..."
2,Quality Control Issues?,"I've had the Juiceman for about 1 month now. At first I was happy with its power to blend almost anything I threw at it. However, over time the jar began to leak around the blade area. The Juiceman makes great smoothies... when it works. Unfortunately, after my own experience as well as that of other reviewers, it seems this product is not built that well."
2,Motor burned up after 3 months,"I liked it for grinding up wheat grass in green Odwalla until the motor started spewing out black metallic powder and quit after about 3 months. Plan on using your warranty if any, if you go with this. The 600 watt Cuisanart best buy looks like the one I want to try next. That should be enough power and run longer than this one did."
2,motor burns out,"I am now on my 3rd smoothie maker. They work great for a while and then the motor burns out. My first one lasted 11 months, the second one lasted 15 seconds! We'll see how long the 3rd one lasts. I use this mostly for smoothies during the hot summer and have lost about 6 weeks this summer while waiting for replacements in the mail! It's a good product otherwise, but I'd recommend buying something more reliable."
1,It is good when it works,"We purchased this blender in Feb. 2003. It broke shortly there after. 6 weeks later a replacement came in the mail. 3 weeks later it stopped working. While it works, it is indeed impressive."
1,Don't Give This Machine a Heavy Load,"I bought this blender to blend soups; spinach, for example. It is underpowered at startup, and it takes only a half dozen or so operations to burn up the motor."
2,Not durable at all,"I was quite disappointed with this blender. It worked fine for about 2 months, but then the motor blew out as I was blending a smoothie. I wasn't even using any ice at the time. For a blender this expensive, it should last longer than 2 months.I'm planning on replacing it with a Waring."
5,Look no more for your dream blender,"I looked and looked, they all seemed so plastic and awkward. And I am no big fan of lots of buttons. Then I saw the Juiceman. 900 volts, big container -- everything about it said INDUSTRIAL GRADE! A man's smoothie maker -- YES! I think the design is great and does it ever whip up shakes! Two bananas, a bowl of strawberries, ice cream, ice cubes -- any order you please, it all gets done fast, it's not too loud, it all locks together very well, and it cleans up fast. What else could you want?"
1,Works great for 2 weeks ???,"This is a copy of the email I sent to SALTON about their Juiceman blender.I thought you would like to a copy of the recommendation I have been posting on webs site that sell the Juiceman Blender which seems to co-inside with other recommendations on the sites:The first blender worked great for two weeks, then the motor blew. I contacted customer support and they made me ship it back them before they would replace it. Three weeks later I received a new one, and AGAIN after 3-4 weeks of use the motor on this one has blown too. Tomorrow I will contact Customer support AGAIN....... At the price I paid for it and the obvious manufacturing defect (judged from other reviews) I think they should ship out a new one overnight. But we all know that will not happen... maybe I could charge them rent as they have for 50% of the time.All I did was to try to make Margaritas. My little 9 year blender lasted longer doing the same thing. What gives?????"
2,"Low quality, non-sealed bearing fails again","This blender gave me 14 months of good service before the bearing in the jar assembly failed. This seems to be the experience of many others based on these reviews. When I called Salton, they quoted me$35 for a new jar assembly plus $10 shipping. Not worth it since they apparently haven't rectified the problem. Have purchased the Kitchenaid KSB560, with the hope that it will be as durable as the last Kitchenaid blender I had (which I gave away in excellent condition after 9 years to purchase the more powerful Juiceman)."
1,bad copy,"i have bought two copies of this game. they were bad reprints of the original. on level 8 it cuts off. i had the original about 12 years ago and the CD and case was different. i have disc 2 of the original and tried both disc. I hear others out there with the problem.IF THE DISC SAYS ""INFOGAMES"" IT NOT THE ORIGINAL AND ITS NO GOOD.MOST THE GOOD STUFF START AFTER LEVEL 8 AND 9."
1,Not impressed,"The thumbsaver feels awkward, and leaves a hickey type mark on the the thumb. I dont like the fact you cant feel the muscles"
5,Worth the money,"While this product is pricey, the quality, the design, and the functionality makes it true bargain. This is not bling for the kitchen, but rather a seriously built, functional shelf. We have 12 All Clads hanging from it, with the book shelf completely full. It is meant to be attached to wall studs, if you do not install correctly, it will be a disaster waiting to happen."
2,Not what I expected,"Shipping was expedient. However, these spats were not what I expected. They were cheaply made. Buttons where in white and not black like picture showed. They velcro'd closed and were made of a felt like material. These would work, they just look cheap. I was hoping they were vinyl because of the price."
4,Works for a Costume,"I wanted costume spats and I got costume spats. They fit fine, they got the message across, they didn't fall apart, and they didn't cost too much. Works for me. I don't know how well they would fare if used heavily, but I'm not entirely sure who would use them heavily. They did need adjustment pretty consistently throughout the night though. I keep them around in case there is a period themed swing dance party on campus, but unless I modify them I doubt they would stay on through that. Basically, they work fine unless you need them to stay looking sharp through heavy motion. A side note, almost no one who saw them recognized them as spats or had any idea what spats were. Kids these days."
3,"Not bad, but....","This book dissects meticulously various reasons & aspects of the bosnian deluge. All in all, it's an indispensable reading. BUT, it oversimplifies one aspect of war: Croat-Muslim conflict. An uninformed reader may get the impression that Croats tried to cleanse Muslims from Central Bosnia and Herzegovina. Numbers speak the opposite:1. Intercommunal fighting ethnically ""cleansed"" 150,000 Croats from Muslim-held areas & 50,000 Muslims from Croat-held areas.2. Civilian victims of coldly calculated massacres: circa 200 Muslims and 960 Croats.3. In Central Bosnia, Croatian forces ( HVO) fought ( successfully ) an uphill battle-they were outnumbered 12/1 by Muslim soldiers.*This* story was presented one-sidedly & schematically via accepted stereotypes ( poor Muslims, who as if by magic earned the name Bosnians, are purely & undisputably the sole victims ). Yet, they were as yet unrecognized aggressors & butchers as well."
3,"On balance, balanced, but...","This book dissects meticulously various reasons & aspects of the bosnian deluge. All in all, it's an indispensable reading.

Yet, they were as yet unrecognized aggressors & butchers as well."
2,Not what I needed,"The blades are ridged, which is what i didn't want. There was no description so I assumed the blades were smooth."
3,Bonus car may not be Bulgy,"I ordered this DVD because (1) my son loves Percy, and (2) he really wanted a Bulgy the Bus, which is pictured as the bonus vehicle that comes with the DVD. Our DVD arrived with Skarloey instead of Bulgy. If you're looking for Bulgy (he's hard to find), be wary that this might happen to you, too. The DVD otherwise is great."
5,This CD Rocks.,"This CD is for anyone that likes Metallica. ""Hero of the Day"" Is in my opinion one of the best songs I have ever heard. The guitar riffs are incredible and the lyrics speak for themselves. This is the awesome single any hard rock fan would fall in love with the first time they pop it in their player. On a scale of 1-10 this single is a 20."
2,"Too expensive, too little, look elsewhere","This expensive ($23) Japanese import is a big disappointment. First, there are only 7 tracks, less than 30 minutes of music. Second, the CD is labled ""Live"", but only three of the seven tracks are actually live. The music is good, but the CD feels like it's unfinished, like part of it wasn't included, like it's actually a bootleg album. From the title, I thought it was a concert recording, but it's just a random collection of live or radio or studio off-cuts. The music is good, but for 23 bucks I feel cheated. I recommend you spend your money on other Corrs albums first. Their music is very worthwhile, but this CD is not."
5,"""Rainy Day"" is worth the money alone!","All the songs on this suspiciously expensive mini-album are great, but ""Rainy Day"" rocks! Along with ""So Young"", ""Toss The Feathers"" and ""Dreams"" this is the Corrs at their upbeat, Celtic flavoured best. Also the dance mix of ""Right Time"", whilst not being a radical departure, is quite good."
1,Unfortunately Not Enough Content for Your Money,"The music on this cd is good. ""Rainy Day"" is a fun musical rarity and the other songs are all very well performed but with only 7 songs on the cd I think it's a complete rip off--the songs are good, but not THAT good. For $$ you'd expect to get at least a full concert of live songs but this feels like an extended cd single. I mean I know imports cost more but this simply doesn't have enough music on it to be considered a full length cd. Furthermore, it's called ""The Corrs Live"" yet some of the songs aren't even live.This purely seems like a mercenary venture. Andrea and Caroline Corr were listed as two of the richest women 30 years old and under in Ireland--now I know why. Save your money."
4,"Nice, but there could have been more tracks included.","Okay, first of all The Corrs are great as a live band and this cd proves that, too. I like the song ""Rainy Day"", originally a B-side for one of their singles. Then, the remix of ""The Right Time"" disappointed me a bit...but it's certainly not the worst Corrs remix ever made. The others, the live ones, are good, especially ""Secret Life"" and the acoustic version of ""Forgiven, Not Forgotten"". A must-have for Corrs fans."
2,Unhappy,I felt this tape was very poorly done. She jumps into exercises too quickly without warning.
1,DVD was defective,"I'm sure this would have been a good work out DVD however it was defective (perhaps that is why it was only 8.97?) The strange thing was it was packaged as new. I ended up throwing it out, skipped all the way through, even though I cleaned the DVD thoroughly. When I looked at the DVD there was streak all the way through it. Looks like this seller received a bunch of defective DVD's and sold them as ""new"""
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,What a waste of time and energy. Yet another hastily put together piece of junk by Jillian Michael. These videos are starting look as if she does no prep work at all. I watched the video once and immediately was not impressed with her attempt bring yet another Big loser boot camp style degrading workout to the mainstream population. I am glad that I did not pay full price for this scrap. Talk about a fame whore!!!!!!!! Geez!!!!!!!!!! This chick will slap her name on dog crap if it came with a dollar and a video camera. FROM THIS RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
4,I haven't used it yet!,"Unfortunately, when I purchased the video, I was not aware that I needed to have a step. I don't so I haven't used it yet. However, I saw the video and I am certain I will love it.!"
5,You will work hard!,"I love this box set! How can you go wrong using a step to increase intensity?! First of all I bought this set back when people were not feeling Jillian Michaels like they are now so I knew then she was tough. You will get results, but you have to work hard and stop crying about her using a step. I also like her personality in this dvd because she is having fun and not being so rude like she is in her newest videos. If you want your heart in your throat get this set and use the step. You will feel this one!"
5,Great workout!,"The first time I did these videos, I had to take a few breaks. But don't give up on these. I have only been doing them a short while and can already see a HUGE difference. Like another poster, this is the only video I've done that has brought down the fat percentage. And the more you do them, the 'easier' they got. Granted, they will never be EASY and that's the point. These will get you moving and losing!"
3,Kickbox in the slow lane,"I am sorry that I can't be more supportive of this video, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. I thought it would be more aerobic with constant moving and some choreographed routines, but you do a move for a few repititions and then you pause before transitioning to another one. This feels more like a boot camp than an aerobic-style class. I found this one to be a bit boring, as compared to some other kickbox videos that I own. (e.g. Kathy Smith - Kickboxing Workout).This video is probably good for a beginner that wants a little variety in their workout, but it is too slow for an intermediate level workout. It would be helpful if the industry would ""rate"" their videos with an intensity level.Last word ... this video forces you to listen to Jillian's life story before the workout begins. Please don't make me watch this every time I want to use a video. Make this an option to view at my leisure."
5,The Biggest Winner DVD set,"Just a bit intimidating at first. But, I did as much as I could and I build up a little day by day. Jillian is very encouraging."
4,Great Quick Workout,"I think this series of DVDs are great for a quick, intense workout. I feel as if I get the cardio and strength benefits of a long workout condensed into about 25 minutes of a cross fit routine. I personally do not subscribe to Jillian's ""Bully"" mentality towards working out so I find her annoying but you can't deny the benefits of the DVDs."
2,DVD quality BAD,"I love Jillian, but I think the distribution company was in such a hurry to release this DVD that they didn't QC them well. I'm sure the work out is great, but I haven't had the chance to do it becuase as soon as the beginning warm up is over the DVD pauses and it brings me back to the main menu. It would be fine if the work out was separated in the main menu by chapters but it is not. If I fast forward past the problem spot that seems to work but who would want to do that each time?"
2,Way too short,"With the hype about her TV show, I thought I'll give this one a try. I like kickboxing, but I should have known better, because I didn't like her weight workouts either when I tried them some time ago. It appears she gears toward overweight individuals that are out of shape, but there are many advanced exercisers out there that want good, fun, challenging and LONGER workouts because after a while exercise becomes addictive and no pep talk is needed. This one does get your heart rate up somewhat, but it's over before I feel that I got a real workout. I think it's only about 20 minutes at the most. The rest on this DVD are testimonials, recipes, advice, etc. I just don't think it's worth the time and money when there are so much better choices out there."
2,Very Basic Kickboxing,"I'm not saying this is a bad DVD. However, it is VERY basic cardio kickboxing and its very short in duration. I understand now why it was cheap. I wouldn't purchase this again as a single DVD. I might purchase the set, but not too sure about that either.Anyway, this workout involves a simple warm-up, very basic moves, and then a cool-down. Again, I'm not saying the technique was bad. I'm just saying this was the type of video best used by a newby to the world of cardio kicboxing."
4,The Biggest Winner,"I love the workouts except I find Jillian's sense of humor somewhat annoying, which only allows me to give her workouts 4 stars instead of 5 stars."
5,Holy COW!,"I have only done the front side, but it was awesome, can't wait to do the back side tomorrow!"
3,Lose it with Jillian,I have many of the Biggest Loser DVD's and this has been a nice addition to the collection. Even though it is a DVD Jillian makes you feel that she is there watching you so you push yourself as if you were in a class with her.
3,Basic Workout Video,The product was decent but failed to wow. If you've taken a couple of the kickboxing classes at the local gym you've covered most of the basis for this product. The extras advertised are at best dissapointing. Covering again only the most basic info. Up side you only need a step and a couple of light weights to use it at home.
2,Bad DVD,This workout DVD is horrible I purchased it thinking it was going to be a challenging workout because of how Jillian is on the biggest loser. I didn't feel like I got much of a workout with the DVD. During the workout Jill keeps talking about how hard the workout is but it's not hard at all. I don't like the way she keeps going around talking to the people working out in her video. They didn't even look like they were getting a good workout. I only recommend this video to a beginner. If you haven't worked out in years buy this DVD.
1,Unrealistic,"When someone buys this DVD set, it usually means they are weak and overweight. I was physically unable to do half of these exercises, not because I was lazy or unmotivated, but because of my body limitations. For instance, I had to do a plank exercise that made me raise my knee into my chest in a push up position. Well, if you have excessive fat on your abdomen, this moovement is physically impossible to do. I am unable to use this DVD to get fit. I do not recommend it for those who are obese."
2,not too good......,"ALL of her other DVDs are much better! In this DVD, she can't stop laughing and talking about the ladies behind her, completely ignoring the fine men in the DVD. It's just not a very good workout compared to her other ones."
4,The Biggest Winner - How to Win by Losing: 5-Disc DVD Set:,"So far so good...I've done three of the five workouts. What I really like is that they are fairly short (total of about 30 minutes each) and they don't require a lot of equipment (bench, either weight or step--preferably step, and light weights). It doesn't seem like you'd be able to get much out of a 30 minutes, light weight workout, but once you try it you'll believe it. I anticipate using these workouts a lot, especially when I don't have a lot of time. I don't care for some of the silliness, but if that can be overlooked, I'd highly recommend these workouts. And the price of $29.99 can't be beat."
2,Mixed review,The tape set I am sure would be great if I could get a set that had both dvd's that worked. I have ordered 2 sets and both sets have had copies of the backside that did not work. The front side workout is awesome and I have no doubt the second dvd would be great as well if I could get a working copy.
2,TOO HARD,"I FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO HARD TO DO, BECAUSE IF YOU ARE NOT USE TO TRAINING THAT HARD YOU CAN INJURED YOURSELF. THE WARM UP ARE AS HARD AS THE REST OF THE ROUTINE AND YOU ALSO NEED A STEP TO DO A LOT OF THE ROUTINE. I LEARN THAT WHEN I SAW THE FIRST VIDEO AND NO, I DON'T HAVE A STEP. I COMES WITH 5 DIFFERENT ROUTINES SO IT IS GOOD FOR THE MONEY."
2,Focus JILLIAN!,"As always Jillian knows how to rev it up from the start. My only complaint is she tends to joke then pause to laugh, yell at her buddies, then laugh, etc...way too much for my liking. I tried to ignore it but by the time I got to DVD 3 it was annoying the heck out of me. I'm very close to getting these dvds edited to cut out her constant goofing. I rather get an instructor that is focused on the most important person, me, the consumer."
3,Okay,"Like the cardio tape. I run about once a week and do the eliptical machine a lot and I could keep right up with the cardio tape. The other tapes require equipment I don't have such as a step. I don't want to buy a step, so I tried to improvise, but not fun."
3,Tuff workouts,"I have Shape up - Back, Maximize Full frontal, Shape up Front, Back in Action. Two of the dvd's Shape up and Back in action, I did once and I may have been doing something weird with 2.5kgs wieghts but I totally screwed my back up. But the other 2 were great. She is one of those chicks that NEED to be a tuff as the guys. Which is sometimes pretty good, but then can be a bit overbearing. But perservere."
3,good weekday workout - not very intense,"This workout is good if you are limited on time - it's only 30 minutes long, so it's great for weekdays; but it's not very intense or as challenging as I would like it to be. It all depends on what kind of workout your looking for. If I had known, I would have not purchased this DVD because the extra features don't work on a mac."
3,Love Jillian but don't love this!,"I was not impressed by this box set of workouts. First, most of the videos require a step which is not a piece of equipment I own. Second, the workouts didn't seem to be as challenging as I expected. I'm a huge JM fan and have done other videos and this is not my fav at all. I did like the kickboxing video and is the only DVD I used out of the box."
2,NOT CHALLENGING AT ALL,GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!! THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT WORKOUT. THROUGH ALL THE GIGLLING--- I WAS ANNOYED---
1,There are 3 recipes and no bonus workout!!,"I am just blown away that when I looked at the meal plan it totals ONE breakfast, ONE lunch, ONE dinner - yes you heard me!!!The ""bonus"" bikini workout is a copy of her article in a fitness mag! I liked the short (25 min.) workout, but feel so totally ripped off!"
4,Short and Sweat.,I enjoyed this DVD it's only 25 min from start of the workout to the end of the cool down. It really made me sweat and is easy to follow no extra equipment is needed but I use 1.5lb hand and leg weights to add ristance and help me sweat a bit more good cardio for us short in time. Signed Working mom of 3.
3,Working it Hard,"I haven't done the entire workout but Jillian definitely works you. It seems to be a pretty good workout so far. The only thing I don't like is that they give you two options for most workouts. One is for the more experienced or ""fitter"" party and the other is for the beginner or overweight party. But they don't show the beginning exerciser that much. As a beginner you would feel overwhelmed by some of the constant workouts. Not being able to see what to do is frustrating and gives room for disappointment."
2,Only for the advanced person,I am a fitness trainer myself and she does great workouts but they are fast paced. A very over weight person or a beginner would become discouraged. This is not what you want to purchase if you are just starting out.
2,I expect more for the price :(,"i love both jillian & Bob but I should say that the content of the DVD is not worth $29, the work out is good but I think the Bob Harper Dvd that I bought the same time for less than $10 is worth every penny. it will kick you butt! And he will show you good body position every move."
4,Shape up frontal,I found this workout to be a time saver (surprised at how short is was 34 minutes). The workout kept my heart rate high while challenging me. I will continue to work out with Jillian because she pushed me to the max.
2,Didnt like this at all!,Im up to almost any workout on dvd I can do at home. Love this show and it gives me motivation so I thought I would love these. Jillian doesnt always participate in the workout and walks around which bothers me for some reason. There is no music at all in the these except for the kickboxing video. The kickboxing doesnt seem to focus on doing the kicks correctly to avoid injury. The people in the kickboxing just seem to be blah I guess. The weight training I also wasnt impressed with. Im returning this whole set. Very disappointed. I gave it a 2 star rating because it does get your heart rate up but the choreography and organization just sucks
4,Can you hang?,"I am a seasoned exerciser and I can't keep up with her! I gave it 4 stars because if you do it, you WILL see a difference. I had to watch it thru once without doing anything and then at least a few more times doing it to get the hang of it. I have never sweat so much to a DVD, she is great!"
4,quick but effective workout,"The workout only lasts about 25 minutes and I initially thought this was short, but I definitely feel it the next day. I thought it would be more intense (because Jillian seems tough), but it is not that intense and yet it seems to be effective (my whole body is sore!). I wish it had energetic music to go with the workout (and subtitles or close captioning)."
3,The Jury Is Still Out On This One...,"I love Jillian Michaels and her work on The Biggest Loser, but I can't say the same about the DVD's I had purchased. To start off, there is no music to keep any sort of time with (which I found a little hard at first). Also, all the DVD's seem to be very slow-paced...something I personally do not like in a workout.Her methods apparently work, it's just if you buy this product, don't be discouraged if it is not what you are expecting."
4,Pretty Good,"I used to do the Buns of Steel Platinum Series. Obviously that was a while ago. I do not like the Jillian Michaels workouts as well as the ones with Tammy Lee Webb, but for a beginner to an intermediate, these workouts are not bad."
3,Average,"I rate this a three star because I expected a lot from this Biggest Loser CD and although the excercise was rough, it still wasn't the best. I also wanted some excitement in the CD, like adding some music to the routine which wasn't there. All that considered, its still a good video and I would recommend it to others. It served its purposed in my opinion."
5,Great workout!,"I bought the box set because I really love the Biggest Loser workout DVDs and figured Jillian's DVD would be just as great. It is! It is a tough workout which is exactly what I was looking for. The only thing that I'm not fond of is her laughing. It does tend to get annoying. I just turn down the volume. :) I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting a tough workout however, a beginner might find it very challenging."
3,The 6-week plan information is misleading,"The workouts are pretty good, but accessing the ""6-week bikini workout"" and other special features requires a DVDROM to access. It is not an insert like most workout DVDs. All in all, it was enjoyable for a great price."
4,"Great workout, but one thing to note","Glad I bought it. Good deal. HOWEVER, No where on the video does it mention that I'd need a step, but it can be done without a step easily cause she doesn't use it much. Each video is 20-25 minutes and it really does a good job getting your heart rate up in a short amount of time. It's tough, but a beginner could work up to the exercises cause they're basic and advanced exercisers can do 2 or more videos in a session and be beat. No background music to get sick of, great for guys who don't usually do videos and want a change."
3,You must be in shape,"If you are in shape and have been working out now for awhile...this is for you. If you are starting to remodel your life and start a workout program...please don't go for this program. I recommend the Biggest Loser exercise cd instead. After a few months of a serious exercise program, I will consider trying this again."
1,"Off the beat, doesn't flow at all!","I am an instructor myself, bought it to get some more ideas and include some variety in my classes. The choice of exercises was good - probably challenging for an average person who is not physically active. But I cannot believe this whole video/all exercises are completely off the beat - it's not motivating and it doesn't flow. Why bother to have music at all?! Unacceptable for a professional instructor/trainer!"
2,Is she high???,"This was my first (and last) purchase of a Jillian Michaels workout. I was very disappointed, and found many of the moves to be ineffective because of the pace at which you have to do them. For example, doing bicept curls while simultaneously doing jumping jacks just doesn't allow for an effective pace. It felt like I had to rush through the moves just to keep up (and, no, I'm not unfit). I found this to be a problem for a lot of her exercises. Beyond that, I just found her annoying... the way she asks, ""Are you DYING yet???"" And she repeatedly laughs for absolutely no reason. I seriously think she smoked something before filming. What a waste of money (luckily I bought this at Ross for dirt-cheap!)."
2,"no ""uhhhggg, this is working""","jillian is down to earth & definately inspiring for the eyes, but the workout is very short...even one of her students shruggs her shoulders when jill states ""that's it"", as if to say...""really...that's it?"". I am a kickboxer & bought this dvd to do at home when i am not at the studios & felt that the instruction was poor, & the choreography was in peices. Jill's got a bit more work to do in this dvd & so do we if we want results from a real cardio workout....dissappointing."
2,Not worth it,"First of all, 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks. Second of all, I missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain. Also, regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises, it is still moderately difficult."
4,A little too much giggling,"This DVD is ok but I wish I had the chance to figure out what the next workout move will be before we go into it. A lot of times she'll call out the next move, and I'll have no idea what she's talking about until she's actually doing it. Also, she does a whole lot a giggling..It's kinda annoying...but maybe that's me. Still it's a good DVD workout."
3,"Good Cardio Workout, forget about Kickboxing Technique","It is a good little cardio work out tape to mix things up, with her other DVD's. It is not a technicial kickboxing tape. It runs 25 minutes. Jillian knows the technical moves for kickboxing, the rest of the gang do not, in this tape. If you just want a good little cardio work out, this is fine. If you are wanting to learn kickboxing, I'd advise another tape that provides more instruction on the proper body positioning so you can learn the proper kicks."
3,I though it was something it wasnt,I thought is more about focusing on the muscles but it had a lot of cardio that I wasnt interested in. It is hard to find muscle focused workouts with no cardio but I am pretty sure I found it in Jillians no more trouble zones.
3,a bit annoyed,"When i bought this DVD i had no idea that i needed steppers for 4 out of 5 of the workouts. The steppers alone cost about 40 to 80 bucks. they're just a bunch of plastic boxs stacked on top of each other. SO unless you have a stepper don't buy this dvd. if you do, then this dvd does give you quite a work out."
3,"OK Workouts, can get boring...","I really wanted to like these DVD's. I think the exercises are effective but owning 5 DVD's with Jillian gets a bit boring. All the 5 DVD's look the same. Same gym, pretty much the same people, and very similar exercises and music. I bought the box set because I wanted to do a short workout in the mornings before going to work 5 days a week, but there is no way I can do these tapes every day as they can become monotonous.I think having the back and the front is enough. The rest is just the same."
3,Better on mute,"I found this workout to be good in the morning or on a day that I'm feeling a bit worn out. It's still works up a decent sweat, but JM does too many breaks in between moves. She takes breaks to annoyingly stare back at the other people working out with her and I wondered if she was drunk when they filmed this dvd. A bit annoying in that sense, but it's a good dvd to rotate with my other workouts."
5,Literally whips you into shape in no time,"I'm a runner and bought this workout DVD set looking for a way to get some definition and tone. I have been doing it 5-days-a-week for six weeks and still feel a little sore the next day after doing the workouts. I have been amazed at how quickly my arms, butt, and legs toned up. After only 6 weeks, I have an amazing waist line and those cute belly curves are starting to form.The workouts are quick and hard and I feel truly exhausted at the end of each one. If this is your first workout DVD at home, I recommend starting with the Cardio Workout and then trying one of the Shape-Up workouts. And get a step. I did the workouts for the first two weeks without one and noticed a big difference once I got the step.All in all, it was a good purchase and produced very good results very quickly!"
3,"Good, but I've seen better.","This DVD is pretty good, but I didn't like that it only lasted for 25 minutes, and i was very repetitive. I've taken alot of cardio kickboxing classes, and they have always had lots of combinations. This DVD has maybe two, which takes the excitement out of cardio kickboxing. This DVD is best for a supplement to a workout regimine."
5,Jillian Rocks!,Jillian knows what she is talking about! I saw major differences and improvements in my muscle tone and how I felt by doing this program for only 2 weeks (Thats each video twice). It is kind of hard to keep up at first but I promise its worth the effort to get to her pace.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE These videos,"I am sooooo very happy with this purchase. Not only did it get here fast but the results are showing on my body fast. It is very high endurance on your ankles shins and knees if your not used to it though. Lots of jumping. Also, to really do the videos you will need a stepper(preferably a club size because you lay down on it) and light weights! Enjoy it, you will love the results!"
5,awesome set,"Jillian is Hardcore! I recommend the 30 Day Shred that includes three killer workout routines and it's only $10. If you are done with that, this set includes 5 DVDs, each contains only one workout so it could fit in a double DVD set but still they are all really good"
4,lesliev,"This is a good workout, Its challenging. One day do the front and the next do the back. It has a beginners also but the camera does not stay focus on everyone so sometimes you have to guess what the beginner person is doing. Jillian herself does not workout but walk around the others to explain the workout. i would like to see her last through the workout. Other than that its a really good work out. For those who are looking for a tough challenging workout. There is no resting in between so you have to move quick and have everything ready. and I ercommend lots of workout space for a step platform and a mat beside it. you also need hand weights."
4,The Biggest Winner,"I have really enjoyed this product. I am guilty of owning endless workout tapes that are hard to follow,and not very motivating. This DVD is short, but with a great impact with familiar exercises that help burn fat and create energy!"
2,Not a fan,"I bought this because I really like the idea of boxed sets. I read the reviews regarding the instructor's presentation, and thought I could handle it - but I can't! She is sooo annoying and for that reason alone I often opt to choose a different DVD. Surely she doesn't talk like that in real life! The workouts are okay if you like jumping jacks, no warmup and moving quickly while holding weights. All in all, I really wish I had spent my money elsewhere."
5,Already lost over 40 pounds!,"This DVD set is terrific! I started using it in January and am still doing it 5 days a week. I've lost over 40 pounds using these videos. One word of caution, the exercises are not low impact. There is a lot of jumping, lunging and sqatting involved.Each video is approximately 30 minutes. You WILL sweat the whole 30 minutes. Hand weights and an exercise step are needed for all except Cardio Kickbox."
5,Jillian Michaels Workouts ROCK!!,"Okay, I have to say that this whole set is AWESOME! Just motivate yourself to turn on your TV and put on some clothes to work out in and you're good to get in tip-top shape! I recommend this to everyone! Get buff! You can do it! These DVDs will help you bigtime!"
3,Drill Sargeant Style Workout,"Most of the DVDs are advanced workouts (to me). If you need to be pushed hard through a DVD, this will be great for you. The workouts are different. You won't get bored. But in my opinion, if your endurance and pain tolerance isn't high, it can enough to make you give up because the challenge is too great. But, maybe it's like she said, all a mind thing. You have to tell yourself you can do it, because you can. ??. The Cardio Kickbox is my favorite. I get a hard workout in about 30 min and it's doable. The other ones, I break up. Her style will definitely get you sweating and toned. I love that Jillian also has recipes and other extras you can use to enhance your results."
3,You need some equipment for these videos,"I ordered the videos and was very excited about taking my workouts to the next level. I read the box and individual DVD's when thay arrived but did not know until they began to play that they required weights (which I had) and an aerobic step (which I did not have). I improvised but felt that I was wasting my time not having the proper equipment.The videos are tough but appear to gove a good workout so far. Not much warm up / cool down compared to some of the other videos I have done through Prevention. Overall I am excited about the results I expect to get from Jillian's intense work-outs. Dissappointing that she does not do the entire workout, but stops and walks around to make it more difficult for her team."
4,Good Workout,I purchased this set because I was looking to work out and I do not like the gym. I was primarily interested in the kickboxing dvd but found all of the videos to be a fun workout. They actually raised my heart rate and made me sweat a bit. I usually only did one dvd per day.The reasons why I'm not giving this product a 5 star review is because I have taken kickboxing classes (without the use of any equipment) and this dvd did not meet my expectation to the workout. It did not have enough of the kickboxing moves. It was still fun and worked me out though.Also some of the dvds involve a step and weights to do the work out which meant I ended up purchasing more products.Overall I would recommend if you are looking for a quick workout at home.
4,"Too fast paced, even for Jillian.","Most of my workout videos are Jillian's, so I know her style and really enjoy her tough, down to business approach. However, with this set, unlike her stand alone videos, it was extremely fast paced, so fast that once she started each exercise, by the time I got my body set up, about three reps had passed, so I didn't get the required number of reps in. Also, it was so fast I didn't feel like I was in good form, something I think is really important, for safety and to get the most out of each workout. Jillian herself even emphasizes form. It seemed like she was trying to squeeze what is really a 45 minute workout into 30 minutes. If you like Jillian too, I would recommend her strength video No More Trouble Zones or her cardio video Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism over this set."
5,Fun to do!,"I really like this DVD set, the workouts are interesting, not repetitive like some workout videos can be. I found it challenging, and it's great to mix in with my other favorite workout videos. It's a good mix of cardio with strength training, it's like one-stop shopping!"
2,Cardio?,"I have the Cardio kickbox dvd and was very disappointed. The pace of the workout seems very awkward, the instructor doesn't really know what is coming next, and most of all in between each different exercise, she just stops rather than keeping moving during the full amount of time. I did like the different kickboxing moves she used, but they were in such short repetitions- I barely felt that I had been working on it before it was onto the next one, I think I'll just write down the different exercises and do them to my own music."
2,easy to follow but not super hard,I was expecting this to be more difficult as I have taken cardio kickboxing classes here and there over the years. It's easy to follow and will be challenging for beginner exercisers but not a killer workout for those in decent shape. The other Biggest Loser Cardiomax tape is MUCH more intense.
4,Great Music still happens,"Scott McClatchy had produced another very fine record. Mature songwriting and inspired performances throughout. Guest appearances by Dion, Willie Nile and Scott Kempner on The Weight only add to an already complete set of songs.It is so refreshing to discover an emerging artist writing and performing music this immediate and vital.Think of Steve Earle, Wilco, and John Hiatt. Scott is a peer."
1,A not reliable drive,"I bought it for 16 months but did not use it until 8 months ago to store my research data. The swing design for the USB adaptor started to break within a few weeks. It crashed a few days ago and the data could not be recovered. The service center asked me to keep trying on different computers as the only solution but it did not work. Now I have to back up all the research data on 2 or 3 flask drives after this bad experience. Do not need to waste the time to contact the service center since they can not help you either. The quality of the service is very much like the USCIS service center, it is there to show that they will help you but they are actually not."
3,Are You Feeling Lucky?,"I have been using this device for several months now. The first time I used it, it became unusually hot. Since then, I have not left it connected longer than it takes to transfer my files and have had no problems with any of the reliability issues that others have described. There may be better products out there for the price. Read the reviews and decide for yourself."
2,worked hotly for 22 months!,Never had any problems for 22 months....I loved this huge portable drive except for its heat-- I would always let it cool somewhat before storing it back in its case; I figured the heat was okay as long it was out in the open air...until the day no computer would detect it! I never used the twisting/swivel option on the connector up until a couple months ago because I figured the constant twisting back & forth on the wires COULDN'T be good for them--and then only because someone I was working for twisted it to that 90' angle before I could get the extension cord out to use-- so maybe this has something to do with it....
1,don't buy this product,"It only lasts for one day,I can't believe how fast it dies. The first time I used it, it got very hot and for some reason it caused my machine to run very slowly."
1,Windows 98SE a no show,"Contrary to company documentation, this device does not work with Windows 98SE. I tried repeatedly using both the supplied driver and the driver that I downloaded from their website. Not only does it not work, but it shuts down my computer. I have all the minimal essential requirements necessary including a USB 2.0 port but Windows will not run it and calls it a generic device. I consider this pure junk."
3,Sparkling in the details,"Nothing Lost contains all the right elements: a good plot, good characters, weighty themes, and fine sentence-by-sentence writing. Unfortunately, these elements do not coalesce into an excellent novel. The book is, finally, a hash. Plot lines are disjunct; speaking voices are unidentifiable; transitions are often nonexistent. It feels as if someone took a great novel, threw the pages into the air and then printed the clumps that came down together in no particular order. Dunne did not see the book through to final page proofs, but a strong editorial hand could have made this book competitive with True Confessions, Dunne's masterpiece in fiction.Having said that, I must also say that I finished it and that I enjoyed it and that I admire its constituent elements. It is sad that the book's narrative potential was not reached."
2,An Interesting Mess,"According to the NY Times Dunne died when this book was in galleys. I find this hard to believe, as the book is a sprawl of undigested plot devices, confusing narrative POVS, three or four characters all with similar sensibilities making it hard to tell them apart. I'm sure John, had he lived, would have tightened the book before it got to galleys.But even for its problems it's a J.G. Dunne book, and a pleasure. No novelist knows his way around a courtroom better. The story of the racially charged murder on the prairie is very good (though the book's extraneity makes you wait a long time for the good parts). Recommend with serious reservations."
2,Nothing Lost except the time to read this book,"I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings."
1,E for effort,"Lists about this book:1. People the author doesn't like (and it shows): Midwesterners, Republicans, football players and coaches, prosecutors, people who live in mobile homes, Vietnam veterans, prison guards, TV reporters, models, bodyguards, cops, the entire population of Las Vegas and Hollywood.2. People the author pretends to like, but his scorn shows through: Gays.3. Silly plot tricks: Far to numerous to mention. Several years ago the National Lampoon did a satire on how to write a novel, recommending that if you wrote your characters into a blind alley with no way forward, you should just end your book by saying ""Suddenly, he was run over by a bus"". The author seems to have taken that advice, not realizing it was satire. This is a book that has no ending, but just stops. Waste of money; avoid."
5,Love this little saucepot!,"It is great! This does have the cool-v handles, they are just the short ones. It is a pot, not a pan! Anyway, the steamer is wonderful too! Broccoli never tasted so good! The nice thing is that the steamer also fits other Calphalon saucepans making it versitle. You won't regret purchasing this set! Enjoy!"
5,Ruthless 4 life,"I can't agree with the first review mc ren is one of the best rappers ever and way underated, and it has to be said this is some of his best work, gut is even better in 'hello' check the nwa album when it comes out, peace."
1,Boring and obvious,"Characters were cliched, jokes were dumb and obvious. Plot line was non-existent. Glad this was a library book and I did not spend money on it"
5,Overcompensation on My Part,I love these books. I really like the normalness of this novel I guess. It's not some fantastical story with demons have sex with pretty boys. It's an as true to life story as you'll get. I can;t say anything on the poor translation quality. My mind overcompensates and fixes most typos and syntax erors automatically. Ona few occasions I had to stop but if you're like me you shouldn't have any trouble.
3,Wrong one,I gave my order a three star because I got the manga instead of the novel. I mean it's fine but I read the manga already so I wanted to read the novel. So I was a bit dissapointed when I got the manga instead.
2,This edition is not recommended,"The narration of this version is over-acted, lacking the quiet contemplative atmosphere fitting a text of this magnatude and importance. The speaker seems to be more of a ""new-ager"" type than a spiritual seeker. The narration tends to distract from the message of the text. The translation is a bit over the top as well, being done in an old time King James-ish style with lots of thy's and and thou's thrown in to perhaps make it seem more legitimate to western ears for the time that it was translated (1940's or 50's?). Download the out of print version with Jacob Needleman as the narrator from audible.com. It's truer to the message of this holy book"
5,"..how Red Army beat Nazis,& what terrible cost-Victory","Thurston is history professor at Miami U.,Ohio,his books include: ""life & terror in Stalin's Russia"".(1996)..which might be considered subtitle for this well documented book. Of 5.74 million Soviet POW's, an estimed 60% died in prisons by end 1941. Stalin refused aid to all POWs held..even his own son. Contributors include German & Russian top scholars."
4,Great vac!,"Great suction, great maneuvering, nice and light! For a home that is mostly hard-surfaces and some low pile carpeting this is a fantastic lil vacuum. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because the cord is way too short... other than that it's just fantastic!"
3,A good beginning...,"Ms Strumpf's book is an interesting mix of travelogue and beginner's guide to collecting Limoges boxes. Her section on the city of Limoges is very well done and interesting, and not readily available elsewhere. Additionally, her basic information on the boxes and tips for collectors is quite useful to someone just starting out, or without an in-depth background. There were some disappointments in her book, however. For example, her bibliography is quite extensive, but there are some glaring and important omissions, such as the Sonking and Waterbrook-Clyde books. Her photographs are lovely, but the captions give no pertinent information regarding size, manufacturer, etc. And her history of Limoges porcelain is a retelling of local legends rather than grounded in detailed history. Again, this is a very good resource for someone newly interested in the boxes, but a serious collector may find it a little light weight."
1,Big Disappointment. Save Your Money.,"This is a very silly book, with really no insights into the quality of decoration or how one should really go about selecting Limoges boxes. The photographs are just awful--many are out of focus and the author chose, for the most part, boxes of very poor decorating quality. The text for each box is just descriptive; in other words, the author just describes what you can see in the photos. There are no company names and measurements. The text is written at a level to appeal to young children. Save your money."
3,Not good for homes with wireless phone and routers,If you have a 2.4Ghz Cordless phone or a Wireless router then do not buy this. You will see a lot of disturbance. If you do not have any of these then this is a very good Monitoring camera.
5,Easy,"The key word in this review is easy. In 5 mins I was all hooked up and ready to go. Sharing files, internet, and printers all of it was very easy. So far it is working great with my DSL internet connection providing speed to both computers."
3,A good volume - but snobbery abounds,"Lacey has produced a well-written expose on the hidden world of auctioneering and art. However, the snobbery (and bigotry) that he goes out of his way to illustrate seems to leak into his prose. I almost fell out of my chair when he compared the appearance of one of the Sotheby's directors to that of a ""Red Indian"" and the numerous references to who was Jewish and who wasn't goes above and beyond pointing out the anti-semitism inherent in the WASP dominated art world. That said, I did find much of the restructuring of the company in the 80s and 90s to be very interesting from a business standpoint and Lacey does draw compelling characters (and he has plenty to draw from)."
4,What a difference!,"When I bought this, I thought it wasn't going to work on my face. I had large pimples and I was deperate to try anything. So ehen I say this product, I thought ""Why not give it try?"" It worked really well on my face. It reduces all of my pores and my face is much more clearer than it use to be. If you need something to get rid of pores, try this product."
5,Great Product!,This product is easy to use and provides immediate results! Neutrogena skin care products are a good investment for your face! If refining your poors is something that is an issue for you then this is a product for you to try.
3,Not a jazz singer,"Although Jane Monheit has a lovely voice, I find it amazing that she has been touted as a jazz singer, which she most certainly is not. In fact, I find her singing of the standards lacking insomuch as she seems not to deeply understand them and, perhaps due to her youth, is unable to communicate them fully. Singers such as Diana Krall, Paula West and Faith Winthrop (among others) should be listend to by those who want to know what a jazz singer should sound like - it is all about phrasing.Having seen her live, I can say that she is far better singing songs from the canon of people like Joni Mitchell than she is the songs of Sinatra, Holiday, et al.That said, Monheit can be enjoyed for what she is - a vocalist with a degree of warmth which I am sure will develop over time."
4,Grows on you,"This album is like a great glass of wine... the more you taste it, the moreflavors and experiences unfold... or a painting that reveals more and moreeach time you look at it... or a wonderful poem that imparts more meaningand feeling with each reread... or like... a great album that ... well...you know....."
2,Engineering and mixing stinks!,"I like the music, there seems to be a lot of good backing...however, Jane's voice sounds different on every single track -Too much EQ (thin and whiney):(1) Just Squeeze Me(2) No More Blues (Chega De Saudade)(5) Cheek to Cheek(8) Comecar de Novo(9) It Never Entered My MindToo much compression/processing (flat, lifeless):(3) Once I Walked In The Sun(7) Love Has no Pride(11) Since You've AskedJust right (full sweet vocals):(4) Some Other Time(6) Tea For Two(10) No Haunted Heart"
1,SHE IS NOT 23!!,"She has been 23 for the last 3 years, people. She's way overrated and belongs on broadway, not a jazz recording."
2,Spotty and Eratic,"Many will say this is the bold and daring effort of a jazz singer coming into her own. Standard critic speak for a spotty effort that is a great disappointment. The song choices are all over the board, there is no sense of cohesiveness, and please, please leave Linda Ronstadt songs for Linda, you just don't have the chops for her tunes.Don't buy this one, wait until she matures and realizes her true strengths; and has the artistic wisdom to return to that which she does best."
3,"nice vocals, bad recording","Growing up with Jane you could always get a free show. She had a voice that could blow you away in kindergarten. Always an amazing talent to listen to. So when I heard she was releasing CDs I had to get them. Still the same beautiful voice, if not even better, but the recordings were horrible. So tinny and unbuffered it hurts to hear those amazing notes she can hit that you relish to hear her sing in person. Such a disappointment to have a beautiful voice ruined by misuse of recording equipment."
2,"Great voice, but BORING album","I enjoyed most of the songs from her first two albums. While her voice sounds just as good on this one, the selection of songs makes the purchase of this album regrettable."
3,The More the Jazz the Less the Swing,"If someone asked me to send back one of todays female jazz singers back to the 1940's, it would be Jane Monheit. Her voice has the capability to bounce and swing like Ella Fitzgeralds as well as having a full, round, warm sound.That is why this album was such a shock. She sounds like she has been listening to too much Dianna Krall. Krall is an extremely talented and technically superb jazz singer but has a much different voice quality than MonheitYoung or not, Monheit has superb phrasing, tone, and a voice quality that surpasses all other popular female jazz singers today. Her full abilities are poorly showcased by this album, as her sound is less rich and colorful.Monheit's In The Sun features a diverse selection of numbers, standards and new jazz, but lacks the pizzaz of her earlier albums. I look forward to hearing her next effort and hope that she remembers to concentrate as much on her History as on her Marketing homework."
2,Trying to be Krall..Not Jazz here....,Ms Monheits previous recordings showed true potential. Unfortunately this disc follows in the too familiar (and boring) footsteps of Krall and others trying to cross over into mainstream pop. Not really a Jazz vocal CD more easy listening and at that is succeeds. Little to no passion or depth here.Ncoded continue to offer well recoreded discs though.
1,She makes Diana Krall sound soulful,"Having heard much about this young singer, I was looking forward to hearing this CD....maybe I shouldn't have started with this one, but after doing so, I've lost the urge to go back to any of her previous albums.The song selections are eclectic, and a singer with more depth and originality might be able to pull it off. Sorry, Ms Monheit can't. She sounds more like a Broadway bitpart singer than a recording artist, oversinging what little role she's got, and completely tiring out the listener.There are a few exceptions here and there...Tea For Two is a nice treatment, but hope is raised only to be crushed at the next instant, in this case by the worst version I've heard of Love Has No Pride. (BTW, Bonnie Raitt, NOT Linda Ronstadt, did the definitive version.)I think the production by Joel Dorn is competent and the musicians are fine. It is actually quite a good album if you listen past the vocals, which makes it kind of pointless."
1,UNFORTUNATE,"There are so many other jazz singers that surpass Ms Monheit not so much in vocal ability but more in feel for the songs and the music. She just leaves me feeling so very cold. I got this one on the second hand option with amazon so glad I did I would have been dissapointeed even more if I had paid full price.Her high pitch tone on this cd is hard on the ear, also the slang lazy sounding diction that she uses gets very annoying, maybe she is trying to sound cool im not sure. If u like the songs on this cd search them out by by better vocal interpreters..If I had ms Monheits address I think Id be happy to pay the postage and send this one back to her."
2,Good sweet voice but no soul,"Good sweet voice, but no substance.Actually I think Ms Monheitmight be a better country western singer then a jazz singer.This CD left me cold. Can't recommend it"
5,"once again Monheit proves she has ""chops""","From softly caressing her voice around a lyric to soaring to maximum full voice - she is in complete control of her talent. I have all three of her CD's, and this one is the most ambitious.From the bouncy ""Cheek to Cheek"", the soulful ""It Never Entered My Mind"" and her Brazil inspired ""Chega de Saudade"" and ""Comecar de Novo"" - Ms. Monheit is a delightful refreshment to be enjoyed in all kinds of moods."
1,Sappy and boring,"Wow. What a dose of sibilant S's. You could choke on them. I appreciate that Ms. Monheit has a pretty voice but man, is she boring and affected. She should try again in about 20 years. Kids, this is not jazz!!"
1,Dissappointed,"Dissappointed is the only word for this album.Beautiful voice, waste of talent and time here folks.Whoever mixed the CD in the soundstage should not be in the business. As an example, listen to the Cheek to Cheek song - it just sounds ""tinny"" - spectrum of instruments have been cut and the song sounds like its coming out of a portable AM radio."
4,Another strong piece of work from a fabulous artist,"Although I dont crave listening to this CD from beginning to end like I do with ""Come Dream with Me"", it is still a wonderful offering. Ms. Monheit continues to show her depth and abilities as she grows into her music.My impression of this CD is that Ms. Monheit became a little more introspective in delivering these works. I think we are being given a glimpse into her true identity and soul. I think this album is great, but would recommend ""Come Dream with Me"" to any newcomers to her music."
2,Poor sound,"I wanted a wired headset for my cellphone. First I bought a Razorfish for $20 from the nearby BestBuy. Then I ordered this from Amazon.The Plantronics is much more comfortable to wear, but...the sound quality, for both speaking and listening, is much better on the Razorfish."
1,not worth the praise,"This product was given very good reviews by others, but was very poor quality for me. To me, callers sounded distant. While, to others, there was bad background static and I sounded like I was on Mars. I returned this product immediately!"
4,Great Noise reduction,"I bought this recently along with the DA45 USB to test for making online lectures. The house I record in is usually quite loud, so it usually makes the recording process absolute insanity.With these headphones, the noise is reduced considerably. I made tests with the tv volume up to 35, with people making noise around, and yet 95% of it was inaudible..The only thing that I have with it is that the quality of the recordings is quite poor compared to my Blue Yeti.The H251N is very comfortable to wear."
5,Best Headset on the Market!,Plantronics makes the best headset. It is very sleek and has a lightweight design. It has noise cancellation for superior call clarity!
5,Great basic corded headset,"There's nothing flashy about this little unit, but it does everything you'd want a corded headset to do. The mic boom is infinitely adjustable and renders voice clearly and without noise. Reproduction in the earpiece is clean, as well, and accurate. A great improvement over the workhorse Supra by Plantronics."
5,Excellent Headset,"This is an excellent headset: comfortable, adjustable in all the right places, and the sound quality is great. You can hear the other side well and they can hear you well through this headset.You MUST use an A10 quick disconnect cord. I used an older quick disconnect cord and had issues. Plantronics customer service was immediately able to figure out what the problem was, and after purchasing an A10 cord, have no problems at all. I am using this headset and an A10 quick disconnect cord with a ShoreTel 230 phone and after 2 months, am getting no complaints."
1,Very Poor Quality DVD,"I have probably bought all the Kurt Cobain documentary/biographical DVD's available and this has got to be the poorest one I have bought so far. The quality is absolutely pathetic, it is very amateurish and what is most frustrating is the fact that the audio is not even in sync with the video. The content is also not very well researched and is not always factually correct. Not sure how crap like this make it onto amazon. Don't buy it, you will waste your money."
1,incorrect product description,"This is a 2nd Gen iPod nano case, not a 3rd Gen. When I oredered this the first time around, they had a picture of a 3rd Gen case and it was labeled as such as well, but they sent me a 2nd Gen. Be careful!"
5,"Children & imagination, a magical book","This is one of the best books for parent and child. It is so full of images and relationships between letters, words and what they stand for that every approach is filled with new discoveries. I spent many hours with my children 30 years ago and is was a joy to see my son and grandson enjoy it again."
5,Beautiful,This is a replacement book for my grown kids who love it as children. So happy to find it in such good condition - what a great Christmas gift!
3,Narrow spectrum,"Unfortunately I purchased this book with the wrong expectations. It deals with how managers can train their employees within the spectrum of HRD. If you need a text with a more general and contextual outlook on HRD, you need to look elsewhere. If you're an entrepreneur or manager and you're looking for advice in how to manage and derive the best from your employees, then you can give this book a try."
1,BIG MISTAKE,"I ordered: Best of Saturday Night Live (1975) and instead I got the Best of Saturday Night Live from 1992. The description says 1975, yet my order form came out 1992, and the video I received is from 1992. I didn't think to check the order form for 1975. There is obviously an error on the website, since they list something from 1992 as 1975. DO NOT ORDER THIS TAPE IF YOU WANT THE BEST OF SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE FROM 1975."
3,Just the Facts,"You can get the basic facts from Sinclair's book, and get them quickly. If that's what you're after, then this is the book you want. But for anything like in depth coverage of Che's life, you'll have to look elsewhere. One also wonders at some of the claims Sinclair makes in the final chapter. He maintains, for example, that the global unrest of 1968 was in large part a response to the death of Che the previous year. While Che has been (and continues to be) an inspirational figure for the left, this seems like an overstatement to me."
2,Mine has a leak,"I bought this carafe because I loved the way it looks. However, when I tried to use it the first time, I discovered that it leaks from the top half of the carafe. There is no visible crack in it so I think it is leaking from the seam. I cannot return the item so am now trying to figure out how to repair the leak so that I can use it."
1,appalled,"I was appalled when I received the sweatshirt. Extremely poor quality, thin. Smaller size than what it says. 14/16 looks more like 10/12. One wash and it will shrink, not to mention the iron-on print. I was definitely take for a ride. Extremely frustrated and disappointed. Even the color of the sweatshirt is deceiving!!!!"
2,Poor picture quality due to interference,"The ease of setup and operation of this unit and the quality of the image from the camera (which is good) could not make up for the fact that the poor signal quality renders the good points irrelevant. At any distance greater than 3 or 4 feet between the camera and receiver, the image becomes so unstable as to be barely discernible. Marked by white interference lines, static and jumpiness, the image quality of the installed system was not acceptable for my application in my environment.I did try unplugging all of my cordless phones as well as my wireless router and all wireless PCs but there was no effect on the signal quality.Obviously this unit works well for some people in their environment if the reviews are to be believed. I would be sure you purchase from Amazon so that you can easily return it if need be."
1,Heavy white stripes,"I got this one for my porch two days ago. As a first try I set up everything in my living room, with the camera on the fireplace mantel and the receiver box on my TV stand and connected to the TV. The setup was extremely easy, but right away I got intense white stripes rolling continuously across the screen. The camera was 7 ft away from the receiver box with nothing in between, and all 3 channels had the same problem. Eventually I figured out that the receiver box needed to be closer than 1 ft from the camera for the stripes to go away! This is insane! My guess is that it was caused by inteference from wireless networks around my apartment, even though I myself don't have wireless, and turning my cell phone off did not make any difference. I'm returning it today and getting a 1.2 GHz one instead."
4,Great for the price,"Shipped on time, pretty clear picture for something wireless(Same as wired). Sometimes you get a lot of interference while you walk in the path of the signal, but I can't complain for the price and ease of installation. No Interference with other wireless products. Night vision and the ability to turn off microphone would have been a plus for versility. You need to play with the tuning and receiver location a little, but I would definitely purchase again. Signal goes through several layers of walls and probably 50-75 feet just fine. Thanks!"
4,Excellent little camera but drains battery quickly,"Great little camera for the money. Wireless is a plus, I purchased two, one to monitor my mother who is recovering from surgery, and one to see who's at the door. Works great for both.Pros: SmallHooks up to TV(I have PIP capability and this camera is perfect for use with that.WirelessDecent range although I've heard you can build a patch antenna that will improve range and clarity.Cons: Camera drains 9 volt battery rather quickly, best used hooked up to ac battery eliminator."
5,Great deal !,This camera is a great deal and they have a good quality. they are small and can be placed any where. They have already payed for them selfs by catching a theif that was breaking in to a neighbors house. Good deal for the money.
5,Nice and practical PC camera,"Prompt attention and rapid delivery. The camera works perfectly for what they describe and has unexpected quality for so low price. I enjoyed using it, since it was out of its box. I will buy again from this seller."
2,Only one channel barely works...poor picture quality - no audio!,"While I admit this product is compact and easy to use, it has major problems: picture quality is poor (it needs lots of light); reception only works on one channel (possibly due to interference, but who doesn't have wireless internet these days?); so I can't even buy another camera since the other two channels provide almost no reception; even on that one channel the reception is barely acceptable (frequent white stripes accross the image). Secondly, the small camera does not transmit audio, which is dissapointing since the receiver does have audio output!"
4,Good product with one minor flaw,"I have been looking for a pan of this size to complete my Calphalon set. I like the pan, however, it has one minor flaw from my standpoint. The Lid gets to hot handle after just a minute or so of cooking. All my other pans, the lid handle stays cool or takes a long time to heat up.I keep burning my fingers, I guess it will take time for me to remember to use a towel to move the lid."
4,Sauce pan for Elsie (with apologies to Edward Gorey),"I bought this for a sample of Simply Calphalon with some trepidation, but at the price I figured ""what the heck"". I'm really pleased with this pan. Great size for polenta or risotto, the deep straight sides make it difficult to splash the contents on the stove, but I managed anyway. The best thing is the clean up, a swish of the sponge and it's ready to use again! I'd have given it 5 stars except for the lid which gets really hot. Not a biggie, since I don't usually cook things covered anyway. Also, made in China not Toledo like my other Calphalon stuff. All in all a great saucepan worth every penny. Now if Elsie will just stop screaming...if you haven't read Edward Gorey's ""The Curious Sofa"" get a copy and read it now. (Also in the ""Amphigorey"" anthology.)"
2,"good for actual use, but not for implied use....","while this saucepan is good in the kitchen, it does not really fit the needs of today's serious kitchenware collector. for example, i was shocked to find out that it doesn't come with a certificate of authenticity! however, if you are an amateur collector of pots and pans, though, this could be a nice introduction to the lucrative field of utensil dealing and trading."
1,Awful,"After months of paper jams and stalled print cartridges, my printer doesn't respond at all anymore when I send it documents to print. What a waste of money. Buy a Lexmark."
5,The best book in the history of mankind as whole,Calvin and Hobbes is the best comic in the history ofmankind. The brilliance of Bill Waterson is displayed in this series of breathtaking books worthy of worship. To say this is the best book ever would be a understatment. Buy it now or your life will be as fullfilling as it could be. This book would be worth its wieght in gold 500 times over.
1,Not Book in Picture,"The book I got was of good quality however it was not the book that was pictured for the item, I was looking for the very simple front cover image and instead got a full color book under the same title?"
5,Fun from a book,"Another round of adventures with Calvin & Hobbes. You will see and read page after page of their funny situations, serious considerations and down right impossible but enjoyable escapades!"
4,The Essential Calvin and Hobbes,"Purchased for my grandson, not only to help him read, but also to make him laugh instead of playing video games constantly."
4,"Decent lube, applicator needs work","This lube works well for me in a wet and dry environment. The one thing that I didn't like so well was the applicator (bottle). The tip feels just a tad large (too much comes out with gravity) and the cap situation is awkward. Even so, I might consider purchasing again."
3,OK for a cheap padlock,"This padlock certainly looks and feels intimidating, but just go to youtube and you will find every type of MasterLock being picked quickly. It seems like locks such as this one, labeled ""High Security"", require a lockpicking kit, at least.You have to spend a lot more money to get a more pick resistant lock, so for the price, it seems OK. I wish I could afford to buy something that can't be bypassed in 20 seconds or less."
2,Overkill!,"I should have saved the packaging to return this monster. The shaft is way too thick to fit through the lock, and it's gigantic and heavy. Great product for locking up something industrial, but not at all what I needed."
5,Great finger pull bit,"I bought several other bits to do my cabinet drawers and doors. I wanted a simple look, but the other bits cut a profile on the face and I didn't like the feel of the finger pull portion. I found this bit and decided to give it a try based on the other reviews. It was exactly what I was looking for. Cuts great, especially across the end grain, and gives a nice simple, clean looking profile on the face (1/4 round) and the finger pull feels really nice. I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,Christ-like living,"When Jesus was asked what was the greatest commandment, his response was, ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart and your soul...And love your neighbor as yourself.""This is a book for anyone who is seeking to live out his/her Christian life. This is a book for anyone who seeks to strengthen this vertical and horizontal relationship with God. Dorothy C. Bass and her colleagues have given the readers practical ways to practice their Christian faith. If you have ever wonder what can you do for others as a Christian, read thhis book. We all hear people said, you talk the talk, but can you walk the walk? This is the book that incorported basic things we can live out our Christian life."
5,Inspiring!,"We are using this book currently for a class at my seminary entitled Spirituality, Autobiography & Ministry.The care and depth of thought that permeates this book is apparent from the first pages, and it has been a struggle to resist the urge to ""read ahead"" of the rest of the class in this book.While the chapters are written by different individuals, it is apparent that they have a common understanding and it is quite an achievement that they speak in this book with a common voice.If you read no other book this year, read this one!"
3,"Decent remix, BUT...","what really makes this disc worth getting (if you can find it)is the song ""Dance No More"". An awsome club song that had me thinking it was 1985 again! The UK remix of the Safety Dance was ok, but really nothing special. The one reviewer was correct, though about track three. First, it's just the extended dance version that can be found on any greatest hits discs. But the offending thing is it doesn't even sound like Men Without Hats (maybe it is, but I don't think so!). So buy it, if you can find it for a decent price, for Dance No More and the UK remix."
5,Sons of God,Received in good time. Was a very interesting book that I would recommend to anyone who wanted more information about themselves.
1,too much ranting and raving,"This book is not recommended for those who are delving fully into Mind and our true lofty Identity as Children of the Mother/father God, more of a biographical and mental expediton of the author's experiences and perceptions of the events in her life."
5,Humble truth depicted in this dimension,Read with approved book from heaven. Truly past down knowledge from above and with support to Annalee Skarin work's.
5,Westerberg DVD,"Buy this now if you are a fan! The footage ranges from excellent broadcast quality to hand-held grainy video but what is captured is pure Westerberg in all his ragged glory. The sound quality is ok depending on the original source of the footage. Most of the songs are live in their entirety but some of the songs are cut short by edits especially ""Alex Chilton"" and ""Never Mind"". Also in-store performances at Tower, Amoeba and Virgin are shown. There is a lot of backstage footage of Paul getting ready and several interviews with Paul talking about Bob Stinson and record company hassles. It's cool to see his pre-performance demeanor. Also there are some performances of Paul in his studio and several ""videos"" of new songs. All in all a great dvd for Replacements/Westerberg fans and those just discovering them/him."
4,like and dislikes,"I have had one for several years, but my last one was orange, which was good because when I'm running conduit I can look up or down and see that I have left the level,but with this one, I will have to pay better attention to where the lever is, because it blends in."
1,"Looks nice, poor performance","Bought this because of price and advertised accuracy.I should have known at this price, I wasn't going toget much use of it.Even in a shady location, the beam could only be seenat maybe 1 inch from the tool. Obviously not very helpful.Immediately returned...thanks Amazon. Shame on Johnson,for selling something of such limited usefulness. :-("
5,"Run, do not walk, to this book.","One of the most important books of poetry to ever cross my path. I return to this constantly. Earnest, real, vivid -- none of these words suffice to how incredible this book is. Get on it."
3,He's not my kind of poet.,I do like some of them but mostly I have trouble understanding exactly what he is saying. Reading his poetry is similar to looking at particularly difficult abstract art. I bought this book because I had heard one of his poems and was blown away by the subject matter and the wording.
3,One Of Three,"Not realizing this was a trilogy, I read Six Bad Things first. I then read Caught Stealing and although I really like the story as a whole, I felt that this first book isn't as good as the second. That's probably because the characters weren't fully formed. Still, if you plan on reading all three, do start with this one."
4,Fabulously violent,"If profanity offends, don't buy this book ... otherwise, DO buy it and enjoy a terrific, wry romp of a novel. Huston's anti-hero is a victim of a set of increasingly ludicrous accidents, but the story is told with such a definitive voice and with the such humor that I found myself cringing at the bloodshed while simultaneously chuckling to myself. Great read."
4,A little violent at times but a good read,Although the violence was a bit much at times overall I thought it had a good pace and was easy to read. Despite the stupid decisions at times I ended up liking the character in the end.
1,Dumb,"His books are dumb & childish, foul mouth & stupid stories.I guess you get what you pay for, free. I can see why. Who buys this trash?"
4,Outstanding Debut,"Just discovered Charlie Huston and will definitley be reading more. Caught Stealing is reminiscent of early Pelecanos with a dose of the New York vibe of Richard Price. Yes, that is high praise. If you like dark noirish novels where the main character in on an uncontrollable downward spiral, then this is for you."
4,Pure adrenaline,"Huston's debut novel is 300 pages of pure adrenaline. By turns funny and disturbing, and sometimes surprisingly touching."
5,Completely unexpected and underrated!,"I bought this book based on an ""Amazon Recommends"" posting. I love John Sandford, Patricia Cornwell (well, used to anyway), Dean Koontz and others and the book was recommended due to my previous Amazon purchases.""Caught Stealing"" is not at all like my usual favorites but I am so glad that I tried it. I have since read the other 2 books in the trilogy and am about to start on Mr. Huston's next series.The book is raw - lots of violence, vivid imagery, rough language. Don't read it if this will offend you. If, however, you are not easily offended, the ""hero"", Hank, will pull you in and have you by the throat as he tries to survive one deadly confrontation after another.Mr. Huston also writes the ""Moon Knight"" comics and that fits with the style of writing you find in his book. Overall, this is a true find if you are looking for a new voice that doesn't write formulaic mysteries or thrillers.Hope you enjoy them as much as I did."
1,Caught Stealing - free download,"Caught Stealing by Charlie Huston. I downloaded this book free to my Kindle in hopes of finding more authors whose work I like. Unfortunately, this book falls far short. I certainly won't be reading the two others in the series, even at no cost.This book's language is foul and repetitive. Constantly F this and F that. I'm a corrections officer, and my inmates don't speak that badly. The plot is beyond far-fetched. The writing style is staccato, with some sentences consisting of only ""I. I. I."" This book was a struggle to get through, and wasn't worth the effort."
2,No elaborate plot here.,"Although I did enjoy the witty and somewhat comical thought processes of Huston's Hank Thompson in the beginning, the language and violence were too over-the-top as the book progressed. Having the main character constantly getting the hell beat out of him and having his closest friends killed around him did not make for the thrilling plot I was seeking when I ordered the book. Huston's Hank Thompson went from likable, to pitiful, to pathetic ... In the end Hank turned into a mastermind avenger that wasn't ""caught stealing."" Elaborate plots, twists and turns were replaced with unnecessary violence and language. I have definitely read much more thrilling thrillers. I didn't hate the book, but I doubt I will be reading any more of Charlie Huston."
2,No value even though book is given away,"I can usually get through any book and find something of value in it. Not this one. It was what many other reviewers have said - pointlessly violent and crude and stupidly plotted. For me though the surprise was how annoyed I became at the main character/author while reading this book. I had absolutely zero interest in things working out for the main character, and I just could not wait for it to be over. Why didn't I just stop reading? Given the number of books by this author which were free Kindle downloads, I kept waiting for it to get better, but it never did. I guess if you are in to the Quentin Tarantino blood-guts-violence with little or no plot, go for this book and author. As for me, I am glad this was a free download. I will surely not be spending money on this author in the future."
2,Pretty ugly stuff,"Actually, the F word doesn't bother me; the animal torture did. The main character is indeed a self-absorbed jerk. I am certain there are plenty of real-life killers out there that like cats, and call mom once in a while. A better yardstick might be to take a look at what has happened to Hank's ""friends"" by the time you turn the last page. The writing is pretentious and vicious. And boring; I ended up skimming the last 100 pages. However, there are clearly some people who like this ""flawed"" hero stuff, so more power to them. I tossed the next two Huston works in the trash unread. Back to SJ Rozan, Sean Doolittle and Michael Connelly for me."
2,I got thru it...,"This is my first Houston novel and likely my last. I liked the start but the writing style wore on me as it continued. As others have mentioned the violence was a constant flow to the point that it was absurdly overdone. It was a story that was myopically focused with not surprises, twist to turns. It doesn't lead the reader into contemplation or thought. In that regard it was an easy read - too easy. I was looking for a new author but Houston is not it."
4,Terrific beginning to the Trilogy,"This book is the first in a Trilogy, but it's also a stand alone.You will read other reviews complaining about bad language, violence, etc. Yes, it's all here in this book.That's because bad language DOES exist in the real world. This book is very realistic in its setting & portayal of characters. No, they may not be like the people you live next door to, but these types of people DO exist."
5,un.real,Easily the greatest suspense novel ive ever read. I just hope Quentin tarantino gets his hands on this. An engaging and believable account of what can happen when a simple man is pushed too hard against the wall.
3,For a cat?,"The beatings our hero takes and survives, qualify him as a superhero. An interesting collection of bad guys and lowlifes keep interest high. And when he's mad, vengence is swift. Enough reason to look for the follow-up."
5,"Fast paced, violent, raw, and still very fun.","Hank Thompson is a regular law abiding guy with some original, yet regular problems. While at work one evening, bartending in Manhattan, he is beaten up by two Russian thugs. He soon realizes that this wasn't really about the drinks he served. Hank becomes an infamous and wanted criminal when fate brings a line-up of bad guys chasing after him, all of which are after something that doesn't even belong to him.Caught Stealing is the first book in the Hank Thompson trilogy, and the first novel I've ever read written by Charlie Huston. It was violent, fast paced, and at times, funny, very funny. The prose read quick and easy, even without quotation marks. Certainly, this will not be my last Charlie Huston novel. Can't wait to find out what happens to this likable protagonist in the next addition."
2,Not For Me...,This book just wasn't for me. I didn't like the wording nor did I care for the dialogue. The plot was just so so.
3,couldn't put it down,"Well written dialog, engaging/memorable characters and a exciting, fast paced plot make this book impossible to put down.The cast includes Hank, the flawed alcoholic whom life has beaten down, yet he still loves his parents, helps those in need, and watches out for Bud the cat. The gay Russian hitmen, Black cowboy gangsters, Detective Roman, and Bolo the Somoan. These characters all could very easily come from an Elmore Leonard book.However, it was not without its problems. The 100's of fbombs were unnecessary and detracted from the flow of the narrative, the body count required the reader to take great leaps of credibility and some of the violence was just over the top(including a cat torture scene). Yet, I still found myself turning page after page to see what would happen to Hank and Bud the cat next. Without these issues, I would have easily given this book 4 stars."
1,Caught Stealing -- Applies to the Author,"Mindless violence, implausible plotting, juvenile dialogue, one-dimensional characters made of racial and ethnic stereotypes, a four-letter vocabulary, and a main character impossible to respect or even like."
4,Auspicious Debut,"This book is quite action packed. Hank Thompson was formerly a high school baseball player in California who seemed to have a promising future until being involved in a vehicle accident. He found his way to New York and worked as a bartender on the lower east side. A neighbor who lived across the hall was in a hurry to leave town ostensibly to visit his ill father upstate. He left Hank with his cat Bud and a key for a storage locker. Of course unknown at the time to Hank the locker held $4.5 million that were ill gotten gains. Of course, other coconspirators were hot on the trial of the money. Such as a crooked cop who was highly placed, as well as Russian and Black criminals. A lot of violence ensued thru these pages as the quest continues. Reasonably good read."
5,Not for the faint of heart,"This is not the kind of book I normally read, but I picked it up based on a recommendation by Stephen King posted in the NYTimes this spring. I read it in one night. It is violent, very violent, but the evolution of Hank Thompson's character and the unexpected turns of the plot makes this book impossible to put down. And then there's the cat who clearly has more than nine lives.... In the middle of the all the mayhem and mystery I found myself wondering how is Buddy holding out -- which it turns out is one of Hank Thompson's concerns too."
5,Great Crane,This is of very good quality and detail I am very pleased with it has some good weight to it to not just a toy but actually a scale replica that functions. AAAA++++
3,Disappointing,"Despite the author's erudition and his reputation, Bloom's book is not satisfying for a reader looking to partake in a literary feast. This is more an exercise in ad libbing about each of Bloom's 100 favorites, appetizers for readers easily satisfied. Satisfactory for incidental delving but for long-term or extensive exploration: not recommended."
5,putting the human back into humanities,Professor Bloom's readings of the great authors of the Western tradition are a welcome alternative for those who need to be reminded of why they love reading literature in the first place. Bloom rightly says that we should not read to prove to ourselves what we already know or to see only what we want to see--we read in order to put ourselves into direct communication with the most original and creative minds who ever lived.
5,Provides many links between his geniuses,"Genius provides an enlightening blend of examples from over a hundred creative minds, illustrating the concept of creativity and genius and considering the elements which comprise the trait. From the Bible through modern times, the author provides many links between his geniuses and the ways they have influenced each other. A fascinating history which crosses genres to expose underlying influences."
3,Not much detailed information included,"Although numerous authors from various genres and time periods are covered within this book, the information given on each particular author is insufficient. For instance, when discussing why Jane Austen must be considered among the geniuses of literature, he only mentions one of her novels in detail in order to prove his argument. This is basically the same method he utilizes for all of the writers, although Shakespeare does receive extra attention. He only covers those writers who are deceased, yet he ignores many who, in my opinion, deserve to be credited as literary geniuses. This is because his focus is on the Western Canon."
1,BORING,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The book is a compilation of the works of 100 great literary figures, ranging from Shakespeare to Dostoevsky, with many obscure figures in between such as Hugo Von Hofmannstahl. Each chapter is devoted to one person containg brief excerpts from his or her work together with Mr. Bloom's comments purporting to show why that person is a ""genius."" Mr. Bloom's comments are random, pointless, and, in at least one case, internally contradictory. Nor does he ever clearly define the word ""genius"". Mr. Bloom's comments appear to be primarily designed to demonstrate his intimate knowledge (usually since childhood) of the literary figure's works. The purpose of the book, however, is clear, to show that no matter how big a genius these literary figures may be, the biggest genius of all is Harold Bloom."
2,Overblown style,"The concept of the ""genius"" continues to resonate in the popular imagination. Bloom is now a one-man industry, sort of the Stephen Ambrose of literature, and this book is likely to sell well. I don't find his insights into individual authors very insightful, or his Kabbalistic categories helpful. His choice of authors is also fairly predictable."
2,Subjective VIOLENCE,I bought this book because 'GENIUS' was on the cover. But that is not what the book is for. It's filled with shadowed political and religious motivation. Be careful.
1,Off Balance Griddle,"The handle on this griddle is too long, actually caused the griddle to lift off the heating element on our stove - so the heating is uneven. Argh!I've generally been pleased with Calphalon, but this design needs some tweaking."
2,Jaws,"It broke box-office records in 1975, and probably posted an aesthetic landmark, too--in proving that actors and characters were completely redundant in the shopping center cinema of the 70s. Steven Spielberg's mechanical thriller is guaranteed to make you scream on schedule, particularly if your tolerance for weak motivation and other minor inconsistencies is high. It spawned a number of imitations, most of which failed. But the formula has lived on in the Alien series and most contemporary films with aspirations toward suspense."
5,The Best Electronic Dictionary In Its Price Range,"I purchased a Sharp PW-E550 for almost $100. That is a PERFECT hand-held; and nothing else comes even close to it in terms of ease of use, features and content. In my opinion, a dictionary without headword pronunciation guide should not be called a good dictionary at all. PW-E550 would perfectly suit intermediate/advanced level American English learners/users. The only difference between PW-E350 and PW-E550 is that 350 does not have the content of Garner's Modern American Usage. [...]"
3,can bondage be blase,"This is a sort of R rated bondage video. A nice looking ""girl next door"" type has lost a bet and now must spend the weekend in bondage. That's all the plot you get. She's frequently topless, never nude she is tied up and re-tied by a sort of quiet and a little surley redneck type who is supposed to be her husband.The girl is pretty and some of the bondage poses are fun but overall the lack of passion or involvement made this video a little slow moving for me"
2,not bad for soft VERY soft porn,premise of the movie seems to be that the wife lost a bet and has to spend the weekend in bondage.unfortunately hubby doesn't seem to be very interested in any actual bondage play .. just hand cuffing and BADDLY ball gagging the wife.There is no actual porn here just the husband doing dishes and the wife walking around topless in handcuffs.but still not bad for a first date movie if you just want to give the girl ideas with out breaking out the hard stuff.
4,Fun and Playful,Several good scenes involving a variety of retraints. Playful in its approach to the subject. Perhaps a good conversation starter?
1,i did not like it,this movie was boring as can be and if your thinking about getting it think again and save your money
5,Great griddle,"Used it for the first time last night and found it works great. My first time w/non-stick cookware and found it works great with pancakes. You'll make so many, so fast that you'll have to re-organize your cooking routine. If the griddle were any bigger the first pancake would be burning before you poured the last one. As it is, 6 pancakes at a time works great -- first one is brown by the time last one is poured.Good news for smooth cooktop owners: this griddle's got a completely flat bottom so it works great, but you probably should have the ""bridge"" burner that connects the front and rear burners. I imagine (don't know for sure) that without the bridge burner you'd get a cool spot near the center of the griddle.If you're looking for a high quality, non-stick griddle that works with flat cooktops, this is the one you're looking for. It's great!"
5,Wouldn't be without it,"This pan works great on a ceramic cooktop. I never realized until I bought it that I would use it so much. Since the sides are relatively low and turn up at a sharp angle, unlike those on a regular skillet, the cooking surface is surprisingly large. I can cook up enough pancakes for five people in only two batches. We use it for grilling bacon and the high heat is no problem. Cleanup is a snap because absolutely nothing sticks to it. The handles actually do get hot, but the pan is worth every penny."
5,Great product and quick arrival,Used these for a bowl of gummy worms at our wedding reception. They looked and worked great and arrived quickly after purchase without paying for Rush Shipping.
3,Chicken tongs,These are cheap ice tongs that work fine and if that's all your looking for then these are it. I personally don't like the fact that it looks like I am using chicken feet to dispense ice. I bought other sets and only use this set with the deviled egg tray...Yes they are a perfect companion for the deviled egg tray! Too cute and a sanitary way to pick up the eggs - it's the chicken feet!
5,Easy to Read and Helpful,I liked all the examples in this book which explained the concepts. Communicating at Work was very helpful for me in my college class and I enjoyed reading it every time I opened it.
3,"Good resource, but very pricey","I had to buy this book for a class. I can't imagine to many people purchasing this book for any reason except they are required to for some class, or work-related.The book is a very good resource for speech related skills in the classroom. The content is exhaustive and very well arranged.Here's the problem. The cost. IT COST OVER $100 TO GET THIS BOOK!!!!! Are you kidding?! While this is a good book and a good reference book to have it is absolutely not worth $100.If they were going to make it cost so much they should have at least made it a hardback."
4,Communications book,Came very fast and is exactly what i needed! a bit used around the edges but it does the job it needs to do very well
1,Very Upset,"I ordered this book for a class and received it much later than I expected. The order shipment was 2 weeks later than it said it supposed to be. When I actually did receive the book, it was in pieces. The binding was not attached and it was torn up. I was very upset with the product."
3,Review,Book contents were perfect. Book cover had been ripped and taped back together. Should not have been sold as in excellent condition.
1,Horrible,"I purchased this book for a class I was taking since it was about 1/3 of the price I would have paid at the school. I knew it was used, but the description stated ""like new"". It arrived and when I opened it I was that it opened to page 19. It was missing the first chapter. I emailed cheap-n-used, the company I bought it through. I never heard back. So, I emailed Amazon.com 100% guarantee dept. I received an email the same day, however they were out of books to send. A few days later I received an email stating I was getting a 100% refund. So, with class already starting I had no choice but to purchase another book at full price from the college. I will never purchase another item from cheap-n-used through Amazon and tell everyone I know the same thing."
1,Updated Review,"After writing my review, I contacted the manufacturer, the problem with the Hollandaise sauce is that Amazon sent me some that was 5 years old. Mayacamas foods promptly replaced it and it is just great! If I could change the star rating here I would give them a 5- 4 for the product and an extra star for being a super nice company to deal with!!!I used this product a few years ago and was delighted with it, then I bought 12 packages of it from Amazon and have tried making it 4 times, and each time is a disaster. It separates and is grainy. I am very disappointed. I am not sure if I got a 'bad batch' or if Mayacamas did something to this product, but whatever the issue is- don't waste your money!"
1,Wast of money!,"The product doesn't mix well, is very grainy, like sand was mixed in it. It also has a vinegary taste to the product, and the color is to dark,and it should have a lite creamy and buttery texture to it. And yes I did use real Butter."
3,OK but with one annoying feature,Gloves are warm enough and reasonably well made but the wrist openings are too tight and restrictive making one fight to put them on and take off. I will not be buying more.
2,Spend a little more to get better quality Calphalon,"I've returned this set. The pans and non-stick parts seemed on par with Calphalon (worth the two stars), but the handles are designed horribly. There is absolutely no thought of ergonomics in this set--the handles are a not very comfortable and it's basically like a metal stick jammed into the side of a pot. I shudder to think how badly my hand would hurt picking up the larger saucepan once it was full. I realize that I could purchase handle sleeves and pot holders and such, but at this price, why should i?"
1,Terribly disappointing,"The premise is intriguing; the execution is terrible. This superficial account never reveals much about the author nor the rich context of Navajoland in which she was immersed for several years. Instead, it reads like a series of day-planner entries. Whatever idealism may have motivated her at the outset, by the end of the book her observations have morphed into cliched rationales for whatever suits her emotional or economic self-interest. Not recommended."
5,Twice as good,"One of the few films that is able to stand up to the text it is based on. A great piece of cinema that appropriatly and accurately captures the drama and lessons from the novel. And like any movie that withstands time, it keeps getting better with every viewing."
4,A hit even after all these years,"Excellent movie. I got the movie because my son had to watch it for his English class. He said the movie was just like the book, and he could follow it quite well. The characters were well drawn out. The courtroom scene was wonderful and showed the great skill of Gregory Peck as an actor. It also showed how the South used to be (and can still sometimes be.) I thought Scout was a wonderful character and how much she loved her father and her brother, Jem. She knew the difference between right and wrong but didn't understand the ""class"" that separated her family from the other families in town. Even though a wrong was done, eventually it was righted in the most extraordinary way."
4,"An absorbing, moving film - almost as good as the book!","I had loved the book of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and we were made to watch this film in English class. I found it very touching, owing to all the performances of the actors, particularly that of Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. The Tom Robinson trial was handed with sensitivity, as was the reclusive Boo Radley. The moral messages still came through as strong as the novel, and though some essential parts were left out, it still was an exceptional film that tugged at the heartstrings and left a satisfied taste in the mouth."
5,To Kill a Mockingbird DVD,Purchased as a gift and my mother loves it. Great classic - great quality and excellent delivery time.
4,A favorite movie,I teach this novel to a 10th grade class and showing the movie is an integral part of the unit. To Kill a Mockingbird is my very favorite book and the movie is one of my favorites.
3,To Kill a Mocking Bird DVD Review,"This is an excellent film with fine script, acting, and music score; however--as another reviewer has mentioned--the 1.85:1 widescreen is not enhanced for 16:9 TVs, and furthermore, the picture quality is only average. I don't recommend this version of the DVD."
2,Hard To Explain My Reason For 2 Stars,"The reason I only give this film 2 stars is that so much important material from the book was left out that I didn't even enjoy this film. The kid who played Dill annoyed me and was such a dork compared to Dill in the book. The main reason I give it 2 is because the only person I enjoyed in the whole film was Gregory Peck...well, him and Robert Duvall (who doesn't speak).IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK, DON'T WATCH THIS!"
2,Not a big deal,"This movie, is just for a lack of better word-dry.The acting from Gregory Peck is wooden, and might I add that he is the same exact thing in every movie. Scout, who is supposed to be a cute little girl comes off as a dumb brat who you just want to smack most of the time.The film moves at a seemingly pointless slow pace, and does not really delve into its topics deeply.It just brushes them off lightly.Why people find this movie deep I""ll never know.The book is also not particualrly mind blowing, but of the two, I'd take the book."
2,I regret renting this movie based on the reviews,"this is a 2.5 star movie, giving it 3 stars is already generous so I don't know why these people gave it 4-5 stars. I guess I've seen too many movies and my expectation out of a 4.5 star movie is high BUT DO NOT RENT this because other people rate it 4-5 stars, these people must watch movie once a month or something because there's no freaking way this is a 4.5 star movie"
2,Well. . .,"Personally, I think the novel was a heck of a lot better than the movie. Even the box was misleading;I was SO surprised when it turned out to be in black and white, and I HATE black and white movies. They could've done a better job with this film."
3,TKAM,"Superb acting by all the players, particulary Gregory Peck. However, no one who loves this movie should neglect the book, which has a quite different set of emphases. The courtroom drama is quite good, but disproportionately emphasized, with the result that the simple charm and poignancy of the childhood narration is lost."
5,Lost values that today's children & many adults should learn...,Atticus teaches his children values & morals that many in today's world seem to have forgotten. The children are also taught to value other's lives no matter their race or social standing in life. They are also taught to think for themselves and to learn. An entertaining piece that leaves a person with something to think about.
5,Great Classic Movie,"I am 52 years old and have never seen this movie. I am sure glad I finally watched it. It is a great movie about prejudice, good and evil, and about how people with disabilities have been treated. I highly recommend the move for those who have not seen it, and for those who have...watch it again!"
4,A Magnificent Movie now on Blu Ray,"Robert Mulligan directed this movie and kept it faithful to the book, which is always a surprise. It also shows how a wonderful book can fit on the screen like a beautifully hung picture. Gregory Peck's subdued performance underlines the character of Atticus well. Of the kids, Scout stands out. All the acting roles are beautifully done. I possessed VHS/DVD and now the Blu Ray versions. All showing improvement over the other in the home theater. Cannot expect any more enhancements.Worth watching and worth putting on your shelf."
5,Fast,I received my DVD quicker than I thought I would. It was exactly as advertised. That's what I want. Great!
2,Movie Great….product sold to me defective,"My rating reflects the product (NOT the movie). This is an amazing story. I use the video to assist teaching students who struggle to read independently. The text is very hard, so using the video to activate their thinking is a helpful strategy. When I first played the DVD (Which was brand new), I was getting ""skipping over damaged area"" messages repeatedly. I'm trying to make it work. Might have been a fluke."
5,While the novel evokes memories of my childhood...,"......the film adaptation has come down throughout my life less as a reminder of what it was like to roam through the wonders, fears, and frustrations of early youth than in Gregory Peck's magnificent depiction of what is expected of a man - as a professional, as a citizen, and as a father.It is to the model set by my own father and to the portrayal of Atticus Finch in this film that I owe much of what has been good in the fulfillment of my duty to my community, to my patients, and to the children and grandchildren who were born into my responsibility.If there is anything solid or valuable in the moral character of the male American ""Baby Boomer,"" it is attributable in at least some small way to the influence of this movie and the expectations it impressed upon us, consciously or unconsciously, in the darkened movie theaters of 1962 and 1963."
5,The Best Movie Ever!,"""A wonderful movie for all ages of a small child growing up in a world of prejudice and courage. A must see for everyone!"
5,Another Classic!,"This movie definitely makes my top ten of the greatest movies ever made.This wide screen version not only has fantastic picture quality, but also has the original trailer and a short ""making of the movie"" at the end. If you still have doubts about this movie, rent it. You won't be sorry!"
5,UNFORGETTABLE,"Gregory Peck never stood taller than in this quiet, powerful, supremely beautiful film based on Harper Lee's magnificent classic about racism, and integrity in the face of injustice. Mulligan's direction is flawless, and lovingly illuminates the Finch family, and the southern town they live in. Horton Foote's screenplay, and Elmer Berstein's expressive score capture the essence of the book marvelously. No serious film collector should be without TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.The interviews with the cast, and crew are also quite enlightening. It's fun to see the actors that played Scout, and Jem, grown up, and looking back on their roles."
1,Pirated Movie????,"Bought this DVD thinking it was a real movie. However, the supposed DVD will not play in a DVD player. It only plays on the computer. Upon further inspection the movie has a homemade sticker label. It is very evident that this movie was copied onto a CD instead of a DVD. Which leads me to believe that this was illegally copied and sold as real. I am very unhappy as I have always trusted Amazon to sell quality items."
2,Where 's the rest!,I ordered and returned this item twice. I returned it because the extra materials were missing. The second time I asked for a refund. It wasn't Amazons fault that the materials were not in the DVD since I recently found that few if any had the materials in them since the producer forgot to include them. Amazon however never mentioned that to me. Shame on them.
5,Still a Classic,The product was recieved in excellent condition and was everything I expected it to be. The movie is a classic and I never tire of watching it. The acting was superb . Child actors that are convincing in their parts are rare these days and the children in this movie were very convincing. Gregory Peck is an excellent actor who never overplays his part. I would always recommend this movie.
5,delighted,"One of my all-time favorites! Now, I have it in my personal collection. This anniversary edition has lots of extras which the true To Kill a Mockingbird fan will enjoy."
5,dvd,"I used standard shipping, and ordered this dvd during the holiday season. It still arrived before Christmas, and in perfect condition."
3,"Love the movie, but not this DVD","It was never specified that this DVD was widescreen. I hate widescreen. It also was described that the disc was in very good condition, which it was not. It was scratched and had bits of food on it! It skipped so much my boyfriend and I couldn't finish watching it! The only reason this rating doesn't get a flat out 0 is because I was refunded and was allowed to keep the useless disc, which at least saved me the trouble of having to send it back."
2,To Kill a Mockingbird,Poor picture quality. The legacy edition is much better. Pay the extra to get a better picture.
5,MOCKINGBIRD,"THIS IS A CLASSIC MOVIE A MUST IN ANYONES COLLECTION.GREAT LOCATION, AND SUPERB ACTING.SOME MOVIES SEEM TO STICK OUT AND CAN NEVER BE FORGOTTEN, THIS IS THE MOVIE OF ALL MOVIES. MAKE SOME POPCORN, LOWER THE LIGHTS SIT BACK AND ENJOY."
5,Gregory Peck at his prime!!!,"""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a classic, a masterpiece, and it is Gregory Peck at his prime. Peck, in his Oscar-winning role, is Atticus Finch, a widowed Southern lawyer, who defends Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a black man, who was accused of raping a white woman in Alabama, in the 1930s. At home, he raises his son, Jem (Philip Alford), and his daughter, Scout (Mary Badham, Oscar-nominated), and teaches them about compassion and the evils of prejudice. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is the second best movie of 1962, next to ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and one of the best and most important movies of the 1960s. If you have not seen this movie, rent it, or buy it on DVD (which is what I own on) or video, to add it to your collection. Read the book, too."
5,IT'S A CLASSIC!,"I hadn't seen this film in years, but it is still a real classic, and the performances really hold up. Gregory Peck is wonderful, but the kids, Jem and Scout are so natural and sweet it is refreshing."
4,A classic!,Gregory Peck at his best. I bought this as a gift for my college aged son (political science major). SHould be a big hit.
5,Captivated beyond Mocking,"People laugh because this is a black and white movie and story our children read about in middle school these days. What they forget about is the power of the screenplay before music hit the pictures; the emotion that ran through each performer, scene and yes through us the viewer. How you became engaged in the story to the point of being riveted on the edge of your seat for fear that you would be grabbed by the twisted neighbor...well let me tell you to leave your judgment at home and enjoy a stellar performance by Gregory Peck in one of the century's greatest classics!"
3,Nice disc but no cover,"The listing photo for this item is the cover while the item arrived in a blank, generic cover. Disc is fine but I would have purchased from a different seller with a cover had I known."
4,To Kill a Mockingbird 50th Anniversary Edition,"The DVD comes with Digital Copy and a free gift. I was disapointed because I was not allowed to download the digital copy as I resides in Malaysia. As for the free gift, I was not entitle to it as I am residing in Malaysia. Why is it so?"
3,A Classic But Boring,"I love classics, Black and White Films and even slow paced Hitchcock films. I agree they dont make films like they used to. I agree the golden era of cinema has long since passed.This film, and i can see how it is considered a classic, is descent but boring. Especially now in 2004.WIth all the great reviews (due mainly because its a classic) will have you thinking this must be an amazing black and white film!Well if you expect that, especially with todays fast paced films where the camera cant stand still for seconds on a character, you will find this film unbelievably boring.Give me Hitchcock, James Dean, Marlon Brando's black and white films, Bogart, James StewartBUt this film will bore uand the kids-- u will want to kill them"
1,Universal is the worst,"The single star is for Universal and NOT this brilliant film. The 'To Kill a Mockingbird' blu ray has been up for pre-order since January. That is deplorable. Universal continually does a bad job with their great classic catalogue. From the Hitchcocks to the Monster movies of the 30s and 40s will be neglected because Universal doesn't believe in upgrading these treasures to blu ray. They don't think old movies will make them money. Shame on them. Amazon, you should pull this from pre-order. It will never happen."
5,"Outstanding film, outstanding transfer",Universal is definitely getting its act together with film restoration. To Kill A Mockingbird looks like it was shot yesterday. I'm mystified that some person dissed the visual quality of this blu-ray. Guess you can't please some people even if you do a fantastic job... like with this title! Not much need to discuss the film. It's a classic. What can you say? Peck's greatest role. A story that still resonates after all these years.
5,Excellent DVD and appropriate additional features,"This DVD provides clear images and speech. In addition to the complete motion picture, there are a question and answer session by Gregory Peck (Atticus Finch), an interview with the adult Mary Badham (Scout Finch), and other offerings."
5,Great,"It's a classic, what else is there to say.We are happy with the product, the condition it arrived in and the ordering process."
5,Better than ever,One of the best films of all time. Gregory Peck is perfect in the role as is the entire cast. The subject is as relevant to today as when the film was made. The print is like you are seeing it in the theater.
5,A must see...,"Some great things that happened in the book are left out, but this is still a great movie. Peck is amazing as Atticus; just as I pictured him to be. Scout and Jem are pretty good, too. A classic!"
4,Great DVD,"This is my wife's favorite movie and novel. We had the VHS tape but wanted to upgrade to the DVD. Great movie. Gregory Peck captures the main character, Atticus Finch, to perfection. The Academy Award was richly deserved. Harper Lee was able to capture the mood of the time in this novel. Great family entertainment. A must see!!"
3,To Kill a Mockingbird,"I was taken back by how slow moving this movie was. I believe due to how old this is that we have little tolerance for something that plods along like this did. In its time it was obviously cutting edge due to the content. I found the children very annoying during most of the first half of the movie. The only parts that I truly enjoyed were when it got to the trial and from then on to the end. I can see why Gregory Peck won an award but the movie as a whole was very, very slow."
1,Viewing,Took forever to download then it would not play on my ipad. :( Threw away $3.00. Too bad...it's a good movie.
2,The book is ALWAYS better than the movie,"Actually, I was rather disappointed by this movie. I read the book before watching the movie, and I thought it was much, much better. The movie left out several principal characters or made them have very minor roles, such as Miss Maudie, Mrs. Dubose, and Aunt Alexandra. It also cut the story up and mixed it around, leaving out important events and making it less meaningful than the book. All in all, I would highly recommend the book To Kill A Mockingbird over the movie. I am an eighth grader who was required to read the book for class; I dreaded it at first because I hate reading long classic books, but I thought the story was wonderfully written. This movie just confirms my idea that the book is always better than the movie."
3,Dated but thoroughly watchable,"Though the film today seems somewhat dated and oversimplified in its views of racism, many powerful moments still shine through and Badham is very charming as Scout, who's point of view the story is told from. One particularly beautiful scene that I remember is the film's finale which involves her and Robert Duvall finally meeting in a personal, heartfelt way. Gregory Peck isn't terrific (and how did Peter O'Toole lose the Oscar to him?!) but fairly good."
4,Great! But Disc 2 a bit dull.,"Great packaging, deluxe and sturdy.Extras ranging from pretty good to excellent on Disc 1. The reason for 4 star-rating and not 5 is that Disc 2 is a bit of a snooze, though not entirely. Too much of Disc 2's content seems to show Peck so much later on in his life, it would have been better to include more vintage footage from the era, circa 1962,if any such footage is available (Johnny Carson, or Jack Paar or whoever hosted such shows in the day). It just would have been nice to see more of Peck's career at the time, or any Premiere footage, Golden Globes, whatever. Love the 11 international mini-poster reproductions."
5,One of the best movies of all time.,"Often it is said that ""the book was much better than the movie."" While I would still not substitute the movie for the book, the movie was ultimately able to capture the essence of the book. An incredible movie in all the ways that make a movie good."
5,An American Classic,"Certain films define not only their particular genre, but also their country. For me, as a Canadian, this film has always embodied the best and worst of what exemplifies southern American culture. It deals with children, with racial issues, with the persistent matter of ""differentness"" that lies at the heart of every person's most significant issues. To be ""different"" is to be isolated; it's an issue that embraces personality, ethnicity, skin color, economic level--everything, really. And this film deals with that matter on several levels. It is, to my mind Gregory Peck's more memorable performance, embodying as he does the ideals by which we can only try to live. And it was Robert Duvall's debut film performance as the spooky, seldom-seen, but everpresent Boo Radley. This is, in the truest sense, an American classic: affecting, powerful, and wonderfully faithful to the book."
5,Excellent!,"We read TO Kill a Mockingbird in our English class, and I loved it. I would read the book a couple more times to get even more out of it. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very very good. Gregory Peck is PERFECT as Atticus. As well as Scout and Jem being played by the perfect people. The film is extremely moving, and provides even more want to read the book and get into the whole story. Some of my favorite scenes include the trial, Scout's talks with Atticus, and of course Radley's appearance. The setting of the Novel is perfectly portrayed, and lets us understand the book even better. Even if you didn't like the book, I encourage that you watch the movie becuase it was excellent!!"
4,"No Better Than The Book, But Worthy of A Classic","I read this book in 6th grade (outside of school) and was blown away by it. I expected the movie to be horrible, but it's the best ""book-movie"" I've ever seen. It is definitely worth buying, but you have to read the book first. The book will illuminate your mind with great masculine and feminine representivity and just change your life."
5,One of the BEST DRAMA movies ever!,I waited for ever for To Kill A Mocking Bird to come out on Blu Ray. But it was worth the wait. Great Movie!
5,A Tenderly Moving Film Experience!,"The new Collector's Edition dvd for Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is truly fantastic, filled with many extras like a captivating behind-the-scene documentary that is about an hour and a half long with fascinating interviews with the wondrous actors who brought the characters to life such as the Mary Badham(Scout),Phillip Alford(Jem), Brock Peters(Tom), Collin Wicox(Mayella), and many more. The audio commentary is also particularly interesting which allows a more in-depth look at this film adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.After watching the dvd, I just had to grab my copy of Lee's great book and reread it over again. The film is one of those rare gems which is able to capture the true beauty and essence that the novel exudes. Please watch this inspirational film and read the novel which brought this film to life. Thanks."
5,"Once a classic, always a classic","This is my favorite movie of all time. I highly recommend it. Watched it with my 14-year old son and he loved it, too."
5,To Kill a Mockingbird,"What can I say...a great book and movie!! I read this in high school and then saw the movie. Usually the movies aren't as good as the book, but this one turned out great!!!"
5,excellent,Heart warming story. This is the story of a person who makes decision based soley on his moral compass. World would be better place if all of us lead life that way. A person of majority race stands with minority voice and tries to protect a person of minority race. It is easy to profess but difficult to practice.
5,Thank You!,I needed this DVD. To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite movie but I only had it on VHS. It sat on my wish list for a few months before I purchased it. It is such a wonderful story and I'm glad to be able to add it to my collection.
1,Live at the Budokan,This appears to be Live at the Budokan taken from the 1974 appearance on Japanese TV. The 1972 Karen looked much different than she appears on this rehashing of a previous released DVD. It's not worth the money if you already have the Budokan DVD.
3,Nice Rip-Off of Liva at Budokan-Japan,"I tend to but almost anything ""Carpenters"" related so I sometimes get things that aren't so great. This is one of those things. It is just a rip-off from the Budokan concerts in Japan. I would say this: SAVE YOUR MONEY !! There is a wonderful-actually authorized DVD from the Budokan-Japan concerts which is totally superior to this offering. Budokan is very cool because it shows the Tokyo arrival of the Carpenters, et all. We even get to see the 747 landing in Tokyo.Lots of home movies from Dad Carpenter were also used in that production. It is also a much better ""concert experience"" because it is pretty much start to finish.This DVD just starts right off--with no intro on Rainy Days & Mondays.The quality is very-very good--sound is very good too. Its just an edited way down version of Budokan. But---if you like to own everything ""Carpenters"" you probably won't be disappointed--especially if you never got an actual-authorizedBudokan DVD."
4,Carpenters - In Performance 1972,"Carpenters - In Performance 1972, great look back at the past of Karen and Richard in concert, great songs as ever. Video quality not up to today's standards but still well worth watching and enjoyable."
4,Karen Carpenter,"The only reason why I don't give this DVD 5 stars is simply because the video quality isn't that good. I don't know if this video was originally made from a bootleg or not, but regardless of whether this came from a bootleg or not,just hearing and seeing Karen Carpenter makes this DVD worthwhile. Listening to her Sing the song ""Sing"" in japanese is absolutely tremendous. I'm surprised that Richard Carpenter has not released a more quality version of the Carpenters live in concert. Releasing the Carpenters TV Specials would also be welcomed."
2,Major Dissapointment,"I should have paid attention to the other reviewers but I just wanted to see and hear Karen. The Japanese sub-titling and closed captioning is very distracting. It can't be turned off and would be distracting even if it were in English. The quality of the video taping is extremely poor. The lighting is insufficient, the images are grainy/fuzzy and there is often distortion in the audio. It looks like a 5th or 6th generation copy from the original. Having said all that, I still must add that it was good to see and hear Karen in spite of the poor quality. She was gone far too soon!"
5,A great read and a great gift!,"I bought this book for my husband as a surprise gift for football season. Not only did he love it, but he insisted that I read it. I was not disappointed. It is packed full of information, has a great index and is written with humor and an edge. This is a talented writer that I hope plans to write more. I highly recommend this book."
3,like the return from El Lay,"This book is great when the author just talks about the Raiders and the history but the game to game details I basically skimmed over. After you read one game analysis (not that they are bad or anything) you have kind of read them all.Being a Raiders fan it's not that I didn't enjoy the book but it's like this whole Gannon (who I think is just a KC Chief plant designed to destroy the Raiders from within) and Rice (aargh, an annoying 49er in Raider colors, something is not right there) era--it just falls short of being truly great."
3,Amusing but in serious need of editing,"This book had its amusing moments, bringing back both childhood and recent memories. Unfortunately, the book was in serious need of editing. Missing periods, typos, and constantly-changing names were a problem throughout the book. Perhaps this publisher doesn't want to spend on having someone carefully read over the manuscripts before publishing them, which is a shame because it detracts from the book's merits."
2,"Formulaic, but it's got hot air balloons","Ok, ok--I rented this video on the strength of its having a hot air balloon on the cover, and figured it'd be ""fluff"" to watch on an evening we wanted to curl up with someting light, ""easy watching"" for my balloon-pilot wife.This is your basic pair-'em-off formula, with just enough angst to keep things moving, and everyone happy in the end. It does have some very nice balloon shots, including some technical mistakes...which only a pilot will notice. The locale is Temecula, CA, which is an active center of balloon flight. Prepare to watch every stereotype of California flakiness you have ever heard of.Looking for an evening of light entertainment? This will fill the bill."
1,"Temecula is pretty, movie is awful","We live in temecula, so I was curious, Oy veh, this is a really bad movie. Even my dad who is a Howie Mandel fan was horrified by this. You'd think it was made in the 80's, so it would have an excuse...but it is fairly recent!"
1,Powderkeg/ No where to hide,"Potential buyers of this title, beware, the quality is terrible. I have an old vhs copy of this film which blows away this dvd. I think somebody pinned up a white sheet projected a faded, scratched, spliced, 8mm film on to it, and then filmed it with a 1980's era video camera. It is a shame that there are those who will try to sell such decrepid transfers to film buffs trying to get a good copy of films they enjoy. For now I will just hang on to my old vhs, hopefully someone will bring this title out in a respectable transfer."
2,Read this first before deciding if your child should hear it,"I have many Mercer Mayer books and this one came in a collection. I started reading it to my daughter and could not beleive it and how it was written. I though it was going to express who to handle yourself with dignity - not to get encouraged by a little sister who tells you to punch em!! Now my daughter is 4yrs old and doesn't have a bully issue but even if I did have a child that was a bully or being bullied, I don't think I would offer this book. With that said, I do believe this world is now becoming too ""politically correct"" and some of the negative reviews here are a little much. I would not want to have my daughter/son in a situation as this and hope they go to an adult but if they are backed into a corner, by all means they should punch back. I think kids need to learn how to handle themselves but I do no think this book portrayed what could possibly happen and isn't a good read."
1,Horrible - Horrible,"This book was given to me as a gift. I am an Elementary School Counselor. When I read the book I wanted to throw up. It ends with the little boy who has been bullied beating up the bully. When he gets on the bus everyone cheers and his sister beats up the bully. The book ends with him talking about his sister being tough and how the bully should not bother him again. So, I guess the author thinks that violence is the best way for kids to stop bullying. How inappropriate, how sad and what a waste of money. This book will never be used as a teaching tool."
1,I cannot believe this book was written by Mercer Mayer!,"I strongly disapprove of the message this book is sending out! In it, the Little Critter is being bothered by a bully. He tells his teacher, and the bullying gets worse. He decides to fight the bully instead. It does not offer any other solutions to the problem of bullies. I will not read this book to my sons again."
1,PASS ON THIS ONE!,"Actually would give no stars if that were an option. This storywas so poorly written to address the issue of bullies. In the story,the ""critter"" being bullied goes to an adult for help and the situation gets worse until things escalate into a fist-fight! Can't believe this is a ""new"" book. Reads like something that might have been done in the 50's. Parents should think twice before having children read this story. I'm glad I read the book alone first! My daughter never saw it - it was that bad! Not the kind of ""help"" kids need for this issue. In fact, the story offered no usable solutions to a bully situation."
5,Very pleased with product and service.,"Beautiful workmanship. I needed quick shippping on this item as it was to be a birthday gift. Arrived promptly, good packaging. Will definitely use this vendor again."
5,Awesome,It was really pretty. I received it very fast. It was packaged very clever so to not have broken parts.
5,Beautiful and sturdy,"I can only echo what everybody else says: the sculpture is beautiful!And it is sturdy, so I expect this to adorn our front yard for a long time."
5,An unexpected winner,"I don't know why, but this book is captivating to both my kids - my (almost) three year old girl liked it from about 6 months (and still does) and its all over if my 18 month old boy sees it: 3-4 read throughs minimum. The illustrations are bright and clear and yet there is enough detail (and, if you can imagine it, suspense!) to keep my older toddler interested."
5,"Great sprayer, would buy again",I've been looking for a small sprayer for a while to use for things like grill flare ups and for small amounts of homemade cleaners. This is just what I've been looking for. The only thing that was kinda bad was the cost of shipping.
4,Great supplier and pretty good spray bottle,"I've used multiple spray bottles for water only. This bottle's spray apparatus doesn't seem to catch the water reliably if you don't have the nozzle set just right - but if you do have it set just right, it does what it's supposed to do!"
3,Strange length,"I have normal height doors and even on the shortest setting my 6 month old is squatting to low and can't really get a bounce going. Maybe it's just that I have a big boy. He is 19.25 lbs and is 27 inches long. So, I recommend if you have a child similar to my child's height/weight and don't have a place other than a door to hang it from, you get a stand alone bouncer. That's what I'm gonna try next."
4,Good bouncy times,"The baby loves this thing! Lots of hopping and screaming. It is super easy to ""install"" since you just pull the top open far enough to get past the door facing. No tools needed. The only problem I have is that the front strap on the right is slightly longer thus making the baby crooked! I cannot adjust it either. There is no mention of this in the instructions and I saw another left leaning baby (in a yellow tee)in a pic someone submitted with their review. It's odd that the straps that hold the tray aren't adjustable which is why I had to deduct a star. I am going to try and rig it up so the baby's legs don't grow funny!"
4,Good product but...,"Good product. It's safe which is most important. However, my baby got bored after a few minutes, but that could be just my baby. It was a little hard to adjust as we needed it to go higher than the normal strap allows. The bumpers avoid slaming into door frame or hurting his little fingers. I wish it had more entertaining gadgets."
5,If you think it's too low read this for instructions!,"I thought we had the jumper to the highest and we were a little disappointed because it was a little too low to the ground. My son (4.5 months) still loved it, but I figured it would only last about a month or two. Well, I finally figured out how to make it higher! After you slide the plastic piece to the bottom you take the piece of material that is sewn together and you loop it through and pull it out (the loop will stick out). If you have any questions about how to do it, please comment. It was a little confusing on page 10 of the manual.Pros: My baby loves this jumper! He could easily jump in it for an hour or more if I let him! It was easy to put together and seems to be pretty sturdy.Cons: It took some time to figure out how to adjust it to the right size."
5,Fantastic Fun!!!!,"We got this jumper for our 4 month old girl and she LOVES it!!! She is now 5 months and will happily spend 30 minutes to an hour in it, 3 or 4 times a day. She jumps, she spins, and just hangs out. We considered a walker but since we don't have the space, this is perfect. It is awesome for helping her strengthen her legs. The biggest pros are the tray, toy attachments, bumper and sturdiness. I would highly recommend this product."
4,good,"hello, good morning this product is very good, recomendhello, good morning this product is very good, recomendhello, good morning this product is very good, recomend"
2,The adjustment mechanism doesn't hold its place,"The title sorta says it all.Everything else about this seat I really really enjoy! But the slip/loop mechanism that allows you to adjust for the height of the door and your baby's size doesn't hold... Sorta a big deal. I've had to get two large, strong clips to hold pressure on the loop-within-a-loop way the manufacture tells you to make an adjustment to stop it from slipping. I have followed the instructions to a T and in my opinion a big flaw that this doesn't do its job so thus the (2) star rating.But other than that issue and the fact it can be rectified by ""rig'n"" its not horrible."
4,baby loves it,"We received the jumper very promptly after placing our order. It was very easy to assemble and within minutes it was ready to go. We put our 6 month old daughter in it for the first time and it didn't take long for her to start bouncing and giggling. Now it's her favorite pass time. We tried several other ""gadgets"" before discovering the jumper. Now we can accomplish simple things like cooking dinner or washing dishes and our daughter stays happy because she feels like she's a part of what's going on. She can sit up, turn around in it to follow us and when she gets excited, bounce. Great product!"
5,Graco bumper jumper,"I used a johnny jump up for my kids. When my grands came along wanted the convenience & the portability of this again. I mainly hung it from a branch of the magnolia tree so he could enjoy the outdoors while exercising. Used it in the house in nearly every doorway. He munched food from it and played/bounced while I read to him; while we watched TV; to keep him restrained while I washed dishes/did chores, etc. I LOVE these contraptions and so do the kids! That is not to say that it didn't take him about 3 days to warm up to it, but once he got the hang of the bouncy & the spinning around, he had the time of his life!"
2,Pick another Jumper,"I find the seat of the jumper to be too large. My son siting in it hanging to one side. He is a large baby too.Also, once adjusted properly for height the strap needs readjustment at each use.It is easy to put on the door frame and my son enjoys the stuffies it came with. This was a better solution for our home than the exersaucer size jumpers.Also, my son was able to scrape off the GRACO logo and had blue all under his nails and probably consumed some. I contacted GRACO and they reported the paint is non-toxic."
4,6mo old son loves it!,Purchased this as our 6 month old son was getting comfortable with sitting up and needed something new to keep himself entertained. He really enjoyed his activity center so we decided to give this bouncer a try. Our little man loves bouncing in this and it's easy to move around the house. I would recommend this product to anyone with a baby who enjoys bouncing.
3,Nice idea but our baby was easily bored by it,"I did not get much use out of this product. The first day, our baby enjoyed it, but after that, she failed to really jump around. The instructions state that their feet must be partially touching the floor, but in this position, she would only spin around.I like that it was easy to set up above our doorway, and it seems safe. It's also easy to keep clean, and she liked the little toys that came with it. I would probably get a door swing if I had to do it again."
5,Loooove it!,"My baby sister has always been a big kicker, even before she was born. She's always so full of energy, and this bouncer really helps her to release it all in a productive way, all the while strengthening her little legs.She just turned 5 months and she fits in here perfectly! She absolutely enjoys bouncing in it, and gets so giddy when she knows it's time for her daily ""bouncy"". I can't put into words how much this helps to keep her entertained when things need to be done elsewhere around the house, and it's comforting to know that she's as safe as can be when in it. There is no way for her to injure herself, so we can leave her alone for a few minutes and she's just fine.This is sturdily built and the toys help a lot in keeping her busy, too. Nothing bad about this! Would highly recommend to any parent."
4,Nice Jumper,"It is easy to install/move around. Seems stable and secure and our daughter is large. She hasn't figured out the jumping part yet and may outweigh it before she does. That is the only down side for us, the weight limit. Our daughter really likes the toys with it."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!,"Its easy and great! My son is 4 months and he can't get enough of it!! You can just put him in there and its save and I get so much done while he is jumping his heart away! Perfect price, very much worth every penny!"
4,Good for right now,"We bought this to keep our daughter occupied once she got more active but could not yet walk, crawl or sit on her own. Laying on her gymini was not cutting it anymore. So far, it has worked out well. She likes jumping in it and it keeps her safe. The door clamp is very easy to use and I can take it on and off whenever I like. She has a tendency to lean forward in it and you must watch out for diaper changes (must act quick or the way the seat pushes on them could lead to bad news). It's a little difficult to get them in and out (out is harder) but you get better at it with practice. Overall, I like this product for this moment in time. I imagine she will outgrow it soon, but for the price it's a great item to have for these 2-3 months and we can always share it with friends."
4,Really fun for baby but adjusting for height is limited,"I have a big baby (he is tall and heavy) for his age. We started using this when he was four months; because he still could not control his head well, it was limited. Well, he is 6 months now and 29 inches long and almost 20 pounds, and now that he can control himself better, he is almost too tall for it. The picture in the instructions show that the baby should be on the pads of his feet, not flat footed. He is almost standing in it and we have it adjusted all the way up. My only complaint would be that Graco should have allowed for more room to adjust it shorter for taller babies. Otherwise, my stinker loves this jumper! It's the only way daddy and I get a break. : )"
3,Just O.K.,"This serves it's purpose. It is well made, but I find the tray bulky and unneccesary. It's also ugly (in my opinion) and is bulky to store."
5,Awesome Jumper!,My son is only 3 months old and we bought this jumper for him b/c he always wants to stand up. He absolutely loves it. He's not sure what to do yet b/c he is so young but has a great time trying to bounce and spinning around. We have a somewhat open floorplan in our home so wer put the jumper in the doorway b/w the kitchen and dining room. the doorway is relatively small but the jumper fits great. it is easy to take up and down. The toys that come with it only velcro on but i used toy links to attach his favorite ones.
5,New Moms Don't Miss This One,"Purchased this jumper for our granddaughter as a Christmas gift last month. She was 6 months old then and loved it almost immediately. She jumps, swings, sways, twirls around while laughing and gets lots of wonderful exercise. Very sturdy and holds secure above the door frame. It is adjustable, just had to do a little research to understand how to make it shorter. The velcro does not hold the little toys on very well, but our granddaughter is having such a great time jumping that she really doesn't need them. Transports easily so it comes to Grandma's when I babysit. I can't believe more new Moms don't know about this wonderful item. We used something similar for our children in the 70s. This is a must!"
3,didnt fit my doors !!,"unfortunately i just received this jumper and it doesn't fit my my door, there is no mentioning of the maximim door thickness !! for all of you who are considering this jumper : its well built & looks good but doesn't fit just any door , in the manual they say that the door thickness should bemaximum 16.5 CM. i wish they shared this before i bought it :("
3,Not a good fit for old houses,"We were very excited about ordering this product and even had it sent overnight so we could try it out. Unfortunately, the clamp that secures the jumper to the door frame does not accommodate the moldings in older houses. Our house was built in 1918 so the mouldings are pretty substantial but not crazy large and the clamp will not fit over the moulding..it misses by 2 inches so, we'll be returning this product."
5,Great product,"This is a great product, I would definitely recommend this to others. Our eight month old loves spending time in the jumper."
1,Fun then Dangerous,"We bought this product and loved it for months. I thought it was great, easy to set up and move, and my daughter loved it. Then one morning I put my 8 mo old in it so I could make a bottle. As I was standing at the sink filling the bottle I heard my daughter hit the floor. She had managed to tip herself over the side. She hit her forehead on the floor. Thankfully, I think her legs got tangled in the straps and slowed her fall. She is alright but I put the jumper away for good. The jumper was correctly adjusted for her height and she had her legs through the holes. Until this incident I would have highly recommended this jumper. Now I would advised not to buy."
2,Too tall for doorway,"Our doorway is 82 inches tall and at its shortest setting this jumper hangs to the floor. Our baby is just barely big enough for it and it's already too long. There is no way to adjust it any shorter, but it can be extended about 18 inches longer. Who has doorways this tall?"
3,Disappointed in adjustability.,"I purchased this for my 5 month old. And while it is well made, nice looking, and fun (hence the 3 stars) the hang strap is not very adjustable. From the beginning we had it as short as it would go and if my child grows any more, her legs will not be positioned correctly to use the jumper. Our doorways are not particularly low (I think we have 7' doorways). My child loves this toy, and I'm kind of disappointed that she won't be able to use it for very long."
3,nice jumper but strap too long,"The jumper itself is wonderful. However, when I put my 6 month old son in the jumper I could immediately tell the strap it hangs from is too long. We hung it from a traditional height doorway, and my son maximized the height of the jumper. Within a month i had to tie a knot in the strap to make it shorter so my son could continue jumping. Otherwise, he was jumping from his knees! Overall it's a great jumper, and he absolutely loves it. I just wish there was a height adjustment on the strap."
1,kindof dangerous,"We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it! With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand."
4,An absolute hit!!!,I purchased this for my first son & he had hours of fun!! I have never seen a child laugh & enjoy something do much! Hours of fun & enjoyment all while getting exercise!!!!
4,"Good bounce, nice tray, may not be for heavier babies","Pros: I like the tray around the bouncer, the neutral colors, the toys attached to the bouncer, and the ability to rotate the direction the bouncer is facing without having to take it off the door frame.Cons: The diagrams in the instructions show how the baby's feet should rest on the floor. My little one is heavy for her size, but not close to the max weight for the jumper and her feet will soon be flat on the floor. I've adjusted it all the way and it can't be raised any further. I don't think it's terrible, just not ideal.I do think I would buy this again. Great value for the price."
4,Fun for hours,Our daughter absolutely loves this jumper. She is pretty tall for her age and it cannot be raised much higher so we are a little worried that she will not get long-term use out the jumper. Product is safe and sturday and built well. No complaints and would highly recommend to others.
5,Spectacular baby jumper,"The baby jumper encourages baby to keep Standing, jogging and develop the march. entertain the baby with toys attached to the support, which can suit the range of hands, and the coffee table that allows manipulation and exploration of objects offered to the baby. The baby jumper aesthetically very pleasing and we are happy to let the baby have fun or a few minutes."
3,such a nice jumper,"Overall I was satisfied with this product. However, they are not the Johnny Jumper's of your parent's generation. I am sure this is a safety precaution, but bouncing in this thing leaves a little more to be desired. It's a little awkward. Definitely for bigger babies. I had just been told & expected it to be easier for babies to bounce around in."
3,Not for young babies,"I bought this jumper when my son was 5 months old. It was hate at first try for him! Since the seat is so big, nothing was keeping him from falling on one side or the other. I put a small rolled towel around him, but it didn't help much, there was too much space and nothing really holding him. I kept trying every few weeks to put him in it, but he just didn't like it.He's now 9 months, and I thought I'd give the thing a last try before I get rid of it. This time he liked it, jumped and laughed and stayed in it for a good 20 minutes. What a difference! I guess now that he holds himself properly and is bigger (20 pounds), it's much more enjoyable.So I'd say it's not for young and small babies, unless your baby has a very good balance. Had I known, I would have gotten a more traditional jumper to get more use out of it."
4,Fun for baby,Bought this for one of the twin granddaughters. They absolutely LOVE it! Just be sure it is secured in the doorway because the baby gets to jumping and you want to be sure it doesn't fall off.
3,Too long for average door frame,"The bumper jumper is wonderfully made, I especially like the soft ""bumpers."" The bad ... we have made the jumper as short as we can and it's still too long for an average size door frame. Come on Graco, you can do better than that!!!"
4,A good jumper,I've had this jumper for 5 months - my son is a serious jumper (& he recently broke his exersaucer - he's well beyond the size/weight recommendations we knew it was only a matter of time). It doesn't accommodate the lower door frames too well...but it's much better than the evenflow jump & go. It handles his size/weight much better & saves my doors from a serious beating.
2,too short,My son is in the 90% for height and grew out of this before he could even learn to crawl. There should be an easier way to shorten the length of the strap other than adjusting the short little loop.
2,Too easy to smash little hands,Too easy for baby to smash hands between door jam and tray. Returned it after one try. Baby caught on to the jumping right away and was not afraid.
5,Great jumper!,Keeps him upright and prevents banging into the doorway. My son is 5 months and he has done really well with standing in this.
3,Baby Jumper Exerciser,"My 7 month old grandson loves his new bouncer and sqeals with delight while bouncing away. It is well made and the bumper protects his little arms and head from possibly bumpng up against the door frame. I have one complaint, however, and that is that the height adjustment does not hold very well and is not user friendly. It gradually slips and has to be readjusted sometimes during use and certainly after each use."
3,"Great Design, but not great for big babies","This unit is very sturdy and well-made. I like the bumper tray as it protects my door frames and prevents my son from hitting his head. My son loves jumping and swaying in the bumper jumper, but the only problem is that the height adjuster strap is too long and my son who is only 4 and a half months old is almost too tall for it. My little guy is very big for his age, but the jumper is only at the right position at the highest setting, and I just got it a few weeks ago! I guess I hoped to get more use out of it, but for now it is a great product and would be highly recommended for small to average size babies."
3,"Great for entertainng baby, slight flaws in constuction","This product is a life saver, keeping the baby entertained for up to a half and hour at time. However, I found that one of the three straps that suspend the seat is longer than the other two, making the seat lean to one side. I placed a rolled up towel in between the strap and the plastic armature to adjust the height so my baby is always jumping on his left leg. The swivel isn't as smooth as it should be, but other than that, it seems to be working great."
3,lots of fun but a pain to adjust to height,"Baby loves this jumper and we love to watch her play - she's fit in it since 3-4 months (big baby). What I find most frustrating is how LONG the cord is - it's as if it's made to fit a door 30 feet high. We use it on our standard doorway (approx 7 ft); if we tighten the adjuster to the shortest it can get, it is still way too long for baby (baby basically should be on tippy toes). The only option is to pull the cord through under again; this works, but only temporarily... once baby gets going, the cord will pull out of this and baby will be almost bouncing on her knees. I have to constantly supervise baby to make sure it doesn't pull out and to re-thread it through. It's a pain, and it's hard to readjust it with baby in the seat."
5,Baby LOVES IT!,My three (almost four) month old absolutely loves this jumper. The tray is nice to set her toys on and she also likes to hang onto it when she starts jumping. Very entertaining for the LO and she is able to move around and not have to be held or on her back all the time. Very easy to set up and take down and to adjust the height.
3,"all good, except....","We bought this to replace the Sassy bouncer which was a disaster. Our son likes this one much better, the tray is great and the three-point jumper keeps him stable. The only thing is that it's way to long for our doorway. Even at it's shortest, it is a bit too long. I read about this in other reviews, and it's true. We have an exposed beam and will retrofit it with some wood and attach the jumper to that, so it will work. Our doors are totally normal sized, too. A bit of a disappointment"
1,graco jumper broken cable,"when baby first jumped, one of the 3 cables broke, was not useful. I returned it"
2,Too boring,"I guess every kid is different. I bought this due to the rave reviews. I thought my daughter didn't know she was supposed to jump in it. Eventually I realized it was just too boring and the toys were boring as well. A friend gave us a used FP Ocean Wonders Jumperoo. She LOVED it! She jumped in that and it was great because the reward for jumping is certain sounds, music, and lights. This item is another to add on the list of baby things that just gathered dust."
3,Graco Bumper Jumper,"This was given as a gift so I can't give a fair review (thus 3 stars because I had to rate to send) of how well it works or how easy it is to set up. However, the product arrived on time as described."
3,Adjustable height strap is too long,"The strap was too long, so we had to shorten it with a zip tie just above he adjustment piece. If the zip tie breaks, no big deal, the baby falls a few inches. We didn't cut the strap just zip tied a loop in it to take up slack."
4,Simply Great!,My niece went just crazy by the time we stood her at the jumper.Seeing that big smile on her face made me think that this is too much fun for a real small price!
4,My grandson loves it,My grandson enjoys playing in Bumper Jumper. The spring loaded clamp that holds the Bumper Jumper above the door casing has not made any visable marks or damage on the walls. One thing to note is you need to have strong and secure moulding above the door to safely use this. The only issue we have encountered is that it can be a little difficult to get him in and out of the jumper without getting tangled in the straps. With a little pre-thought this can easily be avoided.
4,babys love this,"I have had this jumper through the years and each one of my children loved it although making the jumper higher as they grow and get heavier was never a challenge until this particular model but after reading instructions and not giving up i finally figured out how to make it higher, There are 2 different ways to make it higher so dont give up if you are having trouble. My grandson loves it. Also as they get bigger and really learn how to jump its best to have them in a doorway that is bigger than a standard doorway and if one of your larger doorway does not have molding but has a support beam just add two blocks of wood on either side of the beam and hook the jumper to the wood, it works perfectly ."
2,Too long for standard door frames!,"My three month old absolutely loves this jumper. I purchased the hugga bebe for him to be able to fit and it works great. Definately recommended.UPDATE::I purchased this about 4 months ago for my three month old and it WAS great for a while. When he was actually big enough to fit in the thing properly, there was no more strap to take up and he practically sits on the floor. I wish it was designed for standard door frames so he could actually use it. Too bad."
2,Measure your doorways....,I live in a 100 year old house and this just did not work for us. The only doorway this fit was the added on laurdry room... clearly that is not ideal. Had to return :(
5,"In all his four months of life, this is the best gift he has gotten.",I enjoy this gift as much as my Grandson. He wants to view the world upright and on the move and this jumper lets him do just that. None of those reclining seats were ever the right fit with him and Graco Bumper Jumper has filled the bill.
5,easy to assemble,this jumper was easy to assemble. We bought it to have on hand when the grandbabiesvisit. We found that it fits nicely in the doorway. I also noticed that the clothpart is easy to remove and clean. We have used it a few times and it has a nice bounce to it. It is also easy to store when not in use.
3,It worked as it should but there are more useful bouncers out there..,"I bought this because I remembered that we had them growing up and loved them. This one works just fine, but after seeing how much he loves the other bouncers (not the ones that hang from the door) we wished we could throw this one away (we just hate to waste the $$) so it'll probably go to Grandma's house."
5,Grandson loves it!,"This jumper seat works great. Very sturdy, and lots of bounce for our little one. The tray is a bonus as you can put toys on it. Would definitely recommend."
4,Jumper,This is a great product. installs easily and doesn't take up as much room as the other jumpers that sit on the floor...Nick
5,every baby should have this!!!!,"It came quickly and was perfect. I had one 12 years ago with my second child and it has been passed around the family for that long. (Someone is still using it!) I needed a new one for my nephew. It does exactly what it should do. It bounces, is safe and develops strong leg muscles! We love it!"
4,Graco Bumper Jumper,"Great, but make sure you have an upper door frame ledge on both sides to hang the jumper."
3,"Great jumper, but not for babies on the small side","This jumper has great, sturdy construction, is super easy to move around and I like the tray. I hate to give it 3 stars, but it doesn't seem to be a good fit for babies on the smaller side. My 6 month old daughter is a bit of a peanut (her whole body could fit through one of the leg holes, which are pretty big) and she seems to be a bit terrified when I put her in there as she flops around and seems to be drowning in the seat depth. It looks likes she really wants to like the bouncer, but she is just too small for it. Maybe we'll give it another try in a month or so."
2,"didn't fit our doors, either","Our baby LOVED this jumper while visiting a friend's house. We like the colors and the bumper, and the price ($33). We wouldn't use the little toys, the jumping is stimulation enough.However, our house was built at the turn of the century and has about 6"" molding on the top of each door, and the doorway is a little 'deep.' Between the width and the height, the clamp just isn't tall enough to fit any doorway in our house. Although the specs I saw talked about doorway 'width' for the clamp, it didn't say anything about large moldings (and I didn't even think about it until it arrived).So I wish the stethoscope-looking part of the clamp were about 2"" longer, so that the jumper could fit on our door jambs. Our 6-month-old actually looked disappointed to see the jumper from his friend's house and then not be able to go in it.I am really disappointed too."
3,Nice product - poor amazon item description,This seems well made -but it is only rated for use with babies less than 25 lbs. The item description makes no mention of this...thank goodness we get the shipping box dimensions and not the baby dimensions. We're having a great time letting our shipping box jump up and down in this product.
2,Might not work with large door trim,"I received this jumper as a hand-me-down. I think my son would really like it, but it doesn't fit over our door trim. Our trim is 5/4 x 6. We have regular height doors (6'-8"") in 2x4 and 2x6 walls. It seems like it would probably work with 1x4 trim or smaller. I looked at Graco's product instructions and they do not specify trim size (other than it must be at least 1/2"" thick), so if you have large or deep mouldings you might want to check it out in a store before ordering."
4,Works great if you have door frame molding!,"We love the idea of this! It really is simple to use with one major caveat- make sure you have door frame molding before ordering. It turns out that our apartment does not, which we learned when we went to hang up the jumper for the first time. At first, I thought this was an odd feature of our apartment, but now I find myself checking out door frames everywhere and have come to appreciate how non-standard door frames are. Anyway, for now it lives at a friend's house and our daughter uses it when we go over there to play. She loves bouncing in it, but it did take a time or two before she really go the idea."
4,Very Nice Jumper,"This bumper jumper is super cute. It's easy to adjust the height and hasn't damaged any walls. The bumper is also a nice feature. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the toys were always right in our son's face when he turned his head to either side, so we just removed them."
5,bumper jumper,"My 6 month old grandson loves it. He could bounce for hours. Very portable and well constructed. The toys could have stronger velco, they tend to be easily pulled off the toy. He will just pick them up from the tray with his month. Not really a problem, just a little annoying when they fall to the floor. Easy to assemble. Great product."
5,Little Jumper,I purchased for my 6 month old grandson. He loves to jump and will jump forever. It is so funny to watch him. Great way to keep him busy and entertained.
2,missed much of the chicago scene,focused to much on gay bars/people not enough on the bars/clubs where the bands played and punks went who made the scene. not enough people with spiked hair and Mohawks with black leather on.we went to the clubs we walked the streets we hung out on corners and parking lots in numbers this movie failed to show the scene well at all. i guess it is hard to show over 8 years on one dvd a part two would be nice.
3,Close(r) - but still not worth the money,"FileMaker Pro 7 (and it's new version 8) have one leg up on Microsoft Access: the are cross-platform. You can use FileMaker on Macs and PCs. Microsoft doesn't make an Access for Mac, either stand-alone or bundled with Office.If you don't know how to use Access, if you don't know too much about relational database management systems, FileMaker is probably for you. It's much easier to use than Access. But if you have invested the time to learn Access enough to do the basics - create tables, complex queries, and forms, and to produce useful reports - stick with Access.Switching to FileMaker means learning a whole new system, and once you do, you will not be any more productive than you already are."
1,Paper wont feed,"Other features, such as the scanner, work fine, and it prints fine, the trouble is, I have to push the paper in to get the printer to grab it (paper wont feed). I can't print more than one page at a time. I DO NOT recommend this printer to anyone. Completely disappointed in it."
2,HP PSC 1600 Bad printer. Do not Buy!,"This printer is the worst printer I've ever had the bad luck to buy. Do not buy this printer, you will be frustrated. I will never buy another HP printer again."
1,POS 1600,I've had two of these. I have no idea why I bought the second one but both were terrible. They constantly say there is a jam when there isn't one. There's always an error message for something and I spend more time trouble shooting and praying that it will print than I do actually printing anything. Don't waste your money.
3,My own chili is better,"But you can expand your knowledge with a book anyhow right? I gotta say, The marlboro cookbooks generally are pretty damn good recipes"
2,its ok,This is a nice mp3 player but I had it about 4 months when it no longer would charge/turn on nothing. which bummed me out because I loved it
3,Its Aight,"This was my first mp3 player, it got the job done. The only problems I had were that it didn't have enough memory, and the songs don't sync in order so you have to search for the song that you want to listen to. But it plays pretty good."
3,Not very durable,"the plastic battery retaining tabs broke after about 50 charges. It still works, assisted by a rubber band."
3,Not So Great For Calphalon .....,"I have more than a few Caphalon pots and pans in my cookware group ... This one is pretty, but not very efficient. Likely due to shape, since it has less pan bottom on the stove burner than other designs of the same capacity, but it takes WAAAYYY to long to bring a half pot of water to boil (that's even with using the very high quality glass lid on the pot).I'm a bit disappointed with this one. First time I've said that about a Caphalon product. I'm still giving it a 3 since it maintained a boil (with lid) on very low heat. It's just that attaining the boil is not up to the Caphalon standards I'm used to."
2,Not recommended,"I love calphalon, but this stainless steel is not recomemnded. Not easy to clean and food sticks to it."
4,"Love the Pot; the Handle, Not So Much","I love this pot, I use it more than any other. It's perfect particularly for sauces or gravies or anything involving a roux because the wisk can get into the corners (something that, ironically, one can't do with a so-called ""sauce"" pan). It heats evenly, has a nice weight (which you'll want if you cook; if you don't cook and want light, get Mirro), never sticks (if it sticks for you, your heat's up too high), and it's easy to clean (though occasionally you'll need to use Bar Keeper's Friend). One can also ""flip"" with it.The handle, unfortunately, is the same sort of handle used by all the higher-end cookware manufacturers these days and is too rounded, when it should be more flat (like what you find on very old iron pans). This can create problems if you're trying to pour or drain using only one hand (the handles on the old Magnalite were near-perfect).All things considered, though, if my house were burning down, this is the first pan I'd grab."
4,Great pan but too small of handle & bad rivet placement,"Overall, another nice addition to the Calphalon collection at my house.I'm disappointed by the size of the handle and the placement of the rivets. I read another review about the rivets, but unfortunately I read it after I'd already purchased it. The rivets definitely get in the way and collect pieces of food. However, it isn't bad enough for me to return it. Just a word of warning for others.Second, the handle is just plain small. I don't have big hands... This handle just doesn't provide me the security I'm looking for when I'm transferring water from the sink to the stove, for instance.Lastly and probably unrelated to the manufacturer and more the seller - the condition of the rim was less than stellar. This product almost seemed used because there are visible pits in the rim of the pan. Again, I really wanted this pan and am just a bit too lazy to bother sending it back over imperfections that won't affect my food."
5,fine multipurpose pan!,"This is my latest Tri-Ply acquisition, and it's wonderful. I've used it for lightly sauteing a big batch of vegetables- (think buttery sugarsnap peas for 8, broccoli and cauliflower with melted cheddar, etc), for a hearty cream soup for 4, pasta primavera, spaghetti sauce, cheesy grits, and much more. The rounded sides make whisking and reducing or thickening a sauce easy, and it's perfect for browning or softening chopped vegetables like onions before making a sauce in the same pan. The nice close-fitting glass lid reduces the temptation to let the steam out while peeking. I use it at least twice a week, more when we have houseguests. Like every other Tri-Ply pan, it's very efficient- never have to use more than a medium-low gas flame. It cleans easily- soak, suds, and swish, and things don't stick at all when I remember to gently warm the pot (and let any cold ingredients come to room temp)first. Good pot, highly recommended."
2,Dangerous flaw in an otherwise great pot,"I really loved this pan (I've had it for years), but it has a dangerous flaw. The sides of the pot are sloped and the handle is narrow, so if you lift the hot pot off the stove, if the pot is full, it's very easy for the pot to tilt over (the handle rotating in your hand, even if you have a normal grip on it--there is no handle on the opposite side of the pan to prevent this from happening). If this happens, it sloshes boiling water all over the stovetop, yourself, or anybody nearby (God forbid you have a little one underfoot). I'm a pretty careful cook, and this has only happened to me once, but it's also happened to my husband and my mom the first time they used the pot. I'm sadly considering retiring the pan just because I'm afraid that someone else, a babysitter, might use it and have an accident."
4,Great upgrade from a small monitor,"If you have a small, outdated (perhaps one of those big box) monitors, the V7 22"" will suit you just fine. It's big and great for watching videos like Netflix downloads from across the room. The built-in speakers are pretty good too, though they aren't high-def.The resolution (while listed as the same as my 21"" iMac), however, is not nearly as crisp. I can't be sure if it would be any different if I was linking it up to a desktop computer instead of my laptop (I set up the extended monitor correctly, fyi), but the picture just isn't ideal.Of course, if you're upgrading from one for those 15"" boxes, this will seem like a dream."
5,Love it!,We really enjoy this nice LARGE monitor. It works very well for watching NetFlix movies (instant downloads).
4,Very Nice but not Great,"I bought this monitor because it fit in the bookshelf case on mt desk. This is a second monitor on my computer. First if you put the monitor in 1600 x 1200 the screen becomes bigger than the monitor, so the display moves when the curor gets to the edge of the screen. I set the display to 1680 x 1050 and the display fits the monitor with no moving around. If you are purchasing this monitor because it has speakers - don't. The speakers sound like a tin can phone. Buy a real speaker system. I find that its real hard to purchase monitors over the internet because I can't determine the picture quality. There are better monitors but not at the price I purchase this one at. I recommend standing in the store for 30 minutes and visually compare monitors before purchasing and never purchase a monitor for anything but the display."
1,Perfect Secrets Not a Perfect book!,"I agree with the other reviewer, it did not keep my interest either and was hard to follow and was just pretty darn boring and not a perfect romance book companion, I have read much better short story romance companions that really kept my interest!"
2,A little bit too technical,"Very highly technical. I thought they were going to explain chapter per chapter of Revelations. Instead author talked about doctrines, definitions, etc... I loss interest after a couple of pages."
4,Revelation Explained,I am satisfied with the book that I purchased from amazon. It is what I was looking for.Doris Kanitz
3,Not eligible for Prime or Super Saver Shipping,"Just a warning to Prime members: You will have to pay shipping for this item. The reason why it's not eligible for Prime is beyond me, considering I've seen a printer that would cost 5 times as much to ship that is eligible (and both are direct from Amazon, not third-party sellers). If you have Prime, it's almost cheaper just to buy the 5510, because it is eligible as of March 28."
5,A dream book for youngter,"I read this book just 1 time in Vietnamese thirty some years agoas well as Nobody's boy(Sans famille) but the whole book,I think, will stay for the rest of my life.Now it's time for my daugther to enjoy what I did a long time ago."
2,Simplistic,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. The writing style was inconsistent and the layout was visually obnoxious. I mention this because if there was any useful information in this book, the presentation distracted from it incredibly.The primary points in this book were elementary, and most people could be more creative and productive without this book. I would not recommend this book. If you have a good business plan, have a group of friends read it, take them out to dinner and brainstorm. You will have more fun, and get a better return on investment."
5,Great for Kids having trouble in school.,Faraday beat all the odds.Everyone including the kingcame down on him.Faraday showed them all.I consider Faraday's work equal if not greaterthan Ben Franklin's.Willyt Electrical Engineer
3,A fairly average biography,"Based on the glowing review above, I ordered this book hoping to assign it for summer reading for 10th graders who will be studying electricity and magnetism next year. Unfortunately, like many biographies written for high schoolers, the book is clumsily written and fairly boring. Parts of it are written like a fictionalized account, and parts like a biography, with quotes from Faraday's letters. There is little sense of Faraday's experimental method, which is arguably the most interesting aspect of his career. Overall, I'm afraid reading this book would decrease, rather than increase, the students' interest in the subject. So I'm still looking for a good biography of Faraday..."
1,i disliked this book.,"i was appaled to think that someone who was born in that period of time could actually interest the likes of the people now, it was not only boring but i wish what i had read would have been more sightful into his experiments than his life!"
3,Check calibration,"The first level I received was out of calibration. On receiving a second I checked the calibration several times and found varying results, most within tolerance. In any case, be sure to check it and be sure to check the level bubbles when in use. It is difficult to use outdoors as the spot mode is the brightest (The rotating line is worthless outdoors) and jumps when moving it instead of a slow movement so it is difficult to spot it on your rod (and you need the remote otherwise you are running back and forth to move the dot). In my experience , the self leveling devices are consistently more accurate. the ""Robotoolz""(comes with remote) is a great tool for nearly the same price but does not have the vertical line nor rotates continually. But the motor moves the spot to any location you want it. For stuff like outdoor form setting it works great for an inexpensive unit."
3,Very easy to use,"and versatile. Has many different beams and a cool remote. The remote was kind of tricky to use; it didn't always get the laser to respond when I wanted to change modes. Also, the beam isn't very powerful, and even with a red plastic target it's hard to see in the sunlight. The included red goggles help a lot. Now I'm hoping to find a laser target to attach to the survey rod so we don't have to sped so much time trying to see the beam on the rod...Basically a great tool at a good price."
2,just like cheap chinese product,"From the company website:...""the artisans at the Johnson Products Company handcrafted custom products with pride. From shoeshine kits to wooden toolboxes, their sense of artistic accomplishment was ever present..."" not here, it looks like it is made at Chinese mass production plants, with cheap faded plastic that came out of a bad mold and fits poorly. May be I got a got a bad one but I am very disappointed with this unit, it has the Johnson name and looks like something you buy at Harbor Freight Tools. The product arrived out of calibration, It took a lot of time adjusting it for level until gently pressing the power bottom, then you have to adjust again, it is going back. When I finally got working, it just stopped spinning before I could take the measurement!"
5,"Forgive Me, My Love","This very dynamic and somewhat dark CD is probably one of the best alternative rock releases of modern Russian music. Quality sound, talented musicians, emotional lyrics - all portray the mystery of the Russian soul. This music isn't just for sale; it is from the heart and for the heart. The CD includes popular hits ""Iskala"" (I was looking for...), ""Hochesh?"" (Do you want?), ""Sozrela"" (She's matured (ripened)). Definitely a unique CD - if you are interested in Russian music, this would be a good one to start your collection with."
3,A compassionate story,"An incentuous-type of family story shared in compassionate fiction. As well as it was written, I felt the characters somewhat shallow and the story not timely and realistic. Still, I would recommend to read; very easy to get through the story to the end."
3,Enjoyable but overly melodramatic,"I am a longtime reader of this author and was initially excited by the chance to learn more about the future life of Camilla Dickinson. While the book had a somewhat entertaining plotline, certain elements such as the ending and the device of Raffi's conversation with her grandmother seem cliched. The author also tends to repeat her points ad nauseam---how many times do we have to hear Olivia tell Camilla how much the family loves her, or hint at a dark family secret, before we get the picture. A little more subtlety would have improved the story. Finally, although the author may be making a comment on the irrelevancy of earthly time, I was annoyed and distracted by the author's transposition of the Kennedy assassination to springtime rather than fall when it actually happened. It disturbs an otherwise realistic storyline."
3,"Liked it, but wanted more","I've just started reading L'Engle's adult books, and the habit of starting the story at the end seems entrenched - we learn about the plot from the memories and feelings of the characters.I enjoyed the book, and stayed up too late to finish it, but at the end I felt unsatisfied. The backward looking mode made many of the character's actions seem contrived, and reduced much of the suspense. The story concerned Taxi, Camilla, Mac and Frankie the most, but the revelations that built the plot came through the distress of Raffi, Camilla's granddaughter. Frankly, I can't see myself getting emotionally wrung out over the question of my grandmother's exact genetic relation to me, so I didn't have much sympathy for Raffi. And the final ending seemed silly.I give this books great credit for most of the small details, but the whole does not hang together."
3,"Yes, But","I totally agree with the other reviewers; this is a very good book and I hope that the author will update it as new data become available. My one major complaint is that he's much too lenient towards the Qin dynasty Fa Jia / Legalists. Just read Arthur Waley's _ Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China _ which provides numerous quotes from their chief writings: the Book of Lord Shang and the Han Fei Zi. One author describes the Book of Lord Shang as ""as chilling a platform for rule as has ever been written other than _ Mein Kampf _"". And he's much too kind to the Qin dynasty, saying it fell only because Qin Shi Huang died relatively young. It was foolish for Qin Shi Huang to allow a cad such as Zhao Gao to have such influence that the crown prince was duped into committing suicide and the prime minister Li Si executed. To this day the Chinese have the expression ""to call a deer a horse"" from an incident involving Zhao Gao. Tyranny has its consequences."
3,Follow-Up,"For Trisha Yearwood, she has had some of the best songs in the Country field of the music industry. Her song There Goes My Baby, is a pretty nice follow-up to her hit How Do I Live from Con Air. Although I didn't like her other song, One More Chance, it makes a good opener to anybody who hasn't heard Trisha Yearwood before. It is just a shame she hasn't been able to keep it up after that song from the Nicholas Cage film though. Hopefully, she will again, because she has a very nice voice."
4,JUST O.K.,"THE STORY LINE WAS FAIRLY GOOD, BUT I GOT THE CHARACTERS MIXED-UP TOWARDS THE ENDING. I'M GLAD I READ THE BOOK AND WILL DEFINATELY READ MORE OF DEBRA WEBB BOOKS, BUT DO HOPE THEY ARE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THIS ONE."
3,"Definatly not the best, but decent.","They Key to enjoying this book is perspective. You have to realize and accept before reading it that the pages will be filled with a thin storyline and partially two dimentional characters. But face it, that is what the majority of fantasy novels consist of. As for the good stuff, Cook doesnt bog the reader down with excessive characters (cough JORDAN) and with thousands of sideplots per book (cough JORDAN). His novels are short and to the point. THe characters are just interesting enough to keep you reading. The Black Company is in interesting enough book to make you feel like your two dollars you spent on the bargain rack didnt go entirely to waste. Need a quick read or two between more serious novels or while waiting for George Martin to finish his next damn book? Go for Cook. He's worth a try at least."
1,"Ok, strap in.....","I've read my share of fantasy/sci-fi in my time, and some are good, some are bad, but this is an atrocity. I cannont believe for a second that this book was even considered for publication much less even published. There is no excuse for the writing style in this book. Little to no description of anything, land, cities, charecters nothing, and what description exists in the book is compleatly unnessecary. The charecters are shallow, empty and feel like they belong in a teenagers DnD game. The diolouge is immature,inaccurate to the setting and feels like it was written by an 11year old. Through out this experiance in this book I was never abel to follow what was going on once. There is zero direction and even less sense of whats going on. May God forgive you Mr.Cook, for I cannot."
5,Brilliant,"What can I say that has not already been said? Brilliant characterization, enough detail to paint the landscape without Jordan-esque overwriting, and a great story. I cannot recommend this book highly enough - I buy used copies whenever I can to give to people."
1,Couldn't get through it,"The book is very poorly written and very disjointed. Major parts of the story background are missing and the book seems to move too fast through the plot. Some back story would have been nice and some reasoning behind why the characters are doing what they are doing. Also, it seems like there is a mix of high fantasy and modern warfare here that just doesn't work."
4,A good read,I'm a big fan of GRR Martin but having read all of the GoT he's written to date I needed something else. Wasn't sure but had heard some good reviews about The Black Company so I thought I give it a try. I must say I was not disappointed. A very good read not as grity as GoT but very entertaining I liked it better than Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen which I read the first three of but thought I'd give The Black Company a shot and I glad I did.
2,Why is this book rated so high?,"I've seen this book almost always listed near the top of many book review lists, and I have *no* idea why it deserves so much praise. I wanted so much to like this book when I started reading it, but there was no way that I could convince myself it was as great as everyone makes it out to be. Then I thought it was just me who didn't care for it, until I found another die-hard book reader who considered it one of the worst books he's ever read. It's not MY worst book I've ever read, but I fail to find any merit in The Black Company worthy of the clout it has generated. It definitely had its moments, but so do most other books. This is one of those classic times that one needs to simply read the first chapter to realize if this book is for them."
2,Drawn out,"I had really high hopes of reading this book after reading the other reviews. The premise is very interesting but the story is so rushed and the plot flies by and the book is over before you really have an understanding of what is happening. The charcters bring new meaning to the term ""one dimensional"" in that any description or personality does not go beyond their name. Then new chracters are introduced in a way as you are supposed to already know them. It was frustrating i really did enjoy some aspects of the book which is why i did not give it a 1. But I ahd to really struggle to finish it, I did not care enough about the series to even start the second book I had already bought. Moral: save your money!!"
4,B-plus dark military fantasy,"Not for the squeamish. Cook writes well in an unusual style, a lot of short sentences and relatively little description. Combat itself is mostly glossed over - ""he killed him"", ""they fought"", whatever, very few blow-by-blows - but the main character and his group are definitely not the good guys.Originally a collection of short stories, I think, with an end in mind. Works well enough as a book, although I don't really think it was conceived as a series - the ending of this one is pretty conclusive.Cook knows his weapons and knows his world, but he also knows people; the characters have more depth than ninety-five percent of the fantasy I've read.If you like Tolkienesque elves-and-princesses fantasy, you'll hate this. This is moraliry-neutral non-technological military fiction, really. I liked it."
2,"an ok read, but...","...I understand that his characters were mercenaries. However, I truly dislike, Glen Cook's casual treatment of rape in this book. I will read no more books of his because of it."
2,I don't get it,"As other people have noted, this book, and the series it begins, are a sort of underground fantasy cult classic. But I just don't get it. To me the novel seemed directionless and confusing, the world in which it takes place not very well defined. Unlike novels by some of the giants of fantasy - Tolkien, Goodkind, Jordan - I didn't feel like I could grasp the characters or their world."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"The Black Company is a mercenary for hire unit with a lot history and traditions. One of these is recording its own exploits and personnel via the Annals - which also provides commanders a reference and advice for future situations.What is different with the setup for this book is that the company in question have chosen to sign up with a woman that is actual an undead sorceress, and she has friends. As in, she is an evil overlord type, and so are the 9 others, but worse things exist. The Company is part of a fight to put down a rebellion.The Company is famous for fulfililng its contracts, but when they find out the nasty situation they are in some hard choices and quick actions need to be taken.Military adventure and dark fantasy you would call this, I suppose. Excellent and gripping, and the start of a long series.4.5 out of 5"
5,A very rare find.,"In the massed market of fantasy novels that now fill the bookstore shelves, it is rare find to come across a book that has it's very own feel. The black company was thrilling, there are no knights in shineing armour, or damsels in distress. It has a very dark undercurrent which is rarely done. I found this book to be a very refreshing change from the nursey ryhme style fantasy. Not everyone will enjoy the series, but if you are looking for something a little different then by all means give this one a read."
2,Not the best,"With all the glowing, five star reviews on this site, I have to concede there's a strong possibility that I simply didn't ""get"" some important aspect of the book. I thought I'd post a dissenting review anyway, though, just to show that it is possible to not like this book, if nothing else. I thought the characters were week and hard to identify with, the plot wasn't even worth caring about, and there was no underlying point or redeeming value whatsoever. This is military fantasy, and that's a very specific field that maybe not everyone would fully appreciate. My advice: be aware of your tastes before you buy this book."
3,"Dark and Foreboding, But Not What I Expected","The Black Company is a tightly knit band of mercenaries that are not in the least bit softhearted. They do what they have to in a world that's overrun by evil. Now the Company has been hired by one of the Lady's minions, Soulcatcher, to do her bidding. Their job is to aid her in her fight against the Rebel. The story is told by Croaker, the Company's doctor and historian. As with any novel told in first person, the plot is limited to what the storyteller knows. So if Croaker is left out of something, or doesn't know the reasoning behind something, then neither does the reader. I wasn't thrilled with the book, but neither did I dislike it. I found myself not knowing if the Lady was Evil or Good, whether the Rebel was Evil or Good, or if both of them are Evil. And if both of them are Evil, then who's Good? I was a little confused about parts of the story, and short of re-reading it, I probably will remain so."
5,The lesser of evils.,"I've read all of the BC novels twice. This is a great series.It is about Evil and EVIL. Which is the lesser of the two and which Evil will pay the Black Company. The Dark and Evil world is controled by powerful Evil beings and the Black Company is a pawn. As you read it, ask yourself ""which evil would I choose?"" and ""what are the real plans of each Taken?""Kick back and enjoy the antics of One Eye and Goblin, the mages that can't turn food into... but they'll entertain you and their comrades.If you are not hooked after reading the first 2 chapters, take the book back and choose a new hobby."
3,These are wicked men,"As a fan of Steven Erikson's series I was interested in reading The Black Company. Now that I've read it I can see that quite a bit of fantasy writing as been strongly influenced by Glen Cook, Robert Jordan and G. R. R. Martin come to mind as well as Erikson. I will agree with most reviews that yeah, it's a pretty entertaining read. This novel is a bit rough and sketchy by contempory standards, contains a couple of homophobic slurs, and our narrator dreams of having sex with a pair of 12 year old girls. These are wicked men under contact to an evil witch. The plot is spoty and rather limps along until the final two chapters when it advances, and there are quite a few typos. I think this book could use a revised edition. A sometimes entertaining read for those interested in a writer who has influenced modern fantasy."
2,don't waste your time,"I will admit that I enjoyed this book when I read it. Despite its incredibly shallow charecters and its indifferent writing I enjoyed it. Despite the fact that the bad guys were known by such names as Nightcrawler and Shapechanger I enjoyed it. But after reading this book and several of the ones that come after it I was left with the feeling that I wasted my time. if you are looking for a trashy piece of fluff to get you through the night read this book, but if you want something remotely meaningful my advice is to move on."
1,"Poorly written, nearly impossible to get through.","I have tried on at least four occasions to get through this book. Each time I find myself struggling to make sense of the sentences. It feels like someone has shut of my brain after the first line. I seems as though it is a terrible translation from some other language. Every sentence is halting, with absolutely no flow. The dialog rarely makes any sense, and it is a struggle just to know who is talking at any given time. It amazes me that something so poorly written was ever published. My comments all apply to the text itself, not necessarily to the story. I can't comment on that because I can't find it in the jumble of words that have been haphazardly dumped on the pages."
4,a nice change of pace,"the black company is refreshing, in that it is not the ""underdog good guys"" against the epitome of all evil. since tolkien, it seems that fantasy authors have rehashed the same script over and over again (sometimes with some originality and success, and more often that not without either one). the black company's universe is full of shades of gray. the characters seem more real, and make decisions that we can empathize with."
2,"A thin, underwritten disappointment.","I went into this book with high expectations, seeing as how there are so many people who enjoyed it. It read more like a plot outline than an actual novel, with thin characters, sketchy descriptions, little sense of mood or atmosphere, and a plot one finds it hard to care two cents about. Too bad, as I really wanted to like it. The point of view of Croaker is mildly interesting, but never really developed into a character driven piece that engages the reader. And all that silliness between One-Eye and Goblin... puh-lease. I guess if you've read every other fantasy ""formula"" out there, you might find this one diverting. As for me, I'm still finding much more interesting fare to read..."
1,Nothing to review,I still do not have the cable. Six weeks seems a bit long. I am not sure what the problem is
1,Poor copy,Not what it appears to be. Different than the Picture and the original. Only has one magnet and not strong enough to download the software from my camera to the computer. Do not buy.
3,All regions?,"Unfortunatly, I was misled in the false pretention that this set was ""All Regions"" as opposed to the others that were all Region 2. It's really disapointing to buy something that says ALL REGION and IT IS NOT. I loved that TV Series who show a character with a more abrupt profile and who wasn't into womanizing. But again, let's be honest here, Make sure ""All Regions"" really means what it says. And by the this whole schemes about ""Regions"" today is ridicululous! Why did the business did that? With the internet today anybody can order from all over the world. So I don't understand why this policy is still in forceMan in a Suitcase"
4,Excellent addition to collection.,"This book is a great starting point for any fan of The Andy Griffith Show. There is no single book that puts together everything that a fan would want, but this one is a must have. Coupled with other books that Amazon recommends on The Andy Griffith Show, Robinson's book is an excellent addtion to a collection."
5,I really do use it every day!,"This pan is well constructed and fun to use. I've used it for everything from grilled cheese sandwiches to bolognese sauce (as pictured) to seafood dinners and everything in between. It is not hard to clean -- if you let it cool to room temperature, then put some hot sudsy water in it to soak, any stuck on food comes right up. It's a beautiful and useful addition to the kitchen."
5,Absolutely love it!,I recently purchased the Calphalon Tri-Ply 12 in Everyday Pan and absolutely love it!I have used it to cook everything from eggs to liver and onions. It worked great and the clean up was easy. I went out and also bought 2 other Calphalon Tri-Ply pans.
2,The Dinosaurs will roar on your screen.,"Some films should really be seen in a movie theater or drive-in. Jurassic Park (1993) and the following sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park III (2001) should be.We all became accustomed to Dinosaurs by watching the Godzilla film series, the original NBC, Land Of The Lost (1974-77),One Million Years B.C.(1966), The Flintstones cartoon series (1960-66) or even visited the Los Angeles La brea Tar Bits.I won't give away any of the story, but you do have an all-star cast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, B.D. Wong, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.The dinosaurs may be way too frightening for young children.My suggestion is to buyLand of the Lost: Season 1(1974), starring Spencer Milligan, Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman."
4,"Popper, Condensed and Referenced","This is a fine book which details Popper's final thoughts on all of his theories, and the long road that led him there. Everything is well coordinated with cross-referenced citations for all of his major works and trends.I would give it 5 stars, but as Popper would be the first to acknowledge, there is always room for improvement!"
1,Karl Popper's books are better than this introduction,"I've always found Karl Popper's writing clear and understandable. This 'introduction', though apparently written in english, is neither."
3,protest pop,"Ze Keti was a well-known protest singer/songwriter in Brazil in the sixties and recorded quite a few albums. This collection showcases his best-known songs, and they are all quite beautiful complex compositions. They have the shiny pop arrangements of similar-period albums by folks like Nara Leao - so if you like her work, you'll probably like this; I actually prefer Zelia Barbosa's versions on her Sertao y Favela album - they're stripped-down, raw, and emotional. But if you like the Brazilian protest bossa sound, you should give Keti's music a try!"
2,Sizing information,"When I ordered these for my husband, I needed size 11D. The size came up on the choices so I ordered them. The acknowledge came back 11A and I tried to correct it or cancel it but this could not be done. I had to let the slippers come and, being way too narrow, had to return them for credit. Cost me over $8.00 to return them."
5,slippers,My husband has had these slippers before and these are the only kind he likes. I have also bought them for a friend and he enjoys them too.
3,alabama shopper,"My father has been wearing this style of Evans brand slippers for many years. Unfortunately, they have changed a lot since his last pair. While they used to come fully leather lined--this pair has only the heel lining in leather. Also--the sizing has changed. I had to exchange this purchase for a shoe a full size larger than his previous slippers or any other shoe he now wears."
2,Disappointed with this slipper.,"My husband had a pair of these several years ago, made by the same manufacturer. This pair is stiff and not true to size. At this price, the quality should be very nice. They even look cheap! He has tried to break them in unsuccessfully, so I can't return them -- I will never buy L.B. Evans again."
4,Slippers,Excellent quality & overall good value. Size runs slightly smaller than regular shoes. Overall a very nice slipper.
5,perfect,this is so toutching and sad. it is very educational and i am happy that i ordered it. let me knw if u have anything similar
5,New Insight,"We actually borrowed this selection from our local library. You will find new insight into the development of auschwitz as a concept here, along with fascinating ( and often troubling ) interviews from actual survivors and Nazi SS personnel. Highly Recommended viewing-- not exceptionally gory or graphic, but extremely informative. This documentary stops short of discussing the details of the final horrific months of auschwitz history--- maybe there is a follow up documentary in the works."
3,can find it cheaper @ barnes and nobel,"Good dvd...you can get this for less @ a major media store. Try Barnes and Nobel...another one you should buy/watch is ""The Nazis..A warning from History' it comes with a 2 hour special on Auswitz..."
4,"Very good, not great","WIsh it spent more time on what it was like during a typical day/week/month at Auschwitz. Overall a very well done ""broad"" sketch of the Nazi's."
1,Are You Kiddin Me!?!?!?!?,"The cover of this DVD looks really interesting and plus it is made by the BBC, which I thought was definite plus, and it also had supposedly glowing reviews shown here on Amazon, so I could not wait to watch this to get the complete study of Auschwitz and the holocaust.But to my dismay, this documentary centered completely almost througout its entirity on computer graphics, Actors , hardly any real documentary film, which is uncalled for . It was just recreated history absolutely, the producers I guess think people are just so naive to just accept everything along with whatever recreated episodes of reality that they choose. I mean we are talking absolutely rewriting history here. Nothing but recreated acting and computer graphics to show us everything. Are you people really that naive????!!!"
1,Absolute nonsense.,"At the end of the war, it was claimed that four million people died here. Then, in 1989, that number was reduced to 1.1 million. Yet to this day, they are STILL claiming six million Jews were murdered. How does that make sense. This is nothing more than anti-German propaganda. It really IS nothing new."
3,Leaving Lucy.,"Lucy Camden's gotta be in the back of Bev's mind as she belts out these country tunes. It's quite a good CD: fresh, modest and honest. Everything a country singer's debut album should be. Heaven On Earth Down Here is quite clearly the winner on this CD but there are other songs certainly worth listening to. Beverley is one talented gal."
4,little chef,"Just perfect for a todler who is excited with cooking with mom and dad or with the Tv. Well made with an adjustable hat, great gloves anhpd a perfect apron. Just what I was looking for and at a good value."
3,"The Immortal Series, My views","The Immortals series was a good follow up, though I read it last, rather than second. I liked the way Tamora included the ALanna theme, Tortall etc. I especially enjoyed Daine's growing crush on Jon! A very good book, like the Winding Circle series, it focuses largely on magic, though in this quartet more the Wild Magic that Daine posesses over the GIft of Numair.."
3,A mediocre fantasy,"This is was my first (and so far only) Tamora Pierce book I've read, and despite what I've heard, I can't say I particuarly like her writing style, it's not bad, but not my favorite. A girl named Daine heds a call for help by the Lone Lake Wolf Pack, who, as far as I understand it, she used to live with. When she gets there however, she finds a dark sceme much larger than she ever would have ever imagened. Daine had all the qualifications of a good character, but for some reason I never felt connected to her or the story. I'm not really sure why that is. I would have given it 3 and a half stars if I'd had the option, I've talked to alot of people who do really like it, but personnaly, I'd recommened the Avalon Web of Magic/Quest for Magic series (by Rachel Roberts) or the Silverwing sequence (by Kenneth Oppel) instead. Wolf Speaker - good, but not great."
5,a great continuation to the first in this series,"If you've read the first one, read this one! It's a great continuation where Daine learns more about her powers and meets a lot of new animals. If you haven't read the first one, read that one, too, and make sure to read the rest of this series too^_^"
2,ZzzZzZzz.....,"This is the most boring book in the whole entire Immortals Series. The book dragged on and on and on...After finishing the series, I don't even think I needed to bother reading this book. Daine helps her wolf friends and Numair turns some mage into an apple tree. She also discovers some new ability or advancement in her wild magic. That about synopsizes the entire book. I've read All of Tamora Pierce's books and I can definitely say that this book was the worst out of all of her books that I've read. It lacked excitement and adventure. It's the only book of hers that I haven't read twice."
3,"The Alanna series is good, but Immortals is disappointing.","I'm getting a bit tired of the animal communication already, and this is only the second book. Don't get me wrong, I like animals, but I don't think they would act this way. They're much too human-like. And the environmental themes seem a little too contemporary. Also I find it hard to believe that Daine likes domestic animals such as pigs-- how can a human face talking to an animal that was brought into the world only so that humans can kill and eat it? How could the animal be friendly to her? Daine is not a vegetarian-- the book is quite clear about that. This series, in contrast to Alanna, seems rather childish and reads almost like a cartoon. Song of the Lioness was much more ""mature"". I was actually reluctant to start this book, whereas I couldn't wait to find the next Alanna book. However, it is a slight improvement over Wild Magic, and Stormwings are (surprisingly) shown to have some redeeming qualities."
3,Dunlath,Book 2 in the Immortals seriesThis continues the story of Daine and Numair. Here they travel to Dunlath and meet further animals and magical creatures including some fascinating variations on the usual mythical beasts.I have to confess this is my least favourite TP book to date although it forms an essential part of this series and introduces characters that will appear further in her later books. It also sets the scene for books 3 and 4 of the Immortals series which are much more enjoyable in my opinion.
5,Great read,"This series was so compelling, I couldn't wait for it at the library, and had to buy it. This book is not just for young adults, it is for all readers who enjoy a good series. Do not be put off by having to look in the young adult section. A good story should be enjoyed by all."
3,Not up to snuff...,"I have always loved all of Tammy's books but this one gives you that feeling of let down after reading the first. As I say again, all of her books can and do get dippy and cheesy during some parts, but this one was just not great. It was a good book with a good story but it wasn't as great as a lot of her others---it even got boring. Recommened if you want to follow the seris, though!"
5,A delightful book,I loved this book. It was so fun to read. I think more people should read this book.
2,zaftique.com great but dress sucks,I got this dress the other day and I was very disappointed. It looks exactly like a nightgown and definetly not worth the money.
2,"Disorganized company, mediochre product for the price","I ordered this dress October 27th and finally received it December 1st. It is a plain knit dress with lace and although it fits well and is comfortable, it's clearly not worth $92.00.I waited way too long for this dress. I purchased it to wear at a very important yearly function. If it didn't fit I would have been out of luck."
2,Way too small,"These clips aren't as big as advertised. I got them to clip some material onto a 3/4 pvc pipe, and it didnt' fit. If this sounds like your project, use the 6"" clips."
2,Smaller than expected,These clamps would have been useful if I needed to clamp smaller things. I expected these clamps to be larger and stronger than they actually were.
1,"These are not 4"" clamps.","These are not 4"" clamps. They are 1"" clamps. The jaw opening is about 1"" when fully opened. The rubberizing is a thin coat that looks painted on. Sending back for a refund."
5,useful things,these are the perfect clamps to use to prevent your seatbelt from choking you to death when in a car! also great for holding things together after using glue to repair something.
2,A pre WWII peek into a Balkan family,"This book, while perhaps not of general interest, was fascinating to me, since my husband was born in Sofia, Bulgaria and was a distant relative of the author. The blindness of the participants to the events swirling around them in Europe was startling. Their concerns with business and success overrode any concern with the outside world. Marriage between cousins, uncles and nieces, was common emphasizing the clannishness of the Jewish population. This world ended with the commencement of WW II. The book definitely has a limited audience."
3,Not very good.,"This was reviewed pretty high, so I bought one.The points on the black end are pretty small, so the surface area does not mash mint leaves very well.It takes a lot of time and effort to muddle mint.The metal end should be larger if you want to use that end.I would not recommend this muddler."
3,Burns the toast,"In my experience, this will burn anything set above the lowest setting. 2/10 is about the maximum that I can set it to. I'm hoping this will wear off with time. However, there is ample space, it seems to be durable, and it does the job."
1,The worst toaster ever,I purchased this toaster with the idea I wanted something simple. I read the reviews and felt this one would work well for me. Was I wrong. I have not had a consistently toasted piece of bread or bagel yet. My advice: Don't purchase.
3,slightly disappointed . . .,"This toaster was pretty inexpensive, so I guess I shouldn't have expected too much! Don't think it toasts as evenly as it should, and have to keep adjusting the setting; never seems to get it just right - either not toasted, or bordering on burned."
1,Short-lived toaster,"This was a great, simple toaster... for the first couple of months I owned it. Just four months after purchase it is unusable.Construction seems extremely flimsy. The metal 'carriers' for the bread bent out of shape from normal use. Generally at some point during the toasting process the bread falls off this carrier (either when putting the bread in or when it pops up). This means that the carrier pops up at the end but the bread stays at the bottom of the toaster and requires a fork or something to get it out (with toaster unplugged of course)."
2,the old one was much better,"I had a white sunbeam toaster I dearly loved for years, til I dropped it.So, I decided to stick with the tried and true and get another one.Well, that is a mistake. I guess they don't make them like they used to.Light on one side, dark, almost burnt, on the other side. I turned theselector all the way down to the number 2. Same thing, light one sidevery dark other side. I am not returning it, not at this price and returnpostage, so when I find something better, this one is trashed. To bad,sure loved the old one. Regrets only."
4,Cautiously optomistic,"After doing quite a bit of research on toasters and finding that there was nothing that was clearly an outstanding choice without being too pricey, I decided to go with this economical Sunbeam. Figured since we don't make a lot of toast, we could get by without spending a lot of $. So far, it's ok. It toasts pretty well, except for mini-bagels. Those need to be watched or they will burn.We like the lightness and the small overall size of the toaster - useful since we put it under the cabinet when not in use. I like that there's a separate lever to stop the cycle even if it is a little awkward to work. The fact that it's black works well with both my decor and I anticipate that it will be easier to clean than stainless.Do I expect this toaster to hold up for a long time? Not really, because the plastic shell and inner works don't seem to be very heavy-duty, but then again, neither was the price."
4,Nice little toaster for the price.,"Nice little product. Comparatively small, which is what I wanted. Toasts bread evenly on both sides. Very, very lightweight--so much so that you have to hold it down when pushing the eject or stop buttons.The cord comes out at a strange place and cannot be reconfigured. The designer, apparently, intended for the device to be placed with the long back edge along the wall--rather than perpendicular."
2,Not a good toaster,"This toaster is awful. It doesn't toast well, has a tiny capacity, is difficult to stop mid-toast (when the toast is burning you have to literally pull the plug to get it to stop), and the black plastic looks cheap and has discolored with foggy patches in a very short time with very little use. Would not recommend."
3,Worked well....for 3 months,"Nice inexpensive little toaster. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold it's heat settings for very long. Bought it in August and in late December I started having problems with my toast getting properly browned. I keep having to re-adjust the heat 1/2 way through.Also, the cord is Very short and awkwardly placed. Can't recommend for long term use."
5,Great Toaster,"This toaster does a great job. It is wide enough to fit bagels & yet does a fine job with ordinary bread. For an affordable, good quality toaster, this is the one."
3,Do most toasters toast more on the outside?,"So far I have only toasted english muffins. I noticed that the outside burners seems to burn more brightly than the inside burners. Is this normal? I will be trying to do toast next. If it toasts unevenly, I will be returning it."
1,Plastic Toaster has slots that are too short,"This looked like a good toaster that was reasonably priced and had some decent reviews. When it was delivered, I was surprised to find that it is made mainly out of plastic. The only metal components are the inner pop up trays and the heating elements. Don't be fooled by the ""Cool Touch exterior"" touted in the product features. It's plastic and it feels cheap. Even so, I figured I'd give it a try, so I plugged it in and went to put a slice of bread in the toaster. It didn't fit. Seriously. If you buy the ""square"" wonder bread sized loaf, then this is fine. However, if you buy Orowheat, Nature's Pride or any of the brands that don't sell square bread, you should know this toaster is too small. I can't comment on how it actually toasts because I immediately put it back in the box. I'm sending it back and will find a toaster that actually fits a slice of bread."
3,"It eats Pop-Tarts & the cord is weird, but ok otherwise","Watch out if you're toasting Pop-Tarts. The tray that they (or toast) sit on is not solid, but rather a series of protrusions in alternate directions. It is very easy to put a Pop-Tart too far to the side, so it will go down but then only come partially up, and get eaten by the toaster. If you're even less careful, you can entirely miss the tray altogether so things go down but never come back up.As someone else said, it's weird that the cord is in the front. The cord is also fairly short, so you pretty much have to sit it sideways on your counter.But it does a good job on toast. Haven't tried the bagel button yet. And it was very inexpensive at the grocery store where I purchased it, so overall it's ok."
2,"In the end, not a good purchase...","I bought this toaster and it worked great for a while. I thought...hey its cheaper than the other ones, but doesnt look too cheap. It just stopped working about 7 months after I bought it. I tried and tried and tried to make it work, but I think a fuse or something just burned and pooped out. Would cost more to fix than its worth. I would say just invest in something a little nicer that will last you a couple more years."
1,Bad toaster,"I bought one of these from Target several months ago, and I must agree with the last reviewer. It burns the toast if it is set any higher than 2, and if you have recently made toast (i.e. it has not yet cooled down) it burns it even on the lowest setting. Under no circumstances should you consider using the bagel button, because that also guarantees a burnt bagel."
1,Worst Toaster Ever!,"Worst toaster ever! Do not buy this toaster if you like actual toast. If you like warm bread or charcoal, then this is the toaster for you."
4,sunbeam still makes a good toaster,i bought this toaster to replace my sunbeam from 1962. it is similar in design but not nearly so pretty. the toast cooks evenly on both sides and pops up fairly well with the use of the up button. it is very good value for the money but i still like my chrome one better though sunbeam isn't making one now.
1,horrible design,"The price was right and a 2-slice fits my small kitchen. Ran a cycle without bread on the highest setting to get rid of the awful plastic smell. The toast came out fairly evenly browned. The problem is with the design genius that thought the front corner is the perfect place for a 24"" cord to exit the toaster! This means the unit either has to sit sideways to the plug or the lever/dial has to face the plug, depending on how much counter space you have available. Definitely returning it to the store!"
2,Not true Pentjak,"Although the tecniques in the video are good, there isn't much real pentjak in the video. No history of the art, nothing about the culture. He's taking his own knowledge from the arts he's studied and put them in with the pentjak which is not a bad thing but does make title a little misleading."
4,"Not PJ's best, but thought provoking.","P J O'Rourke has always made me laugh. I've never really considered him a ""conservative"", just someone who enjoys poking fun at people. Liberals just normally have more to ridicule and don't normally have that great a sense of humor. (Witness Al Franken who had the broadside of a barn to hit with Rush Limbaugh and missed almost completely). The problem, if you can call it that, with this book is that it isn't funny enough. The travelogue through the most hellish places on earth is sporadically funny, and often hits many targets, but only really caught fire when he visited his alma mater and made fun of the groups that he saw, especially the men against pornography. At any rate, PJ comes off pretty balanced in this book, and one suspects he may be more of a ""liberal"" than he admits. But I was still waiting for more of the wit that made Give War a Chance and Holidays in Hell so amusing."
4,A 'round-the-world report on political trouble everywhere,"As P.J. O'Rourke points out in this sharply observed collection of essays, ""everything has politics."" As usual, he mixes skewering political insights with laugh-out-loud descriptions of sights and situations he encounters during his 'round-the-world investigations of trouble. His off-the-wall comparisons (Fremont California versus Bangladesh?) are actually quite instructive. I found this book a bit more uneven than some of his other writings, perhaps because he is not reporting on particular events but rather trying to fit anecdotes from a mish-mash of trips into essays about larger more amorphous topics. Enjoyable but a bit too long in places."
5,Brilliantly written,"Extremely entertaining as well as very informative. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.If you're successful and have common sense, this is the book for you. If on the other hand you're ignorant, hateful, or worship Barack Obama, do not buy this book. Instead, go to the nearest protest station and badmouth America, with other socialists who need a bath."
4,This One Takes No Prisoners,"P.J. O'Rourke offers hope to all of us conservatives who really believe that logic and reasoning have a place in the world. Not only does he mercilessly shred the modern neo-liberals who talk a lot about caring for their fellow man as long as they don't have to get their hands dirty, he shatters the stereotype that the Don Henleys of the world would foist upon everyone who thinks overpopulation is a little overblown. O'Rourke is no Falwell follower, he is coarse, he is confident and he is worldly. He is, in short, a breath of fresh air in an underinformed country that takes itself far too seriously"
4,As always...,"PJ delivers as always, this is very funny at times (for a re-born republican that is... lol)"
5,"A witty, commonsense, no nonsense book","Just got this book from our local library on an off chance and can't put it down. I love O'Rourke's wit, his commonsense and ability to cut through humbug. His description of life in Mogadishu and the reason aid did not get to the people dying of famine in Somalia answered so many of my questions. I can't help but think that a lot of his opinions are ""tongue-in-cheek"" and provocative but they certainly make one ponder. O'Rourke the mold was broken when you were born!"
4,Not exactly what I expected,"My wife owns the previous edition of The Calvin Commentaries and I think it was way better. The content is exactly the same, but the quality of the paper is definitely inferior. This is lighter paper which makes each book lighter and thinner. The previous edition had brown hard cover, this new edition is red hardcover with a seal commemorating the 500th anniversary of Calvin's birth.This package comes with the INSTITUTES OF CHRISTIANITY. The previous edition was two volumes, this new edition is just one volume. Again the quality of the paper is inferior and also there are some editions in the content.Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase but not as I expected."
1,Worst Backyard Game,Ratings.Graphics:5Speed:1 (too fast).Players:6 (need more goalies)Voices:4 (Ronny is dorky and has a high and baby voice.Difficulty:1 (I win all the time).If you like hockey get NHL 2003 (it actully has all real players. Wow isn't that better than Ronny Dobbs.Don't waste cash on Backyard Hockey.
1,Defective,"I purchased this game for my daughter for Christmas and it had a defect in the install program. I returned it for another, and the same problem occurred. I have all the system requirements, but I think a bad batch was made. Be careful!"
3,Pick it up if you love Knightfall,"Sword of Azrael is a prequel to the outstanding Knightfall arc. Here we learn a little more about the order of St. Dumas and of the legendary Azrael figure (basically a killer). We are also introduced to Jean-Paul Valley, the guy that will eventually take up the Bat mantle when Bruce Wayne is snapped like a twig. Here we see Jean-Paul as a young man. He is a half-way decent guy with some morals but is compelled by powers he doesn't fully understand that have been lurking in him since childhood, he also seeks revenge for the death of this father. There is something evil in Valley that it will take him down the paths of darkness and ultimatley the the battle of his life with Batman (that's much, much later toward the end of Knightfall). This book is not essential for understanding the Knightfall Arc, but I recommend it to you if you'd like some back-story on Azrael."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Batman comes into conflict with Azrael. This man is an agent of the Order of St Dumas. However, he is also rather unstable, and take that, along with superhuman type abilities and an overweening arrogance, and you end up with a lot of problems.One of those almost supervillain type characters that doesn't mind a large bodycount."
5,Batman Saved,"Believe the 5 star reviews, this is an incredible book. The artwork is some of the best. So many comics have expressionistic style drawings, this one is drawn the way, as Joe Queseda says in his introduction, that makes a comic a collectible. The story is very good; Azrael is an interesting character, and this helps set the rest of the story. I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Strongly reflects it's date,"I love Batman, and I love Denny O'Neil. I reread this the other night and despite a fun story and good mystery I didn't love this book.It's no coincidence thatSpawnand Azrael made their first appearance the same year. Azrael's back story and particularly his troll like mentor seemed out of place in the Batman/Gotham corner of the DC Universe. At times the book seems like a sequel to theThe Da Vinci Code.Bruce Wayne adventuring as himself instead of Batman was a fun change of pace and good old Alfred get's in on plenty of excitement serving a role typically played by Robin.The art by Joe Quesada is superb. I also thought the coloring was particularly good.All in all even a hard core Batfan could take or leave this one."
2,Not great,"This book features the first appearance of Azrael, who later went on to be Batman for about a year. The story is slow and unintriguing, and Batman is way too slow-witted just to build up Azrael."
3,pretty decent read,not a bad read but not as good as i have come to expect and look forward too.But to understand other issues or should i say shed more light on future encounters you really need to read it.
5,More great Bear videos!,"These Bear videos are excellent! My 16 mo daughter loves Bear, and these videos are no exception! I do wish that the potty video was longer, but its a minor complaint. They both have great songs that even *I* catch myself singing throughout the day. Highy recommended!"
1,OUT-OF-DATE AUDIO & NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"All of these albums (and the rest of the Moraz catalog) are now individually available in remastered form, with the mastering supervised by Moraz himself.So, there's no reason to pay big bucks for this OOP, and now sub-standard audio, CD.Here are the links to the remasters:MainhorseRefugeeStory of I"
2,Disappointing Quality,"There aren't a lot of choices when buying glasses this size and the quality control of the company that made these is non-existent. One glass has a major blemish and knob of glass sticking out right in the center of the upper, right where you see and feel it. So this is really a 5 glass set, not 6."
3,Monitor Arm,I thought this was the same monitor arm that was purchased but it was a little different. Not as versitile or easy to set at the newer model. But good for the price.
2,Picture is misleading,"This item as pictured is very hard to find so I was happy to see it offered here even though it was in a smaller size. Unfortunately when I received the product it was the Pet Authority Digestive Supplement NOT the Organic Cat Acidophilus. Although they are similar I have used both and have had much better results with the Oganic Cat Acidophilus. I feel mislead and hope that they replace the incorrect picture with the much smaller squeeze bottle that says ""Digestive Supplement""."
5,Fossils Book,"The Smithsonian Handbooks collection is quite good on this and similar topics. I've had some exposure to items shown in the book and the photos and descriptions here are quite helpful for me, as a beginner to this topic. I'm particularly interested in the ammonites. Great primer to get you interested in the things you've seen already and many of the other types of fossils you haven't."
5,Very nice!,"A very detailed and informative book. The cover feels nice without being a hard back book. I have a want to be paleontologist, and this is probably the most useful book he's received on the subject."
4,This is a great way to discover the story of Pecos Bill,"Robin Williams does a great job of storytelling. This is truely whole family entertainment. Kids will definately sit still for this one, and adults will find it wonderfully funny. Robin Williams infuses the reading with his tremendous energy, wit, and love of adventure. The illustrations in the book are humorous and kids will laugh when they see them. Adults should be aware that there is one picture where Pecos Bill is nude, but it is not full nudity and it is only one picture. All in all I think this, like all Rabbit Ears Productions, is wonderful. I would especially recommend it for anybody who is looking for a great way to keep the kids entertained while they are in the car."
5,A Hot CD!,This CD is really cool.They have really nice voices and sound like they really enjoy what their doing.The CD is jammin'with coolness!!
5,The best from the best...........,"I would like to take the opportunity to say that, as one of the writers, I am honored to be part this quality book. Clara Gerl has been a true joy to work with. The writers are among the best I have encountered. They write from the heart and soul. Shades of Expression is filled with the best from the best."
3,A wonderful mixture,"This book is an outstanding mixture of talent that is present today on the web. I enjoyed the variety in style represented by each author. It Makes for an interesting read, and a fine addition to my growing collection. I commend the publisher for putting together yet another beautiful work of art. BRAVO!"
4,Easy fun clever read,"I have read the Simon Shaw mystery series and find all the books to be entertaining and, important to me, clever. The characters are real and the plots are tight. For a change the protagonist isn't impossibly handsome and six foot plus. The books flow along a good pace. The on-line proof-reading leaves a lot to be desired but putting that aside I recommend Simon Shaw myteries to anyone who likes cozy, armchair whodunnits."
4,Brilliant,"I would say, along with Ruhmore, Fight Club, and Being John Malcovitz, Brain Candy is one of the best movies of the 90's. The Kids in the Hall really knew what they were doing when they made this. The writing is ingenious. The film looks realy good. I'm glad the Kids in the Hall chose Mr. Kelly Makinto direct this film.I'm tired of people calling this movie a ""Saturday Night Live"" type movie, where the show is funny and the movies are terrible. True, the Saturday Night Live films are bad, but this is not the case for Kids in the Hall.The performances by the Kids in this movie are all amazing, but the one that stands out is Mark Mckinney. He was great in the show, but in Brain Candy he really shines.I was a Big fan of KITH before I had even heard of this movie. As soon as I saw this movie I bought it. So get it, you won't regret it."
5,Eagerly awaiting a DVD release.,"Excellent movie, amazingly funny. I love The Kids in the Hall, and you definitely have to be a fan to enjoy the movie as much as I did. The camera work was also very unique (I was impressed, anyway). This is the best movie to come out of Lorne Michaels ever. Better than all the SNL movies combined... so where's the DVD?"
2,Disappointing Candy from the Kids,"I was a huge fan of the Kids in the Hall. That series proved in the late eighties that sketch comedy had life left, even after SNL had drug it through the mud for a decade. I was excited by the idea of a long format sketch but I think it proved to much for the Canadians.The story, of a greedy drug company releasing an untested drug on the market is weak, yes, but that doesn't matter so much. The story is just an excuse to get the various Kids dressed up and making with the funny. My problem with Brain Candy is that the acting which is so endearing in a short sketch is annoying for an hour and a half and the movie is just ugly. I wish I could recommend this flick but I can't. Maybe just watch Animal House again instead."
5,Luke Warm?.........,".....No, Luke Skywalker ya f***in' inbred!! This is the greatest motion picture of all times. This film was, indeed, a natural, evolution from the conventions of their television show which is the greatest television show of all times. They started with a great plot, from which several sub-plots sprouted. From there, they were able to do what they do best; create a bizarre array of distinctly hilarious characters and situations. If you don't think that this is the greatest motion picture of all times, your brain is obviously smaller than the Chicken Lady's brain."
2,"""Brain Candy"" That Really Will Rot Your Brain","As a fan of the Kids in the Hall, I was sorely disappointed by their foray onto the big screen. The full-length movie does not have nearly the appeal that their half-hour syndicated schtick did. Possibly, they suffer from the ""Saturday Night Live"" syndrome in that most movies to come churning out of there do not do so well on film. Who's greenlighting these projects?!?There is hardly any plotline to speak of in this movie, and it is terribly hard to follow the various mini-plots. The characterizations come off as tired and lackluster. It was all I could do to keep my attention peaked through the miserable thing, only out of some loyalty to the Kids. Maybe this movie would have been better with a few glasses of wine in my system, who knows. All I know is, I hope their live touring show was a better success."
1,Brain Candy more like Brain Fart,"I loved the Kids in the Hall T.V. series. There was almost not a single skit that wasn't funny. I didn't think the Kids in the Hall could make anything bad, until I watched Brain Candy. This is by far the dumbest movie I dare say I have EVER seen EVER! I sat watching with amazement, not at how good the thing was, but at the incredibly stupid movie I was devoting two hours watching. This movie is NOT for the uninitiated, nor is it for die-hard KITH fans. Avoid this misconstrued mess like you would the whooping cough. One star (for sympathy to anyone that watches it)."
5,...Its like its 72 degrees in the head all the time...,I bought my copy over a year ago and its almost worn out from too much watching (Is there such a thing??) Offers hours of amusement plus little inside jokes only die hard fans would catch. My favorite movie of all time.
5,...Great,"if you like the edgy sketch comedy of The Kids in The Hall, you will love there edgy film debue. This was a very funny movie for me and alot of my friends. This movie has some characters from the Tv show, such as the Taxi driver. This film is about a crazed doctor named Chris Cooper. He works for Don Roritor's company. The company fears money promblems and needs a back to school drug. Mr.Roritor interviews many Doctors such as the Worm Pill Scientist, and the Stummies Scientists. All of those ideas sound terrible so Don chooses Christopher Cooper's idea for an anti-depressent. Soon the drug begins to take over everybodies life (And beats Penicillin). Then the early test subjects (Who were rushed) begin to slip into commas, what happends next.. buy the movie."
3,Watch the Show First!,"I saw this movie for the first time before I had seen the show. I have to admit i was really creeped out. I watched some of the shows, and viewed this movie again, and it was like, ohh, I get it now. This movie has it's moments, and very funny ones I might add. So if you're a Kids in the Hall fan, this movie is a must for your collection, if you're just wanting to find out what the Kids are all about, watch the tv show first!"
5,"Gleemenex to the rescue, a cult classic film, the monty python group of the late 80's/early 90's, check it out, or ""I crush you""","Kids in the hall was a series that ran for a few years on HBO, then was syndicated on late night local tv stations and eventually made it into rotation on comedy central, where it did very well and got a cult following. Well riding a wave of popularity, they released this film ""brain candy"" to the big screen, Not a box office blockbuster, but not a flop, and definitely picking up cult status when released on DVD. All the main characters are the gang from the show, and they continue the comedy antics like they always did on the small screen. Many people find this movie just goofy, but I think its a definite one for the collection, just for some of its sterotypes, and underlying it all is a little bit of commentary on what current society is today...just taken to a hillarious extreem, check it out."
5,A must see for everyone in the pharma industry...,I think this comedy is a hilariuosly accurate picture of the pharmaceutical industry. Brings humor to pharm development while presenting the pressures and struggles of its success.
5,The comedy that defines the '90's.,"The undefinable 1990's is defined in this wonderful film. This light ""dark comedy"" outlined the blurry boundaries of the decade that refused to be pinned down.In my opinion, this is, hands down, the best comedy of the 1990's. I defy you to come up with a better comedy from this decade. THANK YOU FOR FINALLY RELEASING THIS ON DVD."
5,what more could you expect!,"Great movie! I was kinda reluctant to watch it at first cause i read all these bad reviews on it, but I LOVED it! All you people that wrote all those bad things about it, honestly, what more could you expect? If you love the show then you will love this movie! The movie is much like the show; some parts you laugh out loud, some you chuckle, and some parts are so bizzare you just stare in horror...and then laugh. In short, it is worth watching! Bravo to the kids!"
5,This movie was the best,I probably think that way because I am in love with the Queen of Comedy Scott Thompson.
2,Letdown,"As a massive Kids in the Hall fan, I must admit that I found this movie to be a crushing disappointment. It isn't just that so few of the KITH characters from their wonderful TV show are missing (though this is one significant obstacle) but also that the premise of this movie (a very good one I might add) ultimately comes across as just a little half baked. There are some funny moments here, but those unfamiliar with the Kids' brand of sketch humor would do best to stick with videos of their television show."
5,I was alone in the theater on opening weekend.,This movie is pure genius and I am happy to finally have a copy on DVD. If you know anything about it you really should consider picking one up.
1,Mine was defective,"It dispensed huge chunks of pepper no matter how much or little I tightened the screw on top. Maybe others got lucky, but I did read that someone else shared the same issue as I. I'm returning it for a refund and will not recommend it, unless I'm assured by William Bounds that mine was a lemon."
1,"Looks beautiful, works terribly","I was looking for a not too expensive pepper mill. It does look beautiful, but hardly any pepper comes out of it. Does not do the job, don't waste your money."
1,Worst pepper mill ever.,"This is the worst pepper mill ever created.There is no ""adjustment"" for the mill. Tightening the screw at the top does nothing. The cheap plastic mills at the grocery store produce a more consistent grind than this piece of trash.My recommendation is to use your money more wisely and invest in a Peugeot mill."
2,Not too great,These dont really work all that well. Wouldnt recommend for high volume restaurant. maybe for your own kitchen. Not too satisfied.
2,Poor Quality Mill,"I have been really disappointed with this mill. I bought it to get a larger grinder (my previous grinder was a 3"" Peugot). The William Bounds is not reliable, has an incredibly slow output - it's disappointing. I'm upset that I spent $20 on something that is worth $10 at best. And this last weekend, it broke when I tried to tighten the grinder- it's also poorly constructed.Go to Penzey's Spices and get one of their pepper mills, it's the best I've ever used (this is clearly what I should have bought). Or buy a Peugot. But this product is pretty bad."
1,"It's dead, Jim","I have had this scale for about 4 months. It worked fine the few times I used it, but last night I went to use it and it has given up the ghost. I swapped batteries and still nothing. The connection for the 9v battery is VERY loose, and even after crimping and holding it tight it didn't get any juice. Not happy so I will order a different brand and hope it does better. I do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets, so maybe I just got a lemon."
1,Dysfunctional,Sent it back. Couldn't see the read-out with a plate or saucer on the scale. Needs a tilted or canted face.
3,Scale Okay,"I purchased this scale January 24, 2007 for $30.00. It was used mostly for measuring bread baking ingredients on an average of 4 times each month. Around 3 months ago it intermittently would not turn on. Today it finally died. So, this scale lasted almost 3 years. Up until it started to malfunction I had no complaints but I wish it lasted longer especially in light of a low average monthly use. Today I purchased a new scale and it was not a Polder."
4,You'll enjoy Helen Bergan's stories,"There's so much to like about this book: an autobiographical travelog of the late 1960s without self-aggrandizing, and with insightful reflections about the people she encountered and the places she visited. The recipes she collected along the way add special ""flavor"" to be book, a real bonus."
5,Great Review Book,This High Yield book is better then most of the books in the High Yield series. It has a clear and quick reading format but is not simply a long outline. It got me through 1st and 2nd year psych courses in med school. Great for Step1 too!
4,Great Information... Questionable Photos,"Let me start by saying I teach 5th grade. I was looking for materials to use in my classroom during a continent study of South America. I came across this book and thought it would be great to share with my class when we got to Brazil. The book is very creative and exciting and is a great resource of information. However, there are pictures of young Yanomami boys and girls, nude. I know this is a part of their culture, but it made the book difficult to use in a school setting. So I am just putting that out there for any other teacher (or parent) to consider, considering that this is listed as a children's book."
4,311 Transistor....not for everyone....but awesome !,"While most 311 fans aren't ""Down"" with some of the tracks which appear on the cd Transistor, they are amazed all the same. 311 took a short time to slap all these tracks on to one cd, and many fans weren't impressed. Others were, and ""Transistor"" opened up many doors to new fans. ""Gap"" is an old school track on this import and is so amazing, but the other highlights of this album are the mellow ""Light Years"", a song that can just make you think of where you stand in the world. Songs like ""Starshines"" and ""Jupiter"", are mega great! This album is a worthwhile purchase! For sure! The popular track is called ""Transisor"", and if you enjoy that track, you are in for a treat. Be sure to check out the mystery track at the beginning of the CD. :)"
5,One of the Best,"Real 311 fans will love this album. People are complaining that this album is too soft or too weird the fact is that 311 will remain true to themselves, the fans, and any other lovers of true music."
3,Yawn II,Yippe. Another compilation album that slightly reshuffles the track assortment from its American counterpart - Why?
2,Must Read Before Buying,"This coffee maker was great for about 6 months. After that the grinder stopped working properly and the filter got jammed so the coffee couldn't go through to the pot. I tried everything to fix it, but it still won't work properly. The coffee tastes great when it is new, but this coffee maker doesn't last long until it breaks down."
4,Best grind and brew ever,"I had Cafe-San (Sanyo). I've used Cuisinart. This one's much better. I have an older one that's why only 4 stars. The newer ones have upgrades I would have wanted and I'd give them 4.5 stars because of that. With more lattitude in brew strength and number of cups it'd be a 5. The burr grinder is better than the propellers. If you use paper filters there is only 1 part to clean besides the pot. Unlike the others there is no mess of wetted ground up beans anywhere except in the paper (or gold screen) filter.The taste is as good as any fresh ground coffee, but if you leave the beans in the holder for too long they can get stale. (I keep them in the freezer).Service when I lost a piece down the drain was impeccable. Even though I bought a factory refurbished one in the now extinct Lechter's for a mere ... the full warranty was honored."
5,The Best of the Best,"I checked out many coffee grinder/brewers and this one TOPS THE LIST. It is extremely easy to use and clean. The other brands require you to clean and dry before you can use them again.I had company and made breakfast for them the next morning. My company loved the coffee that it brewed so much that I made 3 pots one after the other without having to dry all the parts like the Krups. (I purchased the Krups and sent it back because it was too complicated with all the cleaning, drying, etc.) They too liked this coffee maker, so much so that they where going to buy one for themselves.We all agreed that it makes the best coffee and it's not complicated to use. It's easy to program for the next morning and delightful to wake up to the smell of FRESHLY brewed coffee. You will be VERY HAPPY to own this coffee grinder/brewer. THE PLUS is that it is the most quite of all grinders and it grinds quickly. Hurry and buy one while they last......A SATISFIED OWNER!"
5,My Favorite Alarm Clock,"It's 6:30 a.m. and the sound of the beans grinding precedes the aroma of the ground beans brewing . . . what a great way to greet the day! The Capresso -- my favorite alarm clock -- is also my favorite appliance of any type because it works and works well. The beans are ground to perfection, the brewing is precise, and the end result is the best cup of coffee anywhere. I value my first, second and subsequent cups of coffee. They make my day. If this machine were a film, I'd give it two thumbs way up!"
2,Unreliable,"I loved my Capresso grind and brew for the first six months. Afterwards the unit stopped brewing. The grinder works, but the coffee would not brew and the heat plate did not warm up. Capresso sent me a UPS tag to send in the unit for repair. After receiving the unit back, it worked for three days and then stopped brewing again. I called Capresso back and they are sending me a new unit. I can't complain about Capresso standing behind their product, however I'm anticipating more problems. I'm also concerned that the replacement unit will have problems after the warranty expires."
3,"Good coffee maker, poor seller","I bought this coffee maker knowing it was a refirbished model. However, it did not work when I got it. It would grind the beans, but no water would go through the system to make the coffee. I wrote to the seller, who told me to contact Capresso. The folks at Capresso guarantee their machine's so they sent me a another machine. They also informed me they no longer make these older models, but they found one in their warehouse. So basically I am unsure of what really went on here - Does Coffee Team sell machines that do not work, and then refer their dissatisfied customers to get replacements from the manufacturer Capresso? That is what happened in my case. I did get a machine that does work, and it makes excellent coffee. Hats off to Capresso for standing behind their merchandise."
3,Great Machine - But not for long,"I've just bought my third. Obviously my wife and I like it. All the features and praises in the other reviews I totally agree with. But don't plan on it lasting more than 2 or 3 years at the most.We only make one pot of coffee a day. We keep it cleaned per the instructions. Regardless, after 2 years it starts wearing out. The grinder starts making funny noises, then the ""swing"" mechanism for the ground coffee starts to jam.So, if you want a great cup of coffee, and are willing to pay about $100 a year for a coffeemaker. This is for you"
1,Broken Again,"Well, it happened for the second time. After receiving my second replacement from Capresso, the coffee brewed successfully for only one day. Capresso has told me that their policy is not to refund money. They have offered me a third replacement which I declined. This has been a complete waste of my time and money. Believe me, the bad reviews you are reading are true. Don't take your chances."
4,Great coffee Maker,"I bought this item for christmas. It has worked great. The video that came with the product helped make the item easy to setup and use. The coffee taste is great, and the timer for the grinder and coffee has worked perfectly. There are moving parts (filter and top of water storage, so if you are doing coffee you have to remember to have everything in place. Cleaning has been no problem, I love the gold filter, nomore paper filters. Price was higher than other makers but they don't do what this one does."
5,Search no more!,"Convenience is why this grind and brew is the one and only. I owned the others, and cleaning was a pain. The difference with the Capresso, is the separation of the grind and the brew. The large capacity bean container allows you to brew 30 cups of coffee. The others, only one pot and after each, you must clean the grind area because of the steam created during the brewing process. The design of the Capresso, grinds the beans separate from the steam created from the brewing. No cleaning! Next pot requires only the removal of old grounds, adding water and your done. You will pay more for this machine, but it's worth every dollar, for this pain free, time saving convenience."
2,Disappointed after one year,"Like many of the reviewers who recently bought this machine and wrote that they loved it, we really liked ours . . . at first. But just weeks after the one-year warranty expired, the electronics failed. You can't brew coffee if you can't set the number of cups you want brewed, etc. For the cost -- it's mostly plastic, after all -- we'd hoped this would last longer."
2,"This coffeemaker is a real ""drip""","I bought two of these coffeemakers due to different morning schedules in my family. BOTH of them drip water all over the counter. I've tried ordering parts but to no avail.I applaud the concept but a fix is desperately needed. Just read others reviews and you'll see the consistency of the same leaking problem. Again, good concept but bad investment!"
1,flimsy piece of crud,This thing broke fast. The cheap plastic latch that the brew basket swings on broke after a couple months. This thing is very poorly made. Save yourself the trouble guys/
3,"If you *must* have strong coffee, this is not your machine","This is a very good coffee maker, no doubt about it. However, the way that the coffee maker is set up with only a limited number of coffee strength options, this machine set at the strongest option only makes medium strength coffee. It's a shame. They should have an adjustement for longer grind time, but they don't. You can play around with putting only 8 cups of water in the machine and set the brew to 10 cups, but then it is still only moderately strong and you have only about 4 cups of coffee (who really thinks that 10 cups from a coffee maker is 10 cups of coffee?). For the price of this machine, I shouldn't have to play around with the machine so much in order to get a semi-strong cup of coffee. And knowing how my European friends drink coffee, I can't imagine that this machine sells well at all in Europe. My neighbors from Sweden won't drink my coffee from this machine. They call it ""Tea""."
2,Grider problems,Have had erratic grinding time problems. Sometimes it will grind for the right amount of water other times it keeps running and will grind all the coffee. I now grind my coffee in another grinder and use the pot manually.
4,Canon personal copier PC170,"Excellent product for home use! Setting up was easy, uses small amount of desk place!We have made 100 copies now and have had no problems!"
5,Good starter copier,"This is not something you would use for a business, it copies slow and does not feed multiple documents. Slooow but it can copy."
1,Defective product,"I purchased this item for my Mother. Had it sent to Rhinelander, WI. She was very upset that it didn't work. I contacted Adorama Camera and they stated she should return it for a replacement. That's been a week and a half ago. She has not yet received the replacement product. So as of this moment I am unhappy with the whole purchase."
2,False advertising.,I will be returning this item. It was advertised as a portabe /travel copier. I weighs a tonand is not able to be connected to a computer. Really not suited to my needs.
3,"Need to constantly change settings, but decent copies","My PC170 made copies that were very light right from day one, but have deteriorated progressively ever since. Basically, they are useless now, they are so light; I've been using the copier about 3 months. I changed cartridges but this has not helped. Now, I'm waiting to hear back from tech support. Pretty irritating.After receiving an e-mail from Canon, the solution is very simple. However, I need to change the settings frequently depending on the darkness of the original. Often, this is known only after making the copies the first time."
4,My backup,"This copier (Canon PC 170) is very convenient for my purposes, and for last month (since I bought it) it has worked without any problem.I needed it for making copies of documents, which I review, and prepare for a submission.It makes good copies, and when I need enlargement or a decrease, I go to a near-by place, butit happens very infrequently.It is portable, small, not heavy, and If I need to take it with me to another place, it would beno problem to carry it. The only thing I am not sure yet, is - how many copies I can make withone tank of ink ?"
2,Not so good,"I will not place an order like this again through Amazon. There seems to be no recourse if there is a problem. This copier was ordered from ""Adorama Camera""in New York City through the Amazon site. Unfortunately, upon installation it became apparent that the toner cartridge was defective. The customer rep at Adorama said that the copier was ""dropped"" to us from a distributor and referred me to Canon for service, but Canon said that they would not help because Adorama was not a Canon dealer. Now, over one month after the original order, I am still waiting for a promised replacement from Adorama."
4,canon pc 170 personal copier,"I bought this several months ago - it's so easy to set up and use - a bit heavy to ""carry around"" but you can take it with you if needed. I'm glad I got it."
4,Almost perfect,"The product was one of the lowest prices on Amazon, it was delivered on time and replaced an old (25 years) Cannon personal copier. The cost of a new cartridge for the old one was almost the same price as the new one that came with a cartridge. Pros- Starts immediately, no warm up and is quick, controls are a little better than the old copier. Cons- unit was a little louder than old unit and I didn't like the circular Cannon logo in the middle of the top platter as it prevents the surface from being used to work on it.Great value for money.Graham"
3,The jury is still out.,It did not make one great copy. The question is - do I spend over $100.00 to buy toner in hopes that I will then be satisfied.
1,I wish I hadn't read it!,"I won't tell you how this book ends, but I was totally depressed by it! There wasn't an ending! I put the book down and was disgusted. One of the books, though I did enjoy while reading, I wish I hadn't ever picked up."
4,OPI Avojuice,Avojuice is hydrating not greasy. Coconut melon Juicie is a soft scent of coconut. Leaves the skin soft to the touch. Great after a shower or anytime of the day.
5,Love it!,This is the best lotion to make your hands feel silky smooth! Ever since I had a manicure and she used these on my hands I have been in love! I highly recommend it!
4,Relevant,Listen to this and you will appreciate it! You'll hear the originals to so many songs that you hear today. Only Eric Clapton has given this guy his due. Buy it...it's great and you'll be a little cooler.

3,It's All About Robbie...,"Although I'm a big fan of just about everyone who had anything to do with making this film (on both sides of the lens), I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. Actually more irritated than anything else. Too much Robbie Robertson. His face is in every shot and he hogs the commentary footage. The Last Waltz is by and about THE BAND (amazon.com can't even get it right in their listing of the DVD). Robbie Robertson was just one member of The Band. Indeed, one only has to watch the film to realize that on the ""heart and soul"" scale (and that's what this band was about) Robertson (as cool and articulate as he is) brings up the rear. It's obvious that Robbie Robertson and Martin Scorsese were tight on a movie producer level and it's a drag that they were led by their egos into the editing room. If you can get past all that, there are some tear-jerkingly awesome performances."
5,Great Movie!,"Wow....Is all I REALLY have to say...I'd NEVER heard ANY music by ""The Band"" before; not that I was aware of anyways...But I was HIGHLY impressed...I would have DIED to have been at that concert!!! But I wasn't born for another 9yrs after that concert was performed and filmed(In 1976). I've *always* treasured older music. And their music is just *awesome*!! The camera work was nice and the picture quality is *GREAT*!!! It certainly was a wonderfull introduction to not ONLY ""The Band"", but other people like: Muddy Waters(Whom influenced a GREAT MANY 60's groups like: The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, ect.), Van Morrison, Joni Mitchel, Neil Young, Neil Diamond,Eric Clapton, as well as other legends and greats of the era!!! :)I was drove to tears by some of the songs and performances. It IS that GOOD! Trust me.Worth watching NO DOUBT!!!*Enjoy*God Bless ~Amy"
5,The Last Waltz Dances with the Stars,"The Last Waltz is truly a spectacular video that represented a time and place in music history that probably can never be achieved again. The performers who appeared with The Band will certainly fill a complete wing in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Martin Scorcese's interviews, creative camera locations, and beautiful set provided the backdrop for a farewell tribute to one of the most professional bands ever assembled. No reunion tours here, this was truly ""The Last Waltz"". From Dr. John to Neil Young to Bob Dylan the list goes on and on. If you loved the late 60's and early 70's, this is the DVD for you."
4,Rocking!,"I have to admit that before seeing this movie, I wasn't a big fan of the Band, but their performance on this particular night really rocked. Kudos to Martin Scorsese for bringing us closer to the intimacy of the group in live performance. This intimacy is only hightened by the fact that the director seems to have made a concerted effort not to film the audience. There are also some wonderful performances by other musicians such as Joni Mitchell and Muddy Waters.I have to say though that Bob Dylan had to be the worst performer on the night and I was glad when everybody else got up there to help him out.Apparently when Scorsese showed the initial cut to Neil Young's manager he was furious as Neil had a huge cocaine booger hanging from his nostril. Somehow Scorsese managed to cover it up."
5,GREATEST ROCK CONCERT EVER,I'm 30 years old and grew up in an age of terrible music and without any role models that exposed me to any classic rock I fell into the world of pop :..( A friend of mine showed me this movie when I was in high school and it changed my life. This is compulation of the greatest musicians of all time which alot of them are still relevent today which doesn't happen anymore. I've bought this for about a dozen of people and all have thanked me. I would give this 20 stars if I could.
5,Best Music DVD Until Proven Otherwise,"The best music DVD out there ,still . Includes probably the best versions of some of the greatest songs ever recorded. Among them : Helpless - Neil Young , Further On Up the Road - Eric Clapton , Caravan - Van Morrison , It Makes No Difference - Rick Danko , The Weight - The Band with The Staples , The Night They Drove Ol' Dixie Down - Levon Helm , Mystery Train - Paul Butterfield , Such A Night - Dr. John , Ophelia ...Would like to hear more of The Band ( Some great songs are missing ) but I guess when you are spoiled by the performances listed above , you look for more of the same ."
3,Mixed Mix,"I guess they spent all their remastering money on the surround sound because the standard stereo mix is about the worst I've ever heard from a modern movie. It's ragged and uneven in volume and the EQ often gets muddy. If you don't have surround, don't expect too much."
5,Great Rock Concert plus,"Probably one of the greatest rock concert videos ever. I would recommend, however, that you get This Wheel's on Fire by Levonm Helm as an insider accompnyment."
4,The Last Waltz,"Since I have worn out my VHS copy of this film, I was attempting to get a hold of a DVD copy, only to find that it is not available yet. Obviously, since the film was shot in 1976, the sound quality is not up to the pristine standards of the 21st century (hopefully some digital re-mastering will add some enhanced stereo spread). I was amazed at The Band's ability to seamlessly adapt to each new guest artist's style, while still adhering to their own sound (witness Robbie's lightning takeover of Eric Clapton's solo in ""Further On Up The Road"" when his guitar strap breaks on stage!) The breadth of talent of the artists presented for this concert has yet to be duplicated on ANY concert film, as far as I'm concerned. Neil Young was obviously having the musical time of his life! (pharmaceuticals notwithstanding) All in all, a thoroughly mesmerising film, with the music always taking priority. We miss you, Danko!"
5,A hard to find gem.,"The fact that this beautiful film is not available at most big chain video rental stores or libraries, is disturbing and really quite silly. Today's high school senior would love this film and it is a late night, post party rock and roll history lesson. Play it loud!"
4,ALL SONGS ARE GREAT!,"The grat director Scorcese filmed this documentary featuring The Band in interviews and shows. The Band plays happily their farewell show. Many famous artists join the Band on stage and play one song each with enthusiasm. There is a lot of the best of the 70's music; not disco-dancin', but folk, blues and rock'n'roll music - all songs are marvellous! Scorcese is a little too conventional in the shooting, not as creative as he normaly is, but does his job with perfection: the cameras are always on the right image, taking the viewer into the stage. The ending is symbolic: The Band plays a waltz while the camera zooms out- a touch of Scorcese style."
4,"Scorcese Sharp, Band Bright",The movie is great in hi-def. The images look fantastic and the sounds is great. Issue with the extra interviews - there is a bright green line on the right side of the picture frame which is annoying.
2,Fake Widescreen,"Compare the picture on this DVD to the picture in the VHS tape that we all know and love. You'll find that with this ""letterbox"" version, the black bars COVER UP the top and bottom of the original picture!!! You are NOT seeing more (as you are normally supposed to with letterbox), you are seeing LESS of ""The Last Waltz"" than ever before. A/B them and see for yourself...."
3,Not bad for a fiver,"I got this DVD at my brother's recommendation for a fiver in Heathrow Airport, and it was good value at that. Good American music and a very well shot concert movie (well, it is Scorsese!) The interview sequences are intersting and as a Chaucer fan I delighted at the intro to the Canterbury Tales being read out. I was unfamiliar with the group's music before seeing this, and whilst they aren't a patch on Creedence Clearwater Revival I still admire their music. An interesting insight to a little segment of rock history."
1,"NO dts-HD at all, instead of what the back cover stated","Audio options didn't provide dts-HD, or even other lossless formats.[...]But how dare the specification stated so???[...]Indeed the sound presented in PCM wasn't that bad (but was when in Dolby 5.1). But why MGM lie? I feel so bad as it's just like a scam."
5,The Last Waltz very worth it!,My order of The Last Waltz DVD arrived promptly at my door in excellent condition. I am very satified.
5,A Great 1970's Music Moment,When I saw The Last Waltz I knew it was for a moment in time which would never come back. The artists were so special and so good and now some are no longer with us. I loved Joanie Mitchell's number and the Band's many numbers as well as Van Morrison's number. Robbie Robertson was so good looking.
3,Blue Ray? HD?,"I already have a dvd in my collection for this excellent concert.I purchased the blue-ray version expecting superior quality in picture and sound.No deal. Simply take a look of the interview of Robbie Robertson by Scorsese andyou'll find there's no difference with the regular version of dvd.Why bother, I mean the folks who put this blue-ray together?"
5,I defy you to watch this without tapping your feet,"The first tunes on this disc are just mesmerizing and catchy as all get out, so much so that I just had to jump up and type this review! The sound is unbelievably good for something so old. It blows away ""Rock of Ages"" in terms of clarity and balance. Somehow it has been balanced so you can hear each voice and instrument-and I'm only running two channels at the moment, to boot. I could blab on about all kinds of extra material (except for a choice of stereo vs. Dolby etc which I don't see anywhere) but I won't. Just get it and enjoy."
4,DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS,THE LAST WALTZ. WHAT CAN I SAY BUT STAR STUDDED. TO HAVE ALL OF THESE GREAT MUSICIANS ON ONE STAGE IS AWSOME.THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS WAS AT THE MOVIE THEATER IN ITS FIRST RUN. IT IS A TIMELESS CLASSIC. WELL WORTH THE PRICE: ESPECIALLY WHAT YOU WOULD PAY TO SEE THESE GIANTS OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY TODAY-$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$-GREG S.
5,The Last Waltz,"This is the one of the most entertaining and informative concerts I have experienced. The music was awesome, and the production and direction superb. A DVD that everyone who loves music should not miss."
3,"Pretty Good Music, But [unreal]","Robbie Robertson got this move made to glorify his own massive ego. As you can see from the footage, he interrupted almost every time another member of The Band had something to say -- God forbid someone else should take the spotlight away from him. The rest of The Band look pretty miserable during the proceedings, as they knew the whole thing was a disgraceful and [unreal] sham.This was NOT a major concert event, although the movie would have you believe it was history in the making. The Band had been on a downward spiral for years and Robertson's contention that they had had enough of the road is laughable; they weren't playing many gigs at this point, not like the old days anyway when they were criss-crossing North America on a series of one-night stands.As for the music, it's pretty fair. But the only truly great performance is Van Morrison's. He blew everyone off the stage that night."
3,Replacement,Actually this is a replacement for a defective DVD of The Last Waltz that I received. As far as returning the defective item it was relatively easy to return it and was done in a timely manner. I also received the replacement DVD in a timely manner. No complaints at all with this company.
3,Where's tura Lura ?,"With all the wasted footage on his highness (snicker) Mr.Robertswhatever, and the likes of Kneel Diedman for cryin' out loud, why couldn't Mr Scorch-cheesy fit in the Richard Manuel/Van morrison duet on Tura-Lura? What a freakin' faux pas!! Does anyone know where footage of that little gem can be found?"
3,Robbie Robertson,"To read the publicity surrounding the DVD release of ""The Last Waltz,"" you'd think Robbie Robertson rose to fame as a solo act. Certainly director Martin Scorcese has helped create this impression: Throughout the movie, the lighting is always brighter on Robertson than on anyone else on screen -- even though Robertson doesn't sing a word. I guess it's his pretty red scarf that catches the camera's eye. Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson? Oh yeah, those guys. They're in the movie, not that Robertson or Scorcese seemed to notice. But this film is not a documentary about The Band; it's more like Robbie Robertson's application for movie stardom. Needless to say, Robbie's name never became a household word with the Photoplay crowd. As for the interviews: Robertson sounds like one of those tedious oldtimers at the VFW trying to impress you with stories about how rough it was in the old days. What a bore!"
2,great dvd,GREAT DVD content but the problem is it skips and have not heard back from the company yet when I complained
5,adult material,"Too much is revealed in interview portions.Music unequaled! I will buy another, but can not recommend the disc for everyone. thanks...."
2,Boring,I didn't like the music. Didn't like the movie. Boring. Liked some of the artists (Van M. & Ringo). I paged through the chapters. Had no interest at all in what these guys were saying while smoking and they all looked kind of depressing.
5,E' grande,"E' grande, un bellissimo quadro di quel nuovo Dylan, una band davvero in forma, un evento storicizzato da un bravo e attento direttore. Non può mancare nella nostra collezione."
3,Not Bad,"I read Levon Helm's book on The Band. There were major problems with the filming of this concert. Nearly all of the music had to be redone by the performers and it shows. Watch the musicians hands and you'll cleary see that they don't match with what you're hearing. It still sounds pretty good though. It is worth seeing. But the new 5.1 mix is a bit annoying. It moves around too much and vocals seem to change in volume. I LOVE The Band. I have all of their CDs. It's a shame that the concert was so shabbily done, thanks to all of the drugs consumed by everyone involved. Still, it's an enjoyable film."
3,It only took six measures,"Six measures into the first tune, ""Don't Do It,"" I knew they'd blown it with this release. As a fan of the movie for years, I wore out my videocassette copy, and grabbed the Special Edition DVD.They've remixed the audio! When I first saw the film, I was completely blown away by the power of Rick Danko's bass, walking into the section of ""Don't Do It,"" just before the guitar enters. On this release, it's gone! It's like they muted the bass channel in the remix. Thanks for ruining it for me, MGM. If you love the music, try to get an older video release. The mix is the way it should be. And what's with the graphic design? Did anyone use a Telecaster in the whole concert? Not that I can recall."
5,Wonderful,This is an excellent view of The Band. Excellent quality and The Band never sounded better. Kind of bittersweet to look back on a wonderful experience and know it can never be repeated. Very much worth adding to your DVD collection.
5,My 1 DVD for a Desert Island,"This is simply the FINEST music documentary ever!When I first got the album in 1978, it was one of the few ones that I actually wore out from playing. I have seen it well over 100 times and it is still as fresh as when I first saw it in 1978. Although it is over 25 years old and much of the music is almost 40 years old it still sounds great. Sorsese pioneer documentaries with this. The interviews are still funny and sad. The performances are on target. To really get a whole view of The Band after watching this, get Levon Helm's ""This Wheel's On Fire"". Too bad they lost Richard Manuel and Rick Danko-both great musicians. Show this to your kids or grand kids to let them see great music before it was a commercial product."
2,I Don't Get The Hype,"This is a dreary and depressing DVD. I have tried to watch it several times with an open mind and I still can't understand why it has such a high rating. The performances are mostly too laid back. In my opinion, this is what was wrong with most music from that era."
1,You better like this band.,"I read the reviews and bought this based on that it was a behind the scenes band interaction and then some of their concert. The bulk of it was their concert and songs - which I didn't care for and the movie was so boring, I got halfway through and stopped watching. Unless you are a fan of this band, and want concert footage, this isn't worth watching."
2,An Ancient Relic,This looks like an ancient relic relative to new concert DVD's. This is a rental only. This is not one of those concerts I would watch a second time and skipped thru much of it.
5,A top choice,"After forty years, I discovered ""The Band."" What a delight!I remember references to their name, but did not realize that is what they called themselves. I remember one or two of the songs that made it on the radio in the sixties. At that time, I was totally into the Fab Four (John, Paul, Ringo and George).These gentlemen are accomplished musicians. I enjoyed their ""story songs"" and how they meld varied styles, e.g., rhythm and blues, country, rock, and rock and roll to name a few, into super sounds and words. Most touching, however, is the palpable feeling of connection between these gentleman and their polished ensemble playing and singing that Scorsese's filming and direction reveals.The sound is great, and this is one film that I will watch over and over again."
5,EXCELLENT!!,The item was in perfect condition and shipped even earlier than I expected!! GREAT SALE!
1,very disappointed,"Although I did not pay much for this DVD, I was very disappointed in it because it would not play. It really wasn't worth it to return it"
2,Presentation overshadows music,"I must say I'm not a huge fan of The Band, but I like ""Before the Flood"". However, I was amazed at how poorly The Band played, and sang even worse, in this, their farewell concert. It is hard to believe they had played together for 17 years.Even the guests, such as Bob Dylan, seemed to use their worst voice. Only Eric Clapton was really any good, though Van Morrison was acceptable. Otherwise, fairly embarrassing musical performances. At the end, *everybody* is onstage singing ""I Shall Be Released"" - killing an otherwise nice song.Obviously Scorsese got all the good film people and photographers to work on the project, and it was well done. So well done that the presentation outshines the music.There are some nice extras, including multiple commentaries. Hard to recommend it unless you are truly a Band fan."
2,"Borrow it, don't buy it","This ""movie"" has taken on a life of its own and for what reason I do not know. It is average performances by everyone involved except for Richard Manuel, Garth Hudson, Levon Helm and Rick Danko. Those four were the backbone to Robbie Robertson's spineless behavior, then and now. I personally would not put another dime in Robertson's pocket and anyone who believes he is a songwriter, a singer or a guitar player hasn't a clue as to what any of those things are so buying music is a waste of your time. After all, it was Robbie who stuck Neil Diamond into the mix that night. That should have been clue #1..."
2,Good...not GREAT,"Let's get something straight. The Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock movies are far superior concert films. This ""greatest concert film of all time"" hype was cooked up by the producers of this film and critics, the same bunch who are complicitus in fanning Michael Jackson's ego as the self-proclaimed ""King of Pop"".There are three great moments in the film:1)Neil Young2)Van Morrison3)The Band singing ""The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down""The rest of the film is a little too reverential for a band that had only two classic albums. For guys in their thirties, the band move and talk like weary seventy year olds. If they were so tired of ""the road"", why did they continue performing after this film was made. Get a real job like everyone else!The symphony additions and the cheesy trappings of the ""Last Waltz"" set up is a little too stuffy for a great bar band."
4,Great music & Musicians,I am at an age when some of the old rock and roll is the best. This movie has captured a lot of the magic in both the music and the performers who are tops in their field. It's starts out by saying turn up the volume and if you have a good sound system be sure you turn it up and prepare to rock.
4,Excellent film!!!,"The film start with a review of the own group about the begining and how they comes to make their carrers. The performances are very exciting and the sound is pretty good!. I recommended this film because you can see not only a traditional concert, but a film-documentary about great artist of the 60's, and of course, in 1979 they was still young, still on tour, so the performances are perfect!."
5,The Last Waltz DVD,Excellent documentary that will take you back in time with amazing musical highlights from The Band's last concert in 1978. Awesome!!!
3,"Loved the Band's Songs, But...","Yeah, I loved all of the songs which were originally written and recorded by The Band, but didn't care for the songs that their guests performed. I am surprised that this sentiment hasn't been stated more often. I wanted to hear more of The Band's music. I was expecting the guests to accompany them, not sing their own songs."
4,Neil Diamond,It was a star studded evening indeed. Some very intimate and memorable performances. Neil Diamond totally stole the show. Out of place? The only way Neil was out of place was that he blew everyone off the stage and gave everyone a glimpse of true rock & roll royalty.
4,surprised,the quality of the cd was very surprising to me.no scratches or sticks so far.it was very nice to see the band together again.
3,Not As Good As Expected,"A couple of years ago I purchased the same DVD, and the sound and Video Quality was far better than the last copy I received. I can't seem to find out if it's just a bad DVD or if the recording quality on the last one was poor."
5,One of the Greatest Bands of Our Time,"One of a kind BAND, The Band, One of a Kind Performance. Martin Scorsese deserved an Academy Award for just this."
5,"Amazing Country Music, Best Cd I have bought in a long time!","Wow! This guy is great! Country music never sounded so good!Thers a good mix of traditional country, as well as faster contemporary songs on this one. Mark has a voice that reminds me of Vince Gill, yet still has that unique country sound. Definately pick this one up, you won't regret it!*****"
3,EH,it was a nice little gift. But after about 5 uses of the fingernail clippers they were too dull to use again. a few of the things are cheap
1,Garbage,"I have this kit and I paid $10 for it and I would not buy it again given the opportunity. Everything inside is made poorly. The only item I actually use is the mirror. Horrible item for $10, let alone the $28 it's selling for on Amazon."
2,Caution,The nose clipper does not work to my expectations. Bottom line the nose clipper doesn't work at all & that is the whole reason i bought this product. Everything in the kit is ok.
4,Lovely journal,"This journal has such sentimental notations and it will be a wonderful keepsake for our new baby. The only reason I gave it 4 of 5 stars is because it needs to be spiral-bound...other than that, it is great."
2,A little disappointed,Buy this if you want to write out full page essays - not jot down little experiences.
3,great for true journal writers,"This is a nice journal, but what I was unhappy with is that it's just a journal, so if you are like me, and not a big writer, this isn't the one for you. I was expecting more of a fill-in type like a baby book, with some space for writing and pictures, but every page is just lined, with a heading, such as ""your name"". I can't fill a whole page with just stuff about a name! There are no specific spots for keeping up with weight gain, first movements, etc, you just have to write it essay style. She does give great sentence starters, though, to get your thoughts going. Also, there are no specific places for ultrasound or pregnant pictures. So, if you love to journal, this is the book for you, if not, keep looking!"
4,the book that covers alot of history,"If you have alot of time on your hands, this is the book for you! It asks you to write alot of history on you, the father, the grandparents, trends, prices of the day, thoughts.....This being my third child, I was used to the books that ask more about the pregnancy and day to day stuff, which it does, but not as much as I would of liked. Toward the end of the book it really concentrates on birth, after thoughts, more baby stuff.It is alot of work, but in the long run, very worth while for your child."
3,Could've been better,"It's a nice little journal with pretty pictures. It might be better though, if it were spiral bound, so it's easier to write on the pages. I would also suggest more blank pages for random thoughts."
3,Not too satisfied,"I thought this pregnancy journal was okay. It's great if you want to invest a ton of time writing details on how you met the father of the baby, about all your doctors appointments, what your future plans are for the baby, etc. There weren't really a lot of good spots to put pictures. And I'm a fan of pictures! So I just gave mine away to a friend who is newly expecting!"
5,"Thank you, Maestro!!","Here is the deal with this CD-single. First you need to know how to appreciate the already-too-popular-but-not-less-beautiful Pachelbel. Then you remember those Rachmaninovian recurrent themes in his piano concertos. After you have used all your classical music formation to analyze Pachelbel and Rachmaninoff's, leave them aside. Then turn on the CD player with Nanes' Adagio. This is better savored when you have those unbearable problems in the back of your mind. The elegant, soft, lyrical mood of the piano and that impecable curtain provided by the London Philarmonic's chords will make you fly high, over all your problems, and the misery of this world. This is one of my best classical CDs. Do you think this too new-agian, mood-seeking music? Well... yes, so what? It serves its purpose: it touches your soul."
2,Too Much Work Therefore Too Expensive,"The cards themselves are good because they are based on the excellent Wheelock text. They are numbered and also show the Chapter number in which the word was first introduced. However, you must separate them from the pages yourself and I found the perforations to be insufficient. I spent many hours getting them separated and making the two little boxes from the pages provided. All in all I would recommend against these and suggest you get a standard set of pre-made Latin flash cards from Vis-Ed or Sparks Notes and just remove the cards you need based on the Wheelock vocabulary. I can't imagine paying this much, doing all the work, and on top of that laminating the cards for an additional expense. You'll have more time to study Latin!"
4,"Mediocre quality, excellent tool","As other reviewers have noted, these ""cards"" have their drawbacks, the biggest of which is the poor quality of perforation. I use the perforation to pull the pages out, then a scissors to cut some of the cards. The cards themselves are a bit thin but then this is a single-purpose, probably single-use, product.Drawbacks aside, I found these cards invaluable. I just completed Latin 101 at the University of Oregon, and easily got an A for fall term, due in no small part to using these flashcards as a major component of my review and pre-test study time. In contrast, I found the Workbook for Wheelock's Latin to be comparatively useless.Once you start moving beyond Wheelock, the Vis-Ed flash cards (1000 per pack) are the next step. They're high quality, pre-cut and useful indefinitely."
2,Outrageous Price,"The price for these cards is outrageous.Do a comparison to a similar product put out by Zondervan. They publish Greek and Hebrew cards for their textbooks. The Basics of Biblical Greek cards are $15.29 for 1,000 cards (their Old Testament Biblical Hebrew cards are $12.22 for 1,000 cards). They are also clearly printed on a card stock that is superior to those of the Vocabulary Cards for Wheelock's Latin and they come in a sturdy attractive box.What makes this comparison so odd is that the Wheelock Grammar itself is sold at such a reasonable price. I hope that the publishers will simply choose to copy the approach taken by Zondervan. Providing pre-printed vocabulary cards is a good idea - but the publisher's execution of that idea does not build good will with its readers."
2,I Was Warned,"I read the two reviews available at the time, so I must say I was warned. I should have paid more attention to the ""Latin Student"" review about the poor quality. I will not repeat them all, but I concur on every point. The physical quality of this product is very, very low.The content of the product is a good idea. The publishers/editors should completely remake them and abandon the whole format that requires tearing apart cards and assembling flimsy boxes. They then should offer the new product at a very low price for those of us who wish to trade in this version."
1,Not a remote controled sailboat.,"This product was listed on an RC page. It's a wonderful modelsailboat that requires time, skill, and power tools to build. No RCequipment provided, of course, because it is just a lovely model."
3,One of Ringo's best albums (that may not be saying much),"If you like country music and are a Beatle fan, you should own this album. You wrap Ringo up with this album and his self-titled ""Ringo"" album."
3,Somebody Stepped On His Foot,"This is an interesting little LP, but don't be fooled into thinking it's great country music.Does Charlie Daniels play on the LP? Yes. Charlie Daniels played on everybody's records at the time, he was a fairly important studio musician.Does Ringo sing well? Relatively speaking. I'm a great Ringo fan, but to say he croons like George Jones is to ignore reality. Ringo croons like Ringo.Are these great country tunes? Hardly. Ringo was a fan of the syrupy country popular at the time, which had more to do with Glen Campbell and Donna Fargo than anything else.As much as I like Ringo--and I like Ringo a lot--I've always found this LP to be more of a curiosity than anything else.It's better than Keith Moon's solo stuff, but is that really a complement?"
1,Not worth a buffalo nickle,"I found this record at a used record store way back in 1978. Paid 50 cents for it. And if I ever see it at that price again, I'll spend my money on a soda instead. I'de critic each song for you if I could, and I have made many attempts to listen to these songs,but 10 seconds into every song is all I can take. Am I the only one who noticed that Ringo's singing sounds nervous and off key? How anyone can compare this album to the Eagles is beyond me. Buy ""Blast from the Past""or ""Ringo"" if your looking for post-Beatles Ringo Starr."
2,WAY to country,"For those of you who like country music, GET THIS ONE! I really don't like country music, so I have to rate it a 2. The only good song, is ""$15 Draw"" The rest is junk. I got it last Christmas, and have only listened to it ONCE. But for country fans, this is for you!"
4,Give it a chance,"I have to start off saying that unlike most people, I looked forward to getting this album and expected it to be really good. I have always thought that Ringo's voice would sound great for country (based on a few of the Beatles songs that he sang). I really do enjoy all of his albums but most of them are pretty goofy are really just great because of Ringo's sense of humor and energy, but this one is different. It is extremely good. Its simple, honest, and sincere. It has a really nice country feel to it but doesnt sound like a Beatle trying to do country, but in fact is really genuine and natural. Ringo's voice has never sounded better and the writers on the album penned some great and memorable songs. I dont like to pick each part of albums apart by rating each song, I think they are all very good, some better than others. Its not a ground breaking album and it probably wont change your life after you hear it, but it is, in my opinion, Ringo at his best, no matter what that means."
3,"When you're hot, you're hot","Ringo's second album was a country album. Unlike every other country album recorded by a rock star, this album doesn't feature any cover versions of classic country songs. Instead, a batch of original songs were written for Ringo by some top country songwriters. Ringo traveled to Nashville and recorded the album with top Nashville session musicians. The album ended up sounding pretty much like a typical country album from 1970. Except sung by Ringo Starr. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's a decent enough album, if you are into this sort of thing. The CD features two bonus tracks. ""Coochy Coochy"" was the b-side of ""Beaucoups of Blues"". I guess it was left off the album because it's not really a country song. ""Nashville Jam"" is a jam session, obviously. This album isn't for everybody, but if you are a Beatles fan that also enjoys country music, you will probably like it."
3,Better Than You Think!,"When I first bought this record in 1971, I was really let down because I wanted something like ""It Don't Come Easy"". This record is not rock, but it is fantastic country! Ringo is backed by some first-rate musicians and songwriters who do a fine job. Worth it!"
3,My favorite Ringo,"This is my favorite Ringo album. I've always liked his country tinged Beatle songs such as Don't Pass Me By, Act Naturally, and What Goes On. His mellow voice and heart on his sleeve demeanor are well suited for sad country songs of heart-breaking women, and this album is well done with good songs and lyrics, and musicianship. In my opinion this album is a nice addition to the Beatle catalog and makes for a nice set with other Beatle efforts from 1970: McCartney, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and All Things Must Pass."
3,same songs,"this product is cute at first. my son likes it, but it plays the same songs over on different tracks."
4,Good video,"Like the other Baby Signing Time videos, this one is a winner for my daughter. However, I'm a bit disappointed with it. I assumed it would be mainly about pottying and potty training, it really isn't."
5,It works!,"My daughter is 2 and a half now and was ready to start potty training. Since she loves music (and dancing) we got this DVD. The routine was...wake up, sit on her potty chair in front of the DVD while drinking juice and eating waffles or crackers until she produced pee. This started the day off with a success! She was so proud of herself. Once we learned the songs, we sang them through the day together. It created a happy, light, non-pressure environment. I like the clips of families hugging and encouraging their children on the DVD. The music CD is a good bonus also. My daughter did not like the watch, but that is fine."
3,My boys were into it for a little while.,"My son loved to use the watch/\. He was 3 1/2 when I tried it. His friends loved it. Not sure if after awhile he was made fun because he stopped wearing it. Next I need to try this on my 2 1/2. BTW my now 4 yr old son not potty trained. This watch has lasted though and heard the rest of the watches break easily. Its nice because you could time to go off every 30 min, 60 min, or 90. Being older I used 90 minutes."
5,singer721,"Don't let the grotesquely trite picture on the cover fool you, this is a book of extraordinary depth, with several artistically woven subplots. The book draws heavily on Jewish Mysticism and European Jewish history, superimposed on a modern setting. It is an absolutely riveting piece of work, and I eagerly await Henry Hocherman's next masterpiece!"
3,Not Bad,"My Techshell arrived on the exact day it was supposed to, two weeks after I ordered it. I was hoping it would arrive a little earlier but oh well. When it finally arrived, the plastic sleeve it was in was very dusty; it looked as though it had been lying in a warehouse for months, but don't worry the actual cover itself was unharmed after removing the plastic sleeve. When you attach it to your MacBook it leaves a few air bubbles that make it seem as though there is a few water puddles under the case. Other then that the Techshell provides good solid protection fits perfect and is only a little bit bulkier then just a plain un-protected MacBook. It scratches fairly easy but rather that then your MacBook... right?"
1,STUPID SAT PREP,"This book is just dumb. It only gives you 200 practice problems in a 200 page book. In addition, it DOES NOT include a practice test. the book costs you 15 dollars in a bookstore. As one of the owners of the book, i strongly recommend you to buy something else."
2,Horrible examples...,"This book has horrible vocabulary examples (you know, the example that accompanies the vocab). For instance, an example for the word ""wry"" which means ""dryly humorous"" was ""if she is dryly humorous, then she is wry"". How stupid is that? There were tons of other examples that were just like that. Plus, the book doesn't really teach you how to score higher. It teaches you how to gamble with your score. I definately do not recommend this book!"
1,Awful SAT Prep,This is useless book. Buying it is a waste of money. Most of its context is useless. The book does not give u sufficient strategies to tackle sat I verbal problems. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!
5,wonderful resource for early primary grades,"While looking for a book to teach math concepts to my VERY kinesthetic 5 year old, I came across Matharts and it is a wonderful find. The concepts are solid, the activities are fun, the materials are easy to find and the mess factor is fairly low. I do think that the age range (3-6) may be a little low - the older childre I've worked with enjoy and learn from the activities as well. A terrific homeschool, preschool, or school resource."
3,Disappointing,"I was a little disappointed in this book. Family Math and Peggy Kaye's Games for Math cover similar territory in a much better way. The activities in those books are more fun and the authors do a better job of explaining what skills kids will learn from doing the activities. There are a half dozen or so projects I will try, but most of them don't seem worth the effort."
4,arts and science,"The book exceeded our expectations. Almost all of the activities are very inexpensive and are things readily available. (like ice art) So many clever and creative ideas to incorporate art into math and science. It's not like teaching 10th graders geometry and have them make a stain glass window, but rather an art class that utlilizes math and science."
4,Almost Perfect,"Product arrived in great time! This razor is an exceptionally good razor when used wet with shaving cream or soap. Closest to a blade then anything else I've used. However if shaving dry it is just a mundane adequate, my old Norelco was better. As long as you use it ""wet"" you'll be very satisfied."
2,Doesn't give close shave,"I had the ES 8023 prior to this and it was great. After several passes over all areas of my face this shaver does not get close. AFTER I shave with the 8043sc, I then go over it with my $20 Remington to finish the shave. Geez what is the story with this shaver? It does hold a charge for 2+ weeks, it does have a nice feel, and it doesn't pull or yank hairs due to high speed. BUT DOES NOT give a close shave. I have an average beard."
1,Bald Head Shavers,If you shave your head don't waste your time or money with this shaver. It does not give you a close shave and cuts other parts of your head unevenly. Had to go back over spots multiple times.
4,An aggressive beast that needs frequent cleaning,"I recently shifted from 20 years of using norelco rotary razors to this foil shaver. It gives a much closer shave...so close that I've gotten a few nicks from it. However, it's not fast. Since it seems to work much like a conventional razor, you do have to draw it slowly accross your skin. It does take fewer passes than my old norelco, but overall it seems like a slower but closer shave. It cleans-up easily, but you have to empty the cuttings and clean the head every other or every third day. A bit more involved to get really clean but so far I like it."
5,Great Razor,I've had this razor about six months and it works great. i dislike the cost of blades though.
1,not happy!,Does not cut close enough. Only maintains a charge for 3 shaves and then is completely discharged.I am extremely unhappy particularly as I was unable to return it!!!
1,terrible shaver,I bought this shaver 6 months ago. My son uses it once or twice a week. He takes care of it and cleans it. Today it just stopped working completely. What a waste of $100!
4,Good and Bad,"This shaver has strengths and weaknesses.Strengths: It is fairly good shaver, that works quickly, wet or dry.Weaknesses: The extension for sideburns or other hair is almost worthless, and the razor has trouble picking up some neck hair, even after repeated passes.Overall, a good value for the money, and performs as well as the 300 dollar Braun (which I had)."
5,Great shaver for the price,"I've owned this shaver for over a year now and I have replaced the blades only once, maybe twice. I have owned 2 other Panasonic shavers before this one, and this is by far the best bang for the buck. The best part is the battery still keeps a good charge. Which is the only reason I had to replace my previous Panasonic's."
3,OK for the money,For the money spent it does an ok job. I had a different model previously that cost $200 and shaved quicker with a wider blade
5,Panasonic Pro-Curve ES80443SC - I Like It,"This is far and away the best electric shaver I have ever used. It is light, comfortable to use, and shaves closer than a blade in hard to get to places and almost as close elsewhere. I shave with lather and it is very confortable. It takes me about 5 or 6 minutes per shave and the battery lasts for 12 or 13 shaves. I used a Norelco rotary for many years. It was good (dry shaver) but this new Panasonic is superior. It is also superior to the older Panasonic ES8092 which was much heavier with shorter battery life. What especially impresses me about the new shaver is its ability to cut neck hairs very closely. I highly recommend this shaver."
1,Disappointed User,"Gave this promising well reviewed shaver a good try (about 3 months), but it's inability to provide a close shave, particularly in the chin and neck areas, combined with receiving frequent bleeding cuts, made me toss it into the drawer for no further use. And my beard isn't even very thick. I only shave every other day. I'm back to a Norelco triple rotary shaver, which performs better. I shouldn't have defected in the first place. Panasonic may sell very good shavers, but they're probably in the higher price range. I don't recommend this one."
4,Great Shaver,"This is a great shaver. I previously used a Braun, serviceable though unspectacular. The Panasonic is much lighter, cleans easier, and shaves much closer. I have only used the shaver for about a month but I cut my shaving time considerably with the Panasonic."
4,Panasonic Razor,"As advertised; a well made product. Cuts clean and comfortable, but can leave stubble if you are not careful. Ability to shave wet is a plus. It cleans easily and the batteries are long-lasting. I won't abandon it, but I will buy the top of the line Norelco again next time."
2,Nice design but...,"I have always used foil-type shavers and bought this Panasonic as an ""upgrade"" to my older Braun Syncro. Several of the design features are very nice - very quiet, light, ergo friendly. The problem is the shave quality is not as good as I am used to and it PULLS HAIRS. I can live with the so-so shave quality but this hair pulling is ridiculous and something that I have never had with other shavers. It doesn't matter if it is fully charged or not and it doesn't matter how long I go between shaves - it always grabs some whiskers and yanks them out. A real eye opener. Anyway, I shaved with this shaver 12-15 times and gave up - I'm back to my noisy and worn out Braun."
5,Panasonic electric shaver,"I have used this razor for 1 month and find it shaves faster and closer than my old Grundig. I like that I can clean it with ordinary liquid soap and do not need to buy special cleanser. I can get more than 10 shaves out of the battery (I have a light beard.) Since I have always used an electric razor, I did not require any ""adjustment"" time as other have indicated they needed. Having an electric razor that I can use in or out of the shower has been a real treat. I highly recommend this razor."
5,Bought as a gift,"After reading the reviews I bought this because it was affordable and sounded like a great buy. My boyfriend said he really likes it because it shaves his face very well. I have to agree with my boyfriend because his face can look and feel pretty rough, but after using this shaver his face is very soft. He really loved that I bought this gift for him. The only downside is that this shaver did not get the neck hairs thoroughly."
3,Not Bad,A little louder than I'm accustomed from an E Razor.I prefer the 3 blade system but this unit is ok at best for the price.
4,Excellent Wet/Dry Electric Razor,Some of the best shaves I've ever gotten with an electric razor. Easy to use and clean. Holds a charge for around 7-10 days worth of shaves and recharges quickly.
3,it's just okay,"I bought this razor because I'd been having problems with razor bumps from shaving with from regular razors. This one was recommended to me so I got it.Pros - I like the wet/dry feature since I usually shave in the shower. I also liked the pop-up trimmer, not more cuts trying to shave my mustache.Cons - It really doesn't deliver a very close shave. I'd been using it for over a month and after every shave, I could still feel some stuble no matter how long I spend trying to get it all off. I asked my doctor about it and she recommended using some of that old fashion shaving powder instead of a razor. I tried that and it worked like a charm, the razor bumps are all fading away. I just wish I knew about it before I bought this razor."
3,5 minute shave,"It take me five solid minutes to shave with this thing because the main blades do such a poor job on the neck area that I have to use the trimmer on this ""tough"" spot. I'd probably quit using this and go back to a regular razor, but I get awful razor burn on my neck from using a straight razor that I don't get nearly as bad with this item. I've been using this thing for eight months."
4,Panasonic Electric shaver,Does a great job.Only one problem. My 5 year old Panasonic shaver could be placed vertically on a small charging stand. With this model you have to pull out the charging cord from the shaver if you want to do a cordless shave. Which is why I purchased it in the first place.
3,Good Shave.....But......,"Alright there are plenty of good reviews here so I will keep mine quick and simple.Pros:1) It recharges fast, feels light and good grip.2) The pivot head makes simple to shave around the neck.Cons:1) Feels cheap. I am comparing it with my Norelco.2) Charger: Its HUGE! Again comparing to my Norelco.3) Bag: Its the cheapest thing I've EVER seen. Useless. My Norelco came with a nice leather bag and had a tight fit around my razor.4) No battery meter: Although it claims to have a 5 minute emergency charge.With this said, I regret not getting the cheaper ES4026 that was highly recommended by consumer reports.http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES4026NC-Rechargeable-Double-Shaver/dp/B0001209OO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1245198876&sr;=8-1"
4,"Great shaver, but ok on the neck","This is my first electric shaver, and the first couple of times I used it its been pretty good...definitely not as close as a regular razr but for an electric one it seems pretty good. I got an electric shaver to prevent in grown hairs and so far its been doing an above average job. However, the shaving the neck can be a pain sometimes, and I resulted in razor burn from it. You definitely need to the trimmer to cut off extra hairs that the shaver cannot cut through.Overall I give this is a 4/5 because it just doesnt seem as closecut as I thought it would be."
5,Surprised!!! Delighted with performance!,Never thought a linear shaver could cut closer than a rotary on a bald head.Highly recommend. Easy to clean.
3,Sounded good from the other reviews,"I read other reviews before deciding on this shaver. I've used Norelco shavers for 15-20 years so this was a change. This was my first wet/dry shaver. This one seems to take longer and more passes to get all the stubble. Cleaning is easy though. I think next time I'll try another Norelco model. I like the 3 floating heads. I think they do a better job, at least for me."
1,cheaply built,"I have owned 2 of these, the last for less than 1 1/2 years, and in both cases, one of the clips that hold the top part of the razor on has broken off, so that the screen pops off constantly. Knowing this might happen, I was very gentle with the second razor, but to no avail.Only 1 1/2 years for a $80+ razor is unacceptable. I will not get another Panasonic razor."
3,not very good,"just got it and tried. it's a little noisy, and have to push hard many times to shave clean."
5,Excellent compact electric shaver,"I am very satisfied with this shaver. My last electric, a Remington rotary razor, was not nearly as good to me. My skin did not react well at all to its rotary blades. But the Panasonic is great. I have only used the dry function for shaving, and it provides a great shave. The linear blades don't disturb my skin or give me ingrown hairs. I also appreciate how easy it is to clean - just a rinse, or a bit of soap and a rinse - and done. The battery life is great (way better than my Remington). I probably charge it twice a month. And I quite like the style: compact and sleek, it's very easy to handle.The one downside that I can think of is that this shaver is pretty noisy. Kind of surprising for how small it is. But definitely not a big deal. Overall great choice."
3,It is alright for certain things.,Wet shave - good on face.Dry shave - great on face.Wet shave on neck - not good.Dry shave on neck - alright.BaTTERY LIFE - Awesome
5,Great quality - Panasonic does it again,"Purchased this as a replacement for one lost in a luggage screw-up on a recent plane trip. It's the same brand (Panasonic) but a different model. I was always pleased with the old one, but hoping it wasn't just a fluke... It wasn't. Panasonic still lives high on my list for quality products. Good performance, long-lasting battery charge, durable, performs just as advertised."
1,Not happy about the 8043,I have used this Panasonic 8043 for maybe 3 years now. It does not do the job nearly as well as my old ES7003 Panasonic. I use it but am not happy with it. Best thing I did was find a source that repairs or rebuilds or was able to get parts for my old Panasonic ES7003. I ordered new replacement batteries and fixed it myself. Outdoes the 8043 hands down. I have a Braun too that I use for sensitive areas (neck)etc and love it also. I have used the Norelco triple blade job. Don't like it at all. We are all so different. I recommend for repairs or parts the Appliance Repair Center in San Francisco. Great service and will save your favorite shaver or any appliance that uses rechargable batteries.
3,Not as good as a blade razor,"I've used this shaver for over two years now and just realized that it's not quite as good as I thought. I've replaced the foil and head every year, as recommended and, while it works, it just doesn't shave as close as I'd like. Recently I started shaving at my gym in the morning, using a two blade disposable razor and was surprised to find that I was getting a much closer shave than with the Panasonic. For a long time I'd been telling myself that the electric was ""just as good"" as a blade. I used it both wet and dry and the results were pretty similar. I'll keep it for travel purposes but am heading back to blades."
4,"Good, solid shaver.","Have been using this shaver for close to a year. Sure the blades are getting dull and I should upgrade but the battery (and the blades) have paid for them selves and overall the performance is still acceptable. I have thick, coarse facial hair yet this shaver still does an acceptable job at cutting smooth enough to get me through most of my work-day.Would purchase again!"
1,Breaks very fast,This product broke down write after one year. Planned yes for sure no longer returnable. This is the environmental stuff we really should be worried about.
4,Best Panasonic shaver so far,"I've been using Panasonic shavers for about a decade now and this is the best one i've had so far... very smooth, very comfortable to hold, quiet (compared with others i've had), great battery life.my only complaint is that it doesnt come with any kind of stand, which is odd since the base of the shaver is tapered and not very stable, you'd think they would have included one.... especially since the foils on these things are so fragile, getting knocked over is usually how they get knicks. I called Panasonic just to let them know and they said they would send me out a stand free of charge, however 3-4 weeks later i've yet to receive it."
1,Very Happy was not now,"It's all been said so I'll just add.1. Wet/Dry works but even water helps irritation burn, I use water andI get less irritation. (Only used it a few times)2. Close shave (I've used other shavers this is better) but don't tellme its as close as a razor; however it's close enough, very good ifnot excellent.3. I've had no razor pull at all but after shave lotion is needed.If they had 1/2 stars Id give this product 4 1/2 stars.*******************************************************Only lasted 4 months, fell apart, pinched a lot, not close any more. Who wants to pay $60 for 4 months use."
4,Panasonic ES8043SC,"I purchased this shaver to replace an older Panasonic (Model ES7018) that had served me well for many years. This new shaver is much improved over the older one. I especially like the speed of the motor and it is much quieter. I use wet shaving and find I can get a good close shave much faster than before. This shaver model does not come with a stand for charging and, if I had known, I would have gotten the ES8044 instead. There is a charging cord that plugs into the bottom so the shaver has to be placed on it's side. Depending on where it is stored, it's more susceptible to damage."
5,The best electric shaver,"This is the best electric shaver I've ever used. The battery life is fantastic -- on a full charge on Sunday, I can use it for a whole week without any perceptible loss of power. The quality of the shave is fantastic -- especially if used with some pre-shave gel, it gives a very close, comfortable shave without leaving my skin dry or irritated. Ergonomics of the shaver are very well done, it is nice to hold, the cushion/pivoting of the shave head is neither too firm nor too soft, and overall, this is just a fantastic buy. HIGHLY recommended in all regards!"
5,Best shave I have ever had!,"This wet/dry razor with a few drops of shave oil gives me the closest shave ever inside or outside the shower. Through the years I have used Braun, Norelco, Remington and Gilette razors with gels, creams etc. The others don't come close to the Panasonic wet/dry shaver. I put a few drops of shave oil in the palm of my wet hand and rub my face and head (except the bald part!). I wet my face and head in the shower and shave. To clean up I use a line of liquid soap along the center of the razor and turn it on under running water and that's it!"
4,Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve Linear Wet/Dry Shaver,"Not a bad shaver, fits the hand well, but does not shave as close as the Braun 360 razor I have, but a good razor. Comes with a cloth bag as a travel case, a little cheap."
2,Poor performance,After using this razor for over six months I purchased a Norelco because I was so dissatisfied with it. It took forever to shave my neck and even then stubbles could be seen within several hours. I tried different ways of shaving and they all gave me poor results. Not only was the neck a problem but the overall shave was no better. I certainly would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,No Charging Station,"I just recieved the Panasonic ES8042SC from Amazon. I didn't notice there is no charging station for the razor. The Braun it is replacing was half the price and worked fine for nearly five years and included a charging station. This is going to be step back in convience, pluging in the cord constantly and having the razor laying on the counter..... NOT GOOD"
3,Not gud not bad,"I thought i could shave at the speed of light :| (in 5 minutes or so). but it takes abt 20 minutes to get a decent shave, of course in shower. Maybe its because my face has some baby fat. i might try a lesser speed rotational shaver from norelco philips soon.Also i find that i could shave with just the trimmer at the back faster than with the shaver :|"
3,ES8043SC,first of all it didn't fit in my hand very well. Although I do have small hands. The on botton is indented which makes it hard to find in the shower. It didn't cut well under the sides of my chin. But actually I like the Panasonics and have a ES8807 which I love. In fact I'm buying another one for travel.I'm very much impressed with Amazon's return policy and just ordered this 2nd one from them.
3,"appears cheap, disagreeable whine","This electric shaver does work, but its outside finish and design is not appropriate to an eighty bucks price.Also, the motor's sound makes a high whining noise.Returned it."
4,Oh they crackle,"I have a couple of these candles because they do crackle. If you are sitting and reading a book you can definitely hear the crackle and the ambience is wonderful. The smell is a bit overwhelming, I wouldn't get a scent you aren't in love with... My only complaint is that they crackle so much I get nervous that a spark is going to fly out of the candle. So I wouldn't leave the room for long if you have one lit."
2,The Crackle Is a Gimmick,"These hefty candles boast that they produce a fire-like crackle. The reality is that they crackle less loudly than those birthday candles that don't blow out. After about one minute, it's clear that you're not going to stop building fires in the fireplace and replace them with the alleged similar sounds of these candles. I ordered about a dozen of these as gifts, and the common response from the recipients after using them is that the scent produced is ""overbearing"" to the point that the candles are not preferred. One can easily fill up 1,000 square feet in about thirty minutes. The scents' heaviness are really overwhelming, which may be good when trying to cover other fumes, but not suggested for subtle or romantic mood-making."
3,Denta Clean Sugar Free Breath Mints for Dogs,"I gave this product a three star because my dog will not bother with them. I thought these would be something he would chew on but he has no interest in them, however; I wish he did because he could use a bit of breath refresher. Brushing his teeth does not really do the job. I am sure it is because of the dog food that has fish in it. This product may be great for other dogs, but my dog does not like any thing unless it smells like cat food - which we have to keep him away from!"
5,Very nice bag,"Bought this bag for my daughter who was a bridesmaid this summer. It matched the silver shoes she wore and was large enough to fit some makeup, her cell phone and her keys. She will definitely use this bag again. Very reasonable price."
3,ECONOMIC PRODUCT,I STILL HAVE NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT YET BUT I THINK THE PRODUCT YOU SELL HAS A NICE ECONOMIC PRICE OVER ALL
1,No regrowth.........,I bought this product for my mother who is 79 years old. She has very fine hair. She has been using Cre-C for about 3 weeks now and neither she nor I notice a difference in her hair. I do not recommend this product.
4,interesting mix,"Interesting mix of fantasy, Christianity and adventure. The writing moves along nicely and keeps you wanting more. I cant wait to read the next one!"
4,Another star from Brazil,It seems that Brazilian has an endless supply of great female singers. Here is another one! This is very well put toghether cd.
4,Energyzing,"""One of house music's most respected producers, Kevin Yost hasreceived acclaim all over the world for his smooth, jazz infusedreleases. 'KY Funk & Stuff (B-Sides & Session Tapes)' has beencompiled to highlight some of Yost's grestest productions,previously only available on vinyl. Included are the earlyclassics 'Spring Again', 'Hip On You' and the title track 'KYFunk & Stuff', as well as four brand new studio tracks - checkout 'Seasons Change', a beautiful downtempo moment. Deep jazzyhouse of the finest order."""
1,Get something else,"Comes as in the picture: unlubed and in multiple pieces. Unlubed would be fine if it had a zert, but instead you have to pack the dust boot before installing it. It's borderline impossible to install the dust boot without tearing it unless you have specialty equipment to press it on. Unless you're a professional mechanic (or outfitted like one), buy something preassembled and save yourself the trouble."
2,Not too helpful...,"We used this book in a class...good thing I already had experience with HTML!This book does a basic job teaching HTML. When you're done this, you'll be able to use different fonts and things..tables if you're lucky. As for ""advanced"" concepts, you won't see them here.As for JavaScript, forget it. They essentially have you copy a bunch of their code down and see what it does. Not as in depth as javascript needs at all...Oh, and by the way, if you need to learn how to use Notepad, how to save an HTML file, or other basic things, they go REALLY in depth with that."
2,"Do this, this, and that, I'll explain later. . .","I found this book to be quite disappointing.. It was awfully short, though it did introduce many important concepts. I'm not sure that I agree with the lesson plans. It gives you instructions to copy down certain codes, then gives a brief explaination later on about what you did. I came across a few errors, and since they have recently updated their resources webpage, there is no access to the pictures in which the book refers to."
2,Don't Buy,"I've been working with this book in order to create a Web Development course for high school students and I have come to really dislike this book. To its credit, it covers most of the basics that people will need to get into HTML and JavaScript. However, the organization is rather poor with the sections being a collection of random material. And much is not explained in enough detail for people to really understand what is going on or what can be done. The material is not up to date either by including some tags that most people would consider deprecated. I also feel that they do not truly understand the purpose of technologies like JavaScript and how to use them. Overall, an introduction to some basic aspects of the technology, but without enough information or understanding of the technology."
