3,cats love the scratch pad but not the rolling ball,My cats love to scratch the pad (which is great cause it saves the furniture) but they do not play with the rolling ball. Would i recommend this item? Eh maybe.
3,Golf Ball Not Included,"My cat loves it. The three stars are all from her.I bought this toy because a friend has two cats who have enjoyed their Turbo Scratcher for a decade.Two problems with the one I received:#1 - The ball wasn't round. Badly molded plastic that went far too slowly around the track with an egg-like wump wump motion. I replaced it with a golf ball, and that works fine, maybe even better than a properly formed plastic ball would.#2 - The color. It wasn't possible to choose the color of this toy when ordering. My cat may not be offended by a pukey shade of turquoise, but I am. I was hoping for dark green, gray, even red--anything but pukish turquoise. I may hide it when friends come over. I'm pretty sure the hue has already decreased the resale value of my home.I suppose it's marginally unfair to gripe about the color when the product title includes ""colors may vary."" But if colors may vary, colors are therefore varied, and why can't a customer choose among those varied colors?"
5,Cats love this toy!!!!!,"I have 3 indoor/out door cats and one indoor only cat, with only one who won't play with it. The indoor cat thinks this was the best invention ever made with or without cat nip added. The 2 other cats are in love with it, but one of them swears there is an animal going around and around that he must catch and catch it NOW!!!!The indoor cat uses it all the time to scratch with no nip added. I'm surprised sometimes since he really enjoys doing it. The other 2 do not use it since they can find a tree when they are out side a few hours a day.The only draw back is if you put this on a wood floor since it can be loud with the ball whipping around. The problem is corrected if the toy is put on carpet.Oh, do not give up hope if your cat doesn't play with it right away. Just add the nip once and over time they will wonder what that is and figure out the ball moves.Have FUN!!!!!!!"
4,My kitten loves this!,"The Starchaser - a legendary cat toy most owner buy, whether they like it or not. For good reason too since a ball rolling in a groove seems to be irresistible to every cat I've met, including mine. There's just something about it that will keep your cat coming back for more. Even without the provided catnip, my kitten was immediately intrigued and this toy is second only to his bell teaser. The only thing I don't get here is why a piece of plastic with cardboard in the middle costs $15. There's really no cheaper alternative and very few things my cat loves more.Pros:My kitten LOVES itAn independent toyCons:Expensive for what it isNoisyBottom line: You might think ""why am I paying $15 for this?"" until you realize that your cat's happiness is priceless."
5,A hit with the cats!,"My cats LOVE this toy. They can scratch it, play with the ball, watch the other cat play with the ball, or just sit in the middle so the other cat can't play with it - hours of fun for cats.This is one of those toys that all cats love - and is inexpensive enough to replace when they scratch out the middle (which they will - because they love it!)."
5,So simple yet they love it,My cats are picky about toys. they usually don't play with what I buy (no matter how expensive) or they lose interest. Not so with this toy. I am floored...they both play with this and scratch on the cardboard 24-7. Now I wonder if the cardboard is available as a refill or if I will have to buy a whole new turbo scratcher.
3,Played with for the first several weeks,"Not all cats go for the cardboard scratchers apparently. And swatting a ball that goes round and round over and over can only be entertaining for so long, I suppose. Fun while it lasted!"
5,cat toy,I have 2 himalayans and 1 persian and they all fight to play with this they even sit on top of it to prevent the others from playing it hours of entertainment for cats
4,She loves it!,"I've seen this toy before but was hesitant to get it. I'm really glad that I did however because my kitten loves it. As soon as she got it, she laid down on it, scratched it and played with the ball inside. It gets her pumped up to play with her other toys too.The only problem would be that the ball is a little loud and if your kitten decides to play in the middle of the night, oh yes, you will definitely wake up to it. So I suggest keeping it away from the bedroom at night."
5,"What a fun, great toy!","Got a new kitten, went bonkers on buying toys. So far, this one is the biggest hit! Small kitten is crazy, and gets to go nuts chasing the ball around and around and around and around... She hasn't figured out about the scratching pad, but I'm sure she'll love that, too, when the time comes! Great purchase!!! The ball seems really sturdy/solidly made, and even my 2 year old wants to play with it!Highly recommended!"
4,throne,"My cat still prefers the couch, but does love the scratching portion as a throne while she bats the ball around. Cute idea, and the catnip is always nice."
5,Most of my Cats like this,"As most of you know, cats are cats, and have different tastes. But out of my 8 cats, 6 or 7 play with this, or rip into the pad, or both. I just heard somebody playing with it now, yes, Buddy, my top cat. Make that 7 or 8 cats, I don't think I saw Buddy playing before now. A hint, before you use it, put some white glue (which is non toxic) on the center of the pad, they tend to rip into that center, and then unravel it quickly, the glue prevents this and the pads last a lot longer. Good cat toy, but no guarantees with any cat, as most cat owners know."
1,"Okay Product, But My Cats Prefer the Bergan Star Chaser","This is a okay product, but my cats don't play with it. However, I recently purchased theBergan Star Chaser(by the same company) and my cats LOVE that one! The main difference is it has a lighted ball. This one does not.The concept is the same in both Bergan products: a central scratching post area, a track, a ball, and catnip. The lighted ball in the Star Chaser does not stay lit continuously. It only lights up for a few seconds after your cat bats at it. This makes it very exciting for your cat! Even my 18-year-old deaf cat watches the Star Chaser. The Turbo Scratcher with the plain ball lacks that excitement factor."
2,"Great, if your cat will use it","In general, my cat Loves toys, as well as scratching things. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to transfer to the turbo scratcher. She will use it occasionally (rarely).. but for the most part it just takes up space. I tried adding some catnip, too, but that didn't seem to help. From the reviews, it seems most cats love them. It looks like a lot of fun, I just don't understand why she doesn't play with it.EDIT: I loaded this thing up with catnip a few times a day for about a week and now my cat uses it occasionally. Even still, it's rare for her to hit the ball.. but she does sometimes. She mostly likes to scratch. Maybe that's because the cardboard is now loaded with catnip!"
5,Impressed,"I've had cats for over 25 years, and this is the only toy i've ever seen any of my cats take a re-occurring interest in. My little boy plays with it at least once a day, and sometimes i don't even have to get it started for him, he'll just come up to it and start doing somersaults and punching the ball like a speed-bag -- I'm really impressed and it was a great buy and worth the price."
4,Cat gets bored with it.,"My cat still goes by and bats the ball around every now and then, but she got bored with it not long after I purchased it, and since she no longer has claws the scratcher pad doesn't interest her."
5,My cats love this,"This is one of my cat's favorite toys. They both play with it, and they both use the scratching pad, too. The rolling noise can be annoying if you're trying to sleep, so put it somewhere that it won't bother you."
3,Not as good as the reviews say,"I've heard so many rave reviews so had high expectations but my kitten is super ""meh"" about this toy. She uses the scratcher more than she plays with the ball - in fact, I never hear her playing with it. She needs me to make it move first. And even then she just watches. Yawn."
3,Okay,"I like this. Unfortunately, my cats don't. I really, really wanted them to. I think the repetitive motion is a bit boring for them, but it's definitely a cat preference thing. This might be better for a kitten as they tend to be more easily amused. They don't like the scratcher either.I wanted to get them a toy that they could play with during the day while my husband and I were at work. They have played with it a few times, but I don't think they've touched it in months. We constructed ""tunnels"" that cover part of the track so that the ball was ""hiding"" which made it a little bit more interesting for them, but not much.However, they seem to prefer small toys they can bat around and interactive pole toys."
2,Scratch pad is only part used.,"Scratch pad is only part used by one cat, out of four. Kitten batted the ball around twice and that was that. None of them have played with it since. I saw a fun video on U tube, which prompted me to buy it but my cats show no interest. My one cat sleeps on it, she loves the corrugated cardboard or maybe it is the catnip?? I bought online but found it cheaper in the box stores but I wouldn't recommend buying it."
3,Its a great idea my cat doesnt go for,"She played with it non-stop for like 2 days, but now has other, much smaller, much cheaper toys (specifically mylar balls) that she will chase for hours all around my apartment, instead of just batting this in a circle. Maybe while I'm at work she plays with it, but not much when I'm home."
5,"annoying at 2am, but great any other time","My cat loves her Bergan Turbo Scratcher, especially when I put in the Twinkle Ball Replacement. The sound of the ball going around is kind of noisy. Catman didn't really like the catnip that was included."
3,"It's a great product, for younger cats.","I can't fault the product itself - it's well-made and certainly fulfills its functions. My cat is an older cat of about 8 years and loses interest quickly. Had a few plays on this before it was abandoned altogether. I'd recommend it for owners of more than just one cat, and preferably younger cats. That way the product gets a lot more use."
2,"My cat loves it, but it makes a mess","OK, so my cat really loves this, and it is helping to save our furniture. However, why oh why couldn't they have put sisal or something sturdier in the center of it instead of cardboard. Oh....wait, I know why - because they wanted to make more money selling refills...got it. Never mind."
3,Much better toys out there,"I've had this for at least a month now. My cats do play with this, but not often. It is at most...5 minutes a day. Maybe they play with this when everyone in the house is gone - no real way to verify unless I set up a camera. I put catnip on the scratcher, but they only go for the catnip and ignore the ball. But yea in summary, they play it... they just aren't as crazy about it as they are with, let's say, a shoelace, or a crumpled piece of paper, or the cat dancer, or a laser, or da bird. All of which are so much better than this expensive toy.I suppose this is good if you are away and your cats are bored. But I think if you give your cats access to a window, it won't be bored. I always see my cats perched onto my window every time I come home. They seem to love it. It's pretty funny and they are getting their mental stimulation by watching real birds and such.This is a review written by someone who owns a 2 year old cat and a 5 month old kitten."
3,Kitty Litter Box,"This gizmo was larger than I realized and my younger cat was enamored with it right out of box, playing with it off and on the first day, fascinated by the ball rolling around like some roulette table. Unfortunately the older cat, promptly peed in the middle where the corrugated paper ""scratching pad"" was, mistaking it for a kitty litter box! Needless to say, even after removing the pad and cleaning it thoroughly, the ""stink"" was still in it causing the other one to pee in again. It was kaput. After only one days use I had to throw it away!! Never buy paper type scratch boards again."
5,Excited kittens.,One of the three kittens specializes in rolling the ball around and around while the other kittens watch. One of the kittens especially likes the scratch pad. Sometimes two kittens bat the ball back and forth like a game of tether ball. They get pretty excited. I recommended this product to my mom.
3,Nice scratching and defective noisey ball,I was disappointed to find the ball I got didn't flash unless it was *really* smacked. It spun around with a satisfying loud noise and this amused the cat for a day while it was novel.I tried to open and fix the ball- that went poorly!But the cat has little interest in this thing beyond the interesting variation of being able to scratch on the same surface she's standing on. She does seem to enjoy that cheap rough cardboard under her feet at times.
3,Love it!!,"Jan 18, 2011: My two cats LOVE this silly toy! The only thing is that they don't scratch on the middle section, but they love to play with the ball. Contrary to other reviewers: the ball has yet to come out of the toy so maybe the manufacturer fixed this problem(?). Otherwise, they play with this thing for hours!September 9, 2011: this toy which was so wonderful in the beginning is now collecting dust in the corner of my livingroom. After about a month, my cats were no longer amused with this toy and thus, don't even pay it any attention. It was a waste of my $$. I change my review from 5 stars to 3."
5,Cats love it!,Our cats love this. First they sit on it and then they start to bat the ball. Their favorite time to play is around 5AM so don't keep it in your bedroom. :-)
1,(yawn),"I read all the positive reviews about this product and got all excited about it for my cat. she was less enthusiastic. In fact, she batted it around a couple of times and then walked away. I had to BEG her to play with it, which she obliged a few times then went on to bigger and better things, like the extension cord. My cat is very active, very playful, and not a couch potato. The cardboard stuff in the middle----she just sits on it, she is not compelled to scratch on it at all. She much prefers my couch, much to my disappointment, I was hoping to distract her with this contraption. The construction of this product is not great, but it's a cat toy, and it's $12 so not very high expectations anyway. It will certainly suffice, but sadly, my cat is not going for it."
1,"Fine product, but Cat has no interest","Seems to be of good quality, however the cat has no interest in it. He loves cardboard for scratching, but even that does not seem to attract him to this toy. Who knows what goes on in that furry little head?"
1,A loser,"The cats like it, but they quickly learned how to remove the ball from the plastic track. Obviously they can't put the ball back in, making this toy pretty useless."
1,boring.,"The ""ping pong ball in a circular track... is cute looking and solidly built....and it does not amuse the typical cat... Mine gave the ball one whack, and saw its ""circular logic"" and yawned and abandoned it...A ""No Go""."
1,"No miracle cure, that's for sure.","I bought this cause it seemed like a steal with all the great reviews, but my cat doesn't even pay attention to it. She's way too damn cool for a piece of plastic with a ball that weighs five times as much as the foam balls she'd much rather kick around like the awesome little soccer player that she is.She just loves scratching the couch. I've rubbed lemon/lime/orange zest on it, I've put double-sided tape on it, I've even duct-taped the cat scratcher replacement pads on the areas she scratches. She still finds a place on the couch to scratch, and if I try bringing her to the scratcher right as she starts to scratch the couch, she gives me this look like ""I'm over it. Nice try though."""
1,First thing kitty did was sit on it and then PEED!,"Well, that pretty much sums it up, doesn't it? Poor thing, I guess he thought it was an extension of his litter box. Luckily, all the pee went into the ball channel and not on my new rug. I brought it outside and hosed it down. Now it's outside on the patio, and I'm sure that's where it will 'live' for some time to come. Sorry, cat toy FAIL!"
5,A great toy that will keep your cat busy,My 8 month old kitten loves this. The first thing he does when he wakes up in the morning is use the scratch pad in the center. Then he enjoys batting the ball around the track. It keeps him occupied for quite a while each time he plays with it. It's a great toy and scratching pad in one. It keeps him from scratching the furniture too! It includes some catnip to sprinkle in the center to attract your cat. I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm ordering the replacement pads too because this is one I think he'll be using for a long time!
4,Like it a lot first but now rarely play,"Brought this for the Tuxedo Kitten, was very excited and like it a lot first, but now isn't too interesting at it. Too bad is past 30 days and can't be return... but anyway is probably are more suitable for multiple cats, because solo cat might not be intersting as much, they prefer object move by the shelve then they move it."
5,Non-stop fun!!,I recently moved from a 3 bedroom apartment to a studio with my two 6 1/2 year old cats. I have been looking for stimulating toys that will encourage exercise in such a confined space. The turbo scratcher has been their favorite toy so far. They have both played non-stop with the turbo scratcher since it arrived. This is a must buy!!
3,OK but not for long,"This was a great toy for my 8 week old kitten. He didnt like/use the scratch pads at all...but he loved the ball. However it only took him about 5-10 minutes to figure out how to get the ball out. If you keep putting the ball back in, its a fun toy but doesnt serve as a great scratching utility."
2,I guess some cats are just not interested.,"I bought this item after reading all the positive reviews. Had a high expectation. However, my cat is just not interested, even after i put the catnip in the scratcher. I don't think there's anything wrong with the item itself, it's just that different cats like different stuff. Reading reviews give a general idea of the item quality, but how cats react to them... well you never know. So plz plz plz do not get misled that items with good reviews will definitely please your cats."
5,Loves it!,Couldn't find it in a store around my house and finally found it on Amazon. My Cat absolutely loves it and well so does my son.
4,"Cat loves it, maybe too much","My cat plays with this for hours. It is a bit noisy, but I turn it over when it's a bother. Like it a lot, but I wish they would send a more attractive color than blue. And I wish they would include an extra ball. I lost mine and had to order the whole thing again."
3,Kitteh luuurrrves this toy.,"My cat is hilarious as she bats this thing around while laying upside down or on top of it. She plays with it every day and even scratches it. Cat #2 occasionally joins in, but she's old and cranky. Meanwhile, bought one for boyfriend's cat and the little chump wants nothing to do with it. You win some, you lose some.Update: A few months later - 2 stars deducted because kitteh is boooored with this toy. I used to hear her playing with it all the time, but the thrill is gone. Ce la vie!"
4,Kittens love it,"I originally gave this product three stars because my cat wasn't very interested in it. However, my foster kittens LOVED it! They never get enough of watching that ball go around and trying to catch it. And the funny thing is, once my cat saw how much fun the kittens were having with it, she started to get more interested in it as well and now she plays with it fairly often!The cardboard is getting pretty ragged so I should get a new insert for it. The ball is still a ton of fun for the kitties though, so it almost doesn't matter since they have other places to scratch."
3,"Love it, BUT...","My cats ADORE this toy, and even play with each other on it batting the ball back and forth, but unfortunately they won't scratch it, so it's kind of a waste for me. It's very entertaining but now I need to find another scratcher. Still an excellent product."
5,THE BEST CAT TOY EVER!,I was thrilled to see that my cats played with this toy so I've purchased several of themand have given them as gifts. It's a crack up to watch your cat chase the ball and thenuse the center to scratch their claws instead of your furniture. GREAT buy but you shouldalso buy the refills while you're buying this toy. The refills are so affordable but so isthis toy. It will save your furniture from being shredded due to clawing.
5,"They love it, especially the scratch pad!","When I first got it my two kittens played with it for days! Nowadays the mostly just use the scratching pad, but they still use that all the time."
5,Cat Loves It!!,"My cat plays with this incessantly!! Whenever he has a lot of energy I just start rolling the ball and this toy keeps him busy for quite a while. It's also great for him to have something to do when I'm not around to play with him. I'd recommend keeping it away from any bedrooms though, because the ball is loud in the track and might wake a light sleeper."
5,Nice toy/scratcher for kitty.,"Our cat loves this product. Uses it several times a day. We needed the catnip to draw the cat to the product, but once he saw what it was all about, he uses it often sometimes lying across the surface and kicking the ball with his back paws."
5,takes care of our cat's scratching needs,"Our 7 month old cat uses this scratcher toy on everyday basis. She lost interest in the ball after a few days but keeps using the middle part to take care of her scratching and stretching needs. This one product is obviously not enough - we also use incline scratcher and sisal post which our cat alternates.Update 1 year later...Still works like a charm, our cat uses the scratcher every day. Just get refills and it still as good as new."
5,Favorite,"This is my one cats favorite toy. Keeps her occupied (even at 2 years old) for several minutes at a time where as most of their toys end up under something! I have it under a chair out of the way, just room enough for her fit and play."
5,Love it!,"I will probably need to buy a replacement cardboard piece for the center soon because my cat scratches it daily. She is 8 yrs old and not as playful as she used to be, but she LOVES this. I wish I would have been recording her the first time she checked it out...funniest thing ever! Her full size scratching post is downstairs, so it's nice to have something small upstairs for her to default too when she needs to scratch."
5,Love it,"My cat's favorite toy, You can hear the ball rolling, she will be sitting on the windowsill and every time she jumps down she goes for the ball."
4,Nice toy,"My cat was crazy for this the first week and it was all downhill from there. She now plays w/ it maybe once a week. I like the idea that it's a toy and scratcher. To improve on this design, the ball should open up to fill catnip with."
5,"The cats like the ""scratch"" thing...","Unfortunately, neither cat seemed interested in the ball. They both liked the ""scratch"" thing, though. I give it 5 stars because it arrived on time, and was as advertised. I give my cats 3 stars. Maybe they'll be more interested later.Update: September 21, 2012One of the cats batted the ball around for a minute or two, then went outside. The other cat still is afraid of the ball when it moves, but will scratch on the toy, at least. Both cats like to sit on it too."
5,Cats LOVE it!,"I have three cats and they all love the turbo scratcher. Because the cardboard is kind of an open weave, you can put cat nip on it and it falls down into the scratching area and doesn't get all over the carpet once it's worked in.My cats follow the thing from room to room if it gets moved. It's a great buy for the money!"
5,Cat toy for a cat that doesn't play.,"It's well-made and looks like fun, but my cat couldn't care less. We had a visiting cat here briefly who did love it, and sat right in the middle on the scratching part and bumped the ball around. So for the right cat, I would recommend this toy."
1,Eh??,"My cat played with this for about a month. Now he doesn't want anything to do with it. Even when I put fresh cat nip, he doesn't even want to rub his head into it."
2,Rather disappointing,"I bought this to entertain our 3 cats since they've gotten bored with their toys. They like the ball in the track well enough, but I am quite disappointed by the center cat scratching circle. I expected it to be something like jute - much like our other scratching posts - but when I opened it, I was dismayed to find it was nothing more than a roll of corrugated cardboard. I thought maybe it was just filling - but nope...only cardboard. None of our cats will even bother with it unless they sit on it to chase the ball. I suppose for the low price, I shouldn't care, but I really feel cheated because nowhere in the description does it say what the scratch pad was. Just so you know...it's nothing but cardboard in the middle. Rest of the toy's alright...I have a feeling I might be selling it in the near future from lack of use, but we'll see."
5,"Kittens, cats, seniors - they all love it!","I've had my Turbo Scratcher for more than twenty-five years. As a fifty year cat human, I have never seen a ""toy"" as successful. Kittens, cats, seniors - they all love it. They may neglect it during the summer months when they are mostly outside, but it is a must for winter or for indoor cats. Not only does it amuse them, they amuse me while using it - and it definitely saves my furniture and my carpet and whatever else they might have decided to use as a scratching post. Even with two cats the pad usually lasts a year, making maintenance very inexpensive."
1,"Cats love it, but ball is lost already","Sorry, but the ball is much too easily removed by the cats. They loved it, but by the end of the first evening, the ball was gone. It's not much use now. I would send it back if return shipping wouldn't be almost the price of the item."
4,Give them time,"After reading the rave reviews on this toy, I was worried when it arrived and my cats seemed only slightly interested. After a few days, though, they not only learned how to play with the ball, but now prefer to sleep draped across the toy."
4,Turbo Scratcher is a good toy and encourages scratching.,My eight month old cat has been using my furniture as a scratching source. This toy finds her scratching and playing with the ball. I also put a cardboard scratching pad next to it. My cat is using this pad to scratch on as well as the turbo scratcher. First time she has used the other scratcher. Well worth the money. My furniture thanks you.June
5,Great toy - cats love it!,"I have three cats and all of them (3-month kitten, 2-yr cat, 6-yr cat) love this toy. They take turns playing with it all day and night, and love the scratcher in the middle. Can't beat the price for the entertainment value this provides!!"
5,furniture saver,This scratcher is the ideal toy for redirecting my cat when she has the desire to exercise her claws. She gets a good amount of exercise playing stop and go with the ball.
2,Too Bad,"The cats loved this thing, but they got the ball out in less than 5 minutes and its long gone somewhere, they were loving it."
3,Cats not that interested,You just never know what toys a cat may be interested in. My younger cat thinks it's fun to stop the ball when I push it around but I never see either of my cats chasing it themselves. They also don't seem interested in the scratcher in the middle - I do have a tall scratching post they use. Usually I see my younger cat sleeping on top of it! LOL
5,The best toy I ever bought for my kitty,"Length:: 0:31 MinsI got my kitten at 8 weeks old from a shelter almost 2 months ago. She was weaned early from her mama and missed her litter-mates a great deal. Because of her seperation anxiety, she was very, VERY attached to me from the moment I brought her home. No toy pleased her enough to leave my side for more than 2 minutes. I ordered the turbo cat scratcher toy from Amazon mainly because of the dual purpose of having a place to scratch (other than my couch) and to entertain her. She loves this thing! She didn't hesitate at all. She's been playing with it for the last hour or so. She scratches on the scratcher part and chases the toy like it's her job. I very much recommend this toy for your kitty. If my high-maintenance feline was pleased, I'm sure yours will be too! I am including a short video of Rose playing with this toy."
3,Not much interest from our cats (sigh),"Picked this up at Walmart after all the glowing reviews here. Our two showed some interest for the first few days -- especially if we pushed the ball around first -- and it got a few scratches, but after a couple of weeks it just sat around, taking up space. Quite a lot of space -- it's a large, unattractive plastic object.Still, it might be worth a try, especially if you have some place to put it where you don't have to look at it. Costs about $10, and comes in various colors. Walmart also carries the cardboard scratcher-refills.Good luck!Cheers -- Pete Tillman"
3,Slightly disappointed,"I have heard great reviews of this toy, but for some reason, my cat is simply not interested in this toy. It is well made and would most likely be excellent for a multiple cat house hold where you can bat the ball around the runner, but he's just not interested and could care less. The toy is solid and sturdy but just not engaging for my cat for some reason!"
2,Cat Didn't like it that much,"My cat played with this for a few days and then lost interest pretty quickly. Never used the scratching part, just played with the ball and got bored pretty fast."
4,Every cat should have one!,"This is a great basic toy that every cat owner should have. It gives the cat a little exercise while providing them some entertainment. They'll certainly love the scratch pad in the center too! With the reasonable price point, I like to give this item as gifts to welcome new cats into homes and for cats that I pet sit for. They all seem to enjoy it. If it's in the same room that you sleep in though, you might hear that ball spin around the track while you're trying to sleep!"
2,Didn't give my cats the entertainment I expected,"My two cats of two years old were not interested in this as a toy. (which it is advertised as) they occasionaly sit or lay on it, but that's it. I had seen loads of videos and peoples reviews and expected, my young cats would at least be interested in it. I even used the free catnip supplied but this didn't make any difference. Sadley I was dissapointed in this product."
1,My cat just not interested,"I bought this toy about a week ago so my cat would have something to play with by herself. She will watch it when I spin the ball around, but has made no attempt to go after or bat the ball, nor scratch on the cardboard. Just not interested. (My dog DID try to get the ball out, but I didn't buy this toy for her!)"
5,Cats give it an A+++++++++,"Oh my goodness. This came in the mail today and my cats can't get enough of it. Without the catnip even! Daisy laid across it as if he was saying Mine Mine! He was batting at the ball and trying to bite it. Sayeh was rolling over in front of it, hitting the ball and then putting his paw on it. Twix who is reserved had a blast with it. I have to get another. There are going to be fights over this toy. My house is going to be a mad house with all the turbo tracks around."
5,FUN -FILLED TIME FOR OVERACTIVE CATS,"My Jasper, is very active!!! He just turned a year old. We have a few loving nicknames...Achmed, the dead terrorist, Lucifer!!! He runs all over, up n down the hallway over the furniture..all in a dead run, sounding like a herd of elephants! he LOVES this toy. It keeps his attention for hours on end. BEST PURCHASE in a cat toy I made!"
3,Cat ignored,"I was excited to order this product for our playful cat. He likes to chase and pounce, but he just didn't seem interested in this toy despite the cat nip we put on. I think out cat may not like scratching cardboard."
4,My cats love it!,I have 3 cats. They play with this constantly. I have purchased replacements at least 10 times. The only complaint I have is the mess it makes. Easy to vaccuum up but constant because it is used so much.
2,Very noisy,"This toy is VERY noisy. Not recommended if you live in a small place. Is not very sturdy or stable, either--the cats move it across the floor when they play with it. They like the ball, and sitting on the center, but have not seen either cat use it center bit as a scratching surface."
5,Like a Hamster Wheel for Cats,"We're always fascinated by the fact that our cats have never gotten bored with this toy. I don't know what's so exciting about it, but both of the cats we've had have loved it. A friend once called it a ""hamster wheel for cats,"" and that's a great description--they keep chasing the ball in circles and it doesn't seem to get old. Our cat likes to hide somewhere near the toy and ""hunt"" the ball. Her other favorite toys are cardboard boxes and paper bags (go figure), so we keep those near this toy to give her somewhere to hide. The cardboard insert is easily replaced when your cats have destroyed it, but we've only had to replace it once since our cat is more interested in chasing the ball than in using it as a scratching post. It really depends on what type of surface your cat likes to scratch. You can also sprinkle some catnip on it, but we rarely do that. Our cat loves it enough as it is."
3,"Intelligent Cats Will Peck at It, Good Price, Otherwise Not Incredible.","My cats, I think, are pretty intelligent and like human companionship and affection and each other's company more than any toy device. So they peck at the scratch part on occasion, and one was very interested with the ball (which is very smoothly designed, with a smooth countour, making it like a mini circular bowling lane, and irremovable) sliding, but other than that, they aren't too impressed with and vie for good ol fashioned human-friend playing/companionship, chasing each other, and making up their own toys. Fortunately this item was inexpensive and consider the price to be spot on (despite it's mundane reception with my cats)."
3,Not great as a scratcher,"This came in a huge box with a lot of paper packing. That was a plus for the cats. Cats always love the boxes more than the toys. As for the scratcher, it is a small scratching surface and my cats (12#+ each) can't quite figure how to position themselves to scratch. Back legs on the ground and they cannot get the elevation they need to scratch. Balancing all four paws on the scratching pad is awkward for them. However, my 18 mo. old cat is fascinated with the rolling ball. If you have a small cat or kittens I would recommend this. My 8-yr-old and 10-yr-old have no interest in playing with the ball so I wouldn't recommend it for older cats. I wish they had made the scratching surface larger. It would have been worth paying more for it rather than having a scratch pad that they won't use."
3,"Has possibilities, but scares my little kitten right now...","I first wish to say I find no faults or defects with this cat toy, I just think for a very small or skittish kitten it might not succeed. I have a Singapura kitten, which is a tiny breed, and I think the Bergan Turbo Scratcher is a bit intimidating to him. Loud noises such as the ball makes when it whirls around, jar him and the size of the ball may also be a bit too big and heavy for him until he gets a bit bigger. I still have hope for the toy, though, because he does watch the ball go round when I tap it, so he's not entirely indifferent. Also he is soon to be joined by a Siamese kitten who I think will be much bolder and show him its entertainment value. I will amend my review pending the Siamese ""test"". :)"
4,"I have TWO of these & LOVE it, BUT...","I live in a home with 19 cats (indoor/outdoor) an 6 dogs. All are rescued and spayed/neutered. Finding ways to keep all these little critters occupied is time consuming. A friend shipped me one of these a few months ago and my cats have loved it from the moment it came out of the wrapper! There are two drawbacks to the design of the scratcher, however. (1) The replacement pads CAN be removed by the cats if they shred the cardboard (and they will). (2) The ball with the laser in it is incredible (!) but it is EASILY REMOVED by an ornery cat. Be prepared to have extra chaser balls around because they quickly disappear and it's difficult to find them unless you move every bit of furniture to find them. Still highly recommend this product."
5,24/7 around the clock Party,"Can I say that my cat is absolutely addicted to this toy!!!I think it calls her name in the middle of the night.I feel her get up, look around, and sneak out of my room. She quietly tip toes over to the little turbo track, and then she zooms that ball around the track faster than the speed of lightning! It reminds me of playing tetherball on the playground in elementary school! ...around, and around, and around, and around!!!One Suggestion: Don't put this toy near your bedroom... if you want to sleep at night!!It's a 24/7 Cat Party!!!One More Suggestion: Buy the extra pack of balls!!! Like all addictions... you can't have just one!!"
2,Ball Not Included,"My cats could chase the ball around for hours -- if a ball had been included in the package. The thing comes sealed in plastic (and included the promised catnip), so the ball didn't fall out. Somewhere in China, there's probably a sweatshop worker trying to sell Bergan Turbo Scratcher balls to Siamese cats on the blackmarket.Amazon agreed to refund my money if I returned the ball-less cat toy, but that's a hassle. So is finding the right sized plastic ball, but I want to find out if the product frustrates my cats as much as it has me."
5,saved my sanity,"I was looking for a kitty toy with movement for my new kitty. I needed something to hold his attention other than my pet bird Lefty. The price was reasonable and the reviews were positive. With Amazon Prime, the Turbo Scratcher arrived in two days. What a difference! Instead of chastising my new kitty for hanging off the bird's cage, kitty played happily with the Turbo Scratcher and then fell asleep behind the bird's cage. Love it!"
5,Jess and Cavity approved!,"My cats love this scratcher, and it has lasted years.When Jess is vexed or excited, she always runs for it, scratches like mad, and then everything is all better. The ball was lost long ago, but the plastic circle remains. Replacement pads go in easy, and when one side is done, you flip it over and use the other. Cavity also loves this, and it has saved my sofa from being scratched. :)"
5,Item arrived before delivery date..,Received item before due date...my fur kid loves it....went to it and started playing as soon as I took it out of the box. Would recommend this vendor for any pet needs. Will order from seller again..
3,Not very interested,"I bought this product for my cat; he is about 2 years old. He is exceptionally curious, and didn't give this toy much interest. He still chooses to sharpen his nails on a chair, instead of the cardboard area on the toy. There are other cats in the house and far too many other ""toys"" to play with. I would recommend this for someone with only one cat or one that doesn't have many other stimuli."
3,Kept the cats entertained for 2 days!,"I bought two of these in different styles and they each arrived the same day and they each kept our 5 cats entertained for about 2 days. Then, they went back to their catnip filled, faux, furry mice and the mylar tinsel balls and the plastic balls with bells in them. The Turbos' now sit collecting dust and once in a while Dinkie, the Maine Coon/Tabby mix, will put a big paw under the ball and flip it out of the track and chase it :)"
3,It was fun -- for awhile...,"I bought this based on the high reviews it got... and right, after unpacking it from the box, both of my cats thought it was fun to see the ball go round-and-round... but after a week or two, they both don't play with it much anymore. Maybe they'll bat it once when they walk by... And not really the fault of the product, but the center cardboard scratching piece didn't have much appeal to them either. Maybe they're just picky..."
4,"Just recieved today, its great!","I just got this today and my cat has been playing on it quite a bit already. When we first put it out our dog was very interested and was batting the ball around with his nose, didn't expect him to play with it as well! We put it up where only the cat can reach it because our dog decided he would keep taking the ball out all for himself. Now that it is only in the cats reach she loves it, expecially with the cat nip sprinkled in the scratchy stuff."
4,An Excellent Primer,"I have just finished teaching a semester course on Mathematical Programming and Modelling with MATLAB. The students each obtained a copy of the book and I worked through the book with them. The book has very good exercises but I augmented these and, more or less, sat back and watched the students teach themselves in front of the computers. Some of the students had no programming experience at all. This text allows for that situation and gives good advice to the novice. All the students passed the exams, some with 100%. I have the exams as TEX files, if anyone is interested to see what the students can learn in thirteen weeks with the aid of this book. The book is slightly dated now and a few of the MATLAB functions, such as SETSTR, have become obsolete. Of course, this is not a problem and I recommend this book to both students and lecturers."
2,ChemE Undergrad view,"This book isn't bad, but it does leave a lot to be desired. I was hoping for a comprehensive desk reference on commands, syntax, and maybe even suggestions on strong and concise code for frequently used and frequently problemmatic routines (ie, iterations and for if elseif until stuff). If you are also looking for this, DON""T GET THIS BOOK. If you have some limited programming knowledge and just want to get an overview of Matlab so you can play with it, this would be a fine book. It's written so that it is meant to be used hand in hand with the often inscrutable matlab help files. But if you need a more authoritative source for lengthier and more difficult programs, look elsewhere."
3,"Nice introduction, very short on programming","The book is a nice introduction to matlab, yet it does not go very deep. A strength of matlab is its combination of mathematical tools with programming, I think. As such, I missed chapters on general programming, which would go further than simple functions or linear programming. For engineers and scientists, the issue of documentation and structure of a code is essential, as well.Straight to the point: It was helpful to learn the general syntax and get a first glimpse of matlab's possibilities, but I think I will not use it as a reference book in the future."
2,"Really bizarre, but not in a good way","I don't mind bizarre in a kid's book, usually, in fact, I love it---books with wacky pictures and weird ideas. However, the bizarre world has to have some internal reasoning and structure. This one doesn't. A girl, for no reason explained, decides to eat a TV for dinner. She eats it bit by bit, saving the remote for last, gets a little sick to her stomach, recovers, and then plans to eat her house. That's it. The pictures are detail-filled, but don't really add much to the story and don't have the kind of details kids notice or linger over. It doesn't bother me she eats a house or TV, but WHY? This is just pure out-there without any plot or reason, and my kids were just perplexed, not really interested."
3,Read it before bed. Have nice dreams.,"Light pabulum. Enjoyable like a marshmallow peep. And just as filling.It's quirky and funny and is a cross with Judy Blume adult fiction and some short story in a sci-fi monthly, though not too much of the latter. Actually, not enough of the latter. The whole issue is how TV has fractured the traditional ""Leave it to Beaver"" family unit (funny how when we think of pre-TV familiy life, we think of fake TV families from the 50s). But it really doesn't dealve too far into that and instead slaps a overly-happy ending on and includes a rather unrealistic drama involving a bb-gun."
2,"too convoluted equals failure, not extraordinary genius","Clearly beloved by reviewers, who were willing to take wordy, empty prose as mark of genius, this tiresome book was made barely tolerable by the movement from character to character in no definable order - and occasionally the characters were engaging for a few pages. The draw towards some kind of unifying conclusion or a return to those lucid intervals did carry me through to the unremarkable finale. Perhaps to those steeped in the English Lit department, the subtle references to classic novels would be enough to titillate, but as is I find this a definite first novel of an author who has promise that shines through in turns of phrase and character development, but whose verbiage and, perhaps, project for the novel overwhelm the end result."
5,A surprisingly delightful and entertaining novel!,"Labiner writes a complex, multi-layered novel that is surprisingly entertaining and funny. Although at times it is a bit confusing to keep track of the many characters, the novel is so compelling that one wants to get to know these people better. From the delicate Butternut to the main narrator (and herself an authoress) Pearl, Labiner has woven in a multitude of intriguing personalities. I found myself unable to put this book down! Our Sometime Sister would make a delightful beach read for the reader with a literary bent."
2,Too challenging.,"The inside cover sold me. Once I read half way through though, I was sure that I had picked a book with the wrong dust jacket. If you are soft to fiction about life in Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, this book is not for you. It is like a scavenger hunt, a constant search for clues, and answers. I didn't see the parallels at all. I read serious fiction, but this book is definately for readers of classic literature."
1,Audio but not for Kindle!,"I bought this book only because it is sold for Kindle and (I thought) featured audio. Too late I read: ""Kindle Edition with Audio/Video Audio/Video content only available for iPads, iPhones, and iPod Touch devices. "" I am disappointed...."
4,"5 stars for the book, 1 star for the CD","The phrasebook is very well done for a compact easy to carry reference book with phonetic pronunciation of a variety of very useful phrases when traveling as a tourist in Spain. Covering categories such as eating out, meeting people, getting directions, making purchases or reservations: even sports and romance. 253 pages of very well done helpful reference.The CD is no help at all. Although the Spanish phrases spoken on the CD are referenced to phrases in the book, the idea being you can see the phonetic spelling and hear the actual words, the phrases are spoken too quickly, with no time to repeat or practice, and are spoken by someone with too much of a Spanish accent.My advice, purchase the phrasebook separately and forget about the CD or the Audio Pack."
2,Audio CD was not great,Audio CD was not helpful to me. I felt that I could not listen to audio CD in a car while driving unless I could follow along with the book. I expected the audio CD to be more helpful while driving. The audio CD should have translated each Spanish phrase to English.
2,A huge disapointment,"Yes, this disc has some stunning music...about 2 minutes per selection of it. Sometimes a little more, but this is just a movement or so of each. I was thrilled to find Andrew Davis' version of The Polovstian Dances and found only a short choral section of it. It is a useful survey if you are a fledgeling listener to Russian classical music, but other than that, it is pretty useless for listening."
2,It's ok,This product works ok but who wants one big Krumkake?It doesn't cook as quickly as I would have thought.I would look elsewhere.
2,"Good Bible, but.....","I wish I had known before that there are a few pictures that were drawn inappropriately. One of Eve, of course--and one of Potipher's Wife, looking seductive, with cleavage showing and all. The other is of Mary, dressed in a low-cut, sleveless shirt. I don't think these pictures are appropriate for a children's Bible. The rest of the content is good and speaks to young children right at their level--but I don't like having to hide the above mentioned pictures from my 3 young boys."
3,Huh?,"This book was a quick read (I skipped most of the the long drawn long, drawn out predictable ""romance"") and somehow I decided to keep going. Then, I was surprised by the complex ending that finally was worth it. I wish the author would have concentrated or given more clues to the outcome, making it a good mystery rather than a ""love-story."""
2,Possible Ghost Writer?,"I have read many books by Sharon Sala/Dinah McCall and this one was a major disappointment. The writing was terrible. The clues as to the killer were so obvious, you knew who he was in the first couple of chapters. In addition, the phrase :Oh, My God"" and it's variations were used to express every emotion from suprise to disgust to dispair - over and over again. I had to force myself to finish reading it just to see if maybe I had been wrong about how the murderer was. Unfortunately, I wasn't. Sala has written so many good books but if I had read this one first, I would never have bought another one. I'm hoping she didn't really write it - that she used a ghost writer for this one."
3,Sala has written better,"Reading ""Snowfall"" I felt like I was in the middle of a series - with big chunks of the characters backgrounds missing. As a result the connection between the two main characters felt rushed. There was some good suspense, but it is not hard to figure out who the bad guy is PRETTY fast. Also the ending seemed rushed and like a bad patch up job- throwing in random bits of information to make all the pieces fit better.I have enjoyed Sharon Sala's books in the past and will continue to read her other books - this one just feel a little flat for me."
4,Excellent Read! Didn't want to put it down,"From the first page it kept my interest. Sometimes the herione (Catlin) annoyed me, but she was smart. But Mac(Conner) waz sexy & strong & smart. I would definately recommend this story! Excellent twist on the end!"
4,Snowfall by Sharon Sala (Hardcover),"Description from the book back cover:It's December in Manhattan. Falling snow blankets the city - and covers the body of a murdered woman that bears a special message from a twisted killer. High in her elegant apartment, bestselling mystery author Caitlin Bennett shivers in fear, holding the latest in a string of notes from a deranged ""fan"". No longer able to endure the growing terror alone, Caitlin agrees to hire ex-cop Conner 'Mac' McKee as a bodyguard. With Mac's protection, Caitlin begins to feel safe again. But when two more victims are discovered, each bearing a remarkable resemblance to Caitlin, they realize that she's the target. And that a deranged killer is now coming to claim his final victim ..."
4,A non stop romantic suspense,"Right away, the author pulls you into the story and instantly helps you to connect with the characters. The villian's thought process and motives are clearly projected by using a pseudo name leaving the reader to keep guessing as to the killer's true identity. To an avid mystery reader, the killer will be a bit on the obvious side, but still keeps you wondering if the author will shock you. There is plenty of sexual tension between the main characters, yet the romance is a bit on the weak side. The suspense is what continues to pull the reader along and for that it is a decent read. To intensify the excitement, try reading this book in the dead of winter when a snow storm is brewing outside. Living in the heat of Arizona doesn't quite capture the full effects."
4,Intriguing but not mesmerizing,"This was a good book and a definite page turner. Sharon Sala set up a nice mix of possible stalkers/killers in ""Snowfall"". I enjoyed it, but wasn't engrossed by it. I was able to put the book down for a week before feeling compelled to finish it."
2,Sharon has done much better,"I had to make myself finish reading this! All throughout I kept thinking this ""woman"" is an idiot. I really want my $8 back."
5,The Times Atlas of European History,This is huge find for me. It has the evolution of history as described by the migration of many peoples into a constant change on country boundaries.
1,False advertising,"Go download the trailer for this movie. If you're wondering what version, get the shorter one. I'll give you a minute.See that? That's all the best scenes in the movie. You've seen them. Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie. If you receive this movie as a gift, return it. I'm being harsh. There's a couple of funny scenes and jokes besides what's in the trailer, but for most of the time you watch this you'll be drumming your fingers and twiddling your thumbs waiting for something funny to happen."
1,Stupid,"Pretty much a bunch of potheads trying to find bigfoot. They try to insert some funny one-liners, but they aren't funny. I hoped that it was going to be a good movie, but it wasn't."
1,Never Received The Order,Ordered the dvd and still havent received it after a month. Contacted seller but no reply. Would not recommend buying from this seller.

1,90 minutes I'll never get back,"This is easily up in my top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. If you've never had a complete thought in your head (and I've been there) and are so baked that you won't even remember watching it (been there too) then you might get some chuckles out of it.This is pretty much random potty jokes (most of which have been used before) very very VERY thinly strung together by the storyline.Imagine the wost 2 dimensional, annoying character you've ever seen, clone him and you've got the cast of Strange Wilderness."
1,Disappointment.,"just like a few other guys here I was totally excited to see this movie when I first saw the trailer on TV. when I watched it there were a few funny scenes, alright. but when something is advertised as being hilarious and the funniest thing ever I expect a little bit more (especially because of the cast). overall the movie is just not entertaining, not funny. stupid is the word that comes to my mind. so don't waste your time and money and go buy or rent another one. cheers"
1,Strange Wilderness,"This movie shows how hollywood has fallen, its only for people that have only four walls to look at. Not funny, I wish that the cast would have said no, because the cast is great performers, but you can only entertain with what you have."
2,Didn't impress me,"I think I had higher expectations for this movie than I should have. If you're looking for a crude, mindless comedy - and trust me, sometimes I'm in the mood for those, I don't think they're awful - then this is probably a good choice. It had it's clever moments, but altogether, I just didn't find myself laughing very much. Maybe it would have been more fun if I had watched it with a group of friends. The plot, also, seemed really thrown together.There is one thing that almost makes this movie worth all of the bad stoner jokes for me - the laughing shark scene. I replayed that part four or five times, and every single time it almost brought me to tears. Actually, most of the ""documentary"" scenes were pretty good."
5,Funniest movie in a long time!,"I think these people giving this bad reviews are nuts! This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a VERY long time!! I laughed the whole way through...and I didn't expect much and was more then surprised. You have to appreciate these actors for what they are, it's simple as that. You can tell there is some improv, and it works well. If you take this movie serious and can't let your hair down, then you might not like it. Otherwise, keep your ears open because there are some great one-liners!"
4,A Flawed. but nonetheless funny movie.,"""Strange Wilderness"" is a Happy Madison film (Adam Sandler & Co.) that I believe does what It reaches out to do for the most part, be a simple, funny, stoner, wilderness movie. It stars Steve Zahn and Allen Covert as the two Main Characters, and a Slew of the good ol' faces we see in most Happy Madison movies (Peter Dante, Jonah Hill, Blake Clark, etc..) Strange Wilderness is the show that Peter Gaulke(Zahn) inherits from his once heralded father who passed away some time ago, and ever since Pete took over the show went downhill. With the show on two weeks notice Strange Wilderness Foils a plan to capture the much sought after Big Foot while trying to beat a rival Animal Show team to the punch. ""Strange Wilderness"" delivers a handful of Low brow laughs, especially Jonah Hill's ""Cooker"" character. It is worthy of a buy if you're into the type of comedy that is usually delivered from these type of movies."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"this is a ""challenging"" movie, mostly boring for the first hour, full of attempted ""dude"" moments that fail to make any of the characters likeable or relatable and barely even holding a thread of a plot, but it's worth rewaching after the last half hour puts everything into context by taking sharper more obviously deliberate wrong turns and proves it's not so much a failed attempt at writing a ""proper"" movie as it is a decent attempt at pure nonsense."
5,Great!,"Use these filters on the job. Used to get them at one of the big box clubs, however, they have quit carring them. Really glad to find them on Amazon, my new favorite place to shop!"
2,"Good filter, but why so pricey?","I have used these filters at the office for quite a while, and they are good quality filters. However, Sams Club sells them for $6.18. That's less than half what it will cost me on Amazon."
2,Commercial coffee filters,"The filters are good, but they ended up being pretty expensive with the shipping and handling. I'll probably do some comparison shopping next time."
2,"If you don't have a ""commercial"" Bunn...","I wrongly assumed a Bunn is a Bunn. We have a large Bunn coffee maker, but these won't fit. If it doesn't say ""Commercial"" it won't work. We can't find ANY that will fit correctly."
4,Why it happened the way it did,"This is not a book that describes what life was like for the men required to suffer in foxholes during WW II, rather it is an account as to how the decisions were made to place those men in foxholes and just where to place them. General Bradley does a fine job of describing the allied situation in North Africa, Sicily and France from the Allied commands perspective. As an aside to these discussions, he includes fascinating insights into his personal relationships and opinions of Montgomery, Eisenhower and Patton. These comments alone make this book a must read.You've read Ambrose's books regarding the citizen soldier, now discover the men who turned those citizens into soldiers."
5,A must read for military scholars,"I have just finished reading Gen. Bradley's memoirs and I would rate this as one of the top five books I have ever read. I am a military member currently stationed in England and I have visited many of the sites from WWII and I wish I had found this book previously because the plaques placed at the sites cannot express the true extent of the events that took place. The details listed in this book were given in a manner that made it easy to understand and process with the text. I felt that even though this was a history book that it read with the prose of a novel. I have read many history books on both the war in the pacific and in europe and have never seen a book that got into the why's of what was going on. Most books seem to stop with the what happened, who did this, etc. . . This was written with the soldier in mind and that is why I think it is a must read. You don't see enough books going into the whys."
3,Typical of the nouveaux Western-Arabic movement,"It's certainly not bad. But Majoun does not really surprise me either. As another customer said, it's reminiscent of Enya. I never really was very into Enya.This whole album is very ambient. Most of the time, it lacks a beat. The vocals are pretty, but don't say anything unless you understand ... arabic? The editing, as another buyer mentioned, is interesting, and especially so, on the first track.I'm happy I bought mine used."
4,"Yes, it's great for the price, but there one thing you should know","Only one ethernet port is active at a time.I read that the ethernet ports were ""switched"" thinking it had a built-in switching-hub. Wrong. It doesn't even have a hub. When you switch from one device to another, the internet follows, just like everything else.This is dissapointing. If you planned on having an Ethernet-enabled Tivo and another device that needs constant ethernet access (like a Nintendo Wii in sleepmode with ""WiiConnect24"") then this simply won't cut it. You'll need to get a seperate hub. Just think how easy it would have been to incorporate and how much simpler it would have made things. Oh well.Still, it's a great switch for a GREAT price, especially considering the advanced ports it's able to switch (Component, Optical, etc.)If you can handle buying (or don't need) a separate Ethernet hub, this is teh switch for you!"
4,Good Addition for Kayak Haulers,"It was my hope that these extensions would allow my wife to load her Perception Swifty kayaks by herself. We have a Ford Escape (yes, for those of you who are wondering - it is a hybrid), so the rack is fairly high, and my wife's not overly strong.While I find these VERY helpful for loading the kayaks, they're not a miraculous assist, and my wife is still not confident in doing it herself. It does take a good amount of caution in lifting the kayak up; you always have the feeling it could easily tip and fall off the extension.If you're not quite certain you could get the kayak up, even with this assistance, you're probably better off paying for one of Thule's more expensive 'lift assist' models.If you just need that 'little extra assistance' to load the kayak, these are great."
3,Confinement review,The premise was interesting and I did like the character development of the main character but most of the other characters read to me as stereotypes.
3,Four High-School Themed Lifetime Features,"""Surviving High School"" is a two-disc DVD set containing four Lifetime original movies focusing on the highs and lows of high school life for today's teens. The casts include familiar TV faces, such as Raven-Symone, David Charvet, Boti Bliss, Lisa Vidal, Sharon Lawrence, and Alexa Vega.""Odd Girl OUT"" deals with girl aggression and bullying.""Augusta, Gone,"" based on a true story, follows a teenager who spins out of control when she hits 15 and turns to drinking and drugs, big time.""The Perfect Teacher"" is about a beautiful spoiled girl with romantic eyes for her math teacher, who vows to see that they end up together.""For One Night,"" inspired by the real-life story of an African-American teenager who shook up a small town where high school proms had been racially segregated for decades, is about two women, a student and a reporter, who attempt to reverse the long-standing racist tradition."
5,"Gripping music, played with verve and intelligence","This is interesting, even gripping, music that stands on its own very well. It's atmospheric, without being necessarily programmatic. You don't have to have liked or even to have seen any of these films to be enthralled. Salonen and the Los Angeles peform it with verve and intelligence. After repeated listenings, I'm convinced that Hermann was a major composer, on the edge of but never in thrall to some of the leading movements in 20th century music. He was not a ""film composer,"" a term that still reeks of condescension, despite the fact that Prokofiev, Copland and Shostakovich all worked in the genre; he was an original and important composer who happened to write music for films. If Salonen brings Hermann's music some of the recognition it deserves, then he's performed a valuable service."
4,A real convenience,"I enjoyed the convenience of having all this in one handy place. The book is really an incredible reference, and I can't recommend it enough."
2,Borderline garbage,"Not only does this have ""puzzling omissions"" (6 Massenet operas -- no Manon!), but it lacks at least one important opera libretto (Verdi's Falstaff) that, according to the cover of the book, is supposed to be included! The libretti that are included have many cuts and errors, and the translations are poor compared to what you get in an average CD insert. It's like they compiled the cheapest, laziest translations available and passed the savings on to you. This would get my lowest rating, except that the price is right and there is obscure stuff in here that may otherwise be hard to find."
4,"Subtle, early ambient work","Thom Brennan worked with Steve Roach on WESTERN SPACES, and his collaboration with Steve has paid off in MOUNTAINS. Produced by Steve Roach for the Rubicon label, Brennan's work here is a subtle composition that proceeds like a aural voyage to a distant place. Slightly better than most electronic ambient works of its time. Develops slowly and gently, and builds to final ""march"" movement twenty-seven minutes long. (It was recorded 1986-87, and released in 1993 with a newly recorded bonus track, ""Monsoon."")"
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,"Thumbs up and a HUGE shout out for Ms. McCoy's first novel. She has some characters that you can't help falling in love and having hate for. You can relate to their situations and feel their joys and pains. There's some racy scenes she put in there, too, but it's all good.I hope she has a sequel coming out 'cause I want to know what happened to Tarell and Landi...This is a must-read for all book lovers!!!"
2,Beware - Does not include humidity sensor,"I gave my wife a similar Oregon Scientific Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer (RMR382A-BK) for Christmas. I wanted another unit to put in another room in the house, so ended up purchasing this unit -- it was only a little more money but had some cool extra features (humity, heat index, etc...). BUT this unit comes with just a wireless temperature sensor that does NOT detects humidity levels so the humidity percentage readout in the center of the screen along with the heat index and other features DO NOT WORK unless you buy a different sensor!! The manual tells you half the features do not work unless you buy a different sensor than is included and provides the model number (sorry, I dont have it, I already returned the unit with it's manual)."
1,This clock is a joke.,This clock doesn't even accurately tell time. Randomly some mornings It will be up to a hour off.
2,Pain in the Posterior,"Nice Looking, Compact -- Unfortunately works about as well as a Chinese (made there in fact) fire drill conducted by group of folks from the ""funny farm"".I own/have owned several Oregon Scientific products. All others while a bit difficult to program / operate have been reliable, this one is NOT!!!!About only thing that consistently works is the atomic clock. Even indoor temp requires resetting frequently. The remote temperature sensors only occasionally work with this unit, although another ""base"" unit works fine with same remote sensors and through 2-3 more walls.AVOID!!!!"
3,Atomic clock with inside and out side temp,The product is not what I was looking for. I wanted the combined inside and outside temp. displayed constantly. It is much smaller than what I thought it would be. I ordered 2. I haven't opened the 2nd because I want to return it.
5,Classic Christian Rock,"Anyone who enjoyed Dion as a fifties rocker will not be disappointed. My favorite is ""Man in the Glass"". Thanks Dion for spreading the gospel in a rainbow of musical styles."
4,Good Introduction to Entomology,"Dr. Pedigo's book is one of the better general entomology/ pest management textbooks that I have read. It is written in an understandable format and provides a good introduction to the structure, function, taxonomy, and applied ecology of insects. This volume is most appropriate for the undergraduate student interested in entomology although it would also be a handy addition to a graduate student's library as well. As with many introductory entomology textbooks, the taxonomic keys are very limited. I would recommend Borror, Triplehorn, and Johnson's: An introduction to the study of insects to anyone who desires a book with a good set of taxonomic keys."
2,Awsome,"Its an awsome Mp3 player, its really small and light- fits in your pocket easily.... The only down side is it takes a while to load songs onto it, but thats only a small part. Once the songs are on its great..."
4,"Great content, kindle version has issues","As a warning I have only used the kindle version, as this was my first experiment in using the kindle for a reference book.While the content and examples presented are great, the formatting on the kindle suffers from several problems, mainly when presenting formulas. They mistakenly have C instead of subset operators, leave off multiplication dots between numbers, etc. When there aren't mistakes in the format they suffer from some fairly obviously low res images for the formulas.I cannot compare this with the print version but I have not ever found a print book with all of these problems.I would be curious to know if this problem exists in many of the books or its specific to only this one. In any case be warned.So on content I give this 4 stars. On ebook presentation I would probably give it 2."
4,Dreams from the Past,"If you have ever wondered why you thought you could dig your way to China, watch these cartoons. Surreal yet truer to life than many sugar coated cartoons of today. Only 4 stars because it is missing the millions of mice that Farmer Gray used to chase at one time. Superb image quality for VHS and oh that organ music. A treasure."
5,Very good novel,"Through a very difficult childhood Charity faces many challenges. But eventually finds support and comfort in friendship. A very touching book, one of Lesley finest."
4,very enjoyable,this was a very good read as with all the lesley pearse books i have read so far i found it hard to put down
3,Heart warming,"Charity, the main character, portrays an overworked child in her family whose parents arevery eccentric. She is the oldest of 3 children.She finally gets a job, after a family disaster, in a boarding school cooking for boys.Due to misunderstanding with a beau she ends up in a facility for unwed mothers.The trial and tribulations of this young woman are very intense and interesting."
4,Hot Looking Bike Shorts,I like bike shorts and love how short and sexy these are. They fit good and show off my legs.
5,not for beginners,"I bought this book hoping to learn how to write but I have to let you know I knew nothing about writing. After buying other books on grammar and how to write I relise now this one is one of the best ways to improve your writing. Just have this in your collection, you'll be glad you did."
5,Good Tips,I do a lot of writing and am always interested in tips that make my writing better. This book does.
4,Great so far!!,"I haven't finished the book yet, but so far is great, really helping on my writing and easy to read and to apply. Really glad I have it on my electronic library!"
4,A Great Story,I read this book in one day i couldn't stop. It has every thing it's only flaw was the relegiousness it ruined the book for me
5,"A little slow in the beginning, but it picks up and is very interesting.",The action was a little slow in the beginning so I had a hard time staying with it. The action picked up fairly quickly and I started to love it.
5,One of the best.,I found out about this band through the old Appleseed Cast message board. After listening to the 3 tracks they had up on their website I was hooked. You won't find many bands like this out there. They're one in a million.
5,Great book,"I gave my book away, because it was such a hit with out of town company. I am here to replace it. The recipes in here are very easy and very good. Our favorites are Asian lettuce wraps, chocolate fondue, and the ever popular rings. This is a no fail book. Great if you need something impressive and easy for entertaining.Would also make a great gift."
1,"""Soft & Moist?"" HARD AS A ROCK!","I ordered some in June HARD AS A ROCK, had to ship pieces off for my dogs. NOT AS ADVERTISED. Surely this was an odd batch, Right? September, I fell for it again. You guessed it. HARD AS A ROCK. No point in trying to exchange for what they actually advertise THIS IS ALL THEY SEND. DISAPPOINTING."
5,Love At First Bite!,My family loves them. Two Yorkies and a Chihuahua are enjoying the Stix for the first time today.I snapped them in half because they are long enough for two servings and I don't want my wee ones to get pudgy.They are very similar in size and texture to Thinkers Duck Treats. But I wish they had the vitamins and DHA for brain function like Thinkers.I will buy these again for the wee ones.
4,"cute, feminine touch","I purchased this for my baby girl's nursery. It's nice, although a little steep in price I think. Cute with the fringe. It definitely looks better as an inside mount (to save money I used a shower curtain tension rod), as I tried it both ways. If you have the Libbie set or are using Central Park Toile in pink for a room (as I am) it is a nice alternative to a custom piece."
5,Amazing book for all ages,"Im 16 and an obsessive compulsive computer hobbyist, my friends keep bugging me to teach them about computers but I wasn't quite sure how. I just told them all to read so they bought books too advanced for them. I was in B&N and found this book, covers protocals, the TCP/IP layers, different kinds of servers (DNS, MX, NS etc.), heirarchial IP addresses and domains. Tells exactly how computers communicate in fairly easy to understand terms. A few typos but an excellent book. My friends dont bother me anymore, they know where to go on their own from here =)"
1,where is my exercise book?,"Package arrived without exercise guide, as outlined in ad. I have placed an email to company requestiong that they fulfill their obligation. I will not inflate the ball until I get the guide, as this may be a return item, if I do not get satisfaction. Will re-rate when transaction completed."
4,Another terrific Austin singer-songwriter,"In my parallel universe, the country charts would be filled with artists from Austin while Nashville pop/country would be just a footnote to country music. Sunny Sweeney is yet another Austin-based singer-songwriter that deserves much larger name recognition. Her terrific, powerful voice and honky-tonk attitude from another decade make for one great record. Love the songs, love the sound, love this album."
3,heartbreakers hall of fame (music),when i ordered this CD it told me that there was one song on here and when i received it the song was not there. i purchased this CD as a gift
4,Crucial Country,"I absolutely love Sunny Sweeney and this CD! The video for ""If I Could"" came across my path on YahooMusic one nite and I loved it. The CD has some tracks that are worth the 'price of admission' each by themself, including ""East Texas Pines"", ""If I Could"", and ""Next Big Nothing"". Great vocals, great pedal steel, strong guitar work. This album has revitalized my interest in singing again."
3,+1/2 -- East Texas twang by way of Austin's bars,"The munchkin-voiced Sweeney sounds a bit like her modern hero, Natalie Maines, but with a more straight-ahead country singer-songwriter vibe. Her East Texas twang meshes well with the steel/guitar/bass/drums of her band, and harmonica adds a touch of a 70s vibe. Sweeney's originals are smart and straightforward, ranging from the unhurried honky-tonk of the title track to the Lucinda Williams-styled ""Ten Years Pass."" The sassy, caller-styled hoedown ""If I Could"" features some hot-picking from the band, and her plaintive voice combines wonderfully with Jim Lauderdale on ""Lavender Blue."" Lauderdale's own ""Refresh My Memory"" and ""Please Be San Antone"" (the latter co-written by The Dixie Chicks' Emily Robison) and Iris Dement's ""Mama's Opry"" are finely selected covers. Sweeney's voice may not be for everyone, but her country heart is in just the right place. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2006 hyperbolium dot com]"
4,Perfect,"""A Simple Introduction"" describes this little book perfectly. It is a great platform to help you branch off into deeper studies of the Vedanta. The Vedanta seeks to unify humanity by looking at the common messages amongst other religious saints. A practitioner of Thelema will find that Crowley was obviously influenced by the Vedanta a great deal and thought very highly of its values and yoga practices when it came time to establish his own magical order called the A.'. A.'. I came upon Vedanta after spending some time studying Thelema and found its influence very great in my life although I never knew it by that name!"
2,Samples please,Is this worth the money? Don't have a clue. How does this sound? Don't have a clue. Can I return if I don't like. NO.
3,I'm Not as Impressed,"This disc collects three sinfonias, a suite and a concerto by J.S. Bach's eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann, who was a talented organist and composer but could never quite get it together as far as building a successful career was concerned -- I believe he died in poverty. These works, however, are certainly amiable and good-natured, and they are performed well enough by Tafelmusik under Jeanne Lamon. A cut above the great mass of 18th Century orchestral music, they nonetheless don't strike me as terribly compelling -- ""rememberable"" but not memorable. Among the Bach boys, I still prefer J.C. over W.F."
2,Rival CZF745 Stainless-Steel 4-1/2-Liter Cool-Zone Fryer,"Do not discard the original box until item is working for a while!This fryer looked good on the website, but was DOA when I got it, ofcourse after filling the machine with cooking oil. It was dead; nomanipulation of the controls could get it to heat. They sent me apre-paid UPS label for return, which was a nice touch. Getting thefryer back into the complicated packing box was tough, but I took mytime, and returned the item. Took about 3 weeks to get my credit, though.This fryer was much more cheaply made than it looked. I suppose $55 wastoo much to ask for a deep fryer. Would spend $100 next time, but I havedecided to stop eating deep fried foods anyway."
1,Rival Deep Fryer czf745 4-1/2 liter cool-zone fryer,I had bought this after having the same deep fryer for almost 6 yrs.Well needless to say after trying to use it the third time it was dead nothing i contacted the company only wanted them to send me a new heating element but was told they didnt make this deep fryer anymore...I did get a refund for my money 5 months later..
3,Frys Great just hard to clean,I would think any fryer is hard to clean. The lid is almost imposible to clean. But hot grease kills any germs. haha
2,WAY too small.,These bags are way too small for anything other than keeping your smallest pieces of gear consolodated. You can't even fit a poncho liner in the biggest of the three.
3,"mmm, not so great","the product is what it is, I thought the bags would be larger so I personally am disappointed, but I do not think the ad is misleading, it just did not have scale that I could follow in terms of the size of the bags, which were too small for what i wanted"
1,HATED IT!,"Like the other reviewers, it started out okay. Up into the part where he shacks up with another woman, and then gets her PREGNANT! The worst part is she was understanding and sympathetic!I would not be understanding, I would of felt a little better about the whole situation if she would have punished him in some kind of way, at least cussed him out or pimp slapped and didn't talk to him for the next century or so, but nooooo she had to forgive. Now Really, was she that hard up for a man. I was expecting happyendings in a fictional romance. Love the arthur, hate this book. One star for me, I'm trading this sucker in for a better read."
1,"More exploitation of American Indians, sad to say","Baker seems to use American Indian culture as filler between scenes of sex-sex-sex. It would be nice to see a writer really study Numuu (Comanche) culture before she tries to write about it, and I prefer to see heros and heroines make love to each other rather than other people. Can't recommend this one."
1,Awful,"He cheasts on her, but guess what? It's fine because he thought about her the whole time!!!!!!!!This is one of the worst books I ever read."
1,No information,This seller does not list what size sheet set this is and if it is one ply or two plys. How can anyone purchase this?
4,Chevy Floor Mats,The Floor Mats came in good time and they were exactly what I ordered. No surprises.
4,A must have,This book is a supplement to the First Grade Book by John Thompson and I am finding it to be a great help.
1,Windows 7 support defective,"The hardware may very well be acceptable, but the claimed Windows 7 support for this device is defective. The install disc simply exists saying ""your operating system is not supported"" but the m-audio has a Windows 7 (64 bit) driver. However after an apparently successful install (after which the device manager claims the unit is connected and working properly) every attempt to send sound to the unit causes the source application to hang. After much trial and error, I found that the unit will work if you go into the control panel, click through numerous dialog boxes and reset the unit to ""default"" configuration. The M-audio supplied control panel has no effect. After every reboot, the device is inoperable again and the time consuming reset procedure must be repeated.I don't know if the thing works better with other operating systems, but I'd advise anyone with Windows 7 to avoid this unit."
1,Great promise - awful driver support,"While the hardware specs on this device seem to serve a wide range of use cases (e.g. music production, audiophile listening on a laptop), the drivers make it rather annoying to use. The audio quality is quite good (when it is working), far better than any onboard audio system I've listened to. On multiple systems (vista 32-bit and windows 7 64-bit), one needs to go into the management utility, switch it into 16-bit mode, then run the audio test before any sound will play. Users need to repeat this process every time the system starts. This issue has been outstanding for quite a long time and support will give no ETA on a fix."
2,Great for Listening. But thats all,Good for mixing on the road but dont try recording through it. Quality is low and mine clicks and pops non-stop when using the input. But eventually the good output falls through as well. It's life expectancy is well under a year (and thats if u take real good care of it).
5,Great Product,"This thing does exactly what it's supposed to do. I bought it for my new iMac for add'l sound output options. The problem with a Mac is that it only has one sound output, and when you connect a cable to it you lose the onboard speakers. So I use the built-in digital audio on the Mac for AC3 passthrough to my stereo receiver (for watching DVDs), then I have this thing connected separately to a set of computer speakers on my desk. I even connected a stereo splitter so that sound goes to the local speakers AND goes to the stereo input of the receiver so that I can pipe music over zone 2 to some outdoor speakers (that won't work w/just the digital input). The moral of the story: it works perfectly and was well worth the $$$."
5,Works like a champ (home audio application),"I use an Apple Mac Mini as an audio server along with an ABUS whole house audio system, and was having some connectivity problems. I eventually found this little gadget, which I use as both a DAC and a splitter between the Mini, my receiver, and the ABUS hub. Works great."
2,"Great sound quality, but unstable and does not support newer operating systems","The sound quality is great. It has more complete I/O options than other small USB audio interfaces. But this thing does not seem to be treated seriously by the manufacturer, and is essentially ignored by its development team. It's been on the market for several years and has never had a usable driver for Vista. For a long time, they had a beta driver which was dangerously unstable and would not only fail to work but would cause sudden blue screen death of the computer. Three years after the release of Vista, they finally posted an official driver, but it could not be installed properly at all. I don't think the companies is supporting this product at all. So buyers be aware."
1,M-Audio Feedback,This product was returned as it did not meet my needs. The issue was due to very poor audio quality when playing back music to my home theater system. I have since purchased a simular product from a different vendor for half the price that works great..
3,Uninspired Origami Book,"The tittle says ""ultimate"" but the contents are far from it. There's a modest selection of traditional models and several weak original models. The diagrams are clear and easy to follow. This book is geared to the beginner but is so limited in it's scope and quality of artistic expression that it does nothing to kindle an interest in origami."" Origami Treasure Chest"" is a great book for beginners, with loads of fun models.Try ""Easy Origami"" by Montrol for similar models, or better yet get Honda's ""The World of Origami"", perhaps the best origami book available."
1,Very poor product,"The construction is cheap by today's standards. The inability to enter a phrase for translation makes it just about useless in the real world. The ""contained"" phrases are totally inadequate and translating one word at a time is impractical. While in Hong Kong I bought a Besta 9600 by Inventec. Light years ahead of Lingo. Quality of construction is the first clue. The ability to put in phrases in English and translate to the chosen language is superb. I can enter the foreign language (in this case Chinese, Korean or Japanese) characters with the stylus and translate them to English. Doing this I could ""read"" signs, menus etc. The Lingo was a complete waste of money."
1,Disappointing and returned,"I bought this translator to aid in my study of Japanese (I'm currently enrolled in the third year at my college as a graduate student). When I recieved it, it was made of fragile, lightweight plastic and I was worried it would break easily. It ate batteries way too quickly... One set was used up after playing on the translator for about one hour. It's translations may have been worse than looking them up. Many words spelled the same in Japanese (with totally different meanings) were translated incorrectly. I am really disappointed in the product, I returned it immediately. I am currently looking for a Sharp or Franklin brand translator."
2,not so easy to use,i really thought this would be a great learning tool.....the instructions are for rocket scientists....ever when you buy a home computer or entertainment system...they have quick basic set-up....it does not have many common words that people use each day in the memory.....maybe a very smart computer geek can figure this out....i am having much trouble learning how to use it.....thanks
2,Painful,"This was a waste of time and money. I found myself stuck in menus in other languages and unable to get out of the menus in order to actually use the different functions. Just take a translation phrase book along, you will be better off. Anyone want to buy mine? :)"
2,not very good voice reproduction,"The voice is not clear,very often not understandable,and very often speaks to fast. I would not buy or recommend this translator. I will mostly use it to look up word to find their meanings."
5,fantastic,"I love this documentary - it is a rare gem. It contains actual footage of Man Ray reflecting on his life/career. It also reveals his very early works as a boy in high school...unbelieveable. A must have for any fan of the ""Man""....E.M."
3,Puffin Jigsaw Puzzle,"As I purchased this Puffin Jigsaw puzzle as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter, I expected to receive a ""sealed"" box. The box is not sealed, has apparently been opened, and is wrapped with plastic tape. I purchased it as new but it won't be until after Christmas, and we have put the puzzle together, that I can be sure it IS new."
2,Can't get into it,"I am a huge reader, I love history, but I just can't get into this book. It's well written. Starts off pretty slow. I wanted to love this book, but couldn't."
4,"A Straight Ahead, Recommended Narrative Account","Frances Hill does what her subtitle (A Full Story of the Salem Witch Trials) promises. In a Delusion of Satan, the author tells the grippping and horrifying story from beginning to end in a fast-paced narrative that takes the reader through every pertinent detail. Along the way, she discusses motives, both psychological and material, that may have influenced the participants, as well as briefly glancing at the number of theories that have arisen in our more modern times. The author does not provide a large historical context in which to slide the events into, perhpas, but she does give just enough details to keep this story comprehensible and fascinating. The book does not dwell on modern analogies (they are too painfully obvious, at any rate). A recommended look at this terrible time."
4,"Detailed, informative, disgusting","For those of you who have always asked ""Why?"" when reading or discussing the Salem Witch Trials, this book is a paved road to your answers. Ms. Hill explores, in depth, the financial, political, and social motivations behind the chief accusers actions. The ""distinguised citizenry"", led by Reverend Samuel Parris and the Putnam family are exposed at last by well-documented and researched accounts that will shock and dismay you. Of course we have always known mankinds' propensity for inhumanity toward man, but this book brings those horrifying aspects into a much more clear and disturbing light."
1,An author with a more than obvious ulterior motive,"Francis Hill gives us a backlash attack on childhood incest and abuse in the guise of a book on the Salem Witch trials. She fails to stick to her stated topic and comes back again and again to her feebly argued case.She bases much of her analysis of the witch trials on guesswork that she calls common sense. She argues Tituba's morals are lax on the basis of the fact that Tituba was not a Puritan and not on any first hand accounts of her that have come down to us, for example. Her research is sparce, her thesis unproven. She fails to cite evidence for her claims.The main thrust of this book, on the rare occasions the author stays to her stated thrust, is a psychological analysis of the persons involved in and events leading to the Salem witch craze. Not only is the author not a psychologist, psychoanalyst or psychologist, she fails to consult such an expert relying instead on supposition and hunches.This book isn't worth reading."
2,Not what I thought it was...,"This smells like someone's agenda. Maybe living in Ann Arbor made my angry-radical-secular-feminist detector go off before I gave this book a fair shake, but this seems like a revision of the standard take on what happened. Probably a good read if that's what you're looking for."
2,Look elsewhere for history of Salem witch trials.,"Frances Hill presents a mildly entertaining but historically deficient analysis of the Salem witch scare of 1692. Focusing primarily on factional and familial conflict as the cause of the devastating craze, Hill neglects to give adequate attention to other, more plausible, explanations."

2,"Quite informative, but dreadfully boring","This book appears to be a well researched product, but it is very poorly written. In my opinion, an author needs to be a gifted prose writer to make a book readable and interesting. Frances Hill does not seem to possess that gift."
3,Berglund Center for Internet Studies Review by Jeffrey Barlow,"Like all massive edited compilation, Handbook of Computer Game Studies has something for almost everybody interested in its topic area, but much that will not interest any particular reader. The book, for me, is defined by its sheer size. It is in an 8.5 X 11 format, and has 27 articles extending over 450 pages. It is intended to be definitive as of its publication date in 2005. However, due to the inevitable lag in hard copy publication processes, it is probably better thought of as definitive as of 2004. This means, of course, in this very rapidly moving field, that some of the content has been outdated by much more recent publications on the web itself, or in more nimble hard-copy journals.For a full review see Interface, Volume 6, Issue 5."
3,Slightly off track,"I was excited to recieve this CD FREE with the purchase of a video. I am a massage therapist and LOVE Harmony by Michael Benghiat. Most of this CD is wonderful, however track 6 veers off course. It has a strong middle-eastern influence with lots of sitar. It's a nice track, but definately doesn't fit with the others and is disconcerting during a massage session. I've played it for family and tried it during sessions with a couple of friends, all have had the same reaction. If we could somehow skip track 6, it would be perfect. I would suggest hopping over to At Peace Media and sampling the cd, especially track 6, to be sure it fits your tastes and intended purpose. I highly recommend the Harmony cd."
1,"Battle overdoes the soprano; she is full of herself, phooey!","Everyone has sat in a church and listened to a soprano who is convinced that any music, from any culture, can be suitable embellished by her ringing, powerful voice. Battle falls into this ego trip on every song she sings; you can hardly tell Parkening is even in the church. Poor Chris, he must have been paid well to endure this ghastly affaire! Art Cloutier"
5,the most stunningly beautiful christmas album I have.,"Battle and Parkening are so synchronized in vocal and guitar. The result is a CD that is prayerful, thoughtful and so beautiful I've practically worn my cd out. I hope they collaborate again."
5,glorious encore presentation of Battle & Parkening,"For anyone who loved the earlier pairing of Battle and Parkening (""Pleasures Of Their Company"" -- a splendid album), this more recent CD will not disappoint. These are mostly Christmas songs, with some gospel material; the opening track (""Mary Did You Know"") and several of the exquisite Catalan songs are particular highlights. Battle's voice is in fine form, and Parkening's sensitive guitar accompaniment is perfect. Needless to say, I completely disagree with the previous reviewer's opinion -- can't help wondering if that person has an axe to grind. All in all, ""Angels' Glory"" is a lovely offering, guaranteed to provide much listening pleasure."
5,Great Four-Mile Workout,"I've been a Leslie Sansone fan for years. First the 1-Mile/2-Mile DVD, then the 3-Mile ""Walk Away the Pounds."" Yesterday, a friend introduced me to this ""Express 3 & 4 Mile"" DVD, which is different and WONDERFUL! I especially love the 4-mile workout. Very high energy, lots of fun, a good beat. This will take me to a new level of aerobic fitness! I also like the fact that no one is scantily clad. Clean, wholesome fun! Thanks, Leslie Sansone!"
5,Love it,"Such a great low price and it came with the stretchie band that I have been wanting! I love it and I love Leslie's workouts. Low impact, but gets the job done. You will be sweating without over working yourself."
5,I love Leslie Sansone Walk Away the Pounds! Lost 60 lbs,"I lost 60 lbs using Walk Away the Pounds combined with walking, hiking, bicycling - but Walk Away the Pounds is what I started with. She got me energized and more fit so I could go out there and be more active. I started with the simple 15 minute 1 mile, then gradually worked up from there."
5,More variety from Leslie Sansome.,"I have been using Leslie's other videos daily for about 2 years. I have lost weight, gained strength, coordination and balance, and really toned my arms especially. This DVD gives variety to your program using the bands. I use a different video every day and I am never bored. I would recommend her videos to everyone because even beginners can modify the walking steps to their level. It is like working out with a friend!"
4,"Strong, easy to follow workout","So far I've been very happy with every Leslie Sansonne DVD I've bought and this one is no exception. Her workouts are vigorous, get the heart rate up and are easy to follow. Don't be fooled by ""distance."" You get a great workout whether it's one mile or five miles."
3,I Expected Better,"I own Leslie Sansome's Walk Away the Pounds 1, 2, and three mile walks with weights (they use weighted balls, but I use regular hand weights). I liked the DVD's I had used of this system so far because they are easy to do and yet effective for boosting my metabolism. Since I am 45 and not really an athelete, they are good for me. I got this one because I wanted to try using the stretchie with the system for a different kind of workout. The Stretchie is a rubber resiestance band used for strengthening. The stretchie is only used in the three mile walk and even then for only about ten minutes. I wanted it for a bit more than that. I still like Leslie Sansome's Walk Away the Pounds system because its easy to do and yet effective. However, this DVD is misleading advertising because it really doesn't use the stretchie much or tell you much about how you could use it. I still think I will use this DVD for excercise though and maybe I will figure out how to use the stretchie on my own."
4,good workout but take note stretchie not needed for both,Please note the 2nd workout on here doesnt use the stretchie. Also (and I know I have seen comments on this before) but it finally happened to me. I now have the same workout repackaged differently. I have the 1st workout on here in VHS form & it's a green cover. I was hoping the 2nd one was a 4 mile with the stretchie but nope.I like the workouts especially the 2nd because she uses some new patterns including double kickbacks which I have never seen on her any of the others.Also the pacing is really nice on the 4 mile so you can get through it! Total time is about 58 minutes. So definitely worth it.
2,Disappointed,These two workouts are on another DVD that I own. I was looking for a different routine to give me some variety.
2,Keep your head covered...,The hood works great... for about ten minutes... then the plexi-mask see-thru is sand blasted and one can't see the project anymore. A good source of replacement plexi would be a good addition to this product.
1,Did NOT get what I ordered :(,"Be aware.. I bought this from ""US-Salon-Supply LLC"" thru amazon.. and I did NOT get what was pictured..I posted a picture as a reference..Disappointing and ridiculous that sellers get away with this sort of thing!"
3,Nice but...,"This wastebasket is nice but it is not as red as the picture looks. It did not match the furniture in the conference room I was wanting to put it in but I did find a home for it in our lobby. If you are looking for a smaller wastebasket that looks nice, then this one is for you. Just keep in mind that this is a lighter mahogany with more blonde tones than red."
5,A Treasured Gift,"When my wife and I were given a copy of ""Strangers from the Sea"" as a gift little did we know how excellent and thrilling a gift it would be. ""Strangers from the Sea"" is a fast-paced romantic adventure. Set in ancient times the story brings together the 9th century worlds of the Vikings and the Celts and takes us into their culture, travels, and history. Based on legend, ""Strangers from the Sea"" gives us strong characters; characters that we came to care about greatly. We felt their sorrows and joys, their struggles and triumphs. All this was aided by clever and believable dialogue. Whether you're interested in the legends, histories, and faith of these ancient peoples and lands or you want an inspirational story weaving together faith, hope, and love you should enjoy ""Strangers from the Sea."""
2,Magic Carpet Ride (mismatch),Amazon.com does not have the same version as YouTube. All versions of Magic Carpet Ride on Amazon are missing the Latin trumpet melody as part of the groove. The trumpet melody is my favorite part of the song! What a bummer.
3,Energy in a bottle,The product promotes natural energy and helps me throughout the entire day. I even sleep better at night since I've added the Natrol Acai Berry caps to my daily diet.
2,Didn't work well for me,"This product didn't work great for me. I followed the directions completely without any success. In defense of the product, I have a very difficult system and constipation is regular part of my life. It probably would work fine for the ""normal"" person."
1,THIS ITEM IS RIP OFF,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP IT DOES NOT WORK I TRIED IT EVEN USED MORE THAN RECOMMENDED DOSES STILL DID NOT WORK
5,Works quickly,best price great options for fast shipping and readyness a must have for those who need a deep cleansing.
1,DVD,"We order this for are grandsons 3 months ago. We have not gotten them but the money was taken out of my account!Tried to find the main wed site to find out could not find,Very disapointed!!!"
2,Item not as listed,"Disc was scratched beyond viewing capability and case was very tattered.Item was listed ""good"" condition, however I do not agree with their description"
4,A comprehensive and fascinating look backstage.,"The cost of Broadway musicals in the 1990s was so astronomical that when shows succeeded, they succeeded big. And when they flopped, they flopped even harder. Big was one of the latter. And, though this book often feels like it wants to paint the opposite picture, from the trials and tribulations it covers, when you've finished it, you know why it's failed. Most of the book is wonderfully informative and well-written, but the show's lingering death is glossed over in a very ineffective epilogue, and its post-Broadway life is not even discussed at all. If you are at all interested in how Broadway musicals are conceived of and produced, you shouldn't miss this book."
5,Can't Beat The Price,"Great price for this compatible cartidge that is quite expensive as an original. It works just as well as original Lexmark ink. I'm still using it, so I can't speak to how long it lasts or how many pages it prints."
3,are you a die-hard Greco fan?,"This live CD definitely does not convey Greco's best voice. The piano, violin, accordion, and other instruments are your standard Greco backups, but overall the album is sort of flat and tired. Better brush up on your listening skills--there are no lyrics or juicy tidbits in the liner notes, and no redeeming photos either! Still for the die-hard Greco fan, there is something here you can't find in the polished versions with some new variations."
2,save your money,"Made of a soft steel, the legs' attachment is a bit flimsy, so it leans forward too much.May not accommodate bikes with disk brakes (the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening). I had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26"" mountain bike."
1,Not so portable. Flimsy,I bought this rudementary bicycle stand. It is not portable or quick to set up. It wobbles and flimsy. It has a hard time holding up my bicycles. More so with my mountain bike.
1,didn't get all the parts,I bought this for my a Christmas present and parts were missing and I still do not have them
3,It's a quick fix,Not the greatest product but it does the trick if you don't have the big bucks for a professional stand
1,Can I get my money back?,"This poorly written, thin little paperback cost [too much]. It doesn't matter how good the content may or may not be, because while reading it your mind is on how such a terribly written book ever made it to print. There are major mistakes on every page of this book, and in almost every `chapter', I was left wondering what the authors point was. I love all books and would never think of a refund on one... but this is beyond bad. Also, the two positive reviewers on this page are from the same town as the author. Friends or Family?"
4,A must read,"This book is a must read for anyone wanting to get into the feild, and a great education for those who are just curious."
4,Getting Harder to Find,"The execution of Bach's work is technically well performed. What I found amazing was that, even on Amazon, this was one of the ONLY recordings of the Goldberg Variations played on harpsicord. The piece was originally wriiten for the harpsicord, but it seems to be quite in vogue to transcribe his orignial work for various other instruments. I have nothing against that trend, but I would like to see more faithful recordings of the work on the instrument for which it was intended."
5,This is a wonderful audio lesson,"P. Chodron is a gentle, wise teacher with a profound sense of humor. I listen to these cd's over and over w/o ever tiring of them. I have downloaded them into my iPod so they are mobile, I like them that much! Her work is a strong reminder to breathe. Not to mention the fact that her voice is so lovable."
5,review,Very satisfied with the product. Good savings.Arrived very promptly and in exceelent condition.
1,Suction Blaster,I was able to operate this unit intermittently. I could not figure out what conditions were required to make it operate reliably. Finaly I gave up and bought a pressure operated unit (not a suction unit).
5,Victorias Step & Shape Workout VHS,The first time I ever found an exercise I love to do and would stick with it was in 1995 with this vhs my friend let me borrow. I found I could always fit this into my schedule and enjoyed it every time. It was difficult at first but after a month my weight decreased and my energy soared. I had all the information to order this but the company had moved with no forwarding. I searched and searched even signed up on her blog and sent her an email about this. She did not reply. I had ordered several other exercises of hers but it was not the same. I am so glad I took the chance and didnt give up. The picture on the front is not the one in the video so I am pleased to say I am more then happy with this video and she should really put it on a DVD and sale it.
1,Worse then the first one,"A freind of mine bought this game the year before and I eventully borrowed it from him and played it through. there was no graphics improvment from the first one, thier was no blood, the game was shorter (or so it seemed) and it was not as challenging as the first dezert storm, and the vieraity of missions were not as fun and exciting as the first one was,(Almost all of the missions in back to baghdad are Urban city combat no Dezert rural combat) and the sound track was just Lousy! if u havent played the first one, Dezert storm back to baghdad is a decent game but I would strongly Recomend buying the first conflect Dezert storm instead.(all the Conflect games including Back to Baghdad are 3rd Person shooters)"
2,hubby likes it,"Not much fun for me, maybe because it is mmy husband's game, and I can't get him off the computer anymore."
4,An old game thats still fun.,"Most old games are kinda shit by todays standards, the controls feel weird and graphics look blocky. This game manages to transcend that aged feeling by having solid gameplay and the perfect amount of micro for your squad. The gunplay is fast and hectic, there are plenty of ways to flank and have take down the enemies without taking any damage and that feeling is what makes the game great. Bad parts/ annoyances: Some keys need to be rebound, and mouse acceleration needs to be turned off, but as a pc game you can do that. Some gameplay issues like no autosave, no quciksave, large invisible model edges making corner sniping hard, you really need to pay attention to the range finder in the scope or you will hit an invisible part of a model. Right click goes into first person, which is what I play in, and they dont draw any gun/item models."
1,Don't buy.,"For some reason, after loading for so long did not work on my computer. Very old version as well and does not work on any younger than XP versions of windows."
3,Mine was delivered broken,"Plain Frame. Okay for poster. I just bought one to frame a free Nationals poster so did not care too much on what it looked like or anything. The border of my frame was fine, but the clear plastic (glass) was broken in 3 of the corners. Again, not a big deal for me....seeing as I was framing a free poster. I just put some ticket stubs in the corners to cover up the broken plastic rather than sending back a $20 frame."
3,"silvery, yet needs more secure techniques","The selections of of the arias are perfect to show off Ying Huang's silvery beautiful voice. Pleasant to hear, but her high notes are not so secure. If you really want to experience what truly beautiful belcanto arias are all about, check out ""belcanto"" album of ""Sumi Jo"", world's most exquisite coloratura queen."
3,Competent lyrical soprano from China.,"Talking about current Chinese lyrical sopranos, people tend to focus on the internationally famous ones, like Ying Huang, Liping Zhang.My personal favourite is certainly Dilber Yunus.Ying Huang has a very nice timbre, however, as one reviewer so aptly pointed out, technically she is not in the same league as Dilber.She is most suited to the classical lyrical repertoire like Mozart, Schubert or Haydn. As for bel canto, she does not have the range, or the coloratura technique.Absolutely not for Verdi or Puccini, given that her 'Madama Butterfly' was a film and not a stage performance, she neither has the fach nor prowess to tackle that role.She will craft a successful career by sticking to the strictly lyrical repertoire. In this respect, her timbre is more akin to Lan Rao, who focuses on lieder, and who possesses a much sounder vocal technique than Ying Huang."
4,Sound and Picture review only,"There is enough written about the film, so I am just going to state my views of the technicalities of this version of the DVD since I couldn't find a review about the Immortal Edition.I must say that the picture is much improved from the director's cut edition. However do not expect it to be state of the art. You can still see at times the grains but it is much more superior that the director's cut.In terms of sound, the DVD boasts the DTS-ES system. Now that is state of the art. However, since this is an old film the sound cannot be compared to the Gladiator and Seven discs.This is the best version of Highlander that is available. I should know I have the director's cut version. A bit pricey though. I think for that price they should at least include a ""making"" documentary. All in all, I would truly recommend it to my friends if the price within the region of USD 20. I think we can do away with the Queen CD!"
1,same disc as before...NEW cover art only ....stick with what you have!,"Hi folks,I admit it...I love this movie...I saw this at my local shop (dvd planet) and couldn't resist... Directors Cut..6 more minutes! I got a sick feelingn when I put it in my player and the SAME menu as the previous edition came up... Turns out to be the same as previously released with a new cover. If you have the previous release...do NOT buy this.lets hope a Blu Ray edition with some real bonus features will happen eventually. My 1 star rating is for this hopeless retread in packaging NOT the excellent movie!"
2,Terrible Quality,"I don't understand why this was given a 4.5 on quality. It's terrible. It was the first disc I bought after I got the player and I thought my new DVD player had a problem. And the disc is not 141 minutes, it's 116 minutes. I loved the movie, but my VHS copy is just as good as this."
2,Ack! This is a DVD?,"Mirroring the comments of others, while Highlander is a great movie, the picture quality of the DVD is simply awful - so much so that it detracts from enjoying the film itself. Stick with the VHS version."
1,Great movie...the WORST DVD,"I love this movie and was excited that it was issued on DVD. What a disappointment! The video quality was beyond terrible, rife with artifacts and breakup. The resolution was worse than you'd see with a 20 year old tape on a 20 year old VCR. The AC-3 was uneven with erratic volume levels that rendered the dialogoue inaudible at times. Don't waste your money on this bottom-of-the-heap DVD!"
1,The worst DVD I have ever seen !,"The resolution of this DVD is very, very poor ! Even a VHS is better than that. If you want to convince someone not to buy DVD, just show him (her) this DVD ! END"
2,A great movie with a bad conversion to DVD,"Highlander is a great movie, and the Director's Cut only improved it. BUT, the conversion to DVD is only half complete. The audio is incredible, one of the best sounding movies I have heard through my sterio. The video on the other hand looks more like early computer video that looks good in a small window and bad in full screen. The video is always grainy and you can actually see rectangular blocks of solid color in many scenes. Instead of seeing a movie in over 500 lines of horizontal resolution, it often looks like 100 thicker lines on parts of the screen. In watching the movie I could almost get beyond the video quality, but it definitely detracted from the movie. END"
1,"Great Movie, Terrible encoding job!!!!!!!!!!","If you like this movie, don't but it on DVD go out and buy something better, the VHS. Even though the disc is encoded with 5.1 sound, I could not get passed the terrible visual experience of the DVD. It looks as if they copied the picture straight from the the copy of a copy of a VHS taped from TBS!!!!!!! END"
1,I should have read the other reviews,"This DVD is of such poor quality, I can't believe it was released. Pitiful video and audio.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"
5,WOW! I'm Impressed,I received this product in a timely manner and in the condition it was advertised as. I would purchase from Amazon again.
4,Finally Found It.,"I have been looking for Highlander ( first one ) love this type of movie. But could never find it. Bought Highlander 2 some time ago. When I found it on Amazon and being in widescreen ( which I only buy widescreen ) I got it. The movie is just what it is. Action with lots of sword play. The ""bad"" guy is a little overdone but what the heck, It goes along with the theme of this type of movie.Anyone who liked this movie should buy the the 2nd version."
2,Worst waste of money i EVER spent on a rental,"I got into the whole Highlander scene watching the series on USA. I was so hooked i even watched the animated series, but this was absolutely awful. This was just a paycheck for Christopher Lambert, he didn't put any pizazze into this character at all. I found myself wondering what had posessed me to rent this in the first place. The sword fights were even bad, i mean its just sword action, can't go wrong there i would think. I wouldn't watch this again if it was the only thing on at 4am during and insomneia fit."
2,THX Certified? You have to be kidding!,"This is not the first THX-certified movie, but positively the worst. If it wasn't for the movie itself, I'd rate this DVD with a lot less than even one star. Even Queen's audio track sounds awful, a lot worse than the same tunes on ""A Kind of Magic""! If THX is trying to market its ratings as quality trademark, they just invited a lot of competition to join this field... Watching this DVD is like reading a book that you really like, but it's full of coffee stains and plum jam fingerprints. Ouch!"
5,Good Movie. Plenty Of Swordfighting.,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.This film is pretty good, from the swordfighting to the musical score by the always reliable Michael Kamen. The acting, from Christopher Lambert to Sean Connery, is also excellent. I recommend it. I'm now interested in seeing the Director's Cut of the movie. Watch for a quick appearance by stunt coordinater Peter Diamond, who choreographed the fight scenes in the first three STAR WARS films, The Princess Bride and would go on to be the stunt coordinater (& guest star, for two episodes) of the Family Channel series Zorro, which aired from 1990-1993. This film should have been rated PG-13."
2,The Highlander,"The poorest image quality I'v yet seen on a DVD. Sound was decent but the video transfer from film to DVD is truly poor. Viewed on a 53"" Sony RPTV. Poor image would be much less noticeable on a 27"" or so tube TV."
3,Nice re-issue,"This is a cult classic. I have always loved this movie. My only complaint is that here and there the audio drops out, causing one ""quiet"" line to be heard, and the next to be difficult to hear, even when the volume is turned up very high."
3,"Good movie, low quality.","This is a good action scifi. Lots of action and the story has a good flow. However, the picture quality is poor. I expect better from a DVD."
3,Highlander DC version,"Good movie, horrible sound quality. This is nothing that people haven't said before, but just to elaborate a bit more. The sound cuts in and out. Half the time, you can't make out what the actors are saying and there is no cc for English. The other half, the music and fighting is so loud that you have to turn the volume down. It's cheap to buy, but go for a better copy even if it's a bit more."
1,worst transfer ever,"This Republic transfer is worse than VHS, worse than Beta, worse than broadcast tv on a CRT (for those who remember that); it looks like the picture was shot through a pebbled glass table. And it's in standard letterbox format. Pass, pass, pass."
5,Amazingly good,Considering this was bought for my son and we watched it together I even liked it. He said see Mom I knew you would like it too.
5,Great Movie,"Going back and watching the original movie again, but in Blu Ray this time was a great experience."
4,Immortal Combat...,"HIGHLANDER was one of my favorite 80s movies, along w/ THE TERMINATOR, ALIENS, PREDATOR, ROBOCOP, etc. Watching it again last night (after 20+ years), I noticed the 80s cheeeez-factor in full swing. Some of the dialogue is laughable, the action is stilted, and the story is somewhat hokey. Still, I love the flashback sequences in Scotland, as well as any scene w/ Clancy Brown's eeevil, behemoth character! He pulls off his role w/ gloriously demonic glee. He's the most interesting / exciting thing about the movie, especially when driving a stolen car maniacally or offending nuns in a church! Sean Connery is also good, while Christopher Lambert is mostly a wood by-product, especially when speaking. HIGHLANDER remains fun to watch, as long as you don't mind a bit of goofiness..."
3,"This is not the ""Only One""","This movie is my guilty pleasure.I read poor reviews about the sequels so I haven't seen any of them.I guess they couldn't get Mulcahey.Folks, the picture quality is just not good enough. Think VHS not Blu-Ray."
3,Highlander,"This is by far NOT the best made movie, and it's very graphically violent. I bought it for the music when I learnd that Queen wrote the entire score for it and a few of their biggest hits came from this score (Who Wants to Live Forever is beyond description!)."
3,Get what you pay for...,"Believe what the reviews are saying. This DVD is of noticeably bad quality, with a grainy, pixilated image. It distracts from the enjoyment of the film, and the VHS tape is of higher quality.That being said, at a mere $7, this DVD is worth the purchase. Highlander is a great film and the directors cut adds some interesting, if not always high quality, footage. There is a reason the WWII scene wound up on the floor. But it is still fun to watch. The production stills are nice, and you get to see some of the famous ""lost scene"" of the Asian immortal. Other DVD extras justify the small price tag, with an audio commentary by Russel Mulchay.I enjoyed it, but I would have felt robbed at full DVD price"
3,I Got The DVD,"THX?.....I have a copy of a few DVD's that are THX quality. Alien (box set), T2, but this is the worst DVD transfer i have ever seen. It not 16x9, but i knew that when i bought it. The sound is good in some areas and worst in others, the picture is about the same you can even count the dots on the film in areas if you wish....bottom line buy it if you have to."
3,cheese at its best !!!,"i use to love this movie...but seeing it for the first time in about 7 years, i realized how cheesey it is. don't get me wrong, it's a very nice story, but this movie could have been much better. the world war 2 scene added in the director's cut is absurd (kind of like a bad 1970's action movie) the plus side to this movie is the photography work. the transitions from past to future are very creatively done. and so on. this is probably the best bad movie i have ever seen. the dvd seems fine though. the sound was a bit questionable in places, but the picture quality is top-knotch."
1,"Great movie, Unacceptable DVD!","Highlander is one of my favorite action adventure movies. My review is not about the quality of the film, it is about the Horrible lack of quality of the DVD version.Simply put, the DVD is unwatchable. The image is constantely shimmering, and full of artifacts. The company must recall these unacceptable DVD's and remaster the movie professionally. How dare Republic pictures/Lumiere distribute a poor product like this."
4,"Dont be scared, its a decent copy","After hearing several reviews of dvd versions of the film I was terrified to purchase any but went with it anyhow. I'm a film freak as well but the quality of the release is acceptable. Its not like they filmed movies back then with crystal clear High Def cameras with 7.1 speaker setups in mind! And who knows what the requirments are for a full digital restoration. You've got to cut it some slack considering the time and budget it was filmed on.I didnt see it in the theatre so I can't make version comparisons but it is just like I remember seeing it on tv as a kid(minus a scene or two). Its a bit goofy, but its no goofier than any film from that period or any worse quality.If you remember it from way when or are another Sean Connery fan, go with it, its worth the couple bucks. If you've never seen it then dont get it with expectations of it holding up to this years films. Overall worth what I paid!!"
1,Terrible Transfer,"This is the worst transfer I've ever seen on DVD. It is a shame that such a great film, and has been ruined."
4,Would Give It 5 Stars But......,"I love this movie, I originally watched this for the first time in the theater when I was a teenager and loved it. I bought the VHS, then the DVD, and now this BD. Taking into account how dated this is, and some of the bad editing, this movie still is entertaining and I love the characters. The one issue that I've always disliked was the tinny and grating soundtrack. I don't know what they used to record it but it sounded to me like it was done on the cheapest equipment you could find at the time, that's why I took away one star."
5,Great quality,I finally ignored many of the reviews and got tired of waiting for whatever Blu-ray version that may one day exist and bought the DVD and to say; the music is excellent and also nothing at all wrong with the DVD quality. Sure not 1080p quality but fairly good for DVD.So much so I can now say I proudly own all of the 6 seasons of the TV series and all of the movies. The original Highlander movie finally convinced me to finish off the collection and to have all of them.Great to see the original again and I had forgotten so many things and it was great to see how it all began. I told recommend this edition!!Highlander (The Immortal Edition)
2,"Great idea, weak execution","Highlander is one of those good ideas that never works because of disastrous directorial miscasting. Attention-seeking video director Russell Mulcahy seems almost perversely determined to make the wrong choice in almost every scene, whether its his obsessive use of inappropriate long lenses or his determination to make every shot so distinctive that he never notices that not only do the pictures often play against the intent of the scene but half the time the shots don't even match. He's not much good with actors either, constantly spinning off into clumsy broad comedy that undermines any threat or momentum, with Clancy Brown's evil Kurgan the main casualty as he is reduced to a tiresomely comical punk rocker. It may be the best of the series, but it's a long way from being even nearly as good as it could and should have been. One film that's practically crying out for a remake with a decent director."
3,"Good, Bad, and Ugly","THE MOVIE: Who listens to critics? Ignore the bad reviews written at the time of the theatrical release (1985). The plot is original and suspenseful. The action is well-executed and never overdone. The camerawork is incredible, as are the scene transitions. Sean Connery and Clancy Brown really bring it home, acting-wise.THE DISC (DVD): Get the tape. You're just wasting your money by getting this movie on DVD. The picture is grainy; 30-year-old movies have been remastered better than this one. The sound separation is mediocre, and the editing is terrible: expect to turn up your stereo twice as loud for dialogue, then half as loud for action scenes. Compared to the DVD, the tape is 99% as good at 66% of the price. For these reasons, I took a star away from my review of this DVD."
1,I've Seen Home Videos With Better Picture Quality,"Now, don't get me wrong. The film is very good. It has a lot of action, humor, and some 80's cheese, but the DVD is almost unwatchable. The picture is more granier than the VHS version. This is, hands down, the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen. Please, do not waste your money on this DVD. The cover says that this DVD has THX certification!?!? Yeah, right, and so does the video that I filmed of my family opening Christmas presents last year."
2,DVD = Digital Video Distortion,"This is the first DVD I purchased after buying my DVD player. I almost returned my DVD player because I thought that all DVDs were going to have the same compression artifacts and pixelation that this copy has. I wish I would have found all the opinions posted here before I purchased this DVD. I probably would not have bought it. One thing good to say about it though. The color is great and the sound - although recorded at a low level - is superior to the video tape version (only a slight hiss). I agree, with other reviews here. This should be recalled and replaced with a version worthy of the supposed high-quality THX certification. By the way, as movies go, this is one of my cult favorites."
5,A wonderful movie!,"This is a classic flick for those that like good fight scenes and especially sword fighting.This film takes you through the lives of several ""immortals"" but one Highlander in particular. They pass through the centuries occassional battling each other in their quest to be the last immortal alive. The fight scenes are excellent and the bad guy is simply delightful!I found the DVD to be a bit lacking but for the price you can't beat it."
2,A classic movie ruined on DVD!,"I first saw this movie years ago when I rented it on video. I really enjoyed the movie. Highlander is really a cult classic. I just got a DVD player for my birthday and bought this 10th Anniversary Edition on DVD. Man, what a let down! The picture quality is terrible! The movie looks grainy and has little white specks flickering throughout the movie. Plus the sound quality is lousy. I have never seen such poor quality in a DVD! Don't waste your time buying the DVD. If they do another edition on DVD, they need to go back and do a better job! Go and buy the regular Director's Cut on VHS. It's a waste of money buying it on DVD."
2,Hard to see what all the fuss is about,"The premise is, indeed, very cool -- but the execution just seems very off. Clancy Brown has delivered much better performances than he does here, and it's hard to take him seriously as the main villain. The character development in the flashback sequences is OK, but it makes no sense why anyone does what they do in the modern era, and some of the dialogue is just ear-gratingly bad. Worst of all, though, the gathering itself just doesn't have the sense of drama you'd expect it to. There doesn't seem to be much of a sense of urgency to any of the characters, and that makes the film itself seem kind of slow.I was also disappointed by the film quality, as I think other reviewers have observed . . . haven't really looked at the other DVD extras, but I don't see them overcoming the general disappointment I had in the movie itself."
3,It really is great.,"Granted, the storyline is a little hokey, and the camerawork could have been better, but what most people refuse to remember is that this movie was made in 1986! Nobody ever accused movies from 86 of being the best there were. The storyline definitely is good and for any Highlander fan they'd find nothing better than this version of Highlander to watch. The added scenes make the story flow a little better, and short of getting the LD or DVD for the full directors commentary, it's the only place where you'd get to find out the story behind most of the scenes."
1,This DVD blows!,"The movie is good, but this is without a doubt the WORST looking DVD I have ever seen. The picture quality is horrible and completely unwatchable. AND IT IS THX, WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?"
4,A great epic tale with astounding narration...,"This film may not accomplish much in the long run, but the phenomenon is spawned is outstanding. We meet Russel Nash (Christopher Lambert) at a wrestling match where he leaves to the parking garage and gets into a swordfight with a strange man in a business suit. Soon after, we're thrust 500 years ago into the highlands of Scotland, where we learn that Nash is really Connor MacLeod, an immortal being who is banished from his native land and accused of using satanic magic. He then encounters Ramirez (Sean Connery), who teaches him the ways and rules of immortals. From there, the story unfolds into an epic so different from anything else Hollywood has to offer. The overall story itself is a moderate romantic adventure, but the swordfights and camera work as well as original music by legendary band Queen make this film a rollicking good time. A must-see for all action and fantasy fans."
1,"An all-time favorite movie of mine, Worst DVD transfer EVER.","Funny that mjkobb said in his/her review of this DVD that it may make you think something was wrong with your player... I actually bought this disc at the same time I bought my player... And I was horrified, HORRIFIED by what I saw. Worse, by far, than even my well-worn VHS copy! I actually had to go rent some other DVD's to make sure that it was the disc, not the player.I was very pleased that subsequent rentals and disc purchases showed me that it was merely a bad transfer. Highlander is one of my all-time favorite films, but the DVD version is so bad that it looks like it was edited by a five year old with a box of crayons. This disc needs to be redone... And the only way I can recommend you buying it is if you have very bad eyesight or if it is cheap. REALLY cheap, like five bucks."
1,Stay as far away from this one as you can!,"Since everyone already knows that Highlander is a great movie, and since the Queen sountrack is entirely a matter of taste, I will limit my comments to the technical quality of the DVD.In short, this is the worst DVD I've ever seen. The picture is so grainy and noisy you feel like you're watching your local 'B' grade television channel. The compression artifacts are terrible. A disgrace, and a total waste of money."
2,Poor quality DVD,"If you really like the movie, can get a good deal on it, and won't be paranoid that your DVD player is on the fritz, then buy it. The picture is worse than a typical new VHS tape, but the sound is 5.1 (though only fair in quality)."
3,very disapointed,"Usually when you see ""directors cut"" one thinks a ""better"" or with deleated scenes etc. In this case, I think they had a good reason for deleating the scenes they did. In some DVD releases you get a choice of seeing it in the ""original"" theatrical version or ""directors cut"" with the new added portions, but in this case they didnt and I wish they had. I started to watch the movie and was disapointed with the first ""duel"" in the parking lot. I dont remember the dozens of ""backflips"" that Connors opponent makes, over and over again. One moment hes flipping without his sword, the next the sword is amazingly there? Oh well, for 6.99 I guess if I had rented it, it would have cost me about the same. I'm hoping they bring out a special ""ultra"" collectors (blah, blah blah) like they do with some of the oddest titles, with a choice of versions."
2,"The movie was way too cheap, now I see why!!!!","The picture looks terrible, grainy, with specs flickering like it was a much older film. Sound in a Dolby Pro Logic system is terrible as well.(I understand this is not the case in a Dolby Digital system)I have other THX DVD's that look and sound fantastic, not this one!!!!Don't let yourself be fooled by the THX endorsement it is not an absolute guarantee."
1,"Poor film, worse DVD","I fall into the ranks of those bitten by a nostalgia bug. I first saw this film right after college and remember loving it. I suspect that had more to do with the group of friends with whom I saw the movie than the movie itself. At least I hope that is the case. The acting is horrific and the film just doesn't hold together. Too bad they didn't hire a choreographer for the fight scenes. Pathetic. My teenager says he now has confirmation that I have zero taste in action films.As far as the DVD itself goes, it was noisy in the machine. The sound was at times too low to be heard, and at other times too loud for comfort. The picture was grainy and often much too dark. At least running the volume control up and down gave us something to do while watching it.After the credits ran, we threw it out. I don't recall doing that with any other DVD I have purchased. I suppose I could have donated it to the library, but why inflict this on anyone else?"
1,takes too long for amazon to deliver,"My issue is not with the movie. Apparently you can only have a dvd copy there are not digital downloads available for this. So i ordered the video wanting to watch it. It took over 14 days to get the movie. I actually ended going to Hastings and buying because it was taking so long. I couldn't cancel the order, I had to wait for it to be delivered, then they want to charge about half of what movie costs to send it back so i kept it. I have ordered many things from Amazon, and have been happy with service from their vendors. I have not been happy with things ordered from Amazon itself. It takes them way to long to ship and deliver their merchandise."
4,Highlander on blu ray finally!,"I just got this in the mail this morning and what a fine blu ray transfer it is! The picture quality is amazing especially for a 20 plus year old film. It is lacking in the special features department, but if your a Highlander fan like me, you'll be happy just having the movie!"
3,There can only be one,"A must-have for 80ies fantasy lovers. With the original idea and Queen's soundtrack this is an absolute classic. They failed to remaster it, so the video quality is essentially that of an 80ies VHS, or at best the DVD version thereof."
1,Highlander,"Good movie, terrible, awful picture quality. I would not have purchased this DVD if I knew how bad it was. The VHS tape was far superior."
3,"Okay, but pretty corny.","The setting was very wired (New York? -- er...). It could havebeen much better if it had taken place through the centuries and spentmore detail on the emotional battles between the immortals. Oh, and also, the pathetic idea of the prize was maddening. Besides that, the villain was not fleshed out, but this was the 80s, so why should I expect character development in the 80s if we in the 90s have so little of it? I don't get the relationship between Ms. Phorensics and our enigmatic hero. One minute they are telling each other to go away and the next they are kissing. Did I miss something? Probably. Did the script writer miss something? Definitely."
2,"Great movie, audio is terrible","I love this movie. I used to own it on VHS and it was great.Something is wrong with the audio when Republic Pictures transferred it to DVD. Sometimes, the dialog is so soft it can barely be heard through the TV. If I turn the volume up to max on my TV, I can then hear the quiet scenes. Then the I get blasted when the next scene starts. It is a very difficult and frustrating version to watch.As a caveat, I only used my TV speakers to watch the video. It is possible that a good home theater system with surround will play fine."
1,Thank you!,"Thank you for all the reviews! I LOVE this movie - I have the Collector's Edition on VHS. I was really looking forward to acquiring a Highlander DVD. After reading a LOT of comments about the transfer from VHS to DVD, I am opting NOT to buy the DVD. Thank you for the warning! Now I need to buy a VCR so I can watch my VHS version whenever I want. Grrr."
3,OLD MOVIE !,NOT MUCH IS GAINED IN CONVERTING THIS TO BLU RAYTHE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS ONLY A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL.
2,"Poor Video, Poor Sound","I liked the theatrical release a great deal, but the original DVD release with the black packaging sucks. The video is nassty and grainy, the audio isn't well synched with the actors lips and the audio flutters and warbles throughout. It's too much for me. It's like watching a dubbed Golden Harvest Kung Fu flick on worn VHS. How could they release this and sell it, if not to make money on the remastered edition?"
3,Good Movie - fair transfer,"I will not bore you with another review of the movie. But I will slam this attempt to make you part with more money. No extra insight into the making of, reasons behind or lost scenes. The second disk is a standard CD with the three main Queen songs. But the first is what is lacking the extras. It has the usual cast bios, trailers, posters and stills. But not much else that would make it worth the extra money. As for the Dolby Digital 5.1 - the music tracks come out real great but the rest of the soundtrack seems to come from only the center speaker. Save money and buy the first DVD and the musical soundtrack."
4,Better then original,"Love this movie...don't know if the movie quality is that much better then the original, but the Queen soundtrack sounds awesome. Can't beat it for the price."
2,Horrible quality on DVD !,"I was really amazed that a THX certified DVD could have as bad picture quality as this movie. It is totally grainy throughout + it is non-anamorphic. There is no way I'm buying this version, perhaps if they remaster it."
3,3.5 Stars,"Since there are plenty of reviews, I will keep this short and review the transfer to DVD. I just purchased the immortal version at a local discount store for under ten bucks. Thirty five dollars on line is grossly overpriced - I expected more from this video at such an original high price.The video transfer is good, not superior. On a 50 inch widescreen TV, grain in the video is apparent (My LCD TV up-converts, and most DVD transfers are near HDTV). The audio is good, not superior. The center channel is on the quiet side. The last 40 minutes of the movie is where the best sound effects kick in for surround sound and deep bass. My Yamaha 1400 amp automatically picks up the 6.1 sound. While the back speakers do have sound, I could not detect much difference in effects from the 5.1 sound.The Queen music CD and videos are excellent, but limited to three songs each.If you can find this locally at a bargain price, it is a worthy purchase, but not at Thirty Five dollars."
1,Digitally Remastered?,"Do yourself a favor and stick with the VHS version, they did such an awful job with the sound, that if you have a 5.1 setup, you will be very disappointed. I was constantly having to increase the volume to hear the vocals during quiet scenes, and lowering the volume whenever the music kicked in. It was very annoying. The video is barely better than VHS. I was wondering why this was priced lower than most DVD's, it's not close to being a DVD."
2,Didn't know DVD quality could be THAT bad!,"While I still enjoyed the great storry, the experience was pretty much ruined by the abysmal quality of the DVD transfer; The picture is grainy, the sound is blurred. In short: if you want to own this film, get it on VHS."
5,Very Good,"I loved the movie, but the first time you see it you have to pay attention or you'll be lost. I thought the concept of immortallity was really creative. But What I really liked was that they didn't protray it as all peaches and cream. Immortals do have problems and do have to worry about getting killed contrary to popular belief. I thought the characters were great. The Kurgan was protraryed wonderfully and Ramirez was hysterical. Chirstopher Lambert did a terrific job of portraying Conner. The special effects and annimation was done really well and the romance added the perfect touch. In my opinion this movie had it all."
4,There Was a Lot of Magic and Lightning and Cliffs!,"The Good Things*Excellent cameramanship; excellent imagery and photography throughout. Very memorable.*Great fight scenes.*Nifty special effects.*Good story. There is a lot of excitement, but also a lot of drama. Very original and interesting.*Good character development.*Pretty good acting, even if it seems overdone or corny.The Bad Things*It's becoming dated.*Sound design is terrible. Some parts are very low and other parts are too loud.*A lot happens, and can be a little tedious to get through.This turned out better than I thought. It is very engaging, with slick photography, fancy special effects, and cool fight scenes. The middle of the movie has lots of drama and character development; a little long perhaps, but it makes for a good, deeper story. Definately worthwhile for fans of sci-fi or fantasy."
3,"""When I was 16, It was a very good year""",I liked this movie when I was 16. Sean Connery was great (still is the best part of this movie). It had an interesting concept for the time and I was...16. I watch it now and think its ok. I would have given it a 5 stars back then now I find it difficult to give it a 3. Maybe its because back then Christopher Lambert was a rising star and not the straight to video poor actor he has become. The appearance of the Fabulous Freebirds and the Queen soundtrack are really good.
2,What?!?,"I can not believe some of the positive reviews on this site like the one below. This transfer is INEXCUSABLE for Blu-Ray. This fantastic movie deserved to be properly remastered. The sound was hallow and tinny. The picture quality was poor, appearing quite grainy. People can refer to that as a ""look"" or a ""style"" all they like, it is an excuse for a completely botched, poor transfer."
3,Highlander,I have the whole (made for T.V.)set and the movies. I have enjoyed them all. Its a great story but to much of the same thing. You know there is going to be a conflict and you know someone is going to lose their head over it.
4,Highlander - It is a great movie,"This blu-ray (director's cut) is nice. They have done a decent job in converting the movie to digital, but you can see it is a conversion. There are scenes that the image is not perfect. I will still give thumbs up!"
2,Will we ever see the Theatrical Cut Again?!,"The extended ""Director's"" aka ""International"" cut of the film is all well and good, but I am still looking for the original US theatrical cut of the film with the excellent pacing and the trimmed down story.I know that DVD came out back in 1995 / 1996 when DVDs were still new and since then its never resurfaced.I bought the Immortal Edition DVD in hopes of getting the US theatrical release as one might expect when something is billed as ""The Definitive Release of the film"". Alas I was lied to and the US theatrical release was not present.In the age of Bluray discs capable of 50GB or storage capacity, one would think that a disc containing both versions of the film was possible. Apparently not..."
2,IT'S JUST A SHAME,"Why? Why god why? Why did they have to ruin it? I was walking through the store looking for Highlander on DVD. When I came across it, I wasn't sure at first due to its low price at 10 bucks. I just figured it wasn't that popular in that store, so I bought it. As I unwrapped it, I couldn't wait to see the clear picture and the great sound of a classic movie on DVD! I then place the DVD in the player it turn it on. NOOOOO!! There are white specs flying across the screen! There are dust particles in the film! The pixles are visible! The music is blasting! The dialogue is almost muted! AAAAGGGGHHHHHH!! turning up the volume and turning down the volume constantly and then finding no special features to the movie. I love this movie, and it's a shame to watch it be carelessly converted into a CD that is actually worse than the VHS version! Please! Re-do this DVD!! Call it back!! Re-master it!"
4,A Good DVD for an Outstanding Movie!,"When I ordered this dvd I was worried about all the bad reviewsit had, but I'm glad I got it at my own risk, because it is a greatversion (and for an amazing price). I believe they did a great jobremastering the movie image. I would recommend this dvd if you likeHighlander. You can also listen to the audio commentary from R. Mulcahy and theproducers, it's very interesting."
2,Disappointment,"I saw the film in the cinema a long time ago and it impressed me much. I was 23 at the time. The good memories blossomed in my mind so I decided to buy the DVD because I thought it was such a classic. Actually, with the eyes of the 32-old that I am now, it's really bad. Except for Sean Connery the acting is bad, for starters. The fighting scene music is atonal mayhem (considering I appreciate heavy metal, that is saying something). Specific to this DVD: The Director's Cut thing adds little, if anything. The sound and music is very loud in comparison to the dialogues. Sometimes there is subtitling when they're actually not saying anything audible."
2,DVD transfer is mediocre at best.,"The movie is good, but the transfer is mediocre. While it is superior to the VHS standard, it is only barely so, and does not live up to the quality we expect in a DVD. This is one that needs a new transfer, with a qualified team, and lots of extras to get us to pay another $10 for a new disk. Mine is about to be a coaster."
2,They are right; Video quality is AWFUL,"Well, I watched the DVD. Everyone was right (sigh). The video is so bad, it's literally unbelievable. You spend more time looking at the grains and pixels than the movie, it's that distracting. Very awful transfer, the story is good as it always was, but it is a waste of money."
4,Highlander-Directors Cut,"I thought that the DVD would be a good version to own of this film, even though I already had the Directors Cut on VHS. I gotta tell you, the VHS is better. The way this movie was made, with a misty, fog like haze overcast through all of the night sequences looked good on VHS, looks grainy on the non-anamorphic DVD. The director's commentary is good..and very interesting during the scenes which were added for the directors cut, however in the commentary they mention a bar scene which would have been nice to show as a deleted scene, but its not there. The title page for the DVD is a bland two color repulic pictures standard page, which is very boring to say the least. And the photo slide show advertised on the package was totally worthless, as the first 500 photos go by in about 3 seconds, so fast that even frame by frame barely catches them all. It seems like this was rushed to market to replace the rare laserdisc version."
3,DVD DTS quality,"You can read the other reviews for a synopsis of the story and the movie, I am reviewing the quality of the latest release that recently came out with DTS. The video quality is mediocre at best.The graininess comes and goes and is mostly atributable to the quality of the source being used. This gets a 2-3 stars. The audio quality and use of DTS was nothing to write home about. The audio did seem to be at an awfully low level compared to other DTS discs that I have watched. I would give the audio 3-4 stars. For a gauge on my comparisons I would give the DTS version of Gladiator 5 stars all around."
5,The Immortal Scotsmen battle for the gathering.,"Connor Mcleod, is a French voiced Scottish Immortal warrior who has lived for centuries. and gone through civilaztions. Connor in the year 1986 in New York is forced to combat a old immortal enemy called the gorgon, to battle for the gathering, where there can only be one."
1,Great movie. TERRIBLE transfer to DVD!!,"This is a great movie. The music, the transitions, the fighting, the chicks; it's great. But when I bought the DVD version, I was truly disappointed. It must MPEG Layer-1 encoded because the artifacts are glaring and the picture quality is awful! Don't buy this movie on DVD!!!!"
3,"Good movie, poor DVD","It's been said before about this transfer: the movie is good, but the DVD is bad. I don't share the opinion that the director's cut ruined the movie. The first scene in Madison Square Garden is botched now, and there is an added WWII scene that explains something that doesn't need explaining, but other than that, it's the same movie. The DVD transfer; however, is less than good. The picture is grainy and the sound is muffled. Perhaps it would have been better in 6 channel surround rather than stereo, but I don't think so. I've not looked, but if the VHS is cheaper than the DVD, buy that instead."
5,You need the extra minutes!,"Okay, a few years ago a boyfriend of mine and I watched the Highlander on video. Then after I got married my husband and I watched all three of them back to back to back. (here's a hint, don't bother watching #2, it stinks and has very little to do with the others) Anyway, I was shocked that my FAVORITE SCENE wasn't in the movie that my husband and I rented.You see I'm kind of an anal person and I need to know all the back ground on things. (Kind of like watching ""Planet of the Apes IV, V and VI). Anyway, in the Non-Directors cut you don't know why he is so attached to his secretary. In the Directors cut you find out that He rescued her from the Nazis in WWII and raised her like a daughter. Anyway, I am getting the Directors cut exclusively for this scene. Until one of my husbands friends at work told him that he has the directors cut and that scene was there, my husband thought that I dreamed it."
3,"The best of the four, if you can find it","For the money, I'd say buy this one. It was the first and is still the best. The sound and picture may not be perfect, I don't remember, but they aren't bad and the story is certainly beter than the sequels made later on. I'm guessing this movie had the lowest budget of the four yet the story telling was much better, more sensible and not so weird. About all that I'd have redone was the part about the handwriting expert looking at several generations of Connor MacCleod's handwriting and pronouncing ""they're all the same man"". That and the sword expert dating a few metal slivers just wouldn't happen. #3 is just a ripoff of this movie, barely anything to do with it, #4 has even less, #2?"
2,"Good Movie, horrible DVD","This is a classic, underrated SCI-FI Fantasy film from the 1980's. It's too bad the digital transfer is so bad. The audio is uneven, and the picture is full of shimmering and other distortions. I think mines going to get auctioned off. Here's hoping the Studio releases a new version of this one!!!"
1,"Great Movie, Crappy Version - Stay With VHS","I like to buy DVD's for the improved picture and audio. You won't find either of those on this one. I was really disappointed what they did to such a great film.Highlander is such a great movie and they added all this great footage, but they really made a mess of the audio. I have the VHS Collectors version as well and it sounds a lot better. This DVD will find its way to the auctions. I'm glad I didn't sell the the VHS.Don't let this review stop you from seeing the movie. It really is one of the best, under-rated movies out there. Just stay away from the DVD version."
1,great disappointment,"I have no idea how the Widescreen Review can justify giving this DVD a 4.5 rating for picture and sound quality; it is easily the poorest DVD I have ever viewed. I have seen this movie on commercial VHS, and on VHS that was recorded off of a movie channel, and either one is just as good visually as the DVD version. What a waste of money. The sound was gratingly sharp, almost tinny, so that I would wince at many of the loud noises in the film.I have been very pleased with the ratings that Widescreen Review has put out on other DVDs that I have purchased, and have used it as a benchmark for determining whether to buy them. They really dropped the ball on this one. Stick with VHS, you'll be much happier."
3,Nothing special to us Brits,"For people wanting to import this film into the UK, be aware that this US director's cut is actually the European version of the film, or at least indistinguishably close. On the subject of the quality, I was in two minds whether to buy if after what I read here. Okay so the DVD might not be as crisp as the format allows, but at no time during watching as I distracted buy any imperfection in the quality."
2,The DVD version is horrible!,I only give this one 2 stars because it's a good motion picture. The picture quality on the DVD is horrible and the sound quality is even worse. Please save your money and find this in some other format. I'll say it again--this is terrible!
3,"Excellent movie, shame about the ""quality""","Weel, firstly let me say that I have always and always will be a huge fan. Thus, as soon as I bought a DVD player, I had to get this on DVD. So, I ordered it, paid way too much for it, and received it a short time later.The movie as expected was the same brilliant movie I remember. The sound was very odd. on a Dolby Pro Logic system it faded horribly all over the place. It was too loud in places and too quiet in others.As for the Director's Cut - This is the exact same version that was released here in New Zealand for the cinemas, so no bonus there.The picture quality was quite shocking. It looked a little like a video tape after about 20 plays. Just starting to get a bit grainy.However, at the incredibly low price this is being offered at recently, I would still recommend buying it if u are a fan. The extra features and commentary are quite good, and a true collector will not be without.I just hope that they remaster it and rerelease it again soon"
2,A great movie but why does the DVD look like VHS?,"When this movie first came out, it is easy to see how it grabbed so many people in so little time. Loaded with good action and fight sequences and with a historical timeline/aspect to it also. Definitely better than the sequels that followed it. Some reviewers had found some slight problems with the sound transfer to the DVD that I didn't really seem to notice. The sounds on DVD are pretty good but I don't quite know what happened to the movie itself in the DVD transfer. The picture is quite grainy on DVD and that is unfortunate but it is still better than VHS. All in all, better than VHS because it is such a good movie but maybe this is a lesson in how to do better next time when transfering VHS to DVD."
1,Thanks for the warnings,"Thanks to all the reviewers for their warnings on the poor quality of this DVD, hopefully the manufacturers will be shamed into re-releaseing it with this problem rectified. I enjoyed the movie, it is still one of my favorites, and I am also a fan of the TV series. I think it very poor that such a classic should be treated this way. I for one will not be wasteing my money on updating to what is supposed to be a superior format."
2,...I remembered it to be a lot better.,"First off, the video is not very good. Might even be worse than VHS (it pixelates! They probably compressed it too much). The sound is very good in a few parts, but overall, the audio-visual experience is pretty bleh. As for the movie itself... I actually found myself laughing at a few scenes that were just so cliche! Kicking, screaming ladies, grunting bad guys and really bad makeup effects (took me a while to realize caked mud on your face is supposed to make you look old). Lambert was dubbed over by at least five people. See this movie for laughs, and don't take it too seriously. Sorry if I offended any die-hards, but I used to love this movie when I was younger. Now I'm embarrased I bought it on DVD."
3,"3 Stars for the movie itself, not the quality of the DVD","Ive never seen so many reviews for a movie that are almost entirely about the DVD audio and video quality. I remember seeing the movie when I was younger, and remeber likeing it, so I rented this movie the other day (for my VCR).I just don't see what is so special about this movie. It is a very cool story, I like how they go back to Scotland, and is a decent fantasy story overall but I would say that its somewhat dated. It was a little confusing as well. Lambert was a good hero, but overall I thought it was a little cheezy. That car scene at the end was pretty stupid. Why did the bad guy have to bring that girl all the way to the abandon factory? That last fight scene was pretty bad. I don't know, I wanted to like this movie, and I think I did when I was 13, but seeing it now, it just didn't impress me. I gave it 3 stars for the cool story, and for Connery."
2,Whats with all the hype,"I love sword-fighting movies, and this was probably the biggest one that I had not seen yet. But after numerous recommendations by friends and coworkers, I got around to seeing this one on DVD, and came away from it unimpressed. All the praises sung for it by others I considered letdowns. For example, many others loved the Queen soundtrack. I found it way of mark. Half the movie took place in the Scottish highlands, and the movie would have came across better with Celtic folk music instead. As for the swordplay, it is slow and does not compare to that found in Rob Roy, Braveheart, or the various Three Musketeer incarnations. Probably the worst part of the movie was Sean Connery, who is Scottish, playing an Egyptian character, but with a Spanish name, Ramirez. How ridiculous. Good think I saw this on DVD and not at the theaters."
3,Immortal cheese.,"I loved this movie when I was younger, I haven't set through the whole thing in years ,I Know why. It is so cheesy and badly done I can see why it only appealed to me when I was younger.In the first fight sequence the guy who is fighting Nash backflips 25 times. My son and I who is 11 laughed our heads off. The sword fighting scenes were unbelievable, poorly choreographed, sparking like the blades were made out of flint. How exactly does a sword knock down a castle wall in the fight sequence of Remirez and the Kurgan. Also I never noticed all of the ghosts flying around after one of the Immortals died, which really looked silly. Overall I guess its ok for kids ,but be forewarned theres alot of language and some nudity so be quick to edit."
2,A bad movie that could have been good.,"There are certain rules to making a good movie. Rule number one clearly states do NOT cast Christopher Lambert. Putting the fact the he is a terrible actor aside, he is not Scottish. He does not even try to fake a Scottish accent in this movie. The only thing this movie has going for it is the strong story line. Unfortunately, poor acting and '80's movie syndrome kindof ruin it. It is good for a laugh though. If only it had been directed by a good director with a Scot cast aws the Scot and a Spaniard cast as the Spaniard...It would be nice to see a remake..."
5,and in the end there can be only one!!!,"Christopher lambert in his immortal role as Connor Mac Leodbattles his fellow immortals!!some are good others evil and in the end there can be only one!!!so better be a good one!!the battles rage between those who have chosen Good,like Mc Leod and others who have chosen evil,like the most famous Kurgan!!!this epic flashes back to us from old time Scotland to today's modern USA!those who lose their heads in a sword fight yield thier power-the power of the lightning -to the one who cuts their head off!!!thus immortals have battled through the centuries;Until Now..."
4,PERFECT reading for young girls!,"All of the books in this series are really just sweet. As a librarian, it is refreshing to find a series that I can whole-heartedly recommend. (It gets 4 instead of 5 stars because, unlike the authors marvelous Henry & Mudge books, you cannot recommend them to everyone). This is Jane Austen for third graders!"
5,Loved this Series!,"My second grade daughter loved this series! These were books that she would read on her own without having to be encouraged to do so. When she took a break from reading the books, she would use her imagination to play out parts of the stories. There are very few books that she's done that with. My one piece of advice with this series is that the first book (In Aunt Lucy's Kitchen) should be read first. It introduces the characters that are in the rest of the books. After that, I'm not sure that it's crucial which order the stories are read until the last 2 books. They should definitely be saved for last. They deal with the cousins leaving Aunt Lucy and then returning for Aunt Lucy's wedding. I'm a big fan of Cynthia Rylant's and these books lived up to her reputation."
3,"Overall: nice, but colors are much paler than picture","I rec'd these earrings within a week of ordering them. My only complaint is that the individual colors depicted are not reflected in the actual earrings I got. Mine are MUCH paler in color and don't have near the vibrancy shown here. I would have preferred the more vivid colors but other than that, I do like them. They are balanced properly and a little different than what you normally see. I like the combination of different colors in that they will go will several different outfits I have."
1,More about seller than product,I order these for my mom and they cancelled the order due to not having any.
1,This is not the Audio Book of Delany's Nova,"Although linked to the Sci Fi novel Nova, this CD is actually airy new age music, not an audio book. It is improperly linked and has nothing to do with the Delany's Nova."
4,A great document,"I've only watched the live show portion so far,but the multi angle cam shots are great!minus one star for the choppy digital remnants on one of the cams that got a bit annoying.can't wait to check the stop-motion part!i think i counted maybe 2-3 ""mess-ups"" during the live set but hey,as you all should know,a few missed notes are absolutely forgivable in return for such audio-superiority in presentation and execution!the world is in dire need of more bands with the musical approach SC3 has:not necessarily more world music hybrids, but more musical creations without artistic restrictions.SC3 can get away with almost anything because they do it with style and integrity. geah."
5,A necessary tool for consulting companies involved with site assessments,I have been using an earlier version of Terrain Navigator for years and have found it indispensable to my work as a groundwater hydrologist in providing on-screen topo maps from the U.S. Geological Survey. Now this updated version is even better as there are more options for viewing and printing the maps or portions thereof. An excellent product. I don't know what I would do without it.
4,A Good Read,"Interesting story about news bureaus and the international gold market. I read it some time ago but remember it being very good. In the Apartheid era, a London news service (similar to Bloomberg or Reuters) gets a call from their South African stringer informing them that many of the gold mines in South Africa have been blown up by terrorists. This of course sends the price of gold skyrocketing, and the reporter at the news service is out to see what happened, why and how the world is being affected."
4,Witches of Wenshar,"Mandrigyn had been left far behind. Sun Wolf had tangled with magic, and now he had to live with the consequences of that folly. With only Starhawk at his side, he began searching for, of all things, a wizard of his own... one to help solve his present problems. When the search brought them to Wenshar, he and the Hawk hoped to remain aloof from its stormy politics -- especially since the Lady Kaletha, a self proclaimed wizard with a strong following, stood at the eye of the storm. But then someone was brutally murdered by magic, and the two found themselves forced to step in and find the killer...If you liked Ladies of Mandrigyn, then you'll love The Witches of Wenshar and the continuing adventures of Sun Wolf and Star Hawk."
1,Not at all worth it,"This ""sword"" is a piece of cheap trash. Whatever is sold is definitely NOT representative of whatever picture is shown. The blade is all of fourteen inches long, made of crude metal, and the handle is cheap plastic. Do not buy."
1,Dimensions,"I have not purchased this item, but where is the dimensions? I have looked all over and see no where to ask seller question and previous reviews show item was smaller than appeared in picture. The description does not provide any dimensions for this blade. Unexceptable."
3,"Loved it, until it broke","I had this wine opener for 2 years until the internal mechanism just spun around, no longer engaging with the cork. Also: I removed the clear plastic guard, as many of my bottles were larger than the interior diameter of the guard.I purchased it on sale for $29.99, so I wasn't disappointed. I did get two good years out of it, and it was great while it worked."
5,Windrusher's a great book,"Windrusher does for cats what J.R R. Tolkien did for hobbits. It's a tale of a cat on a mission that's suffused with the mystical power of cats in ancient Egypt. It's very inspiring, as Windrusher surmounts one unbelievable obstacle after another on a long journey, and, at times, it's just heartbreaking. You really can identify with the characters. Di Genti's verbal pallette of words paints vivid pictures in your mind's eye that makes it seem like you're IN the story, and not just reading it. I'd recommend it highly."
5,Great Journey,An exciting and magical journey that captures the imagination and holds the reader spellbound. I look forward to Windrushers next adventure to the Cave ot Tho-hoth.
5,Delightful Debut Novel.......,"DiGenti has crafted a superb first novel. A page turner, filled with suspense, romance (of a feline nature) and compassion, I found myself rooting for Windrusher and his journey from the beginning.A cat owner myself, I was astounded at how well the author managed to get into the feline psyche. He also exhibits sad but truthful knowledge on the tragic plight of stray cats in our country.A delightful and magical story of determination, courage and love. I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel."
5,"Beautifully written, destined for the big screen!","Rush like the wind to get your copy of this brilliant first novel by author, Victor DiGenti! Amazing and riveting story of a super cat which is sure to ultimately end up on the silver screen, along with the likes of many classics which preceded it. ""Windrusher"" will steal your heart and captivate your senses! You won't be disappointed with this masterpiece of feline fiction, whether you're a cat lover or not. DiGenti is a genius, which makes me wonder if he has some supernatural insight into the world of cats...perhaps from a past life in the feline world?"
3,3 - 6 week delivery more like 3 - 6 months,"I generally am very happy with Amazon's service but I ordered this book and the sequel on September 27th, 2006. I received the sequel soon thereafter. This book I still have not seen. I am sure the book itself is delightful but the service is appalling. Do not believe that it will be delivered in ""3 - 6 weeks"". Amazon can not seem to deliver on this book. I will have to shop elsewhere at least for this title."
5,Nice Book Gift,I bought this as a gift for my niece for X-mas this past year. SHe loved it so I was very happy with the purchase.
4,Puts you in the Christmas mood,"This was an unexpected and delightful Christmas present. I am not a great fan of the festive music offerings usually available most of which are stale and uninspiring but this was different.There are a few familiar items but these are generally well arranged in particular the opening track Adeste Fideles sung in its original Latin and sang beautifully by soloists and choir. Emma Kirkby, not surprisingly, steals the show but does not necessarily outshine all the others both singers and instrumentalists. Martin Neary as ever guides them all through in a sensite and professional way and it is a great pity that there will be no further collaboration with the Westminster Abbey forces he had guided so well for so long.Some of the material is not of great musical value but it is never less than melodic and mercifully free of the saccharine treatment this music can easily attract in the wrong hands. I recommend that this is played at any time of the year."
4,Quietly lovely.,"While the selections are somewhat diverse when you consider the genre, the recording itself could have been better. Still beautiful and quite elegant. I especially like their version of ""The Darkest Midnight in December"" which is done acapella."
2,Why is Emma Kirkbridge on this cd?,"I bought this cd because I love Christmas music, the Westminster cathedral choir and the boy 's that sing on it. I was not aware that Emma Kirkby was on this cd untill I played it at home. I should have played a sample of the cd but I didn't. It has no mention of her anywhere on the info.I was bitterly dissapointed. I do not like her voice that much and certainly would not have bought it. I did find another cd that has the same title and the same songs, exactly as are on this one, sans Emma. I'm sorry if I hurt any Emma Kirkby fans, it should have been mentioned."
1,Threads are damaged right out of the package,Threads are damaged right out of the package.. I cannot even thread this into the oil pan.. so what good is it. It also looks like with the right bump on a road this could leak
5,Great poetry!,"I loved Linda Beach's book of poetry, "" Shades of Life."" Her descriptive use of language is amazing. I could clearly see the moss dancing in the wind. Her poetry is readable and enjoyable. Every person who reads her poems will relate to them in some form. Once I started reading her poems I was unable to stop!"
2,"Initial amusement, turns into boredom","Unfortunitely this game wastes a great and fun concept. The matches are far too easy, and after playing for about 30mins, you've pretty much seen all there is to see. I admit some of the moves are quite funny, but it grows incredibly dull after a short period of time. Considering how long it took them to get this game onto the shelves, you would have expected a lot more from it. But it ends up feeling like it was thrown together at the last minute.A big disappointment."
5,What a hoot! Cousin rulz!!!,"Damn the critics. For those with a sense of humor that begs for Three STooges idiocy, this is it. Take control of pixilized clay celebrities and let them kill each other. You can be Mr. T shoving dynamite up an opponent's butt or squirt hot milk from the breast of Anna Nicole Smith. Still not enough? Take the receiving end of a golden shower as the Wolfman raises his leg on you, or slam dunk your opponent's head as you take the controls of Dennis Rodman.The announcers are here with their stupid remarks and off the wall humor. They even join in the action as a wizard and a gladiator.I bought this game mainly because I'm a big Anna Nicole Smith fan, but I gotta admit, the three legged, backwoods country cousin is the funniest thing to hit my TV screen in a long time.Good fight. Good night."
4,son loves this,"my 2 year old is obsessed with monster trucks and watches this at least once a day- but he'll only watch the monster truck part- the dvd is split into two segments- race cars and monster trucks. it's good, because he can totally bypass the car part and go directly to the trucks, but on the other hand, it seems like a waste of a DVD to me. i give this 4 stars, for good price and the fact that my boy LOVES it, but to me, it seems kind of cheesy and low budget."
5,innovative,"We all remember the side scrolling shoot em up fast paced games for nintendo. Lesser known titles like this one arent as white knuckle but instead have the player do something most modern games dont...THINK. This is not a strategy game but strategy is involved. You have to keep visibility, ammo, speed, and the ability to learn and read your enemy before you make any decisions. You can play scenarios in the Pacific to stalk convoys and attack them when you feel they are most vulnerable. Also you can pull hit and runs simply fire a torpedo and get out of there before destroyers start dropping charges...you CAN blow debris and hope they take it but it is rare that they will. This was a great ""simulator"" and still is-I dont know of any other submarine games for the new skews."
2,"Damn, Boredom Is Born in Silent Sleep.","There must be a million of things better to do on a rainy day, but playing Silent Service is not one of them. It's a one great big BORE! Cool concept, yes...but zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
5,Great for fine grooves,I make wooden board games and this bit is great for making fine grooved lines using my Bosch Palm router. I bought this because it was on sale and I needed it.
5,Great!,I have decades of experience for tea drinking and this is one of the best blends available. It is perfect for people who prefer dark teas.
5,Awesome read,Can't wait to read the next one. Might have myself a new author to follow. Strong characters in this series.
3,Good Quick Read,"This book was a good quick read, but the main character spent way too much time about her ""should she, shouldn't she"" relationship."
2,It needs more.,"The premise is intriguing; the story is very good. But the writing left me dissatisfied. It was very uneven: at times smooth, at times so awkward I felt I was reading a middle-schooler's attempt at a romance novel. The characters held unfulfilled promise, and their conversation at times was excruciatingly stilted. Overall, I liked the story enough to look at the next in the series. But I will lower my expectations so that I can enjoy it more."
3,Very interesting read,"This book by Tardif is an interesting one. Its premise is that some people in a special area of our government have unique abilities that most of us do not have or don't know we have. These folks are seeking a murderer with these special skills. A lot of interaction between the main characters and some of the other characters. A good, solid, interesting, read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,A Very Different Perspective,"This novel will grab the reader's interest with the intricate, unusual plot. The main character is spunky, tough and fun to follow through the book. The reader will constantly be bombarded with new developments to the mystery, the author keeps the reader guessing in this story. The characters are very intriguing; the main character pulls the novel together, but the secondary characters give it flavor. The author craftily creates the scene for when Jasmine enters the killer's mind; the reader will get a very different perspective, not one found in many novels. The ending is satisfying, the reader will be happy with it. This book is recommended for adults who enjoy intense mystery and action novels.*Complimentary copy received for this review, does not affect my opinion in any way*"
3,Not bad,"I liked the premise of this story quite a bit, actually. The only reason I had to knock a star off was because it was unpolished in several areas. The romantic attraction between the protagonist and another person didn't flow naturally; it felt more formulaic than anything else. And at times the dialogue and narrative was stilted. A lot of snarling, whining, growling, head swiveling, etc. Overuse of those types of descriptive words can start to affect the overall work, and that happened in this case. But the general plot was pretty good - just wish the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more."
4,Enjoyable psychic adventure,"Divine Intervention blends murder and arson with psychic abilities and romance to come up with its own genre. I must admit I am a sucker for psychic stories, the ability totally fascinates me. The author, Cheryl Kaye Tardif, did a great job using the three psychics and their specific talents in the story. I liked how they each had their own strengths, thus were responsible for separate parts of the investigation.The story flowed smoothly and was well-paced. It kept my interest, so I read it quickly. The romance between Jasi and Brandon didn't overshadow the plot of the mystery, which is a huge plus for me. I would have liked even a little more fleshing out of the characters, but I thoroughly enjoyed each of the main ones.I hear Cheryl has a sequel to Divine Intervention coming out and I'm looking forward to reading it. In the meantime, I recommend you read this one!*Disclaimer: I received this book for free from the author, I was not required to write a positive review."
4,divine intervention,"Jasi McLellan is an agent in the CFBI with a specialty in arson investigations, in fact she is a Pyro-Psychic. The smoke gives her visions and often puts her inside the arsonist during the last moments as they set the fire. Jasi and her team have been assigned to a case of a serial arsonist, which at first glance have no ties to each other than the Gemini lighter left at both scenes. This investigation gets more complicated with each new clue that develops and if Jasi and her team don't solve the case in time, more lives are in danger. This is a great book, with some unforseen twists and great character development. Definitely recommended!"
2,boring for my toddler,"I bought this for my nearly 2 yr old son who loves trains big and small. He loves the Thomas the Tank Engine series and loves to see the train in the Baby Einstein ""On the Go"" DVD, but this was a total let down. He wasn't interested at all and no wonder. It is too much standing around and talking. I tried to keep the whole tape on fast forward but even then it was dull---particularly this endlessly long segment where Harry is seated in the dining car with two school aged children-- and that's it! How is that interesting? To a child who doesn't understand conversations, the banter is not entertainment. To a parent who does understand the conversations, it is pure mindless torture. I've never given anything such a poor review. I won't even bother describing more of the same with the helicopter segment. This DVD is in need of major editing if it is to appeal to little tikes."
2,So cute it'll make you want to hurl,"The good part first. The tunes are nice and I am sure they will appeal to both adults and children. But the lyrics... Unless you are a purple dinosaur, this is just too much. The person who wrote the lyrics for Farm Animal Friends cannot possibly even have seen a farm. (I showed the video to someone who grew up on a farm and she went into hysteric giggling.) And Selfish Shellfish teaches the joys of sharing with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. It must be possible to make inspirational music for kids without patronizing them. I suggest that G & GTG sit down and read Pippi Longstocking (or anything else by Astrid Lindgren)."
1,Extremely annoying- even my toddler hates it.,"Wow. I was sent this by somebody who thought I would love it. It's horribly annoying. I put it on when I got it in the mail and my toddler looked at me like I was crazy, and she usually loves music and dancing. Perhaps if she listened to more traditional kids music she would like it better. If you're interested in more indie kids music, I'd suggest the Ida/Elizabeth Mitchell albums ""You are my flower"" and ""You are my Sunshine"", as well as the compilations ""The Bottle Let Me Down"" (bloodshot records) and ""Greasy Kid Stuff"". My toddler truly enjoys those albums."
5,"I swear by GWENDOLYN, moms!",My daughter (and my husband and I) has been a fan of this CD for almost a year now. Emily was just 5 months old when I bought our first copy after seeing them perform at Storyopolis and it is the ONLY CD that I can play on our many trips from LA to Santa Barbara where she'll sit through and listen the entire time! Not a peep out of her. I have given it to many a friend with a toddler who hates car rides and I just can't recommend this CD enough. The plus here too is that it's fun for adults as well. We all know how singing songs over and over for our children can be a bit boring and tedious - not so with the songs from this CD. My daughter is now almost 1 1/2 yrs old and loves it now even more that she can sing along too!PS - try to see them perform if you can - they really give a good show.
2,More hype than light,"I had a set of these for about one year before one burned out. A common complaint. I was also disappointed as soon as I installed them. They are tinted blue to give the ILLUSION of whiter light, but they are really just blue bulbs. They are probably overvolt bulbs to burn brighter to compensate for the light absorbed by the coloring. That would explain the short life. Would you rather see better or look better? That's what you have to decide before you spend a premium for these. It was money wasted for me. GE Nighthawks have been a better alternative; a little brighter without the blue nonsense."
1,Died in six months - beware!,"A couple years ago I bought SilverStar bulbs and they didn't last a year. I recently gave them another try and didn't even get six months out of these expensive bulbs - what a ripoff! Can't someone make a bulb that lasts more than a year?? I'm tired of being pulled over by the police because my headlights are out, so I'm going back to the Cool Blue lights that are rated for twice the lifespan of SilverStars."
3,Sylvania 9005sst,"Not very happy, not as bright compared to other options that are available. I wanted more light while driving, However they did work .......Would I buy them again or for my other vehicle NO!"
4,Outstanding Native American Samples,"I was pleased with the Native American tracks that were offered. Very authentic and moving, especially 'Kiowa Ruffle Dance' and 'Morning Prayer'. I was not pleased with only 57 minutes of music from a 720 minute film. I was anticipating a CD comparable with 'How the West Was Lost Vol 1 & Vol 2'. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If the purpose was to provide a teasing cross section balanced between Native American and others, then I guess the producer accomplished his goal. Unlike 'How the West Was Lost' the music of which stands alone, I would only recommend this recording to those who view the film."
5,Wonderful little peppers,"My sister in law (in TX) brought these at Thanksgiving and stuffed them with cream cheese. They were SO good. I could not find them here in WA, so I had to order them. They are worth the price. Try them out! By the way, I do not like bell peppers."
4,Great Book But There are a Few Kinks!,"Okay first of all I know it ain't the writters fault that there are mistakes in this book but overall this book was good. There are a few kinks but nothing serious. I would love to see this book become a movie because it sounds like one by the writting stlye. I don't like books that much but it alright.My fav character would be Victoria. Cool gal. Rebecca, the main is wicked, especially when she uses her powers against the Shadow Dude. Read it it's a eye grabber and a heart pacer!"
2,Not sharp enough,"This product is a great design, cheaply implemented. The blades slip under the mats fine and the tips are rounded so not to poke the dog. However the blades aren't sharp enough to cut. You can get some with a sawing motion - assuming your dog will sit tight as you pull some hairs out."
4,Great for long haired cats.,"I think this comb is great. I have a Norwegian Forest and a Turkish Angora and this has been a lifesaver when getting mats/knots out. It is a little on the large side for my hands, but it's not inconvenient. Overall, good pet grooming tool."
4,Great grooming tool!,"I really like this comb - it actually works on my poodle cross' wiry hair! It takes a bit to start each mat off, but once you get into it the comb is quite effective and easy to use. received it fast. Comfy to hold handle. Great for the price. will be interested to see how long the razors stay sharp for. So far have only used 5 times but am liking it :)"
3,"Nice twist, but confusing","I have a Masters degree in Italian language and literature. I am quite familiar with the Medici and actually purchased this book while in Florence as I thought it would be an interesting read while I was in the land of the Medici. I thought it fascinating to read how the Medici made their money and how banking was approached, it was an aspect of history not often addressed. However, while I am not a dumb person or ignorant when it comes to this topic, I found this book somewhat disorganized and hard to follow. It seemed to skip back and forth within the 90 year time period that it covered. Perhaps it was due to my lack of familiarity with banking, but there were times I just had to put to book down or reread a few pages to try to grasp the continuity. That said, I did read it cover to cover, so there were many redeeming aspects to it: mostly the novelty of the point of view."
1,Terrible,"I was shocked to discover that this book was published by the Norton Press. Here goes my best at a Tim Parks inspired juvenile and/or hackneyed rhetorical question: ""Have Standards Fallen so Low?"" This is not a work of History, and it is not written by an Historian. It is anecdotal and unscholarly. The exploration of metaphysics does not warrant that word's presence in the title. It is poorly written, and moves in and out of tense haphazardly, notes are absent and sources are uncited, and finally and perhaps most egregious; Sentence fragments are the norm as opposed to the exception. Its astounding what gets published these days. So there is definitely a lesson to be taken from the business savvy here; this book is excellently marketed....beautiful cover, thought provoking title etc. Too bad its tripe. Way to go 'Enterprise', you got me."
5,Read It,"I bought this book at the Rome train station on my way to Florence for vacation. I don't have a deep background in this subject but read this book with great enthusiasm + pleasure. He's a terrific, vibrant writer + the subject matter is gripping."
3,A Series of Passing References,"High school history books usually make at least a passing reference to the Medici family for its role in the banking industry and its support of the arts during the Renaissance.This book sheds some light on the peculiar banking machinations or ""exchanges"" that the Medici used to circumvent the church's ban on charging interest for loans. Other than the banking processes the book is padded out to 253 pages of what feels like a series of passing references for the readers of ""USA Today.""""Medici Money"" is easy to read, but short on content."
3,Not best medici book,"I love reading about the Medici family. This book leaves a bit to be desired. It does a poor job with its descriptions and explanations. There is a lot of background information that is needed left out, so unless you have a previous knowledge of the family it's hard to follow.The book does have some of the best layout of the Medici bank, but could definitely be easier to follow and have better explanations.If you're looking for a good Medici book, House of Medici is by far the best I've read, its complete and easy to read."
5,Brilliant History of the Rise and Decline of the Medici,"This is mainly a history of the Medici banking enterprise, and it is fascinating to learn just how the bank declined. The problem was the passing of generations of bankers who loved banking. Their successors, unfortunately, were more interested in the social aspects of belonging to the Medici banking family. This lead to their spending more time being friends with royalty and other high potentates than on the bank itself. Consequently, the Medici banking house went into decline that ultimately proved terminal.The fate of the Medici bank has been repeated over and over in history as there are all too often cases of virtuous and hard working founders whose creations were ultimately wasted away by relatively lazy successors.In event, this is a great book that sheds new light on a subject that had already been heavily written about."
1,Leave it on the road,"This book wreaks of the scent of an author who is best left out on the road.You know when you are at a dinner or cocktail party, and you look over and see a group of people listening uncomfortably to one person who won't stop speaking? Inevitably you realize the guy talking is the same guy who won't shut up about his travels here and there and how amazing this was and that was and how ""oh my gawd"" you have to go here but be careful to never do this when there...and all you can think is ""Where is that earthquake when you need it?"" so you can eek out of the conversation.I think that Bruce Northam IS that guy. But zooted. And religious.This book is preachy, arrogant, uninformative, vague and predictable -- all the things we hope an adventure in the great beyond won't be.This book should have been left out on the road, where Northam should have stayed."
5,A great read for on the road or on your couch,"This is a great book of upbeat travel tales that will inspire you to start planning your next adventure. The vignette style format of the book allows you to pick it up and put it down as you please without losing the rythem of the book. This is a fun read, with a positive feel."
4,Cute!!!,My little boy watches this show on TV daily and loves it. He especially loves the music. We bought this to take with us on road trips and it really keeps him occupied. I really enjoy the story and music myself.
5,Great Video,My son loves the Backyardigans. The Ghost video is his favorite. He watches it over and over.
3,As long as she likes it,A gift for our daughter from a good friend.We had never seen these before. Our daughter has watched this probably a good 100 times now...she sings along with it. Some of it doesn't make any sense...but as long as she likes it that is all that matters.
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!","The Backyardigans are wonderful, and this dvd is our favorite. Our four year old LOVES the pirate episode and the Soccer Monster one. We all love the music, including my 18 month twins who now ""arrgh"" whenever this comes on. Darling dvd. The Backyardigans is a rare show; one that parents like as much as the kids. A+++"
4,Entertaining at any time.,"I just recently bought this for my daughter in my department at work since we enjoy watching Backyardigans on tv. I am glad that they have 4 episodes on the dvd. The extras could have been better, so I only gave this 4 stars.The colors are very vibrant and the songs are pleasent and catchy. I haven't come across one that is annoying. My daughter isn't interested in other shows like Dora, Max & Ruby, etc, so I'm glad she is interested in Backyardigans. She dances along to them and even laughs.I recommend this show to anyone who wants something GOOD for their child to watch. Thank you Nick Jr for having a decent show out. Now my daughter can take time out from playing, and watch/sing/dance to some entertaining characters, it is one show I am glad she watches and will watch with her."
5,This is an excellent DVD for your child's collection!,"My 3-year-old daughter LOVES the Backyardigans, and since they are relatively ""new"" they are sometimes hard to find in the stores. This is another excellent DVD from the show. We enjoy watching them too! The music is amazing, and the colors are gorgeous. This is a very good show for both boys and girls. It teaches them to use their imagination and to use cooperative play. I highly recommend The Backyardigans to everyone who has a child ages 2-6."
5,My nieces watch it over and over again,"This is their favorite video from the Backyardigans, I dont know if its the colors, the music, or the story but, they love it!"
5,Great Moments in the history of Celtic,The authors go in chronological order with each chapter focusing on a significant moment in Celtic's history starting in 1892 with the 5-1 victory over Queens Park in the Cup Final and ended with the 1-0 victory over Rangers in the 1989 final. The book also interlaces little details of what was going on locally and in the world at large at the time. A great read for any fan of Celtic or anybody interested in the history of Celtic in general.
3,"Solid research, not inspired","There is little to outright complain about in this book; the love of the lore is evident, and the research, while not earthshattering, does not appear to be faulty. There is a decidedly amateurish tint to the writing, but Erinphiles will enjoy it, no doubt."
1,Out of Date,"Created over 20 years ago, this DVD is out of date. It discusses 1980's technologies such as LORAN C, analog radar, and mechanical depth finders. Basically it is an old VHS tape recording that has been transferred to DVD."
2,not so sure,this album sounds like a dj mixtape for 9 year olds.. i think it sounds too cartoony... there were a couple of good songs on there but it just wasnt enough.. i'm a huge fan of hip hop but this album felt like it was a novelty cd made by a drunk guy who just discovered a turntable for the first time.. childrens humor + rap = the amazing adventures of dj yoda
5,Couldn't live without this product.,"I live in an apartment and picking up dog poop isn't the most idea thing in the world... luckily, these bags and this bag carrier make everything easier."
3,Hard to move from one leash to another,"I find the clip on these very difficult to move from one leash to another. It's just hard to open, not an easy clip.Additionally, if your dog sometimes runs on the sidewalk with his leash dragging on the ground, these don't hold up well. I live in Manhattan, and sometimes when my dog is playing with another dog on the sidewalk, I will drop the leash so it doesn't get tangled with the other dog's. After doing this a few times, the bone broke off of the clip."
5,Great Product,"Have it hooked to the leash. It fell off once, but heared it when it hit the ground. The reason why was we didnt have it secure enough. Doesn't get in the way of walking the dog either."
4,This is a cute and handy item.,"I haven't yet used the bags, as my dogs almost never go poo on leash, but I wanted to have something with us for that one occasion. I can't comment on how handy the bag size will be. (I have 2 Great Danes) I did not like the clip however, its not easy to use or change from leash to leash. I ended up attaching a caribiner clip with a split ring to the 'bone' to make it user friendly."
3,bags on boards bone dispenser,"the bags do not tear easily and several will come out of the roll at once. Otherwise, bags are good."
5,Love it -- very convenient!,"I love this dispenser -- very easy to clip to a leash so the bags are at hand. AND the bags don't leak -- so less messy / icky than the plastic grocery bags I used to use for this purpose -- if one had a hole in it - yuck! Problem solved with these bags and dispenser -- what a great idea, love 'em! :)"
3,Little bulky + the twists are broken,I wouldn't buy it again; a bit bulky then the rest of the market products. The closing portion will lock but if you try to twist a bit harder it unlocks completely. My dog loves to pull & it's met the asphalt couple of times... still holding as day 2!
3,Bags on Board Bone Dispenser,"Item arrived as advertised and on time.The carabiner attachment clip which it includes does not have enough strength.It failed after a month. To remedy this, I tie wrapped the item to the dog leash butthen the plastic attachment on the item broke off.I am not totally satisfied with this item."
5,Very handy!,"I couldn't tell you how many times I've walked out of the house with my dog and forgotten to grab an old grocery store bag and had to run back and get one. This handy little product solves that problem because it attaches directly to the leash. Refills are easily found here on Amazon and cheap enough so that if your already buying something else and you need that little ""extra"" item to bring your total up to the $25 for the free shipping ... well, this is ALWAYS handy to add on. Bags are perfect size too for my 25-pound dog who sometimes poop's 2-3 times on a single walk, I can usually manage to get all picked up with a single bag."
4,"Good dispenser, why can't I open the bags?","OK, maybe I have a defective roll of poopy plastic, but I have a really hard time opening the blue bags. Meanwhile, my little cocker spaniel is staring at me like I'm an idiot. I don't have any complaints about the dispenser, though."
2,Don't drop it!,"Like many other reviews, this dispenser is great, IF you don't drop it. the End cap threads are minimal and do NOT screw together very tightly. As time goes by (2 months), it gets easier and easier for the end cap to pop off and out pop the bags. Yes, you can laboriously re-roll the bags and put it back together, but a real pain! This same company has one that looks like a fire hydrant that is MUCH better... we have never had a problem with it for 6 years!MUCH better built. Its been dropped many times with no issue! thanks"
4,not so great price,"I found this same item at the christmas tree shop for 1.00 and the general dollar store for 1.00. Great item, but much cheaper elsewhere!!!!"
3,Bad for fat fingers,Product quality is fine and it worked great but I consistently had a hard time getting bags out when it got to the end of the roll. Not good for someone with large hands.
2,Disappointed!,"The dispenser is a neat idea, but the bags would have been ten times better if they had handles. I'm looking round for different bags in a roll, to use with the dispenser. I'm disappointed that the bags are not very user-friendly. I often have to walk quite far to find a doggie bin and the lack of handles is annoying."
4,Second one of these we have purchased,Great dispenser. Only problem is some of the bigger rolls of bags don't fit. You have to buy the Bags On Board bags to fit in it correctly. The only reason this is our 2nd one is that we lost our leach and attached dispenser on vacation.
3,kind of does as intended...,"this product is fine, but i often pull too hard and tons of bags coming out. even gravity seems to do the trick. Also, makes the leash a bit uncomfortable to hold given the way it latches onto it. Still, holds poop bags so how much can you complain"
3,hmmmm....,"The bags are just what I needed! The dispenser is not very sturdy. I go through dispensers very quickly. If the dispenser hits the ground, it will crack."
3,great dispenser but cheap plastic,"I loved this dispenser until the first time we dropped the leash it was attached to and the little loop on the bone that held the fastener broke. We'd had it about a week. Well, ok, no big deal, I wrapped a zip tie around it and hooked the plastic ring through that and atatched it back to the leash. Well, the leash got dropped again, and that plastic loop broke too. The bone part has held up great, but now I need something else to hang it on the leash. And really the zip tie wrapped around it is not very convenient either. It dispenses well and is easy to load, I just wish the parts that attach it to the leash were sturdier. I am trying to decide if I get another and see if it lasts or find a different style dispenser altogether. It is cheap, so at least I am not out a lot of money."
2,Needs to be more durable.,"I adopted a dog from a rescue that was not yet trained to walk nicely on a leash. Within one day of taking him for his thrice daily walks the plastic connector between the dispenser and the leash broke. Now I have to carry the dispenser in the other hand, which makes controlling the dog and picking up his droppings very difficult. It is a great idea but it would be much improved if it was made of something other than cheap plastic."
3,Not what I expected...,"I purchased two of the black dispensers. After using it for acouple of months, the first one broke. (The clip that holds onto the leash)I tried super glueing it but that didn't work. So I used one dispenser for two dogs. Not long after the second one broke. smh... I am not sure if we are considered ""rough"" users, because all we do is walk our dogs 3-4 times a day and occasionally the leash falls on the floor where the dispenser is clipped onto. But no dogs chewed on it or anything. I don't know what the life-span is suppose to be either, but maybe a rubber heavy duty one would be better... I dunno I have to go shopping for a new now..."
5,Functional and Cute,This is a great way to carry around annoying bags when walking the pup! It's great for living in an apartment where I have to pick up after my dog. It is nice that the plastic holder attaches to the leash so that it is always ready to go wherever the dog goes. The look of it is nice. The screw top end is very functional for keeping the bags in and not having to worry about them falling out. A great investment.
4,very handy,"Simple is sometimes profund. How many times has your dog pooed more often than you expected, or you forgot your clean up bag? With ""bags on board"" you'll always be ready. This item is reasonably priced, as are the refills. Lots of colors available, too. Buy this! If you have a dog, you really need this product! It fits nicely on the handle of any leash, and bags are very easy to remove and use."
5,Amazon Verified Purchase,I bought this for my daughters dog as she uses quite a lot of bags. They are neat to carry in your pocket and you only pull one out at a time. I sometimes take her dog out and therefore I too also find them very very handy. Everyone who has a dog should have them. It keeps our parks and roads clean.
4,"Love the dispenser, not the bags","The bone dispenser is great. Easy to pull out each baggie and re-fill as needed. However, the bags leave much to be desired.Not only are they very thin, but at least 10 were defective: They were just a layer of plastic that weren't double-plied, so when one side was supposed to open to reveal a bag, it was just a solid sheet of plastic. I had to skip to the next bag, thus wasting useless plastic.Also, many of them weren't properly cut, causing the next bag to rip, making it unusable as well.So, buyer beware. The bone dispenser is a great idea and ensures you won't be caught empty handed; I would just suggest planning on getting a different type of doggy bags as refills."
2,worked ok for a week,"I like the concept, but this isn't the best execution. My dog broke the clip within 2 weeks. If it was rubber, or a stronger plastic it would be a better product."
3,Flimsy,"I've had several of these. I have no problem getting the bags in and I find having the bag attached to the wrist loop of my leash to be convenient.The problem? The plastic ""clip"" that attaches the dispenser to a leash could hardly be flimsier. Twice now I've looked down to find the dispenser missing because the clip failed while I was jogging with my dogs.If you're not subjecting the clip to any stress, these might be fine. For me...I'm just planning to stuff the roll of bags in my pocket."
5,handy,I bought this bag holder in order to bring my Amazon order over $25 to get free delivery. It turns out it's used everyday. It attaches to the leash so there is always a bag handy when I take the dog out.
3,"Works ok, but connector breaks easily","The bag holder works will for its basic functions. It holds bags and dispenses them easily. Of course, you have to purchase their bags.However, the plastic ring attached to the bone has cracked open so that the dispenser no longer attaches to the leash. It isn't easily repaired, so once it's broken you'll need to find another way to attach the dispenser to the leash. I used a zip-tie, but YMMV."
4,"Good bag holder, but a little bulky","Makes for a good holder, attaches to the leash firmly, but could be smaller and lighter. Is a little bulky."
3,Bags on Board,"It is very durable and has been working just fine. It would be nice if the perferations were deeper so it would tear easier, but not a deal breaker."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad little bag holder. Found one locally (at Riteaid) for a couple bucks cheaper right after I ordered mine, but its all good. :)"
5,GOOD,"Very good, I added a different clip to the bone so that it could slip on and off easily to other things (like my belt hook, a bag strap, the leash handle, etc. The bags are fine, strong enough for the purpose. I pretty much use these exclusively."
3,Don't hold the roll very well,"I thought the concept was really cute, however, the bags don't roll out as well with this as another style I had."
3,Like the idea,"I like the idea of keeping these around, but the end that screws on seemed to be ""stripped"" (it doesn't stop). Kind of chunky on the dog leash too. Good idea, but needs a little work."
5,Perfect,Easy to use and is very convenient. A lot more convenient than sticking a plastic bag in your pocket every time you take your dog for a walk. Because it attaches to the leash you never forget one and you always have extras in case there's more than one uh going. Good product.
2,"Small Bags, cheap plastic","I have a puppy so I bought one of these since I knew I'd be taking him out a lot. The bags are really small, had to fit your hand in and turn inside out without getting feces on your hand. The bags would also be much better if you could tie it close like several other brands. Nothing worse then walking around with a bag of poop that you can tie close during a long walk! The dispenser is also cheap, if you drop the leash the lid comes flying off and never really tightens before it starts loosening again. I'd look for other similar products, I've just started putting bags in my pocket."
2,good idea,but expensive JUST FOR DOG POOP!!!!!It's good to have one during travel especially if you have more than 2 SMALL dogs. Tho not a necessity. Bags are pretty darn small. Most people complain. End up getting poop on your hand lol.Those poop bags at dog parks are way more better. No container for bags but the bags are bigger and THICKER. These ones are SUPER THIN & SMALL.
2,Easily Breakable,"I generally like this dispenser, but the little plastic loop that connects the bone to the clip broke and now it falls off all the time. I wish they would either make this more durable or replace it with something metal or a cloth strap.Also, it's a bit heavy compared to some of the fabric dispensers. I will not buy another."
5,Handy & helpful!,"A great and easy way to be a responsible pet owner. You'll never forget one or bring too few along on a walk. So much better than supermarket bags, especially when you have a 6 lb. dog."
3,More expensive here than Petsmart?!,"I bought this item based on the positive reviews but shortly after it was shipped out, I saw the same dispenser (minus the extra 30 bags) at Petsmart for $2.99!I also agree with another reviewer that they should make MUCH smaller bags, especially for smaller breeds. These bags are already a bit big for my parents' Siberian Husky...I can only imagine how wasteful it's going to be when I use a whole bag each time my new 8 week old Yorkie needs to go while we're on a walk."
4,Great but big,I like this product a lot. Couldn't be more convenient. I attach it to the dog's leash where it meets the collar and it is always right there when we go for a walk. I don't have to worry about finding bags when we go out.It is a bit big though so for a smaller dog you might want to attach it where only you will be carrying the weight of it.
4,Easy way to manage your doggie bags,"If you're using this in conjunction with their brand of biodegradable bags, my only criticism is that I wish the stick that hold the bags in place was permanent. Too bad to have to throw out a piece of plastic every time you put in a new roll of bags. And I'm not sure if the plastic is recyclable."
3,Great shape,"I love the bone shape poop bag holder but I wish it wasn't so bulky. I have a miniature poodle,the poop bag and holder is much too large. They need to make smaller bags and downsize the bone holder. The concept is excellent but modifications need to be made."
2,broke in a week,Mine broke in a week. I'm giving it 2 stars because I didn't bother to return it and I only give 1 star if the company refuses to stand by their product.
1,Waste of Money,The container is not large enough to fit replacement bags without tremendous hassle and frustration. I have only been successful two times placing replacement bags in the container. The other four times I tried I was not successful and the bags came unrolled as I tryed to stuff them in. It is not easy to place the bags in the container and thread the beginning of the bags through the hole in the dispenser. I hate this container and I am looking to buy something else. I do like the hands free concept of being able to walk and not hold poop bags in my hand. I just want a dispenser big enough to hold replacement bags/rolls with ease. I rate it a one because I thought the bone shaped dispenser was really cute.
3,Not so functional,"It looks cute and fits the bag roll, even different ones. But it's not so convenient, the hook to attach it to the leash is really hard to open and the whole thing sort of gets in the way. I have a beagle so I like to wrap the leash around my wrist (so there is no fear of him running away)but it is right where this dispenser should go. And I don't want to add another weight to his collar either.I am giving 3 stars because maybe it's a matter of preference, and because we still use it at home, since it is easier to get the bags from it, without messing up the roll like in case it were to fall down or anything like that."
1,Not really biodegradable,"If you enlarge the photo you see it says something about how California doesn't consider this actually biodegradable. There are so many ""biodegradable"" products that only break down in certain unlikely conditions. Buy Biobags. They're the real deal. (And no, I don't work for them!)"
5,cheaper than in store.,pet supplies plus sells this product for a much higher markup... not the best quality plastic but good enough and i like it... sooo i say go for it.
5,So handy,"I am a little irritated because when I bought this... PINK WAS NOT AVAILABLE! :( But this item is so great that I will deal with black, but I wish pink had been available before I'd purchased this! The bags are wonderful but I would bring napkins with you also because for me its super gross to feel poop and you can feel it through the bags! I can deal with it but Id rather not! I clip this right onto my belt loop or the bag I carry and just pull one right out. This seems hard to do at first with one hand but the more you get the hang of it its much easier to hang on to a crazy pulling puppy and still take on right out of the dispenser. If you walk your dog this is a great idea. I HATE people who do not pick up their dogs waste. So buy these! I would leave the house all the time and completely forget to get a bag.. well what can you do when your already out? Nothing, how embarrassing! I keep this right with my dogs leash and harness and off we go and I have never forgot it!"
3,"Good, but screw design isn't a good idea","Love the product. Love having bags handy. However, the two parts of the bone screw together, and it wasn't long before that didn't work and the thing just popped open, bags spilling anywhere. I'll order another one, as this is a great product, but I'll try the regular rectangular dispenser and hope it closes up differently."
2,Black poop-bag dispenser,Very handy but not sturdy. The small loop (attached to the dispenser) broke off when I dropped the dispenser on my wooden floor. Good thing I purchased several dispensers (in various colors).
2,Going back to the red hydrant as this one won't stay closed,"I used to have the red hydrant bags on board sip tied to my boys leash. Had to replace the zip tie about twice a year. Saw this bone with the hook and thought hey, I like the hook. Well, the hook gets a little bump from the second leash in my hand and it pops open. And the end cap comes off too often. Had to re-roll the bags twice and search in the dark to find the cap. Then I just started putting single bags inside. Well, tonight was the final straw when I lost the cap yet again and no blue trail to follow to help locate it on 11 acres. Well, time to zip tie the old red hydrant back on.Nice try Bags On Board, but not for me."
2,"Mostly good, but breaks easily if dropped","I'm on my third one of these and will not being buying it again.The problem is with the design, specifically, that it breaks easily if dropped.The small loop attached to the main plastic bone is very fragile at the attachment point (which is very small) and, since it's part of the mold, cannot move. (it's like an ""O"" that attaches at the bottom, rather than an upside down ""U"" shape, as other brands have).It's also made of a more brittle hard plastic, rather than a more forgiving soft plastic, meaning that it tends to break rather than give under pressure.If you accidentally accidentally drop your leash with this thing attached (even a short distance from your hand to the ground), you'll probably cause the ring to snap off, rendering it useless.This happened to me twice already.Otherwise, it's not a bad product and works well, but until they address the issue with attachment ring design, I can't give it a full endorsement."
5,Makes carrying poop less unenjoyable,I bought this bags on board dispenser and it is a very good idea and well thought out. I haven't had a problem with it and would recommend this product.
3,"Neat looking, but larger than expected","Product is just as advertised and should come in handy on longer park/walk/run trips where the blue baggies are provided along the trail.Downside is that the little carrier thing is much larger than expected. It may look fine attached to the leash for a larger dog on a thicker leash, but for a small dog this may just look silly."
4,the standard for dog bags,"all my doggie owning friends have this dispenser, and pretty much everyone i see walking down the street with a dog has this one (i live in new york city)... easy to change the rolls, cute, functional. can't really go wrong. i've experienced the little plastic clip breaking a couple times (my friend's broke and so did mine), but it's thin plastic, so you kinda have to expect that with wear and tear. an easy fix: get a 99c keychain carabiner to replace it. works like a charm."
3,hard to detach,"we do not use that plastic container, it's a nuisance. Bags are leak proof and big enough -- they do their job; but they are hard to separate from the roll and then hard to open, doh..."
4,GREAT IDEA,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DOG. VERY CONVENIENT. NO MORE SEARCHING OR FORGETTING TO BRING BAGS FOR WALKS. I WILL RECCOMEND
3,Too big & bulky for medium dogs,We have a 43 lb Staffordshire Terrier mix and this is way too big on her. It ended up just hanging on our key holder and we snag one bag at a time from it. Oh well :/
3,well,nice convient and does the job have no complaints and see them a lot on walks they are convient and safe
5,Love this,We keep this on the dog leash now. It makes it easy to clean up after any messes and keeps the bags neatly contained without having to fumble in my pocket. It's very lightweight and functional.
1,Unable to open the clip,"Neither myself, nor my husband, nor a myriad of other people we have asked to try have been able to open the clip so we can actually attach it to the leash. This is useless."
2,Fine,"I couldn't decide how many stars; it's really fine. It's just heavy, and there are lots of other things like it that are nylon and less cumbersome on a leash. I keep it on my travel bag, where is doesn't pull on my dog's neck, but I have baggies with me when I'm away from home."
3,"Bags on Board Bone Dispenser with 30 Refill Bags, Red",The bags are excellent but the bone will not last long if the puppy or dog gets to it! As for show it is cute and the bags are excellent without the bone otherwise they are somewhat hard to get out of the bone!
4,Space Colony review,"Space Colony great space sim. i found this game to be alittle short but fun, download demo before buying any game, i dont have any game that i regret buying."
4,One Major Problem,"Space Colony is a fun, highly addictive combination of resource management and people sim but there is one major problem. Although the manual is well-written and contains a lot of useful information, if you enjoy ""roll your own"" campaigns you will find yourself pretty much on your own. The manual contains basic information on how to link two maps to form a campaign, but there is no information on how to use the menus in the campaign creation area. This can lead to a fairly high level of frustration."
1,Would give it 0 if I could,"I purchased this game new 3 weeks ago (not from Amazon)and still haven't been able to play it because it's stuck on ""create a user"". I have been back and forth w/ tech support, tried all their suggestions and have gotten nowhere. I suggested they refund my money, but they haven't acknowledged that."
2,"Hillman fasteners 8-11""","These plate hangers say they fit a plate 8-11"" but I couldn't stretch them to fit a 10"" plate & compared to some that I have, they were quite cheaply made. Very thin."
2,Not what I hoped!,"The only thing I like about this board is its size, it fits on top of my washer and dryer. The surface however is like a flat waffle pattern aluminum surface. The padding isn't thick enough to keep the waffle pattern from showing through on my clothes. I did try to put extra padding on it ( a thick towel) and that didn't help so I would not recommend this board."
2,Bad padding,"I agree with previous reviewers that this board definitely needs more padding, as the mesh pattern gets printed everywhere. However the construction is sturdy enough for the price and size. Generally I would not recommend it, unless you have a way of adding the extra padding yourself."
3,just soso,Again another rose quartz item that just doesn't have enough color. aside from that these earrings are well made...oh well
5,Colonial Mexico 2nd edition,"I think this is an excellent book. I was delighted to find a guidebook that focuses on such an under appreciated topic. It is well researched and well writen. It describes many of the major colonial towns in central and southern Mexico. It provides a brief history for each town, describes the significant buildings, as well as near bye attractions. The maps are accurate and easy to read. It will be one of the few guide books that I bring on my next trip to Mexico."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"I was looking for a good version of the Hungarian Rhapsody #2 and unfortunately, I did NOT find it here. It was probably the worst version I have heard. The dramatic intro was played at such a spastic and hyper speed that it could not be enjoyed. Other passages sounded rushed and even out of key at times. Sound quality was about average and recorded at a low volume. Was not the crisp sound I was looking for. I would recommend Hungarian Rhapsodies Vol 1., by Jeno Jando instead."
1,An Overall Outdated Disappointment,"I worked in Wyoming for several months in 2004 and bought this book for my ""weekend adventures in rock hounding"". I was and still am grossly disappointed with the book. Many of the sites that this book stated where on BLM or Forest Service land were indeed on private property. I thought that a more fruitful use of my time would be to visit the rock shops listed in the back of the book. Again, I was grossly disappointed. Many of the shops closed down, changed hands, or moved. Although this book was published in 1996, Appendix B was already outdated per some of the Rock Shop owners I did find. My recommendation is to find a phone book when you pull into a town, look under ""rock shops"", and call to see if they are open (or will open for you).Lessons Learned: If the black and white photos in the book use wheatback pennys for scale, the information included in the book may be as dated."
3,"A little dated, but........","The info in this book is a bit out of date--many of the sites have been very well picked over. I also find the directions to some of the sites to be quite vague, enough that, if it weren't for the evidence of high traffic and digging at the sites, one might not even be sure of being on the correct site (as I was not sure at some).All that being said, this is a useful guide for finding places to begin looking for specimens that may be unavailable to the casual collector. It gives a good jumping-off point from which a bit of exploration and careful examination might provide a less visited spot at which truly impressive specimens may lie undisturbed to be found."
5,Raymond Chandler meets M.F.K Fisher,"Richard Sterling's writing is like nothing I've encountered before in food or adventure writing--an amazing cross between Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled detective writing and M.F.K. Fisher's hymns to food and culture. This is one unique talent at work, someone you shouldn't miss. And lest I forget, in many of the stories in this book, he's funnier than Bill Bryson or David Sedaris--not just laugh out loud funny, but tears-streaming down your face funny.Perhaps the book is more of a guy's book, but I think women might find it a fascinating look into a man's life...exotic shores, strange meals, poignant friendships, wartime adventures, and all kinds of nonsense that men do indeed revel in."
4,Back to the Future,"An album combining current music with very ""hip"" older tunes.A real trip down memory lane with some classics or should be classics.Much to enjoy."
5,By far the BEST Classical CD I've Ever Bought!!,"This is better than Bach's Brandenburg's and his Orchestral Suites. Match the pieces on this CD to anything youve ever listened to and you will be smazed. All tracks are filled with so much power and energy you cant help but say this is divine music! Its well worth any price offered here, and it received my full recommendation."
5,Works great with many DA nailers,"I have a Porter cable DA250C Nailer.These nails work fine without jams.After much research, Amazon had the best delivered price."
5,"Informative, fascinating","This was the book that first introduced me to the world of fascinating cat breeds early last year. The other sections are excellent as well, with photos of wild felines you're not likely to see anywhere else. It also has sections on cats in literature, etc, and caring for your cat. A great book with heaps of reading to keep any cat lover occupied for ages. Highly recommended."
5,Beautiful!,This is a wonderful album - the music is beautiful and the piano playing is very moving. David Nevue is a very talented pianist. His styling of the music is unique.
4,Known and not so known,"I have not heard this yet,but based on Adoration, I am sure that this will have the same style. Some of these Christmas selections I do not know, but most of these are the old favorites that are such a joy. May these be a help to put your minds on Christ and may he remain in your thoughts as you go about your daily duties."
3,Not great,"I would really like this CD a lot if there weren't an annoying direction giver on it. He has a very monotone voice and tells you what to do the whole time. If you are a fitness instructor with any experience, you could do much better on your own. And he really ruins the chicken dance---anyone who knows the chicken dance knows that you don't nod your head and shrug your shoulders in it. Could be much better, I'm very disappointed."
5,Must Read,"This should a must read for all Americans. Never Forget all those who served, and the stories of good men and women just trying to do what's right to serve their country and protect their comrades."
5,enlightening and inspirational,"Countless stories of generosity, sacrifice and remembrance specifically from veterans, their families and people they encountered. Notable contributors include Colin Powell, Charles Kuralt and John McCain. Great stories about people in difficult situations during times of war. Heartfelt and inspirational."
5,Chicken Soup for the Soul,"This book is full of short stories by veteranns about veterans. I must recommend this book for anyone that has any affiliation to a veteran, simply the best, short stores from all wars and conflicts that will cause you to swell up with love and pride. This is a quick read and a must read, it certainly gave me pride to have worn the uniform. Mike - Des Moines, Iowa"
5,Monster's of the Deep!,"This is no ordinary shark film, but a glorious chance to meet some of the most beautiful and impressive marine creatures in the sea. The Bryde's Whale is a real standout; it is near extinction, and I know of no other pictures of this rare animal! Hats off to these 2 brave explorers and their amazing quest!"
3,"Fascinating, but needed a fact-checker","Great book, fascinating stuff, and the author's a terrific writer. But a couple of factual flubs (Florenz Ziegfeld's Florodora Girls? Jean Harlow died from an abortion?) had me wondering how much else I could trust in the book as ""history.""Read it for the great excerpts Israel's found, and for her own well-expressed opinions--but be wary of using this as a history text."
4,Witty bit of history,"Very witty, clever and well written -- a nice packaging of history. I wish it had dissected That Girl and the Mary Tyler Moore show just a bit more, but overall, it was very satisfying. Every bit as good as I had expected from its reviews."
5,They amazed me again :),"This album is fabulous..the first two tracks are so awesome. The whole album can easily cheer you up..and brighten your day :) This is happy, ""lift your spirits"" music..and SOS does it once again. Congrats once again to my favorite band of all time. You wont be disappointed if you buy it."
5,Amazing Swing Out Sister!!!,"It has been impossible for me to find another group that can compare with SOS, and this search has taken me more than ten years; they has created a music style by themselves, and this cd captures all the spirit of his music.If you don't know the music of this amazing duo, please take a few minutes to listen and you will not be dissapointed, and as soon as you get this CD I am sure you will be searching for the rest of the discography, this music, the arrangements and Corrine's voice are addictive!!Good news to all SOS fans, and to all the lovers of good music, do not hesitate in getting this CD. It is worth the price.The spirit of Kaleidoscope world is back, in my opinion: one of the best SOS albums."
4,Swing Out Sister 's Offering For 2004!,"This latest offering from Andy and Corinne (as well as pro-ducer, Paul O'Duffy) is a melodious melding of Bossa Novajazz, lounge music and signature Swing Out Sister. Thosewho liked the C.D.s Shapes and Patterns and SomewhereDeep in the Night will feel ""right at home"" with this new C.D.!The instrumental segues between some of the vocal trackswork out much better on this C.D. than on the previous C.D.(Somewhere Deep in ther Night). The outstanding vocaltracks include Love Won't Let You Down (an obvious choice for a single), the title track and Let the Stars Shine. The bestinstrumentals are the Latin-inspired Caipirinha and thelounge-influenced We'll Find a Place. Since there is a paucity of sales for recent S.O.S. C.D.s in both the U.S. andEurope, expect the Japanese import to be the only viable version available (and ergo, costly)! Despite the import price, I highly recommend this disc!"
5,They Deserve Five Stars,"Proving that great music still exists, SOS offer this little gem of quality musicianship. I have seen them live twice recently and they have not lost a beat. This is my favorite of their many albums."
3,One of the best SOS CDs,"This is my fave SOS CDs, this is the jazziest SOS ever.however I can't believe no one mentioned about the quality of the recording.The recording quality is very inconsistent. It varies from one song to another. Some of them are just very bad and dissapointing. And I feel it is unacceptable to be released.I bought 2 CDs of this, since I thought I got a dud (or maybe pirated) but they are all the same.Listen to the beginning of track 9 (We'll find a place), where you can hear that somebody just incrased the volume of some track and at the same time you can hear the hiss in the song.Track 11 (La Source) which is my favorite song of the CD, you can easily hear the bottom frequency breaking up and distorted.This is just shameful that a very good CD (with lots of good songs) is ruined with this bad recording.I hope SOS re-release this album and fix the bad recording on some of the songs in the future. Then I will buy this again (my 3rd one)."
5,Hot Link Pro is Great,Item works perfectly and controls all of my equipment without issue. Great way to hide your electronics and still have complete remote control.
2,Very good quality.,"This product is well constructed. However the quick release is not strong enough to hold this in place. If you are getting a rack with pannier supports, then you will have at least a few pounds hanging on this. I have no doubt that it can support the weight without breaking. The problem is that it shifts side to side and rubs the tire, even with very easy riding. I had to put a piece of rubber inside the clamp for extra grip and I have to use channel locks or a vise grip to help clamp it every time. If you are serious about wanting to have a rack you can remove, get a second seat and post. Then you can mount it permanently for the extra rigidity. If you don't need the pannier supports, then there wont be anything to rub the tire and the little bit of side to side movement probably won't be a problem."
4,Works fine,"I've used this for about a year now. It will indeed slip and rub on your tires if you don't get the clamp tight enough. It will also shift if you hit it with your leg while getting on or off. However, if you have the clamp on nice and tight it works just fine. I don't need any special tools to take it on or off.I have had a lot of weight in my panniers and the rack seemed very stable. Would I use it for a cross country trek? No, but it's fine for riding to work or around town on errands.The fact that it has a quick release is really nice if you use your bike for more than just commuting. I take it off on the weekends when I'm trail riding."
3,Pretty nice rack,Perfect rack for light duty. My needs were too much for this product and I replaced it with one that attached at the bottom as well as the seat post. The biggest problem I had was that even with a minimal amount of gear on the rack the center of mass on my road bike was over the back wheel which made it extremely difficult to maneuver when not on the bike i.e. getting in and out of my apartment building.
5,Excelente!,This was an excelent book for my theme of weather for my second grade bilingual students. Carlitos is a bunny who dresses a scarecrow according to how the weather is. My students loved the book especially because of the adorable drawings.I loved it because it was it flowed so beautifully between both languages.
5,Full Blooded Schubert,"Magnificently played and superbly recorded, and the two trios on one CD! There are flood of sounds anywhere. This is the very characterics of Schubert. Among eight movements the most impressive for me is the second movement of the E flat Trio. This CD has been 'buried alive' by an unduly biased review on Gramophone (Dec. 1977). Forget such review! In order to accomodate two works, three repeats are omitted. The omissions, however, are very carefully made so that they do not give any negative effect to the music. More serious is a big cut made by Schubert himself in the Finale of E flat Trio. It should be noted that the all recorded performances have been mede on this (authentically) abridged version. Strongly recommended."
3,For Period Performance Enthusiasts,"These are acclomplished musicians, and this is a good record, but unless you're narrowmindedly devoted only to period performances, you might want to look elsewhere for finer accounts of this music. Try Andras Schiff's current working trio, the earlier of two recordings by The Beaux Arts Trio (on a Philips duo mid-price set, coupled with wonderful string trios by the Grumiaux Trio), the bold readings by Arthur Rubinstein et al, or the Pablo Casals/Alexander Schneider recordings with different pianists. In terms of greatness, nothing compares to the ""historic"" recording by Casals, Corot & Thibaud. Also the Stern/Istomen/Rose pairing. All are better ways to appreciate Schubert's trios than the current item under discussion, although as I said, it's certainly not bad, and would be desirable if you only want that ""period"" type sound."
3,Bit small,"These shoes are on the small size for a 10. Fortunately my mother wears a 9 1/2 size, so she is happily wearing them. Disappointingly, Rockport don't seem to make a 10.5 in a Narrow fitting."
1,Dated Product,"This looks like it has been sitting in a warehouse for several years. Looks old.I ordered 2 pairs in 6W and 6XW - strange enough, the W one is WIDER than the XW pair.I returned both."
3,walking shoe,I had to return the item. But these brand of shoes are the best just didn't like the look of this pair.
1,wore only once,make sure they are rockports I thought it was undersold I was right the fit is terrible and very uncomfortable another bad choice. soles are very thin no support in the shoe.
5,Every year for the last 20 yrs I have bought Rockport Women's Marta Shoes. I love them,"My daughter bought me a pair of Rockport Marta walking shoes for my Birthday twenty years ago..They were the perfect size, make my feet feel like walking on pillows...smile. I love all the colors.These Marta Rockport shoes I got five years ago.........and they still hold up for my walks or everyday wearing.It has been hard to find now so am glad I found them at AMAZON.Thank you Rockport.....My favorite colors are ecru and black....."
2,Not what i expected,"always bought Rockport shoes for work, and the Marta style was my favorite, but over the years the shoe has change and is not longer soft and confortable anymore, wich was a big dissapointment as my feet are sore at the end of the day, won't be getting them again, sorry !"
5,Solving problems together,"Ernie Hudson is in tune with everyone in this film; he brings dignity to almost everything he acts in -- did you see him in ""Congo"" -- ""I'm your great white leader, escept I'm black"" favorite line. Jake is a story about a street guy who befriends an English guy and the question of ethics comes around. Lots of characters run though it. Would rate this a mild R."
4,Excellent Summing Up of all the Best in Game Shooting,"Mr Smith has written a very good book, covering many aspects of shotgun game shooting, guns, dogs, travel etc and combined it with a sense of humour, to produce a great all-round guide to the sport. Robert Churchill said years ago that anyone who averages 50% on game birds is a good shot. I wish I was as good as Steve Smith though he would never admit to being more than passable !! An excellent book."
3,OK Gate.....,"I purchased two of these to baby proof our home for our twin boys. At first I was really pleased. However, my boys started pulling on the gate and found out if they pulled hard enough it would open. This rendered the gate useless. I've returned both and am going to try a different brand altogether. Also I was really trying to avoid permanently installing a gate but I feel I have no option but to do so as the pressure mount would slip from time-to-time also causing the gate to be useless. The opening to walk through the gate is also quite narrow so it made it difficult when carrying laundry or really anything beyond yourself. Don't understand the amazing reviews as this gate is just OK."
3,Missing part of order.,"The baby gate was suppose to have a 3"" and 7.5 ""{ extension included. I order 2 of these and 1 of them did not have the 7.5 "" extension in it. Pls send ASAP"
5,works like a charm,Really impressed with the ease of installation and it fits the space perfectly. We have 3 small dogs and a one year old grandaughter - it works for all 3. Everyone can stay safe.
5,My grandson loves Caillou,I bought this for my 2 year old grandson who loves Caillou! He got 4 DVDs which he will watch over and over again. I was pleased with the price and the quality of the DVDs.
1,Not pleased,"I'm not pleased with this DVD. Too many ""puppet fillers"" and adds. My daughter also hates it; and I find myself fast-forwarding a lot. I should get my money back!"
2,Too many interuptions on video,My 2 year old grandaughter loves Caillou but she gets upset with all the interuptions on the video and shes crying cause she thinks its over
1,hate the puppets,my 2 year old girl cries every time the puppets come on between Caillou episodesI wish I could return this.will also check for puppets next time I buy a Caillou DVD
3,Beware...PUPPETS and ADs,My daughter (20 months) LOVES Caillou and this DVD is great except for the Puppets and Ads between episodes...I have to fast forward ALOT!! There are other videos out there without these distractions!
5,A Madoc Rhys and Janet mystery,"The second mystery featuring Canadian mountie Madoc Rhys. Madoc has proposed to Janet, but before they can make wedding plans they are invited to spend Christmas in a snow-bound castle in northern Canada. They are in for an old-fashioned Yuletide holiday with all the trimmings.Then the family's ailing matriarch dies during the festivities and the question on everyone's mind is, who will inherit? Quirky personalities abound, even an aging aunt who can see the Ghost Ship.Another death follows, and it's up to Madoc to decide whether it was a tragic accident -- or murder most foul."
2,Disappointing...,"Alisa Craig is clearly a capable wordsmith, and this mystery/romance has its points of interest, but her ability to plot a murder mystery is questionable. The denouement is completely absurd and there is absolutely no way the reader could possibly guess at the solution: Madoc Rhys does all the figuring in his head (making some amazing leaps of ""logic"" in the process) and Craig doesn't see fit to let the reader in on any of it. Our favorite aspects of this book were the characters Ludovic, a most erudite butler (with a shady past), and the clairvoyant Aunt Adelaide. It's too bad that the rest of the book didn't live up to these nicely developed personalities."
5,Previous reviewer didn't understand how to use them,"I thought at first they didn't work either. The thing is you must fill them ONLY to the fill line - that is 7OZ of fluid (less than 1/2 full). Any more and the cup will not work, it WILL spill if it tips over. If you follow the directions, and only fill it to the 7OZ fill line, the cups work very well. You can tip them over or hold them upside down and they won't spill due to the design (when the cup is laying down, or upside down, that tube in the top of the cup prevents liquid from getting out, but ONLY if you have less than 7OZ in there). They've been a great help for my mom w/parkinsons. They are very light and have a great handle that makes them easy to hold. I was about to order 3 more when I saw the negative review and decided to respond."
1,these cups leak,"I was searching for a cup for my 90 year old mother. She needs something that is spillproof and unbreakable. These cups leak. Right now, they are just taking up space in a kitchen cabinet. They would do for driving around town, if you don't won't to spill anything on your clothes, but a tumble to the floorboard would be too much for them. I found a thermos brand cup at Target that was wonderful. It is the size of an iced tea tumbler. It seals well and is quite attractive. My father, who doesn't really need a sealed drinking glass, was envious of my mother's target cup, so I bought him one too."
4,Golden Slumbers For Babies,"As an inveterate Beatles' fan, I say it is never too early to start one off with the Beatles!Prior to purchasing this, I listened to it as I am really particular about Beatles' covers and that includes instrumentals. I thought this sounded true to the Beatles' arrangement and thought the performances were gentle for lulling a little one off to Golden Slumbers. This is a refreshing change of pace from the melancholy Brahms Lullabye, which I never liked; the cliche ""Rockabye Baby"" which has a very short shelf life and the irritating ""Hush Little Baby, Don't Say a Word"" which I find for the birds.This is adult AND baby friendly and is sure to bring plenty of smiles and instill that Beatle love early, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
5,Love It!,This is a great CD for Beatle fans who want to introduce their children to the fantastic music of the Fab Four. The music is all instrumental and very calming for my little one. I would recommend this for anyone looking for soothing and happy music for their babies.
4,In Flander's Field,"A valuable book for those who wish to remind their children - and themselves - of the utter horrors of a brutal war. While not for very young children, it would be a great way to get one's family to think about war and its violence and, sometimes, its absolute necessity."
2,Check the website first.,A well-written and imaginative book - but it left this non WoldNewtonWebsiteJunkie completely cold. I should have read the reviews here and gone to the website first.
3,Better for the younger crowd...,"I'd have to agree with the other reviews suggesting that this is for a younger audience. The acting is pretty campy, and difficult to watch for adults. Also, we wish they'd spend more time showing the vehicles, and not focus so much on the corny dialogue. These videos are quite dated and that shows in the production value. If your children are toddlers, they'll probably be entertained, but if they are older or in grade school, I'm not sure this will keep their interest for long."
1,I would give it zero stars if possible,"I bought this dvd for my 2 year old son. After one tortured viewing we threw it in the trash. To begin with, Hard Hat Harry himself is difficult to watch--- he prances about the screen for an hour. Aside from his frolicking (to be polite about it), one hardly gets to see any trucks or other equipment in which a child would be interested. When you combine this with Harry's ""odd"" affect and genrally irritating demeanor, you end up with a video that it unbearably difficult to watch."
2,Front Cover is misleading,"The front cover image is AWESOME, but thats not the case for the rest of the images inside. They are very.....plain.... looking pictures that didn't inspire me like the front cover. Half of the book is male models FYI. Looks great on the coffee table though."
1,Not worth the money,"I feel strongly enough about the outrageous shipping cost of this product to write this review again. My last one seemed to meet all the review criteria, but was flagged - interesting. When I ordered this, it was included in a large order, so I didn't catch that the shipping cost was 7 times the product cost.It's standard sand - nothing special - and not worth that cost. You can find this at any local builder's supply for a fraction of the cost here."
4,Interesting Stories,"These short stories, about some of our best-loved Christian family members, are easy to read and especially interesting if you've already read or are familiar with some of their own work."
2,Found Faithful,"I thought this book was a book of mini-biographies of the people listed on the cover. In actuality, it's the authors opinions with references to the lives of the people mentioned."
4,Confused,"I just started reading this book. Dr. Gruber writes that Yohanan ben Zakkai is the one who sneaked out of Jerusalem and personally told Vespasian that he would become Cesar. But other sources I read attribute these actions to Josephus. What's up with that? Mr. Gruber does not mention whether the popular story of Josephus giving this ""prophecy"" to Vespasian is in addition to Yohanan ben Zakkai also giving it. It would have been good to clarify this point. Also no mention is made so far (1st Chapter) of Josephus fighting against the Romans before allying with them. Maybe Dr. Gruber is right about Yohanan ben Zakkai performing these actions instead of Josephus and maybe most others are wrong, but at least he has to deal with it since it is such a popular story and it is commonly held that Josephus did these things.Other than my confusion on this issue the book looks promising. So I will give it 4 stars for now and then perhaps rate it again in the future."
4,"Great Pearl Jam song for the film ""Big Fish""","This is the latest Pearl Jam single taken from the upcoming Tim Burton film ""Big Fish"" due out December 2003. Tim Burton, being a Pearl Jam fan himself asked the band to contribute a song to the movie so the band had an arranged viewing of the film and came up with the song and recorded it within five days (or so says Pearl Jam's official website). The song will be heard in the film during the end credit scenes. Song was penned by Ed Vedder and fleshed out with the rest of the band. Starts off with a nice clean tone guitar and just flows on from there like a slow build up wave and then gently back down again. Touching song to a loved one. The single version has two tracks, the main title and a demo version of the song with Ed by himself and guitar. The single version will also be on the ""Big Fish"" original motion picture soundtrack."
4,"Adorable and soft, but thin on bottom",Very cute and soft - well made and durable. Would be best for lighter pets (around 10 lbs) as the bottom is pretty thin & heavier dogs won't get much padding between them and the floor.
3,Fast food reading,"How do you fault someone for writing a book that the ""common man"" could read and understand? The constant barrage of self-aggrandizing/first-person anecdotes (i.e. 'I was the lone voice of reason testifying to Congress about xyz corruption.') doesn't fit in with the ""just a link in the chain"" most NASA engineers/astronauts espouse and is distracting from the facts. More importantly, a large percentage of this book relies on personal interviews with sources that insist on anonymity. Sure, some is to be expected, but when it becomes a significant portion of the source material it's a house of cards. (I considered leaving this review anonymous, but that would be hypocritical.) Finally, the entire book could be summed up as follows: Pages 1-351, NASA & Russia cannot be trusted to run a space program; Page 352, Space exploration is a worthy cause, so forget what I previously wrote."
5,"I don't play games, but this is great for Photoshop","I use Photoshop keyboard shortcuts a lot, and have several Photoshop actions I've assigned to keys. I've programmed the keys of this pad to enlarge/reduce my brush size and hardness, create an overlay layer, reset the tool I'm using, change to RGB, change to CMYK, fill with foreground color/background color and other shortcuts which used to require I let go of my mouse and press (for instance) shift-close bracket or Alt-Backspace. I also use that big round gray wheel as direction arrows which have many uses in graphics applications.The keypad has three ""modes,"" so you could have your Photoshop shortcuts on Mode A and other shortcut sets on B and C. This speeds me up and reduces the chance of my getting a repetitive stress injury."
2,Meh,"From the box it hookes up easy, programs like a charm, then..... Macros are iffy to execute and looping is questionable at best. Most my program keys worked just fine, but for some reason on both my xp and vista machine it would not let me trun right ""D"" key. I play a lot of PVP games.I havent given up on it, and it wasnt a total waste of money, but it did not replace (as I hoped it would my ""merc Zboard"". That is why I have to gie it a ""Meh"" for a rateing. I use it because I have it, but mabey a nostormos would have been better..... I wont buy another one, even at a yard sale."
5,"It's a winner, honest","NO HOME FOR SHANNON WAS the fourth book I ever wrote, and since then I've written 15 others. When I wrote this book, the name Holly Church came from a flute student I once had in Two Harbors, MN. I'm not sure where the name Shannon came from. To write the part about Shannon being mistreated by his trainer, I had to do research on how a Golden Retriever might be trained for work with birds and dog shows. The book has been very popular for over 15 years."
3,Treat dogs with respect.,"I have read a book called No Home for Shannon. It is one of the best books that I have read. It is very good and interesting because it is a happy story. It is a chapter book,not easy,and not hard, it is not scary, and not sad. It is a true story. It is about a girl who finds a dog that ran away from his owner because he did not care how his dog was treated."
2,Better than most solo albums,"This album is better than most solo albums. I gave it 2 stars, because it's not great. Three songs are good, the Dio song, Dee Snider song, and the Joe Lynn Turner song. The other songs are listenable."
5,buena recopilación,"BARON ROJO ES UNA BANDA EXCEPCIONAL. LOGRARON COLOCAR EN IDIOMA ESPAÑOL CON GRAN ACIERTO EL EMPUJE DEL METAL EN LA TRADICION DE IRON MAIDEN, BLACK SABBATH, DEEP PURPLE ENTRE OTROS. LA MUSICA DE BARON ROJO SUENA COMPROMETIDA, ENTREGADA, CUIDADA EN LOS ASPECTOS PRIMORDIALES DE LA MUSICA HARD Y HEAVY ROCK. ESTE COPILACION OFRECE 31 CORTES ENTRE LOS CUALES DESTACAN 5 NUEVAS VERSIONES. PARA TODO FAN DURO DE MATAR DE BARON Y PARA LOS QUE SE INICIAN COMO SEGUIDORES DE ELLOS ES UNA MUY BUENA PROPUESTA."
4,clasico del rock en espanol,"si buscan por rock en espanol. baron rojo ha sido uno de los fundadores de el, no es agresivo,ni pesado es deleitable y se distingue por tener so sonido muy origina. mis canciones preferidas son siempre estas alli, beetoven etc. yo soy amante del rockt tanto en ingles como en espanol. escuchenlos"
4,A powerful story,"The story of a young girl growing up in Iran in the 80s. ""Forrest Gump"" let me see history through a fresh innocent set of eyes and I found ""Persepolis"" much the same. No one should have to live in such an environment, much less a child, yet Satrapi has so much hope, so much fire and spirit in her. Such and enlightening and powerful story."
5,Beautifully written - Azadi Bareya Iran,"Like ""Maus"" and the story of the Holocaust, Persepolis brings the sad story of the Iranian Revolution to light in a way only a well-done graphic novel can do. It is an absolutely brilliant book that gives you the raw pain and emotion of the Revolution, with all the necessary facts and events, without the dry and verbose nature of many historical novels. Rarely can it be done, in pictures, like it is done here.If you truly want to know the sad story of the Iranian Revolution from the perspective of an average Iranian family, this is the book for you. Please read it."
4,An excellent comic which sorts through a mess of timely issues viz modern Iran,"Oh dear. Issues of post-colonial modernity? An examination of the role of women in a Muslim society? A tale of youthful rebellion against theocratic rigidity? A parable of how the personal and the political often tragically intertwine? It's got all that and more, and it's a comic?! I don't think its possible to not like this book. I can see this becoming the new ""Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down"" for the college book club set. It is a genuinely touching piece of work. It will probably appear on survey's of world literature and post colonial studies syllabi for years to come."
4,Non-Fiction,"An autobiographical account of a girl growing up in Iran. Through her own story she highlights how deeply screwed up the country is, and has become, and how ludicrous some of the religious laws and commands are, when you see them through the eyes of a child. Wear something on your head? It is too hot, stupid! That sort of thing.She is not holding back, talking about how people feel when their 18 year old next door neighbour is executed as being a communist, after a leftist lead revolution allows them to take power, or when your uncle's sister is strangled to death because he was not home to kill, and things like that.She points out other crazy things that we probably are not aware of, you can't have chess sets, in Persia? That is very freaky.The art style is quite cartoony, which is somewhat jarring when she is talking about firing squads.Definitely good."
5,My first graphic novel,"I never thought that a ""comic book"" would have so much heart felt information. My Israeli friend suggested I read this book as it had touched her with its depth of heartfelt storytelling. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who had any interest in life in Iran after the religious clergy took over and for those who are looking for a point of view of the Middle East that doesn't hit you over the head. A special book in this time of war, nukes and hate."
5,The story of a generation,"Persepolis is the story of I and many many other people who grew up during late 70s to late 80s in Iran. It is an entertaining story, yet a realistic and unbiased history lesson. For me it is like the story of my life and I can connect with it 100 percent. And from the comments by other readers, it seems that even those who are completely unrelated to the events and circumestances described in the story can connect with it easily."
5,"deep, and honest","As an iranian who has lived in similar years as Marjane is talking about, I could totally relate to what she says...This book is so refreshing, deep, and at the same time simple ... I could not put it down, and forced my self to read less so I would not have to wait too long for the second volume to come out... But no, I finished too fast and I'm waiting now... maybe I could start reading the french version..."
4,A comic strip for all ages,"This book traces the life of young girl growing up in turbulent times in Iran, beginning with life under the Shah, moving on to the revolution and continuing through the Iran / Iraq war. The girl narrates anecdotes from her own life that provide a thought-provoking window onto the way these events affected ordinary individuals. The choice of a comic strip to portray events of such significance and tragedy has some disadvantages, one being the limits it places on the possibilities of characterization. On the other hand, there are also numerous advantages. The illustrations can at times be quite powerful, the simplicity of the format is used effectively to highlight the stark brutality and poignancy of the events portrayed, and perhaps above all, the graphic novel format makes a story with such important themes accessible to people of all ages."
2,school,"Used this book for school, I personally didn't like it, but It was helpful for that class. Not my cup of tea."
3,Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood,O.K. for those who may prefer illustrations than written accounts. As a result this was disappointing for me. The book is in excellent condition.
5,Very nostolgic,"This story is nicely depicting the true events happening in Iran after revolution. I, as a person who grew up with the same situation, totally enjoyed reading this book.I strongly recommend this book to every Iranian (or non Iranian) who has left Iran, and been through the bloody war."
5,A So True Storey of a Nation,"This book is an amazing memoir that very simply even narrates the most delicate points. I personally do not agree with the revolution part . It has bee totally her personal experience and understanding that all the people in Iran were happy the time that Shah left and revolution succeeded and I do not agree. But after the revolution took place . Oof .. I go so well with the book. I can imagine each single moment of it . The most touching part was the last page when the book fell off my hands as I was crying bitterly! It was the storey of me in Mehrabad airport, You in Mehrabad airport , any body who had to leave the country, home and the warmth of the kindest parents in the world for the sake of a brighter, more optimitic future as a youngster .. which in turn is the destiny of a generation in Iran."
3,Fine,"This book was a very easy read. Unfortunately, the plot was a little too easy to follow, and certain parts have nothing to do with the rest of the book. The illustrations, however, have a quirky charm, and the story telling is sweet and entertaining."
1,Inappropriate for the young - cursing,"I had intended to use this in my class, because it was well recommended. However, after previewing this book I was hugely offended at the thought young teens would read this. There are several, very nasty, curse words and an illustration that depicts a man's privates as he urinates on a prisoner. I understand the need to make the torture known and to stay real to the moment, but that took it too far. I DO NOT recommend this book be used for young readers. I love books like ""Night"" by Elie Weisel, because even though it is graphic in its description of the horror of German prison camps, it does not become crude, merely factual. ""Persepolis"" could have left out those cruder elements and still been a book of interest when showing a changing view of Iranian politics."
1,Don't Recommend,"I didn't like this book. Sometimes you only need a bite to know you won't finish the whole meal. That's how I felt about this book.Maybe I'm not a graphic reader, but I do like The Snowman book. I wonder how it works on kindle."
2,Interesting but...,"It's beyond horrible that anybody has to grow up in that scenario, especially children! The problem I had with the story is that I found the main character pretty much unlikeable. I have children so I am aware that kids aren't exactly a big bundle of tactfulness but telling another little girl that her father is probably dead is reprehensible. If you factor in that she is 9 or 10 and not 5 or 6 years old it makes her comment seem more hateful than tactless. She also came off as taking pleasure in other people's misery. I didn't like her parents either. Considering all the turmoil in their country I was pretty much astounded that they decided to take a vacation for just the two of them while leaving the daughter behind. I can't even imagine parting from my children under those circumstances."
2,"A quick, okay read...","Persepolis follows the life of the author as she is growing up in Iran amid wars and uprisings. Told in graphic novel form, it reminded me a lot of Maus, the only other graphic novel I had read before. Personally, I liked Maus better, but this could be because I read both parts of Maus, while I have yet to get my hands on the second volume of Persepolis. In its own right, it did teach me lots about Iran that I didn't know before, and I was interested enough to want to pick up the follow-up. Maybe I'll like it more after I get the whole story."
5,A Female Perspective,"At first when I opened this book I was completely skeptical. The first thought that crossed my mind was, ""Really? A GRAPHIC novel?!"" Still, it came highly recommended, so I gave it a go.This book is a necessary female voice on the Muslim history and experience in Iran. It is witty, whole-hearted, and sincere.This book is great for bookclubs, ungrateful teenagers, women, friends, anyone wishing to understand Iran, etc.Makes a great gift. I found it to be more compelling than the film."
5,School,The book was long and full of different details but it was good. I was in good condition and served its purpose of a book report well.
4,"Like MAUS, a graphic intro to political tragedy","Simple, beautiful illustration and humane tone characterize this introduction to a human tragedy, the Iranian revolution of 1979. Satrapi is a young woman of Vienna and Paris now, but grew up spending age zero to twelve in Iran. PERSEPOLIS is her testament to the crimes committed first by the Shah and then the thousandfold worse crimes created by a revolution which was supposed to address the problems."
4,A compelling graphic novel,"This book was so enveloping that I ended up reading it in one sitting and often returned to it later to look over all of the great images. Satrapi's black and white drawings evoke wood block printing and draw the reader into the initmate world of her family and neighbors as they cope with the drastic changes in their society and its effect on their social lives and education. The author is honest and up-front about her privileged upbringing, which in no way detracts from her legitimacy to tell the story of life under under the theocratic regime. ..."
3,GREAT VALUE!,This item was purchased because my chair at work was not working out for me. My boss designed and had a circular type desk made. A regular size chair with a back did not fit well in my area. This chair is perfect for the area that I work in and the design of my desk. The price fit my budget and WHO can beat FREE shipping?
1,great product....poorly constructed,One wheel broke off the second time it was used. The stool cushion is very comfortable and they had even built in an air port in the cushion to allow the air to release when you sit down. Too bad that the wheels and legs are only made of plastic!
3,Beware of Iffy mechanics,"The stool is comfortable and rolls well however the up and down feature is broken. I submitted a request for return within 30 days of ordering the stool and was denied with no explanation. So, I am stuck with a stool that is too low for me to use as intended. I am very disappointed in the customer service end of this deal."
4,Absolutsly great,"Works well, really comfortableFor kids what I do is take off the wheels so that the thing doesn't go around all over the place"
5,Great product!,My LMTs love this new rolling stool! It has a very lush cushion and a great product for a great price!
3,Won't stay up,"I bought this for my sister, a massage therapist, and she has problems with it falling and not staying put in the height she needs it sometimes. The air goes out and it sinks at weird times which is frustrating for her. She is on the heavy side, but this is advertised as a heavy duty high weight limit stool and really isn't. Other than that the construction is good and the wheels roll very well. The seat is comfortable and sturdy. Watch out if you go to pick it up by the bottom, the shaft is VERY greasy and will get all over your hands. This probably adds tot he problem she has with getting it to stay at the height she sets it."
4,Great way to rest from standing while doing chores,"Nicely constructed stool. However it's a little light so be sure to use the handle when sitting to be sure the stool does not slide from under you while inclining to sit,It has really came in handy when I'm trying to prepare meals in the kitchen."
5,Master Massage Adjustable Rolling Stool for Massage Tables,This light weight black stool is attractive and rolls easily. It is safe for hardwood floors. The height adjusts with just a touch. And it wipes clean.
3,soft seat,"I purchased this stool to use with my massage table and portable massage chair. It is very light weight and moves around very freely. The only thing I didn't like is that the seat is a little too soft, so it doesn't keep you centered on the stool."
1,Garbage,I bought 4 of these for a busy chiropractic office. I only weigh 165lbs and have had 3 of them break on me. The wheels just buckle out from underneath the stool. Piece of garbage.
1,Disappointed,"Was excited at first site & feel. The cushion is very well padded & comfy. Right away though, I noticed it was hard to roll on our commercial carpet. (Don't have this issue with other stools in the office.)We had only had it in the office a week when my associate sat down on it & 2 of the legs broke right in half near the wheel canister. Couldn't believe how defective it was. I'll spend $20 now for an Earthlite or similar product."
5,Perfect,"Very steady rolling stool, great product, I definetely recomend it to anyone that works long hours like i do. Another great experience with amazon.com"
2,"Stool is fine, Casters are rubbish","Got this a few months ago. It lasted 2 days. After a day of use on a thinly carpeted floor (commercial carpet, no plush here), 2 different casters snapped making the chair unusable. Item returned."
5,Excellent Stool at an Excellent Price,"This stool is very comfortable. It's well cushioned and well balanced. Rolls easily, even on carpet. I use it about an hour at a time and I am always comfortable. (This is not the usual for me with other chairs.) I have no qualms recommending this product."
4,A Seat for My Seat,I'm very pleased with my new stool. I am a Hydro Colon Theripist and this new stool sets my new room off very well and is very comfortable. I was very pleased with the timely manner in receiving the stool.Teresa
4,graeat deal,I am a new massage therapist. I would suggest this item to anyone... even those who are not in my profession
4,Does the job nicely,"I've been using this stool for a couple months now while doing Reiki and it is working great. It moves easily and is simple to adjust. Seat could be a little bit more cushioned, but is still comfy for the hour at a time that I use it. It was super easy to put together. I definitely recommend it."
4,Gift for husband,"He likes it. The top is a little too large, That is the only reason for 4 out of 5."
2,disappointed,"I was really dissapointed that this chair was delivered with a broken wheel, because i was planning on using it to wheel me around the house , I was happy to have a full refund without shipping charges."
2,lasted for only 2 years,"We've had these chairs for a couple years...they were great for a bit. Unfortunately, the plastic on wheels have broken off. We had two, the first one's hydraulic system broke within a 6 months. The heaviest person that sits on them is skinny! Great while it lasted, but after 2 years we have to replace them. We do use them 6 days a week, but I am hoping to find something more durable. Our main office's chairs have lasted 6 years with no problems. I would probably not buy them again. If you are only using them sometimes and don't mind replacing them later, I'd go for it."
1,Rolling Stool,The stool arrived damaged. I sent an email and received a response withing 24 hours saying the problem would be resolved and I would receive an answer as to how we would get a new stool. Three days later I still heard nothing so I sent a second email. Again no response......I understand that things happen and people are busy but you are only as good as your word. This stool was given as a gift and it was very embarrassing to say the least when the gift was opened and 2 legs were damaged. All I could do was aplogize and let them know I would work with Amazon to get the stool replaces.
2,Not worth it,The seat itself is comfortable but the legs will break if you weigh more than 115 pounds. My husband was sitting on it and rolled to the other side of the desk and 2 casters broke.
3,Serves the purpose,"I needed a chair and it is that. No problems from it, and it serves the purpose for my needs."
2,Quality of wheels not good,We ordered these for our physical therapy office and had to return them immediately. The wheels easily flex and can get caught and suddenly stop the stool - creating the potential for injury.
1,Dangerous junk,"Read the reviews on this, and noted the one about sinking 5"" when sitting on it, but though that was exaggerated. The stool arrived quickly, and it looked OK putting it together, although the base was made of plastic.Sat on it for the first time, and thought it felt very mushy and wobbly, more so than thick foam could explain. Got up and looked at the base, and the legs had bent, and two of them cracked through. The plastic is very soft, and unable to take any amount of weight. I'm lucky the legs didn't snap off entirely."
4,rolling stool review,"The stool is very comfortable and easy to move around in. I chose it because I needed something for a tight space that didn't have a back to it that would scratch nearby surfaces. It has met my needs. The only thing I wish it did better is if it had a broader range of heights (I could use it to go a little higher, but its low setting is good). This is my fault for not accurately measuring my needs before buying it."
3,it works but hang on,"I bought this product after reading a review from a woman who had trouble with low back and doing chores in the kitchen. I wish that I had purchased one with a back because I am afrid of falling off. it rolls nicely, but my husband who tried it out first, warned me to hang on to the bar as the stool rolls away when one first sits on it.I'm still not cooking up a storm but it does help me in the morning when I'm so stiff."
1,leary,"when i opened up the ""new"" packaged stool, i saw that the part that holds the wheels had scuffs all over it and it was dirty!! not what you expect for being new and wrappped up. Besides all that rubbish, it does its job, so far."
4,simple to put together and use,"The stool arrived and was put together in just a couple of minutes. It is comfortable, rolls well even on carpet. Simple and functional."
4,NICE Quality - I'm mobile again!,"I read a review on here while I was looking for a rolling stool -- someone with a disk injury (like mine) who had problems standing more than a few moments and with the help of this stool she is cooking again! I understand completely! I can cook - load the dishwasher - fold laundry from the dryer - VACUUM, etc. with the aid of this sturdy, rolling stool. Great value for the price - super-easy assembly. Really thick and cushy seat!"
1,P.O.C.,"We used this stool in our frame shop for about 3 years. It got an average amount of use but never abused. No one in the shop is very large. One day the plastic base just broke in half sending the occupant sprawling to the floor. Luckily he wasn't hurt. If you want a good lawsuit stool, this is the one."
4,Excellent !!!!!!!!!!,"I love this massage stool. Its extreamly comfortable, very easy to move around my table. The base is surprisingly much bigger than most of the massage stools. It was very easy to assemble and was delivered in less than 24hrs.Definitely a THUMBS UP to this product"
1,Very Dissatisfied,This stool broke within the first week of use! The lift stopped working right away and within the next week the plastic legs that hold the rollers collapsed and cracked. To ship it back would be throwing more good money away. I am not a happy customer at all.
1,Weak,"I sit on a stool all day most days, so I am a bit tough on stools, but this one has held up unusually poorly. About 1 month into using it the height adjustment lever broke off at the weld. The seat has come lose a few time in the last 5 months, and now one of the wheels just broke off. 5 months, and its trash now."
5,Funny and Factual,"This is hilarious and informative. It seems these days politics are best taken with humor, and Mr. Wuhl delivers plenty of laughs while giving us useless trivia that could come in useful at any party! I would love to be in this class. I'd recommend Professor Wuhl to anyone interested in American History and Political Science, or just if you want a good laugh or want to know a bit about how we will survive as a society in spite of our politicians!"
3,A crash course in more ways than one,"ASSUME THE POSITION WITH MR. WUHL presents actor Robert Wuhl enlightening students about pages missing from their history books. It's fun and entertaining with just two drawbacks.First, ASSUME THE POSITION relies too much on audience shots to edit segments. It gets distracting seeing smiling student after smiling student.Second, as this is supposed to be a television series, why are there only two episodes of ASSUME THE POSITION?But for what it is, I'd rather have ASSUME THE POSITION WITH MR. WUHL than not. Here's hoping Robert Wuhl does more of these. Or perhaps there could be ASSUME THE POSITION: THE MOVIE - it would have to be better than SEX AND THE CITY: THE MOVIE."
1,JUST BAD,I cannot stand this series. He is not funny and the two episodes suck. The best thing is when it's over. Mr Wuhl looks like a doof and is distracting. He tries too hard to be funny and comes off like a tool. My life would be better without this show ever being created. I have to watch it because it's so bad. Then I scream at the TV because the jokes are so damn bad! Gladly HBO never made this a series.
1,Try Hard of an Effort,"Sad I cannot go lower than a zero. I hate Mr Wuhl's special. The jokes are so bad. All he does is cite events and try to attach those events to current pop culture. For example, he talks about writing sequels and says, ""it's like Outcast trying to follow up Ms. Jackson with Hey ya!"" it's simply not funny. He then talks about Israel Bissel and compares the warning to PAul Revere by suggesting Revere was chosen because of his name. This idiot then sings, ""While I tell you a tail of Israel Bissel!"" Again simply not funny. He walks in during the beginning with his chest out and looks like a complete tool. His dress annoys me. Jeans with a button down shirt and a sports coat. I hate his dress in the video. I hate his hair. Please stop airing this on HBO. Then stop selling this bad comedy. He is not funny. I hate this show. Best part is when it's over."
5,As American As Apple Pie,"Wuhl is brilliant. You'll love this review of American History, unlike anything you will find on a college campus....yet it was done on a college campus"
5,90210 Forever!,"Every true fan needs this DVD on their shelf at home!!! This is the beginning of it all, the friendships, the relationships, the breakups and makeups. This dvd is the true beginning to every 90210 fan out there! Get reintroduced with your friends from that famous zip code! I have been a fan of Beverly Hills 90210 ever since they aired this first episode and it was this episode that made me forever a fan of the show! Who knows if they do real well in selling enough copies maybe the entire series will start to come out on dvd!"
4,A must have,"Love it or loathe it, this show was a hit for my generation (and the Fox network). Here is the begining of 90210-mania in all of it's (comparatively sugary) glory. As a retro bonus, the late 1980's/early 1990's fashion is a total scream."
3,PLEASE PLEASE RELEASE COMPLETE SET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi I'm Kelly from Chatham, Ontario, Canada. I just want to say that I have boughten the piolet episode of Beverly Hills 90210, and to tell you the truth it was not what I expected. Yes I really enjoyed seeing the show again, but it just was not the same , it had no extras or anything. But my main question is WHY ON WHY HAVE YOU NOT PUT OUT THE COMPLETE 10 SEASONS ON DVD YET, NOT ONLY IN THE STATES PLEASE WE CANADIANS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT TOO. I WATCHED THE SHOW FROM THE FIRST EPISODE TO THE FINAL ONE AND I REALLY MISS SEEING IT. IT USED TO BE ON RERUNS BUT THEY TOOK THOSE OFF AS WELL. I KNOW AT LEAST 100 PEOPLE THAT WOULD DEFINATLEY BUY THE COMPLETE SET. SO PLEASE PLEASE GET THIS OUT FOR US. I SEE ALL THE OTHER DVD BOXED SETS AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH SOME OF THEM ARE PRETTY STUPID!!!!!! BUT THEY ARE IN BOXED SETS. SO PLEASE GET THIS OUT FOR ALL THE BEVERLY HILLS 90210 FANS. THANKSSIGNED A TRUE BEVERLY HILLS FAN....."
5,"90210 best t.v. show, i grew up with this show",90210 is one of the only shows i look back and remember watching every week. i am sure many people would agree with me. i would love to see the entire 10 seasons on dvd. i know i would buy them and all of my friends would too. please put this on dvd.
4,Great (But No Luke Perry In Pilot Episode),It is great to see that they have put theBevery Hills 90210 pilot episode on DVD.it is truely a great show.But before youbuy it i have to tell you that Luke Perrywas not in the pilot episode. I know thisbecause i have it on video. He was in thesecond Episode series in the shower. thatis when they first showed Luke Perry.Thanks. (...)
5,French version PLZ,"Hello, i'm french and i would like to order this DVD in French Version or with French SubtitlesPlease do it for French people !!!Merci beaucoup"
1,stupidest show.,"Just like the OC, rich kids r portrayed as having many many & many problems. I was in my teens when the series aired. Even when i was a teen, I thought to myself, ""this is the stupidest show ever and so unrealistic."" Every show portrayed the actors has having problems after problems. Examples : my mother whose a famous fashiion designer is a crackhead, my friend played w/ a gun and accidentally shot himself dead (this was the stupidest episode by far), my friend died during a drive by at UCLA, i'm a teen and i have breast cancer, i'm a drunk, i'm a drug user, we moved to 90210 but my mom is a housewife, my father forces me to work even though i'm rich and i live in Beverly Hills. Whoever wrote the series doesn't know anything. Yeah, a mother whose a housewife in Beverly Hills. I remember a show where the group went to a underground rave and they didn't even play the right music for a rave scene. Stupid. S-T-U-P-I-D."
3,Very Small Bag,"This bag is really small for my E-Volt 500. I have two lenses, flash, two filters and I carry all the cables and charger. When I place all of these items inside its really cramped, which is not good thing. I think that I need all of this when I am shooting anywhere. You never know what you will need. So when I bought this I was looking for space more than everything else. The fact that it brought the warranty, the remote, and lens cloth was just a plus for me. I'm not really satisfied with this bag, wished that it was bigger. If you care about space and carry a lot of stuff with the camera then don't buy this unless you are interested on what it brings. In my opinion its better to buy the remote separately if you are covered, and buy a cleaning kit for slr cameras in any electronics store (RadioShack $10). I bought my camera in Circuit City with the protection. So I am covered. But for some people that are not covered this kit would be wise to buy to extend their warranty."
3,Too heavy,"the shells are nice, but overall these earrings are really heavy and hurt my ears after wearing them for about 30 minutes."
4,"Dazzling technique, she's grown up as a musician since","It's an interesting recording for fiddle afficionadi. She has a wonderful left hand. Her vibrato in the double-stop passages is unusually rich. But she was a kid when she made this recording; the one to buy is after she turns 40 and has lived a little.If you love the Sonatas and Partitas, I can say without reservation that the recording to own is the Milstein made when he was 70, in the last year or two of his life (a two-CD set from DG). I cannot conceive of how he could be so technically perfect at that age -- intonation, rhythm, everything is flawless. But the reason to own these is that Milstein had lived them for nearly all his life and poured so many ideas into them."
2,Sounds like MIDI files!,"Her sound and technique is nice, however her tracks sound like MIDI files and patched together! Also, her chaconne is ridiculously slow and can be so boring! I prefer the Bach of Laura St. John to Ms. Hahns because she shows more signs of life in her playing. For definitive Bach, try Oscar Shumsky, Szeryng, or Menuhin!"
2,Too young to play Bach,"I found this CD to be clear, in tune, and boring. It is technically good, but mechanically played. While the opening to the E major partita is wonderful, it doesn't move after that. I recommend Lara St. John's CD-she captures the essence of Bach as if she were born to play it. If in ten years Ms. Hahn records the Bach again, I will buy it, with hope that being older enables her to understand these amazing works of art. I don't doubt she is a wonderful player, but I think that on this CD she sounds immature and too young to play Bach."
1,Boring and mechanic,"While listening to this album, one thing comes to mind: a robot playing a violin. Moreover, Hahn's playing shows no emotion or spirit of any kind. She sounds as if she's afraid to break away from the confines of perfect rhythm and tempo, and for a work such as this, it is fatal. Bach's work was made to be played with expression, passion, and in that degree she has failed miserably. She may have good tone and time, but beyond that, not much."
5,Bach would be pleased,"A wonderfully honest, refreshing performance of Bach's solo violin pieces. What is particularly impressive about this CD is that techinque, musicality, and sonic quality converge beautifully. I am astonished that I haven't heard of this violinist before. Bravo!"
3,"good, but needs improvement","I agree with Reviewer Liz that solo Bach piece take a certain amount of artistic skills as well as personal maturity in order to be interpreted in its grandeur. This young violinist certainly has very fine technical skills, however, the 1/2 notes and 1/4 notes are lacking in confidence, consistency and a musical abandonment sort to speak; which leaves the listeners wanting. I think Hilary should re-record it 10 years from now for comparison as she acquires more depth and understanding of her own appreciation.I first heard the Sonata 3 played live by Midori, and have since learned that she will come out with her own recording of Bach in the next while. If you want to hear Bach in its full sustaining power and beauty, I suggest you wait for Midori's recording and not settle for something amateur."
2,Boring,I didn't like it.It was pressured upon me by all the aggressive advertising but I've heard much better Bach. Either Kanterow or the much hyped disc of Lara St John is much more satisfying. This girl plays well but it sounds heavily edited and disjunct.
3,bread baking,Really quite involved to make each bread type. Think beyond me. Great quality used book. Most receipes are pretty time consuming.
2,No standard measures,"How could anybody think of a bread baking book with no standard measures? Most recipies are using ""cups"" and ""tablespoons"" which makes it just very unprofessional!Not at all content about viennoisseries!Don't buy it!"
5,contagious enthusiasm!,Praises to the author! I could not imagine this book is so full of contagious enthusiasm! And her tutorials are really easy to follow. Real enjoyment!
3,too much for one meal,I bought many bread books before this one. Because I want to make bread from sourdough therefore I choose this one. Over all this isn't a bad book. But I think the recipe call for too much for one meal. It call for 6 to 7 cup of flour.
1,Not it.,"I thought I had found the secret to making delicious artisan sourdough bread. I made the starter using grapes but sadly the bread was not up to my expectations. This book turned out to be a waste of money. The secret to the bread I am looking for wasn't in this book. I have tried Ed Wood's book and starters, the special Baparoma steam pan, etc. but am still searching for the perfect bread."
1,complete failure,"boring writing, boring recipes. u.s measures.just another old book. don't waste your money like i did."
3,She has her own style,"I think she sums up this book herself when she says that the people in her neighborhood had to ""get used"" to her style of bread. It's good bread, yes, if you like black, thick crusts and don't mind waiting a few days. This is good for the elevated baker who wants to perfect themselves, (my pastry chef side) but my kids want bread they can eat peanut butter and jelly off of. It's not worth the price, so check it out of the library first."
2,Not worth the money.,"If you like to look at nice, glossy pics of bread rather than really bake, this is the book for you. While Silverton no doubt produces some of the best bread out there, her book leaves much to be desired. Her recipe for starter will have the unwilling participant end up with something like 7 pounds of starter!!! And, she specifically says not to scale it down. Ridiculous. Also, the yeasted breads in the cookbook all call for compressed yeast, which is next to impossible to find anymore. Why does no one use it anymore? BECAUSE IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS ACTIVE DRY AND INSTANT YEAST!!! But Silverton has to make it difficult, as some bread masochists think difficulty is necessary to produce good bread.If you want a good book on bread, buy Reinhart's ""Bread Baker's Apprentice."" I feel it will probably be a classic in no time. It is, without exception, the best book written on bread baking. Ever. The recipes all work, and every step of the process is explained in great detail."
5,the authority on sourdough bread,"not a lot to say.buy the book.make the bread.ahh!worth 5 stars.- - - - - - - - - -My favorite book on bread. I have 5. For several years, I made 2-3 loaves of bread every week using this book. I'm currently on hiatus from bread-making, but I need to get back to it!"
2,Too Complicated,This book is too complicated for the home cook. It's hard to make even a close facsimile of the La Brea Bakery breads without a special commercial steam oven. The degree of complexity is not warranted by the final result.
2,Not for the novice,"La Brea Bakery produces an amazing product that I hoped to duplicate (or at least make an attempt) at home. Although I feel very comfortable in the kitchen, I was very intimiated by her lengthy home made starter instructions and thus her book has sat on my shelf unused. Unless you are willing to make the costly and time consuming starter, this book is of no value."
3,Interesting...but not very uesful in the kitchen,"Its fascinating to read Nancy Silverton's story of baking and developing her craft, however, her recipes are not easy to follow or clearly laid out. This book is for reading and learning from rather than using in the home or commercial kitchen. In trying her recipes I've found I need to rewrite them following a form I developed from reading Peter Reinhart in order to make the baking and prepping process flow smoothly. No pics-except those on the inside cover. No formulas and the recipes are written for environmental conditions that I won't ever be cooking in (dry cool CA in a temp regulated place). However, that said, her recipes and breads are wonderful and delicious. It just takes some time and energy to make them workable in the kitchen."
2,Decent reference - major snob appeal,"Despite her protestations to the contrary, the author is a snob with too much time on her hands. Maybe she has two or three days to spend on a batch of bread, but as any baker knows, you can produce delicious, satisfying bread in a fraction of a day. Don't be fooled into thinking you have to undergo her rituals to ""take your baking to the next level.""At one point she compares yeasted bread to to cake mix (because its so-called inferior character). What rubbish. Yeasted bread has a fine history and great character. There are some useful tips, but you needn't go to the trouble she demands to make great bread. Her obsession with the topic is overwhelming even to experienced bakers. It's hard for me to imagine that she has any fun baking or serving bread..."
2,Nancy Silverton's Breads from La Brea Bakery,"This is a book for retired professional bakers who get up at 6 AM and retire at 12 midnight. How does the author expect any real person who is not Exphedra or other stimulants to keep her schedules on a one person/baker basis? If I had professional bakers working around the clock, I would not need her cryptic recipes. I would live in Malibu!Sad sticky fingers down!"
2,Its a disappointment...,"This book was written like a novel, alot of description and lacking pictures (only the finished products on the back of the book covers and some (less than 10) between pages, its a good book for those that like to cuddle in front of a fire place with a hot coco. Also a good book for those with good imagination. For those that want color pictures to show you every step of the way (like Wayne Gisslen), sorry, this is not the book. There are many great recipes (that is the only reason that prevented me from giving it a one star), but like I said,....its almost like a recipe book written by Stephen King. Readers should have some basic knowledge about baking before reading this book. Definitely not for beginner!"
2,uses white flour in all recipes,"I was disgusted to look at this book, which i just got but haven't used.All the recipes contain white flour!!! The author is not my kind of person and it's not my kind of bread. I'm a no-compromise whole grain adherent. I read labels in the store, and anything containing white flour, i don't buy. I haven't touched white flour for decades.I was looking for a smart author to figure out ways of dealing with whole grain flour; she didn't even try; she quit before she started. Thank goodness there are are amazing new whole grain bread books available!"
3,Time-intensive but a good read,"This book was very interesting to read - particularly about why wild yeast, resting the dough, and other bread-making processes are so important. It fired me up to make bread as my summer project. I spent the requisite 15 days making starter that appears to be bubbling and healthy. Alas, none of the 3 batches of bread I have made with the first, simple recipe will rise! I am willing to chalk this up to beginner's difficulty, but Nancy does not provide a trouble-shooting section that could help me tweak my process to get optimal rising. This is frustrating and a great loss of money in terms of the flour invested!"
5,Sixties Classics,This is a great cd with Arthur Fiedler at his best with his Boston Pops and a good tranfer of the analog tapes to the digital format recommended to all fans of the old Boston Pops.RegardsIan.
3,"You, I","I always liked the song ""YOU,I"". In 1969 You It was a fairly often played radio song. Hard rock, kinks-like riff, Iron Butterfly-like vocals, and 60s style psychedelic lyrics...""you...are the color blue, and i'm looking through, at a magic hue""...ah, something like that. Good song, played along side Green River by CCR and Fire by Hendrix. God, I loved 60s radio.The rest of the album sort of just played along...but it was a nice listen once in a while. Glad I saved my copy. Don't think I'll try real hard to find a CD copy though."
3,Definitely Dark.,"This seemed like a promising book at first, but reading it quickly became a chore. For one thing, there are no likeable characters; everyone, even Nathaniel, is cold, calculating, and arrogant. The only truly nice person is Mrs. Underwood, and she has only a minor role. The writing tends to get bogged down in long, drawn-out descriptions, and in my opinion, the story drags on a lot longer than it should have. After making it most of the way through the book, I finally tossed it aside because it was so depressing; apart from an occasional chuckle at Bartimaeus's antics, there were almost no ""up"" moments in the whole book. The situation seemed to get grimmer with every page. As other reviewers have remarked, this is DEFINITELY not a feel-good fantasy story."
3,"Definitely not an outstanding book, but somewhat enjoyable","After reading the Harry Potter series, it is hard to write fair comparisons in reviews of books in this genre. Rowling is a master storyteller. After reading the Amulet of Samarakand, it is obvious that Stroud is not. However, it's not a bad book....just a bit above average, but well below the quality of Potter.As the negative reviewers have pointed out, there is a complete lack of characterization. I too felt that the main character was a stranger. I did enjoy Bartimaeus, but the book overall lacks that spark I am constantly searching for in between Potter books.It's worth a read, if you get into it with the right expectations. Don't expect to be blown away, but you probably won't be disappointed, either."
3,Doesn't someone have to be likeable?,"We like Harry (Potter)We like Lyra (Golden Compass)We like FrodoWe like Luke, Lazarus, Retief, Ged, etc.Whose to like in Amulet of Samarkand?"
3,"Good storytelling, but not appropriate for children.","If parents are worried about Harry Potter's occultish undertones, they should not let their children near this book. It's basically about summoning demons."
3,Mostly Satisfied,The copy I received is in perfect condition only it isn't the same cover. Thought that should have been mentioned in description of book.
3,good book but i have read better things.,The Amulet of Samarkand was a realy good book and I realy liked itbut it was not the best book I have read.I inca 7 years
3,It has a certain appeal...,"It took me a while to get into this book; I found Bartemeus's footnotes a bit annoying, I wasn't too impressed with the writing, and the plot was okay. But after a little while, I got caught up in it and couldn't stop reading it. I just wanted to find out what would happen next!One thing that kind of made me nervous though, was the fact that in this book, the source of magic is demons, which kind of sounds like the controversy surrounding the Harry Potter books. I wasn't very comfortable with that, and especially with the fact that in this book, most magicians seem to be ambitious and self-centered. Not very good role models for children. Parents should probably read this book before allowing their children to read it."
2,Very slow and monotonus reading,"The author begins his story slowly, continues it through out the entire book until the last 2-3 chapters where the pace picks up for a dramatic scene and a complete let down ending. I was excited to begin this book but as of this point in time, I have no desire to finish this trilogy because the meat of the book was slow, boring and non eventfull."
2,Amulet of Nothing,"I was excited by the premise of this book but I must give it a bad rating since nothing really happens in it. Having a djinni serve a young magician is a great idea but the author does nothing with it. The djinni does nothing exciting with his powers and the young boy magician is a snivelling bore. It seems many are trying to write the new ""Harry Potter."" Many are trying and many are failing...but they're getting published anyway. A total mystery to me. So, avoid this book and look for your young adult fantasy elsewhere."
2,It HAD potential.,"I think this book would make a great movie. While Harry Potter directors are agonizing over the amount of great material left on the cutting room floor, I think that there is only about 2 hours of decent material in this entire book, so it would make a director's job a piece of cake. I kept waiting for it to get exciting, riveting, even ""not boring."" It never did."
3,Didn't like the hero,"This book is a near hit due to its incredible creativity, but misses due to two main mistakes. First, the ""hero"" boy, Nathanial, is a self serving creep. His entire motivation is REVENGE. Ugh. Hardly admirable. I didn't want to cheer for him and wouldn't have even minded if he failed in his task of stopping the bad magician. (I didn't see Nathanial as much better than the bad magician. They're both egotistical, revengeful creeps.) The djinni is great, however. Loved him. The second problem with this book is that it's incredibly wordy. When Nathanial attends a fancy event, the book spends four pages describing the drive there and PARKING! I kid you not! Cut to the chase. There was a paragraph-long description of a door (yawn). A good editor should have shortened it to heighten the tension and excitement. So . . . I recommend it if you like long, wordy novels with revengeful, self serving heroes."
3,Decent read,Fun read but not anything I'd say I'd recommend. Seemed like every other fantasy wizard book out there that I've read.
3,Ok,Rather too descriptive for my taste but a good book. Characters we easy to get attached too. Nathaniel or John was easy to follow. The djinn was a bit to harsh.
5,Refreshing fun read,"I wish Mr Stroud and other writers had more books like this. It's a fun read. As a few other readers mentioned, it's not the often repeated Tolkien copied fantasy. The footnotes can make you laugh as he explains things as if they are truly for real and make perfect sense. The character development is excellent and you'll quickly feel a keen liking for some and a distinct dislike for others drawing your interest into the book. I rarely find myself wanting to stat up at night and read but this book did just that. Enjoy!"
5,For Both Boys and Girls,Great series for young and old alike! Stroud is able to bring to life this unique world of wizards and demons/spirits. Bartimaeus was surprisingly very witty and sarcastic - a refreshing narrator (with entertaining footnotes!). Stands well on its own separate from Harry Potter.
4,"Fabulous, witty, and oh so EXCITING!","Nathanial is a troubled young apprentice of Arthur Underwood. He attempts to seek revenge on a powerful magician who, in the past, embarassed him beyond human embarassment. So, Nathanial summons a djinni(or demon) to steal a valuable divise from the magican. With doing so, he discovers a secret so dangerous, he himself has to suffer immensly for meddling with it!Johnathan Stroud creates a new world of magic that no other writer has been able to create. Combined with wit and intelect, this writer has quite a future ahead of himself!"
4,The Amulet of Samarkand,"I agree with most of the reviewers comments, including the comparison to Harry Potter (for good or bad). I only want to add that due in part to the success of JKRowling and the Harry Potter series (as well as the reincarnation of the Hobbits via film), wizardry and strange tales of mystical children has become a viable topic now being tackled by later-coming authors. Hooray for Harry Potter, Eragon AND Nathanial!! May they give rise to other adventure stories that will enhance the entertainment and love of reading for an ever-growing base of young people."
4,I love Bartimaeus!,"Stop your browsing and buy this book. Jonathon Stroud gives the world of fantasy his own unique twist. In his world magicians cast spells to do various ne'er do well deeds, but the spells don't magically go out to do their business. No, the magicians must work through a second party namely an imp or a djinni or an afrit or some other creatively named creature. The creature does the biding of the magician. The creature also has a mind and a will of its own. So part of the fun of this book is the tug of war between the magicians and the creatures. The spotlight magician in this book is a young boy named Nathaniel. He summons a creature named Bartimaeus. Bartimaeus is a wise-cracking, sarcastic, drippingly funny sideman who is the energy in this book. So stop browsing and buy this book."
4,1/4 of the way through and looking forward to the rest,This is a witty book. I enjoy the footnote format as it adds to the arrogant personality of Bartimaeus. The sentence structure at times doesn't match the pace of the story and can seem a little tedious but overall holds my attention. I like the stab at JK Rowling early on and I'm sure she'd appreciate it as well. I am not sure if the constant back and forth of flashbacks and current action make the overall plot (a la Pulp Fiction) accessible to children but I'll wait to see when I've finished. This is a great addition to children's fiction or for adults like me who are a little discontent with adult literature at the moment.
5,Possibly the one of the best books ever!,"I usually not interested in the fantasy genre, I mean really, you read one and done, right? WRONG! This book completely dominates all the competition of the ""magic wizardry"" stuff, and is a must read. I've read it at least a dozen times over the years, and find another hilarious, witty comment to ""lol"" about. I curse the name of those 1 stars, don't be led a astray! Its a must read."
1,Not Recommended,"Well I just I can not recommend it. On each page there are explanatory footnotes to references made within the paragraphs that are altogether more interesting than the story line. Bartimaeus is some kind of ultra powerful demon, djinn, or spirit that gets summoned by a 12 year old and sent off to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand - lackluster adventure ensues. I would not recommend this trilogy to any of your younger relatives. Very disappointing."
1,"Magicians portraited as evil, selfish and vindictive","When I read this trilogy was a combination of Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl I bought it immediately, and it was a huuuuge deception. The trilogy is awful, I hated it, it has none of the charm of the Potter books nor the cleverness of the Fowl books.Magicians are portraited as evil, selfish and vindictive, who use magic solely to their own good. Magical beings are their slaves, forcely brought to this world to obey the magicians orders, which may vary from cooking to delivering mail to killing their enemies.Did I say I hated it? I would give no stars if I could."
1,side bars irritating,"The premise for this book was interesting, but the style was so cumbersome. I could not get past the first few chapters out of pure annoyance with all of the sidebars and the writing style."
1,Broken amulet,"Is it me or is it written like for 1st graders but with violence for no reason? He turned into a mole, oops no he turned into a fly, ooops no he turned into a worm, oopns no he turned back into a dink. What kind of writing is that?"
4,Not what I expected!,"I heard that this book was really good, came highly recommended. I was a little skeptical at first about reading it, but I gotta say, ""WOW"". This book is really really good. I couldn't put it down. I adored Bartimus humor. I highly recommend this book. Can't wait to read the next two."
4,not as grown up as Harry,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been trying to find books in the meantime to carry me until the next book is released. I bought this based on reviews here, as well as The Today Show. I found the footnotes throughout the book extremely distracting and tiresome. In most cases, they could have been incorporated into the text and sometimes were repititions of what the author had already stated. Besides that though, I thought it was an enjoyable read, but I felt like I was reading a pre-teen to teen novel, which I never felt while reading Harry Potter or even Eragon. I did enjoy a new spin on the ability of magicians, in that, they had no power without summoning of spirits or demons. Almost a genie in the bottle approach. It will be interesting to see how this series continues and I will most likely get the second book. As for recommendations: either get a used copy or borrow from a friend if you're an adult. Or read your child's after they are through."
4,Lots o' fun - intrigue from the side of a djinn,"The Amulet of Samarkand introduces us to Nathaniel, a young aspiring magician in a world run by magicians, and the petulant, but lovable djinn Bartimaeus. All adventures are told from the viewpoint of Bartimaeus so there is a lot of commentary on the human world from a supposed outsider. This side of things made the story interesting to me due to the fact that the entirity of Earth in this book is being run by a group of people who are exploiting ""non-people"" to stay in power."
5,My review,"My favorite book is The Aumulet of Samarkand. I like it because its like Harry Potter, They use a lot of magic, But it doesn't get boring or unrealistic. It's about a boy named Nathanial who is trying to get revenge on somone by stealing the aumulet from him. He studies hard and learns the spell he can use to summon a Jeanie called Bartimaes. This is the best book of all time. It wont disipoint you like Harry Potter."
3,Ahh...mediocre,Comparing this to Harry Potter or saying its a dark Hary Potter isn't fair. It is okay as stories go but not so great. I would read something else if I had a choice.
3,"Did not ""connect"" with any of the characters","This book was hard to get into because I didn't really connect with any of the characters. Neither the boy or the djinni were especially likeable, which made me on the fence about who to cheer for throughout the book. It seems the theme is not about good vs. evil, but lesser evil vs. greater evil. Maybe I went into it hoping it would compare to Harry Potter, my mistake. More than likely I will not read books 2 or 3 of this trilogy. Sorry Bartimeus. :("
5,Drop what your reading & start this today,"I was thrilled by this book! It was so different and refreshingly imaginative. My husband and I both enjoyed this book and the rest of the series very much! If you like fantasy adventure and are looking for book that is wonderfully written with unforgettable characters then buy this book. The ""voices"" of Nathaniel and Bartimaus are singularly memorable. The wit and the struggle/respect between these two make the books very enjoyable. We listened to this series on audiobook and the narrator made it incredible. I can't recommend this enough and I frequently do, for both teens and adults."
5,The Amulet of Samarkand (On the quality of purchase),"Purchase was shipped in a timely manner. Lower price than if bought in store, even with shipping included. Book in excellent condition, slight damage to bottom of dust cover (most likely due to shipping). Very good purchase, 5 stars."
3,Good read but there is better.,"This was a fun book but not in the traditional sense. The author does become fairly verbose, unnecessarily at times but all in all it was a fun ride. This title is a bit darker than the usual story line you find in this genre. I found myself becoming slightly annoyed at the whole ""the world is against me and I can't win"" tendency of the writing."
3,"Good, but..","This is a good to average book, not a must-read though if compared to Eragon, Harry Potter or a Funke book. What is impressive and bit disturbing is the main protaganist who is not like those butter will not melt in the mouths types. A bit foolish, unrepentant and sometime silly. Not looking forward to read Goyem's Eye which has fetched worse reviews compared to this one."
4,The Amulet of Samarkand (the Bartimeus Trilogy Book 1),It was an interesting and exciting book. The mystery of each chapter made it an exciting read.
3,"Bartimus good, story bad","Mediocre story, good protagonist interesting spin on the world of wizards and their training. Will not read others in the series"
3,the amulet of samarkand,"Can't recommend this book ,Could of been a lot better.Got tired of trying to stay with story.Deffiently for children only."
4,An Amazing Thriller,"This book is a thriller in which eleven old magician Nathaniel summons a djinn (demonic spirit)far beyond his supposed competence. During this book, the author switches off between the perspectives of Nathaniel, an eleven-year-old magician and the five thousand-year-old djinn Bartimaeus. these switches can make the book confusing, along with the occasional flashbacks, but once you get the hang of it, the book is much easier to understand. This book is full of attacks, plots, suprises, and cunning people. In a nutshell, I would say it is an excellent, action packed thriller that will leave you hanging until the very end of the book. I would recommend this book if you like thrillers that can end in despair, happiness, or both at the same time."
4,Highly Original,"This book is a breath of fresh air. It's something new, not a ""traditional"" fantasy book. The Amulet of Samarkand is a a book that all fantasy lovers should read. It's unique, entertaining, and funny. There are parts that I could do without, but on the whole it is a good book that is worth reading."
5,Highly Recommend,"Jonathan Stroud has written a masterpiece. This book is full of great characters, it is filled with humor, action, adventure, fantasy, more humor, and a little drama. This was surely a unique and wonderful book. This is not another wanna be Harry Potter Book, as I was afraid it might be, this novel is really new and refreshing from all the tragic Rowling impersonators. I highly recommend for any reader who enjoys a great, quick, and exciting read."
4,Good,"The first book was pretty good, but I got really tired of reading the little quotes from bartimaeus on every page.... Don't waste your time reading all three though. By the last one I hated the book....and the ending!"
5,highly original book,"I'm a science fiction/fantasy fan and read books like shannara, harry potter, lord of the rings, bartimeaus, and eragon. This book was highly original in the power of magicians. It's not just like using magic to do everything and being in secret from non-magic people. the structure of it is cool because of the way it has two main charaxters and switches views. Since magicians don't actually use magic, (they summon demons and the stronger the demon, the harder he is to control so you need to be a strong magician to control strong demons) Bartimeaus is actually the one with all the power, not Nathaniel (the magician). I loved the ending of the book because of the strategic plans the main characters come up with. BOTTOM LINE-------- if you're a fantasy fan, READ THIS SERIES."
5,BARTIMAEUS!!!,"Bartimaeus is a great story! Nathaniel, an 11 year old magician, gets himself into a big pickle when he takes revenge out on another magician who humiliated him in public. In doing so, he summons Bartimaeus to steal the magician's mysterious Amulet of Samarkand. From there, he gets wrapped up in murder, mayhem, and all around good stuff to keep you busy and wanting more! My favorite character is Bartimaeus, a witty, clever, and funny djinni. And I mean funny in every sense of the word! ^_^"
5,Terrific Book,"Bartimaeus is a really well-written, very imaginative and often very funny book. If you like the books of J. K. Rowling, or Phillip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" series, or Garh Nix's ""Abhorsen"" books, then this is a book you shouldn't miss."
4,Harmoniously Catchy,"This is an excellent CD. The parts are each sung very well, and the harmony is strangely pleasing. It's a tad too weird for me in a few places, but generally each track is very interesting, unique, and catchy. Speaking as a 2nd bass, if you love to sing I'm sure you'll find this CD worth your time and money."
5,Great voices!,Im listening the record rigth now.Its an excelent and soft music.Its the modern barroque!the best voices actually.
4,circlesongs,This is a unique expression of Bobby MeFerrin and provides an interesting and unique listening experience. It is freeform music which is disciplined and provides a joyful expression of the human spirit. Very entertaining and different. I really enjoyed the sound and the experience. This is truly a Bobby McFerrin creative expression to be enjoyed and valued.
3,Cheesy DVDs but it does keep my 3-yr olds attention!,My 3 1/2 year old really likes these. The DVDs were made in 1995 so they are pretty old though.
4,Enteraining for toddlers,"I ordered this because my grandson watched the Firetruck VHS over and over, and it finally got ""eaten"" by the player and destroyed. Now he enjoys all 6 of the DVDs."
3,some good songs,"The Santana Twins are keeping it Old school style, much props to them for that. But I miss the edits and the mixing aren't always on the spot. plus I would love some drum machine's instead of breakbeats all the times, the vocals amuse me in some of the songs (Checkout Rosario - Runaway, and Noland - Angel Eyes) but most of the singers has a good vocal ability."
5,GREAT in every way!,"Ordered two rings, both are gorgeous! Love the way the rings are set. Stones are beautiful, and very clear! I get alot of compliments on both! I recommend the rings to all A++++, and seller is top notch too!"
3,Stones not very clear,"The ring does have nice ""architecture"" as one reviewer noted, but the drawback for me is that the stones aren't clear, they are somewhat slightly muddy/hazy. If the stones were clear it would be a fantastic ring"
3,A Marine in Vietnam.,"I have read a lot of Vietnam war paperbacks. Hardwick did a good job for his first book, and I generally enjoyed the read. However, there are many of these books in the book stores. This is the first one that I have read which takes the point of view of a forward observer for arty. I learned some new perspectives from his point of view. Generally in all these books, America puts its young men (and women) at risk. We need to be careful if these policies are just.Hardwick came to hate the war. He did some pretty stupid things in the war. One was targeting the farmer with bombs. The farmer and his water buffalo may have been in restricted territory, but that didn't give him the right to drop a bomb on him. Hardwick came to realize the hopelessness of this war. An OK read of the Vietnam War."
3,Pirate Vendor Warning,"I ordered this through Amazon from ""Nova Rose LLC"" and got **Pirated** copies of the DVD. So the $45 cheap price isn't a legal copy. It looks to be a VHS transfer to DVD-R media, there are ""pause"" icons at the begining of some episodes and digital error due to the transfer. Amazon did refund my money and I hadn't expected to see this company on their site again, but they're still here. I'd just like to warn folks that want a legal ""manufactured"" copy to not order from Nova Rose llc. Hopefully the other vendors that have it for $79 will be legit manufactured versions of the episodes."
1,Seller is probably selling pirate copies,"Seller novarosellc is probably selling pirate copiesof Ultraman TV series in DVD (dubbed from some ancientold VHS tapes). You will see a lot of this typesof products in eBay.If you are Ultraman fans, priate copies might bebetter than none. Just be aware. Ask the sellerbefore you buy.In Japan the real things are slowly coming up, butthey are in Japanese. Quality of image is of cause verygood. If sellers can pirate that version and combinethe English tracks from the old tapes, that would besomething (excellent image but poor audio)."
3,i wanted it for my dad,i just wanted to get it for my dad but without a credit card i couldn't. if u can help me email me
2,Pleasant at best--hardly what Mozart deserves,"Ormandy was one of the most recorded conductors of all time, and during his long tenure at Columbia he made LPs of basically everything, only to repeat himself a good deal in his waning years on RCA and EMI/Angel. But don't worry about finding Ormandy in his prime: he had none. He was an exemplary model of bland, routine conducting masked by a velvet blanket of smooth orchestral sound. No wonder his recordings droped out from sight and only resurface now on negligible budge reissues.HIs Mozart is limp and bland, without the slightest interest. At least ou won't waste much money if you want to hear for yourself. A non-starter."
4,Works best in conjunction with GoF Design Patterns,"This book reminds me of the 'Numerical Recipes in <x>' books. They were the thin adjunct books that accompanied Numerical Recipes which showed the examples implemented in various languages. The books were no good on their own, you needed Numerical Recipes to understand them. This book has the same problem. It doesn't introduce the patterns from scratch, it assumes that you have read the GoF book and that you can use it as the base source material.That being said the author puts together, succinctly, with both diagrams and code, C# examples for all of the GoF design patterns. Even though in some cases there is very little code because the patterns have been integrated into the structure of the .NET framework.I think this book is worth a look for anyone writing C# on a daily basis and who is a patterns fan. It's something you need to evaluate before you buy because, frankly, you may already know most of what you are going to see."
2,Good material but very poor book design,"The first thing you should know is that this book is not really intended to teach you the GOF patterns -- read the GOF book for that. That said, it does do a decent job of translating the GOF patterns into C#.My main gripe, and it is a big one, is that this book is *very* difficult to read because half of the relevant material is in the form of ""challenges"" whose answers are in an appendix at the back of the book. Please note that these ""challenges"" are not supplemental exercises that can be skipped -- they contain key information that is needed to understand the implementation of the pattern. Having to jump back and forth on nearly every page make the book almost unusable."
3,Not good for self study/reference,"This book may work well in a human-taught course but I down-rate it for self study and reference. I found it tedious because content is spread over several pages when it could have been effectively presented much more concisely. The flow of information is interrupted by frequent ""Challenge"" exercises with solutions in the Appendix: normally I would applaud efforts to engage the reader's thinking, but although the challenges were pretty straightforward checkups on understanding I found them very distracting. When I am trying to learn something I really want the content presented directly and clearly up front."
5,Design Patterns in C#: A great book!,"This book is very well and clearly written, with to the point examples and figures.I enjoyed reading it, and even more enjoyed learning new patterns, and recognising some of the patterns I already did use (though without knowing it had a name).The book contains lots of ""challenges"" or questions, and if you try to answer them, you really get to understand the pro's and cons of every patterns... Of course, it contains all the answers, so you can check if you're thinking the right thing.Steve, please continue writing about the other 77 patterns :)"
3,Challanges (Quizes) should be included on the same page.,"I just read a few chapters on it. The way this book is written is that the author shows you what each pattern is and then challanges you with ""Challange"" questions. I hate those challange questions since the answers are in the back of the book. Flipping back and forth to check the answers interrupted my thought process so I gave up on the challanges. I wish the author includes the answers right after the each challenge. I bought this book to learn, not to be challenged, been challenged enough during college already. Anyways, if you like to read books with quizes and challanges between sections or chapters, then I guess this book might be for you."
2,Unnecessarily laborious,"If you're a ""notch above beginner"" in regard to patterns (like me), then this is not the book for you. How strange that something as concepually simple as patterns can be so difficult to weave into applications. This book doesn't help. Steve chooses to use an arcane fireworks company as the standard example and then adds unnecessary complexity by incorporating complex code. (At one point, Steve goes into the calculus of fireworks trajectory!) Very frustrating to struggle with the application of patterns when the sample code itself is mindboggling.Every once in a while I pick the book up to remind me how incompetent I am. I don't like books that make me feel that way.Look into O'Reilly's ""Head First Design Patterns"" instead."
3,Not a substitute for Gof Design Patterns Book,"Well, I have to say after reading most of the book, that it's not what I expected. Being very familiar with ""Design Patters"" I was hopeful that this book would give some concrete examples in C#. Instead, it's more of a text book that asks you to fill in the blanks. This type of book is useless as a reference.Get the real ""Design Patterns"" book. It's more of a reference book and is something you will keep on your desk for a long time to come."
4,Good support for a Flugel...,"I like the fact that with this stand, the center of balance is low, making the instrument less likely to be knocked over. Shame it's not compatible with the peg adapters and stand as well---you have to buy the Flugelhorn peg as well."
4,high quality chant and polyphony,"This is a relatively high quality chant recording from 1995 in Germany in collaboration with a TV show, with 2 CDs and some polyphonic settings as well. It features some seasonal hymns--not just the usual chant ""propers"" for each Mass--for Advent/ChristMass, Easter, Pentecost, and the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (including a collection of infrequently recorded Marian chant hymns). The set includes 2 CDs (of over 57 minutes each and 35 total tracks) with a 71 page booklet with commentary and lyrics in four languages: Latin, English, French, and German. An above average chant release, this is definitely not your cheap Canadian rerelease of a burned LP recorded in the 1950s with a reel-to-reel recorder. From the back cover: ""This recording contains beautiful examples of Gregorian chant essential to the celebration of the four principal feasts of the liturgical year."""
5,"safe, positive reinforcement and patience in trick training","As a dog trainer im used to programs involving positive reinforcement and this one does it. I have many of the dvds from this program and love that allen uses treats, praise, verbal commands and also shows you how to help the horse who isnt getting it or holding it. You can easily adapt his methods to clicker training as well. I think maybe the 1 star review may be refering to how to help the horse lower in the obesiance position if luring isnt happening. There is definitly not a roping into submission dvd. There are some things in horses you may not be able to freeshape even after attempts with food luring. He shows how to progress that horse in an EXTREMELY gentle way that is all about the horses comfort and safety. Allen and his horses have a friendship and working relationship that is amazing and trusting and i have no idea how anyone seeing his work could think otherwise."
4,Pretty shoe,This patent leather mule is really pretty but it's a little narrow; might consider trying the next width up.
2,"High handicappers, beware!","Great 460cc driver, for the price, no matter where you buy it. But, if you are an average golfer (28 handicap or higher), it is HIGHLY unlikely that you will able to ""handle"" the 10 degree loft with this club. You will be in the right rough or woods or opposing fairway most of the time!"
4,A NICE COLLECTION OF STORIES,"THIS BOOK IS A LOT OF SHORT STORIES WRITTEN BY TERRY PLUTO, A WRITER FOR THE AKRON BEACON JOURNAL. IT COVERS LOCAL SPORTS AND PERSONALITIES FROM THE CLEVELAND AREA. A VERY TOUCHING ONE CONCERNS HIS FATHER AND MOTHER. HE IS ONE OF THE BEST WRITERS IN THE CLEVELAND AREA. I HAVE READ MANY OF HIS BOOKS AND ENJOYED EVERY ONE OF THEM. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE INDIANS, BROWNS CAVS AND LOCAL CLEVELAND SPORTS THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TERRY."
3,Works Ok,"I wasted a lot of abrasive media (ticks me off) as no instructions came with it (at all). Worst part is once I got it to where I think it should be, hey it doesn't work all that well (at all). Northern could test one & print & include instructions (good company I've always had luck with prior anyway); not rocket science (to take care of your customers) to do & considering the amount probably sold from reviews on this. All aside, I once had a 12v cleaner that I still cannot find to re-purchase that worked (and cheaper to use & buy) so much better."
1,Contemptible,"If you buy this and you are not a collector of kitsch you are simply a fool. If you make such a product you are contemptible.$225 is food money, it is medicine but it is certainly not appropriate for a child's plaything. This item should be removed from Amazon and ToysRus. This is wrong on a number of different levels.Charles J. Budde"
2,At-home moms beware!,"Figes' intolerant views towards at-home moms and her prescriptive approach seriously undermine her stated goal of supporting all new mothers. She describes at-home moms as `selfish' and damaging their children. Even as a non-mother whose mom worked outside the home, I was annoyed.There is no need for this sort of divisive criticism. To make matters worse, her criticism is disguised as helpful, comforting advice. Nonetheless, parts of the book interested me.Instead of this book, try Nina Barrett's ""I Wish Someone Had Told Me: A Realistic Guide to Early Motherhood"" (1997) for an even-handed approach to the same issues."
1,This Book was horrible! I would not recommend it to anybody!,"This was the most depressing, exaggerating, pessimistic view on motherhood I've ever seen. I think there are much better books out there that offer a realistic view on birth and motherhood - without comparing it to a ""near fatal car accident"" Keep looking!"
4,A great introduction to mississippi!!,"What a fun book!An A-Z snapshot of Mississippi for kids and adults alike.The book,illustrated by the author,introduces the reader to Mississippi treasures like B.B.King and kudzu in a simple rhyme format."
3,"Great concept, but takes a lot of work","I thought these ""wild""flowers could be established by simply scattering the seeds where you wished them to take root. Unfortunately, that idea was too good to be true. As always, there's a lot of work in gardening, and these wildflower packets are no exception. Not good for dilletantes! (like me)."
1,Poor,Within a week of use the string holding the scrunchy part to the stick just wore out and it all fell apart. I had to buy a new scruncy and use better string to attach it. A simple product but needs to have a better way of fastening the scrunchy to the stick.
4,Sidekick II Bumper Kit,Wonderful product. Now my husband and I know whose sidekick is whose! :) I really like them and the colors are great too!
1,very bad edition,"Regardless of what one may think of this film ,it deserves to be decently presented on dvd .Cheezy Flicks does not help the cause of film restoration with this type of dvd transfer .The one star is for the product not for the film .Cheezy Fick 's edition of Corman's Atlas in Pan and scan was a disaster too.They of course are not alone in that line ."
2,THE BEST ...OR WORST?...OF OL' JOHN,"Good flick for some laughs.The price is right...about eight bucks,the same amount they spent making this horror western. John Carradine said it was the worst movie he had ever made...Don""t know about that John...I""ve seen you in some pretty bad movies. Be aware that this is a pretty lousy print transfer, not exactly Criterion Collection quality."
1,Save your Money,"Unless you're addicted to Hard Copy or for some reason enjoy reading books by self-indulgent parasites who overstay their welcome, there's no reason to read this book. There are plenty other books out there with far more insight and much more credibility. But if you're really a Beatle scholar, you already know that. I hate having to give it even one star."
1,Will Someone Please Drag This Woman into the Present?,Was there ever any Beatle hanger-on more pathetic than Francie Schwartz? She has taken a fling with of over thirty years ago with McCartney and milked it beyond what it's worth. Interesting only as a footnote in Beatle history. The rest of the book is padding.
1,The pathetic tale of a rejected wanna-be,"That this is a ""commemorative edition"" of a notorious book is pause for wonder. Commemorating what? One of the first rules in journalism is to never write about yourself, because no one cares. The author should have taken that advise. She claims to be Paul McCartney's girlfriend during the tumultuous summer of 1968, but you gain very little, if any, insight into the man or the times. If her claim is at all true, one can only surmise that they spent very little time in conversation. You find out very little about one of the most famous men in the world, but a great deal about the woman he slept with briefly. I found no reason whatsoever for her to have written this book other than the obvious $$$ factor."
1,"SHE""S NO GIULIANO!","Francie may still carry on about her five minute affairwith now old Sir Paul both here in this poorly witten, self serving tome and on the internet but the fact is for tue insight and historical fact on the Beatles one really ought to go to Geoffrey Giuliano's authoritative books. LENNON IN AMERICA especially, is a true gem!"
5,I'm off to read book #3,"SWEET BOUNDLESS picks up where THE ROSE LEGACY left off. With the town of Crystal now free from the evil that had held it captive, Carina DeGratia Shepard takes hold of the house that had once been promised to her. Though Quillian refuses to acknowledge their marriage, Carina refuses to let him go. With grit and determination, Carina creates for herself a small restaurant, bringing her Italian charm to a bustling town. Carina continues to learn more about Quillian's past, a past that has made him the closed-off person that he is. Carina is determined to break down those walls and love Quillian like he deserves to be loved.At times SWEET BOUNDLESS is difficult to read because of the distance between Carina and Quillian. You want so badly for them to be together it's hard to read as they continue to go their separates ways. Knowing THE TENDER VINE will pick up where SWEET BOUNDLESS left off, I'm off to read the final book in series"
4,Got what I paid for.,"First time buyer. Merchandise was as advertised, shipped in a reasonable amount of time. No problems with order. Good company. I would buy from them again.Can't give 5 stars unless I had to deal with customer support, that's when you find how good a company it is."
3,"Wallace & Gromit are back....well, sort of....","I anticipated that this release would be just what it is: a variety type show with wrap-arounds starring W&G.; Fun stuff to be sure, but make no mistake: this is NOT a new set of adventures with our pals.While it's great to have them back, it is a far cry from previous releases.By all means; if you are a huge fan (as we are) pick this up and enjoy - and maybe even learn something. Just don't bring any expectations from previous adventures."
5,"OMG, Some of you have got to be kidding","OK, OK, we too were surprised when we got it out of the library that it was Wallace and Gromit hosting a show about inventors and their inventions, and not a series of Wallace and Gromit shorts with all their crazy inventions.Well the fact is it is so amazing, we are buying it for gifts for young and old alike. You will be stunned by the REAL inventions out there, and the stories behind them. If you have a curious mind, or you want to inspire curiosity in a young one, then this is a movie for you.And as a reminder it just has short cute vignettes of Wallace and Gromit, but the real stars are the REAL inventions."
2,Not exactly what I expected..,I wish that I would have researched this product before pre-ordering but the Wallace and Gromit name made me think that I was getting that! It's not that they aren't in the video but this is really a kids educational series with some W&G; interstitials. Very disappointing to me and I would imagine that the replay value wouldn't even be that great for almost any kid!There was little here for me and nothing for my 16 year old son.
4,Not what I expected...,"I think I should have looked in to this DVD more. It is a show and tell the commentary by Wallace and Gromit. While others do the Show. Very disappointed, I had expected Wallace and Gromit to to all. I am a fan!"
1,Wallace & Gromit Go PC,"We have enjoyed all of the Wallace & Gromit DVDs to date, with that said we did not hesitate to order ""A world of Adventure"". We were disappointed to learn that Wallace and Gromit only conduct introductions and comment on various politically correct story lines dealing with history, science etc. Regardless of ones political views, it would be nice to be entertained and not spoon fed someone else's propaganda. Seriously, the creators of W & G should stick to that which made them wildly successful and forget the PC."
1,not worth buying,"Love all the other movies this one is so bad and unlike the others, we did not even get through half...too bad"
2,Not what I thought,This is a DVD all about the inventions of Wallace and Gromit. Not a video for kids as we had hoped.
3,Not what I expected,"I should have read the fine print. I thought this was a new wallace and gromit claymation comedy. It's actually information videos. Very interesting for adults or older kids. My husband enjoyed it, but it didn't hold the attention of my kids aged 2-9."
2,Didn't enjoy this one,"We looked at it and really didn't enjoy it. It might be great for someone, but the audience we had were younger children between 7 and 10."
4,"Started out slow, but we ended up liking it quite a bit.","When I ordered it, I thought it was the latest in the series of excellent Wallace & Gromit adventures, but they are ""hosting"" a TV show, similar to a PBS science special, and the grand kids and I ended up liking it a lot."
5,Great Video,Here I am at 44 years old and my 3 and 6 year old got this video. I am hooked on Wallace and Gromit. What a great couple guys doing some funny stuff. Good movie and hope they come out with more. Great buy for the money.
2,very little flavor,"it will work as a side if you add something to it, i used broccoli as the product is terribly bland"
3,More of a Juvenile Delinquent film than a Rock and Roll Film,"High School Confidential has misleading advertisements. When I saw the film, I thought it was going to be a semi-rock and roll film co-starring Jerry Lee Lewis (his name is actually in the credits). However, he only comes out during the opening credits singing one song.The story is actually more in line with the 1950s juvenile delinquent films than the rock and roll films. I'm not saying that this is a bad thing because the film actually has a better plot than most rock and roll films. It just appears to be advertised as a rock and roll film.That said, the film has a great storyline, but is overshadowed by beatnik talk and mentality (are beatniks really tough while reciting poetry?). It's great nonetheless."
4,Good old days...school days,Good movie to share for historical perspective. Demonstrates that the times have not really changed much for teenagers. Drugs were available in high schools even in the 50's. Teen-agers who were victims of predatory adults had problems in developing appropriate social relationships. Very good movie to study with a group of educators or adults.
1,Sorry But it did not last a Day,"I took a ride from Carlsbad NM to Elephante butte NM approx. 500 miles. round trip and the first day I passed a small bump it broke, the material is just not good, I would not buy this."
2,No parts with it!,"I received the product in time, but it did not come with any metal ""peg"" to set the length of the transom saver. I have to line up the holes and use a screw, which I am waiting to fall out and then I'll lose my transom saver."
5,Revelatory perfornces of great music,"Until I heard this disc I was perfectly happy with the Kodaly recording of the two opus 77 quartets, but the playing on this recording is revelatory. The phrasing, the management of dynamics, the beautiful sounds of the instruments and, above all, the way the four musicians listen to each each are absolutely 5 star. This has become my favorite Haydn quartet recording and my favorite L'Archibudelli recording. Quartet lovers should write to SONY and ask for more L'Archibudelli recordings of Haydn quartets and of Mozart's quartets #14-#19 dedicated to Haydn."
5,Essential listening.,"IMHO this is historic: the finest record of any string quartets by anybody ever made. Stretch? Listen to how the phrases dovetail tonally from part to part, how the figures flow so easily on gut strings, the glorious viola sound, utterly unlike the dull modern sound, the relaxed energy and effortless blend of identities of it all. This is truly a best guess as to what pre-industrial classical quartets really sounded like. Check out Immerseel's Anima Eterna group doing Schubert for the closest orchestral comparison."
5,Memorable Performances of Classic Haydn,This sublime recording of Franz Joseph Haydn's final string quartets has grown in stature since its 1997 release. L'Archibudelli does the master proud with their brilliant interpretations - highlighted by a beautifully rendered Op. 103. The hour-long disc belongs in everyone's classical music library.
3,say what?,"I haven't purchased this cd or listened to it. I'm commenting on the track listing here on Amazon. Who provides these track listings?The Dead Kennedys had a song called ""Holdiay in China""?Why do so many of those songs in the track listing not even mention the artist who performed the song?I was interested in this set when I first heard the title, but this very shoddy track listing has scared me away from making a purchase."
5,FANTASTIC,"This box is fantastic, amazing 80's songs!!! An interesting compilation of a lot of groups from the manignif era!!! Enjoy, probable you never will see these bands together in a box again!!! amazing!!!"
5,Excellent compilation but I would've chosen different songs,"First off, this is a really excellent collection of music BUT I would've substituted some artists for others. One glaring example was the band The Passions; though the song featured is excellent, I would've dropped it in favor of another artist or band not represented by this collection like The Mission or They Might Be Giants, for example.I was quite pleased to see bands that are normally excluded from ""alternative"" compilations like Minor Threat and Bad Brains. I do feel that both the gothic and industrial subgenres were underrepresented but at least Sisters of Mercy and Ministry are on this collection but I would've liked to see Skinny Puppy featured as well."
3,A little less than expected,"There are two things which would improve this collection. One would be the exclusion of some of the ""novelty"" songs and ""one-hit wonders"". Less is sometimes more. The second would be some sort of cohesiveness in the ordering of the tracks. The music would be better served if similar bands were on the same disc."
5,I Forgot How Cool The Eighties Were,"It's easy to look back and laugh about how lame the Eighties were. This collection reminds you that there were some cool aspects of the decade too. Even though most of the tracks recieved limited airplay on commercial radio, they had a huge impact on the generations of artists that followed. Thanks again Rhino for another awesome collection!"
4,Great coffee table book; good for new Harley fans.,"Good ""starter"" book for historical overview of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and the pictures are excellent. Anecdotal inserts are interesting. It explains the Sturgis for the uninitiated. As a new ""Harley chick"", I have given several as gifts to the Harley buddies who are introducing me to this new world and they have all enjoyed it."
4,"Not definitive, but a good coffee table book","The text covers the early years fairly well, and minces no words when it comes to the bad years of the late sixties-early seventies. Contains some interesting comments by noted figures not only in H-D history, but the general motorcycle community as well. All illustrated, of course, with plenty of photos, some very good indeed. Goes on a bit much about the Sturgis gathering, though, and unfortunately cuts off in late 1993, so no coverage of recent developments such as the H-D partnership with Buell, the onslaught of Japanese imitations and American-built copies, etc. All in all, not a bad addition to the enthusiast's shelf and reasonable value for the money."
2,"Less Rost, more Machado","The best thing on this CD is Aquiles Machado - beautiful voice, good musicianship. Too little of him, alas.As for Rost, screechy and capricious."
2,Popular Guitar Music,"The guitarist was good but I did not really find any pieces that would stand out as ""great"" and ""nice"" that would make me want to hear it over and over again."
1,"Worst product design, ever","The instructions on the back of the container say it all:To open: Loosen screw and turn base to reveal area.To close: Turn plastic base back in position and tighten screw.Sooo, let me get this straight. I need a screwdriver to get my key out? If I could get into my garage for a screwdriver, I wouldn't need a hide-a-key rock. Yes, it's possible to get into the access panel on the back without a screwdriver but it does loosen the contact with the rock itself and your key could fall out next time. Very bad product design. Made in China! ; )"
2,Not impressed,"Not impressed with the quality of this key rock. Bottom is loosely attached, and the key may fall out. The top ""rock"" part bears only a loose resemblance to a rock. At least it was inexpensive."
2,smaller then expected,very small and bottom doesnt fit tightly i had expected it to be a bigger rock but does look like a rock
1,Base plate of both products received were improperly mounted & misaligned,"The black movable base plates were improperly mounted and the guide pegs were misaligned. As such, the rock would not securely close and the base plate could be seen from above by anyone looking down at the ""rock"".Now I have to admit that the SELLER was more than helpful and promptly refunded my money. The SELLER was VERY PROFESSIONAL AND A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH. If I were to be so unfortunate as to receive a defective product in the future, I would hope that would be from this SELLER because I would have nothing to fear. I would already know that things were going to be ""okay"".As a business person, I have purchased many defective products over the years. That is just a fact of life. Defective items sometimes slip past quality control. It happens. Get over it, accept it, and deal with it. This SELLER made ""dealing with it"" A LOT EASIER!!!"
2,key holder,Very cheap. The color was much darker than it looked on line and I purchased it just because it looked lighter than the other holders. Also the back won't stay on.
3,Key rock,"It is a great idea to hide a key as it really looks like a rock that would be in your garden. Only problem with the rock it is very small, it should be a bit bigger, and it opens very easy. But it is functional."
3,Straight-forward and honest,"Ms. Dennis' poetry is straight-forward, sincere and honest. She relates incidents that test her faith daily. We can all associate ourselves at one time or another with these feelings of doubt, joy and faith. Erline is honest with her doubts, but she perseveres knowing that she will find strength through her trust and belief in God."
4,Full of inspiration and warmth,"If you're looking for inspiration and warmth, than you do not want to miss this book of poetry.Everyone who has a child will love ""My child's life is destined to be"". We all can relate to the verse ""Time shall pass slowly at first,Then you appear as a brilliant burst"" My personal favorite is ""I'm searching for you,Lord"" I feel that the author was able to put in words, what is in my heart."
3,Super Reader,"It takes the Phantom a while to uncover this crime, as it is a complex plot involving a crimelord, the doing away of some scientists, and some other trying to get the site of a new government plan moved.They want to do this because a group of men have made a discovery of a pitchblende deposit, enabling the production of radium. This would, of course make them a lot of money.Some clues from one of the dead men at the start finally lead the Phantom to the truth."
1,Very disappointed,"Not only did my screen protector come with visible scratches, it was also came loaded with dust. I followed the instructions to wash the screen, but that didn't solve the problem. Also, the included ""lint"" free wipe only adds dust with each wipe. Maybe I received a bad screen. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with this product."
5,more fun and wit,More fun reading from the creative mind of Skylar Stone. Clever and interesting as Bruce struggles with love and duty. You will have to read the book to see who wins!
5,"Absolutely disturbing, absolutely magnificent","Erl king is the story of Abel, an ogre by definition, a man who likes young boys, flesh and blood. In a book cast with dreams of allegories, eating becomes devouring and shadows turn into evil spirits tyring to steal young souls away. Narrated by a crippled mind, ""Erl king"" takes place in WW2 France and Germany, where the frenzy of a lost soul is agonized by the fury of a generation, sacrificing their sons for a lost ideal, taking away Ogre's only meal..."
3,good but not perfect,"The Krups 4-slice toaster looks nice, and we had high hopes for it. But two of the slots only toast one side of the bread, and 3 out of 4 slots don't toast evenly, making stripes on the bread. And if this is a fast toasting item, I guess my expectations are way too high. It takes a long time to toast even at a medium setting. It does toast bagels nicely, though. I guess you have to go really high-price to get a toaster that will toast perfectly."
2,Good For A While But Wouldn't Buy It Again,"We purchased this toaster in Jan 2006. While it is a handsome device and worked fairly well for about two years (occasional bouts of uneven toasting), one day it stopped working altogether. The toast wouldn't stay down and nothing we could do including a thorough cleaning, changed that.I think that a toaster for this price should last much longer than 2 years. Won't buy another of these and suggest that Krups stick to their coffee makers."
2,Very disappointed with Krups customer service,"I purchased this toaster after seeing good reviews of it here and other consumer publications. Within 2 weeks of receiving the toaster, the lever to raise the toast up broke. I called Krups customer service and they were not initially very responsive. They finally agreed to let me bring it to their local service center where I could get a new toaster. When I brought it to the service center, they didn't have any toasters and had to send the broken toaster to Krups and said Krups would send me a new toaster. Two weeks later, I called Krups and the order was messed up and they finally agreed to send the toaster in 7-10 days. After my complaining, they agreed to send it ""rush"" in 3-5 days. The hassle of dealing with Krups customer service has made me vow never to buy a Krups product again."
2,Slow Uneven Toasting,"I purchased this toaster and was initially disappointed to see how large the appliance was. It takes up a lot of room on the countertop and looks like a commercial appliance.Slices of bread come up with very uneven results. The top half of the bread is toasted, the middle and bottom of the bread are not. Despite the fact that muffins are toasted at a toasting level of 7 or 8, the muffins come up hard, but not toasted, a very poor result.The only good option of this appliance is the roll warming on top of the unit but I think the price is extremely high to pay for just a roll warmer."
1,This toaster is poor at its best.,"I previously wrote coments about this toaster when I first received it that were not very flattering. It has been several months and my opinion hasn't changed. It takes forever to toast. Plunk down a slice of bread, feed the cats, take out the garbage, clean off the the counter, brush your teeth and voila toast. Mushy on the inside, not impressive on the outside. The toaster looks really cool. The ability to pop up smaller stuff works great. I am so sorry I bought it. It just doesn't toast well and is without a doubt the slowest toaster I have ever experienced. Look over the alternatives because Krups in my opinion simply falls short in performance."
2,Works very well for a while - limited lifetime,"We bought this toaster after extensive research. When it arrived, it did live up to its excellent billing - even toasting of bagels, waffles, and of course, bread - for about one-and-a-half years. At this time one side (2 slots) went bad and would not stay pushed down. Within a couple of months, the other side could no longer toast a frozen waffle reliably. Is a toaster this expensive only supposed to live for one-and-a-half years?"
2,Terrible Toaster,I must have received a different toaster than the one other people reviewed. This is the most expensive toaster I have ever bought and without a doubt also the worst performing. Can't believe how sloooow it is and then it toasts very unevenly. Any bread other than the basic size won't fit without trimming and I'm not talking about large slices. I'll be returning this item and am disappointed that Amazon will charge me to return such an inferior item.
2,Too big,Just received this toaster and will be returning it. I never turned it on. It is enormous in depth. Too big for my countertop and I am not short of space. Two stars for good looks.
1,"This rating is for Amazon, not Krups","I am very disappointed in Amazon. I paid top dollar for a NEW Krups toaster and got a used one. I could have gotten it cheaper if I had purchased it as used instead of new. It is obvious that it has been used, they didn't even dust the dust off. VERY disappointed. Amazon, you should check the items you ship out. I'm sure this was a return, but it is obvious that they used it a while before they returned it. I'll shop elsewhere from now on."
2,Too big,This toaster is too big. I have limited counter space in my kitchen - and had to return the unit. I did not even plug it in the wall once.
5,a toaster that works,"After reading about this toaster in the Wall Street Journal, I just had to give it a try. I've had several toasters over the years that never really made that perfect piece of toast. This one is truely the cadillac of toasters and I finally get my perfect toast."
3,Krups Toaster,"I actually think my nine-year old Montgomery Ward's toaster that cost about $25 did better than this. It died owing me nothing and, being a foodie, I picked the Krups as a replacement. I expected excellent results for the price and it's only so-so. The toast doesn't brown evenly and it's hard to judge the proper setting without burning some in the process. I like the vents on top to warm rolls, bread or wraps and that feature works pretty good. Currently one slot is malfunctioning and I have to deal with Krups on it."
4,Great appliance,I bought this for the wife and she uses it a lot. The warming tray works nicely and the unit toasts consistently. The lifters are great when toasting items that are small in diameter. You won't see it in an art museum or anything but I think the toaster is pretty attractive on the counter. It is rare that you get away with buying an appliance for your wife as a gift; she was very happy with this purchase I made for her.
2,Krup Toaster-A bummer,"Looks good. Like cord storage. But, Krups, the slots for toast are really not large enough for bread that has any width to it at all. They would be perfect for square sandwich bread but most people do not use that for toasting. And, I'm not talking about Rye or Pumpernickel......just a regular type of bread (Earthgrains wheatberry). I have to slowly ease down on the toast lever while squishing the bread into the slots.For the price, there is inconsistency in browning of the bread. Sometimes it comes out too light (I have it on max setting) and sometimnes it tends to burn.For the guy who thinks I might have it set on ""bagel""......forget it. I know how to operate the machine. Next time, I will go back to my big box store for a $30-40 toaster."
1,Slowest Toaster Ever!,"This toaster is so slow that I can put in my toast, perform my morning chores and come back just in time for my toast to pop up. I've timed my toast on a medium setting at three minutes, which is absurd. Even worse, since it's being toasted for so long, it comes out dry. We were at a four-star hotel recently and our breakfast order was taking unusualy long. When we inquired about our order, the waitress complained that they had an extremely slow toaster. I asked, ""Is it a Krups?"" Sure enough, they also had this toaster but, fortunately, were ordering a different brand."
2,"Works a few years, then doesnt","The toaster is great, but...BUT the flaw is that the weakest point is the lift for the toast. It broke the first time under warranty. We drove it 40 min.away to fix for free, returning to retrieve the same 40 min away. It has broken again. So for a few years, is fine. For the money, not so fine."
2,"Toasts well, breaks easily","Disappointingly, even through light use, this became a 2-slice toaster within just a few months of purchase (Summer 2006). The side that works, however, has served us well for a few years."
4,"So far, so good.... = )","Great Anniversary present for my husband. He loves tools and this is quite the kitchen tool!!!** My old toaster you had to turn the control way up to get brown, this one you turn it a little past the halfway mark.** Longer bread like Healthy choice, sticks up a little bit, ibut it still gets toasted.**Love the lifter for english muffins, no more unplugging and doing whatever means to get the toast out!**Love the top part for heating up buns, etc.Only complaint ~ Which is for all 4-slice toasters is they are much bigger than they used to be, but this toaster is impressive looking!!Looking forward to trying the rest of the features! Enjoy...."
3,"Good toaster, but....","This toaster is good. But a few months after we purchased it, the mechanism that holds the toast down broke on one side. The other side, though, continued to work well."
1,Disappointed,"Not much to like about this toaster. It arrived dented. Slots are not long enough to fit a slice of bread unless it is the old fashioned size. Toasts unevenly, comes out with brown stripes. Big and bulky. If all you toast are bagels and english muffins, it is adequate. Definitely not worth the money. Wish I had purchased the Breville.JudyScottsdale"
1,Don't Buy It.,"This piece of expensive junk burns the top of the toast and leaves the bottom still soft! And it takes it sweet time doing it. What kind of company would release a product like this? It makes you wonder what else is going to be wrong with it.I can't believe that other people are rating this 5 stars! All the reviews on epinions, class this as a terrible waste of money."
5,best toaster,consumer reports rated this as the #1 toaste4r after buying and using is the best toaster i have ever had and does not cost an arm and leg
1,Disappointing purchase,"I purchased this toaster and I'm sending it back. I scoured Consumer Reports and this was in the top three. The unit I received (a four slice model) had a faulty control on the left side. The lever in the slot was supposed to have three settings so that you could put something small in the toaster (like a mini bagel) and it would raise it above the housing so you wouldn't have to dig for it. Unfortunately, this nice feature (great on the right, but not on the left) was faulty. Another feature I was looking for was a cord that was retractable, and although this one is, the directions say NEVER to operate the toaster unless the cord is out fully. Also the unit is HUGE and takes up a lot of counter space. I'm really disappointed after spending about 2 hours on research to find the perfect toaster for my needs and it didn't measure up."
5,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!","We have had this toaster for over a year now and I am so in love with it. Even my 3 year old can work it. It has great features including a bagel setting so it only toast the inside of your bagel and not the bottom. The slots are nice and wide which are great for leftover frozen belgian waffles. Which comes to another get feature the defrost button. Love it!!! Another great feature, when or item is down you can turn the lever to the right and it will pop your item up farther so you don't ever have to reach into the toaster. The top of the toaster also serves as a warming tray which I love if I just want to warm up some bread a bit. It is very easy to clean, the bottom of both sides of the toaster have trays that pull out and you can wash. The warmer on the top of the toaster also comes off if you want to clean it!LOVE THIS TOASTER, BEST TOASTER EVER MADE!"
5,Comprehensive coverage on SAP Workflow,This book is ideal for both new and experienced workflow consultants. It covers not only those topics you need to know to build up your expertise in workflow but also tips and tricks for the experienced workflow developers. Relevant practical business examples are also included.I'm very pleased that I've made the right decision to purchase this exceptional book!
2,Very disappointing,"I am a workflow consultant with few implementations . After buying this book expected practical examples and tricks , but were very disappointed with just general overview , no depth at all , maybe good for somebody who wants to know in general about workflow , useless for hands on."
3,Sharpen your workflow skills,"This book is very detailed, and is a good offline reference, however with 16 years SAP experience I felt the book laboured theory and lacked examples. SAP workflow is an area in which I have seen many a seasoned sapper struggle and remains to date under utilised in even the broadest implementations. After reading once I do not expect to use this book as a reference as the content is available trawling SAP help."
4,really a good book you will be happy to buy ..I'm not the author...,This book gives a really great help in understanding the architecture of Sap Workflow and its development.In addition it really helped me on the field whe I was to fix a difficult technical problem on a workflow implemented by other people giving to me all the escalation steps to find what it was wrong in that case.
2,Not as good as expected.Lack practical implementation proj,"This is one book from SAP which gives more of theoritical inputs like SAP documentation & less of practical knowlegde.I had expected a few industry examples of workflow projects .Not single practical scenarios simulated in work .To begin a workflow with scratch.It would good for person who already know worklow , just needs to fine tune his skills with workflow.Worth all the money if you need to fine tune workflow skills"
2,Hurts my head.,"I have short hair and this brush has firm hard rubber bristles which cause pain.This may work for long hair but for me, it was worse than my old cheap plastic one.Another issue is that it does not have a finger ring like others I have used, rather it has a protrusion to hold between your fingers. The ring works better for holding in soapy conditions."
4,scalp brush,"My husband likes the rubber scalp brush, he just wishes it had a finger hole instead of the post in the middle."
1,Expectations Were Not Met,"This shampoo brush works no better than the flimsy plastic ones that can be had at Walgreens. The rubber is not particularly supple. The ""bristles"" are not radiused on the end; they have somewhat sharp edges, making the brush rather painful to use. There is no ring on the back to put a finger through. Instead, there is a short rubber stud that goes between the fingers. This feature makes holding on to the brush unnecessarily difficult."
3,Flinn Scap Brush,I use this type of brush while shampooing to clean down to my scalp. This might be great for massage but didn't work too well for my purpose.
5,If you love a good head scratch,Does a much better job than fingertips can as it spins between my fingers to really clean my scalp during shampooing.
2,too hard for me,"I like the design, but found the consistency of it was too hard for my scalp. Also, the tips weren't rounded. Seems like it might be good for a dog."
3,"Better than some, not as good against others","Brush is ok. Brush has short, hard rubber fingers more like that for pet care than human use. I did not like it and returned it."
3,"Good for some folks, not for me.","For me the performance is not to my liking. I much prefer the plastic brushes because for one thing, most of them have finger rings or ""wings"" on the handle making it easy to hold on to while in use. This one only has a rounded peg type handle centered on it's top making it very difficult to hold onto with soapy hands, and the brush material is much to stiff not nearly as flexible as I had desired.I tried it based on some other high rated reviews. I got hooked on shampoo brushes while in the Marines many years ago.Can't give it more than 3 stars for the above mentioned reasons."
5,"great deal, decent glasses","i just wanted something to wear on a week long camping trip, and these really surprised me. they are not the same quality as my raybans, etc but for the money they really feel great.polarized lenses are pretty good; frames are a bit light.UPDATE: After almost 2 years I now wear these weekly. They have held up superbly. I take care of them, and the lenses have not scratched at all.Very happy with these glasses."
1,cheap glasess,"seem they are made from plastic and the quality is really bad, the image is deflected and there's a strange reflex on computer screens."
3,Misleading for Adventures,"I thought it was going to have more ""adventures""! It is ok! My boys lose interest quickly with this dvd."
5,Wonderful,"Although I love all the songs on this CD, Bring It To Jesus Is My Favorite. It's a true statement of how we feel sometimes as Christians and gives insight as to how to handle these situations. You go girl!"
5,Subtle elegance for Berlioz,"Susan Graham is a singer's singer. The more that one listens to this disc, the more this singer's introspection reaches the listener. This disc has much of the same haunting quality that Dame Janet Baker's older recording of Les Nuits D'ete has. Ms. Graham singing of the Berlioz arias is truly stunning at times. This singer is to be much admired. This listener hopes to hear more of her on future recordings."
3,stunning emotion,"In this performance of les nuits d'été Susan Graham brings across the emotional charge of the cycle perfectly. Her voice is wonderfully suited for both the lightness required for ""Villanelle"" and the drama in ""Sur les lagunes"". My not complete enthousiasm lies in the fact that the emphasis in the mixing is too much on the voice, and Berlioz' wonderful orchestration is shoved to the background, diminishing the superb interaction that can exist in these songs."
3,"Fun, but exceptionally shallow.","Janet and Allan Ahlberg, It Was a Dark and Stormy Night (Viking, 1993)Somewhat wordy for a preschool-set book, but an amusing story nonetheless; a kidnapped boy escapes from a band of pirates by telling them a scary story. As the story progresses, the pirates modify it and add to it, thus contributing to their own fates. I'd think this one would probably go over better in a classroom than a home setting, but it's certainly worth checking out and seeing how the kids react. ***"
4,Fantastic for the Price,A friend and I backpacked through Europe last summer and slept in this tent around 12 nights out of a month long trip. We were thrilled with the quality of this tent for the price. It did leak a little when we encountered driving rain and high winds but never on other rainy nights without the wind. We really abused this tent and it held up beautifully. It's a little bit complicated to set up as there are lots and lots of stakes to drive in but overall it's a great little tent.
4,A great tent with a small flaw..,"I'm a begineer using tents and outdoors gear and this is a pretty good first step for a newcomer like me. The tent is quite confortable for a big guy (I'm a 6feet plus guy) it was really easy to install, but the printed instructions were the only setback of the whole experience they were kind of incomplete I had to figure out how to finish setting up the tent all by myself. I was really easy to take down and it fitted perfectly back in the carrying bag. For the price it's a great buy, but please make the instructions a little bit more precise for non-experienced user like myself."
2,Not good for poor weather conditions,"We planned on taking this tent on a long camping trip to Canada this summer. In anticipation of the trip, we took it out for a ""test run"" to make sure it was comfortable and weather resistant. The first night was great. It was a warm night, and the tent provided great ventilation. The second night we had a thunderstorm, and the tent started leaking within minutes after the storm started. The rain shield did, basically, nothing to keep the rain out. Luckily, the rain did not last long, so we were able to dry everything and remain in the tent for the night. If the rain had continued throughout the night, however, we would have been completely soaked. Although the tent is a good price, DO NOT use this tent unless you're absolutely certain that you'll be camping in dry, rain-free, conditions."
5,One of the best!,"Ray Stedman is a fantastic pastor / teacher and this is one of his best. This book can change your life, it did mine.Deo Volente,George"
2,"Cute, but still slippery","These treads are very cute, but they still slip around the tub. I purchased them to help with my slippery tub and they just slide around. I just stuck them to the tub wall for decor."
5,Best Ever!!!,I thought the music was just wonderful on the CD. I think the tribute bands were really top notch on it. I strongly recommend this CD to any one who loves Brian Wilson's music and any of the tribute bands out there trying to do his music justice.Joe
4,Great first dot-to-dot book,I purchased this book for my three year old and she loves it. We are working on what the numbers beyond 12 look like and this book gradually works up to 20. The pictures are very simple and she enjoys coloring them after completing the dot-to-dot. I would definitely recommend this book as a way of introducing your toddler to the world of dot-to-dots.
4,It's more imperfect than perfect.,"I heard about JD NATASHA a few while ago when her first single ""LAGRIMAS"" was being played on the radio. I bought the cd IMPERFECTA/IMPERFECT and I was totally in love with it. From start to finish. Then I found out she would be re-releasing it again with a new name ""Imperfect/Imperfecta"" and a new cover and a bonus dvd and so I thought that it would probably bring bonus songs but no to my surprise I find out that ""TANTO"" and ""HEY YA!"" have been taken out! I love her music but I think that the price is so not worth it since 2 songs are missing. The dvd is good, her videos are simple yet intriguing and the photo gallery is the same pictures that the booklet has. Overall she is a great artist at only 16 and writes her own lyrics and kicks ass performing live but the re-release sould've been better. Piscis and Tanto are my favorite songs from this album."
5,Much better than I expected,"For parents with just a short amount of time to devote to reading about infant development, this book is for you! The segments are broken down into well-organized (by age) sections, meaning that you don't have to read it cover-to-cover. This book is so interesting that I even caught my husband reading it several times! I do think the title is misleading, however. This book is not going to turn you into a flashcard parent. It merely explains how infants develop and gives you ideas to encourage the progression. I especially like that it suggests toys that are well-suited to each phase. It helped us sort through the myriad of offerings at our local toy store."
3,Okay...,"Although this book is divided into age ranges, I don't think it does a great job at reassuring parents that every child develops at their own pace. According to the accomplishments for every month, my child, who is developing normally, seems to be lacking many, many skills.The author is from England, so maybe there are some cultural differences, but I was shocked that he would suggest that watching TV or a video together was a great activity for a 10-12 month old! There was also a mention of using a walker. Both of which I believe are discouraged by the American Academy of Pediatrics!The pictures are great and the text is easy to read, but be skeptical about some of the content."
1,BEWARE,Be careful when ordering this CD. You are only getting 18 tracks and they are only in English. Somehow the description is different from the actual product even though the picture on the CD is the same.
3,Very good introduction to the New Age movement,"This book was released back in 1990 and is somewhat dated, however it still serves as a very good introduction to the New Age Movement.This book will help to unravel the following:(1) Is the New Age compatible with Christian faith?(2) Does it offer full development of each persons potential?(3) Is it simply ancient Eastern religion dressed up in new Western clothes?Overall the book gives the reader insight into a continually growing system of beliefs that include channelling, reincarnation, belief in astral bodies, telepathy, spiritualism etc. If you want to begin to understand New Age thought then this book will definately help."
4,From magnificent to downright awful by same maestro,"Sony has assembled a very strange Mozart CD here with overtures, one symphony and a rarely played divertomento with 4 horns. The divertomento is one of the most underrated works in the entire Mozart catalog. It is absolutely delightful, especially the two movements featuring the four horns. Szell and his great Cleveland Orchestra play this work to absolute perfection. Of course, there is no such thing as absolute perfection in musical performance, but this performance comes extremely close. On the other hand, Szell's performance of the Impressario Overture is plodding and dull, a rare, bad Mozart performance by the great conductor. The rest of the performances are all very fine, making this CD a must for any Mozart lover."
1,ZERO STARS!!!,"What would happen if Nick Cave couldn't carry a tune in a bucket? And what if he were a fundamentalist Christian? And what if he played music by The Hooters? I think it would be a little something like this. I thought from the name that this would be a collection of drinking songs. After listening to it, I could have used a stiff drink or ten. Not to focus on the negative, but the best part of this album is its short length. The songs have monotone melodies, and the vocalists can't even stay on pitch for a measure! At least the instrument is on key. I say instrument, since this is pretty obviously a rather expensive keyboard playing everything. This is quite frankly the worst CD I've ever listened to. Why? Well, aside from the vocal nightmare I've already illustrated above, the lyrics are preachy and trite, and the backing instrumentation is rigidly put together, like listening to a machine. I could go on and on, but I'm trying not to be spiteful."
4,Inexpensive fun,"We were skeptical about this being any good, since it was only about 6 bucks. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with it. What a great toy! My 3 1/2 year old loves loves loves it. My only suggestion would be to have the alien guys glued on to their holders because when he uses them they tip over easily and it's annoying.But what a great buy for the money!"
4,"Bidu Sayao at La Bohème, an unique Performance","Wonderful and rare Bidu Sayao voice's register in her hay days. She is the first Brazilian prima donna to bring the Metropolitan under the spell of her talent. His leading man Richard Tucker utilizes sort of mechanically his strong timbre. Saving the voice in the high peak notes he does not reach the drama tone required in well known Arias as ""Che Gelida Manina"". Bidu's best performance would be attained in the 1951 Season in the same Opera House. By her side, Giusepe Di Stefano, though then just a beginner, gives all the vigor of his voice and gets closer to the drama colors of the scenes intended by the author Pucccini"
3,"Nice story, no excitement","I liked the story but it wasn't as good as some of the others I've read by JK Rowlings and Rick Riordan. I felt there were too many characters popping in and out, and that the suspense level could have been better. Some parts seemed to go on and on with no point. Overall, it had potential to become a great story but I'm not drawn to read any more works from this author. Please don't let my opinion stop you from reading this story, Some may like it the way it is, I just wanted more action and better story structure."
3,"Good, But No Harry Potter","I liked the story but did find it a little slow in parts. The concept of a magical portal to another dimension inside a closet was interesting and the creatures on the other side were believable. However, I always felt closed in for some reason while reading, maybe because the action took place in small places, not open areas. I would recommend this book to young readers looking for an interesting and easy read."
2,"Beautiful, but almost useless","I have to say that I'm a little disappointed about this book. Although the images are very beautiful and Kumiko's work is precious, the projects of the gifts are exclusively for the Japanese society. There are many objects from Japanese folklore and they do not make any sense for occidental people."
3,Lost in Translation,"Omiyage is a very good book and I have made several items, however I believe the editors could have done a better job. For example, the Sakura project has 5 petals but the illustration shows 6. Even worse, if anyone can actually construct the pinecone using the directions given, please tell me. There is something horribly wrong with the written directions and the accompanying illustrations. I ended up making it based on the photo of the finished bag."
2,Beautiful items/difficult to reproduce,"This woman is an extremely talented artisan. She grew up in Japan. She started as a child making these beutiful trinkets. This book is for someone with PRE knowledge of Japanese artistry, its terms, and practice on small things throughout her entire life. Its much more complex than what I expected. I sure do wish I had just a fraction of her talent. It was very hard for me to give the book a number to measure its usefullness, or directions its just way out of my league. But for someone who posses this talent I think the book would be treasured."
3,Too Many Pieces,This is veautiful work but it has too many pieces for me. It will take more patience and better dexterity than I have.
5,Omiyage - a must have book,"this is a great little book. the flower ""pockets"" are ieal as gift holders. Handy for craft groups - especially the back section which details how to organise and teach a lesson in this pretty craft. No need for sewing machines, just needle and thread."
2,pretty much horrible,This book has received a lot of good reviews. Everyone has an opinion. My opinion is that it is a horrible book. The presentation is terrible and it really doesn't catch your attention or give you any desire to continue learning. There are many other books that are much better.
4,"Quick, easy, informative with few typos.","I almost never give 5 stars, but this book is close. The program steps provide details without getting boring. A good book to learn VB, but not a good reference book."
5,Great Book for The Beginner,"I Have often been very skeptical of the ""Learn whatever in 21 Days books"". However, this book is perfect for the beginner or someone who needs a refresher.The author guides you through all of the concepts in easy ""lesson"" formatting complete with questions and exersises to help you learn. It however, is very broad. Not a whole lot of detail in this book. However, you can easily geting the Advanced VB books after reading this one.I work in VB on and off as projects arrise. I found this book to be great to refresh my memory of relearn concepts I was never quite sure of.Great work."
4,A good foundation to build a programing powerhouse on.,I have been programming in C++ for two years on the college level and found this book to be good at building a foundation knowledge of the language that can be expanded on with other book. I am on day 15 and alread have a good start on a bussiness program.
3,"Covers a lot, but not detailed !","I finished reading this book in about 10 days and I think it doesn't cover many basic and important concepts for beginners. If you don't have any programming experience before, this book may not be suitable for you since it only covers fragment of VB Concepts. We don't just want to be able to use VB 5.0, we want to be able to enhance our programming abilities."
4,Good for Starts...,For a beginner it was a great book to start. The actual programming examples are very helpful. but does not go in great depth of advanced Visual Basic techniques.
3,Great for beginners.,"As someone who has never programmed in VB, I found this book to be an excellent starting point.There's no way this will be the last VB book you will ever buy. I have programmed in Pascal, and so I didn't read every page of the book, which is very much pitched at an introductory level."
1,Awful Police Propaganda,"I have tried hard to find any point in this movie, except for the fact to tell kids that its cool to be a cop. Not the type of movie to rent for your family, if you actually want to get something for the whole family out of the film medium. This is a perfect example of why most family movies in the 90s are no good; no ineteresting storyline, no good kid acting and a dry plot that puts cops on a ledge. If you want good famliy entertainment turn back to the 80s Goonies, Gremlins, ET and The Flight of the Navigator are a perfect place to start."
2,"Great photos, silly text","This looked very tasty and the photos are indeed quite lovely. Unfortunately, there is not an original idea in this entire book. The author sets herself up as the next Martha Stewart but she just hasn't got it. Take this excerpt on serving raspberry fool ""Spoon it into small wine glasses or secondhand 1930s ice cream glasses."" Yuck! They HAVE to be secondhand, and 1930s, not '40s. The whole tone of the book is ignorant and twee."
5,Extrememly easy and helpful lessons to develop the skill,I listen to the CD over and over - and because one's mind drifts you always hear something new the next time around. I believe you especially hear what you need to hear. I utilize the guided imagry and mediatation daily. I am really excited about learning to communicate with animals - all of them!
4,Loved it,I enjoyed listening to this CD. I do wish it had more meditations but listening to her explanations has helped me thru my time of grief. I have been picking up all kinds of information and this was helpful to a starting process. It was worth the money.
2,Outdated,Book is outdated as areas noted therein are not as promising or even available as they once were. Some areas listed are now on park or monument property and therefore collecting is prohibited there. I would consider the book to have historical value. If you would base your entire rockhounding trip on this book you will be disappointed. Gem Trails of Utah though not perfect is a better choice of the books available. This book needs to be updated to reflect current conditions.
3,Finding rocks,This book is helpful in finding locations where one can look for minerals.I would have liked a few more photos of the type of minerals to be found.The maps and directions are good for someone who knows which minerals theywant to pursue.
1,NEVER GOT BOOK AND THEY GOT MY MONEY!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, THEY TOOK MY MONEY BUT I NEVER GOT THE BOOK. TOTAL RIPOFF SITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WATCH OUT!!!!! DON'T LET THEM TAKE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!"
1,Damaged Goods,Lamp was received in a box that was pushed in. The product seems to have been opened once before. The bulb was broken and the base was dented. Calls to Tensor customer service were not answered and eventually cut off. Instead of the hassle of returning the product I've decided to be more careful in the future what I order online. The replaced bulb cost 7 dollars before I could even use the lamp.
2,You get what you paid for,"Thought this was a good deal until I used it a couple of times. The light bulb has gone out already only after two usage. Plus, the cap you have to remove to get to the bulb to replace it is very hard to open. I would not recommend this to anyone. Flash light works just as good if you have someone to hold it for you."
2,Concur with shipping problem,"The lamp itself certainly seems sturdy enough, but I also had a problem with shipping damage -- in my case, a broken bulb. When this many persons have similar problems, it probably isn't just chance. So, given this design flaw, I must recommend against purchasing this lamp unless you're willing to roll the dice and possibly go through the process of obtaining replacements."
3,Broken bulb but we still like it,"As many others have mentioned, expect the lightbulb to be broken upon arrival. This happened to us to, but when I saw that so many other people had experienced problems getting the lightbulb problem rectified I decided I was too busy to deal with the headaches. We bought a replacement bulb at Lowe's which cost a few dollars, but at least now the lamp works.It has a really nice look to it, has handy hooks for grill equipment, and we love being able to see what cooking at night!"
3,Good for $14.95 not 19.95...,"The lamp bulb arrived broken but the lamp seems work fine since the bulb was just cracked...I was going to buy another lamp but now it's $19.95, 25% more, don't seem as the deal is good anymore????even though the lamp in appearance looks nice."
2,finish does not hold up outdoors,"Lighting is good, but the finish became pitted in the first year it was outdoors, both on the base and the light fixture. Very disappointed."
5,light ups great,We ordered this lamp despite the negative reviews and found that we were very pleased !
3,"Good Lighting, but One Problem","This light throws a good beam on the BBQ, so we can see when the hamburgers are done. It's handy for hanging the tools on the hooks too.The problem we've had, is the silver colored lamp shade has become pitted and lumpy looking. The base also is showing rust spots. This is really disappointing, as it was advertised for outdoor use. It even has a stake for securing it in the yard, but we use it on our screened patio."
4,Great light for $20,"Light has performed very well, esp. for sale price of $19.99. But when it arrived, the bulb was broken--fortunately I already had another specialty bulb, so be prepared to shell out at least $6-8 for another 50watt GU-10 bulb. Even so, we LOVE the light; it really illuminates the grill well."
4,"Pricey, but valuable.","OK, I'll admit it; $30 (the price as I'm writing) seems a bit much for a simple footswitch. Still, I decided to purchase this branded product (vs. a generic substitute) because noise-free switching is critical for punch-in recording. Happily, this unit delivers. I'm now hopping in and out of vocal tracks on my Portastudio 414mkII without a sound. And given the quality of some of my tracks, that's a very good thing..."
4,Excellent narration and nice and slow filming highlight the 3-day Kailash Kora,"Filmed in 2002, this video from FlyingMonk Films starts off with the drive to Kailash, passing Saga, Zhongba and Paryang. The three-day Kailash kora is shown in detail, describing each of the major highlights like Darchen, Tarboche Pole, Chuku Gompa, Dirapuk, and the 5630 Dolma La, The images of Kailash are superb, including the south, west, and north faces. After Kailash they explore Lake Manasarovar. The introduction to the video has scenes from the major monasteries in Tibet - Sakya, Tashilhunpo in Shigatse, Gyantse's Kumbum and Pelkor Chode Monastery, and the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa.The filming is very good, nice and slow, perfectly illustrating the vastness of the Tibetan plateau. The narration is well done, describing the sights very well. The descriptions of Buddhism and its symbols like prayer flags, prostration, statues and paintings are expertly explained."
4,Nice format of pieced block designs,"Buy this book if you enjoy collecting quilt block patterns, and would like to see some fresh updates on traditional ideas. There's also an interesting section on pieced border designs. If you're comfortable about calculating yardage, and cutting & piecing quilt blocks on your own, this book is fine. But if you're a beginner, or if you prefer to have more detailed assembly instructions, then pass this one up because you won't find it here."
1,Not really worth the space it takes.,What a waste. This was one of the first quilt books I bought and I guess I was looking more for an encyclopedia or how-to for a number of basic blocks. This is NEITHER.I also felt cheated about the number of blocks promised. They've thrown in a lot of very simple applique blocks to get to the 101.I have since gotten Barbra Brackman's Block base program and that is a true encyclopedia. There are many rotary cutting or other technique books that would be so much better than this for actual block or quilt making. This has no cutting or assembly suggestions.
4,This was worth purchasing for new quilting ideas.,The book has 2 different photo color photographs showing an example of the blocks with piecing instructions beneath it. On the next page is a full diagram of the block that can be traced. The book is worth getting because the pictures of the blocks are so pretty & it can give user's new ideas for quilting. This book has so many choices and different combinations that will be useful for putting together new projects. The only bad thing is adding in the 1/4 inch inseam allowance to each piece of the block. The book is for experienced quilters because some of the blocks are applique designs or would require previous experience for sewing them together.
2,Not impressed,"Not as impressed as I thought. This has some very nice examples in it, but no way of knowing how much fabric, how to cut and piece together. Very self explanitory. I was looking for something a bit more definitive for putting the blocks together."
3,Lovely to look at...,"I agree with many of the reviewers - I found it very difficult to work with the patterns (tracing, no seam allowances, no light/dark suggestions) and the instructions were a tad confusing. I haven't put together any quilts from this book. However, it's a great book to look at and dream."
2,The book has good ideas but was complicated to translate.,I took this book out from the library and enjoyed reading it. The directions are hard for me to translate to sewing as they are overwhelming. I am an experienced quilter but I would not use this book for rotary cut quilts or traditional piecing. I would however use it for foundation piecing. I found that the pictures of most of the blocks were a good base for foundation piecing . I like the spriral base of the binding as it does lie flat. I am considering adding this book to my library for foundation piecing but not traditional or rotary cut quilts.
1,don't do it!,"add stated a set of 6 clamps for $54 good deal right? i received 1. one clamp for $54??? i got a set on e-bay cheaper, so don't be fooled"
5,The best singer you've never heard of,"Eva Cassidy has no equal vocally; it is as simple as that. On this CD she sings songs from a variety of genres, and excels effortlessly in all of them. ""Waly Waly"" is utterly haunting and otherworldly, and ""How Can I Keep From Singing"" is full-bore rousing gospel that proves that her vocal range and power was all but unlimited. She also sings blues, jazz, and ballads with equal perfection. Eva, God bless you, I'm sure you are front and centre in the heavenly choir with such a voice as yours. There is no-one better."
5,A voice from heaven...,"A friend recommended that buy Eva's CDs. It was the best advise I've received in years. Listening to Eva's voice was like hearing a voice from heaven. Her music helped me through my grandfather's death from cancer. Her voice and songwriting were unbelievably touching, bringing a sense of peace during troubling times."
5,What a wonderful disc and a beautiful voice,"This disc as well as Eva Cassidy's other two available on Amazon, nearly bring me to tears every time I listen to them. It is so sad that she is no longer with us. But we are lucky to have these discs to enjoy. And I just discovered a 4th album...a collaboration with Chuck Brown. The disc is called ""The Other Side"" and is available from Tower Records. I highly recommend this disc as well."
5,Eva By Heart,I have just discovered this artists' absolutely incredible voice and cannot quit listening over and over to this beautiful CD. Her voice just...angelically floats like wisps of breaths ever so gently carrying you along with her. The first time I heard Waly Waly I could hardly breath I was so moved.Listening to that voice ever so gently floating among the clouds is an experience you don't want to miss. She sings with such feeling and passion. I am going to buy her other two CD's as soon as I can get to the music store ! I feel like I know her and I miss her. How I wish she could have given us more of herself.
5,One of her three best,"For me, her best are this one (Eva By Heart), Time After Time and American Tune. The best two here are Songbird and Wade. Then Time, Stranger, Blues and Waly. When I hear Songbird and her voice comes in at the beginning, it brings me back to the first time I heard it, heard that voice. (It was on the Love Actually soundtrack CD.) The world stops spinning when she sings."
5,Eva By Heart,Eva Cassidy has done it again..What a beautiful voice..I can listen to her all day long...I recommend to every one go out and get all of her cd's you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!
5,"Too little, too late",I just found the initial record and bought it because it was a local musician who played at Blues Alley near my home. What a shock to hear a voice that could do anything. Everything said by the other reviewers is true and correct. I don't know what fame she sought or would have found but she has left an enduring mark on me.
4,Spitfire Grill - wonderful music score,"James Horner is certainly one of the top five film composers in Hollywood and has produced some of the outstanding scores of the past two decades. Almost always original, his scores are the product of artistic technique and brilliant originality. Spitfire Grill is simply beautiful - reminding us often of Bernstein's ""Mockingbird"" with it's magical piano and flute cues and lovely string textures. Solo instruments frequently shine above the entire orchestra in haunting melodic figures and major thematic material underscores the most moving dramatic scenes. This is truly one of Horner's best film scores."
1,Spitfire Grill,"This was basically a movie soundtrack, not the lyrical music from the musical. I was disappointed."
4,Okay product,"I bought the front and back struts for my car. I replaced both of the front struts only to find out that ones of them was defective. One was made in the USA and one was made in Japan. The one made in the USA was the bad one. I had to take the bad one to KOI to get it swapped out. I still have not put the new one on because I hate dealing with compressing the springs. It makes me nervous because it is dangerous. I have been doing a lot of maintenance on my car. I am almost to 200,000 miles on my 2003 Accord so I need to put the other 3 struts on."
5,I loved this book!,"This is such a wonderful book! I stumbled upon it at the bookstore and thought it had just the perfect concept. Food and travel--what else do you need? The selections here are amazing, and each piece really delivers. This is a must-have for any lover of food and adventure. Remember it the next time you need that special and unique gift for someone."
5,The Kramer,The Kramer arrived in good time. It was in excellent shape. I mounted it and it is now on my wall. looking good.
3,nice poster,the poster was nice and looked great! but idk if it was the damn ups guy or the company when they were bringing it to ups but my poster got crinkled like crazy! you can really tell when there is a bright light in the room but if you see it from certain angles it okay..
3,"Great poster, arrived with a bent crease in it","I love this poster, the packaging however got bent in route to me and caused a crease in the middle of the poster. I steamed it and it seemed to take care of the crease, in the more visable area, but still is a problem. Doesn't matter though, the poster still hangs on my wall and makes me laugh everytime I see it. Gotta love Seinfield! Gotta love Kramer!me"
5,Kramer Poster,"Very pleased. Fast delivery. Packaged very well. Product was perfect, couldn't be happier."
2,"If this was Jamie Pittle, I'd buy it.","Look, this poster is pretty cool, but if it were a poster of Jamie Pittle it would be even better. Just saying..."
1,Waiting waiting waiting,I Would like to review this item but it hasn't been delivered! Was told it would arrive around the 17th Sept now 8th October.............
5,Love it,"I am big fan of the show so i liked it very much, it came in nicely nothing wrong with it and got it quickly,"
1,Never received,"Ordered because it was on sale for a great price and my husband had requested it once to add to his poster collection in his hangout in the barn========never received. Had our postman look through our small area post office===just in case, but not here. I paid more postage/handling on it than I did for the poster, but it is the idea that it just vanished that is aggravating. Have ordered a few other posters that came from this company in the past and no problem."
4,"Awesome, shipping a little messed up","it is an amazing poster and brings a smile to my face every time i see it. The poster came rolled in thin cardboard paper and in a triangular prism type box. i live in an apartment complex and they tried to deliver it to me but i guess they couldn't so they left it at my local post office and then the post office tried but couldn't so they left a note that i had to go pick it up, it wasn't a hassle to go but usually ups has always been able to deliver to me but this time FedEx tried to deliver but couldn't."
4,keeps you interested,"I liked Border Dogs, I like the caracters. Ralph Cotton keeps things moving. He holds my interest.I would recommend this book."
5,Beautiful Book!,"When I received this book, a gift for my 17 year old son, I was taken aback at the size and beauty of the book. My son is a big fan of not only guitars and the band Pink Floyd, but also art and photography and the author, Peter Thorgerson. This book has many really neat photos in it from the album covers of Pink Floyd. The color is very vibrant and surreal images make the book well worth the money. Amazon shipped this book with plenty of time to spare before Christmas and it will be a very lovely surprise for my son under the tree Christmas morning. I can't wait for him to see it. Highly recommended for anyone who has an appreciation for art, music, photography or Pink Floyd. I think this will be a book he cherishes and browses for years to come...One of the best gifts I ever bought for him and well worth every penny!"
3,It's O.K.,I wish we could preview DVDs such as this sort before we purchase.Purchasing blind is like being in a shoot gallery.
3,Is this book up to date?,"I know it's hard to keep up to date, but that's why new editions are published. What got my attention was the fact that this book's description of getting to Yaxchilan clearly pre-dates the construction of a paved road from Palenque all the way along the Guatemala border to Lagunas de Montebello. The publication date of the book is September 2001, yet the road was opened in 2000 and must have been under construction for some time before then. I hate it when something I know is wrongly described in a book; it makes me mistrust the rest of it."
5,An Excellent Overview,"I think that the reviewers that gave this book lower scores may have had misplaced expectations. While this book gives a reasonable amount of information about each of the sites that it covers, it does not provide an in depth treatise on them. It does, however, provide sufficient detail for a starting point and, more importantly, is invaluable in identifying the major sites and in recommending which sites are potentially more interesting. I found the rankings (in number of trowels) to be particularly useful."
5,"Out-dated now, but still excellent","The book is a little bit out-dated today, as Mexicans continually dig and ""update"" their sites, but it's still very informative regarding the historical and archeological record about each site covered, which I know from the first hand, as I've visited some of them with the book in the hand. The only minus would be not including some also important sites of which I was aware, but which I haven't seen, so I personally wasn't at any loss here."
5,Dickens Village,"I started a collection of these for my mom, it's great to have something that I can add to each year at Christmas that she has wanted for decades. The houses sell for a great price on Amazon and the selection is much better then sifting through what Hallmark may have available when you're looking."
4,Truly a page turner!!!!!,"This book is perfect for anyone that is looking for love, romance, wisdom, and a little suspense. Every woman in this book has either played the roll of one of these characters, or knows someone that has. Charlene surprised me quite frankly, this is the first book I've ever read by her and I am looking forward to reading many more. This book is exceptional."
5,Truly identifiable characters with soul!,"This book touched my heart, mind and spirit in a way I did not anticipate. Ms. Berry truly knows the heart of a woman and the many levels we must hurdle all in the name of love.This book is definitely a God-send. Looking forward to reading more from this surprsing writer."
2,Talk about hokey!,"I have read a lot of romance novels, and I especially like ones with a Western flair. However, this is the corniest one I've read in a long time! I mean, Dusty Dare? Hired hands named Hunky, Ben, and Flint? I'm sorry, but I had a hard time getting past the stereotypes that filled this book. Yes, it was a cute story, if you think all ranches are dude ranches. If you've had any experience with a real ranch, you'll have a hard time liking this book. It doesn't make me excited about reading another of Ms. Roszel's books."
4,A Good Gagaku CD,"Gagaku is a prominently used form of music in my Church. It is also one of my favorite types. The Gagaku is so mystic! The sounds evoke your soul. I like this CD because it is good representation of what Gagaku is. If one were to inspect classical Asian music, Gagaku would be the one to study."
4,Gripping Personal Account,"The book is a unique approach to Holocaust Literature in that it is set as novel, but clearly, is a first-person account of the trials and tribulations that Laura Hillman experienced. The feeling Laura has for her parents, siblings, and husband are clearly evoked by this approach."
5,Good Viewing,It was everything that I wanted to see and all that I expected. Worth buying and worth sharing.
5,One of the best documentaries i own.,This is a must have for any Rory Gallagher fan I would buy this just for the Beat Club Sessions which are amazing. The picture is clear you can see Rory Fingers clearly as he plays the songs. What more could you ask for especially where the footage was made in the 70's also the documentary is great interviews by Rory himself and other major artists also the documentary shows footage of his previous band Taste so this is to me a great buy.
1,Zone Blues,"It never ceases to amaze me that British artists DVDs are available Zone 1 and BluRay Region ""A"" but are not available Zone 2 or Region B - it's like inviting someone to produce bootlegs!! Why do we even have to put up with ""regions"" at all? It's one click to make a disc zone free :-("
1,Not her best work,"This book started off very slow, which made this book very boring.This book doesn't hold a candle to her books Princess and the sequel,if I wouldnt have spilled juice on the book I would have returned it."
2,Not her best of books,"I recently came across this arthur a few months ago, I purchased ever last book on my kindle fire and have continued to be pleased. This by far was at the bottom of my list. I will continue to support her because i like her other books but this didnt do to much for me."
2,Disappointed,"I felt that nothing happened in this novel. I found myself skipping pages just to get to the end. The most exciting event was a community party called the ""Spring Fling"" where the two main characters danced.The heroine's past was not fully developed and only given about three paragraphs on the third to last page of the book.Very boring...I do not recommend."
4,aaa,"I highly recommend the book, ""The ghost behind the wall."" It is a story about a boy who finds a secret passage that leads him from his apartment to others as well. He then starts sneaking into other peoples apartments and takes things from thier house to make them think they're going crazy. He tends to pick on and old man inparticular. But while the boy is climing out of the mans apartment he meets a ghost boy.The boy gets so frightened, he quickly squirms out of the pipes as fast as he can and rushes home. It was a frightening experience but the boy continued to go back. After a while the ghost and the boy become friends. Before you know it they start scaring people together. If you want to find out what happens next in this thriller, I strongly advise you and your friends to read ""The Ghost Behind the Wall."""
3,Good idea but mediocre execution and poor support,"I bought one for emergencies, to have in case of blackout or earthquake. I was hoping the light would be bright enough so I could use it to pass the time by reading. Even at full charge it's not that bright, and after about 2 hours, the light drops off drastically. The radio only picks up the most powerful stations.Don't lose the box!!!!! It features important operating instructions like ""DON'T CHARGE THE BATTERY FOR MORE THAN 5 HOURS"", and ""DON'T WIND THE DYNAMO FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES"" and ""ALWAYS KEEP THE SWITCH AT SOLAR POSITION UNLESS USE THE OTHER TWO POSITIONS."" These things are pretty important because they either drain the battery or wreck it. This is essential operating info. I used a Sharpie to write these instructions on the bottom of the lantern. It's not pretty, but at least I don't have to keep the box handy and I don't have to worry about wrecking the thing because I forgot the instructions."
1,What a ripp offf!!!!,"What a plastic piece of junk.Made in china, it is not anywhere close to water proof, just 2 sides pressed together, I'm afrain if it's dropped it will come apart ina bout a dozen pieces.The light is verrrrry dim, my small penligh is brighter with more throw.The radio is pure static.They don't include anykind of cell phone adaptor, rendering THAT useless, and the ye don't include a 6 volt input to quick charge.The ad is misleading the box is misleading.It's more suitable for my granson, i'm gonna trade him for his hasbro light evenup because the only thing that seem s to work onthis one is the cute flashing red light, and the obnoxious yet useless siren, he'll like that.but for serious use, this is dangerous to rely on.A total ripoff,it's not even worth the 9 $ shipping and I am going to refuse payment."
1,not worth it and did not work,"Do not waste your money on this. In an emergency you want the radio to work, this did not work out of the box. It did not come with an AC charger and it does not charge in 2 days of Hawaiian sun! I would have just bought other batteries BUT the proprietary battery is locked in the case. So even if it worked out of the box, if the battery failed during an emergency you cannot replace the batteries. That does not really sound like a good design for an emergency situation!! Amazon has another one that looked really good for $10 more - we will just wait for it to come back into stock thought. Just search for ""Ambient Weather WR-111A Emergency Solar Hand Crank AM/FM/NOAA Digital Radio, Flashlight, Cell Phone Charger with NOAA Certified Weather Alert & Cables"".I would not have given it even 1 star if that were possible."
2,ER Emergency Ready Solar & Hand ~Cranked Emergency LED,I felt it was very cheaply mfg'd I do NOT recommend this product to anyone. It is more like a cheap toy!.
1,What are you buying this for?,"My wife and I are going to St Maarten and I purchased a couple of Fodor books and this video. The video is not worth the money.If you are concerned about surfing possibly this DVD may be of value. If you are visiting the island and looking for a dvd about local culture so that your travel experience is enhanced then spend your money someplace else. My wife and I kept looking at each other while the video was playing.It does say it's about surfing. It does say it's about music. But it also says Dutch and French Cultures. We waited patiently for it to tell us something interesting about the island and when it seemed to prematurely end without doing so we both looked at each other and starting laughing.There is no ""exploration of Dutch and French Cultures!"""
5,Well Written,This book is a detailed profile of the handful of individuals who shaped the concept of the new CEO. It is very revealing how they struggled to work their way to the top. The author creates a lucid and understandable account of the way of doing business in today's fast paced e-commerce world.
2,"Not deep, not great","It was an ok read. It was not at all deep, and was more or less just research regurgitation about CEOs."
1,I was disappointed in this book.,"The book falls somewhere in between the Idealist and Preterist Approaches to Revelations. It is interesting to read a different viewpoint, but was almost insulting in his views of the Futurist Approach. On page 94 Mr, Metzger discribes beliefs in Postmillennialists, Premillennialists, and Amillennialists which are not to flattering either."
1,Don't buy this book. It's not related to the codes!!!,A typical rendition of the surface text of the Book of Revelation. This book has nothing to do with hidden texts. This is not even a terrific book on revelations.
4,Excellent analysis of the symbolism,"Pair this with Elaine Pagels' ""Revelations"" and you have one complete book discussing the meaning of John's symbolism within the contemporary culture. This is a solid, cogent breakdown of the historical antecedents of the images in John's book, and puts the whole work in perspective that a modern reader can understand.Too often, the Book of Revelation is used to defend indefensible policies or bizarre eschatological fantasies. Metzger's work places the imagery and the story line in context, explaining not only what these images meant to the people of John's time, but where they originated. This is an important book for those who would like to go deeper than the ""Left Behind"" series."
4,Moderation,Good for Sunday School classes for those churches that do not live in Revelation or refuse to touch it. It does not lead you to an end-time prediction behind every action on earth. Metzger gives detailed and historical insight to every chapter.
4,Very good survey of Revelation.,This book is an excellent overview of Revelation. Metzger avoids millennial speculation and points the reader in the right direction on understanding the imagery of the book. It is especially good for those just beginning to study John's Apocalypse.
2,Disappointed,Was not impressed. I was hoping to answer some of my questions regarding Revelations and this book was a little confusing.
2,Um...,"Okay, this story had great pictures and the idea was funny, but on the whole... It wouldn't be worth more than the three bucks I paid for it. THe book is teeny and stapled together, and lacks the irony and twists that Jhonen is famous for. It's a nice one-time read, but not the kind of thing you savor, like Squee, ZIm, or Nny."
3,...and sold.,"We love J.V., yes we do, we'll buy his meat, and filler too!This is a fun little number, a couple bucks for a couple laughs.No more.No less.But no pressure, both creators are clearly talented, so there's no reason not to buy enough of these mini-comics *From SLG* to support a real project when it comes along."
5,Healthy can taste good,"I've tried alot of different healthy cookbooks, and they call for hard to find ingredients, and usually just don't taste that good. This book is different, the recipes I've tried really taste wonderful."
4,It grew on me...,"First I aksed myself ""why did he go with Timbaland?"" Why do a lot of people stick with has-beens? Well it worked out for him. After the BS album ""10,"" I (and other after each album from him) always wonder how he will come on the next one and if he could do it again. When I saw young teenage boys going sick over the song, I knew he had a hit. He was dominating 106 and Park for a while.It took me a while to get into this one as the first joint that I heard from him was ""Feel the Beat."" I was hoping that this would be his first single because that song is the single hottest on the album. That song made me get the album. As usual, L.L. releases what he thinks will be his commercial joint instead of releasing his hottest joint. Remember when ""back Seat"" was a B-side until it blew up? At least he put ""Feel the Beat"" in the video. I wish he would have just made two videos. I give the song 4 because of the L.L. memories and it grew on me. ""Feel the Beat"" would get 5..."
3,Average,"Feel the Beat is cool,but Headsprung is wack to me. LL COOL J has been on Crusie Control for so long it ain't even funny.while He will go down as One of the Greatest Rappers Ever,He also will be remembered for just going through the Motions for many a year as well.this cut is the kind He could do on a Off day.but LL has been putting it down for 20 years&to say that in the Rap Hip-Hop world is a Major statement.but I also miss the days when this Cat was Musically Hungry."
5,I recommend this book/cd,"I am virtually a beginner guitarist (strummed chords as a teenager, playing now 30 years later). I purchased a number of method books and like this one the best. I follow the lessons, listen to the cd and practice. The first 2 cd tracks are simple, nice sounding songs. They are perfect songs to practice hand position and get your fingers moving. I can see myself progressing, getting faster and I'm starting to instinctively put my fingers on the right strings. Just purchased the 2nd book in the series (more because my enthusiasm is high, than I needed it yet).I feel that this book has helped me get to a point where I will keep at it. ...and what more can you ask. So for that reason I have left this review.Good luck."
1,Better alternatives available,"I cannot judge this book as a book on shamanism, but as a business book it is very basic, to me personally, practically useless. As a book on power, it hardly scratches the surface. If you want to understand power, wether in politics, negotiation, business or in personal life, much better options would be two books by Robert L. Dilenschneider ""On Power"" and ""Power and Influence"", ""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene and ""Power Plays"" by Robert Mayer. Hey, it seems that Roberts are the experts on power, or could it be some sort of covert shamanic plot? Hmm...."
2,The Primate Path,"I gather the point of this cliff notes for new age strivers is to draw an analogy between Power Monkey See, Power Monkey Do!The Dr's ""Phd's no less"" That alone should make the working classdrop outs,Fast food asst. manager wannabe's feel as though the are getting advice from ""a Genuine Doctor Person"" Claim you can be more succsessfull by associating with the type of person you wish to be. Pigeon holeing men and women into several archtypes, wizard, wise woman,Prophet,Phd.and promising that they will be whom they wish/dress/associate with . Well case in point i'll give 1 example Oprah raised poor,she did not raise to her status in life trying to be a wasp pretending she REALLY found Monet divine, She was/is Genuine,Honest, no GAMES. If this method is so right? who are (...) I don't even recognize thier names nor the people that sing thier praies on thier book, but I must admit I haven't been in the""Peruvian Amazon Jungle"""
5,Favorite stories,"My 5 year old daughter loves the CobbleStreet Cousins series. We have been reading it over and over and over again since she was about 4. Cynthia Rylant (also writes Henry and Mudge) writes a nice story about three 9 year old cousins who spend a year with their Aunt Lucy while their parents are travelling with the ballet. During the year they do many activities, such as forming a cookie company, writing a newspaper, making doll houses, performing (songs and poems), and planning a wedding."
5,"Beautiful, powerful and entrancing",I heard this CD from outside the store and the music literally drew me inside to buy it. Perahia's interpretation of each standard is masterful and entrancing. Buy it and you will listen to it again and again - the music is wonderful and the CD quality is great.
2,Seat Covers,"This new purchase of the Type S SC11721B-6 covers was made to replace one from 4 years ago purchased at a local auto store. The new covers are alot cheaper. Less material, the insert in the back to keep the cover down into the turn of the seat was cracked when recieved and continued to fall apart as it was installed. The material on the edge skirts is shorter so that they do not cover the seat below as the older units did. I removed the new unit, washed the old ones and re-installed them, still looking good after 4 years. The new one, well, it will go to my son's car when he gets it."
1,NOT Waterproof or Water Resistent,I purchased these for my jeep because neoprene is waterproof but these are not made from neoprene or wetsuit material and are not waterproof or water resistant in the least. The fit was not very good either. Total waste of money!
2,car seat cover,"First of all i got wrong colour. I asked for a blue , i got black !!! At least i was expecting a combination of dark and light blue , but i got combination of black and blue .Buying just one cover dose not make sense , it will not gel with the interiors. I thought its water proof cover , but it is not . It is just water repellent to some extent . i shall not buy it again , sorry ."
3,Good plot - weak details,"This is a good mystery (as are most in this series), but it suffers from inaccurate detail in some areas. A friend of mine, who is a librarian, couldn't even read past the first chapter because she kept exploding in horror over the treatment of rare and valuable books. Even I noticed when our heroine casually picks up an old volume on display and just casually carries it back to the curator. Worth reading, but not if you know and care about proper library behavior."
3,"Entertaining, but not useful to serious poker players","This book comes across as a well-written collection of stories from a poker-cheat. Many are interesting, and many of the techniques for cheating he lists are plausible. As the author states, the only defense to sophisticated cheating is to change tables whenever you suspect ""something is afoul"". There is no real other guidance on how to detect the advanced forms of cheating.I was disappointed in the author's lack of understanding in general gambling theory, which was showcased in his analysis of the World Series of Poker collusion. His explanation of why the same players often do well in WSOP bordered on ""conspiracy theory""; it was clear he did not understand how and why the best players in the game succeed.Despite my criticisms, this book was very entertaining. It won't teach you anything about cheating you can't think of yourself, but it is a good read, and written such that you can digest its 200+ pages like a fast-food novel."
1,Total Nonsense,"These unfounded complaints and about how online poker is ""rigged"" have been going on forever. Why would any site risk gaining a such a reputation? The online poker community would let it be known within seconds that any certain site was proven to be rigged. The sites are making plenty in rake as it is.Collusion - sure, it happens - but it is not nearly as effective nor pandemic as the author would have you believe. And collusion is very detectable in online poker, as the site can review the hole cards of every player post-hand.This drivel reads like the 256 page testimony of a losing poker player."
2,"Arrogant tone, and rather full of himself","Simply put, can you trust a book written by a man who made his living telling lies and cheating people out of money? I feel like I was cheated out my money by buying this book! Shame on me! ;)"
3,Good,"Gift for Dad again.. this time he says ""it's okay"". Not too many things he didn't already know."
5,Fantastic,"I bought this for my six year old son. It took him about 45 minutes to put it together without my help. He loved it, following the pictures, he got most of it right. I had to correct a few errors, but over all he did a great job. I admit I love Legos to, and was very tempted to put it together myself.He loved the way the hands move. How the back flips open to review the hidden compartment. He learn a little about hinges and howed they worked. Also learn a little about using pieces to reenforce sections. He applied this to building other things from his free style Legos.Only thing the pieces holding the hidden men, come off too easily. Otherwise this is a great toy."
5,Preferable to Pinnock,"Bruno Weil (as always in his Haydn recordings) directs a very fine performance of perhaps Haydn's greatest Mass setting, the ""Nelson Mass."" Trevor Pinnock's much-praised version on Archiv may have a SLIGHT edge dramatically, but with painful mispronunciations of church Latin (see my review of Pinnock's disc) it cannot be recommended over Weil's. Weil also has the advantage in having a boy's choir, though the soprano and alto soloists are women. The only possible reservation concerns the soprano soloist, whose singing is very fine, but whose small sound is sometimes trampled on by the orchestra."
4,A Must Have for Brookie Lovers,"Brook trout are my favorite trout (or Char, as the author corrects us) and there's a lot more to this book than the fish itself. It describes the history of the fish from a regional perspective, explaining why, for example, the fishing in New York is the way it is and how amazing America's brookie rivers once were. After reading it, I had a new perspective on American history.Karas provides ample attention to how environmental problems have damaged the quality of brookie rivers as well.One thing a reader should be aware of, however, is that the book is light on tactics for actually catching brookies. It's much more about why the fish is in the state it's in and what it used to be before man ruined the brookie's habitat.Nevertheless, I was so engrossed in the history provided and the beautiful photos that I didn't mind not getting out of the book what originally inspired me to buy it--how to catch brookies. I've read the book twice and enjoyed it each time."
3,"Informative, but OK","An entertaining and comprehensive look at brook trout. I was expecting a bit more on the biology of the fish, although that may be a subject for more specialized texts. It seems to be a well-researched book, but it does suffer from a good many typos. A few are expected in any long work, but this book had 30 or more. Minor to be sure, but distracting, and it makes one wonder to what extent the author's research suffers from similar carelessness."
2,A Good Book but Not What I Was Hoping Fo,"This book is long on historic details and trophy fishng areas, but it is scant on brook trout biology and behavior. I was hoping for a in depth sharing of some of the scientific studies and findings that help the angle better understand s.f."
5,Great Series,When I first purchased earlier series of Frost - I was not to sold on this show. But the longer I watched the more I liked him/series. I am now hooked on it. I will be ordering the next DVD of the show.
2,Fashion Now 2 (Big Art) (v. 2),I was really disappointed by this book as it doesn't go into enough detail about each designer. Because it is written in three languages it appears to have more infomation in it than it does. A very superficial coverage at best. Not what I was expecting at all. If it wasn't going to cost me $37 in postage to return it I would have asked for my money back.
1,HDMI Connector Breaks,Plate is made of all plastic and HDMI connector broke away from plate while installing to the wall.
4,Good value,A great collection of fights for the money. There may have been some politics behind the decisions on what to include here but I am still happy to have this collection.
4,"Great Value, good collection to own","I'm not sure how they rated the fights to get this order, but damn there were some great fights that need to be in any fight fan's collection. I would like to have seen a few more extras. Overall, I'm glad I bought this disc set."
4,great intro to UFC,"If you have been curious about the UFC and what all the hype is about, this is is a good place to start. A great overview of what the UFC is and what makes it great. By the end, you will really have respect for these athletes and the strength and endurance they must have to do this for a living. I was on the fence about UFC before watching this and it really solidified my appreciation of the sport."
3,Ultimate 100 Greatest Fights,"l was a little irritated because the product info said this was a DVD collection, and when l opened it l saw that it was in fact Blu-Ray, which l don't have a player for. So l got a perfectly good product l couldn't use. A pain in the ass, for sure."
3,Expensive but really good,"It was inspiring to see so many good fighters in one package. Liddell really rocks and these are some of his best fights here. The photography is sometimes better in some scenes then others but this is understandable considering they were taped in so many diffrerent situations. My main criticism is just that it is kind of expensive for fights that for the most part, have taken place a while ago."
3,Rehashed UFC SPIKE programming,"$90.00 is not worth the 5 hr programming ( including commercials )they put on Spike. For anything more than $40.00 they should show the fights in their entirety.In addition, many of the fights seemed to highlight fighters currently being pushed by the UFC or fighters under long term contract. There were plenty of fights from the first 25 ufc events that could have been placed on the program over some of the weaker selections placed on the program.As I stated previously, if this is the same program featured on Spike, wait for it and dvr it. $90.00 is an inflated value for this item."
1,UFC over-hyped,"I just got news about UFC 104 - Rua won, but judges gave it to Machida. Loud boos. Why? Evidently Machida has better contract with UFC. This casts a pall over UFC events. Your consumer strategy should be not to buy UFC events until they cleasn up their act. Including this DVD, which is just a recording of the shows on cable TV."
5,Well worth it,"A lot of people complain that there are fights that deserve to be in this collection that aren't. Sure I agree I've seen some great fights that could easily bump a couple out of their spot on this roster, but this collection is as entertaining as it comes. Close your eyes and pick a disk, hit play and you are going to see some great mixed martial arts. This isn't the history of UFC, it's fights picked and ranked by the fans, and while the specifics can be argued, the gist is this: Great fights. Sooner than later the UFC will be able to produce ""100 MORE Greatest Fights"""
3,Good for price,This is a good mix of fights that will keep a ufc fan entertained for a while.I got this set back on release date and it was around $80 at the time.Personally I can care less about the older fights. I only watched the fights that are within 5-6 years old.For the price now $20 it's a great deal.
2,"Arrived Today, part misleading.","The description is misleading, the picture shows the strut with Boot/bumper, only struts are in the box no boot or bumper. When I ordered this I was expecting to receive what is shown, not so. Disappointed."
2,It's an OK radio for jogging,"I gave this radio 2 stars; one for the preset buttons, which I need if I want to change stations while I'm jogging, and one for the long life of the AAA batteries. Beyond that, the belt clip fell off and got lost a long time ago, so I have to either keep the radio in a zipped pocket, or hold it in my hand. Unfortunately while I'm holding it, the battery cover tends to pop off. The pulse checker is worthless. The headphones that came with the radio were poor quality and uncomfortable. I gave them to my rabbit for a chew toy."
1,Look for another radio,"Although the size of the radio is decent I find the reception is weak and the battery door keeps popping open, causing a loss of preset stations and reseting the clock. You can find a better radio with better reception for less money."
5,A GREAT PERFORMANCE!,"I have loved the Yellowjackets since I began listening to them several years ago. This is the first video I have of them, and I was not disappointed.The audio was crisp and clear and the hi def video images were razor sharp. The band did a magnificent job and the concert was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish."
3,Over-rated Product,"I saw this item about 20 yrs back at Williams Sonoma. After using it 2x and really seeing it in action, in my opinion, it's over-rated. It's good, but all this heavy base material doesn't equate to great tasting food, or quicker cooking. I preped the grill, but food still stuck to it... means I have to prep the food better. Too humbug. Will use as a back up or better yet, get a non-stick grill top from Home Depot and prop it up w/ bricks for different heights. Would not buy this again. Amazon delivery service is excellent. Am impressed."
1,COOKING GRID/GRILL RUSTS BADLY,"I purchased your Hibachi-style Charcoal Grill (L410) May 2011 and the cooking grill/grid is rusting terribly. There are spots where the rust is coming off in layers.My built-in gas grill has cast iron grids/grills and after nine years only get surface rust which is easily wiped off.At the rate the grid/grill is rusting, it will be rusted through and destroyed in another year.The grill is stored out of the weather and has never been rained on.Other than the cooking grill/grid, the rest of the unit shows minimal surface rust.Lodge says, ""The grill is losing its seasoning. I would recommend re-seasoning."" DUH!, The first time you cook over charcoal producing temperatures well over 1000F, any seasoning is GONE.Be careful with this grill."
4,darbman7,This is a excellent grill for a small picnic or camping . It is very user friendly other than the item is heavy .Definitely a quality product which is great for outdoor use where you are driving to a spot for camping or a day trip.
4,Amazing product for the money,"This is quite an amazing product for the money, especially considering that the shipping is free for this well made, heavy little stove. My only complaint is that when fully assembled, the unit doesn't hang right from the handle, but wants to tip to one side. You can take off the little doors and solve that problem, but I knocked one star off. Otherwise perfect!"
5,Pretty cool,I was originally looking for a hibachi but it seems there is only one brand available which made in China. I had one of them and it was a piece of garbage. The Lodge Sportsman's grill was the next best thing. Yes it's rather heavy and don't have any accessories however it cooks fast with very little charcoal. If you use this regularly you'll easily get your money back the first season on fuel savings. Hint... forget what you know about BBQ. You only need a couple handfuls of coals to cook up some steaks.
2,Clean-up is a b---h!,"No problems with the way it cooks. The problem comes with the clean-up. I'm used to a kettle-type grill with an ash receiver underneath. But, this thing has a cast-iron cooking grid. Meat sticks to it like you would not believe. And, I have seasoned it, liberally, with lard. EVERY time you cook on it, meat sticks to the grid and you can't effectively brush it off with a grill brush, no matter how hot the grill is. Because the unit is small, cooking results in grease splattering everywhere - you literally can not pick the thing up without getting grease all over your hands. It does have a handle on it, but if you pick up the unit with the grid and front doors in place, it tilts to the front. It is necessary to remove the front doors. I'm sorry - I just don't like it. All my kettle grill requires is to dump in the charcoal, light it, put the cooking grid in place and use the grill brush on it - the old residue just falls down in the fire and burns up. For me, simpler is better."
1,Broke on first use,The cast iron stove/grill cracked on the first use. Pour casting I guess.The meal was good but expensive!
3,Serious Safety Issue,The Sportsman Grill is a nice tool for a quick meal. However if you wish to sear your food you need tons of charcoal as the cooking surface is too far from the heat. Thus you must pile your fuel almost up to the rim. Do not try to move your grill the bail handle is so off balance the fire door flips open and lit coals fall first on you then on the deck.There should have been a warning in the box at minimum.
4,Nice little grill,"First, it does just what it's supposed to do. It's very solidly built, and should last a very long time with a little bit of care (standard for cast iron). Definitely has some heft, has a good-sized area for the charcoal, and a pretty good-sized cooking grate.Bought it for my lady, who already had a Weber gas grill--she's very fond of this little gem.Reason why only 4 stars: It's not balanced properly when lifted by the wire bail; it'd be very nice if there were a lid available, and it's kind of a pain to empty the ashes.I'd buy it again. Heck, I'd buy me one, 'cept that I kinda hope to get fulltime sharing use of this one soonish. :)"
4,A Manly Grill for Manly Men,"Good heavy gauge, two level grill with just enough space for four good sized steaks. Fires up nicely and a drop down door makes it easy to rearrangethe coals. Strange name, though. The logic is lost on me."
5,delighted,"You have exceeded my expectation in quality, service, delivery, accuracy and return policy. Free shipping and no sales tax makes amazon.com an unbeatable shopping site.Kind Regards,Moe MajordyParsons, TN"
2,Cracked Grill,"Since you asked...Yes, I wanted to buy a product that was made in the USA out of cast iron and would last for a generation or two. I just received an emailed request from Amazon to review my purchase and happened to fire it up to grill some chicken tonight. To my dismay, I found a crack that went clear through one edge of the cooking surface. I am not too pleased. I have only had this Lodge Sportsman's grill for a matter of weeks and can count the number of times I have used it on my fingers.I have not abused the grill in any way. So what will Amazon or Lodge do to make this right? I would give the product more than just 2 stars if something can be done. Maybe this is just a casting flaw but I wouldn't want to give one of these grills as a gift and find out later that the thing broke after just a few uses. As heavy as it is, I would think that it would be sturdier."
2,Defective bolt hole,I bought this and had it shipped to Japan where I live- it looks lovely but one of the bolt holes at the base is too small for the bolt- I broke a file trying to file it open..and am too far away to exchange..
4,Great little grill.,"Lodge makes a great product. As with everything else, expensive, but well built and will last years if properly cared for.It was delivered in a timely manner."
2,Not as Good as It Looks,Lodge makes good products. Long lasting and hard working. But this grill is nothing but an expensive Hibachi.It has a small surface and it needs a cover to use while cooking. Sorry I bought it.
2,Neanderthals Designed This BBQ,"Robust construction throughout, but really lacks some subtle niceties that are found in less expensive BBQs. There's only two grill height settings and you cant easily change heights when the grill is hot and cooking (the grill surface itself flips over to cause the height change). There is a door provided to stoke the coals that appears to be a needless feature. The hibachi's feet are not insulated and can get pretty hot, so beware of placement on high-value surfaces. The draft door is heavy and easily separates from the body. The heavy door already tagged me once on the foot as I was emptying the BBQ of ash. Really?, I'd give it a 2 out of 10 for usefullness as compared to better designed hibachis that I've used in the past. Conclusion: the making of a cheap, convenient, and efficient cast iron Hibachi BBQ may very well be a lost art."
4,Cast Iron Hibachi,"This item, although expensive in my mind, is high quality and works well. It is ""cured"" from the factory and can be set up and used in minutes. It is flexible in the ways you can set up the grill and it has a draft slide to control the heat. The only drawback is when you carry it with the wire handle, it isn't balanced well. It will likely last a lifetime unless left out in the rain."
3,Not bad,"The first unit I recieved had a cracked fire bowl. Cast iron is brittle... Within a week a replacement was at my door. That's great service. I only have one concern:The loader door has small tabs that act like hinges. Considering this unit is cast iron, I believe those tabs can break off just by dropping the door or pulling open too far. Then, the door won't stay in place in when open.One wish:The unit should come with adjustable grill heights for heat adjustment. Using the vent door to adjust heat doesn't really work well.The thick and heavy grill is great for heat retention and even cooking.Overall, the unit is great for small batches and portability. Not really good for a whole rack of ribs or a couple of 28oz Porterhouse slabs. Can't expect too much for $39 bucks..."
5,A Terrific Little Grill,"We have been grilling with gas for a long time and thought it might be fun to get back to basics and so we bought this grill. My wife has long complained about the lack of true grilled flavor and serious grill marks. And this grill delivers both great tasting and good looking food.Everything we've tried has been terrific, steaks, pork chops, lamb chops and burgers.However, when it is time to do a roast or a turkey we'll have to fire up the Weber but otherwise the Lodge is the way to go."
5,Everything was perfect and hubby is very happy.,"I got this grill for my hubby, and were totally satisfied with the purchase. This is the perfect outdoor cooking grill, It really is the perfect size, big enough to cook for 4 adults. We've used it to cook steaks, burgers, and chicken. Everything was perfect and clean up was fast and easy."
3,Grill,"Outstanding quality. It's only shortcoming is lack of a lid, even as an option. Makes it a little difficult to use in cold or windy weather."
4,Lodge Grill,"I ended up buying both the Lodge and Cajun grills so here is my comparison of the two. The most noticeable difference is in the quality of the casting. The Cajun is made in China and is shows. The grill grate has small bubbles and imperfections that don't exist on the Lodge. Overall the cast iron is simply inferior on the Cajun. The access door to the ashes is very poorly designed and falls out easily. I am sure it will break one of these times when it hits the patio concrete just right. I bought the Cajun because it had a larger grill surface. If the larger grill surface is important to you then go with the Cajun. Both do what you expect a cast iron hibachi to do....there is nothing that compares in my opinion. Bottom line, the Lodge is a noticeably higher quality and better designed product but they both do the same thing. Both manufacturers placed large medallion logos in the middle of the grill surface....not a good idea....messes with the all important grill marks."
5,Excellent Small Grill,This is a wonderful grill. We had a little hibachi back in the 70s that we used on the back porch where we worked to cook burgers for lunch. I have been looking for something similar and found something much better. Grilling steaks or shrimp for two - it is perfect. Great quality. I may be buying these for gifts.
4,The best on the market,"Bought this from Amazon after seeing it at the Lodge store in Tennessee. Was on sale so ended up saving $50!! Is a great grill/hibachi. Is thick heavy cast iron so takes a while to heat up, figure a hour or more and make sure the coals are completely gray.Grills everything perfectly. Make sure is on a sturdy, non flamable surface as even the feet get hot.One caution, is very heavy (about 30 pounds) so if you have a problem lifting anything that heavy make sure you have someone to lift it for you. It does come with a stainless handle."
5,small and powerful grill,Bought this for my husband. He loves it because it gets to a high heat for searing and cooks evenly. We got rid of a large grill (we have another large gas grill) and keep this for smaller meals. More efficient and economical. Love it.
4,Great little grill for 2-4 people,"I love cooking on this grill. It gets extremely hot and is awesome for steaks, burgers, and boneless chicken.Paired with the rapid fire charcoal starter it cooks juicy, tasty food with wonderful grill marks.TIPS: I pour a basket full or red hot charcoal from the fire starter and let the grill heat for 15 minutes. Pound chicken breast out to 1/2 inch and cook for 4 minutes each side. Everything cooks fast, but retains juice well. Only con is that the cast iron will rust if left in the rain, but I clean then store mine in the shed after it cools down."
