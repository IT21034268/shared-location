4,The ubiquitous Neil Patrick Harris in his early sitcom days,Well worth a look for those who remember Doogie and for those who think Neil Patrick Harris is only the host of every awards show and star of How I Met Your Mother.
2,Some Shoddy Construction,"We bought this cabinet to hold our coffee pots in the kitchen. We didn't attach the top portion to assure ease of access. The dowel and cam method generally used in this type of furniture often will suffice. However in this case the frame was adequately held together, but the drawers/cabinet doors were very poorly aligned. The bottom cabinet doors are held by a screwed in plate with an upright pin. The matching portion is screwed to the cabinet door edge and sits over the pin. The drawers came with the rails attached to the sides but the ones inside the cabinet had to be screwed into place. The pieces fit together so poorly the drawers actually catch sometimes when a lower cabinet door is open. If you life up when shutting a drawer the cabinet door on the right hand side will pop open. Rather than attempting to adjust the various screw holes in this type of wood, we are buying a better quality piece to hold our coffee items in our kitchen."
2,"disappointed, not wood and poorly engineered.","pro: looks good in my kitchencons: 1. drawers are not deep enough, cant even hold a sheet of paper without folding it, even though the cabinet has room for a longer drawer. poorly engineered.2. its not wood, looks like wood but the broken piece of cabinet proves it is made of compressed wood fiber.3. some of the screw holes did not line up. one of the drawer face plates was drilled completely opposite of the way it should be and would have been upside down if I had put it together that way.4. doors are flimsy and feel like they are going to break just opening them because the magnets are pulling so hard. I had to move the metal magnet plates away from the magnets in order for the doors to open nicely.5. for a little more money I could have bought a real wood version from a furniture store without the hassle."
3,A tad on the smaller side,"The price was not the greatest, but with Prime, it was worth it. It is VERY WELL packaged as it comes in two separate ultra heavy duty boxes. Assembly took a few hours as there are lots of small pieces and screws. Some things didn't line up perfectly, therefore, you have to find your own trick to deal with it if you don't want to take it apart and ask for a replacement. I.E.: the bottom cabinet door magnet is misaligned with one of the doors, so I have to kinda lift the door a bit before closing.The main issue for us was that the top cabinet is very narrow. Most dinning sets are usually about 11"" (or larger), and this one will not hold anything larger than 10.25"" and that's the reason why we haven't gotten a new set of plates yet.Anyhow, it did help alleviate some of our storage issues, so I can't say that it is completely useless. It is of a nice design and color. It kinda looks like a dollhouse furniture."
1,Be wary of this one,"I bought this about 8 months ago. I used it a few times and was satisfied with it. After not using it for four months while I was away, it won't work anymore. I'm not sure if the problem is that it won't take a charge or something else. After leaving it on the charger for hours, it does absolutely nothing."
4,Good basic drill/driver for home projects,"Nothing fancy, but handles most household tasks with ease. Save a few dollars compared to the name brand versions. Handy carrying case."
1,No power,This cordless screwdriver has no power and the smallest of screws locks up the Denali. I doubt I will ever use this for any projects and it has been put away
2,Disappointed,"I just wanted to send a quick note that I am a bit disappointed in this screwdriver. After reading all the reviews, I was excited and thought i got a great deal. But after the first use, I found that this ""drill"" doesn't have a lot of power. I simply tried to screw seat cushions onto chairs, and it was powerful enough to get them 2/3 of the way in. I had to finish them by hand. If it can't screw small screws into seat cushions, I would hate to think of trying anything on a larger scale. In my opinion, this is for jobs that require very low torque and nothing more."
3,little jobs,i think this product would be helpful as it has for me in the home when you need a quick fix...i mean rather than bringing out the big tools that have more power but not needed for the job..thanks
3,Okay for Small Jobs,"This is okay for easy materials like drywall and soft wood if you are using short screws. Also, the screw and drill bits are of low quality. I've already had to throw away the #2 phillips head and I've only used the screwdriver 6 or 7 times."
3,I had to fix it by myself,"After charge the battery correctly, i tried to work with the screwdriver. But, It didn't spin. i did many tries, but It was useless. I had to open the screwdriver and check all the pieces out and i found out the system spin was stuck. I had to grease it.I rebuild the screwdriver and make tries again.Finally, the screwdriver worked.it's a shame that amazon does not check the items out before sell them.Now, I work with the screwdriver everyday. Speaking about funtionality.. screwdriver works excelente, it has so much power to work. this item is great option for homework."
1,I'd pass on this product,"I purchased this product but didn't have ocassion to use it until several months later. When I did want to use it, I took it out of the box and tried to charge it, but it wouldn't take a charge. By that time the receipt was long lost... Total waste of money. One star seems to be the lowest rating I can give; it wouldn't accept no stars, but that's what it deserves."
1,Received defective drill,I purchased this around Christmas 2006 and didn't have a chance to use it till April 2007. Charged up the unit per the instructions and it doesn't work. Led light does not work. It is missing the magnet to hold the bit in the drill. Very disappointed. Next time I'll make sure to check an item so I can return it back to Amazon within the returns period.
1,Dead on Arrival,"I pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. I plugged it into the charger and got a green (fully charged) indicator light. I tried the light. It didn't work either. I put it back in the box and returned it for a refund. If you want a small lithium driver, get a Bosch. Expensive, but worth every penny."
5,A very different sound for the mandolin.,"Chicago Style is exactly that...historic pieces played by a legend in the jazz mandolin in a distinct style I haven't heard elsewhere. I'm not sure how Rachell has tuned his instrument, but it is definately a distinct and enoyable sound. A worthwhile addition to any mandolin or jazz library."
5,Pop Unknown turn Arsenic and Algebra into things of BEAUTY,"I am a huge fan of all of Pop Unknown's work....but this album by far exceeded my expectations! The layers of melodic guitar rhythms put me in a trans. ""If Arsenic Fails Try Algebra"" is an all-together great record. I love the vocals, lyrics, beautiful music, and the new pop twist. In ""Half of Ninety"" the upbeat guitar rhythms and the unique drum-style of Gabe W. (ex: mineral) are almost haunting. This is one song that will definately stick in your head for the rest of the day! I don't have a favorite song yet because they are all great...the only song I disliked in any way shape or form is now growing on me, so I have NO COMPLAINTS! Finally, a Texas band worth listening to and writing about! Everyone's a critic...so I urge you all to check it out for yourselves. It will be well worth the effort. Thanks for wasting time reading my silly little review."
4,Great for this physically limited user!,"I agree with all the positive points the other reviewers had touched on. I just want to add that I have fibromyalgia, and have a problem with muscle fatigue and spasms when I do physical activity, especially in my back. This unit is lightweight, and when the bag is slung across your shoulder correctly, it doesn't feel that heavy, even when the bag is full. I had more problems dealing with the slope and tree branches than I did with the unit itself. The only way I would improve it would be with an optional extension for the tube, so taller people could use it without having to bend over to get the intake tube close enough to the leave when vacuuming. (I'm 5'8"")"
2,Four Play and Colin Firth,"I'm a great fan of Colin Firth and try to view everything he does. I did not enjoy this movie at all. The story just did not hold together and Heminghway did not help it. I often wonder why successful actors, such as Mr. Firth bother to do movies like this, when he can pick and choose. I am sure the only reason people buy this is beause he is in it. Of course, just looking at Colin is fun, but don't buy this movie for the storyline."
2,Waste of time.,"A romantic comedy that is neither. It plays and feels like one of those investigative films about some crime of which I'm not sure anyone really knows. There's nothing really funny here. Hemmingway is her usual gorgeous self, Firth is as solid a performer as ever, and, well, beyond that it's not worth a whole lot.Pass it up."
2,Good Effort but not Best in Class,"... This movie is also known as Londinium (which by the way is the name of the book a character writes).This was a pretty predictable movie. Not one that I would classify as a Romantic Comedy. Maybe better classified as a Drama gone wrong??Colin Firth was delightful, as always. However, Mariel Hemingway was not.Colin plays a TV producer of one of the hottest shows in Britain who is married to the shows star (Mariel Hemingway). A TV writer is acquired from America. He of course lusts after the Star. Much predictableness ensues as The Star and the Writer set out to put their respective partners in a situation where adultery can occur.We end with the one couple committed to each other and the other going their separate ways.I'd give this movie a ""C"". Good effort but not top of the class!"
2,foul play,"not happy with this one- have watched it twice in two days to try to find something more to like about it- without success. The story is OK, but there is not a lot of comedy in this 'sex-comedy' ( there's not a lot of sex either ), apart from the scenes with Stephen Fry as a therapist. Binder seems to be trying to emulate Woody Allen's style and character in this movie. The remaining characters do their bit, but there is not a lot to work with in a story about two couples who switch partners."
3,Worth buying if you are a Colin Firth fan...,"It's predictable, slow in some parts, seems to try too hard to be funny in other parts (and I have wondered for years how Mariel Hemingway ever earned the title 'actress')and all in all a mediocre movie. But, it's worth seeing for Colin fans and the great scene between Colin, Stephen Fry, and Irene Jacobs.Buy it used and put in in your collection next to <shudder> 'Hour of the Pig'. ;-)"
4,Fun and entertaining,"I so enjoyed this movie, it made me laugh and the cast is great. Saw it first on you tube and just had to buy it. Colin Firth is excellent as always."
2,dissapointing,"Could not get through it, sorry, bad choice, for me, others however may like it. Storyline was not condusive. Have come to the conclusion that Colin Firth my idol, played roles in some stinkers"
2,Thumb's Down on American Heritage Children's Dictionary,"I bought this dictionary for my 1st grader. It had great pictures, and the vocabulary was such that I felt like my son could pick it up and read anything in it. When I showed it to him he was excited, but immediately saw a word he didn't know. Then it dawned on me that it did not contain any phonetic pronunciations for any of the words! Isn't this a key ingredient to a dictionary? I am returning the book for one that does contain pronunciations for each word. I want my children to be able to look up any word they want to know and learn how to pronounce it and learn what it means. If they have to ask someone else, it renders the ""reference"" book worthless, in my opinion, and discourages future use of the book. Decide for yourselves, though."
3,early elementary only,"I bought this dictionary at the end of First grade, thinking it would last through Elementary school Now, he's in 3rd grade, and this year, he's been unable to find 3 words. Last year, he couldn't locate two words. It's aggravating because I want him to learn how to look words up, and spell them correctly. But, he can't find them in the dictionary! I do not remember what the words were, but I doublechecked with him and they were typical words in a third grader's vocabulary, but not in the dictionary. I am now seeking a new dictionary."
5,Great Kid's Dictionary,"I bought this dictionary for my daughter when she started first grade - knowing that it would be a while until her reading skills were good enough for her to use it. Beginning in about the 2nd grade, she started to use it regularly - and in 3rd grade (last year) she used it all the time. Terrific first dictionary for a kid, with great pictures in full color, good art and illustrations, nice bold type, etc. What's nice about it is that it's layout is just like a grown-up dictionary - which they will switch to in time. This is a perfect dictionary for a grade schooler to learn to do 'research' with appropriate elementary school/junior high vocabularly. Highly recommended!"
4,An essential kids dictionary,I am a homeschooling Mom and we use it every day! Great pictures. Only slight drawback is that not every word we need is listed in it - most are though. Althogether a good investment.
2,Rusts easily.,"These rusted almost immediately. They can't be put in the dishwasher, and if any drop of water remains, they'll rust within hours. Mine must have been still damp near the seams because they were already rusted a few hours after I washed and dried them."
5,mini cutters,"These little darlings were smaller than I expected... but that is fine. I wanted them to cut out centers of the cookies, so they are perfect."
3,too small,I thought these cookie cutters were going to be much larger than what they actually were. They are about the size of a quarter. Very cute for bite-size treats!
2,Really too small for words,"I knew ordering that the cookie cutter would be smaller than your average, but this was TOO small for my needs. The cookies cut with this cutter will literally be perfectly fit into the hand of a toddler. Also, because the cutter is too small, I found it hard to work with using my adult-sized hands. Shapes are pretty and that's what made me get it in the first place, but not really practical unless you are wanting tiny cookies for a specific occasion."
5,Jon Secada is on the path to Latin/Pop superstardom.,"This is Jon's second CD and while trying to get the American contemporary music consumers to love his music he may have tried just a little too hard. His vocals are rich, even though some of the lyrics may be lacking, but this still doesn't overshadow this wonderful CD which is a great addition to any collection."
3,Vivid,"For Jon secada, he remains as one of those Where Are They Now? casualties leftover from VH1. It is just sad that he hasn't released anything new to top Heart, Soul & A Voice. Although my mother has this record and I don't, I still listen to a lot of songs on this record including Mental Picture, and If You Go. It is a strong record, from somebody who sang backup for Gloria Estefan. Hopefully, somebody with a voice like that should try to comeback all the way to the top, but I doubt it will happen."
4,This is a book I would recommend,"This is what our 11 year old son had to say about this book: ""This is a very exciting book! It's in a perfect mideaveal setting, in which Robert (who is cautious) and his little sister Alice (who is a lot less cautious) go on an adventure to find their mysterious Uncle Raimond, but on the way have to deal with, Hunger, theives, and biggest of all imprisonment in a tower. The only thing I dislike about this book, is that it is not longer!!"""
5,picked up the ball after HD dropped it,"This blade is the replacement for the Ryobi edger formerly sold by HD. They no longer carry the replacement blade, and this one is not only cheaper but ordering is a snap."
5,Perfect Woman's Flaw,"I have never read a book that talked more about myself. It will ease your mind, relieve stress, and most of all make you realize that you can't do everything. No body is PERFECT, so don't try to be. I don't have time to write all that I can, but please continue to publish this book. It can save lives. Better yet, put it on cassette."
5,Perfectionism hinders relationships and faith in God,"This book teaches one how to go from being ""In"" control to ""God"" control. Although some women may believe they've got it all together, would do anything for anyone, they may be miserable from their own expectations of others. If you are one who feels put upon, not loved or appreciated for all you do, you may need to read this book. There are underlying reasons why one believes they are doing for others (controlling)and / or why they must be perfect. If you do, there is a simple way to turn your life around by putting God in control first, then everything else will work out in God's plan and within his own time. Read the book. I found it enlightening. Even if you do not consider yourself 100% perfect, there may be something in there for you, too. I found parts of me in there. So I will ""hear, see and remember"" God first."
5,Great for getting your flexibity and you can use at work,"I had knee surgery and the Physical Therapists had me work out with this to regain stretch. I promptly bought one from Amazon for home and even one for bedside. They were ""absconded"" by my 30 yr old children who found them intriguing and easy to use. After all .... I could use the thing. I now have one at work and try to use it daily as well as my home version. The strap has Lots of places for handholds so you are never out of a secure hold. You only really need the strap - the video was okay."
5,Kiko is wicked,I have been playing guitar for more than 20 years and I have to say Kiko has some top notch chops. He also is a fantastic teacher and covers a wide range of material going from rock to fusion to jazz.
5,heavy praise is due for this debut!,"Oh yeah! I got vol. 2 first and had to go back for vol. 1, and I am so glad I did. Everything I.M. does is great. No complaints at all with my purchase. Can't wait for the next one."
5,Revolutionary 1 is the best,This is immortal techniques first album and is a classic he talks about a lot of factual stuff and is a very concious rapper. Dance with the devil is the highlight of this album as it talks about a kid who grows up and gets an infatuation with living a gangster life style and is one of the best songs i have ever heard.
3,Brings some energy...,"If you are deciding between this album and his second album, get the second album. Someone else noted that the album was not put together well and I would second that point. I felt the strongest parts of the album were not the raps but the poetry without hard beats in the background. These were thoughtful and well stated. However, the talk about vegetarians was the stupidest thing I have ever heard on an album and should not be on it. Aside from that, Technique brings energy to be admired and a passion that is addictive. However, as I noted with album number 2, the derogatory language toward women and homosexuals is backward thinking and is not even close to being revolutionary."
5,Unbelievable,"This entire album is of tha chain, but besides immortal, his prospect DIABOLIC is showing signs of a young BIG L wit lyrics such as""Go head n grip glocks,ill snap ya trigga finger in six spots,youll have to liplock wit a hyperdermic needle to lick shots"" This album is Fire"
1,"Not a Revolution, weak music, don't buy.","Here we go, another racist rapper who blames every problem he has had or people that look like him has ever had on white people, the beats are ok, all samples of other peoples music really, rhymes, well some will say truth but really not at all, immortal whatever suffers the big problem most people suffer, unable to except responsibility for their own mistakes and problems, I guess it's just easier to blame someone else for anything wrong in the world and who is the perfect scape goat for low self esteem ignorant racist people like this guy and ( most rappers ), the white man of course, if he has such a problem with America then maybe he should move back to Peru."
1,Lame and Lamer,"I've never liked any of this concious rap garbage that has come out and this is no exeption. This is just another attempt by the American lefts and the extremists in the hip hop purist movement to push their beliefs on the rest of us and to politicize music and entertainment in general even further. These songs are just plain terrible. The beats suck, Tech's performance is awful, and his topics are boring. This isn't music, this is a propaganda tape and nothing more. I will give Tech props for his lyrics but this album is just awful, boring, lame, and poorly produced, his lyrics just can't save it."
4,Pretty Good,When i first bought this cd i had no idea what to expect i just knew that i had heard a lot about immortal technique. so i needed a sample. now when i first listened to the cd i thought to myself you know its pretty good then i took a break for a few months. then one day i was debating on waht to listen to and i saw this cd and said why not. i listened to and i have decided that the song dance with the devil is worht the 15 bones ull pay for this cd. along with having some strong opening songs like dominant species and creation & destruction this is a very solid cd. technique has great lyrics the only drawback is that i dont think that the production on this cd is very good. some weak beats really ruin songs that could be good. dance with the devil is one of the best songs ive ever heard and this idiot below that says this is wack and commercial pop/rap is good is a dumb broad. check this album out.
3,Bags blow out easily,"The vaccum/blower it's self works great, but the bag seams keep blowing out. Replacement bags are $35.00 each and at that rate, it does not pay for itself. We have had ours for 3 years. Within the first 6 months we needed a new bag. We were very careful to keep the second bag emptied and it blew out in under 6 months. That would of been $70.00 in replacement bags in the first year. My husband wrapped the hole with wire and then it blew a hole else where in the seam. For the last year we have been using it as a blower only. I have written Ryobi in regards to the quality of the bag and received no response. If anyone knows of another brand of bag that will fit on the Ryobi and lasts longer, I would appriciate the information."
3,Good blower However....,"The first thing I noticed when I got this blower/Vac and was a little of hard to put to together and the Bag is a little small for Big yards,the customer service at Ryobi could be better if you buy this be a aware some places won't service Ryobi products because they dont get paid back by Ryobi.It's still a good blower with a easy vac switch which I like for picking up leafs and grass and it does do a good job of cleaning up,but the company could do better."
2,Okay for only for 1-2 years,"It's early November in the Northwest and I still have another 3 weeks of leaves to blow and vac. Unfortunately my Ryobi RESV1300 mulching blower vac won't make it thanks to their defective zipper issue. It's annoying, especially for the price I paid. Of course, it worked great last year."
1,Terrible bag - good vacuum,"I will be the second reviewer to warn you not to buy the resv1300 blower/vacuum because the bag's zipper-seams give out within a year. A new bag costs $35.00. In order to salvage the first blower that was still working, I decided to get a second one so I could use its bag on my first one. Same thing. I now have two blower/vacuums and no bag to put on them in order to use the vacuum part. Shame on Ryobi. You have lost a customer for life."
1,terrible electrical connector,"Be aware---the electrical prongs do not hold the extension cord secure even when its wrapped around the plastic body hook. I still had to hold the cord while the blower was in use to keep it from slipping out. After using my new blower for only the second time, it burned a new extension cord and I broke one of the prongs trying to free the blower from the cord. Now the cord and the unit are useless, unless I can get Ryobi to make it good. Definately needs a better design. As a blower, works fine. Didn't use the mulcher feature, so can't comment on that."
2,be very careful,"You must find some way to secure the extension cord. If it slips out slightly, it will melt your extension cord, cause smoking and burn out your machine. Just the movement of use can cause the cord connection to slip. Very dangerous."
3,Great looking watch - problem with the numbers.,"I purchased this watch after loosing a silver one I wore all the time. It seems a bit more contemporary/trendy than my other one and I love it. I have received several compliments. However, after about a month of wearing it the ""3"" and ""9"" someone became dislodged and are floating around in the watch face. Even without those numbers, I still wear it as I like the look and feel."
3,Good writing but happened to the theme song?,"The first four episodes are great in particular the first ""Crime doesnt pay...."" But then for some reason, the animation changes from great to below-average, and what happened to the theme song?On Spike, the Stripperella theme was written and preformed by Kid Rock. In the DVD there's no song. Why? The DVD lacks special features I was expecting. My DVDs also skipped and stuck in about every episode. The DVD set definitley could have been better."
1,Stripped of all claims,"[...]First, the disks are defective. Mine skip huge sections on all the episodes I tried watching, and this is on my DVD player, the Playstation2 and the computer. Booooo...Next, these episodes are NOT UNCENSORED! The boobs are pixilated just like when they aired on TNN/Spike!Third, THE THEME TUNE WAS CHANGED - WTF??? The Kid Rock theme used when it aired on TV was one of its great features.I recommend you DON'T buy this and wait until the technical and political issues are corrected. You can get all this rubbish on K*Z*A for FREE!"
5,I need rescuing!,"Pam Anderson is ""Stripperella"". Erotic dancer / superheroine. She gets into some pretty wacky adventures, but it is fun to watch."
3,No Problems Here...,"I haven't had any problems at all with my two discs. They play just fine and look fine.My only beef would be the change in the animation & writting after episode 4. It became way to 'cutesy' and less crass. No more exposed breasts get shown, no more truely funny innuendos. I felt like I was watching a saturday morning fluffy cartoon.Now I understand why it got cancelled. Someone screwed with it and screwed it up.It is worth buying for the orginial first 4 episodes tho."
4,"definite BUY product, just don't tell the wife you spent so much for a recorder","I never give 5 stars unless I'm blown away.After using a cheap digital recorder to record Choir practice and Sermon review. I decided to splurge and get a good recorder. This is one of the best recorder I have heard. Battery life is good, 16 hours on headset, (I fell asleep while listening). Takes awhile to get use to the buttons, but you quickly realize the thought process behind placement. The remote mic is a wonderful addition. The included case is also great with belt clip loop.I wish it had an SD card slot so it could be used as a music player. It's hard to justify the cost unless you are a professional but that is a personal preference. I have dropped if few times, no issue.This is a definite BUY product if you got the cash, just don't tell the wife you spent so much for a recorder.4 stars because of the cost and cost and lack of a mini SD card slot."
4,"I approve, but would you?","I love this recorder. It is complicated to work, but I don't disapprove. Anybody who is not technologically savvy would have difficulty using this recorder to its full potential. I really like the numerous options it has for recording. My only issue is that I cannot seem to find the right setting out of all the options for each of my classes since they are all varied in size and location. There is a chart though in the manual that attempts to make things easier for the consumer. The recorder has a lot of functions, so I recommend this product for anyone who has to use it for varying situations. If you just need a basic recorder for one type of recording, there are other types out there that are far less complicated and still worthwhile."
4,"Very interesting, but could have used something more","""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" is well written and never fails to intrigue, but I could not help but feel that something was missing. I was unsure of what it was until I saw another review (the one by Amy of Colorado). Tom is never really in danger of being found out: everyone around him is so stupid and self-involved that only one person even suspects a thing (and Tom takes care of that rather quickly). Tom's character desperately needed a match - an antagonist (if you can call Tom the hero) worthy of his skill. While the movie is very different, the two function well together. Each offers what the other is missing (although the book allows a deeper understanding of Tom, which helps a lot). All in all, it's worth reading."
4,"personal review about the novel ""Tom Ripley""","This book impressionates us because in the story of Tom Ripley you can feel the tension growing more and more.And suddenly you get aware of that the author must have thought a lot about that story and its development.Very interesting is, that the caracters are changing during the story and that the locations aren't always the same. So you often get new experiences and because of the very exactly descriptions of the different places and the caracters you can identify yourself with the whole story, you go with the persons very attentif and you are seizing until the last pages. But sometimes the many descriptions get you bored a bit..."
5,Great reader manipulation,"I didn't realize how much I identified with Tom until I read the reviews and found myself defending him every time his character was negatively described. As a matter of fact, I felt insulted when he was insulted and praised when he was praised! Talk about manipulation...I've never been obsessed by anyone in my life, but reading this book, I felt like Tom was my bad conscience (Sort of like the protagonist in ""Fight Club""). I'd resist any risky move he made and then say, ""I sure hope we get away with this one"".It's a worthwhile read; it'll be interesting to see how the movie treats it."
4,Book versus movie,"The book is very interesting and very well-written but I liked the movie more. In the interest of not giving things away to someone who has not read the book, I will only say that I found the characters more believable in the movie version and the action more dramatic. Now it could be due to the fact that I saw the movie first and therefore was coming into the book with preconcieved notions, but Ripley seemed like a more insecure, more flawed and eventually more interesting character in the movie than he was in the book.I still give the book 4 stars because it is very well-written and worth reading. Read the book, see the movie, and then draw your own conclusions.Okay, Highsmith fans, you can stone me now."
2,Waste of Time,"I had only heard positive things regarding this book, but all I can say is that I found it to be an incredible waste of my time. I hated Tom Ripley, not because he was evil or manipulative, but because he was whiny and boring. He complained about the most inane things and if I had to spend any length of time with him, I would have killed myself! I think the basic plot - one man wanting another's life - was original and could have made for an interesting read, but I had trouble staying focused from the beginning. I did not care about any of the characters or their fates. I only finished it because I kept waiting for it to get exciting and, dare I say, dangerous. Tom Ripley is not a frightening psycopath; he is a bore whose life is more uninteresting in fiction than mine is in realtiy."
2,mediocre fiction,"Mr. Ripley may be talented, but Patricia Highsmith is not. The writing is something a third grader could concoct (Dickie wanted to go by Marge's house to see if she was still there. They climbed some steps from the main road up the side of a stone wall, crossed part of somebody's garden, and climbed more steps."" The characters are unbelievable (Dickie's parents, Marge, even Dickie and Tom), and the plot is boring. Who cares if Tom can talk Dickie into going back to the USA and be a drudge in his father's business? Not me."
5,Once again Hollywood Mangles Authors Intentions,"After seeing The talented Mr. Ripley on the big screen and feeling Incredibly disappointed, I turned to the novel to see if it was any better. The book sweeps you up in the twisted mind of Tom Ripley without all the politically correct apologies made for his charachter in the film. He doesn't kill out of self defense. He kills to move up in the world. He is clear calm and caluculating in the book. Compared to his easily flustered movie counter-part. There is an open ending to the book that suggest sequal (which I am now reading). The biggest joy about this book for me is its true to life statemets that Good doesn't always triumph and crime often does pay. Thank you Patricia. As for Hollywood please at least read the books you make movies from."
3,"Believe it or not, the movie was better...","I bought this book after seeing the movie and, I have to say, was actually disappointed. Very, very rarely do I find a movie to be better than the book it was based on but in this case I'll make an exception. The book starts with a bang but fizzles toward the end; it's nothing more than one ""hey, eluded them again"" chapter after another. Overall, it became repetitive and should have ended much sooner than it did."
2,The Unlikable Mr. Ripley,"'The Talented Mr. Ripley' is a well-written story with a completely unlikeable main character. I suppose the title is meant to reflect on Mr. Ripley's ability to con and exploit other people ... which, I guess, could be perceived as a talent. I was not amused or awed by his 'talent'. I found Mr. Ripley to be selfish, insensitive, cruel and insane. Highsmith is an excellent writer, but I failed to connect with her character. I like to be able to relate with and actually appreciate the characters I read about. There was absolutely nothing about Mr. Ripley that I found remotely likable or intriguing. He exploits others and kills them when they have outlived their use. With his victims silenced he goes on to live their lives by using their identities and money to move on to the next victim. No silver lining. No justice served. In book one, he simply walks away, free to ruin someone else's life."
4,It's a great book.,"This is an absolutely new story; there was no writer who wrote a comparable story. A lot of people have seen the movie with the same subject, but we propose them to read the book too. The book is better and more interesting than the movie. In Patricia Highsmith's book the characters of the persons are very well discript. P.H. invented a creature who's very talented and who could reach a lot in the real life. Sylvain and Marco"
4,A chilling glimpse,"I read this after seeing both the American and French movie versions, so my reading was colored, but certainly my enjoyment wasn't affected. Highsmith's style is incredibly captivating. Tom Ripley is sent to Europe to coax Dickie Greenleaf home. While there, Ripley becomes enamored with Dickie and his lifestyle, and in a passionate rage, Ripley kills him. Ripley begins living as Dickie, until the police begin circling closer to the truth, and Ripley uses every talent he has to elude them. The precursor to such books as Michael Pye's ""Taking Lives"", Highsmith's noir thriller is a fascinating character study of a man intent on changing the circumstances of his life at any cost."
3,"great characters,unbelievable plot","I did not see the movie, so I had no idea what to expect from the book. I heard it was a good suspense book....so I picked it up. You can definetly tell that it was written a while back and with a British flare,but I have to say that the suspense parts were rather predictable. I loved the characters,even the one's you weren't SUPPOSED to like and I think that was the best part about the book. You walk away feeling sorry for Tom and being totally annoyed with Dickie when it should be the other way around. In that aspect the writing was great. The suspense could use a boost but all in all it was a pretty interesting book. If you like Agatha Christie and some of the other authors of that time, you'll enjoy this book."
4,A new twist at every turn,"This is the first book of its kind that I have read. I was never really into crime novels, but when a woman gave me a box of books and I found this in the box, It looked good enough to read.You are grabbed right away, and taken into the crazy life of Tom Ripley, and finding that there is much more to him than you would expect at first. This is a fun, thrilling novel that will keep you on your toes.I deducted a star only because there are some chapters that just seemed to lag on. Highsmith did a great job of describing scenes in this book, but some of it went on a bit to long, and got boring. Other than this, it is a wonderful book.I can't wait to read the others in the series."
4,amazing,"The book is written very interesting, so that u almost can identify yourself at the beginning with tom. The caracters are well chosen. And I think also that the book is more interesting than the movie. In this book you can well see the improvement of his self-confidence which is very amazing to notice. All in all I have to say that this is one of the best books, we've ever read in our english-class."
5,The best murder mystery book out there.,This was an amazing book. Ripley was an intricate character that kept me entralled throughout the whole book. Sometimes you hated him and sometimes you felt sorry for him. A must read book.
3,Good but two dimensional at times,"I thought this book was good but found all but Dickie as characters rather two dimesional. The suspense in the book and the chances taken propelled me through but I found the movie and script by Anthony Minghella an improvement. Highsmith really didn't capture the pain as well that I thought Ripley might have and the restrained homosexuality didnt play out as well here as in the script by Minghella. I hate to say but the movie was bettr than the book. However, I do recommend Strangers on A Train by Highsmith."
2,James? Nabokov? Nah.,"Are Italy's police really the world's worst? Is Dickie's dad really that stupid? Is Marge really that naive? Who hires a detective who can't speak Italian to solve a murder in Italy? It's pretty hard to swallow.Not bad, but there's much more interesting stuff out there than this."
4,My Favorite Ripley,"This is my favorite in the ""Ripley"" series because the intricate plot is so tightly worked it is impossible to put down and after reading you must find another Ripley book to see what he is up to.The film version with Matt Damon is a case of perfect casting and an example of quality film making. This is a must read (the book) AND view (the movie).Never a dull moment when reading any of the Ripley books. If you like the Ripley books, you're sure to like her short stories, she is a master of psychological suspense."
1,Five stars? Really?,"I can't believe I am such a minority here. I have never been so bored or annoyed by a book. I did finish the book, though, sure something spectacular must be coming to somehow justify its publication. Several of the reviewers have complimented the story as subtle. I can only imagine they are only using ""subtle"" as a euphemism for ""boring."" Subtle it isn't: a summary: Tom Ripley is physically and mentally soft, weak, and afraid. Then Tom has a brief moment of unbelievable strength, cleverness, and drive. Then he takes a rest. Then repeat. The rest of the book may as well be a series of ditto marks. One review quotes the writer Hightower as saying about herself that her books are considered high literature by European critics. I assume this is Robert Blake-style self-promotion; if not, it is enough to encourage cultural ethnocentricity in the US."
2,Dated?,"I got about half way into the book then had to put it down. Tom Ripley is neither engaging, nor sympathetic, nor clever. Plus, with DNA evidence, the plot got lost on me."
2,Danny in the raw,"If you've got a yen to see Daniel Day-Lewis naked, this is worth your while. He has two nude scenes, one of them, er, lengthy and revealing (and some might say, risky--he's crawling out of a second floor window, naked in the rain). Otherwise, this is a surprising misfire, and a waste of a good cast."
3,A glimpse of an early Daniel Day-Lewis doing comedy,"Let me start by saying I think Daniel Day-Lewis if the finest actor living today. He is arguably the finest film actor ever. If you are a devoted fan, this is worth the money and effort to obtain. It is fascinating to see this in-control, always so exacting actor playing, there's no other word for it, goofy. He's manic and you can catch a glimpse of what a genius he could prove to be in a comedy. Just a glimpse, because the movie itself is horrendous. The main idea is good - a fish-out-of-water story about a New York/British art dealer sent to Georgia to obtain a rare painting - and there is a potential when it comes to the talent of the other cast members. But in the end it's not a very good movie."
5,good,"it was whta i want, completely sealed and new!! itis the second time i bought them, the cream it is excellent."
4,"Well done sensual, soft core opus","This series used to show on Toronto's late lamented ""Baby Blue Movie."" Most episodes were enjoyable in that the sex scenes were done tastefully and erotically, with sensual music by the unerotic-sounding Herman Beeftink. The young women involved were usually in admirable shape, and seeing them (again) is always a welcome sight"
1,AWFUL SOUND QUALITY,"The sound quality of this CD is truly AWFUL ... maybe the worst I have EVER heard. Amateurish. You could take old vinyl albums and record with a casette recorder in front of a speaker and do better. Anyone who heard these songs on a car radio in the 60's would be disappointed in this CD, and the Beach Boys would be insulted to think it is being foisted on the public. DON'T BUY IT unless you truly don't care what it sounds like."
5,memories,Love this album. Brings back a lot of fond memories. Received early with much delight. One of my husband's and my favorites. Received early.
3,"Great music, lousy platform","If I were just judging the music I'd give it five stars. Great selection and great price but....the cloud player I'm not happy with at all. I wanted to make a hard copy so that I could play it in my car but haven't been able to figure out how to do that. On iTunes it's so simple but here it will only allow me to play it on something with an internet connection. I do not want to use my smartphone to play music when I have a perfectly good CD player in my car. When I use my iPod there is no problem...music stored and ready to be played anytime.So, I'm a fan of the beach boys, and a big fan of Amazon but cloud drive is useless to me."
2,Beach Boy's Hits,I am living in Saudi Arabia and I was not able to download this CD into my Kindle! I don't know why because I was able to download books before.
2,Why Use The Mono Remixes?,"I guess that Capitol wanted to go the same route that Motown did and rerelease the mono sinlge mixes of the hits. Actually, in this band's case, this is not an improvement, even though Brian Wilson himself probably intended the recordings to be mono. The mono recordings are very muddy and one cannot hear the details of the songs as well as on the stereo versions. The CD booklet is somewhat improved and the songs have been restored to chronological order. This is a nice try, but it really does not add anything to existing catalog. Capitol faces a monumental task in restoring the Beach Boys back catalogue and I'm afraid that this CD was just treading water. Endless Summer has been deleted as well as most of the original albums."
1,Obsolete,"This was a good enough compilation in its day, but it has been replaced by the far superior Sounds of Summer collection, released in 2003. This CD only gives the listener 20 songs and has a downright meager running time of 49 minutes. SoS has 30 songs and runs for over 70 minutes. The only songs found here and not on SoS are ""409"" and ""Catch a Wave"".Add this to the fact that Sounds of Summer is frequently on sale, and there's no reason to go back to this outdated collection."
3,"Nice try, but try harder","Well, they tried. The remixing on some of the songs is horrible. It sounds like the mixer just started sliding the vocal volumes in and out. I had tried to get a cd copy of Endless Summer, but no luck. This is an ok substitute, but is disappointing. The Beach Boys and their music deserve a better effort."
5,It's givin me good vibrations...,"Just load it up into your jukebox or IPod. If you've never been to Cayucos, CA then you're hopelessly guessing at what these guys are talking about."
5,"It's so great I just wanna ""Dance, Dance, Dance!""","Even though I am only 14 years old, I still appreciate the Beach Boys' music. The song Kokomo takes me back to when I was 6 when I first heard it from the Muppets. Get this and the rest of the greatest hits albums. You won't regret it."
5,"'Cause you'll have fun, fun, fun!","Why doesn't everybody own this album?! This is the essential album of summer. My wife and I love to play this every year we go to the beach as it puts us in the perfect mood for sun and fun! This CD has it all: great surf hits (Surfin' Safari, Surfin' USA, Surfer Girl, Catch A Wave, etc.), classic girl songs (Barbara Ann, Help Me Rhonda, etc.), the greastest song of all time (Wouldn't It Be Nice - played this song at my wedding!), fun songs (Fun Fun Fun, Be True To Your School, California Girls), and even dance songs (Dance Dance Dance and Do You Wanna Dance?). Oh yeah, and I love the song ""God Only Knows."" And to top it all off, the album ends with the perfect ""Kokomo,"" which I believe was once voted the greatest summertime song of all time. Beach Boys hit their harmonies perfectly and are the rare band that is timeless and can also get you to close your eyes and escape to another place. This album is truly a masterpiece and is a must have for summer!"
3,I'm not a Beach Boy's fan...,"So I don't regularly listen to The Beach Boys, but since some of my friends(there's a group that hangs out a lot and we always listen to music) really likes them and I found the volume on sale, I decided to pick it up. We listened to it once, and never pulled it out again. I don't really remember exactly why we never took it out again, but we just didn't care for it."
5,A wonderfully remastered Hits album,"What? You don;t have any Beach Boy records? The shame of it all. Go out and buy this album. Other than the awesome Pet Sounds, this should be the only Beach Boy album you'll ever need to buy. It's a bargain to have all these classic party tunes on one CD. The first 19 tunes are all Sixties classics, then on the last song you jump ahead to 1988. But that's pretty much how long it was since the beach Boys were on the charts. This sampler is awesome. A must buy."
4,I almost missed the chance to get this great CD.....,"....because of some of the reviews here. I ordered this CD, then cancelled it after reading the reviews that debated whether stereo or mono is best, whether mono sounded 'muddy', or complained that one of their favorite songs was missing. What a fool (I was). Fortunately, I didn't cancel my order in time and received it anyway.I suggest ignoring any review that looks likes it was written by someone who has EVERY LP/CD done by the Beach Boys, and just buy this CD."
3,Kind Of Disappointed By This One,"When I picked this one up years ago I did so thinking I was getting the original hit single renditions of all 20 tracks. Only when I got it home, opened it, and pulled out the fold-out insert (which contains no liner notes whatsoever), did I find out that only tracks 1-3, 6,7, 9, 10, 12, and 14-17 were the hit single versions. The rest are either album cuts or alternate takes.The insert does provide a discography of the contents, but while it's a nice, clean compilation, it is still misleading in its title."
1,The Band Deserves Much Better Than This,"Another awkward collection from Capitol. The non-hit versions of ""School"" and ""Rhonda"" as well as sequencing that does not make any sense. The band made so much money for Capitol in the 60s and deserves a better collection than this. The whole catalogue is a shame. All of the twofer CDs are out of print. Most of the original albums are out of print, as well. This band deserves to be remembered for more than just Endless Summer and Pet Sounds. What remains of the Beach Boys' catalog is the tip of a very large iceberg of fine music."
4,A Very Good Singles Collection,"Contrary to some of the voiced complaints, the 1999 remastered version of this CD sounds wonderful. There are no problems with the endings of Help Me Rhonda and Fun, Fun, Fun. These may have been problems on the 1995 version but not on this disc. Worth noting is that 19 of the 20 selections are in the original mono single versions(the exception being Kokomo). This is clearly stated on the back of the CD. As far as content, when Capitol issued this in 1995, it was not Volume 1. It was just meant to be The Beach Boys 20 Greatest hits(in Capitol's opinion). The follow up Volumes add the rest of the best. If you hate mono, skip this disc;if not you'll love it."
2,Dil Se,"Bought this CD, but cannot play it in my car. Only on pc. Cannot even add it to my list of music. Pity."
2,Overpaid,"The CD does not have all the songs that were sung in the movie. The CD case had to be thrown away as the inlay was incorrectly manufactured and it was not holding the CD in place.The CD itself is an indian originating CD which costs only INR125 !! that is less than 50% what I was charged for. If I knew I would be buying an CD for the price of INR125, I would have gone to the Indian grocery store and buy a cheap copy for 2$"
4,One of the most unique voices in pop music,"I have to say I knew this album was out awhile before I bought it . . . cautiously. I really despised Sommerville's ultra-dull VH-1 on Nembutol last disc, but there's just no other voice like his, and I read good reviews of Manage the Damage, so I got it. Happily, it's made me entirely forget his last dud. This album is controlled and well-thought-out musically. Only one song is a bit overly-preachy (about physical abuse), but that's the only irritation (a lyrical one; the song sounds nice). The opening track reminds me of a catchier version of the song he recorded for the film Orlando--vaguely operatic/house/orientalist--very cool, and my favorite track on the disc. But what I like just as much as Sommerville's voice is that this album has the sound of something that won't grow immediately stale, and it's great finding a CD I can listen to all the way through without skipping tracks. Glad I bought it."
4,"Simon & Simon, Season # 3","with the exception of 2 or 3 Microscopic Defects burned onto the DVD's, I thought that it is pretty good."
2,Packaging heads up,This is a heads-up about a potential flaw in packaging. On the set that I received from Amazon every disk had a filmy layer on it that was sufficient to interfere with playing. The disks cleaned up and are playing fine but the film soon returned. I think it is the cheap cases provided. They are leaching plastic material of some kind onto the disks themselves. I guess I can keep cleaning them but why would such skanky packaging be used in the first place? Shame on whoever is responsible.
3,Dvd's Horribly Dirty and Burnt but work for now,I recently purchased Simon and Simon Season Three New from Amazon. The Dvd's were horribly dirty and burnt. They play fine for now but I don't anticipate them to last very long. I won't play them on my computer for fear they will damage it. I was really excited about getting this great 80's show on Dvd. Be careful when ordering anything through Amazon Manufactured from Shout.
1,deservedly out of print,"Once again we hear about the brave and pious Spanish missionaries seeking to make the savage California natives ""rational"" while increasing their industry and saving their souls. Anyone who still can't see this for the hopelessly imperialistic and brutal enterprise it really was (and incidentally, most of the Baja natives are now extinct) might find this book enjoyable Sunday school reading."
1,bottom line- NOT funny,"I was looking for good comedy and thought "" Mike Myers, Andy Richter, Andy Dick"" don't think I can go wrong with this one. Well, I did. It was very boring. Maybe 5 minutes of funny and two chuckles in the whole thing. Having watched plenty of ""Who's line"" with it's semi-improv stuff and always laughing, I guess I was expecting too much. Don't waste your time or money on this one if what you want is real entertainment."
2,If you have to choose...,"This DVD wasnt as enjoyable as I thought it would be, throwing a lot of people together who dont normally work together was bad. If you have to choose between this DVD and ASSSSCAT! then go with asssscat. I think the shining stars of this DVD were the UCB guys and with asssscat you get all of them all the time. Ill admit that Im biased because Im with UCB but we have a lot of respect for IO and they are the only school we let cross over into UCB for classes. Like I said if you are going to choose go with asssscat, the commentary is also great for small little tips in asssscat. This wasnt terrible but it was a let down."
3,huge book,"very happy to have gotten the next 3 novels but book is too large to hold and lettering a bit small for me. next time will order 1 at a time. whenever I have to go to the doctor's office, I will not be taking that hugh book with me, but lucas is the best detective that I have read."
2,Opportunistic writing,"It is very obvious from the first chapters that Cruver wrote this book to cash in on the Enron story. He would most likely not deny it since he relates himself how he tried to sell internal company-wide emails on e-bay, but just don't buy this book thinking you'll learn the underworld of Enron, or any new information at all.As another reader mentioned, he joined Enron during its last year of existence, and not in a key position within the company. Although he does a good job at displaying the corporate attitude of Enronians, he's not sheding any new lights on the subject. The book is mostly descriptive, not explanatory: there is no real analysis about what went wrong.The audio CDs made my commute more exciting, but you could learn more about Enron in one WSJ article."
2,Very junior writer - knows almost nothing,"The author was on his second year after graduating from MBA program, when he spent 9 (I got this from another review) months at Enron. Sadly, he would know nothing for a fact of what was going on at the top of the company. Good news, he does not really hide this fact. Bad news, the book is just that: what would it be like to be at Enron during the last days, when you are a junior guy. I think this has value to some readers, hence 2 stars. Just don't look for any analysis or explanations or insights, and you would be fine reading it. There is some over-reaching in the book, when the author tries to convey that he knows more than he really does. But for the most part you get the right impression: it's the bystander saying ""holly cow!""."
2,Anatomy of Greed,"As a former Enron employee, I was excited to hear that an insider was about to proclaim the truth about what went on inside Enron. Unfortunately, this book misses the mark--by no fault of his own but because he simply was not with the company long enough (9 months). By the time Cruver arrived at Enron, the wheels on the wagon were already falling off. Cruver was not a Trader but a marketing specialist / product developer which is very different. I'm still waiting for The Book, one written by a real insider. Although well written, it is more filler than substance (e.g. the Cow Parade) and by the way Skilling didn't quit because of Teeside."
2,Memoirs of a Carpetbagger,"Only published because it was first on the scene; given the author was an apparently unemployed junior credit-derivatives salesman (who had worked at Enron for just a few months before it went bankrutp, and who continued to receive paychecks for not showing up for some time thereafter) at the time, it's not too surprising he had the time to jump right on writing it. Kudos to him for exploiting the opening, but there's not much of value here, and the book is marred by the author's racism and sexism. The made-for-TV movie is actually better than the book, which says it all."
4,A pleasent reading,"At the beginning, I was wondering what can the insider opinion be and what he can share with us. I was really surprised to see that it is readable and enjoyable. I read it really fast and found the information very interesting. Though I lacked the accounting gimmicks which were used, I like the overall picture and descriptions of the main characters and the plot itself."
3,A good read but no analysis,A good 'first hand' account but it goes nowhere near a serious analysis of what was going on at Enron. It is also a bit to 'frat house' for me - but as I said it is supposed to be a 'first hand' account of a the ordinary worker in Enron and it has achieved that.
1,Great satire or inept reporting?,"It is difficult to tell whether the author is presenting himself as a personification of the organization or really feels that he is helping readers understand the events during Enron's downfall.If you want to gain insight to the Enron mistakes, do not waste your time on this book. If you want a light laugh at the human values that destroyed the organization, the author's self-centered account will be helpful."
3,"Mediocre acting, but original and daring","Fourteen year old Thomas (Raphael Sbarge) is brutally abused by his parents but manages to find comfort in associating with a gay film director who is making a documentary on physical child abuse. As the relationship deepens, the two falling in love, the elder is forced to make a decision: runaway with Thomas or focus on his career and let the boy possibly be beaten to death. This somewhat B-ish film suffers from mediocre acting but is certainly original and daring."
4,Great towel,"I bought two of these for my newborn. Each towel is huge and both are still going strong after being washed at least once per week each for the past 5+ months. They were extremely absorbent and soft initially. The reason I took one star off is that they seem a little less soft and absorbent than initially but just mildly so. not sure if it's the detergent but I have only laundered with ivory snow or purex baby liquid. another plus, the gingham print has hardly faded at all which was a concern of mine prior to purchasing and receiving the towels.All in all a good buy, much better than the run of the mill pretty but not very absorbent baby towels."
2,Definitely teaches the basics,"My husand and I purchased this DVD to sharpen our dance skills. It was extremely basic, so if that's what you are looking for then this is for you. The DVD was NOT new. The steps were extremely basic and they teach you without music. It moved along very slow, so my husband lost interest and we quit practicing with it. It was not all that we had hoped for."
3,Disappointed,"I suppose these blades would come in handy for cutting very small branches and soft wood, but they just didn't hold up to pruning my oak trees. I went through several blades over the course of a year. They also tend to bend pretty easily with harder woods. They worked slightly better on my shrubbery. It was better than sawing everything by hand like I had done in the past, but still took a lot of time to get through the wood. Don't expect a lot from this purchase."
1,Forever shipping,"Took forever to get here. Almost two weeks....!!! Other than that, it was in fine shape and exactly what I ordered."
4,An easy read for those new to poetry.....,"One Hundred and One Famous Poems is a really good poetry book. I don't usually like poems that much, let alone reading, but I found at least 27 poems I liked. Some of the poems I really enjoyed were Whitman's ""O"" Captain my Captain, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The Builders, Eugene Field's The Duel and Edmund Vance Cooke's How did you die?This book is an easy read and you may discover that you really enjoy poetry if you haven't read much poetry before. I read the book in five days, and that's not easy when you have ADD as bad as I do. The book is only one hundred and ninety-two pages and has large print making it easier to read. I thought the book was similar in some ways to Stephen King's book Night Shift; it's like a bunch of short stories except these are poems although I can't say I have ever read a poem that was six pages long until now."
5,Great selection!,Reading keeps me inspired and this book gives the some great collection of poems. The author did a great job in getting the best ones. Highly recommended!
3,not leather bound- but library bound!,"the one I got was library bound instead of leather bound, but still a great book with a wonderful variety of poems."
4,Pretty good,"Good plot, but a bit slow-moving. You don't actually get into the part about The Maid until over halfway through. Great ending though, and I really liked the characters. One complaint is that the glossary is very incomplete. It defines all the obvious Scottish words (aye=yes, isnae=is not) but not many of the more obscure ones. Whenever I came to a word I *had* to look up to know the meaning, it wasn't there. This doesn't really take away from the story itself, though. Zohariel@hotmail.com"
5,A captivating tale full of fantasy and witchcraft,"This is the story of Meg- a thirteen year old girl growing up in the thirteenth century. She'll take you through all of her adventures on the high seas. I would reccommend Quest for a Maid to anyone who enjoys adventure, fantasy, and witchcraft."
4,Not that bad,"I think the book wasn't the greatest ever written, but itcertainly wasn't a waste to read. It was a bit slow in getting to theactualy quest for the maid, but i did enjoy some of the things Meg got herself into. The vocab was hard to get used to, and many words i went to look up in the glossary and found weren't there, and other words i saw in the glossary i don't even think were in the story! but whatever, it was ok."
5,Everything You Wanted to Know about Wills,"When I've gone to lawyers to have paperwork done such as wills, I've had the idea that they have a standard form in their word processing system. First they talk to you (at $100+ per hour) and ask you a bunch of questions. I think your answers are used to fill in the blanks in their word processing system.Now there are computer programs like this one that take a particular area of the law and produce the forms you need. This one is obviously oriented to wills (duh, look at the name), it includes legal wills, living trusts, health care directives (living wills) powers of attorney, final arrangements documents, and forms for executors. Because it is a commercial product, it has been produced to the highest possible standards (for fear of law suits).Note: Do not use this product in Louisiana which bases its legal system on the Napoleanic code rather than English Common Law."
2,disappointed,"The song selection looked good and the actual performance probably was good, but you can't tell it from this CD. The speed of the recording is off: too fast. If this were a cassette tape instead of a CD I probably would have thought the physical mechanism defective. I have not listened to it much because the high pitch is annoying on most songs. I have probably overrated it giving two stars but it got one just for being a Dead recording I had not seen. This is not worth paying a premium price. Buy any other Dead I have ever heard first."
1,Stay Away,"This is the worst quality recording I have ever heard, and that is including any of the 100+ Dead shows I have on tapes and cds. It sounds like they were playing through a telephone or something. This cd should not be on the market and is far worst quality then even those shows that aren't released from the same time. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!!!!"
4,One of the best!!!!,"When i bought ""Trouble ahead,..."", i thought: ""What a boring cover, this could not be good!"" but when i listened to it, I thought, this is one of the the Dead's best! I've never heard such a powerful 'Not fade away', The solo at the end of 'Morning DEW' is marvelous, there's no other CD with such a energetic SOLO! Pigpen is at his best at 'Good Lovin' and 'King Bee' and 'Casey Jones' is sooo damn pretty at the End of the Disc! It's like i wrote, one of the Dead's best! The only boring thing on this CD is, that the sound-quality is not always good!"
5,Focuses especially upon the past 100 years,"Now in an updated and expanded second edition, The Dancing Chain is the in-depth story of the history and development of the Derailleur Bicycle. The Dancing Chain offers the culmination of 10 years of research - 5 poured into the first edition, and now another 5 into the second, and focuses especially upon the past 100 years. Black-and-white photographs and illustrations reveal how bicycles adapted to the challenges of traveling faster on level ground and climbing better uphill. The Dancing Chain does not shy from technical detail, yet remains informatively accessible to the lay reader making it a fascinating resource for leisure reading, as well as hard research for academia. Highly recommended for bicycle enthusiasts and historians alike."
2,Must be industrial sabotage...,"No reputable company could possibly have offered a product of such inferior quality and intended to live by its reputation! On the second use, the plastic/aluminum clasp came apart and could not be fixed. The strap itself with its plastic adjustment is certainly worth far less than the $10.00 that I paid. It definitely should be padded, and I did not find it particularly effective in holding the trimmer at an appropriate angle. Wish I had read the other reviews before making my purchase!"
1,No Way,"I'm pretty sure I received this same strap FREE with an earlier Pyobi Stringtrimmer and after using it once, it hasn't been used again. It needs to have some padding (it doesn't), should be easily adjustable (so so), and should be included free with all newer 4-stroke trimmers due to their increased weight (they aren't). I just was just not very impressed the quality of this accessory."
1,I can't imagine paying for this...,"Well, mine was included with my 875. The clasp bent open the first time I picked it up. After dealing with that for a while, I just tied it on. So let's just say you'll probably want a shoulder strap, but use any old thing you've got lying around before paying real money for this. It must be embarrassing working for Ryobi."
1,Worthless,It was hard to attach and then not comfortable. I eventually threw the strap away and just carry the trimmer (which I love). Don't waste your money.
2,Barely Adequate,"I have a strap from a previous Ryobi and found it marginal at best and eventually decided not to work with it. It did not adjust easily and was unpadded. As good as Ryobi is at designing value into its products, you'd think they would get the strap right. Frankly, I think it should be free with all stringtrimmers that they offer. Should I choose to purchase the Ryobi 825r, I may look around for an aftermarket replacement for the strap I have, since the 4-stroke 825r is reputed to be a little heavier than the 2-stroke I already have. So Ryobi...are you willing to risk losing a potential customer for your normally excellent products by producing (and including free) an optional but chinzy accessory?"
2,Better than nothing,"If you use your trimmer more than ten minutes at a time (not including the ten minutes you spent starting it), you may find this strap helpful. Once I had it adjusted, I found it took a lot of strain off of my right arm. My model came with a newer clip and is as flimsy as anything. After one season of weekly use the clip bent open."
2,Look Elsewhere,"My strap came with my Ryobi, and is not designed well. The clasping mechanism is simply not strong enough. The clasp seems to be made of aluminum, and bends when any pressure is placed against it. I find that a strap is useful in order to get leverage in cutting tree limbs, but avoid this one... it just is not of any quality."
2,Not Impressed With Shoulder Strap,"The shoulder strap does not help much and seems to get in the way. It is always falling off my shoulder. It would have been nice if they designed a pad to fit a persons shoulder, like laptop cases have. I finally removed it."
3,Midnight Marauders II....?,Not quite...But still a good album. I like the production on this especially the track with 9th wonder. The Jam remix made me cop this album but Mind Power is my fav. track now. Good stuff if you want more of that Tribe feel. ATCQ Forever!
5,maximizing your potential,"A dee-lightful (with an extra ""e"" for the extra delight) book, skillfully written to show how unaware we can be of our potential and what it takes to unlock and nuture it."
4,outstanding insight,"This book is brilliantly written, even a child could understand it. Actually i bought two copies so that i could lend one out to friends. I think you will enjoy it and perhaps re-read it just so that you can get the full benefit of it. It will not only challenge you but will give you encouragement too."
1,Total dissapointment.,"Item appears larger in picture than it actually is. I tried to return it only to find out all items from this vendor are final sale. This info. was conveniently left out while I was making the purchase, otherwise I would not have bought it.Now I am stuck with an item I don't need or want. I will never again buy anything from this website or any of its vendors."
5,Facsimile Reprint,"The edition of _The Sacred Harp_ being offered here is a facsimile reprint of an old edition - c. 1859 - similar to the Broadman Press facsimile edition (out of print). The 1991 Edition of _The Sacred Harp_ and the ""Cooper Book"" Edition are both widely used at singings today. Do an internet search for current information on Sacred Harp Singing."
4,A piece of history,"The Sacred Harp, a compilation of hymns and songs written in shaped notes, was put together for congregational singing by Benjamin Franklin White, the brother of my great, great, great grandmother. It is still used today throughout the South wherever there are gatherings for ""Singing School.""The concept of teaching shaped notes helped many people learn singing in the days when musical instruments were rare and choral singing was an art highly valued."
4,Does NOT include the 'Erasure Head'promo on the 'Cost of Living' EP,I was disappointed that the 'Erasure Head' promo was omitted from the end of the 'Cost of Living' EP.
5,Complete Control (of Your Clash Singles),"Now together in one handy box, with great art, lots of bonus tracks... a collector's eargasm of crucial punk rock. The only thing that should keep you from buying this is that it's a bit costly. But if you're a true Clash fan you must get it. Try not to think about the crass commercialism of it--try to picture it as ""the guys in the band finally get their due."" Do it for Strummer's kids!"
3,the Clash-singles,i was very disappointed that alot of the Magnificent Seven have been left off...i bought it specifically for that song. but other than that it's a good cd.
5,Wonderful,I chose this rating because The Singles is more than I expected. It should be a must for all fans of The Clash.
4,"Fun, but not compatible with other sets","I like this set for my daughter, but buyer beware-- this is not compatible with either the wooden or the other plastic sets sold in the Thomas line. None of the other stores in our area sell anything compatible with this system. I also got a good deal on this set at Toys R Us at holiday time."
5,Rock!,I bought this CD back in the day from the used CD bin. It's one of the only albums I actually look for and listen to in it's entirety.
2,Cheap but you get what you paid for,"The review by Warhawke is spot on and I am 100% in agreement.The wood and the paint are subpar at best and they do not fit together well. It took a great deal of effort to make the top panel in place, and I honestly thought it might have broken while I was trying to piece it together.I was also very disappointed by the paint quality. Immediately you will notice the painted wood feels uncomfortable and gritty and has no gloss or shine whatsoever. I recommend purchasing some polyurethane from home depot for $2 and applying a coat to the frame.Overall considering the price it gets the job done."
2,Read the legal disclaimer,"in the description again. When I ordered this ib Jan. 09, they had a pretty little picture making it look ""wholesome."" The box that arrived is colored white rock ""candy"" (their words)and definately not from Europe. I was looking for a non-refined product. Euro grocer lost this customer.Edit to add that when I posted this review it was called ""sugar"" not candy. I was seeking the gourmet sugar crystals that are served by high end caterers.edit 2012 - When I purchased this - it was sold by another seller and was advertised as natural sugar. I see that this seller is upfront about what the item is and commend them for it."
2,confused and really poor packaging,"As another reviewer commented, I was also confused about what this product was. It is described as ""rock candy sugar."" Well- is it sugar or is it candy?? I was also looking for a non-refined substitute for the sugar the high end tea stores sell. It is described as a substitute for sugar, so I thought it was the same. I received it in the mail today. It looks the same but is not as hard as the high end stuff I purchased. I am not sure what this means and am still not sure if this is the same thing. It came very poorly packaged in a flimsy box with the crystals leaking out everywhere. All they had to do was put it in a bag inside the box to remedy that. Not sure I will purchase again because I don't really know what I got."
1,boring boring boring,"I got this DVD and thought I give it a try. It is not only extremely basic information but horribly created. The author talks as if you are in slow slow slowwwwwwwwww motion. takes forever to say a phrase. could not even finish it.I understand this might have been done to address customers who have no or little knowledge of ebay, but the slow motion in which is done, goes to a level of customers who can not comprehend even basic english language. Would not view it even for free. Terrible tutorial."
1,Ryobi never again,"The only good thing to say about the Ryobi, is that the name is easy to spell. The product right out of the box did not operate correctly. When attempting to pull start the unit, there was a hard spot that preventing me from pulling the chord all the way at times. When you managed to get around this, the unit still did not want to start.Called customer service at Ryobi, was disconnected, disconnected while waiting, and finally waiting on hold for 25 minutes I was able to speak to a representative.All he told me, was if you bought it through Amazon, you could not return the unit. I should have gone to a Lowes and than I could have exchanged it.The planting season is right now and I have to wait three weeks for a dealership to get to it and who is to say that it will run correctly than.Do not buy Ryobi!"
1,Would not start,"I could not get it to start after the first time. Service center recommended that I return it and get a 2-cycle model instead. They said that the 2-cycle models have been far more reliable, and spare parts much cheaper."
3,Great When It Starts,"Unpacked the tiller and started it according to instructions. All worked well the first few times I test started it. Later that day when ready to work in the garden, I tried to start it again and the recoil starting mechanism appeared to be defective. Some of the time the cord would pull free and not spin the motor. Other times, it was as if the compression wouldn't release and the rope wouldn't pull. Contacted customer service and found that the nearest service center was one-half hour drive away - Ryobi needs more service locations! After a two week wait for repair (and many long distance calls to check on progress), the service center said that after disassembly, lubing and reassembly, the unit starts fine. We'll see..."
4,"Smooth operation, but be sure to tighten all the fasteners","I ordered this on 3/26 and it arrived 4/4. Very good with the free shipping! Asssembly took only 20 minutes and the instructions were specific, although written for several different models. I ran the engine with no load for a few minutes, rev'ing up and down, then got to work. The tiller was easy to run in compacted garden soil and chopped up the spring weeds with no problem. I tilled an area about 25'x10' in 30 minutes and the area is now ready to rake and seed. Two passes are required to get to the max depth but the machine is so light that the second pass pulling backwards is not difficult but do watch for obstacles behind you. The only minus is the wheel assembly wingnuts (off to the hdwe store to get several sets) as they loosened with the vibration. Wear ear protection!!!"
1,Not a good buy,"The ryobi 510R 4-cycle yard & Garden Cultivator did not work for me. I started the tiller and it ran for about 5 minutes and it locked up and would not run. The local authorized service dealer repaired it but it took over a month to get parts.Then I tried it again and it ran maybe 10 minutes this time before it locked up again,same as before.Now its in the shop again and the dealer says he ordered the parts 3 months ago and has not receive the parts as of today.So I don't rate this tiller at all.You have heard about the LEMON, well I got one. the number to contact Ryobi is a joke,you never talk to anyone before they disconnect."
4,2 cents,"For those who would like a pocket size new testament bible that is a bit classier than most. It has a leather-like look, gold edging, and a red ribbon marker. Sometimes the red-letter is off slightly from the black lettering, but generally, its what you need to carry anywhere you go. It litterally fits in any pocket. I've found myself pulling it out while walking or during prayer times.It does not include proverbs, unfortunately. I wouldn't call it a children's bible either, though it is advertised as one."
2,Not what was advertised,"This New Testament was advertised as being leather bound. But instead, it was bonded leather. It would have been best for it to have been advertised for what it actually was."
4,Slightly Disappointing,"I love the simple patterns but the cost of the yarns recommended is really high. I know you can substitute yarns, but it's still quite expensive. Also, I wish there had been more sweaters on larger needles."
5,Essential. In 50 years it hasn't gotten any better than this,...this is essential stuff.some of the finest electric blues ever from the father ofelectric blues guitar...
1,Horribly disappointing...,"An awful end to a story about heroism and strength in the face of adversity. While Shandril has increased in power, Narm has not (why?) and is more useless than ever. He reminds me of the typical 'helpless female' character so prevalent in books and movies.This book seems like an exercise in writing combat scenes, as Shandril kills all those who oppose her, over and over and over again. In addition, it makes little sense that various allies of Shandril and Narm have the ability to magically travel but never share that with them, forcing them to walk and ride while coming under almost constant attack. It's almost like Ed hate's Shandril's character, and is torturing her."
1,What was the author thinking?,"I loved the first two books in this series. Spellfire and Crown of Fire managed to capture a sense of both humor and desperation.Not only does Hand of Fire lack the humor of the first two books, it's the single most depressing novel I have ever read. Now, I don't mind a tragic ending, I'm very fond of dark stories, but this ending was far too dark even for me. Narm and Shandril don't managed to accomplish anything, and then Shandril dies uselessly at the end.Do not waste money buying this book. You will only end up angry about buying it."
1,Disappointing end to a promising trilogy,"If you enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy, stop there. Unfortunately, Hand of Fire is a great disappointment. This book will leave you with the feeling of being cheated. The first two installments made this conculsion look very promising. Ed Greenwood had the chance to get Shandril and Narm to their goal and accomplish something. By the end of this book I felt like I just ran around in circles, winding up where I started and feeling dizzy. It would have been better if he just stopped with Crown of Fire and left the story open-ended instead of way he chose to end it."
1,Dont know what to say...,"Without reading the other reviews, I can say that this book is rambling and pointless. Characters are introduced mindlessly without any thought to advance the plot (if you could even say there is a plot!), and the author doesnt seem able to continue with a single line of thought for more than about two pages.While the other two books in the series are at least readable, reading this one was agony, even for a hard core Forgotten Realms fan like myself. Do yourself a favor and get a different FR book."
1,"Poorly Written, No flow, Bad Ending","I have to say, I loved this series of books, until the last book. I loved the first novel especially, and I would read it over and over. The same things applies to the second. I hated the third. The entire novel felt rough. There was no flow to it, and in fact there was the pointless death of Shandril. There is the whole message of no one will leave her alone, but there are places that Greenwood himself created that she could live out her life. It was a senseless killing and one that ruined the entire series for me. I read these books in high school (8ish years ago) and once I read this final novel, I never touched them again."
1,Don't waste your time reading this,"When Elminster sent Shandril off to reach Silverymoon ON FOOT AND WITH NO HELP, I thought there was some clever scheme to lure and despatch all the bad guys in the land i.e. use Shandril as bait. But no, Elminster didn't have a plan on how things would go, and neither did Ed Greenwood, by the looks of it.Most stories with bad endings are poignant and meaningful, but this book just had a bad ending because Greenwood didn't know what else to do by the looks of it. There's nothing meaningful and it was such a waste of time."
1,Throw this story into the fire,"I like forgotten realms books in general so its funny that the one author I typically don't like is Ed Greenwood. The dialogue of the characters is generally silly. The fight scenes are so obscure they are barely understandble.I read the first two books and generally didn't like them. For some reason, I decided to finish out the trilogy. Needless to say I couldn't finish the book. I was too bored, so I went to the next RA Salvatore book."
1,Oh please,"Look, I have tripped and stumbled painfully through three of Greenwood's books and I honestly can't see why people purchase them. To be candid they are bad plain and simple. He is an enigma in that he is a terrible writer and doesn't sell very well versus his peers and yet still he is hyped and touted. It is ONLY because he created the original d&d universe that he is given the courtesy of publishing garbage. If you don't believe me and think he is a good writer try a superior Forgotten Realms author, like Troy Denning. DON'T BE FOOLED."
3,Lightweight Pop,"Ayers' latest album Unfairground was wonderful, a real return to his form, and so I though this might show similar inspiration. It feels too low key and dated -- after a handful of plays not much stands out."
2,Long Editorial,"I generally enjoy Bonner's material, but I found that this book did not contain a solid factual basis, but rather a long editorial on Bill's views. In addition, it was rather repetitious; once the first chapter is complete, there is no need to read the rest of the book."
2,Inflation: The blessed blight of capitalism,"If you liked the movie Independence Day, then by all means read ""Empire of Debt."" If you believe in free enterprise, then save your money.Financial ruin is not around the corner like the book claims. Inflation is. Inherent to capitalism this economic phenomenom will balance our trade deficit, pay old debts with devaluated currency, revive the real estate market and so forth. Double digit inflation is upon us. Thirty years is about the right time for it to flare up again. Get your bucks from under the mattress and act accordingly.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir."
5,Your freedom is lost; your future could be also.,"While the authors may tend to hyperbole at times I found it well researched and written with some humerous and outstanding metaphors. It is a sad commentary, though, on the decline of the American republic to the entitlement-minded welfare state that the voters have actively sought. It is not a matter of 'if', but 'when'? Buy gold."
3,A dinner table knife won't win you a battle,"It was an interesting read, got a lot of good points and good stories, but the authors basically:use common sense to refute mainstream economics,use data to fight neocon politics,use history to combat empire sociology,and ultimately fell into the same old trap:a lot of talks, no analytical thinking;a lot of information, no framework;a lot of history, no theory...A dinner table knife won't win you a battle, let alone when you see it as a war."
2,"not a real history, nor economics book",This book has some good info and some that is inaccurate.For example the part about English poor laws is inaccurate.Books that claim to be describing history should at least be fact-checked.Worth reading but don't believe all without verifying.
3,doom and gloom view with a historical perspective,"Unlike other doom and gloom books on American economy including ""the Demise of the dollar"",""The Collapse of the Dollar and How to Profit from It"", ""The Bust Ahead"", or ""America's Financial Apocalypse"", this book provides more indepth analysis and commentary about American economy, consumerism culture, and politics from a historical perspective. It's a 384 pages book, if you have plenty time and enjoy reading about economy and history like myself, you will enjoy this well researched and written book.There's no specific investment advice in this volume, but you do find gems and wisdoms about investing here and there. The major theme and idea of this book are succinctly summarized in much less pages in the newly released book and documentary/DVD ""I.O.U.S.A."""
5,Excellent well written book,"If you are concerned with the debt of this country it will enlighten you, it is a must read"
1,Irreverent View of America,"The authors of this book are anxious to describe the follies and pure idiocy of our American History. It is pursued with an almost zealous irreverence. What are the solutions....the actions.... that politicians should take? If politicians listened to the authors in this book, then Presidents would do nothing but stand aside, and allow the world to take its own path.The authors actually expose themselves by asking, ""If democracy was such a good idea, why did people put up with other forms of government for so many hundreds of years?""This comment, among others, reveals their disdain not just for America, but for democracy in general. These pious economists exercise their democratic freedoms on a daily basis. These very freedoms would not be available for them to abuse if our forefathers had actually believed this type of nonsense."
1,Empire of Debt,"Very dull and boring. Mostly, 90%, is a history lesson of past empires. I would only recommend it to students who are economic majors. Can I have my money back!"
2,Relative to what?,"The writing was eloquent with a entertaining mix of sarcasim. The history lessons were appreciated. Most readers that chose to purchase this book know that the overuse of debt by the US is a long term problem/concern for the world. Buying gold to address these concerns is not constructive nor sensitve to the dynamics of world economics. I read this recommendation in 1980 by other sensational writers and would have endured miserable inflation adjusted performance if I had bought gold. Even at $1000/oz.in 2006, I would not have realized the performance of the S&P; or the Euro equivalent.Economics is a dynamic dismal science that has an ebb and flow. The US in not alone in its deficit spending practices. I wanted a better feel for the international dynamics of negative balance of payments; to understand how the deficit spending of most nations impacts the long term value of $US.I guess I bought the wrong book. But still appreciated the writer's sense of humor."
3,Good Insight and good history lesson,"The book repeats itself a lot. That maybe because the authors are trying to drive home a point. If I met these guys in public I would probably not listen to them due to thier arrogance. However, since I am just reading, they do offer great insight and an excellant history lesson. As a former banker, I have seen first hand the tides of lending change and I also was worried about it. Without all the name calling, obviously an attempt at humor, this book would have received at least a 4 star. I do believe every politician should read this and have one thrown in thier casket when they die so to haunt them in purgatory."
4,www.sportofdistraction.com,"Bonner & Wiggin provide a worthwhile service by pointing out the depletion of the meaning behind certain political labels (whether they have done so intentionally, or not). The time for the electorate to put aside political affiliation, and take-up a comprehensive understanding of the issues is upon us.Too many elected officials hide behind the label, and conduct themselves in a contradictory manner, and it's harmful to us all. That's SOME of what I took from this work, which is a perspective that may not be addressed in other reviews.Additionally, the borrowing ways that have brought us to this point must be revised and replaced with actual conservatism, as opposed to the current brand."
5,A must read for 2005,"What an extraordinary read. This book is so well written with wit and humor, but is also so truthfully refreshing in its reality and views of America as an empire.Not only is this book so well written, but Bonner and Wiggins surpassed my expectations for a reality based, factual book on the very subject that others are trying to deny. It was well researched and based with solid facts from our own American history.They give forthright, candid and sincere views about how we, as Americans, have become freely unsatisfied to the point of destruction.I commend the authors for such a knowledgeably written book on a subject others only try to skim over, wanting to believe that it is not occurring when the truth lies before them.I recommend this book, not only to those with a genuine interest in politics or the financial state of our country, etc., etc., but also to those who want a blunt, sincere and honest view of the empire we, as Americans, have built."
4,Scary and believable,"I do think that the authors are generally right about the situation--that we are trying to create an empire out of our debts (as in, we owe so much that the world--or our bankers--will keep lending to us), and that in the long run this will not extend our empire into, say, the next century.But an internet friend reported that listening to the authors' recommendations some years back cost him a good chunk of his retirement nest egg.In other words, based on his experience, I'm not sure their ideas on how an individual should react to the problem are going to work--a least in any time line we are likely to be using."
3,Accurate predictions. Poor delivery.,"I appreciate that the authors were trying to sound the alarm bell on an impending financial disaster but the manner in which they delivered their message was disappointing. It is unfortunate that such a valuable message about the financial health of the US was delivered in such a poor way.In what seems to be an attempt to convince the reader that they are highly educated intellectuals, the authors repeatedly choose to hammer home their points by using obscure, high-brow hyperbolic metaphors punctuated by scores of 10 cent words. One could forgive a few of these occurrences but unfortunately the book is filled with them and it detracts from an otherwise valuable message."
3,Truth surrounded by liberal mantra,"Mr Bonner sets forth an interesting premise about the ""Empire"" but I felt I was in the college class of a very angry professor condemning most US history and ignoring what has made America great. The ""Empire"" thought is compelling but in my opinion the author does not explain the underlying cause for the present debt situation."
4,Pretty decent tutorial,This cd first gives a kind of quiz to test your knowledge of digital cams. Its really helpful for newbies since it has a really good and organized tutorial.You dont have to keep looking and reading since the characters actually dictate the tutorial.There are two kinds of installations available and the compact one only takes 3mb!Recommended!
3,Very basic information.....,"I got this for my parents and their new digital camera. Since they were new to the world of digital cameras, they found the program helpful and constantly referred to it.The information provided is very basic, but in an easy-to-use format and includes some basic tools.If you've read your camera manual and visited a few web sites to learn about your purchase and STILL have some questions, I suggest you try this software."
2,Not good quality,This costume is cute but the quality is poor. I had to take black marker to several white spots on the black stripes and portions of the writing to make it complete.
1,Rip off!!!!!,I find it offensive that these DVD's are being sold for $9.95 per 30 min. episode! Our tax dolrs paid for the full production and airing of this wonderful series. To charge so much is simply shameful!
5,Excellent book!,"I'm an avid reader and this was one of the best written books I'v read in years. I hated to put it down. I hope that Freddie Lee continues to write. Bittersweet was a breath of fresh air in an era when I feel that books by African-American writers are being ""whipped"" together so fast and most of them are pure junk! This book was worth more than 5 stars!"
4,Preachy but interesting,"Originally when I read the summary of this book, I wanted to read it because I have never read a book from a father's perspective on divorce, child support, and women. But Nathan's character started blinking red lights in my head because I'm not religious and usually when religion factors in, the book can get preachy. But, the principle of the book about a man being torn from his home, men dealing with wanting to be fathers who will have to deal with the legal system, money, and children's reactions, make for an outstanding story. I really enjoyed this one, besides a few times when it got a little too preachy for me."
5,BEST STEPHEN KING EVER!,"A physchological thriller that enters the realm of molestation as a child, bondage, and self-esteem. Throughout the days Jessie is hand-cuffed to her bed and her husband lay dead on the floor, she is revisted with past emotions that make each hour she is chained to the bed a living. Through hearing voices, and seeing figures, she allows her self to release her emotions in a frightful, yet melodramatic way, creating an intense, frightful novel that keeps the reader reading just wondering how much more she will sink into the depths of emotional hell."
2,Could have been better,"Gerald's Game is the first Stephen King book I have ever read. The beginning of the book had a lot of promise, but soon the story dragged on and on. Don't get me wrong, there were some very interesting parts in the story, but only parts. The best part of the book for me was towards the end when Jesse was trying to make her escape (loved the car scene). Of the three other Stephen King books that I have read (Desperation, Rose Madder, and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon), Gerald's Game ranks at the bottom."
2,Not a good example of King's work,"I have probably read about 15-20 of Stephen King's book and this is one of the worst by far. I haven't read much of his work since because it was very disappointing.If you want an example of good writing by Stephen King try some of the following books: Misery, The Stand, The Talisman, Four past midnight, and anything in the gunslinger series."
3,"Good, but not great....","I loved the Idea and this book came highly recommended. It started off well, slowed down and then picked up again.....While this was a little kinkly, I was hoping for a little more. While it was scary, It never really got me. Live or Die, I couldn't really connect....."
3,This book dragged on & on,"Basically 90% of this book deals with a woman (Jessie) handcuffed to a bed in a cabin while her husband (Gerald) lies dead on the floor. My problem w/ the book was that it just goes on & on & on & after 200+ pages it gets a bit boring. The ending has a good plot twist, but it's just getting to the end that made me not like this book. Plus, I never really liked Jessie's character & I was more concerned about the dog than the her. I think this would have made a better short story.... Not one of King's best."
3,I don't think Stephen King wrote it.,"Did anyone else notice how many other reviews suggest that this book is somewhat out of the ordinary for SK? The book follows too few of the SK signatures. It is too short. It gets to the action far too soon, without enough of the requsite character development. Also, as the story proceeds, an experienced SK reader can feel when he is in a passage written by the master. I can almost hear the real writer calling down the hall, ""Stephen, its time for you to come in and spice this up for me."" If you haven't guessed, I think the book was written by his wife, Tabitha, so they could give the world a big ""I told you so"" when it got great reviews - somewhat of a reverse of what he did with Richard Bachman."
2,"Good Writing, Mediocre Book","The story begins and continues, and continues, and continues in Jessie and Gerald Burlingame's lake cabin bedroom where a sex game ends tragically. I give King credit for his excellent writing, but this excellent writing gives him the ability to write page after page after page about almost nothing. I read the first third of the book hoping desperately that the pace would pick up. At that point I finally did something I never do, read snatches and bits in the rest of the book, and, of course, the ending.King's protagonist is Jessie Burlingame, and he does a good job of getting inside the mind of a woman. I just didn't care particularly for that woman.The other two King books I read are ""Salem's Lot"" and ""The Green Mile,"" both superb. Those two books are so good that it is hard to believe the same person authored ""Gerald's Game"". I'll probably read more King books, as ""two out of three ain't bad!"""
1,Got a refund on this one.......,"I have been reading King's stories for years, but this was a waste of my time and money. It dragged on and on. I know King is capable of much better writing than this. This book was boring, predictable and a waste of the paper upon which it was printed. This story has no redeeming qualities. I would have given it minus 10 stars if possible."
2,One of King's worst,"From the mind that gave us 'IT' and 'Pet Sematary' comes Gerald's Game. I'm sorry, but this was just awful. SK's gas tank of horror must have been on fumes around this time. It seems he switched from frightening nightmares to battered women. It started with Gerald's Game and continued with Delores Claybourne and Rose Madder.This story was just dumb. Wolves in the kitchen is one thing, but slitting your wrists to use the blood as lubricant to escape handcuffs? Uh...no."
1,Geralds Game Review,This book absoluely stinks! Not only is it sick it spends teh whole time wrestling with mind games. If you are into psycology and that u MAY like it but anyone else...pick something else.
2,YUK!,"I only gave it a 3 because it is by King. This is a book thatI wished I had borrowed from a friend or the library, rather thanbuying it. Waste of $. The only consilation is that it makes my King library complete. Nothing happens in this story. It makes it seems as though she has been tied to this bed for YEARS!!!"
1,Horrid Little Book,"I have read most of Stephen King's books, this by far is my least favorite. Yes, it is sick, but dreadfully boring at the same time. I could not even finish the book. I really have nothing ""good"" to say about it, except that maybe it was an interesting idea initially but somewhere the plot just went no where. (And of course the main character goes ""no where"" because she's handcuffed to a bed post, and you are left with her just thinking and thinking about nothing much at all) In speaking to another King fan, he was unable to finish this book as well, and was severely disappointed. Well, I guess I need to find somebody I don't care for to give them my hardcover edition of this book, because I certainly wouldn't give it to a friend."
1,What was he thinking?,"I have been a die-hard Stephen King fan for 16 years. Two of my favorite books in the world are written by him. I've got nothing but love for the guy. But seriously... Geralds Game was boring and just plain bad. I gave it a shot. I tried so hard to get into this book, but I gave up 3/4 of the way through. Normally, King books start off slow and pick up nicely, but this one started off great and ended up boring me to tears. If you want one to keep you up all night reading, buy ""Insomnia"" (no pun intended) ."
4,"A Terrifying, Wonderful, Psychological Thriller","This is one of King's most amazing books. There is nothing ""boring"" or ""drawn-out"" about it! Just imagine yourself in such a situation, and that's what King does, he brings you into her world, her mind, as she struggles with herself (and past and present horrors) to keep sane while facing an imminent and agonizing death. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because the ending seems a little exaggerated compared with the rest of the book. But it's really worth reading, I put it down only when the stress got to be too much!!!"
4,Yet another great getaway from King,"This book has the making of a very creepy situation. Who else would of thought of this sort of scenerio? I found myself alone one evening right before bed reading the chapter where the evil thing made of bones has his first appearance and I have to admit, I shot a quick glance toward the corner of my room, just in case. King can do this, and maybe it isn't his Nobel Peace Prize winner, but it sure is worth the ride!!"
3,Very Graphic,"A strange thing happened as I was reading Gerald's Game: You know how when a movie gets just too gross, you close your eyes or put your hands in front of your face? Well, I would be reading along, and it would get so graphic that I would snap my eyes shut, of course realizing that the strategy doesn't work the same when one is reading. At one point, when she finally figures out how to get out of the handcuffs, I actually skipped 2 pages because it was just too graphic. There is no way I would go back and read that part--I still have a vivid image of that scene. Would I recommend the book? I was glued to it until I was done, but you have to be ready for it."
2,Why?,"After masterpieces as Carrie, Running Man and others: Stephen King writes his worst book so far. Why did I bother to read it?"
4,Scary and Thrilling,"I have read this book a few times, and each time I can't put it down until I finish it. This is definitely not a book for the squeamish! I think it is superbly written, you feel every agonizing moment Jessie goes through to achieve her freedom and come to terms with her past. Not your ""average"" Stephen King novel, but still with his great talent for storytelling. A scary, gripping read!"
4,Horrific!!!!!,"This is classic King, at his best...The characters are so real you won't believe it! The space cowboy was a very tricky character, because you didn't know if he existed or not...No one could tell this story better than King."
1,400 Pages Too Long,"Talk about a long dark night of the soul--this was a dark week of the soul! This woman gets to retrospect about her whole boring WASPy childhood and equally dull marriage while handcuffed to a bed in a rural cottage. We get to experience that boredom and scrutiny minutiae with her. Yikes. Forget the water, you're gonna need a good strong scotch to get through this one."
4,Getting involved in Gerald's Game,"Gerald's Game was, by far, one of the best Stephen King stories I have ever read! It isn't your typical monster-in-the-closet King novel. Gerald's Game was a look at the real monster that plagues so many... one's own imagination. This novel is a definate thriller. Intense and suspenseful... King takes strong, intelligent Jessie Burlingame to the darkest depths of the human psyche (and brings his readers along for the ride). It's lack of boogeymen and aliens makes this novel easy to get drawn into. King will have you on the edge of your seat from page 1."
2,Dissapointed,"I am a huge fan of Stephen King books, but was very dissapointed by this book. The story goes on for too long in the same surrounding. Jessie is virtually tied to the bed for the whole book. This made my mind drift, whereas usually King is able to take and hold my concentration for ages. I have just started the book 'IT' and already have read 200 pages in 5 days, whereas it took me over 3 weeks to finish the 300 pages of Geralds Game."
2,Definitely not my favorite...,"I have read all of King's books, and this one was my least favorite. Overall, I love it when he changes his style a bit (Eye of the Dragon, two of the books from the Dark Tower series, etc. were great)...but I just couldn't get into this one. The plot was somewhat interesting, but the story DRAGGED. I kept reading, thinking the ending would make the story worth reading. This couldn't be FURTHER from the truth! I think the ending actually ruined the book. It was totally unrelated, just didn't fit in at all. Of all of King's books, I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,"Slow, drawn out, interesting, regrettable.","Was this book good? No, Was it one of his (SK) better? No. Do we know why? Yes. The ending was terrible. Granted, the book was very interesting at some points, especially when they talked of Jessie's childhood and the mysteries surrounding it. But when I realized I was more excited about what happened to her as a little girl instead of her predicament with the handcuffs (which was the plotline of the book), I noticed this wasn't such a good book afterall. And to top it off, the ending was horrible. I can't say why without giving away all the secrets, but what SHOULD'VE been the final ""fade-out"" was followed by fifty more pages of complete torture and anguish that just totally ruined the novel. Stephen King and his diarrhea of the mouth was just a little bit too much to handle this time around. If you're looking for a GOOD King novel, read Desperation."
2,Wasn't completely moved when finished.,"I know that these things do happen in real life, but I was not at all impressed by this book. It totally disgusted me."
2,BORING!!!!! ONE OF KING'S WORST,One of the worst books I've read. It is the worst book by king. I dont know what to call it. There's no action there's almost no drama and it's definetly not scary. I wont spoil the end for those of you who are reading it just to see for yourselves. But the thing with the guy who breaks into graveyards come on king do ya think were etiots.I read the review's before I started this book and I wanted to see for myself. And it sucked. The real fault of the book is that it's basicaly boring. I mean the story go's almost nowhere.I commend mr.king for trying something different but it just dos'nt work. If you want a good king book then get insomnia or desparation. And whoever thinks this book is good as way to much time on their hands.Full of horny sex and downright stupidity.Good try but no cigar mr.king.
1,This is kings worst book ever written,I could not even finish it. I have never not read a kings book all the way through . I really couldn't get into it. If you want to read a good book try the stand or rose madde
1,This is scary?,"Plot...woman handcuffed to bed, may die from it. Okay, that's it. You need a seriously overactive adrenal gland to find this book frightening. Either that or read this book with one hand cuffed to a bedpost for effect. Maybe if you're the type to get grossed out easily (and if that's the case, why are you reading a Steven King novel). Only worth buying if you need to polish off a complete Steven King library, and even then I wouldn't suggest actually reading it."
1,His Worst Book!,"I am a big fan of King, but I can say with certainty that this is his worst novel. It may have been better as a short story."
4,Gerald's Game,"Just getting started-but loving it! My only complaint is the amount of typo's! I can not help but wonder why the E version has so many mistakes? I can not believe the paper book would be allowed to print with this many mistakes. Small complaint, but I do find them distracting. Oh well, I will try to ignore them and continue with this great story!"
2,One of king's few disapointments,"It starts interestingly enough and that's where the fun ends. Gerald wants to play a game. He handcuffs his wife to the bed and then dies of a heart attack. Sounds good right? I thought so too, then i kept reading and the story kept dragging, then it dragged some more. Her character gets developed and then overdeveloped while nothing is happening except her being shackled to a bed that she can't leave. Then theres a revelation. It didn't really make sense to me though because i couldn't grasp the concept of why and how the book unfolded the way it did, especially the final chapters. One of his few forgettable novels."
1,DON'T BOTHER,So far this is the only Stephen King book I really disliked. It is too long to not have a plot. The only incentive to completing the book is to discover how the main character makes out.
4,The Abusive Man Gets What He Deserves,"The abusive man handcuffs his wife to the bed post. Gosh, I hated that. That is so cruel and abusive. He then has a heart attack and dies. Here she is, handcuffed to the bed, in a remote cabin and no one is there to get her out. How will she get out, or will she even get out? Needless to say, the whole situation is psychologically disturbing.The book was really good, and I especially loved the ending. But it did have a long, boring middle; that's why I gave it 4 stars. The middle could have been condensed into a third as many pages, and then I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Not one of King's best,I am a die hard Stephen King fan and well this big does have some good high tension parts to it most of it is just really long and drawn out to the point where I was actually bored and wanted to just quit reading the book but I managed to get through it and it was so much less than what I expected.
4,Gerald's Game,Order was received and processed quickly. Delivery was made in good time and condition. A Stephen King classic and excellent addition to collection.
4,Spooky,"From what I heard of this book (a friend read it) it is rather full in places but gets good towards the end when Jessie starts ""hullucinating."" I'm buying the book for myself so I can read it."
2,BORROW FROM THE LIBRARY!,"Gerald's Game was okay, but I thought it would have been best in one of his short story collections, rather than a full novel. A few edge of the seat moments, especially when the main character is trying for the glass of water - I find it hard to fault King's work, but I'm glad I borrowed this from the library, rather that buying it outright"
5,Mind blower,This book definitely played deep games with the mind. It wasn't great but I still could not put it down. It was a mind reading experience
2,A big fan left cold...,"I am a huge fan of Stephen King and I own every book he's written, but I was very disapointed in Gerald's Game. This was the first time a Stephen King book ever bored me. It might have worked as a short story, but I struggled to finish it as a novel. The only reason I didn't give up was that I kept hoping the King I loved to read would appear. He didn't."
3,Not the usual King Fare,"This book was a complete thriller, just not your normal horror of King. I don't know that this book would have gotten published without his name on it. I mean, it deals with a woman chained to a bed for 95% of the ENTIRE book! (although the plot twist at the end is at least one saving grace...good job Stevie, and thats what saved it from a 2 star."
4,Stephen King Gerald's Game,"Stephen King Gerald's Game: An old favorite and so glad to have it again. We received it in good condition, thank you."
4,Ever hear of PROOFREADING?,"As with every Stephen King book I've ever read, I found this one to be a page turner and enjoyed the story. However, I wish as much attention was paid to Kindle books as the hardcopies receive. This was littered with way too many typos, stray punctuation, and wrong words. Not an issue from the author, I'm certain. Either bring the coversion process back ONSHORE, or have a little human interaction (from someone who actually reads) in the process. Some of us still actually care about grammar and clean text - even in a slightly racy story line!"
4,Realistically horrifying,I love how Steven King was really able to play the role of a woman in this novel. What horrified me the most was how such a terrible thing could actually happen to anyone. The way Jessie's room in her vacation home ends up gradually turning into a real life torture chamber is amazing. The way King describes with such detail how Jessie suffered every second made me feel as though I were in those cuffs with her. As a reader I became so engaged that during the intervals when I wasn't reading I was actually spending my workdays wondering how I would manage to escape from such an authentically horrendous situation.This was by far one of my favorite novels from King.
3,"Gerald's Game, Will Gerald be the Only Loser?","Gerald's Game is an okay read but not in the masterpiece league as some of King's other work such at It, Thinner, Misery and some of his other novels. To be honest it would have been better as a short story or novella as it starts off extremely well but does drag on a bit in parts especially as Jessie remembered the past. Not the can't put down page turner that some of King's other work is but an interesting read none the less. I especially liked Prince, he should have had more coverage.Gerald's Game is a story through the eyes of Jessie Burlingame who has both hands handcuffed to a bed in a remote cabin while her rapist husband Gerald lies dead on the floor. The terror she goes through as she begins to understand her predicament, listens to the voices in her head and remembers events from the past she had subconsciously forgotten over the years are portrayed."
2,a stephen king fan's worst nightmare,"This is the worst Stephan King book I've read. It's slow and lacks plot; it's a concept rather than a story. A woman finds herself trapped in her house- with only her ""voices"" to keep her company. Not much plot can develope with one character. Bits of this book show traces of the much better novel ""CUJO."" If King had done this as a short story it might have worked."
1,"One long, boring book","I never thought I'd be bored by Stephen King, but ""Gerald's Game"" almost put me to sleep every time I picked it up to read on. The book started OK, but King got stuck on Act 1, Scene 1. It was like listening to an old 45 with a scratch that keeps repeating the same part. After 130 pages of wading through the same Scene, I started flipping ahead 50 pages at a time and was shocked to find that the story was still in the same place, and stayed there until about the last 30 pages. I gave up. What a waste of time!"
2,Onlt for die hard King fans,Only Stephen King is capable of writing more than four hundred pages featuring a single character and full it with chepa psychologic drama. Blergh !
1,gerald's game,Please! I want my evening back! The worst piece of drivel ever written. What ever happened to the guy that wrote the Shining?
2,Longing for adventure,"I have to agree, this book was very detailed and the plot was exciting and kept you on your toes however there was a period of neverending silence. For someone like myself who doesn't read much, it made it extremely hard to want to finish the book."
3,Not vintage King,"As a Stephen King fan of many years, Gerald's game was too non-King to make an impact. If it had been written by anybody other than King, I would have been less critical, but one expects better from The Master. A wishy-washy story of one woman tied to a bed, with page after page of how she struggles to reach a glass of water...It's not King at his best and, frankly, it's not even King in average form. It won't put me off buying more of his books, though, because even God has bad book days!"
2,Unimpressive,"Once again, Stephen King takes an otherwise delicious plot idea and bores the hell out of his readers. He makes the same mistake as the creators of the movie _Falling_Down_, insisting that only insane people perform even slightly deviant acts. His continuing failure to understand WHEN to end a novel is quickly destroying the enthusiasm of at least one fan. Maybe he understood this when he started writing under a pen name. Maybe he's just realized that his loyal fans will buy whatever crap he puts out. Oh, and for all you rabid King fans who flamed me for my last review: Yes, I've actually read this one, too."
2,"Not terrible, but not good either.","This book is just downright unpleasant. The main character's main attribute is that she's crazy, and the villain, who seems pretty scary, is underused. If he'd been taken out of the book entirely, you wouldn't even notice.flag"
1,What was he thinking?,"I am a very big King fan, but this has to go under the category of ""the book he never should have written"". A premise that cannot be sustained for 300 pages and more importantly, it's boring. Read this only if you have made some kind of pact with yourself to read every one of King's books and then save it until last."
4,tough book to finish,"I really enjoy King and have read many of his books. I almost gave up on this one (which I never do) around page 200. I started thinking, man King could write 300 pages about a dime sitting on a shelf if he really wanted to (or a girl cuffed to a bed).This story really gets going around page 225 or so, and seems to me this first part of the book could have been edited down to around 50 pages. In the end King did not let me down... Stick with it, I think you'll enjoy it. If you're looking for ""top shelf"" King, invest your time in the Dark Tower series - you will not regret it."
2,I neither cared whether Jessie lived or died.,"King sets himself a difficult task here. He must sustain our interest in a single character who is alone, chained to a bed, and likely to die.While admiring his resourcefulness, his narrative skills, and many other of his books, I must report that I soon lost interest in his character Jessie and her predicament. I don't object to identifying with a character and sharing her long drawn-out agony if the experience is, paradoxically, a liberating one. One hour with Jessie, however, made me feel callous, heartless and dispirited. I neither cared whether she lived or died."
3,I finished it...and threw it.,"I'm not a violent person. Mild mannered. Kind to animals. This book...was one of those I thought...several times...""he's kidding, right?"" Then I got to the end of the book and threw it on the floor saying ""I wasted all my nights for THIS?"". I rarely throw things. It was late. I was tired.The concept was an intriguing one, but the execution of it a bit much. I found myself thinking there's got to be more to this story for it to get such good reviews...and hung onto the end even though I wanted to stop reading it several times...thinking...ok..there's GOT to be some huge twist or something to this. I never got my surprise, but hey, maybe I missed the point.I just add this review not to be a crab, but just to add my opposing viewpoint. Thanks for reading."
2,Not Among King's Best Work (by a longshot),"I have to say that I really got into this book right up until after the escape from the handcuffs. As far as I'm concerned, it could have ended there and I would have been more inclined to call it a good read. But it didn't end there, and what followed was some of the most boring, nonsensical wordiness that I've ever been subjected to. When it comes to King, I'm a big fan, but Gerald's Game was almost like reading two different books: one pretty decent, and one quite not.I'm still reeling from the disappointment."
3,Stephen King,This one I bought on my Kindle. It was a nice price and all but a lot of typos in the book! It really irks me when there is a misspelled word in a book! Great story though. Stephen King is awesome and I am a faithful reader!
2,"This from the guy who wrote ""The Stand"" and ""It""?","I can see this as one of those zany Billy Crystal movies--were it not for the fact that Billy as Gerald would croak in the first scene. Reality check--time out! It this story, Gerald and Jessie go to their cabin out in the wilderness, where Gerald decides to ""enhance"" their lovemaking with a mild bondage trick. He binds her wrists and ankles to the bedposts--and breaks his fool neck! Literally. The rest of the story puts Jessie in the position of a woodchuck caught in a trap. She's got a husband dead on the floor nearby, but not another soul within miles to help. It might have made a so-so short story in one of King's anthologies. Then again, his editors might have tried to talk him out of it. Whatever the case, it ain't no novel. And it ain't much of a story."
3,Oi. Grueling. I pray it never happens to me...,"Now, this was a well-written book that I couldn't wait to put down! It was just too torturous to read, but of course I always finish every King novel, and I was just laughing to myself because I guess I've read more of this writer's works than anyone else's, except maybe Faulkner and Dickens."
2,Wordy ... Boring ... Clever,I think this is a boring story ... 400+ pages about a lady tight up in a bed? I think he could have written the same story in 40 pages max ... I guess you could say that the author does an amazing job writing a whole novel about one lady in one room ... But why should the author and the reader be handicapped like that? ... What is it some kind of writing excerise? ... Anybody else writes this book and it never gets published
1,snoozer,"Let me save you some time.A lady ends up handcuffed to a bed when her husband dies during kinky sex games. She's stuck there for a while, and some weirdo's watching her. Then she gets rescued.Mr.King, did your son write this one as part of his first grade entrance exam?"
2,BORING!,"The dog part was kinda interesting but the eclipse flashback(s) was disgusting and the rest of the book was really boring. It also could have easily ended about 50 or 60 pages before it did. But at least its short for a King book (445 pages) and I was able to force myself through it in a few days. Out of the 17 or so King books I've read this was definitely the worst, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to read every Stephen King book there is. - - 3/10"
3,Games,"We play games, and due to the nature of this world, sometimes we get into big trouble, and extraordinary experiences happen to quite ordinary characters, namely, to us. Snip: (...)"
2,"Too many words, too many pages, too few results.","You'd think that a women handcuffed to a bed with a dead husband on the floor and a famished stray dog at the door would lead to suspense and terror. Well, it didn't. Mr. King left us wandering somewhere amid all the words. I was very disappointed since the early promise was unfulfilled. This wasn't up to his usual standards and can easily be skipped in favor of almost any other offering from his usually more fruitful mind and pen."
2,One of his worst,"This book seems almost like a bet someone made with Stephen King. They wanted to see just how good he was. ""Can you write a whole book about a woman lying on a bed?""Any other author would have gotten a 1 on a book that goes nowhere and has very little happen. Stephen King just didn't have enough to work with. This was perhaps more of a character study, a chance to get into someone's head and see what they can learn about themselves from extremely stressful conditions. People who like artsy foreign films will probably love it. For someone like me who's more interested in a good story, I spent the whole book wondering when something significant would happen. I only bothered to finish the book because I kept thinking that some radical twist would put it all into a new perspective but I was dead wrong. Gerald's Game would have been an excellent short story, or a ""MacGyver"" episode. But stretching this 20 page plot into a full book made it painfully slow and boring."
3,Good-BAD-GOOD,"This book definately starts out interesting, however the middle 3/5 of this book is tedious and painfully slow. However the great ending ammends for some of its earlier sins. Definately would not want to read it twice."
2,ACK...a BIG dissapointment,"this book was hardly what i expected. Dont get me wrong, i am i huge fan of his books but this one truely was boring!!! it takes a LLOOONNGG time to get to the point and once you get there, its not the usual ""creepy and strange"" novel you had expected.in other words, dont waste your time on this book. Get a true King book like FIRESTARTER or SALEMS LOT..."
2,What was King thinking??,"I am a die-hard King fan through and through, but this book brought me to tears. The book's plot was nonexistent at best. This has to be the first and hopefully the only book of his that was absolutely disappointing."
3,It drags on and on!,"First of all, Stephen King did a great job writing this novel as well as putting it in the market. Its a story that anybody in the world can actually ""fall"" into. Its horrifying. Frightening novel! Jessie and her husband Gerald are not a typical couple. Their relationship involves fear and abuse. Although the novel is full of suspense at the beginning, the story drags on as it moves towards the end. Overall, I recommend this book for readers who liked King's previous suspense novels!"
3,i think SK should take a break,"i compare most of SK's early works to recent work, i find that his novel's getting worse. he should really seriously think about that too...for this book, it start great in the beginning but soon it gets boring as the pages go on and the ending's acceptable."
2,Dragged on a bit,Many people will enjoy this book but for me it was not a King best. Even the skin ripping climax did not help as the first three quarters did not really get going.
5,Betty & Veronica gorgeous sexpots that will always rock!,"Ok, so I truly loved Betty & Veronica the most from everything. Now add the beach and all their amazing bathing suits through the time and this was so great! If you love a Betty & Veronica centered comic then this one is for you. Watch them compete for Archie's love and other guys on the beach. BEAUTIFUL!"
4,Nice blast from the past,"Archie comics have always been one of the more pure fun comics still around. It's nice to view some samples from the 1960's, especially of the vivacious Betty and Veronica. The art is clean and crisp and brought up to specs of newer comics and as usual, always fun to read."
3,rockstand by Warwick hardshell folding stand,"Missing the bar that goes across the top . Thats right, and thats just for starters. The thin tolex is already bubbling and peeling and was torn in two places .the lid doesnt fit very good and is thin and flimsy. There are staples holding the Velcro on the bottom that are guaranteed to scratch and gouge every guitar. American music supply sent another one out immediately and a prepaid label for the return . The replacement was complete but the tolex was still thin and bubbling up and the staples on the Velcro is still an issue but for the money its ok ...5 stars for American music supply!"
3,Buyer Beware,"Note of caution: This cartridge will not fit my Ryobi 130r. It's probably my stupid mistake because my 130r was not listed as a model it would fit. What lured me is the statement that it would fit any Ryobi using 0.095 string. Mine can, and does, use that size string. Returning this item is not a cost-effective use of my time or money. Maybe I can sell it to a neighbor for half price?? I have no beef with the product itself. It's the same brand I have been using, but a different size and part number. It should work fine in the correct Ryobi model. Nuff said."
3,Not a Ryobi Product,"The title indicates that this is a Ryobi product. It is not or at least the one I received was a MTD OEM replacement unit. It works on my weed eater but the description is misleading say ""by Ryobi""."
5,The last real rock band standing in Los Angeles,"Anyone who has the plain ol' common sense to like these guys won't be disappointed with ""In The City."" It is the best cd I have purchased in a LONG time. It has all the things you expect from the Hangmen: hard driving rock and ""punk and roll"" songs, as well as slower, countrified ""if Ennio Morricone had a Les Paul/Marshall stack"" songs. SHORT VERSION: THIS CD IS BRILLIANT!!!! Their best release since the EPIC ""We've Got Blood..."" and it carries on in that fine tradition/legacy. Produced by Mike Ness of Social Distortion, who co-wrote a track on it as well.These guys are the genuine article. Swoop on this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,erratic so-called music,"This collection has a couple slow-moving relaxing pieces but on the whole the music is eratic, clashing and just plain wrongly titled...it should be titled as lively. I hate it."
2,Mediocre performances with violin,Disappointing CDs - wanted good examples of violin music for grandchild taking lessons - this set does not accomplish the goal
4,Not as good as I remember,"This book had some interesting ideas, and I remembered enjoying it as a kid. 23 years later it wasn't as spellbinding. Still not bad, but the writing and plot is fairly simplistic. The original Conan series are an obvious influence and better."
2,"Software has glitches. Also, ""toll free number"" non-existent","I just got Office XP and wanted to learn the software, so I purchased this.This program keeps freezing on the ""Access"" tutorial, with no way to click on the other Office titles (Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). I tried uninstalling and reloading 2x to no avail. Very frustrating.Clearly, this has bugs in the programming. I'm going to buy one of their competitive publisher's Office XP training programs (which will hopefully work!) and return this.Also, like the previous reviewer, their ""toll-free"" number asks you to call a regular number - misleading advertising."
3,Learn2 Microsoft Office xp Complete Training Series,"first of all, the 1-800 phone number on the package refers you to another number that isn't toll-free. It's all cd-rom and information on the package. That's it. I ran into problems: the tutorial kept stopping and it wasn't until the next day that I caught on that it was pausing by itself unprompted--it seemed that there was a glitch in the program--but it kept pausing and pausing and pausing. Uninvited. The tests are simple but let you know if you get the basics."
2,Horse didnt like it.,"The only reason I gave it a 2 is because my horse didn't even sniff it. I paid a lot for my horse to just look at it. whats really weird is she LOVES anything sweet but, didn't like this."
4,Good,"Yes, the book is a good one, even flows and transitions between ideas very nicely. only problem that i have with the book... is that quite a bit of the information should already be known by all."
1,"A typical psychologist ""anecdotal"" concoction...","...the authors attempt to evaluate what makes a marriage last by interviewing couples...or at least they CLAIMED they interviewed these couples...frankly, I have to wonder if they simply didn't make up the couples as well as the interviews...there seems to be little overlap in characteristics of the relationships...also, the interviewee responses strike me as quite contrived and really don't sound very authentic...the responses of the men, in particular, sound more like something a woman would IMAGINE a man saying...sorry but I just don't think there is much to be gained from this book."
5,Very Good Research,"I was very pleased with this book. I felt like it was pretty much right on. I am one of those in a companionate marriage, that has tettered on divorce a couple of times. It has been very difficult keeping it together. The most desireable of marriages and it seemed the most happy was the romantic catogory of Marriage. If I ever decide to leave this marriage after 30 yrs, that will be the type I will look for in a relationship. Too much emotional emptiness in the compantionate marriage."
3,"Some interesting points, but...","As a previous reviewer said, the couples interviewed were above average means and I did not see any discussion on finances or money. [however, I hopped around a bit in the book]I've read (oops, don't know where...) that money is a frequent cause of divorce. Were all these couples above average means? That doesn't sound like a true representative sampling.Perhaps that's a minor point, but in my own marriage of 21 years, money issues have been quite challenging at times. I'd like to hear how other couples resolved those problems.On the other hand, the book offers the promise that there are still good marriages out there. That the words ""happy marriage"" are not oxymoronic.And it's always interesting to take a peak into the lives of someone else, with the high goal of learning how to improve your own situation.Rose"
2,rewritten is not better,"I am a Nancy Drew fan...for over thirty years..as my mother was before me and my daughter after me. This rewitten version is not up to the thrills and chills of the edition by Mildred Wirt Benson in the 1930's. This edition lacks the intrige of the first..it is more ""up to date"" and P.C. than the first, but I suggest that anyone who loves Nancy and has only read this book obtain a copy of the original that has been published by Applewood Books..it even has the fantastic old illustrations."
5,Amazing book,"This book is so intreging! I seriously could not put it down... literally. Anyone whos reading this should totally read this book. Youll have the same expierence as me, getting lost in nancy drew!"
5,A must have for all Nancy Drew fans!,I love everything Nancy Drew but these books are my favorite I cant wait to get them all in my collection. If you love Nancy Drew or are just getting into it or havent heard of her these are a must have for everyone.
4,Pretty Good,This was my first Nancy Drew Book and I think that it was very well written. But there was not that much mystery but there was alot of action so I'm very gald that I was able to try out the Nancy Drew Series:-)
5,Check this out!,"I think it's great that we've got an German artist now who comes close to what American HipHop-Freaks do. In a matter of fact, I think that this Album is even better than some American HipHop-albums. You can listen to this CD when you want to party, as well as to chill out. Afrob definitely rocks! And nobody can deny! Check it out, before you smile on German HipHop!"
3,No instructions,My packaging came without instructions. What do you do to the stations to activate them? Do you just take them out of the container and spread them around?
1,skeptical,"I just received the ant baits and as noted by another customer, there are only four baits. It is also packaged differently from what is advertised so I am skeptical if this is the same product that others have raved about. I will try product and follow-up with another review."
1,a little short,"Hmmm...the package I got had only four traps in it, not the advertised six. Will see how they work."
5,Excellent,The usual spring ants searching for water ... this fine product seemed to wipe them out in a day!My bathroom window ... looked like an ant farm after placing the 1st bait ... so I added a 2nd bait ...no ants whatsoever within 24 hours. And it's been a week and still no activity.EXCELLENT PRODUCT worth every penny. Thank you!
5,Ants gone in 3 days!!!,This product worked just as described. The ants are all gone after 3 days! It was actually kind of interesting watching them all come for the bait and take it to the colony. WE watched the colony die off and we haven't seen one ant since! This is amazing we've been doing everything from keeping counters clean to spraying RAID ant killer and these finally did the trick. Its been two weeks and I think the ants are gone for good. If they come back we still have three baits from the package so they won't be around long!
5,The BES ant baits!,"Ants love this stuff to death! They eat, go back to the nest to tell their friends, more ants come, and then... they all mysteriously disappear! Locally, it's incredibly hard to find, so I was really happy to find it on Amazon. All the other traps I've tried are a complete waste of time and money -- buy this brand, it's the best!"
2,Middle of the road mixes,"This is a selection of mixes some sampled and some orignal stuff, lacked the fat funky feel that I like to hear in mixed beats. DJ's have to remember that eventhough your are mixing beats, sounds and different genres the music still must take off in some direction and maintain some substance."
4,Attractive item; LOUSY accompaniments.,"I ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card. The box, while attractive at first glance, is flimsy, got slightly crushed in transit, and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on. The card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully, and the message inside is not centered, making it impossible to trim down. Said message inside appears to have been written in plain old Times New Roman script. I could do far better on my own printer, and for the cost, I could get a much more attractive card at a store. I will say, however, that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos. I might order from Silver Insanity again, but I'm not paying for any of the ""frills""- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this in hopes of cleaning the laser lens for my Xbox without spending much money at all (I'd rather spend 4$ over 10$ any day) It worked at first, but after only a few sessions, the Xbox no longer reads discs again.Maybe it actually works on DVD readers, but I wouldn't recommend buying this for a gaming console."
1,over $500 in repairs,"We bought this PAC-man cocktail table and within 2 months it was broken. Took months to find someone who knew how to fix it and once we did he was appalled at the quality of work inside the machine. Old computer monitor was installed in the unit which was not meant for it. We replaced the monitor with one meant for the gaming machine and shortly after the power supply went out as well. We contacted the seller repeatedly with questions and it was up to us to pay for repairs. The game technician couldn't believe we had been so badly taken advantage of. Not sure if seller was aware of the poor quality he was selling us, but saddened he provided no help or reimbursement for poor quality product."
3,ARE YOU F****** HIGH,1200-1500 DOLLARS ID RATHER GET A PLUG AND PLAY THAN PAY THAT I LOOOOOOOOOOVE PAC MAN BUT THIS IS WORTH 500 DOLLARS TOPS PLUS IT'S NOT EVEN LICENSED
4,A practical guide for webmasters,"As the title suggests, this book is targeted for Webmasters with some knowledge of client-side scripting assumed. The examples are clear and most are general enough to be usable in any website. Later parts of the book go into short descriptions of XML-related products currently on the market and their inevitable quirks (most being beta code). Much of this would have been better handled with a link to the author's website considering that a good deal of this info may be obsolete in a few weeks. In the same vein, the included CD which includes a small example website done using XML could have easily been provided online, reducing the overall cost of the book."
5,Very accurate portrayal of Israeli aviation.,"I enjoyed this book so much I gave it to my father-in-law in Israel, who was actively involved in building the Israeli Air Force and Israel Aircraft Industries from their onset, and knew the people and events depicted in the book first hand. After reading it, he said it is a very accurate portrayal."
4,Songs from another time and place,"""Lotta Love"" was a staple of FM radio in the dim, dark 70s, and remains a joy to hear. However, this album showcases Nicolette's wide range of vocal styles from wistful ballads (French Waltz, Last In Love) through to funky up-tempo numbers (Baby, Don't You Do It, and Can't Get Away From You) to more laid-back AOR (Give A Little). Personal favourites are the good-humoured country-flavoured ""Come Early Mornin'"" and her beautifully phrased interpretation of Sam Cooke's soul classic ""You Send Me"".There's something for everybody here who likes their music soulful, with a dash of spice."
4,LOTTA LOVE AND MORE,"If musical diversity is a crime, Nicolette Sheridan would probably be guilty. Her 1978 debut album certainly crosses many musical borders. I prefer to view diversity as an asset--particularly when the material is done well. Ms. Larson does well!Powered by the successful Top 10 single, Neil Young's LOTTA LOVE, the album demonstrates Ms. Larson's evocative and expressive vocals, paired with top-notch composers and musicians. My personal favorites: the flirtatious RHUMBA GIRL; the emotional Souther-Frey ballad, LAST IN LOVE; the soulful cover of Sam Cooke's YOU SEND ME; and Holland/Dozier's BABY DON'T DO IT.I'm not a bluegrass fan so I don't care too much for ANGELS REJOICED but it does show Nicolette's diversity. All in all, NICOLETTE is an enjoyable listening experience and a good reflection of 70's pop."
5,Gone too soon...,"The death last year of Nicolette Larson was very sad...I've been a fan of hers since the early '80's, and am having trouble getting some of her early albums on CD. Her voice is pure, without the pretentiousness of some other female vocalists. Listening to her music always brings back memories for my husband and me of the time we were courting!"
5,The Third Times The Charm!,"On their second albumLook-Ka Py PyThe Meters added vocals to their sound and 'Struttin' continues in that grand tradition.It's the most fun on the opener ""Chicken Strut"" with the wild,fun squaking comic vocals just right for a funky good time. A few heads might turn at the concept of ""Wichita Linesman"" (yet another overdone cover choice of the day) but again The Meters again bring a new soul to the tune with some emotional vocals. ""Same Old Thing"" finds them reprising ""Cissy Strut"" again with a tongue-in-cheek vocal emphasizing that phrase ""it's the same ol thing"" again and again. Again The Meters keep it spare for the most part but on ""Tippi-Toes"" and ""Hand Clapping Songs"" varriate on the rhythm.But for the most part you know exactly what your getting here but if you enjoy it as I do it's available."
3,A good funk/soul package!,"This is the third album by the Meters and introduced vocals to their style. I still prefer the instrumentals on this disc but the vocal numbers are good and lively. I only have one diificulty with not giving this 4 stars or more; the track ""Wichita Lineman"" just doesn't feel like it's part of this album. Listened in isolation it's fine, but it goes against the feel of the album as a whole. And ""Chicken Strut"" is just plain funny, in a goofy sort of way."
5,Better than the picture,"Great handle and the picture on Amazon does not due it justice. It is actually a nice bright safety yellow. Comes with a resin kit to permanently and securely attach it. No more wiggling head or flying head as I have had happen with old wood handles. If you leave your wooden handle axes outside don't wait to change out the handle, it is amazing how far an axe head can fly or the damage it will do if it comes off of a rotten wood handle."
5,Best ancients game,I have played Phil Viverito games fo over 15 years. It is by far the best ancients ruleset out there. It is the only one to recreate how Roman legions fought. Easy to learn. Easy to play.
3,Very good,This book describe ancient warfare very well. WIth an Intersting plot and well developed characters I give ths book a 4. I give it a 4 because in the middle there is a gapse of action. Other than this the book was great.
5,Greatest Remix Ever!,"I'm a long time Toby Mac and DC Talk listener and when I first heard Toby Mac's new CD Renovating Diverse city, I was blown away...it has everything I wanted to hear in a CD. From Jazz to Rap, and beats that just make you want to move. So for all of you thinking about buying Renovating Diverse City I highly recommend you doing so."
5,awesome cd,"This some is super, crazy, awesome!!! I especially loved ""Burn For You"" and ""Ill-im-i."" It is and awesome, and must have for any hip-hop fan. And all the guest singers, it makes it even more diverse ;)!"
2,BOOOOOOO ! ! !,Come on people it seems like every time Toby Mac makes a remix cd it's just a version of his songs with no guitar and lots of piano ? The only reason I even gave this two stars is because well it's still Toby and no matter how hard he tries he'll still be okay :) Don't get me wrong I looooooove his music just not his mixes .
5,Remixed but not ruined!,"First off he throws down a song unlike any Christian artist. I am new to the Tobymac music this year and can tell you I love it. His sound/genre seems to change depending on the song.Like most I am skeptical to buy remix cds. They are most usually not good. This one is really really good, even better than his other remix cd."
4,Best New Re:Mixes,"I was kind of skeptical when I got this album because I'm not too hot on Re:Mixes in general. Man was I blown away! I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it! I was very glad to hear that almost every song was completely different from the original; whether it be the speed of the song, the rhythm of the song, or even the words on the song! It was very refreshing after listening to Welcome to Diverse City for a year. Truett's new song is awesome as always (my family is always excited to hear him). All the producers did a fantastic job using their re:mixing capabilites. This is definitly I must buy cd for the end of summer. Great way to start off a new school year (even TruDogg agrees)."
5,Fantastic book,"This is one of the best novels I have ever read, if not the best. Vollmann's prose-- his use of language, his landscapes, his characterizations, everything-- is absolutely gorgeous. This book is such a treat that I intentionally read it slowly in order to savor it. I can't reccomend it highly enough."
4,I Believe Their Answer Is Ehhhhhhh...,"Mr. Thurber and Mr. White wrote a very amusing and rich satire on this basic of human conditions. In John Updike's foreword, he is correct in stating that this little gem of a book is quite phallocratic in its assumptions and has misogynistic tendencies. It was created all in good fun by two men in their early thirties and should be viewed as a product of its times (1929). This is very tame stuff in relation to present-day material, but still worth your time if you enjoy witty, nonsensical compositions. There's a good reason this baby is still kicking around eight decades after its initial publication. The book is a quick, light read by two pros."
3,The best idea in a long time.,The book is a cute idea and a great parody of 'professional' sex ed books that came out around the mid to late 1920's.
4,One of my favorite books,"I have very few favorite books, and this one is in my all-time favorite list. I bought this book as a fifth or sixth grader, I can't remember. Anyway, I've read it about 20 times and I love it. I've never had my parents go through divorce, so it was very interesting to find out what it's like to have your parents go through a divorce and live in two different houses through the eyes of a person my age at the time. The book, Fiona's Private Pages, I plan to read because I loved this book so much. I'm now in 8th grade and still read it when there's no other books to read. I highly recomend this book."
5,Keeps you guessing,"I really enjoyed this book. The book is about Fiona. She is about 11 for most of the book. Fiona is told she must keep a diary for her thoughts, especially the thoughts about her parent's recent divorce.I would recommend this book to 5th and 6th grade girls or if there was a divorce in a girl's family.Fiona's life changes a lot after her parent's divorce and it's great to hear how ""terrible"" her life is now.This book is really fun to read, even over summer vacation."
3,"As an emotional tool, it could be useful","Maybe this book could be a useful emotional tool for an 8-11 year old girl dealing with her parents' divorce. The author relates a lot of day-to-day minutae that kids of divorce must go through to one degree or another, and the book might help someone see that they're not alone in their situation.As youth fiction, it was just marginal. I didn't really hear a 10-11 year old girl talking - more like an adult trying to sound like a 10-11 year old girl. It was just not an authentic voice speaking from the pages."
5,Voice of the void,"Like Tarkovsky, Antonioni, Beckett, etc? A great big balloon of images with nothing inside, just like life itself. A masterpiece of muteness. Plus, if you wish, there's political significance, too, like Joseph Roth's novel _Radetzky March_ (or the excellent film version made in Austria in the early 60s)."
2,Geometry: An Integrated Approach (Teachers Edition),"The book does not contain detail as to how to solve geometry problems. Older texts, say from the 1950ies, do a much better job. The book contains puzzles, teasers, gemmicks and so on but not much in the way of problem solving. In addition to Older texts, Books that include Euclid's ""The Elements"" such the classic one edited by Sir Thomas Heath are excellent means of learning the basics of geometry, especially books, one, two, and three."
5,Jackpot!,"This must be a discontinued color (Caribbean) to be available at such a great price. For just $59 this beautiful, genuine Le Creuset cocotte is a perfect addition to my enameled cast iron collection. The size is perfect for side dishes or small casseroles and is a gorgeous shade of teal. Are there any more like it? I would buy them all."
2,Quality Issue,Functional but quality suspect - battery had a problem and expanded and the power interface broke after just a year
1,agitprop,"Vladimir Dedijer was a Bosnian-Serb, son of the influential Serb scholar Jevto Dedijer.Vladimir Dedijer was Central Committee member, Political Commissar and Agitprop Section Secretary of the ""Yugoslav"" Communist Party, besides Editor of ""Borba"", the official organ of the same party.Vladimir Dedijer was an ultra-Stalinist, but after 1948, he turned opportunistically into an ultra-Titoist and anti-Stalinist.Vladimir Dedijer was Tito's official biographer.Vladimir Dedijer was the creator of the ""700.000 killed in Jasenovac"", an absolute exaggeration because approximately 1 million (of all nationalities) died in the former Yugoslavia during War World Two and actually the official list in the camp today counts 69.842 names.So don't expect no bias in this book.The author HATED Croatian nationalism, HATED the Catholic Church but LOVED Communism... So you do the math."
1,A serbian attempt to change the subject.,"Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Mass Rape, Genocide, Ethnic Cleasning(which the Serbs invented), relocation, torture, and Massacre, the serbs have these things on their conscience. A book called ""Serbia's Secret War"" tells how this and other books try to shift the blame to the Croatians so that people will ""hopefully"" forget their atrocities. A sad attempt at most."
1,"There should be a ""zero star"" rating. This book qualifies!","This book should be called ""Serbian Lies and Historical Revisionism."" It makes me sick to my stomach to even write about this piece of trash.The figures of Serbian deaths have risen over the years from 100,000 to now over 1 million in some areas. The Serbian lobby and propoganda machine are still pumping away and the sad part is that people who don't know anything about this region or its history are buying this tripe hook, line and sinker with no other frame of reference. We waste time and natural resources in printing this garbage!Read a book called ""Operation Slaughterhouse."""
4,Well...,"It appears to me that this book indeed have credible facts in it. Many critic of this book are on two extremes, either they accept all the facts, or they are Croats who just dismiss the entire book simply because of how the ""facts"" portray what they did. It's quite pitiful when someone does this."
4,Croatian Shame,"This book sheds much needed light on a poorly understood chapter of Holocaust history. The genocide which took place in WWII Nazi Croatia was characterized by extreme brutality and hate against the pro-Allied Serbs. More than 700,000 died along with most of Croatia's small Jewish community. Croatia, with its newly won independence must confront its Nazi past and its horrific genocide against the Serbs in order to grow as a nation - rather than continuing with its crude Holocaust revisionism. A must book which should be in every Croat school and library."
1,Serbian propaganda,When you want to read about WWII in former Yugoslavia it's best not to read from authors from the area (Croatian or serb it doesn't matter). This book is no exception.
5,Sammo Hung's ultimate tour de force.,"Sammo Hung perfects the term ""non-stop action"" in this ...kicking, fire fighting, tree climbing, knife wielding adventure based on ""The Dirty Dozen"". Sammo and Yuen Biao demonstrate what skill is all about and manage to amaze without using a wire. Jackie Chan is the man, but his two buddies from school reign supreme in this film that Jackie wishes he would have thought of first."
1,Why One Star,"I love this movie and yes I have this copy. The Reason for 1 star is that they cut scenes that made this movie cool.I have the Original Laser disc copy and the reason I got this copy was the dubbing,(Which Sucks). HERE ARE THE SCENES THEY CUT OFF. They actualy cut of the Scene when Samo cuts the girls hand off.(I have a copy when it realy shows it comes off) Then the fight scenes was arange difffently. And they begining of the film has the flag pole scene cut off.And many more scenes ws remove. All I can say is that SHAME ON ON THIS PUBLISHER TO REDITED the movie.This sucks."
3,"Not a bad movie, but it could have been better","I remember seeing the TV comercials for this movie and thinking wow! Unfortunately, the movie didn't quite live up to expectations. I liked many elements of the movie: the premise (a team of Chinese convicts drops into 1976 Vietman to destroy a US weapons cache), the fight scenes. However, I hated the combat team that dropped in with Sammo Hung. These men are supposed to be hardened crimminals (like the dirty dozen), but during the movie they do nothing but cringe and whimper and act as comic relief. If one guy on the team was like that it would be okay, but to have an entire combat team made up of cowards ruins the movie."
1,Bad Movie,the only reason i rate the movie one because i cant give it a zeroworst movie ever madedont waste your money on it
1,No.,"Bad, bad, bad. Lame martial arts. The characters actually shout out ""gooks!"" at one point in the film. No joke. DON'T buy this."
1,Slow and Poorly done,Although it has a couple of good actors the movie itself was very poorly done with a lot of work needed on the speech syncronization. The action was slow and unrealistic.
5,Met her on a plane - bought her music!,Great tracks that allow a beautiful voice to come through. The lyrics are true to her heart and the music keeps you coming back. 'Santa Ana Winds' - my fav!Rock on ShijeCountry
2,Psych!,"This song was Shaquille O'Neal's biggest hit, but it's not really that good. But if you happen to like it, I'm not going to tell you not to buy it. Here is the track listing for the CD:1. ""(I Know I Got) Skillz"" (LP/Radio Version)2. ""(I Know I Got) Skillz"" (Remix)3. ""(I Know I Got) Skillz"" (LP/Radio Instrumental)4. ""(I Know I Got) Skillz"" (Remix Instrumental)5. ""What's Up Doc? Can We Rock"" (K-Cut's Fat Track Remix)"
1,IM NOT A WOMAN BUT I KNOW WHAT I WANT!!!,I WANT THIS TO STOP!! WHAT TOTAL CRAP!!! THE EUROPEANS LOVED THIS? THEY NOMINATED HER FOR AWARDS? WELL DONT FORGET THE EUROPEANS LIKE WOMEN WITH HAIRY LEGS AND ARM PITTS TO!!! LORENA RETIRE NOW AND GO OUT ON.......UH....TOP?!!
3,"An ok book, but lacks coherency","The first half of this book is really confusing. The reader will have a hard time trying to figure out what this book is about. Is it about philosophy? Neurology? Or is it a journal? Well, the book is a little of everything and this poses a great problem. It is a very short book and so I don't think that all the above can be included in it without having a negative effect on the book's clarity, which was the case here. Some of the cases mentioned in the book are really interesting, but it was disappointing to see that not much attention was paid to them because the author always seems to drift into a separate world. The book was saved by the last fifty pages where most of the ideas start falling together to build a more coherent picture. One of the best parts of the book was the extra readings section because the author mentions many books on the subject. I just hope that the books that he mentions are a little more focused than this book."
2,"A good casual read, not a lot of ""meat""","I expected this book to be a bit more scientifically oriented. I was disappointed to find that the author spends more time waxing poetic about souls, etc., than the nature of neuropsychology and related disorders. He sheds light on the hardships of dealing with patients as whole people, while being all too aware of their component parts. While I realize this is an issue for any kind of practitioner, I would have liked a bit more solid information on the nature of brain pathology.The author surely has a way with words, but often rambles for pages at a time. There is very little information on any given patient or case. The focus is usually on the author's experience doing his job.Overall, not an awful book. But as other reviewers have said, it could have used a bit more substance to balance the conjectures. Perhaps better for a casual reader than someone strongly interested in the field."
4,Foley tells a great story,"Mick Foley may not be Frost or Hemmingway or King or Patterson...but Scooter tells a great story.Again, Foley may not show up on any College Literature Course's required reading, but he has a knack for bring sincerity and believe-ability to a story when telling it from the point of view of a confused and angry teenager.He also offers many plot twists and revelations; most- I would bet - would be considered unpredictable by even the best-read fiction collectors.I wasn't pleased-to-death with the ending, but it hardly killed the story. The book had to end 'somewhere', and Foley did a fabulous job of wrapping things up and putting them away.If you like baseball, and can appreciate a story told from a teenager's point of view, you will very much enjoy 'Scooter'."
3,"Warm, Heavy on the baseball.","This book is a warm, relatively light read, but heavily references baseball throughout. If you aren't into baseball, which some find the most boring sport on earth, this tends to get in the way of the rest of the story."
1,What a Terrible Story!,"In order to tell a good story, an author has to know how to write. Unfortunately, Danny Simmons does not know how to write. He barely has a story to tell. He has thrown together stereotypical ideas of what urban life is and the people who live it. He uses every pararaph to conceal his insecurities by using large words and poetic phrases that do not pertain to the scene at hand. Talentless, boring, and uninventive- I pray that he does not come out with another one. The only thing impressive about him is his brother's money. And that is what probably got this supposed work or art published."
5,nice video,My oldest son loved getting this video for a gift. He watches it all the time. It was shipped as promised and it was as described in ad.
5,Absolutely splendid!,"This is music for people who like Apollo440, Massive Attack, Naked Funk and Chemical Brothers. A splendid mix of heavy beats with different oriental influences. Vocal work reminds me sometimes of Khaled while the female voice puts your right in the middle of magical incantations and more of those fantastic dreamy scenes.Specially Humanistic and 4 gone away won't be easy to forget and have a high recognisability value."
4,Kidnaped By Elsie Rawson,"A wonderful collection of short stories writen in a easy to read style. I enjoyed this book greatly, I really enjoyed the Snakes Alive and Ahmeeds Sacrifice. 128 pages seems small but its packed full. Easy to read fonts with not over sized font size but easy to read with a off white background, A must read"
1,The Numbers Don't Add Up!,"I bought this book based on many rave reviews by reviewers in the broadsheet newspapers. I have to say that this is the most disappointing book I have ever read. Yes there are some interesting sub-plots/stories in the book BUT in spite of the promise that it would all come together (add up) at the end it certainly didn't for me. I found myself getting closer and closer to the end WILLING the various stories to all come together for an impressive conclusion and was hugely disappointed with how it ended. It was like waiting for a big firework show's final explosions and, instead, there was a quiet phuuuutt of a damp banger! Sorry Mr Ings but in spite of the quality of the narrative in the various stories it led nowhere for me :-("
2,Not the same as the classic Florsheim I'm used to wearing,"Even though these shoes have the same model number and design I'm used to, the leather material and feel aren't the same. Too bad... I guess I'll have to look for a new shoe."
3,"This is a tourist phrase book, not a textbook.","This is a tourist phrase book pure and simple, but when it is offered online, and cannot be previewed, the title is apallingly misleading. It presents words and phrases in various categories, with Persian script, transliteration and English equivalent, as any good phrase book should. It will be of use to travelers and it can be used for additional vocabulary and examples of colloquial language by students who have mastered the elementary level of Persian.Sudents who want to learn Persian should look at the books by Wheeler Thackston, Serge Obelinsky, and Ann Lambton."
1,Good,"Well this is not a book to learn persian, but it is a book for turists who may wish to go to Iran."
1,So many mistakes!,"I speak persian, but I thought this book could help me broaden my persian vocabulary. EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER of this book is full of mistakes. They're not even minor mistakes; but obvious ones! The persian translation of many of the words in this book are COMPLETELY WRONG. This book is a complete waste of money and needs to go back to the publisher for major revisions."
3,THIS IS AN INFORMATIVE BOOK,I purchased this to learn more about the field I am in. Its thorough and easy to navigate.
1,Returned due to defect,Im sure these are pretty good lenses for the price but the lens I wanted to use(polarizer)arrived with a scratch right down the middle and a coating defect on the lens itself. I returned these and bought the zeikos lenses.
3,Not so bad but not as good as some other Indonesian exploitation movies,"Two sisters want to take revenge on Tiger, a crime boss who killed their parents and stole their house. They have gathered a group of biker chicks to join their cause. But not everything goes as planned and they end up Tiger's prisoners. And so, the movie turns into a women in prison-movie.The story is okay but not great, but there are lots of scenes that are hilarious. But the movie is a bit too long, which makes the pace too slow at times. Overall, not a bad movie, but I agree with the other reviewer who said this is not the best place to start if you're not acquainted with Indonesian exploitation films. There are better ones out there. And although I haven't seen all that many, I would recommend ""Mystics In Bali"", ""Lady Terminator"" or ""Dangerous Seductress"" before this one. Perhaps also ""The Devil's Sword"", which is hilarious at times but like ""Virgins from Hell"", somewhat suffers from an uneven pace."
1,Poop-ship destoyer,"Wow, what is there to say except wow. I like good movies. And I like bad movies. I did not like this movie."
3,The Rabbi,"I purchased this book because I could not put down all other books from Noah Gordon. However, while it appeared interesting I found it could not hold my attention and admittedly its still in my Kindle to be read completely. I am about three quarter through the book and I suppose I will finish it one of these days. To me it feels a bit like a let-down after all his other fascinating books."
5,The Rabbi by Noah Gordon,"Noah Gordon is a master story teller. I first read this book in the 1960s and was unable to trace it in the UK. The search via Amazon.com has been well worth it. Michael Kind, the eponymous rabbi matures with humility through his family,colleagues the various temple communities.What an insight too in to Jewish culture. Fabulous read.The Rabbi"
3,Dated novel with some lovely character descriptions,"The story of a young rabbi and his wife, who converts to Judaism to marry him, is told over three generations and the entire twenty year span of their marriage. Although the dynamics between husband and newly Jewish wife are what caused me to pick up the novel, it was the minor characters that kept me reading. I never warmed to Michael Kind or felt anything but mild sympathy for his wife, but I fell in love with the descriptions of old world Zaydeh; the plight of the unfulfilled chassidic child prodigy, Max Gross; and the dying young Dick Kramer. The short vignettes that describe these characters are gems in an otherwise dated novel of interfaith relationships in 1965."
4,a little outdated but still good,"I first read this book when I was a kid and recently re-read it. Much of the dialogue and beliefs seem outdated now, as ""The Rabbi"" was written 41 years ago, when the WWII generation was in charge of morality and interfaith marriage was considered daring and shocking. Noah Gordon understood human nature and wrote compassionately of the fears and failures we all experience in life. He lets us know what Leslie is thinking and feeling in a beautiful way that most male authors would be incapable of doing. He shows Rabbi Michael Kind as a loving but imperfect man who is forced to be strong for those who are weak--even though he himself has many moments of weakness and doubt. At age 14 this book touched my soul and taught me compassion. Decades later, it still does!"
4,A Good Read,A good read--an interesting and a good story---can learn something about the Jewish relegion and about Jewish life in general.
4,cool cuts,90's Soul took a major turn once R&B and Hip-Hop merged together but before that fully took place there were elements of the late 80's that carried over to the 90's and then you had other versatile styles that emerged as well. this is a good set that has songs which still hold up very well.
1,Oh what a piece of s.....,"First of all you need to carry a giant wrench along if you want to open the knob to wind new string on it. No way you can do that with your fingers alone! Second it has not two chambers: no matter how carefully you wind your string: it will knot, block and rip off. Third when you open it up in the field....pop goes the spring!

I am told the ss725r is better....but that comes with kit-and-kaboodle at 61 bux plus shipping!"
3,"Good book, bad format.","This is a very good study of the Westminster Confession and Catechisms. However, the binding is not really sturdy enough for frequent use, which hinders its use as a study guide. Also, the fact that the answers are in the back of the book limits its use in more formal classes. But the content is great."
4,Out in l.a. - essential RHCP,"Out in l.a. would be a welcome addition to any Red hot chili pepper fans collection. It is an unusual mix of demo tracks, remix's and live recordings, the amazing castles made of sand being among the latter. The title of this c.d. Out in l.a. is also the name of the chili's very first song which is a track well worth listening to along with the quirky Flea fly. In conclusion, anyone used to the bands brand of enthusiasm, origianality and talent will not be dissapointed with this 19 track disc."
2,"Not their best work at all, but...","...the live tunes are pretty good. Even though I am a huge fan of RHCP, save your money because $19.99 + tax ans shipping just isn't worth it for a couple of songs. My suggestion, buy the three or four MP3s that are worth your time."
4,Its Good Buy It,The only reason I wouldn't give this cd 5 stars is sound quality. The EMI people have made this cd nearly obsolete because they spread all of its tracks across the reissues. For the die hard Chili Peppers fan a must have.
3,"""What Maps Tell You""","This is an adequate introduction to maps for very young readers. But it does not go far enough. Early readers can grasp more. For example, instead of such large print, smaller print would make it possible to say moreon a page. The road map explanation could have told the reader about the road numbers and the rank of the roads. But, in fact, I would have first visited a neighborhood and a child's home (house or apartment), andincluded a school, grocery, church, etc. Manhattan is interesting but should come later. A world map shouldbe preceded by state, national, perhaps continental size maps. More than one map shows lines for boundariesbut no real comment on political maps and symbols. Overall, this little book could be more useful in helping young students get ready to read maps in class and in textbooks. But it is very limited even for the audience intended.

3,Cute book,"This book is ok, and cute, but the best one in the series to get is Tykosaurs. It's got the coolest dinosaur costumes and my son absolutely loves it!"
5,Great set-up,"I ordered this item so that I could take my Sirius out into my garage with me. The unit is very easy to install, and works like a charm. I would highly recommend this item to anyone thinking about buying one."
1,Crutchfield Sirius Satellite Radio Home Kit,"I chose Crutchfield because they were the only company showing that they still had this product. Well, not only was it backordered and not arrive for its intended gift date, it also wasn't the product listed. So now I have a credit to Crutchfield, not to Amazon, and have no desire to give the company my business."
3,"Five stars for concept, one star for practicality","""You wouldn't run a marathon without training for it; why would you give birth without training for it?"" As a marathoner, this philosophy appealed to me. But the ""maternal fitness routine"" takes ninety minutes. As a wife and working woman, I don't have a spare ninety minutes each day for all of these little lifts and squeezes and muscle contractions. Tupler's basic moves are good, and I do the kegels and abdominal holds every day at my desk. But I've had to abandon the ""routine"" in favor of my own half hour of daily exercise."
5,Excellent preparation for managing labor - it works!,"I purchased this book when I was three-months pregnant with my first child. I was able to do most of the abdominal wall and breathing exercises on my daily bus-ride to and from work. The visualization/mental exercises at the end of the book are also very beneficial. I had no epidural, no drugs, and my son was born after only four and a half hours of labor. The exercises really work!"
1,Kool N' Fit Pain Relieving,"I bought this product on the recommendation from someone else who liked it.I have arthritis in my knees and lower back. I put some of it on my back and legs and smelled like a mountain goat.It doesn't relieve the pain, but gives a temporary sensation of heat. I would not recommend it for arthritis, but maybe it would help with sprains etc. if you can get over the medicinee smell."
2,Not so great,"Totally agree with Jeanette.The warming sensation just temporarily disguises the pain and only for a short time.Very strong smell, also."
2,Nothing special,It's pretty much just Icy Hot in a spray bottle which I've never found to do much for me other than make me smell menthol fresh. It does dry without leaving a greasy residue.
3,Cute but quality challenged,This is a classic you get what you pay for. They are cute and your daughter will love them ... but they aren't very sturdy or well made. Disney definitely seems to aim for cheap with little kids stuff. The good news is kids will quickly outgrow these so maybe flimsy is ok.
4,Ashra - 'Black Outs' (Avalon) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1977, another good side-project from Ash Ra Tempel's main man, Manuel Gottsching. Liked this CD almost as much as I do any of the first,say five (5) Ash Ra Tempel albums. Tunes that tend to stand out are the intricately-played ""77 Slightly Delayed"", ""Midnight Oil"" and the seventeen-minute astounding ""Lotus, Parts 1-4"". 'Black Outs' seems to really showcase some truly beautifully performed 'new age / ambient' guitar work from Gottsching. On the right night, this music will have the hairs on your neck standing up. Might appeal to fans of Tangerine Dream, some Gong die-hards, Mike Oldfield and possibly King Crimson. Give this CD a chance. A should-have."
4,"Dreamy, trance-y","Dreamy, trance-y, bubbly. Percolating electronic ragas for guitar, synthesizer and drum machines. Perfect for chilling out, thinking, working, relaxing. Lots of small, incremental changes in timbre, melody and rhythm -- ever evolving. No track really stands out, they just flow into one another. The longest track, ""Lotus..."", has some dissonance/tension the others don't have.I also highly recommend ""New Age of Earth"" and, especially, ""Inventions for Electric Guitar""."
1,Won't stick,"This product states it ""Stays Longer! than ordinary corn cushions"" Well, not sure how long the ordinary cushions stay on, but this brand won't even stick. Pointless product! Going back to the store to try something different."
5,Great for runner's nipple chafing,I have been using these for a number of years to prevent bloody nipples after long runs. They work fabulously.
3,Guide to DVD,"Campbell's lectures on mythos are very informative and inspiring. This book gives you a written guide to the DVD. The publishing could have been better, mainly where images are printed."
5,love this show,"I love this Spanish drama show. I was planning to get this dvd soon. I wasn't planning to write a review on this show until I seen someone putting a bad review on this show. I must say this show is funny, dramatic, romantic, and bring back great memories. I will recommend this show to anyone. A word of advise its only in Spanish audio, but their's English subtle."
1,not highly recommended,"I borrowed this movie from Denver library and it turned out that this movie was a waste of time. I could not understand a bit what the point of this movie is. All I could get is that the main actor loved women very much. I like movies that deliver messages for its viewers, and this one is definitely a no no."
1,"Stale ideas, poor narrative, no substance","This book is nothing more than a blitzkrieg of common sense that often passes for ""insights and practices."" This vain attempt to provide a magic potion amounts to scatterbrain suggestions in the form of page fillers, weak narrative and prose, poor grammar, and incoherent organization of ideas.As another reviewer mentioned, the author seems to have written this book just for the sake of writing a book. He attempts to be Norman Vincent Peale, Dale Carnegie, Samuel Smiles, Steven Covey, Tom Peters, Napoleon Hill, and Peter Drucker in less than a hundred pages of content. His effort to join the guru industry simply lacks substance, rigor, or insightfulness. Two small paragraphs on improving communication skills? And both of these about pausing to look over an email before sending it?Unless you are a school kid willing to stomach grandpa's unexciting counsels on how to succeed in the world of work, you would avoid the book."
5,An Absolute 'MUST READ' book for every Technology Professional,"This is an absolutely wonderful book to read and if you follow through and implement all the ideas and exercises at the end of each chapter, you will be richly rewarded. This book is an easy read and when you are done reading it you will be left with a feeling that all the best ideas related to personal/career development have been distilled and put in a very practical mode. Every friend that I have recommended this book to (and has read it) has thanked me and let me know how great it was. That to me is the true test of a good book. This is a MUST READ for every technology professional who is serious about his/her career."
5,Simple but True!,"Rajesh Setty's ""Beyond Code"" is a deceptively simple prescription for getting out of the rut of today's complex workplace. As a career coach I see many clients, especially from high-tech who feel lost, stressed out, and hopeless. This simple book (not just for those from high-tech) can change their outlook on how they can learn to manage with what is already available to them in abundance: Their own internal resources! If those who feel ""unplugged"" in today's indifferent world, they can simply change their outlook by following the nine potent steps outlined and beautifully illustrated in Shetty's book! Bravo!Dilip SarafCareer and Life coach"
4,Beautiful Prose,"This novel is definitely not plot driven. However, for those of you looking for a book with exquisite writing then Housekeeping will not disappoint. Robinson demonstrates a superb command of syntax and rhythm in her writing. For example, describing the pond adjacent to the narrator's house, Robinson writes:""A narrow pond would form in the orchard, water clear as air covering grass and black leaves and fallen branches, all around it black leaves and drenched gress and fallen branches, and on it, slight as an image in an eye, sky, clouds, trees, our hovering faces and our cold hands.""Some of the passages were so beautifully written that I found myself reading quite a few out loud."
1,"If you like lots of water, no plot, and a lot of self importance, this one's for you","I read it and simply do not understand why people rate this book so highly. I felt like I was under a rain cloud, and I half expected mold to grow out of the pages. Everybody in this book is crazy except for Lucille, who makes the sensible decision to leave her delusional family and start a new life on her own. I wish the book followed her instead - she was the only one that showed any bravery and originality.The rest of the time, I'm assuming we're supposed to feel sorry for the crazy aunt and the other sister, who fall deeper and deeper into mental illness. Personally, I finished the book faintly disgusted by them both. I wish the author had invested a bit more grit and toughness into her characters, and a little less naval gazing."
1,A long and boring waste,"I can't believe people liked this writing. I need a period now and then. Long, rambling piles of meaningless words that lent nothing to the story. I wish it had been a library book instead of a waste of my Kindle selections."
5,"""What If Everyone Read The Same Book""","Housekeeping has been chosen for a project in Boise Idaho entitled: ""What If Everyone Read The Same Book."" Marilynne Robinson will be coming on September 14th and 15th to the Log Cabin Literary Center's BookFest to read and help promote city-wide discussions of the book. Housekeeping was chosen out of more than 100 title suggestions. A selection committee of 14 members spent three meetings totaling seven hours deciding on THE BOOK. The project was the brainchild of Dan Popkey a local newspaper columnist who will cover the progress and success of this city-wide book club in his column."
1,Best Housekeeping Tip: Avoid cluttering up your bookshelves with this one,The quality of writing wasn't the problem with Housekeeping. It was the quality of the characters. They just aren't very interesting because they're about as deep as a paper cut and reading about them is just as painful. I plan to do a little Housekeeping myself by placing this one directly into the trash.
1,Unfinished,"Am incredibly disappointed in this highly acclaimed novel. Self-indulgent, overwrought, and boring. I tried twice to read it, got to page 100 and couldn't go on."
5,"A silent, deeply moving book","The descriptions in this book are marvelous! A wonderful story of two sisters brought up by an eccentric aunt. The writing is so still, so wonderful, that i found myself feeling the mist off the lake, and seeing the stars out at night. A truly beautiful book!"
3,"favorite book, horrible voice","I LOVE this book. I've read it twice to myself and once aloud to a friend. I was elated to see it was in audioCD form so that I could listen to it in the car. But the voice who's reading this book really nearly ruins my favorite novel. She turns the characters into caricatures. She puts irony in a voice where there should be none, and forcefulness where there should be listlessness and wistfulness. She doesn't have a sense of the cadence of the sentences, and I actually think she doesn't know what some words mean. To her credit, she gets a little better as the book goes on. Still, what a disappointment. This book needs to be re-recorded with another speaker."
3,For many this will be a five star.,"I admire the book. Beautiful prose and complex characters. I just didn't enjoy it. The main character, who told the story, was ethereal; I prefer grounded characters. She described beautifully what was in her mind. I like to know the tangible and I prefer it described briefly and concisely, perhaps with wry or insightful comment on the part of the teller, but at most in a short paragraph. I was abashed to stumble on words through out the book for which I didn't know the meaning, but I didn't look them up because I just didn't care enough about what the author was saying. I would describe it as a really good plot buried in a sea of clouds. It seemed like a lot of work to dig out the substance."
5,Poetry,This book came with a boxfull I bought to follow along with the internet literature course provided by Yale. Picked it out of the pile because of the title ... I hate housekeeping. Spent yesterday sitting outside reading it. Pure poetry. Looking forward to reading all this author's books.
3,Housekeeping,I read it for book club which is probably the only reason I finished it. Too much gloom and doom for me. If you are an amateur psychologist you might find this interesting.
3,A book best appreciated but not so much enjoyed,"Marilynne Robinson is an exquisite writer, there's no denying it. However, as beautiful as her writing is, it doesn't translate (to me) to an enjoyable story, and I as a reader need more than pretty words to keep me turning pages. As other reviewers mention, not remotely a plot-driven novel. Nothing wrong with that, just not for everyone. It becomes sort of a chore to read after a while.I'd say the same thing about Gilead."
2,too slow,"""The air filled with dust particles that looked like tiny bent threads, or hairs, which someone had once told us were atoms.""Brilliant writing? I find it excruciating."
3,Not as good as Gilead,"After reading Gilead, I was looking forward to another one of Marilynne Robinson's novels. I was disappointed. This is a story about how two young girls grow up after their mom's death. Abandoned to their elderly grandmother and a series of other relatives, you do not develop any strong feelings for these girls. I was surprised how little I cared. Ms. Robinson keeps you fairly distant from them despite their pretty awful predictment. However, the minor characters were pretty quirky and interesting."
3,It is definately worth a read,"This book is very pretty. Robinson gets a gold medal in terms of technique, language, meaning, poetry,depth, and general ""prettiness."" It is excellent writing... it is great writing, in fact, but it is neither daring nor innovative nor fresh nor exciting. But I don't think it was meant to be any of those things, nor does it have to be.This book will never be a literary great.But it is very pretty and very well done."
3,"Excellent story, but......","I really like the characters in this book (in particular Sylvie), and must admit I read the book only after having really loved the movie adaptation. I have started and stopped this book repeatedly. I find much of it totally incomprehensible. Although I am drawn to the characters and the story, much of the imagery and Biblical references and poetic rambling may as well be written in a foreign language. I like a challenging book sometimes, but preferably one that I can eventually understand."
3,"Beautiful, Dreamy Novel","Marilynne Robinson's magnum opus, ""Housekeeping,"" is the story of two sisters, Ruth and Lucille. Abandoned by their mother, their care is passed through the family tree until their care finally becomes the responsibility of their eccentric aunt, Sylvie. The two sisters, once joined in their abandonment, begin to drift apart. Lucille, distancing herself from Sylvie's reputation, and Ruth, spiraling further downward into Sylvie's eccentricity.The only way I know how to describe this novel is like a dream done in water colors. ""Housekeeping,"" had a dreamy, outside-of-reality quality. Beautiful and heartbreaking, I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for a novel that is a break from the ordinary."
3,beautiful prose but....,"Housekeeping did not grab me the way Gilead did. (It would be unfair to compare but I had such high expectations after reading Gilead) Firstly Ruthie's story was so sad without being uplifting and in the end ,left me feeling very empty. Then the matter of ""water, water everywhere"" metaphor,issues of loss and abandonment , I found rather tiresome and repetitive . For me the saving grace was Ms.Robinson's undoubtedly evocative prose - it's lyrical, melancholic and breathtakingly beautiful. I can see that most reviewers have applauded this book, stating it as a classic..... perharps it's just me... i don't quite get it."
2,"Actually, kind of boring","The language used to tell this story was at times compelling and beautiful, but the plot and the general pace of the book were lugubrious and sluggish. There are enough books out there with both powerful prose and a strong story line - I say skip this one and try Faulkner or The Hours instead for a beautiful book. I took everyone's suggestion and bought it and was disappointed."
5,An English Language Gem,"The language of this first novel is amazing. The word picture that Ms Robinson paints is breathtaking and left this reader in awsome wonder. The prose takes on a near-poetic feel in the hands of the author. The story itself is simple, with more than enough bitter-sweet tragedy to move the most stolid of composures. Ruthie, the narrator of this tale, guides us through two generations of tragic misadventures. Only Lucille, younger sister of Ruthie, is able to outdistance herself from what seems to be a family touched with an overwhelming propensity to be out of step with those around them. The girls, left orphans at an early age, are eventually left in the care of their Aunt Sylvie who turns out to be as much of a child-like figure as the girls themselves. I am if left wondering if Fingerbone is Pend Oreille?"
3,Good but slow,"I found this book on my book club reading list and wanted to give it a try. As wonderful as this story is, you must have a long time to read this book. It will start off very quickly and it seems to be moving right along. Next thing you know it has been weeks and you can't seem to finish the chapter. I have been told by other people who have read this that it has happen to them. You find yourself slowing down to the pace of the story. If you have the time to read ""Housekeeping"" do it, otherwise wait until you have the time."
1,Didn't like it,I found the book to be very hard to get into and was hoping as I got more into it that it would get better. It didn't. The author is very expressive but I found that sort of annoying as I glossed over a lot of the flowery words to get to the real story and didn't really find it. There was no real explanation as to why this family ended up being the way they were.
1,A read that just plods along,"I too am among the ones who fail to see this novel's greatness. I never felt engaged with the characters, and the plot drags along without ever really going anywhere, just moving from one heavy, depressing scene to the next. I'm guessing this was the author's intent because it does reflect the overall somber mood that follows the main characters' lives -- a little too well. To me, there's a lot of ""fancy language"" and prose involved (better suited for poetry, really) but it just seems like good ""skin"" with no bones underneath. None of it actually says much of anything.I really enjoyed Robinson's ""Gilead"" and had high hopes for this one too, but for me, it really missed the mark."
4,Challenging -- good choice for book discussion groups,"The language is beautiful and the imagery poetic. And then I would stop and wonder where I was! Oh yeah -- with sad little girls attempting to grow up in a crazy world (or perhaps I should say ""with"" crazies!). But then the reader discovers that in the end what seems sad isn't sad at all. Well at least not for Ruthie. But on second thought -- maybe it is! And there perhaps is the strength of the story.The book though proving to be a challenging read, does make one think. And in discussing it with others I found not every one agrees about what Robinson is trying to say. Certainly the power of abandonment and its consequences comes through. It is the story's themes and the ambiguity of the ending that which makes HOUSEKEEPING a good choice for book discussion groups!"
3,Read Gilead First,"I would highly suggest reading Robinson's other fiction work first. This book is very slow. The pace set does not pick up throughout the book and while the writing is lovely, beautiful in fact, some might not respond well. If you are used to reading fast books, especially fiction/mystery, you may have a hard time with the sentences that take an entire page, with the adjectives that carry on and on as your eyes droop and grow weary with the passing of the sun over the sky. (if you happen to think that I should have just said 'it reads slow' this may not be your book). I HIGHLY recommend reading Gilead first which does have more of a substantial ""plot"" in my opinion and believable characters, deeper characters. If you love Gilead than this book will be awesome. The writing is poetry. Just slow poetry."
3,That's all there is,"I agree with every other 3 star rater here. They are spot on. I will reiterate the writing/prose was very good, but towards the middle of the book I realized that's all there is. The story was not interesting and the characters even less. I finished it and was glad to be done with it...like I'm glad to be done with my own housekeeping every Saturday morning."
3,Couldn't quite connect,"I picked up this book at my library because the author's subsequent book Gilead was memorable for me. Gilead started off very slowly. But it was apparent that every word was carefully crafted. And in the end, I thought it was rather a miracle of fiction.So I set off reading Housekeeping expecting the same kind of slow, miraculous revelation.Housekeeping had passages of unbearable beauty, some of them tying back to the Bible and other ancient themes of loss and self-realization. But in the end, I just didn't connect to these characters. It all felt like fable or myth without some essential connection to my own humanity.Honestly, I was happy when I turned the last page. A lot of the writing is quite gorgeous, but I am sorry to say that although I tried (reading and re-reading many of the passages) I couldn't consistently relate to the human situation that was depicted."
1,I found that reading this book took great effort.,"I found this book to be tedious, wordy and above all boring. I never connected with the characters. What happened to the three daughters of the grandmother? What went so wrong? The author does not give any background to understand or sympathize with the transient traits. It certainly is a vocabulary builder and the description of the setting was well done. I wouln't recommend this to anyone."
1,Nothing happens,"I read about half the book and nothing happened. Robinson's writing is intense and lyrical but also boring. It just went on and on and on and on...This is an extremely slow moving book, I was waiting for the plot to develop but it seemed like much of the book was the backstory. Don't waste your time."
1,200 pages of rambling drivel.,"Oh, good Lord, thank you baby Jesus this crappy book is over. I tried to read this POS 4 times last summer, and was never able to get halfway through the first chapter. This book reads like a babbling menopausal woman so hormone addled she doesn't know when to shut up.""As she knelt in the rows she heard the hollyhocks thump against the shed wall.""If lines like that get you off, this is just the thing for you, because the whole damn book is like that. Boring, plodding, tedious, it goes nowhere, and takes forever to get there."
2,Plot Without Hope;but excellent use of Grammar,"3/21/05 Was amazed at the ""imagery and poetic uses for the English Language""...Was not impressed with the tale which dwelled on death and failure throughout the novel .The good news is although its main characters were two young girls, there is enough 'taboo on various subjects' to make it unacceptable for the school libraries."
2,Disappointing Translation to CD,"I got this book because I enjoyed the author's recent book -- Gilead. Housekeeping may be a fine novel, but it is poorly rendered as an audiobook. I stopped listening about 1/3 of the way through."
2,zzzzzzzz,"i know there are many glowing reviews of this book, but mine will not be one of them. i agree ms. robinson certainly knows how to turn a phrase and can go on and on with her symbolic, lyrical descriptions. i had to force myself to slow down when i read 'housekeeping,' which i thought was a good sign. at first. any book that makes you slow down and pay attention deserves high marks. but i also had to force myself to finish it. there is too much flowery description and not much else. it is a very slow, stagnant, depressing story. by the last few chapters i was skimming like mad, because i had been depleted of patience to follow a story that HAD no story."
2,Pretty language but couldn't stay awake,"This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences. That's about all it is. Pretty, well constructed sentences. The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake. The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered.At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told."
4,Hopeless Housekeeping,"Marilynne Robinson writes beautifully and so wonderfully descriptive that you feel inside the main character--the barren cold, the freezing rain, the decrepit house--you share them all. An odd story, however, and in the end you feel completely empty."
5,Haunting and Cold,"The characters are haunting. The lives and limits of Ruth and her family are oppressed in the remote town their grandfather chose for the family before tragically abandoning them with small town infamy, sorrow, and unanswered questions. Themes of redemption and loyalty, make it clear that Ruth was appropriately named by her mother.The writing is chilling. The description of the environment is effectively and relentlessly freezing cold. At times it reminded me of the Shipping News or the Shining with the ability to feel the extreme weather and implied relationship with the development of the characters.It is a beautiful and poetic book but the beginning is very slow and sure to lose some readers. I was frustrated and moved by the sadness, and occasionally laughed out loud. The part about transience was new to me and I had trouble connecting but it was interesting and I continue to reflect on it weeks after finishing the book."
1,Overrated,I felt water-logged after reading this tedious book. Actually I wish I had drowned so I wouldn't have had to finish reading it.
2,Housekeeping - Marilynne Robinson's first novel,"This strange novel concerns two young girls, Ruth and Lucille orphaned by the death of their mother and then their grandmother. Eventually their aunt, Sylvie, moves in to provide adult presence in the household. Sylvie is a wanderer who ""sleeps with her shoes under her pillow"" and her head at the other end of the bed. She allows the girls to be truants. While Lucille begins to realize she needs to move away from Sylvia and finds a new home with a teacher, Ruth is more influenced by her Aunt Sylvie. Her life becomes more disorganized as she and Sylvie begin traveling first locally and then further away. This is a haunting tale."
1,nothing happens!!,"i found this book very tedious and difficult to read. marilynne tobinson's writing is beautiful and her manner of describing people and places was lovely, but it was over -internalized. The book just had too much of what was going on inside the characters heads and hearts and not enough of what was behind all of this existential agnst. i kept waiting for some kind of plot to develop. and what finally did happen was almost too eerie and bizarre to feel like real activity. being inside the minds of these characters was a bit like the feeling you have when you've taken too much cold medication."
1,Tedious,"I read another book by the the author, Gilead. I thought it was great book and wanted to read more books by this author.I found this book very difficult to read. The plot goes nowhere. Suicide, death, and insanity is the main focus. I was relieved when I finished the book and found it very depressing."
2,lovestoread,"I agree wholeheartedly with one of the previous reviewers-- beautiful use of the English language but no plot. I also tried to read Gilead and came to the same conclusion. I am not really into stream-of-conciousness type of writing, such that I cannot find the story line. I feel cheated because the author clearly has a wonderful command of the English language and I love the way she plays with words. I felt like I was reading poetry, but nevertheless the books she has written don't hold my attention and I can't seem to stick with them. I wish she could use her writing talents in a way that could keep the reader more involved in the story line AND enjoy her use of the English language at it's best."
2,This edition is an act of violence against a great book,"First, this is a great book--without doubt one of the most beautifully written books ever. I first read it from the library not long after it came out, and bought this copy so I could re-read it over and over. The writing is even better than I had recalled. BUT, this edition looks like a bad photocopy of something that was typed on an old typewriter with a dried out ribbon and some crooked letters. Perfection is not necessary, but the quality of this imprint is so bad that it's distracting from the reading. Picador should be embarrassed to have their name on it, and Marilynne Robinson should sue. If you're going to read the book, get a different edition."
2,disappointing,"I read this novel after having been blown away by Gilead and Home. What a disappointment Housekeeping was! It was one of those books where you begin to wonder if you're not ""deep"" enough for the quality of the literature, and then you just thank God that you're not insane. I can't see anything in this novel that sufficiently redeems the depression inflicted on the reader."
5,One of the best novels I've read,"Such good writing -- makes you envious the whole time: ""Will I ever be able to write like this?"" And you keep reading for the depth and crispness.Quote: ""Of my conception I know only what you know of yours. It occurred in darkness and I was unconsenting."""
5,brilliant,"a brilliant, intense and all-out novel about god (in the figure of a cold black lake) and the soul. beautiful, scary, extraordinary book, sui generis."
5,Works for me!!,"I suffer from a bothersome scalp condition known as folliculitis as well as ""growing dandruff"". When I had an outbreak, itchy bumps pop up in my scalp and sometimes crust over, forming scabs. The topical solution they prescribed me is not covered by my insurance so I would have to spend $90 out of pocket every 2 weeks to purchase it. Looking for a cheaper alternative, I came across Organic Root Stimulator at a beauty supply store and decided to try it. 2 years later, I'm very glad I did. Not only does this product keep my scalp aerated, healthy, dandruff and scab free, it also helped my hair grow tremendously. My hair went from just below chin length to the middle of my back. I get compliments everywhere I go on the length and health of my hair, even from the hairdresser who trims it every six weeks. When I go in beauty supply stores women ask what I use to keep my hair so healthy and I immediately point them to the Organic Root Stimulator section."
2,Hmm...,"I've used this product every week for around a month, (mainly around my edges) and I didn't really notice a change in my hair growth. I'm a huge fan of Organic Root Stimulator's products, but this one didn't do it for me.I love how it smells and I love the texture, but that's about it. It didn't really assist in my hair growth and now I have to find an alternative for my edges."
1,Waste of time and energy,"This product does not work. It just dries out your scalp and makes it itchy, which creates more flakes. I do not recommend this product at all."
3,Seeing no immediate difference,"I havnt been using the product regularly. However I have not seen any difference in the amount of dandruff. The main reason I bought this was to clean and hydrate my scalp. It seems like a good idea, but it did not give me the results i was looking for. I will continue to use it and if there are any changes I will offer an update."
3,based on truth,"It may sound weird, especially if you have seen this movie, but it was based on an experience that Dan Aykroyd actually had once when traveling. I doubt the real experience was this friggin strange, tho."
3,Cute Comedy,"It never ceases to amaze me how people can bother writing a long, overly-intellectual and overly-analyzed review of a movie that was never made to invoke either intellectual stimulation or deep analysis. It was never intended to be uproariously funny. I grew up watching this movie as a kid and my siblings and I loved it and so I could be 80 years old and this film will always hold a special place in my heart. Whenever I am in the mood for a very light and meaningless movie, I can pop this in and I am satisfied. Never in a million years would I consider this a quality film nor am I foolish enough to hold it to other quality films. However, it's a cutesy sort of movie and I enjoy seeing the big name actors acting silly. Take the movie for what it's worth. This isn't worth much at all, but that is the exact reason as to why we shouldn't be taking it so seriously. Watch it...get a chuckle or two and leave it alone."
2,Hot Dogs,"I will give this movie two stars because of the scene with the hot dogs. I cannot believe that anyone would give ""nothing but trouble"" five stars. Did they watch the entire movie? I will say that if you have never seen this movie, rent it, or wait for it to come on Comedy Central, because it is a spectacle to watch and you will form an opinion of it after watching it. I can also (I have never tried this) but I just thought of it: I'll bet this would be one of the funniest movies to watch if you were stoned."
3,A Must See ONCE...,"This movie is a great first time view, because you are kept wondering WHAT THE H@LL COULD HAPPEN NEXT. John Candy plays a very unusual roll, and the rest of the cast just kinda follow that same path. Worth a look..."
3,Rural Realism,"The humor in this movie lies in the realism of living in a rural community. ""Fact is stranger than fiction"" is the rule that dictates the means of justice in our rural community. Just be careful when you go passing through our neck of the woods."
1,Possibly the worst movie ever made,"Purely mindless, but not even in a funny way. The plot, characters, and jokes were awful. If you want to spend a rainy afternoon with a silly movie, try something like Dumb & Dumber or maybe Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. At least the jokes in those movies have punchlines.Leonard Maltin called this movie ""Stupefyingly unwatchable"" and I agree."
1,Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad,Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad BadBad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad and awful.Really. I'm not kidding
1,Horrible Movie,"This is one of the worse movies ever and I really can't believe that these great stars are in this movie. I liked it when I was younger but once I've re-watched it I realize why my parents despise this movie. Even though it has some stuff not for kids, I think kids will enjoy this title more then adults."
4,"Very weird, but still hilarious film!!!","Normally I don't like Chevy Chase or Demi Moore all that much, but this one was the exception! There were times this film was brilliant in its strangeness, but other times it was less so --- like the John-Candy-in-drag scenes, which were just stupid. Dan Ackroyd carried this movie with his portrayal of ""the judge"" --- who has to be seen to be believed! One of the strangest characters ever created for film!"
1,Worst movie ever!,"Why on earth anyone involved actually went through with making this movie is beyond me. I generally can go for dark humor. This movie is not funny, nor believable, nor redeeming in anyway. As the movie unfolds, rather than laighing at the strange characters presented, I was put off by some of the bizarre twisted portrayals.I suspect someone got a speeding ticket in a small town and wrote this to rant and rave and make a statement about it. Save your money! Rent it first if you must before blowing any more money on this stinker."
1,I paid to watch this?,"If you are a movie fan this one rates right up there. However, ""there"" is on the list of all-time worst movies. The only thing amazing about this film is how a good cast can make such a terrible film. Don't waste your time on this one. By the way, I gave it one star because there was no choice lower than that!"
3,Interesting . . .,"I picked it up because of the cast. I only gave it three stars because, while it does have its moments, I found it a bit wierd. John Candy was very good in both his roles. I didn't really get the point of Bobo and Lil' Debbul, but I liked the scene where they were playing cards with Demi Moore, who was pretty good. I'd give this one a B - B-. They did try."
3,If you simply want a silly comedy...,"Lots of people say that this movie is unwatchable, and even the worst movie ever made. I don't agree. I found it quite entertaining.However, before deciding whether to see this movie or not, ask yourself if you're in the mood for a totally silly comedy, with no depth at all. If you are, why not see it. It has no depth, it's just silly, and it's no advanced humor at all, but it's entertaining to watch, especially if you're tired or bored. It's even sillier than movies like ""Dumb and Dumber"" (but not quite that good). I wouldn't say it's worth buying, but if you're curious to see what you think, if only to get yourself an own opinion on this movie, rent it."
3,Over The Top,"I liked a lot of things about this film:1) It's the most engaging role Chevy Chase has ever played. In virtually ever other movie, he plays a doofus stumblebum loser - almost intolerable to watch. In this movie, he's adept, professional, and likable. How refreshing!2) Demi Moore is great in this film! How delightful to see her do something other than misty-eyed melodramatic claptrap. Demi, you are welcome on my beamer any day of the week. Since we're neighbors, let's be friends!3) The art and sets are fantastic!It may be that a significant portion of the movie-viewing public relies on suspension-of-disbelief to enjoy a film. This probably isn't the right film for that. On the other hand, if you can enjoy a movie that is a great mix of writing, acting, directing, and producing - and complete creative nonsense - this movie is perfect."
4,A Good Movie,"I have to say that this was a good movie. It did have good funny jokes. One of the amazing parts of this movie is that some of the actors in this movie also played more than one person. That's what made it interesting. The acting was great and the storyline actually made sense. Chevy Chase and Demi Moore were the absolute best. Dan Aykroyd also played a couple of very important roles in the film. This was a very good Chevy Chase movie, buy it."
3,Must See,Granted I like some bombs and this has the label. Aykroyd is excellent as the Reeve and Lil Devil while John Candy is likewise as the cop and his own sister. Demi Moore is never bad for the eyes and the Brazillianaires very entertaining. While you could never call it a great film it was a lot of (mindless) fun to watch and watch again (later).
5,If you liked Beetlejuice...,"I was enjoying the beginning of this movie and once Chevy Chase and Demi Moore entered what I'll describe as a little corner of the world that has a Beetlejuice type atmosphere to it, I really fell in love with it. There's alot of wackiness and creativity in it, John Candy plays 3 different roles very well. Dan Ackroyd was great as J.P., who ran the show in this wacky little town. Demi Moore's role didn't really give her a chance to shine, perhaps more could have been done there with the writing of her role. I really liked this movie, it's funny and as I say if you appreciate the humor of a movie like Beetlejuice, I think you might get a real kick out of this one. I watched it for free as an Amazon Prime member but liked it so much, I think I'll buy it on DVD."
3,Collector Item,"Just a small piece of footage of ""Digital Underground"" with Tu Pac Shakur as an up and coming artist."
1,So Awful it's hysterical,"This movie is just loaded w/stars, and I am willing to bet this is the worst movie that Demi Moore, John Candy, Dan Akroyd, and Chevy Chase ever made. I honestly find it hard to believe that someone spent money to produce this thing. If you want something out of the ordinary, this movie is for you. If you want to see just how bad a movie can be, this movie is for you. I will have to admit, I haven't laughed so hard in a long time, but it wasn't becuase it was funny."
5,Dan Aykroyd is a Genius!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For someone to say they DID NOT Like this film is close-minded and boring. My finance and I found it extremely funny. And the Fart Scene was amazing. You have to admit once in a while you fart too. ...I give it 5 stars and then some. Im so hungry I want a hotdog. Police car had style. Disney should have that rollercoaster! CHOMP! So have some fun in life and laugh at the bizarre. afterall, its the bizarre thats making millions."
3,All I Can Say Is Not So Good,"You would think with John Candy and Dan Aykroyd in it,it would be pretty good.It turned out it wasn't that good as you would expect. I would forget this one,its just boring."
1,Beneath the Bottom of the Barrel,"Absolutely one of the worst movies ever made--even condensed to a five minute skit--it would have been insufferable.The ""comedy"" isn't funny--despite the high profile cast--and even though it may not sound like much--it delivers even less.Anyone who recommends this movie must own shares of it. Avoid--even if you find it in a bargain bin. The only thing this dvd is good for is to use as a coaster"
1,THE WORST FILM EVER MADE. It's that simple.,"All that I'm going to say about this 'film' other than what the title of this review has implied, is that there is absolutely nothing in this film that qualifies as something redeemable. It is wholly bereft of anything that resembles comedy, talent, or taste. When I saw this film, honestly, after it was over, I felt physically ill. Yes, it's that bad. And it apparently can be hazardous to your health. Avoid it at all costs."
1,Probably the worst movie I have ever seen...,"I must warn anyone out there actually considering this movie: it is so bad that even though there are some 5-star reviews, the possibility of any sane human being liking or even being able to sit through is highly, highly unlikely. It is worse than bad; it eventuates in that strange and almost surreal feeling that a part of your life is lost and never to be recovered again. It is so bad that you can't even begin to seriously analyze it, so I won't try. I will simply do my duty as a socially responsible citizen and spend five minutes of my time to try and save you ninety of yours."
1,A thunderstorm movie!,"This is the only movie we have ever walked out of. It should get a -5 rating. As we were watching this film there was a loud thunderstorm going on outside that was providing better entertainment than the piece of trash we were watching. From that day forward we referred to all really bad movies as ""thunderstorm movies"". I have watched many films over the years that were a million times better that never made it to VHS or DVD. Go figure."
4,I found this movie downright hilarious,"This movie is very funny with Dan Aykroyd's screwball lines like ""...Like a bunch of spiders in a birthday cake!!!"".This is my favorite comedy besides Happy Gilmore."
1,Should have NO stars--Should OWE us stars,"Life is too short to waste even an hour of it watching this movie. I can't think of a worse one. It's not even bad in an amusing way--and I like a lot of bad and odd movies. No. I saw it 10 years ago and thoughts of it still make me feel sick, sick to my soul, sick of the world. No no no no no no no!"
1,Incredible waste of cast and flim,"Like a lot of others, until I saw this movie I would not have believed that a movie with this cast could have missed so greatly. The first half hour was interesting, but it really goes downhill fast. Only Ackroyd or Candy movie I know of that I didn't think was at least pretty funny."
4,Funny,"I saw this movie back when I was young. All I could remember about it is that it was gross. I watched it again on dvd years later and it wasn't bad. I remember what I thought was so gross. The scene at the dinner table grossed me out. Watching the judge with his penis nose try to eat a hot dog. I can laugh about it now, but eeww before lol."
1,There cannot be this many people who like this...,"I am a fan of B Movies and actually enjoy many bad movies but this is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. It is stupid, boring and flat out a beating to watch. Sadly, I saw it in the theater and I saw it again recently. It still sucks. There was nothing amusing about this.I recall seeing it in the theater and watched no less than a dozen people walk out. I am sad that I did not... I was too cheap to walk out of a movie I paid to see. I actually expected it to get better... After all, it had to but no. At least it was consistent, it started bad and stayed bad."
1,One of the worst movies made -- ever,"The characters are contrived, shallow and crude. But besides that, it isn't funny."
1,Yup ... It BLOWS!,"I watched this movie five years ago and it still rates as the worst movie I have ever seen. It remains a running joke with my wife and I.I recommend it to people who *think* they have seen a bad movie. Until you have watched ""Nothing But Trouble"", you have not experienced the worst.I am considering owning this movie just so I can torture people by loaning it to them as a practical joke."
2,don't be fooled,"i made two mistakes i listened to my girlfriend who said this was a good movie and i was like wow chevy chase, dan aykroyd, and john candy they are funny this movie must be pretty good. well it doesn't overly suck but its not good don't spend more then 5 dollars on it because anymore then that is a total waste of money"
3,EEEH,THIS MOVIE WAS A GIFT FROM A FRIEND. I ACTUALLY HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BUT I CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT. I DO LOVE 80S DEMI
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"Are you guys insane?I'm a fan of Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd and John Candy. When these actors have/had a good script, they could be very funny. In fact, a lot of my favorite movies have one of the three. This is why I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it can out on video years ago. My brother and I rented it, and proceeded to laugh not once during this worthless excuse for a movie.This is one of those movies that you just look at the other person watching it and shake your heads in disbelief. I have no idea who thought this movie would be good, but everyone involved in it should apologize. In fact, the only reason to own this movie is to laugh at how bad it is."
1,"Abomination, Atrocity...that's just the A's....","I happened on this movie on cable about halfway through. It was so stupefyingly awful, so devoid of any humor, so wasteful of an until-then talented cast--that I had to see the first half in order to see if there was even ONE SINGLE MOMENT of genuine entertainment. Two days later, I saw the first half. Good Lord, what were they thinking? Did the studio exec who greenlighted this heinous monstrosity find something funny here? Do movie people really suspect life outside of L.A. is like this? I've tried to understand how things like this happen. I don't know. I give this movie five squating dogs and a bewildered groan. A new mystery: the good reviews on here for this. Are they 7 years old? Have they sustained head injuries? Please, someone help me understand...."
3,A totally quirky movie,"I loved this movie from the moment I first saw it. I've had friends totally change their opinion of me (for the worst) after they find out it is one of my all-time favorites. Totally quirky, undescribably insane."
1,Celluloid as Industrial Waste,"Dan Aykroyd's only directorial effort is a genuine stink bomb. ""Nothing But Trouble"" finds a good cast wallowing in the New Jersey mire. Rarely has a comedy been so relentlessly unpleasant. (Incredibly enough, the original 1990 edit was even worse.) Aykroyd buries himself under tons of grotesque makeup, but fails to camouflage the sheer awfulness of this vanity production."
4,what is the deal with the low reviews?,To start the movie throws you for a loop. I dont know a ton about the back story on this movie but the number of sets and props is amazing. The plot of Chevy taking Demi to NJ is a little thin and getting stuck is a little out there. Remembering this movie is from 1991 is the key. Its hokey and wonky in all the right ways. The acting is a bit ham handed but the costumes are top notch. I was glad to see that some some sub plot was present at the comedy pops off the screen. Buy this movie at a decent price and you'll be pleasantly pleased. Did I mention that Tu Pac is in it wearing a NY Yankees jersey? The music is top notch and bring a nugget of hip hop back to life. A must have for classic comedy collectors and hip hop fans.
1,awful,Stupid movie. The only funny part was Dan Akroyd's character's Nose. Don't waste your time or your money. Not worth either!
5,Perfect!,Ordered movie two days ago and it already came in :) super happy!!! Movie came nice and clean and very well taken care of!
3,Pointless Release,"I am wondering why this is being released. The complete live action series has been released over 4 season sets and Season 1 volume was released separately last year. The complete animated series minus the episode ""The Shoe Must Go On"" was released as bonus features in the season sets. The description does not mention any bonus features so I would recommend the season sets. If this set contained the Punky Brewster cartoon ""The Shoe Must Go On"" then I would buy it for the episode that Shout Factory did not release in their box sets."
3,dvd is faulty,"It would only play the first 3 shows otherwise it was nice to show my daughter some of my childhood memories, and instill a good lesson thats lost these days of little girls can dress different and funky (not trashy) and still be spunky and fun!"
3,Smiley Smile,"For the casual Beach Boys listener, this album will largely sound incomplete and underproduced, with the obvious exception of the two radio songs, ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes & Villains."" Most of the songs retain very simplistic music tracks (in contrast to the fine-polished production of their radio hits and previous albums). So, if you're looking for the Beach Boys' acclaimed surf-music sound, don't start here. But if you're wanting to take a trip into Brian's mind during the late '60s, here's a good introduction."
4,A mere shadow of Smile,"I enjoy Smiley Smile fairly well, but it's still a mere shell of what Smile could have been. Were it not for Mike Love's impudent meddling and Capitol's pressure, Brian Wilson would have created a masterful album. Instead, we have to contend with Smiley Smile. It's a good album in and of itself, but it still lacks the dynamism of Smile. ""Wonderful,"" for example, was far more powerful and dynamic when it was Brian singing instead of Carl whispering. Also, ""Fall Breaks and Back to Winter"" was what was left of ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow,"" in which case the latter was again superior to the former. Thirdly, ""Heroes and Villains"" could potentially have been a full-blown musical collage, but it was shortened and butchered just to satisfy Capitol's greed. Granted, the Smiley Smile version is still enjoyable, but it would have been inifnitely greater in its original Smile form. All in all, Smiley Smile is a nice, laid back album, but it will forever be in the shadow of Smile."
3,Um...,"On the superb ""Good Vibrations"" box set, you can hear some of what should have been. Following the collapse of the brilliant ""Smile"" project, the Beach Boys retreated to a home studio, smoked some hash, and did sparse, messed-up versions of a few ""Smile"" songs, plus a few new ditties, supposed to be funny but really just odd or cloying. This album is mostly worth owning for the inclusion of the hit singles ""Heroes and Villains"" and ""Good Vibrations""."
1,What is this mess?,"Whoa! What is this? This is such a half baked effort, it makes me question why Capitol would ever release it. This has got to be, along with Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"" and Elvis Presley's ""Having Fun With Elvis On Stage"", one of the worst releases, ever, by a major artist on a major label.If you're of the ""It's-so-bad-it's-got-to-be-good"" school, this Cd will dissapoint you too. It's so bad, it's bad! You'll have to actually hear it to believe it, but I wouldn't reccomend even that.""She's Going Bald"" is the worst offender. ""Little Pad"" runs a close second.I love ""The Beach Boys"". Do yourself a favor and buy ""Friends"" or ""20/20"" or ""Holland""- pass on this."
4,Nice,"I got this because I get sick of the bottles and stuff around the shower and on the floor. I really like it. The quality is good as the mesh is really thick. I like the fact that you can put the bottles in upside down and you do not have to remove them in order to us the shampoo/conditioner. But, you have to have the right kind of bottles. My son uses Head and Shoulders and that bottle will not work inside of this. It would be easy to just get bottles and pour the contents in also. I like the hooks for the loofahs also"
3,Good Organizer,"It's a good shower organizer. I washed it, recently. It didn't hold up as well as I had hoped. The metal/plastic shaper poked through the binding and one side came unattached."
5,Perfect solution to a crowded shower stall.,"This organizer is perfect for our family and exactly what we were looking for. We tried the organizers that hang from the shower head, but they are so bulky they were in the way. We have an adjustable shower head on a hose so having an organizer that hangs somewhere else is great."
3,check your local dollar general,"I don't have a problem with the actual product, but soon after I purchased this, I noticed a VERY similar version at the Dollar General for only $2.50. So before you buy this one, check around & save some $$. This item was grouped with RV supplies, so when shopping, I assumed it would work w/ my shower in my camper...sadly it does not. Make sure you have a rod (like shown in picture) and not a track system that is attached to your camper ceiling or else it won't work."
5,Awesome for the Motorhome!,"Bought this to put in our RV. This is awesome, since it keeps the shower supplies off the floor. Its a good quality product that hold full size bottles of shampoos and conditioners, soaps, etc."
3,Helpful organizer,"I like this organizer, but it's smaller than I had expected-expecially the top pockets. I like how you can pour shampoo or conditioner without having to take the bottle out of the pockets."
3,Hmmm,I like the 'idea' of this organizer but unfortunately the razors do not fit in pockets as shown. I agree with the other comments in that the top pockets should be deeper. It holds the shampoo and soap well. I am using it until I can find something else I like. This is not to take anything away from the seller who shipped the item fast and the item was in great condition.
4,Cool shower buddy,This is a really cool shower organizer. It stays hidden from sight. It holds a lot of items that are readily available at your fingertips!
3,Top pockets too small,"As others have commented, the top pockets on each side are too small to be useful. (Middle pocket OK for soap.) They appear deeper in the photo, maybe due to the angle. The upside-down feature is great, but advise looking for less expensive option."
2,Hanging Mesh Shower Organizer,"I bought this and the Maytex hanging mesh shower organizer since I couldn't make up my mind! I liked that the lower three pockets on this one were taller/bigger than the other model and that this one had hooks on the side to hang a shower pouf or whatever. BUT the mesh on this one is much poorer quality & kept snagging on everything I tried to put in there. Also, the holes on the bottom of the three larger pockets are so big that a small tube of shampoo or face wash will slide right through. The final strike against this product was that the holes at top where it is supposed to attach to your shower curtain are very small and would not fit over the small decorative ball on the shower curtain hooks that I use. I am returning this one and keeping the other."
5,Space Saver without the mess,"Love it! Holds everything ""high and dry"" in the shower and well within reach. I have a bad back so picking up something I dropped in the shower is kind of tricky. This product solves all that. I am considering sewing the middle of one of the larger pockets shut tho. My tube of toothpaste keps falling thro, but that's an easy fix.Will probably get more for holiday gifts for the fam."
2,Dis-organizer,"This is a good organizer, perphaps, if your tub items are quite large (for the lower sections) and you don't mind them hanging upside down and spilling into your palm, and/or quite tiny (for the top ones). Mine are mid-size: two regular size shampoo bottles, a tube of toothpaste, a toothbrush, a pumice stone, a shower mitt, and a razor. Nothing fit nicely. I can't describe it, but somehow the webbing in the product causes almost as much friction as velcro. Nothing moves smoothly within it. Then, when it does move, it's only to fall out of the large openings in the bottom. I actually hurt my toe when something fell out of the organizer and banged me on the foot. Laugh please, someone should, cuz it hurt. Needless to say, this is going back. I was so excited to get organized! I hate clutter. But it just ain't the right size."
4,Happy whit this product.,"The organizer works really good , I'm happy that I got it. I don't give 5 starts because the top packets are a little small. A A little more deep will be perfect !! :)"
4,Love it!,"I was looking for something cause my shower head wont hold the metal ones, and I am so glad I found this. It is way better than the metal ones that rust and get nasty. The only bad thing is the top pockets should be a little longer, my razor keeps falling out. Other than that it is great! Also it is easier to clean the shower, I dont have to haul out my million bottles of shampoo ect."
5,What a wonderful story,I listen to it over and over. The truth of overcoming difficulties with kindness is such a great one for children young and old.
5,Inspirational!,"If you have ever struggled with perfection or living up to the standards of the Proverbs 31 woman, then this is a must read for you!"
4,I Am Fearfully and Wonderfully Made,"This is a good book for the Wonder women of the world. Also another WONDERful book entitled, The Unspoken Rules of Love: What Men Don't Know, What Women Don't Tell You."
5,"Great Beach Boys record here, folks!","It's a damn shame that most of the Beach Boys original recordings are out of print. 20/20, like so many of their records, is quirky, often brilliant and endlessly listenable. The Beach Boys are the greatest American band ever -- hands down.For my money, every song on this record is a classic."
5,Tractor cover,This cover is an excellent fit and of quality material.I would definetly buy this or other products from this supplier.Thank you so much.
1,It is not waterproof,The day i got it i put it on my lawn tractor. It rained that night. A couple days later i took the cover off and there was a big puddle of water in the seat.I do not recommend this cover.
5,classic tractor cover,"recently purchased a classic accessories tractor cover for my john deere GT 245 tractor. placed it on the tractor the same day I received it and it fit perfectly! the true test of this item came when hurricane Sandy hit my area on the east coast. simply put, this cover absolutely provided the BEST protection during the 24 hours that Sandy with its rain and tremendous winds pummeled this area. This is a great item.it never came off, blew around, moved etc. what a wonderful product."
1,Tractor Cover,"If I could rate this -1 I would. The cover isn't waterproof, the materials and workmanship are terrible. The cover is falling apart after 3 months. Not what you would expect for an item that costs $60-$70. I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon and this is the worst item I've ever purchased. If there was some way to return it I would. Don't buy this item even at 10% of what is being charged."
4,Classic Accessories Deluxe Tractor Cover is GOOD!,"Tried their light duty ""green"" model, and HATED it! NOT waterproof, and fell apart after a year.Classic Accessories 73910 Lawn Tractor CoverThis ""black"" heavy duty/waterproof model is now on second year, and doing good.I'd give it a 5 but- Elastic shock cord in bottom hem is not heavy enough, and cover blows off in a STRONG wind (I also use a long bungee cord across the top, when I remember).~~~~~~~~~~~Update: I'm now on 6th year, and rain now puddles on seat of my old 56"" Craftsman.I'm getting a new John Deere 54"", and will order this cover for it."
5,Great Cover!!!,"Initially I was apprehensive about the other reviews since I needed a cover that could stand up to rain,snow and wind. The material used is heavy duty and extremely durable. I ordered two covers, one for a John Deere 318 and a Craftsman GT5000. The Craftsman has a 48 inch deck and the cover was installed with no problems. It covered everything down to the ground (below the wheels). Even on a larger tractor it completely covered everything. There are wind/slash vents to the right and left of the seat. The cover needs to be installed properly so that Wind/Water isn't carried through these vents on to the seat. Also the rear drawstring is able to be stretched to enlarge the width of the bottom of the cover. For me, this cover has already stood up to a dozen rain storms, snow and wind. I haven't had any problems with Water coming through the cover. 5 stars in my book. Well worth the money."
4,Having the facts and the truth can set you free!,"The book will be a fast read for teenagers. In fact, my teenage children picked it up and didn't put it down until they had completed the book, showing how riveting and captivating the book was for teenagers. (The very audience that the author is attempting to capture!) As a parent, I really liked the fact that a CD containing information about childhood abuse and how a person feeling strapped within a bad situation can find help using this CD-Rom. Overall, my teenagers loved the book and really felt bad for Tiffany (in the beginning of the book)and very happy for her by the end of the book. Thanks for a great book!"
1,Poor quality JUNK!,"I ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life. After about 1-2 months of use, the thing shorted out and wouldn't work any more. I decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured I'd give it another chance... the thing didn't even work out of the box this time.I only wish I could give it Zero stars... spend the money on a Motorola brand charger instead."
5,A Great Phone,"The Sony Ericsson 750i Ia great little phone. I previously owned the k700i and even though IS was a good phone too, I find that the 750i is in many ways much better. With a useful 34 megs of memory this is a great multi media phone, you can download songs via bluetooth from your computer and use this phone as a mini mp3 player. It has a 2 megapixel camera with auto-focus and x4 digital zoom, (a low-mid ranged digital camera having around the same) and this phone takes amazing pictures. You can also record videos and for much longer than your average phone.This Sony Ericsson phone is entertaining in times of boredom with music, an fm radio and java games. In all this phone is sturdy and durable, looks good and has many fun features. Its a good buy."
3,Good Phone but not for most American Users,I recently purchased this phone from Amazon and while it has great features and was really good looking it only worked in certain parts of my town. One place it did not work was at my house. I found out that it was because this is a Tri-band phone (It only supports 3 bandwidths) Two of the supported bands are only used in Europe and the other one is used here but along with a band that is not supported by the phone. So in some areas where the supported band was operational the phone would have service but at my house where the unsupported band was in use it would not have service. If an American user wishes to get this phone I would recommend getting a quad-band phone instead that way all bandwidths are supported.This was still a good phone and if you will not run into this issue then by all means get it but be aware that it may not work every where in the US.
5,Graco makes a quality product to trust. . .,This is my second travel system from Graco and my third infant car seat. Although baby isn't here yet I had no doubt which system I would be purchasing. The pattern is beautiful gray with pink and a floral motif for our first girl. And safety for the infant car seat was and remains a main priority. The stroller was easy to put together and manuevers well. The only reason we don't have the original sets we purchased was because we have large spaces between our children and we were able to sell our last travel system rather than store it. Graco customer service is also wonderful if any questions or problems arise they will fix it at no charge and really quickly. We had a pointy ribbing sticking out of a car seat and they replaced the entire system because they couldn't match the pattern. A great company and a great product!
5,Very Happy with this purchase,"So far I am extremely happy with this purchase.I love the color, its the best combination of pink on the market.Folds up very easily and the carrier seems to be very sturdy.Would highly recommend this system."
3,Eternity disapoints after Eon - but still a good read.,"After reading Eon, I could not wait to get my hands on the follow-up.. . and in some ways ""Eternity"" came through better than I hoped.There are some really clever twists and plot threads in this novel, but in the end it fades away rather than fulfilling the promise of the first book. There is also some great writing through the first two thirds of this book, but you may feel the last third leaves you wanting more. Great ideas abound in this novel, but they never seem to reach the climax the reader anticipates.There is plenty of room for yet another sequel, but the story seems to work hard to quickly tie up any loose ends, just in case Greg Bear decides not to go beyond Eternity. If you liked Eon, read this novel, but be prepared a different intensity level."
5,auhhh this was an awesome book,I really enjoyed this book it had lots of good stuff in it. REALLY enjoyed the first one of the series though
4,This was a good sequel.,I enjoyed this sequel to EON as Eternity followed right along on the story line. All in all this was a pretty good read. Enjoyed both books.
2,Editorial standards are certainly lacking,"I had somewhat forgotten how Greg Bear wrote. His descriptions of the Jart are so obscure and long-winded, the reader may as well just turn the page. I found it annoying that Greg Bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than Eon. My largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos, duplicated words, letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive. It really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated. While I'd admit that an author is more concerned with flow, plot, and technical accuracy - the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Infinite way, yes or no?It was going to be pretty hard to live up to the outstanding predecessor to this novel, Eon, and rather than following that directly this book has a rather different tone, following people other than your standard Earth humans, including a young woman from a rather different alternate universe.I suppose you could say it has a bit more of a mythological feel at times, but a definite disappointment after the first book."
5,If I had only one book,"If I was forced to have only one book, this would be it. Not for the Herd or Lazy. No fluff around the edges, tells it like it really is."
5,Fascinating,"This is the most shocking book I have ever read. We always have the feeling that there is a book that will change your vision of the world, well, this is it."
5,The portal for a few,"This book is an introduction to the Teaching of the Age. Gurdjieff had read this book when it was published and, for the most part, gave it a favorable review. It is no substitute for ALL AND EVERYTHING but it is a fine introduction to the ideas."
5,Inspiring book,"A book that combines those rare attributes of being a ""page-turner"" and extremely thought-provoking. Highly recommended."
2,Too difficult for a 3 yr old. Parts not durable.,"I can hardly believe this toy is slated for a [...] Two intelligent adults couldn't figure out how to change the suspension feature. We found the parts too delicate, too breakable and too difficult to function even for an adult. The doors on the truck are way too difficult to open, having no purchase on the handle and the hood requires a sort of pulling-out and swinging-up motion to open which is too subtle for a young child. Also the tools are hard to fit into the firemen's hands."
2,Send out the Clean up crews,"I purchased this item for my 4, almost 5 year old. It is way over his head...not surprisingly as it is almost over mine. As stated in another review, this looks more like a rescue vehicle than a firetruck...also...the multiple pieces that come with this toy make it that much more of an advanced toy...not really for a 3 year old. The manufacter recommended age is 36 months to 8 years. I would say more like 6 to 8 years and no less. I almost feel like it is a collectors item that should be sitting on a shelf...so you don't lose it's parts...but I do not think the manufactuer's intended it to be so. Unless your child is a perfectionist and super detailed...this really isn't the toy for them (in my opinion, of course)."
4,Impressive toy,"My 5 year old son loves this truck. It has impressive features that provide endless role playing. Several compartments to store accessories. It has a detachable extention ladder, stretcher and fire hose. You can adjust the ride height although I don't know why you would want to do that and it looks compilcated to do it, it could provide additional role playing. Doors and hood open so the figurine can ride in the cab. A few issues that keep this from being a 5 star toy are: compartments are a little hard to get open, light bar detaches too easily, front wheels want to turn so it is difficult to get it to roll in a straight line."
2,Good news / Bad news,"Good News - our 2 year old grandson loved it.Bad News - the light bar didn't work. My son will have to go out and find 3 ""watch"" style batteries. The arms came off the fireman. And turn signals were able to be pulled off the grill and on and on. Too many SMALL PIECES.I sure wish that the listing had an AGE APPROPRIATE on it. (I think that's an Amazon issue.)I liked it because the doors opened and the storage bins opened. I couldn't figure out (in 5 minutes) how to make the ladder work.I wish there was a basic model without all the tiny removable pieces to get only the the ""good news"" about the product."
3,Falls Apart,"My original review shortly after purchase:Overall, I love this fire truck I purchased for my son for his 3rd birthday. He loves fire trucks and the Mighty World toys are great for pretend play with the firemen figures and tools. The tools are small, so be careful of younger siblings. It really is a ""big kid"" toy. A few of the smaller pieces did come apart but were easily repaired with Super Glue.My review 2 years later:Piece frequently break off of this and other Mighty World trucks that we have. Anything with a hinge seems to break. Between the three trucks we have I'd say close to 15 pieces have broken beyond repair."
2,"OK, but much better books out there","Maybe I expect too much out of a book, but in order to get 5 stars out of me a book has to be an exhaustive review of the topic, enlightening or at least entertaining. This book was none of these.It skims the many facets of raising a toddler, based on all the ""current research"", but doesn't go further than that. For example, my daughter has recently acquired a fear of the dark. They tell me this is normal. Gee thanks. No review of common fears, no clever ways to handle it, nothing.It was like getting advice from a pediatrician who didn't go home and parent. Save your money."
3,Classic Ed,"I could not wait to watch this classic. It have all the stars that it talked about, but I have to say I was very disappointed. It only has clips of the performances and I had hoped for all the songs."
1,Disappointed,"I have no idea what this book really contains - I want to review the book, not really the prices, but what it containes so I know I am ording the right book, but all it says is Avon Bottles, Research and History. Research and history of what kind of old Avon bottles? It may not be the one I want or contains the bottles I want to price to sell. So basicly it's no good to me until I know what any of your books covers."
4,Amazing introduction to an amazing life and personality,"Most readers will know of ""Silent Spring"", however, this biography from the Greenwood series, is an apt and well formulated summary of the epitomy of the cirumstances that created Rachel Carson's legacy.It is a quick read that provides cursory insight. My only criticism is that the intensity that is the persona of Rachel Carson comes off somewhat languid and apolitical, although this is understandable in the intent of composing a brief biography. Highly recommended to accompany any high school student's project on the history of environmentalism, or on the naturalist movement."
2,"good watch, bad strap","I've had this watch for about 6 months now and have loved it. I love the style, function, and colors. My only complaint is with the strap. It has a thin, cheep layer of nylon stitched over the length of the top side, with wide holes punched in it for the buckle. This layer of nylon is not held to the other layers of the strap around the buckle holes, so it has room to stretch, fray, and tear off. After this happens the layer below comes out, because it is not even stitched in at all - only held by the nylon. When that happens, you are left with one layer of nice, but thin brown leather that is not strong enough for a strap (not to mention, it looks like crap at this point).To make a long story short - the strap sucks and WILL need to be replaced, but it can only be replaced by one made just for this watch since it uses a non-standard mounting system (no off the shelf straps will fit this). I'm going to be returning mine and getting a different watch."
4,Great Watch,I am very pleased with this watch. I use the various timers at work all the time and the alarm and compass at play. The new type of night light screen is great! The only area of concern is the band. I'm not sure it will hold up for any length of time but I could be wrong.
2,meandering techno lite,"john beltran has released a few decent albums under his own name for r & s records and peacefrog respectively. here, as indio, beltran's joined by seth taylor and sam mcqueen and like his solo output, this is new age techno for the Windham Hill crowd. here beltran and his cohorts have the unfortunate tendency of coating their subtle beats with a new age veener of meandering synth string streaks and echoed piano twinklings replete with titles like ""a thousand storms"" and ""earthtones."" this is music that wouldn't be out of place in the cd racks of a sante fe crystal healing shop along side the likes of hearts of space and narada recording artists. soft, gentle and utterly vapid, this music has all the spirituality and groove of change rattling in a cash registrar."
2,HooHah!,"Take it for what it is worth. Written at the height of the ninja/pow/soldier of fortune craze it was probably heady brew at the time. The material currently available in this genre are much more sophisticated now. The sexual escapades are wooden and flat at best. There is no sense of gratification, just some sort of odd obligation. Almost no action sequences to speak of except at the beginning of the book. ""his hands would have had to be registered as lethal weapons."" Please, this is so blatantly dating itself. The author came recommended as very entertaining in this genre so I will read another one."
3,"A compelling character, with not a lot to do","This is the only Johnstone book I have read, and I am sorry to say I was not especially impressed.Terry Kovac was an interesting character, but there seemed to be very little actual plot to the book, it was more like a series of recollections. Terry seems to find himself in similar situations over and over again (wooing and leaving women, letting his temper get him in trouble).But the book was sorely lacking in action, at least from the perspective of someone who reads a lot of action thrillers. I am willing to keep an open mind if someone has a recomendation for another one of his novels.I enjoyed the entire premise, and the characters were well drawn.. I just wish they had more to do."
1,Completely Stupid,"Terry Kovak...Part man, part machine. Yawn! This book is a complete waste of reading time. My $5.00 would have been better spent buying a Happy Meal from McDonalds. At least it would have been more satisfying."
4,Just Damn Good,"I'm a good fan of Bill's, and as always he didn't let me down. As an U.S. Marine I have met and know men such as Terry Kovak, they ARE real. This was a intresting story that makes you think. I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,I agree with not alot to do,"This was the first Johnstone book I read and I can say one thing, the book was intriguing enough that I could not put it down. I read it within a 24 hour period. Though I agree that I could not really clearly identify a plot (if there was one). The constant wooing and losing of women got old. Great that he is a stud but enough of his problems with intimacy. Great premise for a story but not enough development to the full range of characters and plot. Again it was a good read but I hope he has better stuff."
2,Main character not believable,"I have read and enjoyed Johnstone's books, however this one is not his best by far. The book is readable and well written. The main character is a cold psychopath, he is not likable and too cartoon like. I look for better from Johnstone."
2,An OK Overview,"Pass on the hype.....this book is a soft general overview. However it lacks on technical details. It focuses mainly in two areas, 883 coversion and history. Again the 883 conversion IS NOT TECHNICALLY DEEP and I would even venture to say lacking. I was disapointed in this book. Not recommended."
1,Poorly outdated and lacking any detail,Though this book discussed and touches on many different performance modifications it lacks ANY true technical information and is merely a good read for those interested in history and development more so than how to get true performance gains. Most of the technical information is severely outdated (late 80's and early 90's) and supports methodology which has been proven as a performance LOSS in this day and age (such as mirror finish port polishing!)Is a nostalgic rag to be read but not a guide to go by...
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book really gives you the little details that will help you make the most of every dollar on performance modifications .
2,Good book lots of photos,I bought the book to help me pick components for a complete build. It did a better job of giving me the history. I would have appreciated a little more detail about component numbers and what parts fit with what. It spend more time telling me about the 2004 upgrades. If you have a bike older than 2004 do not buy this book. He dose not talk about much other than 2004!
3,Sporty,This book had a wealth and knowledge however it was a bit out of date did not cover the new fuel injected sportsters
2,harley davidson sportster performance handbook,"this cannot possibly be a new book in the condition i received it in. i feel cheated, and the condition has nothing to do with the packaging."
3,Accurate but dated information,"This performance guide is a good reference companion to the factory service manual. It takes you through a typical engine build and provides performance tips and suggestions. However, this book concentrates on earlier builds of the sportster and has very few references to the current rubbermounted Evolution motors. This limits its usefullness to the earlier shovelhead and evolution motors prior to 2004. Much of the information is available on web sites, but it is nice to have a ""one source"" guide with the info handy. Other sections ofthe book are dedicated to sportster history, which was nice, but I could live without, especially considering the books title."
3,Confortable Shoes,"To good to be true...Are they original? Or some Chinesse copy? Any how good quality, at a right price..Go for it¡"
3,War Of The Worlds On A Shoestring...,"Global supertars Charles Napier and Hoke Howell headline this tale of aliens in computer-generated ships gone mad! The amazing thing about this movie is it's scope (or lack thereof). We see snipets of cartoon ships blasting city-scapes, while 99.9% of the action takes place in a prison van, a sheriff's office, and a cave! Actually, this works fairly well, although it could have been about 20 minutes shorter without losing much ""suspense"". So, go ahead and watch, knowing that it could have been far worse..."
2,low quality reprint,"Be aware that this is more like a bad photocopy. Some mathematical symbols are missing from formulas. Dots of i are also frequently missing. The book is definitely overpriced for the low quality one gets. However, this was the only source I could find to obtain the book."
1,This 2003 edition by Westview press (Perseus books group) has a very notorious and bothering effect all around the book,"If you examine this book edition, you could easly see that in most of the pages the letter i (minuscule) lacks the point on it, this fact makes the sentences difficult to read because this truncated or incomplete letter jointly with many consonants makes the words in which it appears confusing and difficult to read, you should avoid selling and delivering this book edition to customers who payed their money for this trash."
1,No maps or pictures!,"Based on past reviews, I purchased this guide for an upcoming trip to Nova Scotia and PEI. Reading it has been utterly frustrating. Complaint #1: the maps are AWFUL. The text will mention a park or city or scenic drive, and it is NOT EVEN MARKED ON THE MAP. This makes the guide completely useless for planning a trip. Complaint #2: there is a severe shortage of affordable ""where to stay"" options; I found most listings seem similar in their style and price range (quaint inn/B&B;, ~$120). Complaint #3: the writing is extremely dry. I'm not quite sure where the previous reviewer found humor in this guide.Bottom line - I will HAVE to purchase another guide. Another reviewer stated that this guide needs to be complemented with another; I would suggest that this guide has nothing unique to offer and skip it altogether and go with Fodor's instead."
3,Great Overview,"This book provides a comprehensive overview of the truth extraction and evaluation process. It contains valuable insight into the importance of question construction, sequencing and the quantitative assessment methods employed to evaluate a respondent's answers. The indepth description of parallel truth/deception indicators such as body language, response tone, attention span, etc. and how they provide clues about an individual's honesty are interesting and useful.This book is a must read as a first step into the world of interviewing job applicants, suspects and others."
4,OK,"Pretty neat item, very useful. Metal dents easily and it is easy to loose. Fell out of my pocket and lost it at the movies 2 weeks after I got it."
2,"Poor construction, low capacity","My copy of this product was very poorly constructed. The top hinge was weak and very...bendy. The lid doesn't mate with the body very well when closed. Not worth the $7.99. If it was $2.50 or so I'd have gotten what I paid for.Also, I didn't realize from the photo that this thing only holds 7 toothpicks. For the size of the device it should hold about twice that.All around not happy. Go for a different one."
1,Broken After three days,"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!I bought this because I am quitting smoking and wanted something that I could have in my pocket to help me fight the urge to smoke. This holder only holds about 8 toothpicks, is made in China, and it fell apart on the third day.STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT!!!!!!!"
1,Do not buy if intending to use product with flavored toothpicks.,"I purchased cinnamon toothpicks and this product was recommended by Amazon; bad recommendation. While this may work well with unflavored toothpicks any toothpick that is flavored ""melts"" into the plastic. Very disappointed in product and Amazon for recommending same."
1,Poor build,"I got this and it has rust on the INSIDE (the side that's exposed to toothpicks) of the metal cap from day one. Wish it were rust-free, since it's a toothpick container."
2,Broke after two weeks of use,"Just like the title says product works great,but the cheap hinge on the lid broke in two weeks..If you need to carry toothpicks around on a regular basis use an old Altoids tin..."
4,wow,"im upset nobody told me about this band sooner,i saw the disc sitting in the free section at a local record store and decided why not give it a shot and to my supprise its an amazing record,heavy crushing DOOOOOOM,makes you unable to move while listening."
1,Find a different edition!,"I just received this a copy of this text. Although it is a fascimile, the vast majority of the page images have a background nearly as dark as the typeface. Page 345 is entirely missing.I would NOT recommend this edition."
2,Not What I expected,"I would not reccomend this to someone who wants to read the book itself. It is a copy of pages, and some pages are missing. For some collector or fan of the book it MIGHT be worth having for some reason. To just read ...the type face and quality are not good at all."
5,The best protein shake on the market,A Bio-Chemist recommended that I use this shake. I love the taste. I like it best with soymilk and mixed berries and banana's mixed together with a blender. The shake comes with amino-acids which we don't get in our diets today. Amazon has the best price I have found anywhere on the net and locally. It can take a little while to receive but is definatly worth the wait. Just be sure to order well before you run out!
5,Informative and Interesting,"I am not Jewish, I happened upon this book and I read it because it had to do with meditation. I'm very glad I did. I meditate every day, 30 minutes each morning and evening. I wanted to learn more about meditation and I got what I wanted from this book and a whole lot more. I learned so much about meditation and it's role in Jewish history. I found it so interesting and really enjoyed the journey. I think this book is wonderful for everyone. It doesn't matter your religion. This is a very spiritual, enlightening and significant book for both avid meditators and those just beginning a practice. I would recommend this to anyone interested in meditation or wanting to learn more about Jewish history and traditions. It is extremely interesting and informative."
3,Not that bad,"I did not like chapter one, thought it was a bunch of circular talk but, it got better. I used it for school and I actually took some good information away from it."
1,Not enough info,It might be nice if the seller would include the dimensions of the carpet. Why would anyone buy a product without knowing what they were getting????
1,It sucks,"The more I use these GE phones the more I realize they just plain suck. I have three major complaints:1. We have a long distance plan where we have to dial an 800 number then enter in the phone number we want to dial. The easy way we used to do it on our old phones is dial the 800 number then wait for the prompt, then go back on the caller ID list and hit dial, then it would dial the number for us. But nooo... not on these phones, YOU CAN'T review your caller id while the phone is in the Talk mode. The buttons only alter the volume. LAME.2. Both handsets can't be on at the same time. It's one or the other.3. There is no ringer volume to change, it's either on or off. LAMEother than a little static in the far end of the house... they work ok."
5,Some of Iggy's best solo stuff.,First off R.I.P Ron Asheton.Now for these discs this comolation is awsome!I collect Iggy as well as the stooges cds and if you want Iggy buy this set theres only 2000 of 'em so order up!!
5,Another Winner!,"I loved this book! This is the second Kathleen Kane book that I have read. The humor and 1998 slang she throws into the 1800's is a riot! Nora is such a spitfire! I had to call my book store and order two more of her books. If you like time-travel romance with a lot of humor, you would love this book. I would have to say it's a MUST READ!"
5,Great read..,"A new take on time travel and reincarnation together.Nora/Tracy is killed accidently by a bowling ball (LOL.)The 3 committe members, Tom, Dick and Harry. Curly, Moe and Larry. Huey, Dewey and Louie. That's what Nora/Tracy called them, depending on her mood, know they're in big trouble when they have to start making deals with Nora/Tracy in order to get her to go back to earth, because it isn't her time yet.Anyway, this book was so good and soo funny.I would definately recommand this book to any and all romance readers."
4,Fun read,"I have to admit I am usually not a fan of historical romances but the fish out of water aspect of our heroine being sent back in time to finish her life after 8 freak accidents was fun. Tracy / Nora thinks she is so smart and can get the Committee to give her what she wants to live out her days in the lap of luxery. Be careful what you wish for and make sure to be specific or you could find yourself living on a ranch in Montana in the Wild West.I loved how the old soul was ready to shake things up a little and after 8 premature endings to her life over a man Tracy was ready to live her life on her own terms. A little time travel, a little intrigue and a good dose of romance made a fun read."
2,Where's the passion,"I couldn't finish this book. I tried, I kept picking it back up, but to no avail. The heroine is crude and selfish, and the hero?? is too much like Clint Eastwood for my tastes. Although the plot and storyline is original and unique. Maybe if the characters were more into each other instead of themselves it would have been a nice novel."
1,Worst GPS I ever tried,"I should have known that something was wrong when I opened the package and found inside somebody else's packing slip and yellow note page. Apparently, someone returned it and they sent it to me without even checking the contents of the box.As for the GPS - it seems to know where you are. However, it does not know how to get to your destination. I used it side by side with a Garmin 660. The Garmin took me to the address while the Invion tried to direct me to a location down the road half a mile. That happened every time at different locations.In addition, the processor seems underpowered and every operation took forever. I have used multiple GPS systems before and this one is the worst."
2,Disappointed,"I have to drive for a few miles before the satellite recognizes my vehicle. Otherwise, I stare of a map of my house. POI is not very accurate and difficult to search for specific restaurants. (my friend has a Garmin, we type in the first few letters of a restaurant we want to got to and it finds it). Selecting Region every time it is turned on is annoying, plus it doesn't always recognize east cost. I tap on Florida and get Canada or Mid West as my region!"
2,Very poor...,"1. Opened the box. It GPS did not recognize the SD card. [then I tried keeping the SD card in my digital camera just to find out if the card is working fine or not. I could see some files in the SD card, so I concluded that the SD card is ok and the culprit is the GPS. I tried to search on their website, there is not FAQ and no 800 number to call]. After few tries finaly I was successful in going to the next step.2)Every time you start the system,it ask to select a region. [Why the hell they need this info ? Isnt GPS supposed to do that ??]3)I stay in East cost and I am unable to select the east cost!!!4)Audio info is too bad[dont tell you when to take turns5)If you miss the turn, it wont tell you right away.The only good thing I liked is the window mounting device came along with this is good. Other than that it not worth it.So my recommentation: DONT buy this product."
2,Not the best GPS by a long shot,The select features on this GPS are frustrating. You often have to redo your selections because the GPS likes to make suggestions that don't help. It also won't let you look ahead in your directions and doesn't say street names.
2,Don't like it compared to the 1985 version,"I found this text to be a waste of money as an ESL teacher of beginner to advanced students. The layout was dense, illustrations were nonexistent, the exercises were limited, and the contexts used in the introductions of each unit were unhelpful. If it weren't only $10 I would return it. Instead I looked for the 1985 version, bought it and was much happier."
1,Not So Easy,"I cannot recommend this book. I bought it to help me in writing a history book I am having published (The Super Summary of World History), and it was no help at all. I suggest The Elements of Style as a good alternative. This is printed in the workbook style, which requires one to go from lesson to lesson to achieve the goal of learning the subject. I needed something far different.In my opinion this is a brush up kind of ""course"" on English, but not a very good one. The authors think that definitions alone will cause one to understand what the parts of English are, and a few examples suffice to show the reader how to incorporate the idea into writing, speaking or whatever. It doesn't work. Once a concept has been covered the next part of the book assumes the student now has that down pat and the authors do not spend enough time explaining how these parts of speech relate to one another or how they might be critical in good writing.Look elsewhere for an English course."
4,Helpfull and worthfull,"I'm using this book already, borrowed from a friend... and I had decided to buy it just because when I read a good book I want to own it. Its clear, with a lot of exercises, just lack the answers (important factor for those that aren't quite well familiar with english) but, in overall it's a valuable book and helpfull to learn english"
5,good for music theory or composition students,"If you want to learn advanced harmony, there is no better place to learn it than from the Master himself.When I was a student at Interlochen, the last music theory assignment was to copy a German chorale melody without seeing Bach's harmonization, harmonize it, and compare one's own harmonization with Bach's harmonization.Humiliating!"
4,Great theme Song,"I never followed Patty Duke's musical career but as a collector of TV themes and soundtracks, this CD is a MUST HAVE. Not only does it include both season's Main and End Titles but it also includes the second season's main and end title master backing track (refered to as the sing-a-long track). It's rare that CD producers do this but I wish they'd do it more often. The CD would probably sell to a wider demographic. It's too bad that the first season's main and end title master backing track wasn't included as well."
2,Not quite the best fit for an Equinox,"The instructions are generic to the product, meaning they just don't tell you some of the key details. For the fronts it is necessary to loosen up the side view mirror trim. You must pop off the tweeter trim piece from inside and loosen 2 nuts with a metric socket. Same with the rear windows-you need to loosen up the back of the window trim by accessing from an interior trim piece.Even with that the driver's side front fitment was very tight and the first time the window went up it shattered the bottom edge of the Vent Visor at the window rear. The rear Vent Visors also do not push up far enough into the window moulding so the window scrapes the bottom edge each time it goes down past the VVisor and back up.I can't recommend these to a 2005-2011 Equinox owner. We let them sit for almost 2 full days for the tape to stick well up into the window mouldings, the Equinox is just too tight at the tops for these to fit adequately all the way."
3,A Laugh Riot,This is one of the funniest C.D.'s I've heard in quite some time. Number 7 (I cannot answer you) is my favorite.
3,You can get through it -,"Tom Sine espouses his theories on globalism and how believers in Christ and how they can, do, do not, sometimes, might go together. How does one influence the other? Who should we minister to? Tom relies heavily on statistics, so much so that the book is almost blinding at times. One can really go into statistical overload reading this book. With that said, Sine was ahead of the curve in 1999 predicting global terrorism before 9/11. He also makes a strong case for ministering to the least of us, the homeless, etc. This book has a pretty strong liberal bend to it, and still is useful. Although a bit dated, it still picks up on trends of the McWorld globalization that is still occurring at a rapid rate.It is frightening to see in every town an office depot, target, old navy, petco, etc. Its like no matter where you go you can get the same exact thing. My wife and I always try to find anything but Applebees."
1,Introduction to Action Research : Social Research for Social Change,The most boring text book I have ever read. info was not well presented
4,well done,"This is a very entertaining book of remembrances of a great driver, by his friends and colleagues. It doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive biography, and isn't, but there isn't enough out there about Mr. Miles, so anything is quite welcome. The one thing that EVERY book about Miles says is that he is not appreciated in the modern era for his matchless abilities in driving and race car setup. That's true and it's a pity, but this book goes a good distance in showing us not only Miles the driver but Miles the person. Well done, and very much appreciated."
5,Inspiring and Insightful,"As someone with a deep interest in holistic health, I found Reiki for Children a beautifully written and insightful experience. Each chapter is broken into easily understandable concepts and shared with colorful imagery that even the youngest can grasp. I have started sharing the concepts of reconnection found in the early chapters of the book with my 4.5 year old daughter, and we both savor our quiet time in nature to reconnect and absorb. I look forward to sharing the rest of this inspiring book with my daughter and connecting to the healing power available to all of us."
4,nice and mellow,"Mellow folky stuff from Finland. Artisokka's charmingly low-key first album is all clean guitar, soft drumming, violin and snyth backing, songs sung in mostly hushed tones. Highlights range from nicely-crafted pop songs ""Mint"" and ""Imprint"" to moody slow-builders ""Cold Winter"" and ""Offshore"". Think Sam Prekop and Kings of Convenience. It won't hit you immediately, but does grow quite well. Very nice cd artwork."
5,Excellent Information for Couples,"This is the first Walt Disney World travel book I purchased to research our upcoming trip and I honestly think I could have stopped with this one. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of fill-in-the-blank pages and pockets to store things but what is does have is information and lots of it. The book is extremely thorough from beginning to end and covers just about every aspect of planning a romantic Disney World vacation for a couple or a family with children. The information is covered concisely in an easy to read format that makes the reader want to skim through again and again to reference their favorite parts. I have yet to experience the Disney World that the Perlmutters describe in this wonderful guide but I can honestly say that I simply can't wait to do so because of the wonderful way they have described every last detail. In the language of the book, I give the Walt Disney World for Couples, 5th Edition 5 stars for romance!!"
4,Excellent toy for creative little minds,"This is an excellent toy for creative little minds - you can make all sorts of objects such as houses, cups, cranes, etc, and they are never tired of playing with these. The only disadvantage is that the pieces are very small and can easily come apart from whatever structure you are building if you exert too much force, causing frustration and anger to the little ones. Overall great value for a great toy!"
1,Junk!,"What happened to GE products these days? Yet another junk product by GE. I bought two of these last month for $25.00 and I paid $24.00 too much! They are total garbage! May as well use soup cans and string. The sound quality is absolutely terrible, even set on high. Range is terrible, fading and static 40 feet from the base.My eight year old worn out Unidens are excellent compared to this junk.Only thing decent is the answering machine. Save your money, these aren't worth paying for shipping. Buy something tried and true that has good reviews."
3,ok but my kid could pull it off,they were nice until my daughter realized she could pull up the sticky part with her fingers. Then the food would be all over the place. Worth the try!
5,Good Book!!!,"I bought this book to learn more about SFBT for a paper. Once I got into the book, I really enjoyed it. Guterman is a transformed REBT therapist and uses solution-focused therapy now. He gives detailed examples of how SFBT can be used to treat a plethora of mental illnesses and a case study of a particularly tough client of his. A great read for any therapist or future therapist."
5,SolutionFocused Counseling,Excellent overview of solution-focused therapy. Very helpful to me as a practioner of brief therapy. I would reommend it for new therapists or those of us who have worked in the field for some time.
5,Excellent,"An excellent read for beginning therapists. Solution Focused therapy is one of my favorite models to work from. Dr Guterman is insightful, poignant and engaging."
3,The Begnning of the End for Zep,"Ponderous, repetitious, and overly long (should have been one LP instead of two when originally released), ""Physical Graffiti"" even had to have the title song swiped from the previous (and far superior) album ""House of the Holy"" added to this morass to make it more palatable.The well was running dry for Plant and Page when this album was spawned, and it was to be downhill into medicority after this.Led Zeppelin made some great albums, but this isn't one of them."
3,overhyped mess,"Despite its diversity, it's a mess of an album. Most of the songs are annoying, silly things. Despite that, there is some good music, jimmy page is always worth hearing on guitar. He has some fine moments with 'the rover', 'ten years gone by' 'in my time of dying'. 'kashmir' is overrated as a tune, but the sound is good. Nice acoustic guitar cameo, 'bron yr aur'. Then you have muck like 'down by the seaside' and 'boogie with stu' and 'custard pie'. Uneven in quality, taken from studio work from 1972 and 1974, showing that the boys are running out of ideas. They only made 3 more albums,which are poor. Still, I salute them for all the enjoyment their music has given me. Thank you"
5,Led Zeppelin's Best!,"I knew ""Kashmir"" was on here, but this album is so much better than just that. I couldn't believe the depth and excellence of these songs. Each is memorable in its own right and are classics. Disc 2 may be better than disc 1. Turn up the volume and listen to ""In the Light"", ""Night Flight"", ""Down by the Seaside"", or ""Boogie With Stu"", and you will not be disappointed. I love the other Zeppelin albums, but this one has it all from start to finish. If you don't own it, I suggest it!"
5,Great GREAT Album,"Led Zeppelin spends two years creating their own record label and then emerges with this masterpiece. Taking songs that they have written since Houses of the Holy and combining it with material that they had written as much as 5 years earlier and they created the best double album since The White Album. It opens up with the ferocious Custard Pie and The Rover. BTW the opening riff on the Rover is great. In my Time of Dying was long but well worth it. Trampled underfoot was classic. Kashmir is one of the greatest songs ever. While the second disc is not as solid but is still good. The highlights on that disc include Bron-yr-Aur, a nice little acoustic instrumental courtesy of Page, and Ten years Gone. A nice very well done song. If you do not have this album, buy it now"
4,Awesome transaction!!!,"Description of product was right on target. Fast delivery, great person to deal with. I ordered this c.d. right before christmas for a present and it was shipped right away. There are no visiable flaws with the cd or the case except for the normal stuff that I already knew about from the product description."
3,Demosesque,"I like this record in the sense of it's length and classical leanings (namely Baroque), but it's production value is something to be desired. On the majority of the tracks Bonham's drums lack the strong ""thump"" that I've grown so accustomed to. They are on the edge of being demos. One positive note: ""In the Light"" is probably the most underrated Zep songs, so that alone is grounds for a purchase."
3,Should Have Been A Single Album,"Most double albums are inconsistant and Physical Graffiti is no exception.The only perfect double album ever made was Quadrophenia by The Who. This album contains some great tracks like Custard Pie, The Rover, In My Time Of Dying, Kashmir, Ten Years Gone, In The Light and a few others but it could have been trimmed down. Same goes for Exile On Main Street and The White Album. I like Zeppelin i dont love them i find them overrated and basically just another great rock band of their day nothing totally special."
1,lousy remaster,Along with other Led Zeppelin CD's I've purchased from Amazon this sounds muddy and flat. An absolutely horrible remaster apparently from Argentina. I guess Warner has no interest in investing money in producing a quality sounding product for one of the very best rock/blues bands that ever existed. I've listened to it on my car Bose system and my Onkyo component home stereo. The track previews on the page sounded better than the CD itself. A total waste and a darn shame. At least I've still got my vinyl.
4,Zeppelins' White Album,"Its overlong, and there are no ""classic"" songs in the Black Dog vein (well maybe Kashmir) And no, not everything worked: the album could have used some editing. But I rather like this album because Zep stretched out and tried new things. Their willingness and ability to take chances makes Physical Graffiti a very good, if not an excellent album. There's a lot of variety, from the manic slide blues of ""In My Time of Dying"" to the fun piano driven hoedown of ""Boogie With Stu"", to the metalic funk of ""The Wanton Song"" to the countrifried ""Black Country Woman."" Its not all serious, and its not all great (none of it is bad either). Physical Graffiti is kind of a grab bag but a very enjoyable one."
4,'Physical Graffiti' review,"Just the songs ""Trampled under foot"", ""Kashmir"" and ""Ten years gone"" alone make this album worth purchasing.The first Zeppelin album to be released under their own Swan Song label is generally a composite album, adding new material to already existing songs. The instrumental ""Bron-Yr-Aur"" for example was recorded in 1970, but didn't see the light of day until 'Physical Graffiti' in 1975.Other stand outs include ""Houses of the holy"", ""The Wanton song"", ""The rover"" and ""Boogie with Stu"".One thing in paticular that I like about this album is, even though it's a double album, it isn't very long, (clocking in just over 80 minutes), and that there isn't any filler material, just more or less good songs that the band wanted to put out at the time.Personally the only songs I don't like are ""In my time of dying"" and ""In the light"", they arn't really that bad, it's just that they tend to drag on. I find myself skipping over these two songs when I listen to the album."
5,Led Zeppelin - 'Physical Graffiti' (Atlantic) 2-CD,"Review number 275.Originally released in 1975,'Physical...' is said by some to have been Zeppelin's last great album.I guess I can agree with that.Except,if you wish to include a couple of those later compilation discs.Hadn't heard most of the cuts on this outstanding double-disc gem for awhile now.Have always fully enjoyed the bluesy ""Custard Pie"",the eleven-minute ""In My Time Of Dying""(with Page's whinning guitar work-love it!),the snazzy ""Trampled Under Foot"",the Middle Eastern-influenced and unforgetable ""Kashmir"",the heavenly ""In The Light"" as well as a couple of the lp's acoustic pieces ""Black Country Woman"" and ""Boogie With Stu"".Total of fifteen songs,with a duration of approx. 96 minutes.Simply a must-have.Another great 2-CD offering,their 'Led Zeppelin-Box Set 2'(see my review)."
1,Not my cup of tea,I selected this album by mistake. Not a big fan of this kind of music. Nothing against Amazon. My experience was that of frustration for selecting the wrong button.
2,physical graffiti,"I do not think that this album is as good as a lot of their other albums; except for the songs: IN MY TIME OF DYING, and KASHMIR which are good."
3,Their Only Decent Album,"This is in my opinion their only good album. I dislike all the other junk albums of terrible bands like Led Zeppelin, BEATLES,and THE ROLLING STONES. This one has some of the greatest hardrock in Kashmir. Get it, but avoid all the other Led Zeppelin...Thanks."
1,A disappointing album.,"Frankly to say, I was very disappointed in this album. The album is too pretentious. It is an overindulgent double album. It is just an ornate piece rather than a timeless classic. It is the sound of self-indulgence rather than true inspiration. Some songs are not bad, but they are not enough to justify the numerous fillers. Nice cover, though."
5,a tmeless zeppelin double clasic,in the light down by the seaside wanton song and disk one are clasic zep
5,one of the best.,"GREAT CD ONE OF ZEPPELINS BEST ALL GREAT SONGS, NOT JUST WHAT YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO."
4,One heck of a rock album (Buy it for Kashmir),"Although Zepp's ""Physical Graffiti"" might not be as great or artistic as other double albums such as the Beatles' ""White Album"", Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"", or Bob Dylan's ""Blonde on Blonde"", this hard rock album represents a great time period for music, and Zeppelin. ""Custard Pie"" and ""Rover"" are okay, but the first disc's best tracks are the 11-minute ""In My Time of Dying"", ""Houses of the Holy"", and the mysterious ""Kashmir"".""Kashmir"", in my opinion, is one of their best songs, and possibly their very best in Zeppelin's 1975-1980 period.On their second disc, ""In the Light"" is good, but I'm a bit dissapointed at Graffiti's version of ""Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"". It is an acoustic only, with no vocals by Plant. I guess you'll have to buy ""Led Zeppelin 3"" or ""How the West was Won"" for the song with vocals. All in all, this is a must for every rock fan. I mysekf bought it for ""Kashmir"", ""Houses of the Holy"", and ""Wanton Song""."
5,"Double album, doubly good","To me, this is not THE best album by Zep, but certainly it's close to the top!The mix of songs on this CD is incredible! Although to truly enjoy this album, you need to be a hard-core Zeppelin fan, as most of the songs are very long.Included on this album is one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard, from ANY group - ""Bron-Y-Aur""."
4,Long Live Zep,"For being an original pressing of the album, the vinyl is in excellent condition. The cover was a little beat up, but I can understand that and am perfectly satisfied."
1,good cd ...,but i still give it only 1 star because the song 'house of the holy' is on this cd rather than on the cd called 'house of the holy' which just proves that led zeplin is stoners ...
3,Zep's Physical Graffiti,"This was good, but just didn't have enough Zep for two CD's.Lots of highlights, however. Great example of the glitter rock era."
5,Great Packaging...Great remaster!,"I love this album, and am so glad to finally see a miniature LP reissue. The die cut cover will remind you of the Stones' Some Girls and is a 'pocket' that holds the two cardboard sleeves with artwork on both sides. Each disc has a full color swan song logo. Expensive, but worth it."
5,long live rock and roll!,"In 1975 Led Zeppelin released their finest work(yes it is better than Led Zep 4)It is also undoubtedly the greatest heavy rock album of all time. Unsurpassed some 28 years after its release it is rock and roll at it's finest. With Page again producing(from his knowledge as a session musician), they had 8 songs for the new album, just a bit long for a single album. So they decided to go through the vast work they had left over from previous albums and had another 8 songs. These 15 songs would be released in 1975 to unprecedented critical praise and commercial success (a New York store said they were shifting 500 copies an hour!)The album highlights are the bluesy In My Time Of Dying, the epic In The Light, and without a doubt the greatest song ever recorded, the immense Kashmir. Any rock fan or of music in general haven't lived until they've heard this album."
5,Zeppelin at the top...,"Classic among classics, Physical Grafitti is arguably Zepplins finest work, THE MASTERPIECE. The band was soaring higher than anyone could dare reach again, even themselves. Tunes like Custard Pie, the Rover and In my time of Dying bring a new dimension to mere heavy metal. Listen to this album and you will see the real band that influenced hundreds of imitators. Soulful rifs like Houses of the holy and In the Light show one what true genius is. Kashmir stands alone as as the perfect rock dirge and as a stunning contrast to the forth albums Stairway to Heaven. This is the Mount Everest of rock albums, its all downhill from here. There is none better."
5,Timeless,"I have this CD for 15 years already. I went thru art-rock, psychodelia, jazz, fusion, avanguard, electronics since that but this recording it still fresh and still warms me up :). Whoever dares comparing Led Zeppelin to Deep Purple (rubbish!) or any other band just wastes time. LZP is something beyond comparison, something beyond boundaries."
4,led zep,"I only paid about a dollar to download this whole album. Thats a great price. I just wish I could burn a copy to CD so I can play it in my car. Maybe there's a better, more high tech way, to take this music with me. Currently I am unaware."
4,Surfin standby,"In 1962 the first of The Beach Boys albums took off and with it their career, right to the top the sounds and songs are great and so are they especially when Mike Love sings, cause he really makes the music come alive . Carl Wilson at the age of only 17 sounds good on the guitar as does Brian on Fender Bass and Denny on the Drums i really think GOD that they came when they did they started the California music saga as i am for certain from the instrumental Moon Dawg to the little ditty 409 they really turn you on"
3,attractive but frustrating,"Looks exactly like the picture when finally properly assembled. The directions were inadequate and the design made the piece harder and more frustrating to assemble than necessary. As is often the case with foreign made furniture, the directions left much to be desired.The price was good, it looks great now but I am reluctant to recommend it because of the assembly process."
5,Great,It arrived at my house very fast. Works great so far! Hopefully I wont need to get another one. Thanks
2,Disappointed,"This product is of low quality, it seems to be a knock off of the brand sharp crusher. The worst offense is the magnet, which I'm not even sure exists. There is no chance the lid will stay on unless you hold it there yourself. Although the shipping was fast, I would not recommend this to a friend, nor would I buy it again. After the cost shipping you should have enough money to go to a store and find a grinder with a magnet that actually works and is made of a more durable metal."
1,Will never buy aluminum again!,"When I got the grinder the top portion does grind very smooth, but when time to open the part that holds the grounded whatever you use it for it is almost impossible to remove. If you get lucky and get it open then the stupid thing won't go back together right. They have been very kind and work well in getting my refund."
3,Decent Grinder but could be better.,This grinder is an all around mid-quality grinder. It does the job it was made for at an average level.I would have liked it to have more teeth so that the grind was a little more fine.
3,Does what it is supposed to,"This is an okay herb grinder. It would be nicer if it could grind it up finer, but for the price, it's the best you can get."
5,Phantompalooza!,"Kessler's journey with Paul began at a fan event in Winnipeg, Canada, called Phantompalooza. (The 1974 film 'Phantom of the Paradise', starring Paul Williams, was a freak hit here (Google it!)). Paul treated a packed house to a concert of his hits and several Phantom songs. Those of us in attendance will never forget the emotional bond between audience and performer, and I'm pleased to see that some of the concert footage from that magical evening is in this wonderful documentary."
4,Very good but....,"Engaging documentary though somehow I can't help but feel that it needed more Paul. Is that possible? I think what I'm wanting is to see more of his actual clips; to see him do his thing. The evolving relationship between Kessler and Williams, while interesting to track thru the film just isnt compelling enough to send this film to the threshold of greatness. Still, eminently watchable and it does ignite an interest in Paul's work thu the 60's 70's and 80's and makes one glad that he did indeed survive the excesses. I also enjoyed the newer song that played in the closing credits...."
4,Paul Williams is very much alive and kicking,"I am a Paul Williams fan so enough said. Of course I love biographies about famous people thus I really liked this one. I thought the filmmaker was very truthful in depicting his love for Paul Williams and it felt good to see Paul being sober and sane, finally. Really would like to meet him as most of his songs are ones you can't forget and keep singing over the ages. They never get old in my mind. The man is a true talent and I sincerely hope he writes another fabulous song and gets recognized all over again at the oscars and by his peers."
3,"kinda cool, kinda disappointing...","The documentarian was too big of a fan to push for the real story, more of a movie about him trying to make a documentary and instead becoming pals with his subject.Paul williams seems like a good dude though who shows remorse for his poor behavior in the past."
1,worthless,"Was supposed to come in white but instead came in some kind of yellowish fade. It looks like the package was stored in a smoke room for several years. Besides, unless your wiremold setup is perfectly square, it is really hard to fit in. This item is going straight to the trash since it would cost more to return it than the item itself. I think it is better to cut some extra cover in diagonal than to use this."
5,Great product,"Brilliant Brunette is the best hair care product I have used. I was so upset not to find it in local stores any more, but thrilled when I was able to get it on Amazon. My hair can look dull, drippy and oh so want to be covered up. But a teeeny bit of Brunette Shine Shock (for those old enough, remember ""A little dab will do you"") brings my hair back to wonderful life.John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Shine Shock, Leave On Perfecting Glosser 2.4 oz (68 g)"
3,"Very shiny, but leaves hair limp","This product definitely made my hair shine and a little bit goes a long way. I have hair that is about a quarter of an inch past my shoulders and I used an amount just smaller than the size of a dime (sometimes even less). It works best on damp hair. I added a few drops of water to it when I applied it to dry hair. My biggest complaint is that within 6 hours of application, the areas of my hair that I applied the product to became oily and limp. Great for touch ups before going out at night, but not good for all day wear. It didn't seem to matter how little I used, the result was always the same (I have fine hair).Not a bad product, but I'm looking for something less oily that I can wear all day."
5,long lost gem,"I had seen it when it came out but when I rediscovered it on DVD, it wasso Laugh out Loud funny. A brilliant hymn to movies and the script is just a delight. Such a treat to see so many old gems in one film. A real treasure to own..."
3,Ruff Film,"OK, it was funnier when I was in college. Or maybe old age is getting me and I just thought it was. This could have been such a great movie...great story but no plot after 20 minutes. Glad they used so many Silent screen stars...but the movie lost steam as they tried to be clever. It never works but the studios keep trying...Might be good for the kids or if you want to see Buster Keaton and peers, some for the last time..."
3,great lost classic from ringo,"This album is great. I rank it as one of my faves, along with beaucoups of blues, blast from your past, and vertical man. great guitar work by joe walsh"
4,Nice robe!,"Nice quality robe, my girlfriend loves it! Seems a bit long but its OK as it is very high quality."
4,Comfortable but heavy,"Comfortable and well made.This robe is heavy, compared to most other robes I've used. My wife found it too heavy for her comfort.The outer shell doesn't breathe much. Make sure to turn it inside out to dry, whenever you put it on after a shower, etc.I didn't and the inside got some mold spots."
4,Classy and snuggly,"This robe looks and feels great. There were only 2 things which were only slightly disappointing:1. The color--in the picture it looks to be blue, but when it arrived, it appears to be more of a ""greyish"" tone2. The inside lining is a very thin terry cloth--it may fluff up after I wash it, but it is thinner than I would have hoped.Overall, I would recommend this item--very nice."
1,out $95.00,I purchased this and gave it to my wife for christmas. But she wanted a lighter weight robe than this. so i followed the return instructions and sent it back to the company. They say they didnt receive it and amazon wont refund my money. Sent through US post office and i have the receipt that i paid for it and shipped it. I don't get it.
5,Beautiful Robe,"After reading the other reviews I decided to go ahead and order this robe. I wanted a lighter weight robe that wasn't velour or fleece because I get too hot. I usually wear an XL and I wanted to have plenty of coverage so I ordered the XL. WAY TOO BIG. In my opinion this robe is sized for men. My husband tried it on because he liked the looks of it but thought it was too heavy. He wants a really light weight robe.It's beautiful and feminine in the pink but I need to return the robe and get a smaller size. I can't wait to get it. It seems very good quality and just the right weight to be able to wear both winter and summer.It has two sets of belt loops so the belt can be adjusted up or down some. I am 5'7"" and this robe came almost to my ankles."
5,I made the right decision!,"I got it in my head that i wanted the type of robe you get at spas but wasn't exactly sure how to find one. I read a lot of reviews and apparently a lot of robes are described as ""luxury"" and ""spa.""I'm so glad I found this one because it definitely feels right. I like the heaviness of it -- very cozy and comforting. It's soft too.Maybe it's not for everyone but it's what I was looking for."
2,looks like old man pants,"Sorry, I can't agree with the rest. The medium rests at the most unfortunate height (I'm slim and 5'6""), it's soft but not luxurious, but most of all... the outer fabric looks like old man pants. I am sure it's functional, but it's just not flattering for a woman."
2,Not a flattering fit.,I purchased this item because of the high ratings. I was surprised to see how unflattering the fit was. My husband actually laughed when I tried it on. The fabric and feel was very nice but the cut seems more suited for a man.
2,not worth the money,"when i ordered this for myself i was very excited. it had a classic look and i dont usually splurge on a luxury item; with that said, i can see wearing for a spa day but not for everyday use. the sizes do run very large and it loses the tailored apperance that drew me to it in the first place."
3,Good Robe High Price,Robe is a little heavy and long but is nice to wrap in when getting out of the shower. Isn't exactly what I am looking for but better than any robe I have found in any brick and mortar department stores.
5,Great Present,"I ordered this for my wife a long time ago for X-Mas since she needed a robe. It is a very nice robe and I couldn't of asked for any better. My wife absolutely loves this thing, She wears it almost every night. I highly recommend this product and am glad I purchased it as a present."
4,Way more fun than regular patterns,"It's like the Gang of Four had a little too much to drink (or something) at a National Lampoon party and went home and wrote a sequel. I think my favorite pattern is goTo guy, which is prefaced with a note that the article ""GoTo Considered Harmful"" doesn't apply to dating patterns. Haven't tried any of the patterns since my SO disapproves strongly of multithreading."
1,the description is wrong,These are not 4x speed discs. These are 2x speed discs. I'll be returning my order.
1,junk,"does not work with my philips divx dvd player, the video files are on the disk but player can not recognize them, fuji-film is much better"
4,Great for use with DVD recorder,These work great with my Toshiba DVD recorder. I have been recording on the same TDK DVD-RW disk over and over again with no adverse issues.I would not hesitate to buy this again for DVD recorder use.
4,GT2 is great fun for the money...,"The Escort Passport GT2 is a powerful tool and a fun toy, especially considering it's low price and ease of use. It is useful for analyzing vehicle performance as well as honing your driving skills. It has lot's of display modes to show G forces as well as 0-60 times and more. You just suction cup it to the windshield, plug it into the cig lighter and go."
5,A Diamond in the Rough,"Despite having read hundreds (literally) of fantasy novels, none surpass this truly outstanding trilogy. Well, there was Tolkien of course..., but as I like to say: The Lord of the Rings is the best, but The Winter of the World is my favorite. While it is true that the story starts out in a North American-like continent, it is not obvious until viewing the second and third novel's maps. The Anvil of Ice deals with a man who starts as a cattleherder and develops into a powerful smith. He has to deal with many inner conflicts; these continue on throughout the trilogy. Outer conflict comes from the servants of the evil that is the Ice. Definitely a book that all fantasy lovers should read (too bad it is so difficult to find a copy)."
5,Cool and versatile,"Pros:-Beautiful watch, gotten lots of compliments-Easy to adjust the length of the bracelet-Unique, ""edgy"" style-Can go with dressy or casual outfits-Only had it for a few weeks, but it seems pretty sturdy and well made. This watch is very shiny, and I was worried that it'd scratch easily, but it still looks brand new.-Nice size/weight, but that's a subjective thing. I tend to like watches on the bigger side.Cons:None"
3,NICE BUT TRICKY,"I LOVE THIS WATCH BUT MY WRIST IS SMALL AND EVEN THO U CAN TAKE LINKS OUT, IT WAS TO SMALL OR TO BIG.."
2,Size differs from identical pant in black.,"The rise , ( measurement from center front waist to center back waist between the legs), is 2 "" less than identical pair in black purchased last year."
3,Not quite up to Molinari standards,"Ordered this online because we'd been missing it since moving to Ohio from California.It arrived quickly and well packaged.Unfortunately, the two salame's were both far too hard and somewhat greasy, indicating they were a bit old - unlike the fresh, slightly soft, direct from the producer product we're used to. Just not up to standards so we'll be buying our next supply directly from Molinari (or having some friends ship us a 'care' package).Molinari is the epitome of Milano salame (frankly, Milan doesn't have any as good as Milano's made in the Bay Area product) so do yourself a favor and get it direct via Milano's internet sales."
1,Waste of money.....,This was a total waste of money. Spend the extra cash and buy a gage which mounts between the tank and the regulator.
2,Gas level,Really hard to see the indicator where it tells you that you need to replace gas in your tank... Should have made it with brighter colors so it would be easier to see........
1,Grossed out,"God! Do you really expect anyone to purchase this product with the visuals you offer? They look like the ""before"" pictures from a hospital burn unit....."
5,Courage to be Christian,"If you didn't understand the responsibility that comes with Christianity before, you certainly would after reading this book. It was insightful, easy to read, easy to follow but most of all applicable to my Christian journey."
2,bad cutting of filters,"I have found that there are many filters with the side trimmed short and enven only 1/2 filters in the bundle. Will try to find another brand that has high side to stop grounds overflowing filter paper,Not of the same quality of the Bunn coffee maker!!"
2,"these are not 6"" filters!!","I was very disappointed that the size of these filters were described as being 6"" -- they absolutely are not! They are the same 12-cup 3-4"" tall filters that you can buy cheaper everywhere else. I really needed taller filters and bought these and feel quite misled."
1,Filters do not fit my Bunn phase brew coffee maker as advertised,"Although I ordered the filters that were noted by Amazon to fit my Bunn phase brew coffee maker, these are too large. I don't know whether Amazon shipped me the wrong product or if the advertising itself was wrong -- and it is not worth my cost and trouble of return shipment. I will buy my filters from the Bunn website in the future. I am not a satisfied Amazon customer in this case."
4,Soup Lover,"Thank you Amazon for delivering this item right away. I was excited to receive my Food Mill in time to make Winter Squash Soup for our department potluck. Previously I had used my blender to accomplish the texture I wanted only to have soup you could drink from a straw. The Mill allowed me to receive the desire texture I was seeking and my peers loved the smooth texture of the soup. The design of the Mill is very sleek, easy to use/clean and compact for storage. I don't know how to make jams or other products for storage, but I am so happy with this tool I am researching other food items I can use my mill with. I love it."
4,Meets My Needs,"I purchased this product to make homemade baby food for my baby girl. I have used the food mill once so far to make sweet potatoes for her. It was very easy to use, did a good job and was very easy to clean (dishwasher safe). I plan on continuing to use this food mill to make her other fruit and veggie purees. I would recommend this product to someone who is looking for a mid-range priced food mill to make homemade babyfood."
2,terrible for mashed potatoes,"I bought this food mill as a cheap option to pass mashed potatoes instead of using a more expensive mill.Problems:it doesn't push the potatoes well enough. the angle of the blade makes it necessary to use a spatula to keep ""feeding"" the mill.It also requires a small bowl due to the three ""legs"" so if you try to do any milling of any significance over a large bowl, good luck.For tiny jobs it's OK. For anything of significance, save money and get a bigger mill.You get what you pay for, I wish I could return this thing."
4,Doesn't work as well as I thought,"It sounded good, but it's smaller than I thought. Also the space between the mill and the bottom is a bit too small that when the food is not small enough, it simply passes over the mill, and you have to keep pushing it in. But besides those problems, it does what it's supposed to do, and it's well-built."
4,Great food mill!,"Finally a food mill of pretty good quality that's not going to cost you over $100! A few years ago I purchased a food mill from Crate and Barrel for about $35..what a MISTAKE!!! The thing nearly sliced my fingers off each time I struggled to remove the blade from being jammed into the bowl. Still, I wasn't ready to dish out $100+ for a food mill. The OXO is very easy to assemble & disassemble and works well. One thing I'd tweak is the length of the retractable legs- wish they were a bit longer to be able to hang over larger bowls."
3,OXO Good Grips Food Mill,"Works well enough for smaller jobs. I have been canning tomatoes and using it almost everyday since it arrived. I have been using the medium disk and it seems not to be working quite as well with all of the tomatoes that I have put through it. The knob on the handle has come off. It does not screw on and I am not sure how it was secured in the first place but, it will not stay on. Also, the one leg will not stay up. It has become loose."
4,My newest favorite kitchen gadget,"I received this in time to tackle a bumper crop of tomatoes. Instead of having a freezer full of peeled tomatoes, I have them all in tomato sauce. Worked better than my potato ricer for making my Thanksgiving mashed potatoes. The potato ricer will go to the Goodwill"
5,It's the little things that make this great,"The rubber feet that fit over various sized bowls and don't slide, the different sieves that can be inserted for different levels of milling. Perfect for all of your food mill needs."
1,Doesn't work,"I have always liked OXO tools and found them to be of really high quality. This is an exception. This food mill is a royal FAIL. I am on a low carb diet and wanted to use this to make ""mock"" rice out of cauliflower. I tried cutting raw cauliflower very small pieces nut it didn't work. I then cooked it until it was softer. All that this thing does is get jammed up with a layer of food stuck between the grating surface and the turning blade. I checked the instruction booklet and made sure I had assembled it correctly with the cone facing up. there is just a hugh gap between the grater and the blade. Don't waste your money."
5,Excellent,"I have a green thumb and my vegetable garden produces way more than expecations every year.This year I decided to try using up the excess by making soups and other goodies.Step one, buy a food mill and based on price and reviews I chose the OXO.Step two, test it by using up some of the pile of tomatoes from my harvest.I decided to make tomato paste and ran 5 Lbs of tomatoes through the fine plate.Amazing, not a seed or skin escaped and the 5 Lbs of tomatoes yielded less than 2 cups of ""waste"".What is not to like, nice to look at, easy to set up and use, effective, easy to clean.Who cares about no scraper wire, that's what wooden spatulas are for.The downside, my neighbors will not be getting much in the way of free produce this year."
4,Not bad,"This is certainly not a piece of precision engineering, but it does get the job done. I've found that the crank, when decoupled from the body, will often work itself into such a position as to render itself frozen, and wiggling it loose can sometimes take a moment as you struggle to figure out which way it needs to move to unstick itself. The discs are also a little uneven, making for some unpleasant scraping noises when you pass over the high spots.Nevertheless, it did make short work of a can of mangosteens, and cleanup was fairly painless. Not sure how long it'll last since that ""enameled"" exterior is really molded plastic, but we'll see."
4,"It's a lot of work, but worth it","Product worked very well, but you have to enjoy it as a love of labor. Its so easy to buy those Rao's."
2,Difficult to use...,The legs on this food mill do not stay in place. It is difficult to use. I would not buy this one.
2,I vote for Food processror,I was looking for some equipment to make bisque... If you would try to make some thick spinach soop- it would be impossible... Takes a lot of your energy and time and no results... So I bought food processor for this and now I'm finaly statisfied.
2,Another Gadget!,"In response to my wifes request I purchased the food mill, while the construction was fine, the execution,assemble, processing eventual cleanup in my opinion was way to involved compared to a plain masher for mashed potatoes! Other processes may make the mill worth it, but for now, it seems ""the long way around""!"
2,havent had long enough.,I got this machine at end of canning season. I think it will be good on next years tomatoes.I will see
2,Disappointed,I have always wanted a potato ricer ... this one is rather ungainly and ackward to use. Perhaps a hand-held version would have been better.
3,it is ok but...,"it is an ok mill. Steamed carrots are a little tough to push thu, but i ended up griding with with the coarse plate first, then the fine for babybood.so it works.one thing i am really astonished with, and why i give it a 3 instead of 5, is that they did not think it prudent to make a ""scraper wire"" on the bottom, so now you have to lift up the mill and manually scape off the food bits, so you can work at a good speed.another issue is that the legs are mounted in such a way that the nicely shaped ""i promise to fit in many pots"" body actually does not - the nubs of the hinges are in the way."
1,Broke after light usage,"Purchased the OXO Good Grips Food Mill a couple of years ago and used it lightly, Thanksgiving and Christmas meals mostly. It broke recently, one of the two clips to retain the handle assembly popped off. I found it difficult to work with compared to the old school Foley mill I used to have. I would not recommend this product."
2,OXO food mill - would not recommend,This food mill is in need of a lot of redesign. The legs are extremely slippery when wet and will not sit on a pot or bowl. Material selection for the legs is poor. I would not recommend this unit.
1,not what I was hoping for,"Was not able to mash spinach. There is something wrong between paddle and the blade, it doesn't work very well. I have seen some comments and just have to say that this is not my first food mill and I know how to use it. It just doesn't work how it should."
1,Does not work well,"The spring is so tight that you can barely turn the handle, and it literally scrapes metal off the blade beginning with the very first turn. Also, the handle goes crooked with every turn and has to be straightened out (going in reverse a quarter turn works) on every turn. It also does not separate seeds (e.g. watermelon) -- it grinds them up and they pass through the blade. I will never use it again so I should just throw it out, although it is difficult to throw away something brand new. I checked the instructions several times -- they are so simple that I can't see how I am doing anything wrong. I recommend you buy a more standard model. This one is worthless."
3,OXO Food mill,"So, so results. Bought this to puree baby foods from home meals. Works OK for softer food but not so well for foods like meats or coarser veggies."
5,Works great - lightweight but sturdy,Well worth the price - used for mashed potatoes at thanksgiving and made a world of difference. High quality materials - easy to clean - comes with 3 blades - large enough to do large quantities but small enough that it can easily be stored.
5,"Easy to use, great design, recommended product!","I just used this for the first time making 8 quarts of applesauce. It worked wonderfully - reducing the amount of time needed for applesauce making because you only need to quarter whole apples, cook them until tender and then ladle your apples into the food mill for ""processing."" With this food mill there is no need to peel apples or even core them as the mill catches both of these products when you turn the crank. This made applesauce making a breeze and I cannot wait to use it for making marinara next summer! I wish it had a larger capacity as I had to disassemble frequently (which is relatively quick) to remove the seeds and skin that accumulated and then re-attach the mill crank to continue processing more apples. The rubberized legs grip the top of a bowl or saucepan nicely. I recommend this product."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed that this mill did not work well. It finally got the job done but not quickly. I used it for tomato sauce and to make apple sauce. It did not push down on the lower screen enough to work well. Perhaps this was a defective one. We checked it again and again to make sure we set it up correctly, and we had. The cheap one we bought in Italy worked better, and we had hoped to find a better one than that. I do not recommend buying this. On the plus side, Amazon does make it very easy to do a return and that went quickly."
2,Worked great for 2 years,"I bought this in summer of 2009 and used it for applesauce, marinara, pureed veggies and mashed potatoes. It worked great for 2 summers and then at the end of last summer the blade started to slip. The handle would turn but the blade would stay put. If I turned it backwards for half a turn, I'd get a few more turns out of it. This summer, it works for about 20 turns total and then does the same thing. If I take it apart and wash it with soap and water it will work for about another 20 turns. I took it completely apart and tightened the rubber washer that holds the pieces tightly together at the bottom, but it slips again after 20 turns or so. Before this started, I would've rated it 5 stars and kept it forever. Now, it is not worth taking up space in my pantry. I'm going to try the Kitchenaid stand mixer food grinder attachment instead."
3,Good mill for limited tasks,This food mill is handy for a limited range of kitchen uses and I am not certain it is worth the price. I have found that it will work for mashing potatoes but that it is much easier to just use a fork to mash them. I have used it successfully to make applesauce and to get the seeds and skins out of tomatoes after I have stewed them for sauce. The three legs make it very sturdy and it works very easy.This is a good little tool to have in the kitchen but it has a limited range or applications and may not be worth the purchase.
5,Almost everything you need!,"Got this for the Wilton classes I was taking...boy, was I the envy of the class. The teacher used my kit to show everyone else all the things they might need. I did buy a few extra tips and more bags, but this comes with (almost) everything but the cake!"
4,Tool Set with Storage Caddy Review,This is a great product - my only criticism is that it could be a little bigger. The top tray does not fit snugly into the container once it is filled with other items that are also included in the kit.
3,Not what I expected!!!!!,"I was really happy with the caddy when it arrived, but when I opened it, I found that one of the featherweight decorating bags wasn't a Wilton product. Also, the cake decorating book was poorly packed; it was covered by the rest of the stacked items and was kind of folded so now it is kind of impossible to properly hold the book down!! I was expecting something better than that."
5,great kit for those interested,This Kit has almost everything. My wife really likes it and has enjoyed using all of the components that come with it. The caddy makes storage of everything easy too.
4,Decorating cake getting easy ;),"I got this to start decorating cakes by myself and it workd very good. It has all needed things, but you might need few other stuff that are extra but not neccessary. I did not like the cady but it is good to protect the tools :) if you are a beginner in decorating then this is a good thing for you and it has the book with instructions as well :)"
4,Cant wait to use it,Ilove making cakes and have just started using the books to learn more. I just purchased this item. I cant wait to use it. I found this item at at J***ns on clearance for 79.99.
1,Inadequate and fraught with errors,"As an old QuarkXPress user looking for an instructional aid, I was quite disappointed in this book: the exercises are painful and unnecessarily convoluted. The topics are not organized logically. Support files do not display correctly on Windows machines (Mac EPSs lacking previews). But worse than that, this book is full of errors. Frequently, the wrong keyboard commands are given, instructions are omitted or incomplete. Some information is false: ""Pages exported as EPS are raster -- not vector..."" This is incorrect. Try ""Teach Yourself QuarkXPress in 14 Days"" by Kate Binder instead."
5,Island Grenada HIstory,I'm very happy I bought this book. I have learned alot on my family history and their Island where they lived.How the first people arrived their and their history.IT even mentions my second Great Grandmothers Father's name and who he was andwhat he did.Thank you so much
5,excelent single from bloc party,"i highly recomend picking up this new single from Bloc Party. it's just amazing... better than anything off Silent Alarm... if they keep going at this rate, the new cd is going to a musically amazing"
4,"Good book, but don't pay too much","This is indeed a very interesting work. However, the price it is offered for here ($188 when I checked today) is far too high. According to the website www.ringmakersofsaturn.com, it is available new for $59. Check into that before you drop too much cash."
2,My copy is for sale,"My mind is certainly open to new paradigms otherwise I would not have purchased this book many years ago. Based on the evidence presented in the book the claims are without proof. Still it's a grand idea and entertaining. My copy was read twice by me and put away in the book shelf where it has remained without being ever handled again. Evidently, it's quite the collector's item."
3,Found the battery only for $27.00,"I called the 800 number listed in another review and was able to get the replacement battery for about $27.00I have the charger, so that isn't a problem. My local hardware stores were unable to get the battery, so this is a good solution for me."
3,Replacement Battery Alternative,"If you are having trouble finding a replacement battery for the Ryobi electric trimmer like I was, you can order one for $8.95 + shipping from Rage Battery in San Diego (858-376-1320). Ask for the PS-1270F2, Power-Sonic 12 Volt 7.0 Amp Hour, terminals F2. It's the same size as the battery that comes with the Ryobi."
2,Don't worry! This is a very common battery size.,"Roybi put a spacer around terminals that makes you think the battery is ""special"", but any 12-V 7.0 amp,(or 7.2 amp) will fit & work perfectly! They are available online and most any local battery store, like BatteriesPlus. Expect to pay anywhere from fourteen to twenty-five buckos!"
1,update on ryobi 300028 155r battery:,I just tried to order this patr directly from ryobi #800 345 8746. I was told that it is a special order item only now and is $50.00. this is very upsetting that a battery would cost about 50% of what I paid for the product about two years ago. I also find it very irresponsible of ryobi to let it's customers (former) down in this way. I am writting a letter to them expressing my discontent in this matter. I would suggest that anyone who is the same situation do the same. Our $100.00 plus tool has become garbage as far as I am concerned. I am going to take my $50.00 and by a trimmer that will be supported by its manufacturer.
2,Alternative battery,"I assume no liability for this suggestion. The Douglas (...) 12-7-f battery will fit in the case and is a 12v 7AH lead acid sealed battery, and is cheaper."
1,Can't use what you can't get!,"This item is impossable to get! Ryobi does not retail it in any stores that I have found, and I have tried twice to order it through Amazon only to have it cacled by them because ""it is not available from any of our sources at this time"". So why do I see it all over the internet? I have wasted 3 months trying to purchase it. I don't know who is more at fault Ryobi or Amazon. I do know I will not be doing business with either again."
4,BATTERY PURCHASE,"Your listing shows only the battery with complete recharging kit. All I need is a battery. I have been unable to locate it anywhere. Your page is the closest I have been able to get, but you don't offer the battery by itself."
3,Beware- this is NOT Autographed !!!,"I bought this item because it was supposed to be a (Ltd Ed-Autograph), but when I received it after a few days (Very quickly, I'll give them that), it was NOT signed by Rob Halford or any of the other members of Fight.I was promptly offered a full refund, I'll give them that as well. But I see the item is still listed as (Ltd Ed-Autograph). Beware!"
4,Good board,This is the 2nd biostar motherboard that i have owned. I have not had any problems with it. They make a good product at a very reasonable price.
1,Not a very happy customer.,Hard to get a hold of this company and a lot of trouble to return defective items.
4,Canada great,This is a band that should get more recognition. Too bad they dont get any radio play......maybe its better that way.
1,UNSATISFACTORY,"NEVER RECEIVED THIS ITEM VERY UNHAPPY!!!! Havent even received an email after we told them we did not not recieve it, i always was scared that this might happen and i don't think i will order anything from online again!!!"
3,Mixed bag,"Lister is a great guitar player no doubt. Some great chops on this album too! However he see tries to cover too many styles of music with this effort that you end up not sure what to think. Now, I favor blues music, but like rock or folky style stuff too. When you mix pop in there I start to wonder - it sure is more than everything I need. I hope he, with future releases, will continue to hone in on HIS style. I will continue listen for it. All this being said, I DO recommend this CD - 50% of the songs on here are really good."
3,Amazon Warning,"Do NOT order & try to download full albums from Amazon if you are or dial-up internet!!! WHEN you get disconnected you can't go back & resume download!!!I was able to retry after asking Amazon but on the first retry of a single song (12mb) I was disconnected (I guess??). Now I guess I have to ask again.Alot of time to put in to just getting a $7.99 CD !!!Yes I'm living like an animal on dial-up in 2009!. That is another story, Can't get DSL from ATT even though they torn up my driveway to run fiber-optic lines.Oh and Aynsley Lister is a darn good player (from what I've heard so far)."
5,Devastates Christian Belief and the character of Jesus,This is one of the best critiques of the Christian Religion ever written. Russell amply demonstrates that Jesus' character was far from perfect and that Jesus was not the most admirable man who ever lived. For all those not afraid of thinking for themselves.
4,Critical thinking,"A book worth the time to read, with a bit of this and a bit of that. I especially enjoyed the initial Why I am Not a Christian, a piece on Thomas Paine, and the appendix about Bertrand Russell being denied a teaching position because he was openly an atheist. In America!"
4,this book will change your life,"This book is excellent, because it examines parts of our culture that we are not ""supposed"" to examine. Read this, then read Carl Sagan's ""The Demon-Haunted World"", and you will be on the road to truth instead of fantasy."
4,A rational explanation of faith,"I bought the book driven mainly by the title. What I found is a collection of essays about religion that go far beyond Christianity. I personally share Mr. Russell's comments so my reviewed will be undoubtedly biased, but I can say that every argument is clearly and exceptionally grounded in facts. And since faith and facts don't always walk together, a rationale explanation of faith is not possible unless you do it from an atheist point of view.What I personally enjoyed the most is the appendix: ""How Bertrand Russell was prevented from teaching at The College of the City of New York"". It is a clear example of the limits to freedom of speech that can be found in America. Many years after that, some people are still discussing whether to teach Darwin at US schools..."
3,The Yokel's Insight,"It sadly is but commonplace today that free-thinker as a general label has become an autantonym. Of course Religion is irrational, just like everything else that is important in our lives. Religion belongs to Feeling, and Feeling is orthogonal to Reason - the point where the two meet being the debate on the existence of a God-whatever-you-call-it. That someone needs to read Russell in order to find that out says enough about the reader's mind agility and, regretably, even more about that kind of author's well known intelectual merits when put to the service of self-praise. Three stars overall go to the book's undeniable worth as atheistic soap. A must read for the fan, forgettable for everyone else."
4,Why I am Not a Christian,"If I were to write an essay with the same title, it would consist of just the following sentence: ""Because I have an IQ score in the triple digits."" The fact that Russell takes several thousand words to say what I just said in ten doesn't mean that his work is not essential reading."
1,Reply,"""A relentless pursuit of God, a relentless pursuit of the people He loves"" It's a relationship, not a religion. YAKADOO!"
1,THINK ABOUT IT,"Isn't it interesting that Mr. Russell claims that all religions are shackles to the mind, but yet why is it that only Christians are attacked, even the title of this book is WHY I AM NOT A CHIRSTIAN, well if it's true that Mr., Russell believes this of all religions why is only Christianity attacked? Why is it that out of all the religious leaders in history of all the religions only Christ is made fun of, only Christ is repeatedly sought out to be disproved...Because HE IS THE TRUTH. The world and things of this world will never understand that. But lies will always attack the truth. Granted there are fanatics to every religion, but if you want to know the truth find a REAL Christian. They are rare to be found but there are still a few."
5,Never mind the bollocks...,"An incredible, clearly-written, thoroughly-argued masterpiece of human intelligence, and a clarion call for the fight against muddle-headed mysticism. This book gives me hope for a rational, sane future."
4,A must for everyone (including Christians),"There have been many contradictory opinions about Bertrand Russell's ideas on religions (esp. Christianity) and our way of life. This book expresses his general thought, and is therefore a good introductory book to Bertrand Russell's brilliant work. Before reading this book, I recommend everyone (who is interested) to first OPEN HIS/HER MIND AND BE AN INTELLIGENT AND REASONABLE READER. You do not have to agree with him to see his points. Personally, I do not totally agree with him, but I do give him a lot of credits. There are many things you can learn from his philosophy. Sit tight and start reading, and if you do not get 'fed up' when you finish reading this book, you have been an intelligent reader (either agreeing or not agreeing with him). Enjoy!!!"
1,Missing Essay,"Here is an excellent set of essays indeed. However, I was disappointed to find that one essay 'What I Believe' (about 30 pages) was left out of this publication. I bought the book because the pages are falling out of my much older copy (Allen & Unwin, 1967) and I was particularly interested in this essay. Although the book purports to be a full reprint of a valuable modern classic, there is no mention of the omission. Perhaps if I buy another book from this publisher (Routledge) I will find the essay. Other recent publications include the essay. Look around before you buy."
2,Simple Thought...,"I endeavored to buy this book AND C.S. Lewis's ""Mere Christianity"", simply to see what is talked about that is similar. My simple thought is this: as an atheist, I read Russell's book first, and mostly agreed on many of his points. I then read Mere Christianity, and after that, re-read ""Why I am Not a Christian"". It became clear to me that the things Lewis says emphasizes a much different point than most of Russell's book. Lewis's book delves deeply into why being Christian makes sense; Russell's book is relatively miniscule in discussing truly deep reasons why NOT being a Christian makes sense. My suggestion? Read ""Why I am Not a Christian"" online--if you like it and you want more essays to read, get this book. Otherwise, this book simply fails to concentrate on what the title implicates the book is going to be about."
4,Eye opener,"This book is old and in some parts hard to read. But it's really an eye opener, especially for religious people like many of my friends and family."
1,Ideas expressed here are simple and common,"I purchased this publication anticipating some analytical explanation as to, ""Why he was not a Christian"" unfortunately this entire book stated only elementary ideas and, quite honestly I was to the point that I wanted the book to end. The entire appendix, (1/4 of the book) consists of the court battle Russell had with the state of NY. Evidently Russell has simply congregated a assortment of his most rudimentary essays and attempted to structure a coherent, logical book. He has failed miserably...."
1,A classical house of straw!,"When I was assigned to read this book in seminary I dreaded reading it because I thought it would destroy my Faith. But,quite the contrary it showed me how the secularlist sees Christianity and the approach that a non-believer takes with discrediting the Christian Faith and God. It made my Faith stronger than ever. This book is a valuable resource to get a good survey of the subject matter, but it fails to be convincing in it's anti-God argument. JER Memphis, TN"
3,Should be read with understanding,"Christians should read this in the same way that atheists and agnostics should read C.S. Lewis. To understand the other side of the issue.Russell is uncompromisingly agnostic. He approaches Christian and religious thought/dogma in an unbalanced way (i.e. he doesn't attempt to look at the good; just the bad).I'm reminded of another atheist (Oscar Wilde) who said, ""A cynic knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.""Russell dwells on the fears and emotions that organized religion exploits in order to convince and maintain converts. While all but ignoring any good that comes from religious thought and traditions.But, if you are a Christian, and are confused about the fundamental problems that we atheists and agnostics have with your faith, this book puts them all out there in no uncertain terms.It serves as an excellent mouthpiece to address our key issues, but is very unfair in its value judgments of Christianity on the whole."
3,Okay book,"Russell's arguments against Christianity are excellent, but the book is boring at times. I know it's a collection of essays, but some of the essays were quite boring, and didn't even talk about religion and Christianity. It still is a decent book. I just wish that I only read the parts on Christianity, and skipped the rest."
5,"Somewhat dated, but still powerful","Although some of the individual arguments in the book are not as strong as others, and more modern philosophers have made better arguments against Christianity, there is still much to recommend in this book. It's more an attack against superstitious thinking in general, and a call for people to examine their beliefs and how they affect how they live their lives. There is a great deal of charm to the way he writes, and he was certainly much kinder towards Christians than many Christians had been towards him! Some of the sections do seem dated, but one must remember how long ago this book was written to fully appreciate it. Recommended as a great start for people questioning their spirituality or philosophy -- but don't stop here."
2,Burning strawmen,"As mathematician,Russell was a giant.As philosopher,he was quite the hack.After Wittgenstein shredded Russell's philosophical systems in the 1910's,he afterword became more polemicist than philosopher.Anyway,what this book highlights above all else is how even a man of genius can be blind to himself.Russell puts out a hit on every Christian strawman he found and generally scorned religion as such.But just like Shaw,Heidegger and other men of the age,he found a substitute religion in the form of Utopian movements as exemplified by Communism,Socialism etc.It is rather amusing when people like Russell clain no religion,conveniently blind to the fact that all people have a religion whether they know it or not.Skip this two-bit hack and read some Nietzsche."
2,Internet is better,"Personally, I think the Christian religion is stupid. Russell's book does not contain as much information on Christianity's weakness as could be found on the internet."
2,Kindle publications.,As a critical observer of neo-liberalism I have sensed a reluctance by Kindl to include publications that are critical neo-liberal views. Am I wrong?
3,Christmas Gadget,This was a Christmas gift for a ten year old girl. The diary opened for any word and not just the password. The recipient was disappointed.
5,Good choice,"My daughther loves it, it works well and its fun for young kids, easy to use for them. I bought it on sale and find the price super!"
1,Very Disappointing Product,"My daughter received this product for her 6th birthday. She was very excited because it was supposed to open only for her password. Well, it opened for every password no matter what you said or who said it. We tried to reset it over and over again hoping that it would actually work. It did once for a minute and then went back to malfunctioning. I exchanged it at the store for another one hoping that we happened to have a defective one. The second one, however, does the same thing as the first. It was very frustrating to have two in a row that didn't work. I told a friend about our problems with the product. She said that her daughter has one of these also and that it does not work properly. Anyhow, this appears to be a very poorly manufactured product and expensive to boot. I think that I have finally convinced my daughter to return this product and to spend her $20 on something less aggravating."
2,Things pretty much the same in John Irving's world,"It is a competent, interesting book but not much more than that. After reading Hotel, Garp, Bears, and Meany; I have noticed they all tread similar ground. There is the mostly ineffectual narrator, there are the characters who thrive because of the quirks & fallacies not in spite of them, there are the same catchphrases repeated over and over, there is the continued fascination and reliance on Vienna as a plot device. Don't get me wrong, Hotel is an OK book. Some good observations are made like ""we pick up our Chipper Dove's only to put them back down again"" or Lilly's euphimism for writing. Irving also probably uses foreshadowing better than any other writer. But I felt after Garp & Bears, this is the 3rd time I have basically read the same story. Owen Meany diminutive frame still towers over the rest of Irving's works."
4,Irving's saddest hour?,"Those readers with the stomach to wade through all the pathos of this decades spanning tale will be rewarded with a rich reading experience. For those who wimp out, you don't know what you are missing."
3,Disappointing,"This was my first Irving novel, selected because the synopsis of ""New Hampshire"" sounded so intriguing. What a disappointment. Irving's writing is brilliant; I really felt like I knew the characters and I could picture their mishaps in my mind as clearly as if I were there. But I kept waiting for the horrible world they all lived in to somehow get better - while all of the themes Irving explored created some humorous situations, it was all a bit too much. I eventually lost my enthusiasm for what happened to the characters and I found myself wishing the book would end much sooner than it did.I haven't given up on Irving, though. ""Owen Meany"" will be next."
1,Not funny,"I have read a few Irving books and enjoyed them, especially Garp and Ciderhouse Rules. This however, was horrible. I did not find it amusing in the least. Instead, it was extremely uncomfortable and redundant. I admire Irving for trying but in reality there in no way to make gang rape and incest funny."
2,Irving's treatment of suicide and death,"There are many reasons that I did not like this novel, but I was particularly disturbed by the seeming inevitability and even nobility of Lilly's suicide. For anyone who has ever contemplated suicide, the fact that Lilly was somehow destined to die is a disturbing thought. I don't think that people should blame themselves when family members commit suicide, but they don't have to accept it with such equanimity either. Perhaps if Lilly had had counselling (or some other kind of therapy), she could have learned to accept her cirumstances and gone on to lead a fulfilling life, even if that didn't include a successful writing career. I think it's worrisome that none of the other characters even contemplated this. My main gripe about this book is the characters' failure, in general, to appreciate and to truly mourn death; the death of not only Lilly, but also Egg, Mother and Freud."
2,Overly Redundant Themes and 2-Dimensional Characters,"Each character can be summed up in 5 words or less and Irving just keeps repeating things (Lilly's smallness, Freud being the ""other Freud"", Egg's constantly saying ""what?"", passing the open windows, Sorrow floats, etc., etc. I've read several other Irving novels and liked them, so that made this one especially disappointing.And maybe this is a 70's / 80's thing, but people having heart attacks just from the shock of seeing something? Really? Grandpa seeing stuffed Sorrow, cop seeing all lights go on in building).I had to see the movie, to see how this book was interpreted. Yikes, even worse. The word ""Zany"" comes to mind over and over. Not in a good way either.I'll try and remember the other novels instead (Owen Meany & Cider House Rules are probably my faves)."
4,An Atypical New England Family,"The story of an interesting, dysfunctional family filled with eccentric characters. I enjoyed it very much."
5,Amazing,"Once again, the reader is thrusted into the storm that is the story of the Berry family. A hapless dreamer for a father, a worried mother, a homosexual eldest son, the elder daughter was raped, the second oldest son (our 'hero') is in love with his older sister, the younger daughter who is perpetually small and the youngest, a boy named Egg.Take this family, throw a blind Jewish Austrian, two bears, three hotels, a bunch of prostitutes, a bunch of radicals, romance, and rape clinic. You've got yourself the Hotel New Hampshire!Now, if the characters and additions that make the plot have frightened you, please do not be alarmed. The Hotel New Hampshire is an amazingly easy and good read. If one liked the Cider House Rules (also by John Irving) one is BOUND to LOVE The Hotel New Hampshire.Just remember, keep passing open windows..."
5,sorrow floats,"Loved this book, but not as well-done as Owen Meany. Only Irving could have so many wonderful meanings of ""sorrow floats."" Highly recommend it, butnot for the easily offended."
5,John Irving's Best!,"In my opinion, this IS John Irving's best. Once you think you know John Irving's method and form, read A Widow for One Year."
2,Cold,"John Irving can be a very annoying writer, that's probably one of the reason's I've read 5 of his books so far, none which are as cold as this one. You see I like bizarre non-conformist stories, but The Hotel New Hampshire treats it charcters as cartoon characters. Rapes, deaths at sea and other tragedies are treated as trivial. I mean Mom and Egg die in a plane accident never to be heard from again in life or in the book. I am not suggesting Irving should have plunged into melodrama, there would be nothing worse than that,but the extreme aloofness of these characters made them at first unreal and then finally pathetic.For a more emotional and rewarding but less funny (yes this book is funny at the expense of its characters) read The Cider House Rules."
4,john irving,"i look forward to reading his novels. this is poignant , but not as much as Twisted River. characters are very interesting as always."
2,Not Irving's finest work,Irving's HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE may very well be his most disappointing novel. His keen sense of the absurd displayed in THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP and A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY is absent here. The characters are so bizarre that they border on self-parody. They are flatly drawn and one dimensional. The book felt like a novel version of one of T.S. Garp's second rate short stories.
3,Maybe sorrow floats because its pure,"Tragi-comic farce about the implausible adventures of an eccentric family of hotel owners. Irving creates some memorable scenes, and the book is at its edgy best when depicting the incestuous sexual tensions. But all of this is done much better in A Prayer for Owen Meany, so if you've already read Owen Meany you will only be disappointed in Hotel New Hampshire.The worst of this book are the heavy-handed literary references, and the over-the-top exotica and tragedy, which sometimes seems to be created for shock effect at the expense of the reader's willingness to see the fiction as real.While washing with Ivory soap I thought that maybe ""sorrow floats"" because its pure, and I was grateful that I could own that as my own observation because I kept expecting to turn the page and find it written, which would have caused me to throw the book across the room."
2,"Way below ""Garp"" and ""Owen Meany""","I was utterly enchanted by ""The World According to Garp"" and then put off by this laborious, unfunny tale. How could the same author have done this? No matter: fortunately, I later read ""A Prayer For Owen Meany"" and my faith in John Irving was restored. What an astoudning treasure of a novel!Anyway -- get any John Irving book EXCEPT this one."
5,Legos for Less,"Mega Bloks, like Legos, come in multiple sizes. I have the duplo size (Mini Mega). The ones being sold here appear to be the standard Lego size (Micro Mega). They are much less expensive than Legos, but are fully compatible with them for most purposes. The size of the blocks could be more clearly advertised, but the product itself is a good value. You can tell which are which by looking at the suggested age on the label."
4,nice but not great,"I bought this tub today for $10.00 at Meijer. My 2.5 year old son likes Legos. He was happy to get a large set of compatible ""bricks."" The quality is almost as good as Lego's but not quite. Also, on the down side, the largest brick is 2x4. On the plus side there are 2x4 plates and round 1x1 bricks. Oh, and the set is half the price of comparable Legos."
2,Note a great toy,"I bought these for my 5 year old. They didn't come with directions to make anything like LEGOS. I love the bigger Mega Blocks, he just became fustrated with these blocks. It seemed like they just put all of their left overs in this container. I prefer the larger mega blocks or Legos."
3,MICRO Mega bloks,"Hey all, read the product description closely. These are not the giant mega bloks in the duffle (my 2 year old loves those); these are the MICRO Mega Bloks. Goofy, huh? Micro Mega... they should get low points just for marketing something called micro mega but... I *do* recommend the mega Mega bloks. I have the good old wood blocks too, but sometimes the balancing and finesse they require discourage my little one. The mega megas are inexpensive (though there's some nut selling a 200 pc set on amazon for $69 right now. NO WAY!) and not perfect and you may want to upgrade to Legos when your little one is less ... less micro and more mega.=)"
1,megablocks too small,I thought the blocks would be larger as per a purchase of same brand about 2 years ago at K-B. I was highly dissappointed as these blocks were less than 1/2 the size and are not compatible with the older ones.
2,Mega blox,Half of these bloks were very small. They were not all mega bloks. I had to return them because I purchased them for a two year old.
4,It was good,The extra content supplied in the beginning of the book is helpful to poetry readers just starting out like me it was great to have something translate the complexity of the poems that I could understand
4,"Good, engaging read","A meaty novel that covers important issues, MERCY, MERCY ME is a fine read. In this story we are introduced to Dr. Dwayne Grandison, a successful therapist living in LA who gets presented with a tempting opportunity. Beverlyn Boudreaux, a popular evangelist/gospel singer proposes that Dwayne host her upcoming television show for her new Jubilee network.Dwayne isn't interested. Beverlyn persists, and soon Dr. Dwayne is a TV talk show success. Temptations, misjudgments, and other potentially damaging roadblocks face Dwayne who is forced to make some choices which bring his new lavish life to a crossroad.The book has some important lessons that won't be lost on the reader. It also is written in a humorous and at times romantic tone, and provides an interesting account of what can go on behind the scenes within the high profile African American singer/preacher industry.MERCY, MERCY ME is an enjoyable, engaging novel and is highly recommended."
4,"Once you get to page twenty, it's wonderful","It is wonderful to see men writing inspirational books like this. Mercy, Mercy me is an entertaining read about the lives of three ""Christians"", Dwayne, Nina and Beverlyn and what happens when their worlds collide. Dwayne Grandison, the main character, is trying to decide between following his heart or what others have told him is God's plan for his life. I didn't understand the first ten pages of the prologue (it was as if the author was trying to tell us everything up front even though it unfolds later.) I almost stopped reading the book there - but if that happens to you, hang in there. Once you get pass that, you'll enjoy every page. This is a read that entertains, inspires and teaches great life lessons."
3,alright,Too many typo's. I thought they were supposed to have people edit these books. It's just ridiculous.
2,12 Miles? Yeah Right!,"We bought these radios for three reasons: kids playing in the neighborhood, communicating while skiing, and short distance communication. Two out of the three reasons didn't work for us. We took them to Colorado and the performance wasn't at all what we had hoped. I was at the base of the mountain and my husband took his to the top. We lost reception probably half way up the lift. I also took one with me on a short trip in town just to check the 12 mile range. I was two miles down the road and lost reception - we live in a suburban area of Atlanta where this should not have been a problem. It does work great in the neighborhood when my son is just a stones throw away! Oh well, I guess we got suckered into the 12 mile pitch - hopefully you won't!"
5,More than I thought they'd be,"I've had these for a couple of years and have used them for car-car while traveling to having someone at a crkt while I've been at the crkt panel to verify pwr.We use for regular and ice fishing and scan others to find the hot spots.....more than you'd think.I don't know the real range, but I have never had any problem.They have weather, scan, voice activation, have clips, etc, etc.You can use them with rechargable or regular batts.They are littl bigger than some, but that's never been an issue."
5,Deceptively nice,"These are the only Motorola 2 watt radios on the gmrs market. Although they are larger than most radios, they are very lightweight and come with an excellent belt clip - not the cheap breakable clips that Motorola usually supplies. The reception is very good, the ability to choose high or low transmit power by pressing the p/t button is nice. No way you will get 12 miles out of any radio but Motorola usually has the best range of any brand so if you want a real 2 watt radio, with NOAA, this is the one."
2,motorola sx700r,"I bought these 2 way radios to use around the farm. Unfortunately they were useless about 1/2 mile away. I guess our terrain is too hilly. Maybe they will work in the woods, but not in the hills. I got free shipping from Amazon with this purchase, but when I returned them, they deducted the cost of the shipping from my refund, which I didn't have to pay in the first place. Read that in the fine print. It will make me reconsider buying things to try out."
4,I like these,"We bought these for use on camping trips with our grandchildren and for kayaking. At this time, I have only used them once on a camping trip. They worked very well. I did not measure distances, but they worked well for our purposes.The only problem I have with this product is that one of the holster broke as soon as I took it out of the box."
1,only 1 mile reception range,"I can not use it more than 1 mile, even on the high way, no blocking situation."
3,Range not as advertised,"This 2-way radio boasts a (up to) 12mile range, you will be lucky if you can get 1 mile under optimal conditions. Ignore range claims and go for the cheaper radio, the transmit power on all these radio's are identical."
5,Motorola SX700R Talkabout GMRS/FRS 2-Way Radios,"I am an Acreage Surveyor and distance between instrument and prism often require the use of radios for communication between engineers. These Motorola SX700R radios are the best I have ever used. My work environment is often extremely harsh, woods,mountains,etc. and the durability and dependability of these handhelds is second to none. Excellent product and a very wise purchase."
5,"Good Quality, decent range.",These radios sound great. The range is ok. I have another radio that claims to have 14 mile range and these will broadcast farther than the 14 mile radio. However the range is no where near the 12 miles they advertise. They are a little big but I think they might be less likely to be lost because of their size. Belt clip is good. There have plenty of features and options. I kind of wish they had the digital compass though. These are the best 2 way radios I've owner so far.
4,worth it,"I am a traditional rock climber and a backcountry snowboarder/mountaineer. These radios were a good choice at their $45 price. Between belays, reception is clear enough and ample. Above tree line, communication is expectedly easy, as well. Conversely, in the trees of the backcounty performance is notably lessened, yet still practical.Why Motorola doesn't add a lanyard, or at the very least, an attachment point for a carabiner or cord or whatever, so I can dangle the radio from my harness is waaaay beyond me. It was frustrating to realize the omission as I opened package. I solved this easily enough with (duh!) some duct-tape, but still...how hard could it be? The units are a lil' on the heavy side, but not so much as to warrant the super-cost of a super-light version.Overall, I am satisfied ... for now."
2,Talkabouts nothing to talkabout,"This product has many great features. HOWEVER, the claim of a 12 mileradius is a not just a joke, it is a downright lie. I have tried these in the forest, in the desert and in town. In all three incidencies I have achievedno greater distance than one (!!) mile. One mile!! It is blatant false advertising to claim that these radios can send a signal 12 miles.I have tried all 22 channels using only the ""strong signal"" button and still cannot achieve a distance greater than one mile.This is a great toy but nothing more."
5,Barney and Friends 2 Pack!,"The Barney & Friends 2 Pack is Great. 'Barney's Exercise Circus' and 'Barney's Parade Of Numbers'. 'Barney's Exercise Circus' is of cousre, you play circus while you exercise. It features Barney, Michael, Tina, Derek, Tosha, Min and a guest suprise, Luci. Starring Michael the Ringmaster giving the crowd the performers, snaking on healthy foods, and learn when you have a wiggle all around your body with Barney's guest, Joe Shruggs.

Tosha tells more about her suprise sibiling coming real real soon. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10! Yes Numbers Can Be Fun No Matter Where Or When."
4,"A Good Book of Interesting, Usable ESL Activities","This book will be quite useful for the class of beginning English speakers that I'll have this summer. The activities are on their level, and will capture their interest. The activities are not too long or too technical.This was a good buy."
2,All things change.....even this game.,"My brother had the original (I think) game when we were kids in the eighties. It was without doubt the greatest toy either of us owned growing up. Sadly, it gave out several years ago and left a bit of a void in my soul. So when I opened a gift from my brother last Christmas and saw the familiar shape of the game inside, I nearly wet my pants with joy. I started to play, then realized it wasn't quite the same. No passing? Can't go backward?? What is going on? Yeah, the spirit of the game is there, but it just isn't as good as the original. I could live with the battery change if all else was the same, but this is all wrong. Bring it back the way it was!"
3,I'll wait for Football 2,"I got hold of this new Football 1 and noticed that the little LED lights look different, instead of the ol' nice-n-bright blippy lights, it uses some new chintzy lookin' technology which takes from the magic of the toy. I figured I would buy a half dozen of a Football 2 re-release, but not without the beautiful glow of the late-great LED of old. I did notice a big improvement over the original, instead of needing that expensive and never-seem-to-have-on-hand 9volt battery, it requires 2 of the ubiquitous AA batteries."
5,Played this in college!,"My friend and I used to play this all the time in college. It had such a simple interface, but it allowed for great competition. I think we used to play for money; great memories."
4,Bring back memories,My brother had this game when he was a teenage he is now 37 years old. So when I saw this back on the market I had to get one for myself to bring back those memories. I showed this game to my brother and he laugh and ask me can he have the game. I laugh at him. Great game.
4,Just like the original,"This is the same toy that I played when I was a kid and it is still simple but captivating (although most of the captivating is likely nostalgia). I hope that they come out with version 2 where you could pass and run backwards, as well as the two man game where you could play head-to-head, one of you controllinga defensive player. Still, it is great that it is back!"
4,Simply Great,"What is it, 4 dots and a single-tone beep? And yet, this game remains as captivating today as it did when I used to play it on the bus on the way to 8th-grade a thousand years ago. Everybody should have one."
4,Good product,"I purchased this to put in my desk at work. It works great and appears durable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a bit expensive for what you get. I found an identical basket at Bed, Bath & Beyond in an ""off brand"" for half the price and it works just as well."
2,Not one of J Del Pozo's best,"I wanted to try something a little heavier, maybe even muskier, for winter. As a huge fan of Halloween by J Del Pozo I was reading good reviews on In Black and In White. In Black is supposed to be more winter appropriate than In White so I decided to take a risk. I have to be honest, I was a little disappointed by this fragrance. It's probably wonderful for someone else, but I just did not care for the scent. I know the price is on the lower end, but Halloween isn't exactly pricey and it smells amazing, so I figured this wouldn't be a let down. However, the perfume does smell cheap...and maybe a little too musky for me. Also, the nozzle under the cap breaks off easily, but the bottle itself is somewhat attractive. But I guess that's what I get for blind-purchasing a perfume."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"I received this set as a gift for Xmas. I stored it away for over 3 years because my Uniden phones were working fine.Loved that Uniden set, heartbroken when I started having problems with some of the handsets displays not working properly anymore. Oh well, I junk it and pull out this set from the closet. To my horror, NONE of the units can dial out. I kept getting the operator message ""You have dialed a number that is incomplete or cannot be dialed."" I have to use the speaker phone button on each handset to get the phone to dial out properly. Next the buttons on the phone are super sensitive, causing me to hang up accidentally on people from holding the phone the wrong way or too close to my face. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAArgh! This set is going in the recycling bin just as soon as my new Panasonic set arrives. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,good ingredients but not enough for the money,"I like it for the ingredients compared to other protein powders: no fat, low calories, low carb, and natural stevia.The taste is okay but not the best. It is definitely not bad.My complaint is the amount you get. I bought a tub of it and when I opened the lid was extremely disappointed to find that it was barely a quarter full. It did not last a week. I don't feel I got enough for the price, and the size of the packaging is rather deceitful."
2,No. There are better options than this book.,"If you had AP Lit course, the only useful thing is practice tests. But they nothing more than simply OK, nothing exceptional. I would not buy it."
5,suprizingly nice to look at,I have got a number of compliments already on these color changing LED lights.They add a touch of whimsy to the front yard.
5,Quality sheets/Great Price,"Very pretty, excellent quality, washes well, little or no ironing, oversized. All around great sheet."
2,Highly Over Rated,"This stuff is highly over rated.I looked at all the reviews before I bought this and am very disappointed. This work no better than CERAVE that I can buy at Walmart cheaper. If you want to spend big bucks on a bad product, go ahead and buy this."
4,"Great, but pricey",This lotion absorbs well into the skin with no greasy feel or look. It is smooth and feels good on the skin. It would be 5 stars if it was less expensive. I am currently searching for comparable product that is less expensive.
1,"Could be good, not for me though.","I was very excited about trying this product after reading many reviews. When I first put it on, it was light and not greasy. Approx 2 hours after putting it on I began to have a burning sensation on my face and turned red. My guess is my face does not agree with the Alpha and Beta Hydroxy's in the product. So I am less than satisfied with this expensive purchase that will go to waste in my drawer. Maybe I will give it to one of the ladies at work.So my final thoughts are that this product could have a place with many people but not with me. Make sure you check to see if this product will be compatible with your skin before you buy, especially since it is so expensive."
5,Great,"I agree some of the reviews look a little fishy, maybe employees.I am buying my second bottle at the moment. I have tried the spot acne, the face wash, and the moisturizer so far and have liked all three.They are very pricey, but seem to be top of the line quality.The question is are their products so much better to justify the price? I don't know the answer, I guess it depends on the person. Men's Health magazine reviews MenScience products highly everytime, if that counts for anything."
3,light,"I'm not sure how I would describe this product except for very light. It certainly leaves no oily residue and doesn't make your face shine. However, I often feel like I haven't put any moisturizer on my face at all. That is, I still feel like my skin is dry after using it. Not sure if I'd buy again."
4,Strong grassy taste,"The tablets are small and round, but I would prefer something in a capsule form. It has this grainy texture that seems to get caught in my throat. It also has a strong, grassy smell to it, but a lot of vitamins/supplements have a funny smell.I've been taking about 7 tablets on a daily basis. It definitely energizes you. I was originally taking the tablets at night, but I would have trouble sleeping. So, now I take them in the morning, and I feel energized.Wheatgrass is suppose to keep your body in an alkalized state. I neglect to eat veggies on a regular basis, so its a way of trying to do right by my body."
2,It's Ok,How would I ever know a vitamin is or isn't working short of performing extensive scientific testing. My basis thus is limited. I don't feel any differently taking these vs regular vitamins.My major problem is that the instructions are to take 21 tablets a day. Seriously? 21 pills a day? There is no way I am spending my time taking 21 pills of anything a day unless they are the only thing keeping me alive.So for practical purposes I wouldn't buy them again.
3,Animated Stories From the Bible,"This series is made by Nest Entertainment which I found out has Mormon ties. Because of this, you have to preview them carefully as they insert stuff that is inaccurate. Not in all of the series but some of them are really off base! I bought a bunch of them not knowing this and ended up throwing the ones that were erroneous in the trash!!"
5,"Soon, I'll be a first time grandmother","and I happened to find this book with it's intriguing title. I now feel that if and when something should ever happen to break apart my family unit that I will have a professional resource in this book. I can only imagine the heartbreak of a grandchild losing contact with loving grandparents. This book is educational, informative and a must read for every Grandparent. Highly recommended."
5,Valuable Info for all Grandparents!,"This is a one-of-a-kind book that offers a wealth of information concerning the legal rights of grandparents. I remember seeing the author on ""The Today Show"" discussing some of the issues detailed in this book."
1,DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE LEAST,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GUIDE TO HELP DETERMOINE THE VALUE OF YOUR COLLECTOR BICYCLES, FORGET IT!THIS BOOK HAS VERY LITTLE PRICING AND NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WHAT ONE WOULD CONSIDER A PRICING GUIDE.SAVE YOUR $$"
1,I am in total agreement with the first review,"I am in total agreement with the first reviewer, some nice photos but it is lacking in true prices and value."
4,Good reading,Interesting as always with many side stories. enjoy knowing some of the fictional facts of the past are with us today!
5,Air Battle Force - tour de force!,"I just love the pace and story-lines that Dale Brown manages to pack into his books and this one is no different, the technical detail, action and flying is up with the best. Thanks Dale - don't even think about retiring!"
2,Really the same plot,"Like many reviewers I have read all of Dale Brown's books. But these last few seem to be the same thing over and over. General Patrick McLanahan disregards orders and saves the day. I am just getting a little tired of the plot always involving The President and his administration threatening/demoting/giving McLanahan a cold cup of coffee or whatever.I also agree with a previous reviewer that there really isn't much suspense at the end, you know the high tech weapons will easily save the day. Its hard to connect psychology with high tech weapons, the humans seem to play second fiddle. Finally I have a really hard time with a Taliban hero."
1,this book stinks,"I've read every Dale Brown book published. This is not the same old Dale Brown we are used to. Hope it gets better from here, or I am done."
5,Air Battle Force,Story line was exciting and detailed as is normal with Dale Brown novels. The main character is this series book is Patrick McLanahan who who is dedicated to protecting the United States from all enemies. The detailed description of the high tech equipment and the story plots keep the readers attention. Books purchased for the Kindle reader are superb and very quickly down load to the reader....Another great book in the series.
2,A reminder of why I don't read more Dale Brown.,"For me, Dale Brown's first books were exciting and fun to read. Lately his books seem to be 1/3 action and 2/3 mundane, useless conversation between his characters. I find myself scanning page after page until I find an area that holds my attention and don't feel I've missed anything! I love the action and technical aspects of his books but for me, the mundane conversations in between are just not worth it."
4,Air battle force,"Dale Brown did a great job with this book,can't wait to read the rest of the books. For those of us that were in the arm services will enjoy the books."
3,Mildly disappointing,"Having read and enjoy previous Brown books, I was disappointed to find this installment to be slower going than previous reads."
2,quality doesn't compare to Playmobil,"These toys are so great in theory. The level of detail seems so fantastic...from the faces to the accessories. BUT, the quality is terrible. My 3 year old has toys from both Mighty World and Playmobil and they can't even compete when it comes to durability and function. The hats don't stay on the figures' heads, pieces break off regularly, and the items just don't have the same range of motion that the Playmobil items do. I don't recommend these toys."
1,Not what I expected,"This umbrella is cheap, tall and ungly. Its made of hollow brown plastic that I think is supposed to look like wood with gold-colored metal at the center joint. It is way too tall for my standard sized patio table and the color of the umbrella part is ivory rather than natural. Overall, very dissatisfied and I would try to return but it is not an easy thing to send back."
2,Cheap,"Luckily I only wanted an inexpensive Market Umbrella to keep me dry while grilling in the rain, and that's exactly what I got; CHEAP. The Polyester umbrella is very thin and the pole is really cheap looking and in my case, had a slight bend near the bottom. Here again, I was lucky because the pole was too tall so I had to saw part of it off and that pretty much eliminated the bent portion. I really didn't expect it to be this cheap though, but the bottom line is: ""you get what you pay for""."
5,Patio umbrella,"I had searched all the usual stores that sell this product and found the prices higher than I was willing to pay. On a chance, logged on to Amazon, found exactly what I was looking for and for about $40 less, with free shipping! Was advised product would not arrive for up to 8 days; it arrived within three, and in near-mint condition. Quite satisfied."
1,Market Umbrella,Came broken with a bent bottom leg. Contacted company (at Amazon's insistance) twice with no response at all from Company. I would not buy another thing from BOND located in the San Francisco Bay area!!!
2,You get what you pay for,"You really can't expect much from a $45 umbrella, when the higher quality umbrellas are selling for $100-$200. Mine arrived with one broken rib (out of eight), so I have one droopy point -- I guess I can live with that. Can't wait to see what happens when we have high winds; if I were wise, I would take it down at the first sign of a strong wind. I gave it two stars only because of the price."
1,Not high quality,"Within one hour of using the first time two wood arms cracked when the umbrella was hit with a gentle breeze. We were having a party at the time and were using 8 other umbrellas and they were not affected by the breeze. I don't know what wood they used to make these, but apparently it is not very strong. If only one arm had broken I would have thought it just had a weak spot. But when two broke, I can only think one thing....this umbrella is junk. Perhaps they were cracked in transit and I didn't realize it until using the umbrella, but I would still have to wonder about the quality of the wood."
4,Good umbrella for the buck,"My wife and mother-in-law purchased this for our new patio furniture. It looks great and seems sturdy enough. We've had it for about a month, so haven't put it though any yearly tests, but I'm happy with the purchase. You can tell its probably not American made. The wood could be better quality, but for under $50 its not a bad deal really. The umbrella itself is very big, which is nice and the material its made out of seems very thick, and not cheap."
5,Loved It!!!,"This book was funny,this book was scary. I foundthis book to be very believable. The characters were written sowonderfully, I could actually see them come alive on the pages.It starts when a Vietnamese-American writer finds a gift at his front door. He accepts the gift, not knowing what is to follow. Soon he meets Deliverance, and the joyride begins.I truly enjoyed this book, and recommend it toeveryone. I give this book my highest rating of 5 stars:) By the way, I need a cheeseburger!!!"
3,Ticktock? Story of two books,"Sure, I read this book in about 12 hours. It is very short and very easy to read. The first one quarter of the book actually had me ready to pee my pants, but then the book took a different direction, and seemed stupid. Sure, I enjoyed the book, but I totally expected it to be different. I liked the mood in the begenning. Very scary and suspenseful. Then all this weird stuff later in the book about aliens, and that magical dog. That is too silly"
2,"It's been done before, and better","Friends had told me about Dean Koontz. Unfortunately, this is the first one of his books I've read. I wish I'd read his afterword before I started. The best part of the book is the narrator's relationship with his mother, although it is shopworn, too. Really now, this has all been done before, and a whole lot better. It seemed he didn't have a good idea, but needed to write, so he was doing something more interesting for the other hours of his day. Reader's Digest would have been a better reading choice"
3,"Nice try, but no banana.","I've been reading lots of Dean Koontz books lately, right after getting so high on Intensity.Most of them, proved to be disappointing compared to that very scary aforementioned book.Ticktock is one of the best, I'm afraid. That doesn't mean it's good, though. It's certainly entertaining, but the journey's only worth the ride because of Del. She rocks. Tommy's nice, but it seems to me that Dean's dressed an old cliche with some new clothing, though.I'm only giving it a six because I've enjoyed Del, Tommys mother, and that other vietnamese lady, and some of the dialogue, which was quirky."
2,Dean misses the mark!,"I am an avid reader of Dean Koontz's work, and this has got to be the most boring, confusing and strange work to date. I couldn't stand Del. What a braggart! She was so ridiculous, I can also believe that she would have to have been an alien! No human being could possibly be a great marksmen, a hot-shot race car driver, psychic, and everything else she was purported to be. Give me a break! And Tuong ""Tommy"" Phan is a disgrace to the Vietnamese race! What a wimp! I think the idea of a ""voodoo"" doll with strange powers could have made for a good read, but let's face it folks, this just wasn't it. I was very disappointed, and sorry I wasted my time. I don't think my library would want it as a donation"
1,Horrible,"I can only hope that the once talented author of such books as ""Watchers"" and ""Twilight Eyes"", was satisfying a contract by writing this ""novel."" I can think of no other excuses why he would write something so terrible, and place his name on it willfully.The ending is not only bad, but so contrived as to be insulting. While having strong female leads is important in a modern novel, Mr. Koontz seems hell bent on putting radical feminists in each of his books. Witness the characters in his latest novels (Dark Rivers of the Heart, Intensity, now Tick Tock). Perhaps the wife has gotten to his brain....Please Dean, please! Start writing scary stories again!! You have proved how sensitive you are, how about proving you can still scare us?"
2,Ummm...okay?,"This is one of the dumbest books I have ever read. I love black comedies, but this black comedy was missing one thing: the comedy. I didn't find it at all funny until the very end, and the characters were 100% unconvincing. Only read it if you are drunk."
4,unusual ending,Tick Tock was very exciting. I stayed up until midnight reading it. The reason I didn't give it full credit is because the ending needed a little help.
4,Really great and fun read.,"This is about the third book I read by Koontz, the other having been read about 8 years ago, but I thought this one was great. It's a shorter novel and fast paced. It basically tells about one night where a man and a women- who seems a bit loose some screws- are on the run from a demon who has been summoned to kill the male character. The author takes a lighter tone with this novel and makes you laugh at times over the dialogue between the lead character and those he knows. The only thing I felt could have been better was the ending. It wasn't as climatic as I would have like, but still definitly good. Definitly read this book if you like horror suspense with some laughter along."
5,Dean Koontz At His Absolute Terrifying Greatest,"There is only one author that I can think of that freezes your blood and makes you feel as though your heart as actually stopped. His name is Dean Koontz, and with ""Ticktock"", these feelings are quite real. I first read this book when I was about 14. At that age I was obsessed with ordering books from Double Day, and as I penned in the number for Dean Koontz's ""Ticktock"", I never knew I would be taken on a ride on a rain-heavy, lightning-sticken night. This is THE best Dean Koontz. If you want to know the two best Dean Koontz books...They are ""Ticktock"" and ""The Door to December""."
5,Great audio book,"I've never read a Dean Koontz book, so I didn't have any particular expectations for this story. It was a wonderful surprise. B. D. Wong does a terrific job of bringing all the eccentric characters to life. The story reminded me of another favorite book of mine, ""Cold Dog Soup."" I had to keep reminding myself that one person was reading all the dialog, the characterizations were so vivid."
1,Worth a Listen? - Nope,Some Koontz novels are entertaining thrill rides but others are no better than lame pitches for silly horror films that should never be produced. Ticktock is one of the later. I listened to the BD Wong audio tape version which creates some interest from vocalizations of the Vietnamese-American characters but his portrayal of the ditzy/deep blond heroine Del Payne was just plain irritating. A skilled actress for that voice might have made this tape (but not the novel) a marginally acceptable diversion. Cannot recommend.
1,simply silly,"I have read many by Koontz and I definetely say this is the worst! I really liked Watchers and Twilight Eyes, but there is something about Koontz that disturbes me. He doesn't seem to have any imagination. In three of his books I have read, the mystery of the story was related to some genetic work that has gone out of control, I don't know if there are any others. He tried to plot something different in this one but unfortunately it turns out to be something rather childish, or , to be honest, silly. I say, do not waste your time."
1,A most annoying little book,"I am a fan of Dean Koontz, and have been forgiving of his work when it didn't live up to Watchers. But in the case of Ticktock, there is just no excuse. Now I should be positive, but what positive things can I say about a book whose only likable character is a dog? Or that the best thing about the ending is that it is finally over? Now that said, Koontz has said this was his first and only attempt at a screwball comedy. Problem 1: it's not funny. Problem 2: it's two serious to not be taken seriously (unless you count the ending, in which credability, sense and style jump in front of a speeding truck in a desperate attempt to outrun the author.) The hero is a idiotic jerk, his love interest is suppose to be kooky, but is just stupid and annoying (not to mention trigger happy,) and the unstoppable monster is pathetic, as is the resolvement of the piece. Koontz should have known better, and should give up any asperations of becoming a comedian."
1,Very bad.,"I am a big fan of Dean Koontz, but this one just didn't seem as good as some of his past others. I really wouldn't recommend it, but that's just my opinon."
2,Tick Tock,"I am generally a King fan, but I was in the bookstore one day and picked up ""Tick Tock"". I bought it because I thought the storyline sounded very interesting. The start of the book was very enjoyable and suspenseful. As the book progressed I was getting tired with the way Koontz portrayed Del's mysteriousness and the way Del talked to Tommy. I found some of that unrealistic. And then at the end of the book I was disappointed. The way Koontz decided to explain the origin of the doll was a pitiful one, simply seeing as there was potential for a much greater ending. And the origin of the doll just wouldn't happen in my mind from a nice person whose intents were innocent. And my final criticism is the origin of Del and her dog. If this was meant to be a horror book, leave it at that. Don't attempt to mash in fantasy and science fiction at the very end to tie off loose ends. But otherwise the book was somewhat fun and some parts were suspenseful--though only two by my count."
4,Not What I Expected,"This book is completely different to all of the other Dean Koontz books that i have read. The story is about a character called Tommy Phan who comes home one day and finds a rag doll on his doorstep. The doll is ordinary looking other than the fact that it has two crosses where the eyes should be, a cross where the mouth should be and a cross where the heart should be. The story goes a bit wierd from there on but i loved it. Dean Koontz has come up with another winner even if it is different to his normal style of writing."
2,Silly and Childish. Should be a Teenager book,"Dean R. Koontz likes to mix horror with sitcom style characters. He has written so many books in this category that I think he is running out of ideas. He also has a formula, which although he has been trying to change in the last 6 or 7 years, is still basically the same in each book. For example you know that the main characters will discover each to be the soulmate of the other.In this book his style is wearing thin and reads more like a R. L. Stine book for teenagers. His characters are also to cutesy, their lines are from a 60's sitcom, and I am tired of his using his super smart dog (usually a labrador) character which he feels he needs to put in more and more of his books. I try to keep myself from buying any more of his work yet, because I used to be a big fan, sometimes I am desperate for quick read and he is the only thing I can find at the airport."
3,"Entertaining, better than most for kids as well","Entertaining, but without much of a surprise ending. I was pleased to read a book that I could recommend to my kids due to the absence of inappropriate languange and story line."
2,Just silly,"This is not a typical Dean Koontz, as he himself explains at the end of the book. He says he wanted to write a ""screwball comedy."" Well, this ain't Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn. I felt cheated. I spent the time reading the book trying to logically figure out the mystery, only to find there was no logic."
3,Well...it's a page turner,"I read my first Koontz book years ago, and it was horrible. It was about a football team that was being turned into mutants or something. Then I happened to read this, and it it was really enjoyable. It's not life changing or anything, but in the beginning it's very creepy. However, as the book progresses it get funnier and funnier. The strange mix of comedy and horror in Tick Tock made me want to read more Koontz. The Chrostpher Snow books are better though.Anyway, a very fast, amusing read- I stayed up all night to read it, Definitely not a waste of time!"
5,The easiest read I have ever experienced!,"Finally an author like Koontz shows he posesses a sense of humor. Tick Toc, although tounge in cheek,simply grabs the reader and takes them on a wild,sometimes campy,ride that you will not want to stop until you reach the end of the line. Others may judge Koontz for writing this book, but I for one am glad he did. It really shows that another side of his talent and brilliance. This is definatly one that you must experience to appreciate."
2,Horror and comedy lite,"The more I read this story, the more I realized the author didn't take this very seriously. That's fine as it's supposed to be a light read. Good action scenes early on but the comedy was lame and the characters were one dimensional. Can't this author write about someone beyond wealthy Californians (who never seem to have jobs) and their 100 IQ dogs?"
4,"Fast, Furious, and Funny . . .","This might not be ""Koontz at his best"" but it is still a great read. Koontz is awesome at building characters you can believe in and relate to. Koontz also does an excellent job at blending horror with humor without making it seem ridiculous: a feat many authors fall short of."
3,Weird,"I just recently started reading Dean Koontz, and I have mixed feelings. The most recent book I picked up was ""Tick Tock."" It was a fun read, but like some of his other books, I felt like he couldn't really decide where he was going with it. He wasn't sure if it was a comedy, or a sci-fi novel, or a love story... The effect was a little unsettling. I also felt like he wasn't sure how to end it, so he just slapped together a quick conclusion so he could move on to something else. The characters are a hoot, though -- especially Mrs. Phan and Del. Overall, just so-so."
4,Interesting life,If you are looking for an interesting book that keeps you aware about what is going on in thir life I can recommend you this book because it is really exciting. Also if your intristed in cars and action I recommend you this book. Its a good book because it is really easy to understand.
3,It's a toss up,"It's a toss up, this isn't my fav. Koontz book. I just found the plot of a tiny rag doll harassing this man, a little out there. However, I tried to put that out of my mind...My favorite part was the last 100 pages, I liked the ending. If you're looking to read something by Koontz, I wouldn't recommend this book first. If you're a loyal fan like me, read it, it's a part of his library. But if you are looking to just try him, I'd recommend you read something like Intensity or Fear Nothing first. They are much better books."
2,The First I haven't been able to finish,"I started reading Tick Tock a few months ago. I still haven't finished it yet. In fact I haven't picked it up for over a month.The plot is seems like a rewrite of the 70's movie ""Trilogy Of Terror."" A little doll goes nuts with a knife.Koontz books usually grab my attention by page 2 or 3. Tick Tock hasn't done that yet. Right now my copy sits in the bathroom next to Reader's Digest. So if I'm particularlly constipated I may find the time to pick it up again."
3,How Bizarre!!!,"This is my 1st Koontz book. After Chapter 6, the book became so bizarre, I didn't know if I wanted to continue reading it. I finished it, but was very disappointed with the conclusion. I'm not into science fiction, but if you are, this ending might just satisfy your craving"
2,Definately not one of his better books,"I really like Dean Koontz's work but this one was definately a big disappointment. In the beginning it seemed as though it had potential. However it kept going no where and the ending was the worst of all. His adding the supernatural and ufo abuctions came out of no where and made absoutely no sense at all. I had just finished reading Intensity which was absoutely great and then I read Tick Tock which was terrible. I really don't know what he was thinking. I hope he doesn't try going down that road again. Overall though his books are really good reading, but I guess everyone deserves one mistake"
1,Skip this one,I first read Cold Fire and enjoyed it a great deal. I couldn't believe Tick Tock was written by the same author. After a few more Koontz books I realized this was his weakest book with the most ridiculous plot.
1,"Boring, Oh So Boring","Well this is just flat out a boring book.It starts out competently (note: not great but not bad) but quickly turns into a pitch for a rather bad action movie, a boring predictable chase followed by some bad dialogue followed by another boring chase and repeat. Pluck a few of the usual suspects out of the sterotypes bin for characters and you've got yourself an awful literary work.The best bit, and only funny part, is the authors afterword at the end; he claims its a 'screwball comedy' ie its deliberately crappily written. Like Kevin Cosnter telling us Waterworld was supposed to be a horrnedus flop - it was his post-postmodern commendary on the world or some such rubbish.Obviously upon reading the draft he realised how bad it was and tried to passs it off as being deliberately bad cos it a 'comedy'. Its bad alright, but boringly so, not funny bad."
2,NOT a Real Dean Koontz Work,"I keep looking for the Dean Koontz of old, whoadded ""Strangers"" and ""Watchers"" to my bookshelfforever. This wasn't it. If I was looking foran off-beat dark comedy, this WOULD have been it."
4,Pleasant surprise!!,"It didnt take long for me to realize that this book was not the ""typical"" for Koonz, but it was a welcome and much enjoyed surprise! I would recommemd it to any one who enjoys humor mingled into the suspense"
3,Was this supposed to be funny?,"Koonz is by far one of my favorite authors, but this book didn't perform up to par. Tommy Phan, a Vietamese-American, doesn't want to follow in his parent's footsteps. Instead he leaves the family business to pursue a carrer as an author. Just as life seems great, a ""rag doll"" is conjured, which seeks to kill Phan. Can Phan out run this thing? The characters were fun, but the ending wasn't as thrilling as I hoped it would be. It was an OK story, it just didn't have that tangy zip like other Koont's novels"
3,Horror and Humor Should Not Mix,My first Koontz novel. It was not a bad experience although his writing style takes some getting use to reading. The book has some good horrifying moments and chills went down my spine at times. However the author would insert some humor blurb which would break the spell. An occasional giggle here and there is okay but it appeared the author got carried away with his own sense of humor. This is okay but the humor comes more in the center of the book and carries to the end. Sort of a let down after scaring you in the first part of the book. Too much like a 'B' horror film
4,"Excellent story, fast paced with lots of action and humor","I really loved this book. I read it years ago, but saw it in a library last week and picked it up. I read it in 5 days! Of course, I'm a Koontz fan anyway. Tick Tock features a young Asian American writer who finds a strange doll on his doorstep. Unfortunately for him the doll comes to life and tries to kill him! While the pacing and action were very good, what I really liked was the humor in this story. I definitely recommend it!Ryan Hoover, Author of ""Immortal Implements"""
4,WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE!,"I just finished this novel, and thought Koontz did a great job of using a Vietnamese-American protagonist as the lead for a change. In this novel Tommy Phan is being chased by a small Voodoo type rag doll. Along the way he meets a quirky girl Del and together they must rely on thier skills and whit to out manuever this evil doll. The chase is on and we deal with car chases, boat chases and explosions. I thought that Koontz added a nice amount of comic situations...especially at the fateful ending. This is a departure for the normal Koontz novel and I welcome it. Alot of fun for the beach or where ever."
4,Wow!,"Dean is no slouch in the writing department! All of his works are must-reads, and ""Tick Tock"" is no exception. This book combines suspense with a not-too-common element that many books need: humor. If anyone knows how to thrill, and chill, it's Dean! The reader is catapulted in a bizarre story that explores not only a different kind of terror, but well researched ideas, thoughts, and theories. Dean is always persuing the question ""What If?"" ""What if a strange looking rag doll was foundon my porch? What if it grew, and became a monster? What if it was part of a curse, and someone of my neglected culture could help? What if?..."" If you don't want to be thrillled, look somewhere else, because that's exactly what this book is!"
3,Mildly entertaining but...,"not Koontz at his best. The novel suffers from too much dialogue, much of it not necessary to the plot. It somewhat redeems itself in the mystery surrounding Tommy's female saviour. If you like a novel with the elements of science-fiction like monsters, you'd probably enjoy this one. But if you prefer a suspenseful, horror novel that could be plausible in a real-life situation, you should probably pass on this one."
4,Tick Tock by Dean Kootz,"Tick Tock by Dean Kootz is a suspenceful book. Tick Tock was about a novelist, Tommy Phan, who comes home to a doll on his doorstep. But not any doll, a strange looking doll covered in all white with black stiches all over it. Being curios, Tommy Phan brings the doll in the house but that night he hears things and as he looks to see what it is the stiches are popping off of the heart of the doll. Then something comes out and he doesn't know what it is. Soon after that he finds a message from the doll on the computer... I think that this book is a good book for people that like to be scared and suspenced."
5,"Part Thriller, Part Screwball Comedy...","and and all-around fun read! Although most Dean Koontz novels have their share of humor, this novel is a bit more off-the-wall than most. Of course, it has its fair share of terror, as the hero, Tommy Phan, is being chased by a monstrous demon summoned by an unknown antagonist. However, when Tommy meets Deliverance Payne and her dog, Scootie, the fun begins in earnest.The novel starts of a little bit slow, but picks up very quickly. When the action started, I couldn't put it down! This book demands to be read at one sitting, if at all possible. I read it after the completion of a very stressful semester, and it was an excellent way to get rid of excess tension."
2,Not his best,"This book lacked any real character development through much of the first half. Only until the end did the characters start to get interesting, but it was too late to save this book."
4,YA GOTTA LOVE THIS ONE!,"This was the second DK book I ever read and I totally loved it! Tommy's got some serious but wacky family problems and he's also got a cool car...at least for a little while. Del's one of DK's best characters just 'cause of what she is (read the book and find out what I mean). And I love the dog! Ok, let's give the minkin some credit too, even though it did ruin a perfectly good love scene. My only problem w/this book is that it's way too short."
2,Not the best Koontz,"I'm a huge Koontz fan, but this is among his weaker efforts. As always, his writing is great and his characters are a lot of fun. But the story in this was a bit weak to me. It's basically a horror/sci-fi comedy, and Koontz is almost as good at comedy as he is with thrillers, but something about this story fell flat. I don't want to give away plot points so I won't get into great detail. Let's just say that if you're not familiar with Koontz, don't start off with this. Go with ""The Face"" or ""Intensity."""
3,A Little Disappointing....,"As many have stated, I agree that the book starts out very strong. Sadly, it falls flat. Without giving anything away, I must say that this ""lady friend"" wearing the Santa Claus hat and working as a waitress really annoyed me. Later on, we find out what her REAL ""purpose"" is in this story? Give me a break! Not to mention, there was a certain ""puzzle"" that wasn't solved. Again...I can't give it away, but the mystery surrounding the voodoo doll was rather cheesy along with WHY the note that came with it was written in Vietnamese language. It was like several stories all bunched up together and the author tried to give each ""story"" the same ending. It will hold your interest (it did mine) but it's nothing you would recommend to a friend."
4,Thrill Ride!!!,"Tick Tock is a fantastic thrill ride from author Dean Koontz. After protagonist, Tommy Phan, comes home to find a package on his doorstep, Tommy finds himself thrust into a race for his life. The contents of the package, a simple stuffed doll with black stitched eyes, becomes Tommy's nemesis as he frantically tries to stay alive. With a life ending deadline of dawn, Tommy does everything he can to stay alive.Koontz really delivers with Tick Tock. I enjoyed the pace of the book, something I appreciate very much. Nothing is more boring than a book that drags on with page after page of useless information. Tick Tock does just the opposite. The reader will be sucked into Tommy's plight, though they may not like him very much in the beginning, you will be cheering for him by the end.Good Luck Tommy."
3,"Not his best, but still enjoyable...","This book started pretty slow for me. I even contemplated not finishing it, as I felt the first couple chapters were rather silly. Then, I was introduced to an intriguing character by the name of Deliverance Payne. I think Del's character really made this book what it is, which actually turned out to be a pretty good book. There are a few holes in the plot; however, most of them are only realized at the end of the book, and are not disstracting. I would be tempted to give this book a better rating if it were not for those flaws, as the rest of the book is fairly solid."
4,"Strange, but I got a good laugh","This was not your typical Koontz novel, but I enjoyed reading it. The only complaint I have is the villian. Tommy's mom's friend. A person who did not come into the story until the very end of the book. Since someone left the doll at his door, then we have a who-done-it, and when it is a character that doesn't have any part in the book until they are revealed as the villian, is annoying. Yet, getting to that part was fun. Not a hardback book, so worth the price to read."
3,Not his best book,"When I read the first few pages I couldn't believe my eyes! A little doll gone mad????? Are you kidding me???? Certainly not a typical D.K. book!! The humor was refreshing, though. For me it was no ""thriller"":he couldn't keep my attention for long This definitly is not his best book..."
5,It was entertaining,"I really enjoyed Tick Tock...yeah, it was different and it isn't classic Dean Koontz but it was completely entertaining. If you are looking for a fun but enjoyable book check this out...and any real Koontz fan should like it just because it showcases his ability to write in many different styles"
5,A really fun read!,"I have been a big Koontz fan for quite a while and have always appreciated that he makes his novels fun to read by including humor to lighten the suspense. Tick Tock takes the humor and runs with it. I laughed out loud, and enjoyed it so much I read it again AND listened to it on tape. Definitly not the same as Koontz's other works, but it wasn't suposed to be. Tick Tock probably should not be the first Koontz novel you read (because it is so different from all his other works) but true fans will enjoy!"
2,Utterly Embarrassing....,"After reading this book, I was ashamed that I had announced to so many people what a Koontz fan I was, fearing that out of all Koontz's novels this would be the one they picked out to read.The book is terrible. But, I agree with the reviewer who said it seemed as if it should be for young teenagers, and compared it to R.L. Stine. That's just what I was thinking. Perhaps if I was 13 I would have liked the book, with all it's childishness.So that is why I gave it two stars instead of one - it was amusing in some parts, and the characters were very colorful. I just don't think adults would want to pay for this book, or if they do then they should know what to expect."
2,Disappointing and not very Koontz like,"This attempt was more like a Creepshow or Tales From the Crypt episode and not a deep and involved Dean Koontz book. It might entertain 13 year olds, but it is much too light and fluffy with some cheesy humor in it. I love Koontz and still read all of his work, but I will not read this one a second time."
2,This was written by Dean Koontz?,"The only reason this book sold was because of who wrote it. I own several novels of Dean Koontz. Fortunately I borrowed this one from a friend. I was very disappointed. However, it was not boring. This book was just not what I expected based on other novels by Mr. Koontz. I definately would not recommend this book to any of my friends. Dean Koontz has so many other books that are better."
2,"Oh, Dean....","i never thought i'd write a bad review of a dean koontz book, but this one really disappointed me. i can hardly put my finger on what i didn't like...maybe it's because it was too short to develop the characters. or maybe that the story was just silly. anyway, i like every other book i've ever read by him, so i guess not liking only one is a pretty good average!"
2,Tick Tock How Time Dragged On,"I haven't disliked a book so much in recent memory. The premise was very intriguing - a small doll comes to life and terrorizes a man for no apparent reason. As I read and read I got swept away in a sea of bad jokes and dialogue, as well as absurd characters and unbelieveable events. A 20 foot truck outruns a Jaguar? I don't think so. Aliens, psychics, and magic dogs? Really? In his afterword, Koontz says he wanted to right something light and comical. This was neither. The beginning was painfully slow, the suspense throughout was pretty good but the ending was disappointment on top of disappointment. Dialogue was weak and annoying most times. Very disappointed in this story."
2,SUSPENSE FILLED COMEDY SUCKED,Let me say this. This is my first dean koontz book I've read and let me tell you I'm not impressed. The starting hundred pages are fast pace relentless suspense. But after that it becomes this comedy thriller witch I did not like. The carachters were well drawn and there was some good suspense but the ending SUCKED.I felt like he took the easy way out and just made up any old ending. That was the huge flaw of the book. It was like he coud'nt find a sutiable ending so he just gave a bad one. The only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 was del. The mysterious heat packing woman that can kick any demons ass blindfolded. The mystery to her was the best put when I found out why she's so wierd its disapointing. She was the best part of the book.Mr koontz im about to start intesity and I hope that its better then this juckass story
2,Cheesy and Unrealistic,This book was not the average Koontz book in my eyes. This book was more like a failed experiment by DK to be different
3,I expected more...,This is only my third Koontz novel and I was expecting more. I read Intensity and Strangers before and from the high note that I left with in Strangers this was definitely a let down. Although it did have its moments that grabbed me the ending was a let down and pretty uneventful.
4,"Engrossing thriller, but only for fans of this type book","Listened to the taped version of TICK TOCK by Dean Koonthz, a comic thriller about a 30-year old novelist who stumbles onto a mysterious doll . . . his misfortunes then begin . . . along the way he discovers a wacky helpmate and a really strange dog . . . I've only read one other book by Koontz and must admit that because of what he typically writes about (the supernatural), I'm not a big fan . . . yet this effort was engrossing, in large part because of the excellentcharacterizations . . . in particular, I laughed whenever thenovelist's mother appeared in the story--a tribute toB.D. Wong's fine job of narration . . . to be able tocombine humor with this subject matter requires a talentedwriter and Koontz is certainly that . . . but unless you're adiehard fan, I wouldn't even recommend you rush out toget this effort."
1,If there were only a 0 star choice,"This novel is one of the worst pieces of tripe I have ever been subjected to. The plot elements are random and unconnected, the ending is ridiculous, and the overall reading experience was more embarassing than enjoyable. The plot is childlike in construction, without a hint of the sophistication indicated by the cover notes.I wouldn't have been able to finish it at all, had it not been for the fact that I'd bought the audio book (to survive a long drive) and I could find little else to do.I am regretful that this is the first Koontz book I've read, because it's not likely I'll ever pick up another after this experience."
5,A Look Inside the Mind of a Schizophrenic,"""Is There No Place on Earth For Me"" is a telling tale of the life of a Schizophrenic. Sheehan goes inside the mind of the character to explore the inner workings and provide detailed accounts of what life is like for someone suffering with Schizophrenia and the hell their life can become. Sheehan at one point, even slept in the bed next to her character in the mental institution. This act assures not only a detailed account, but also an accurate one. Sheehan reinforces the old saying...Don't knock Charlie till you walked a mile in his shoes! This book takes you through many miles in a Schizophrenics shoes. It extricates vivid details of the inner mind and its workings. This is a book you will never forget. After reading this story, you will never look at mental illness in the same light again."
5,"An amazing, life-changing book","I've just re-read this book ... I had first read it when it was published in a series of articles in The New Yorker about thirty years ago ... and it is just as compelling and haunting to me. Through the brilliance of its author, Susan Sheehan, Sylvia Frumkin is brought to life in all her agonized glory. You will never forget her."
2,You get what you pay for,"I guess you get what you pay for, the entire book feel apart, the pages slipped right out of the middle and I havent finished reading the pile of papers Ive been left with. The content of the book, so far, was great!"
5,Interesting and eye opening,"I found many interesting things in the book, but what jumped out at me most was to see that some of Sylvia's doctors and her parents couldn't separate out the person from the illness. Sylvia's violent, disrespectful behavior wasn't the illness, but I think the illness made it more difficult for her to control herself; many times it appeared she could control certain things if she WANTED to - she appears driven not just by the illness, but by her emotions, as well.Having had a child with issues, I had to understand the ""issues"", but still discipline him and provide necessary boundaries so he knew how far he could go with me and the rest of humanity despite his challenges. I think it's helped him to grow into a person who can actually live in the world with all of it's rules and standards. If I hadn't disciplined him and had merely medicated him and with sentimentality let him away with everything, he'd be locked up today, somewhere."
3,"True, intimate, and slow","I think this book shows the reality of liveing with schizophrenia and the feeling that there is no place for you. This book takes you through relaspe and healing periods with the main women character. It also shows the failures in our system. I think the book gets a little slow at points, it is a book you can definately put down, but it does do justice to teaching and learning about life with schizophrenia."
3,It doesn't fit!!!!,Make sure that you measure your doors before you buy one of these. We bought our and we were excited. Then we couldn't get it in and out of the bedroom without collapsing the entire system just to get it through the doors. It seems to be a good product but make sure you measure first. It's a real pain when it doesn't fit.
3,Magnificent Pipe Organ,"This is a nice recording on a beautiful organ, but the all Widor recording on the same organ, ""Soar Above"", rates five stars and is among the best pipe organ recodings available. The artist on ""Soar Above"" is Frederick Hohman, but the organ is the same magnificent Casavant-Schantz instrument. Both discs are on the ProOrgano label."
4,GREAT... But OverPriced on Amazon,"Very helpful informative book and very similar to Lovenheim's other books on this subject. That being said, the people selling it here on Amazon are doing you a grave injustice by pricing the book (beginning at) $60.00. HELLO! Turn the book over and you will see that the price is $30! Why pay double for a used (or even new) book when you can order it from Barnes and Noble for less. Don't waste your money here! But definitely search out this book!"
5,A few excellent tracks and some lame ones,"This album is not consistently Tito Puente's best. It was recorded during 1955-57 evidently in an attempt to homogenize and pasteurize Latin music so that it would appeal to the American public of that time. The result is that most of the tracks are orchestrated with insipid strings or otherwise made intolerable to a Latin Jazz fan of today. A few exceptions are ""Almendra"", a Latin jazz track which is good enough to be played on any jazz station today. Also check out ""Tito's Guajira"" and ""La Ola Marina"", to complete my top 3 recommended tracks to download from this C.D. These 3 tracks are good enough to earn the CD 5 stars in my estimation. For an even better introduction to the music of the great Tito Puente, get ""Fania Salsa Classics: The Best of Tito Puente"", a 2-CD set available on Amazon.com."
5,Excelent,"From a first glance this book seems complete: it resents all the aspects of signing, of maintaining and of promoting into the music industry. But don't let it fool you it is a great book, but not the greatest you can find. In fact if you search more you'll find a much better title that will satisfy all the thirst for knowledge that a fresh business man wants . ""The Music Business Bundle"" by Ty Cohen is THE COMPLETE guide into the music industry's dark secrets. Step by step presentation and vivid examples make this a sure winner and it really shows the edge over the previous title"
1,The first example in this book is already wrong,"I did the ""look inside the book"" and saw already an error in the first schema example of listing 1.2.e.g.:<xsd:element name=""Title"" ref=""Title""><xsd:element name=""Authors"" ref=""Authors""><xsd:element name=""Publisher"" ref=""Publisher"">You can't use both the name and ref attribute at the same time.To confirm this, I validated the example both in Eclipse 3.7.1 and Altova XML Spy Enterprise Edition 2012 and had errors.This is very confusing for people who want to learn this already complex schema language."
5,Last Miller album with Tim Davis,This album is really great-the last one with Tim Davis-the drummer and sometime's lead singer from the original band-this album ranks right up there with the previous 4 albums-non commercial rock n roll-this is where Steve Miller is at his best-after this album he kind of went commercial-not as deep feeling music like on this and the previous 4 albums--I saw him at the Fillmore thru out the first 5 albums on many occasions-Get this one and previous ones and you will appreciate the real STEVE MILLER BAND-ROCK and BLUES at his best--In addition Tim Davis has two albums he made right after this-on LP only-it is definitely worth it to try to find these-sounds like the Miller Band-good lyrics and guitar-he had a good band-one of the albums is called Pipe Dream. He was a great singer and drummer--its a shame he is not living anymore-I think he died around 1978.
4,Steve Miller goes psychedelic COUNTRY!,"When I first put together my SMB collection many years ago, each of his early albums was a surprise, but perhaps none more than this one. Looking back, it seems he went boldly into territory usually associated with Michael Nesmith and the later Byrds albums. Side 1 on the LP was especially pleasant to my ears: ""Good Morning"", ""I Love You"", ""Going To The Country"", ""Hot Chili"" (who let that mariachi band in here?) and the perfect song for driving down the highway, ""Tokin's"" (DIG that BANJO playing!). Quirky, stylish, fun, and in spots downright magnificent: this one has something for everybody."
4,Number Five,"You are kidding right? This is an album that ranks up there with any Steve Miller material ever written. Maybe one of the least heard albums along with Saving Grace, but this is truely Miller at one of his best moments."
3,Cold Diggity Darn! Not Remastered!,"Limited Edition Japanese pressing of this album comes housed in a miniature LP sleeve but, it's NOT REMASTERED! This has the same sonic quality as the (much lower cost) domestic release that has been available for ages."
1,"If there were 0 stars, I would have gave that","I stopped reading this book 35% in, wished I had stopped sooner. I think I got the author's basic plot and ideas he was trying to represent through strange prose and character development. The setting and time of the story was also not explained very well. The book read as a first draft with no editor that fairly represented the reading public."
5,Callas debut-role at La Scala,"When the ""Lord of the Scala"", Ghiringelli, heard Callas as Elena in ""I vespri siciliani"" he offered her the prima of the season at La Scala, as ELENA. Not a certain ""success"" like Traviata or Rigoletto this opera must be cast perfectly to succeed. The part of Elena requires a true assoluta, since she has not only most dramatic spinto-parts to sing but a much oranmented ""Bolero"", the aria we all know. This is a live-recording made in Callas' prime. Sadly it's not the ultimate Vespri because Kokolios isn't the best Arrigo, but it is a must hear for every operalover. Mascherini, who would be Callas' Macbeth only a year later, sounds VERY well. Kleiber conducts BRILLIANTLY. An awesome live-recording."
4,Rare performance,"This is a fine addition to one's collection if one is a refined music/opera lover and Connoisseur of the works of Verdi and Maria Callas. Unfortunately, the mediocre quality of the recording subtracts one star from this rare performance of one of Giuseppe Verdi's less popular works."
2,bad storyline,The story was bad the nusic was worse the flashes of kids privates was unneeded and unwanted and the reason his mother is a dragon is because she ate 3 fish because she was starving and pregnant it was a bad story bad plot and not worth the price if it were free
3,Not what I was expecting,The plot of the film was good and I very much enjoyed the beautiful old-style animation. My main disappointment with this film was that I was expecting a fun children's film. The displays of nudity (a few shots of women's breasts and a shot of Taro's reproductive organs in the opening credits) while not in sexual situations is appropriate for children and this ruined the film for me.
2,Good intentions,"I was drawn to the attachemets first off. My first purchase was a 2 cycle but after the first season it never ran well. I upgraded to a 990r and was pleased at the power, the 4 cycle aspect and all the attachements fit. The second season it would only run with the choke at half and rough at that. I have replaced the Carb once and this year spent three hours with it to get it running constantly then after 5 min of use the trigger broke. It probably needs a new carb again, not pleased with the quality but like the concept."
2,Buyer Beware,Ryobi is a moderate price trimmer compared to other brands. The unit has a lot of power and is easy to use. But the equipment has a lot of negatives. Ryobi products are hard to start and the reliability of the product drops rapidly as time passes. Replacement parts are high. The tap feeder works OK but rewinding and replacing line can be difficult. ... Virtually all the Ryobi trimmers received poor marks. I will never buy another Ryobi product.
2,Low power/low quality,Bought an 890R from the local home center several years back...and had to return it within 3 days..[bad carb].the next one [although it ran] lasted 1 week before the auto feed spool broke..took it to my neighborhood lawnmower shop to have manual feed spool installed...and while there found the holy grail of string trimmers...the one and one half horse power Honda....traded in the less than one hp ryobi on the spot and have had zero problems since...the Honda costs more but is well worth it.
2,PROBLEMS W/ 6MONTHS,"GOOD FOR LIGHT WEED-WACKING. WITHIN 1ST 6 MONTHS OF USING, HAD CARB VALVE GO BAD & PROP SHAFT BREAK - FINDING REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR D.I.Y'S COULD BE MADE EASIER. DO NOT PURCHASE IF LOOKING FOR HEAVY DUTY / BRUSH WACKER"
3,"Great concept, poor execution.","The ability to use add-on accessories is what motivated me to buy this unit. However, the basic functionality leaves something to be desired. It is off-balance requiring you to constantly fight it to keep it straight. And it produces bone jarring vibration. They really need to do a better job of balancing the engine and isolating it from the shaft."
2,Ryobi 890R 4-Cycle trimmer,"I bought my ryobi 2 seasons ago. It has ran well with the exception of 1 time, after I let a neighbor borrow it. It ran bad when I got it back and they had used dirty gas. I fixed it myself by spraying the carb out. I have never had a problem with the motor or power, other than what is mentioned above. At the end of this last season however, I did manage to break the upper flexible driveshaft trimming some light grass in a fence row (done every 2-3 weeks). I never would have expected this from a ""brush cutter.""Ryobi's website is not much help, they do have manuals and parts diagrams pdfs to download. 2 out of the 5 service centers (listed on the site) I have taken it to for repair do not even service them. The motor still runs good, so I will look into fixing the shaft myself as I get time, but I wish I had gone with Stihl. My father-in-law had a ryobi and several of the attachments so that is why I looked at this model. He has since bought a stihl as a replacement."
1,Jury is out?,"The concept got me too. Unfortunately, the product failed to fulfill the promise. It was difficult to start from day one, a guaranteed blister every time. I mean, I have had some genuine moments trying to get this thing started, let's just leave it at that. Once it finally was warmed up and would stay running, it was good. I used it on some serious weeds. The brush cutter was nice for the thicker stuff. I also own the blower/vac and hedge trimmer accessories. I don't know if they work as well as a stand-alone version would, but they work well enough and it's worth it for the convenience.I was able to use it for two seasons (an event to start everytime), but now the engine is running poorly. Like others have said, good concept needs better motor."
1,JUNK-OBI 990 Brushcutter,"I am writing a review for a 990 Brushcutter not a 890.When I bought this big hunk of junk I thought I was getting a trimmer that would help me out in my yard. Unfortunately, I have only been able to use it a couple of times due to I dont know what or why but this beast does not like to start up and accelerate. If you are lucky enough to get it to start, as soon as you give it some throttle, it goes blahhhhhh....I have had a couple of people look at it whom I know to have lots of engine experience that have not been able to do much. Customer service is the pitts, and if you want something to cut some weeds down in your yard, dont buy a Ryobi. PURE GARBAGE !!"
1,A very bad book,"Poorly written book with very poor pictures. I hoped to find there much more information than in very compact (but as I now could see much better written) manual of F100. Instead I found unclear ""explanations"", not finished desriptions and much less technical information than in the manual. (e.g. no errors description at all)Don't buy it! Read carefully the manual, you will save some time and money."
2,Disappointment,"I consider myself an advanced novice. I bought an F100 and was looking for a book with some depth. This one disappointed. Yeah, it explained the features to a point, but there was minimal guidance on how to effectively use those features."
2,impossible to follow the story,"The apology in the booklet reads, ""We would have loved to print the complete libretto including the English and French translations on the following pages.""But, this could unfortunately not be done due to the high financial requests on the part of the publisher. We regret this very much and hope, however, that we are able to be of service to you with a detailed synopsis.""The ""detailed synopsis"" isn't much help, either. It refers to band numbers, but when you play the CD on your computer, the band numbers don't appear on the computer screen.Unless you already know the opera, or unless you can find a score or libretto, or unless you are fluent in German, find a recording by a company which is more considerate of the consumer."
2,waste of jim norton,i bought this movie just because little jim norton was on the box cover....hes actually in the movie for about 4 total min and his emmey award winning performance involves him starring at a wall with a stupid look on his face....other then that its a pretty silly....super low budget film and its watchable...sort of
1,It stinks and I don't like it,It was just not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be good and well.
1,This SUCKS the whole system sucks,"This movie sucked so bad that I could'nt even finish it. I love you Jimmy but this movie was awful. It wasn't you Jimmy it was everybody else. Sorry dude, O&A rules."
4,Excellent shelf,"This is a lovely shelf, it is nicely made and looks good installed. I would recommend careful consideration of placement BEFORE you purchase it particularly if you are intending to install it rather than hang it on the wall. Installation is BETWEEN two studs, so considerations would be if the location you choose is where you want it ( you can't move it side to side at all) and also if your studs are standard width apart (not all are) If you can validate that both cases are correct, then installation of this shelf will be a breeze and it will look terrific!The only thing I might like different is the option for glass shelves so I could install lights in the top and have them sine through. Doing so ""aftermarket"" shouldn't be difficult."
3,"Looks good, didn't include specifications","This looked good and was exactly what I wanted. Unfortunately it was impossible to find out before I bought it how big the hole in the wall needed to be, which is standard information with other brands of niche or recessed cabinets. This needed 14.25 inches, and my studs were exactly 14 inches apart. I put it away to use for later project in another room. Also, there are lots of sites with this product, and the prices vary greatly."
2,Does not work for what I needed it for,"I purchased this to make cake pops, but the cake mix sticks to the stainless steel. but the quality of the item is good."
5,Fox Run 277 Stainless Steel Meatballer,"Nice size meatballer I really like it, looking forward to the future when I get time to use it more."
5,Wow!,Heavy duty for grip that attaches nicely to your Quad rail system. Fits nice and tight and look fantastic on your AK or you AR. Quick deliver too!
1,Does not include brackets or mounting hardware!!!,"I purchased this based on the picture and item description thinking I was going to receive everything I needed to have a mounted towel bar (brackets, mounting hardware, bar). I was very disappointed when I opened the box and found out that what was included was ONLY the square bar itself. I feel that the listing is very misleading!"
3,NOT S-size,"I ordered Small size, but youI receive much more bigger than Small size. More like M size.So size information here are WrONG!"
2,Not too helpful for me,"Having read this book twice, it simply is not for me, nor would I strongly recommend it. While the scholarship is evidently good, I can't see anything in here which an accomplished scholar of Hinduism wouldn't already know, nor can I see this as a particularly helpful introduction to Hinduism for beginners. Yes, it does get the idea of ""Darsan - seeing the divine"" down well, and debunks the Western criticisms and shallow reactions to Hinduism. I cannot see, however, how this would be useful to an introductory student of Hinduism, because it is far too brief and the manuscript wanders freely from topic to topic, asking far too many questions, giving too little context and in-depth answers. I feel like this was originally a scholarly essay which turned into a book, and which probably worked better as a shorter scholarly essay. A good topic, but not the best read I would say."
3,needed this book for a class,purchased this book for an art history course but it wasn't anything specialthe writing is knowledgable and well composed but otherwise not too impressed
5,Great!,The book arrived right on time for when I needed it for class. I've learned a lot from it. Great book. :)
3,"Interesting, yet over-simplified","The book was interesting, especially the way the photographs were incorporated in with the text, however for a person with knowledge of the Hindu religion, it is a boring and redundant book. Concepts and ideas are greatly simplified for the uninformed reader, so the book is not very appropriate for one with much knowledge of Hinduism. Ideas tended to be overstated and overexplained. In my opinion, the book could've been half its size and still been just as clear, concise and in-depth."
2,Not dependable,"I have had this machine for 3 years now, and it has been sent back to the manufacturer 3 times... Stay away, many problems."
4,"Arrived Quickly, Cheaper than at store","This arrived very quickly. Price is a little cheaper than at the store. Otherwise this is the same product. Works ok, but doesn't cure athelete's feet fungus."
3,"Not a ""2-pack""","Nothing wrong with this product as far as I can tell, but do not be deceived: this is not a ""2-pack."" It is a single .85 oz. tube, same as your local drug store carries for about $3 less. Save your money. First time I've ever felt cheated by Amazon."
3,Very informative but...,"This book seems to dish as much dirt on Nicole and her ""inner circle"" friends as it does on O.J. himself--at times, Weller seems to simultaneously praise and criticize many of the key players in the O.J. Simpson saga. The fact that she particularly criticizes and talks badly about Faye Resnick (and indirectly accuses her of having led Nicole into a lifestyle that angered and enraged Simpson) is very unfroffessional and done in poor taste. The fact that the Brown family had a well-publicized dispute with Weller because of the things she wrote here comes as no surprise (as does the fact that the Goldman family refused to be interviewed by her)."
4,Up Close and Personal,"This book gives a true inside look at the relationship between O.J. and Nicole from the very beginning. Since so many of the sources were family and friends of both O.J. and Nicole's, I tend to believe them. Such a sad story, but well worth reading for a rounded picture of their life together. So many books on this subject focus on the trial, while this book ends at that point. When looking at the whole story, it seems to be a textbook case of a battered woman...especially seeing as how young Nicole was when she hooked up with O.J. and for his part, a textbook case of an abuser and in my opionion, a selfish killer. I recommend this book to all of those interested in personal information not told in the ""trial"" books."
2,Corny waste of decent characters,"I have always felt the Archie/Red Circle/Impact set of super heroes were being wasted. These heroes would be better spent integrated into the DC Universe than in the failed Impact line of comics from the early 1990's. These characters have stretched from the Golden Age (The Shield pre-dated Captain America as a patriotic hero) to the modern age, but never have they mattered (except maybe the Golden Age Shield).This graphic novel is from the Red Circle era and places all the main heroes into one super team. Fly-Man, The Comet, The Shield, The Web, and others are written in high, dumbed down, camp. If you thought the 1960's Batman television series was campy, it has nothing on the Red Circle era heroes. The stories have plot holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through, the villains and heroes are both laughable, and the comedy is awful. Such of waste of potentially good characters, but you wouldn't know it from reading this."
1,Id pass.,"Richard Basehart missed the boat this time as awful Adolph.A better version is 1944 The Hitler Gang,Robert Watson is much better as the deviant nazi dictator.From his days at the close of WW1 to his power rise due to double crossing and murders.Roman Bohnen is especially good as brown shirt chief Ernest Rohm.Martin Kosleck repeats his role as Goebells.Narrated by Walter Abel and Albert Dekker.Dir by Hohn Farrow."
4,pleasantly surprised at more twists than i predicted,"it is a cop action movie that feels like a open ended mystery (the audience doesn't know who did it and has to figure it out as the main character does).It has several interesting and, to me, unexpected twists. Worth watching as closely as you would to Columbo or Perry Mason, not shallowly like a strictly action genre.I appreciated this, these twists and false rabbit holes, it not only kept the movie moving and interesting but were deep enough that i missed several, a real treat.I hope that the world isn't like the movie, that our cities aren't built by people like this with such greedy motivations, but as i get older, i wonder more and hope less for the good to triumph."
3,pretty good,"saw this film the other night and it was quite interesting with the chick trying to pass as Black. Ray Liotta and LL Cool J really have good chemistry in this film. this just might be LL's best acting performance yet. Liotta has been type cast for years for his earlier career roles,but he turns in a good performance here. this film flips back and forth at times. Mekhi Phifer does a good job as well."
4,A knotty naughty film for fans of noir,"Ford Cole's (Liotta) got some political ambitions. Unfortunately, he's got to get rid of a shadow-man to realize his move from DA to mayor. Danny Luden's a shadow--some say he's got at least a dozen people with fake IDs claiming to be him just to keep ahead of the law....Add to that, his prize ADA and lover Nora (Jolene Blalock) has a dead man in her bed. She's claiming the man raped her, but the evidence is stacking up against her. Add to that, an is-she-or-isn't-she question about Jolene's racial identity and you've got viewers attention.Stir in LL Cool J as an informant with the dirt on just about everyone and you've taken the plot from simmer to boil....""Slow Burn"" is aptly titled and it's great contemporary noir. It's rare I don't figure out the solution well in advance of the end and this is one of those films that kept me guessing until the end. Plus, the music chosen for the soundtrack is superb.Rebecca Kyle, December 2009"
5,Must See!,"Movie received in good order and delivery time. If you haven't seen this one, you're missing out. A personal favorite. Great cast and story."
3,The life of an paratrooper in the invasion of Panama.,"This is an easy read of the story of the 82nd Airborne in the invasion of Panama. Briggs served in this unit as a First Lt, and he describes his experiences in Operation Just Cause. His unit occupied the city of Colon and came into conflict with the PDF and the Dignity Battalions. Since the conflict was not short, that means the book is also short, about 155 pages total.The one thing this fails to relate is why the conflict took place. This is purely the experiences of a small unit in this small conflict. If one wants to understand why the United States invaded Panama in 1989, one has to read elsewhere, such as in The Fall of Tyrants. A pleasant read about a small conflict which lasted a few days. I like Briggs description of the evolving roles the military has to play in the conflict from combatant to constable. This is relevant to our present status in Iraq."
4,Good for the money,"I purchased this item as a gift for my son. Installation was fast and easy. I did like the way that it mounted by using a single ""C"" clamp. I have used the type that are supported by tightening 3 screws in the past and have never had them hold up. The only negative thing that I can say is that overall, it is a little large for our application."
1,rip off zero stars!,this is total rip off bootleg version of a good album. its not in stereo and the sound is terrible. save your money. im sure Ringo is not not aware of this reissue
4,Don't STOP - Buy this album!,"This is one of Ringo's best solo efforts. I always liked Ringo's solo stuff especially when the material fits with his image or personality. This was accompished with a little help from his friends, Paul McCartney, George Harrison,Harry Nilsson and others. My favorite tracks are ""Drumming is my Madness"", ""Attention"", ""Wrack my Brain"", a 'new' version of ""Back of Boogaloo"" (featuring a tour of references to Beatles and earlier solo songs), and the title track. As others have mentioned, great adlibbing by Ringo on that. The price of the album is worth it just for the adlibbing! Ringo, a fan of country music, included a version of a favorite, ""Sure to Fall"".This album was mostly recorded in mid 1980 and released just 2 months after John Lennon was killed. While it doesn't include a corny cash-in tribute song to his Beatle brother, the album with its good natured feeling, had a real positive effect after such sadness. How typical of Ringo!"
1,Sounds awful,Should be NO STARS but I am asked to give at least one. The Amazon mp3 downloads are terrible. Bad sound quality and MONO. Someone let me hear the original CD and I can't believe the contrast. Night and day. Find a CD copy.
2,Hilarious title track and an interesting bonus track,"The title track, co-written with buddy Harry Nilsson, is a hoot, as is bonus track 'You Can't Fight Lightning', but the rest of the album is rather lame, unless you go for old-time crooners and Harrison/McCartney throwaways. Hard to believe that his next album, `Old Wave', would be such a huge improvement, with a few Beatlesworthy originals/covers and some non-Beatle-ish classics. Trouble is, it was only released in Canada and Germany. So `Stop and Smell...' was pretty well IT for Ringo in the 1980s. Until he dried out and took his first All-Starr band on the road. That would be the first step toward the highly successful regeneration of his recording and performing career."
4,The best albums are always put out of print,"Ringo's ""Stop And Smell The Roses"" continues the saga than began in 1973-74 with the albums ""Ringo"" and ""Goodnight Vienna"". The post beatles collaborations are always present in Ringo's albums, something that continued with his most recent recording: Vertical Man. ""Stop And Smell The Roses"" is one of his 5 best albums, and, pitifully, it is now out of print...I wish I have it on cd format, because it is an excellent album"
5,"Excellent Show, shame it ended.","I started to watch this show because of Alex O'Loughlin and glad to report I am glad I did. What a great show, yes some of it is predictable, but the characters are great.It is a shame it only had 1 season, but in a way I am glad. I think Alex O'Loughlin is perfect in Hawaii 5-0."
5,Envigorating,"I too cannot believe they are canceling this show. The cast is phenomenal, the story riveting and who can so no to Alex O'Loughlin as a sexy vampire?! Shame on CBS but yay to Amazon for providing the show for download. I can't wait for the entire first season to come out on DVD so I can take it with me wherever my computer is not :) Keep up the fight! Vampire Solidarity Rah Rah Rah!!!"
5,"Wait, Wait, It's... it's awesome","Ok so it started off well and then about the time of the writers strike it had a bad episode that could have killed this for me and then bam, I don't know what happened but suddenly the story is flying the action is interesting and the forever knight remake is reborn with new power and vigor not seen since, well forever knight. The episodes are great except for one and even though they are good they keep getting better and better. This has that real touch that goes so well with honest in your face fantasy, like dead like me? the dead zone? you'll like this. it's a keeper."
3,fantastic,It was a realy good show.But vampires are suppose to work at night. Not in the day time.The action was realy good too. Blood Ties is better though.The vampire can bite my neck anytime.
2,These Are Our Heroes?,"To read this review in its entirety please visit [...]:I really want to believe that this series is building towards something. I'm not overly optimistic by what I saw on this volume though. While this opening volume wasn't bad, I really didn't feel like I gained much by watching these episodes when I really think that I could possibly go into the next volume and be fine if I had just been given a vague summary of these episodes. I go into the next volume with caution but I sure don't recommend this one."
2,Done before...,"Okay, seriously...the vampire private investigator has been done to death in books, movies, and TV Shows. I don't think we needed another series."
5,la plaza del diamante,"Este libro es excelente de principio a fin,no conozco mucho de esta escritora pero me encantaria leer algo mas de ella,su lenguage es claro y sencillo,su novela es informativa ,la descripcion de sus personajes es fabulosa como tambien la del ambiente que los rodea."
5,As Long as the Moon Shall Rise,"Do you enjoy the moon? Are you a bit of a romantic? Are you looking for some unique ways to show love, express affection, for a dear person in your life. . .friend, or lover?? This book has some great ideas, and presents some wonderful opportunities for creative sharing to develop loving relationships by the light of the moon! For anyone who has enjoyed moon-gazing, who loves the moonlight, who enjoys creative ways to deepen relationships. . . this book is a great introduction, guide, inspiration!! I love it."
4,Duplicate Game,"When I ordered this game many months ago it was titled Titanic:Hunt for lost treasure. When i finally recieved it it was Titanic: Hidden Expedition which i had already gotten from Big Fish Games. Now I have a duplicate game that cost 3 times as much. However, the game itself is really fun. Its kind of on the order of I spy games with extra puzzles. I recommend the game itself I just wish Amazon would have listed the right title for it."
3,Middle of the road game,"I have played many hidden picture games to date, and this one was just okay. The ending is very anti-climactic, and the game gets easier each time you play it. I play this one for mindless entertainment, but I play one of the others in my collection when I want a challenge. Don't buy this one--you can do better."
2,"fun, but short and repetitive",Hidden object games are entertaining and this one is no exception but it was too short and used many of the same backgrounds. I had more fun with the Atlantis edition that I think this company makes.
5,Super Titanic,"Great Game---Hours of Fun, you certainly get your monies worth. Love all the Big Fish Games."
5,Titanic,"Awesome, easy to use, games have puzzles at the end to put together, pictures to match makes it a little more challenging."
3,Hidden Expedition: Titanic review,"Has been much fun. Kids have really enjoyed it. For the adults, it figures out to be pretty easy. Would recommend it for kids age 4-8."
3,Slide well,"The slider surface works great on the bottom of my kitchen chair across a wood floor, but the sticking pad used to attach the slider to the foot of the chair came off in about three days. So now I've glued them on. I'll try them again at dinner."
2,Oldies Lover,"There are a lot of songs on this CD that I don't remember & don't really care for. However, the sound quality is good. Take the time to listen to all the samples before buying."
5,album,some of the best music from the 60's. this is a very memorable album and brought back some great memories
5,Brings back great memories,I was going through some of my old LP albums and I had a Gary Puckett album and decided to see what I could find. I found this one and love it. It brings back some great old memories. Love to sing along just like I did when I was a teenager.
3,"Good, but I can't give it 5 stars","I bought this on a whim. I knew of ""Young Girl"" from a TV show, so I was tempted when I saw the CD on sale. I sampled a few of the tracks (I think ""To Love Somebody"" and another) and liked them well enough, so figured I could risk six bucks. I generally like the album enough to whistle some tunes at work, although it is not really my type of music (in the Robert Goulet/Tom Jones genre).It is obvious the group had talent, and all songs sounded professional though some were uninspiring.Best ones:""Young Girl""""Woman, Woman""""To Love Somebody"" (Originally a Bee Gees song, covered by everyone it seems)""Lady Willpower""The rest is mostly forgettable, though ""This Girl Is A Woman Now"" had a kind of interesting slant. ""Kentucky Woman"" seemed a bit out of place. The total run time is a bit skimpy at 28:10. So, while I can't give it 5 stars, if ""the oldies"" is your style, you can't go wrong here."
4,Buy this album if only for one song...,"I listened to the Union Gap on the radio in the 60's and 70's, but never considered myself a big fan. That changed about 20 years ago when I first heard the song, ""Home,"" which is only on this album. As a Vietnam vet, I can't begin to describe the emotions that surface when I listen to the evocative lyrics. With the Iraq war raging and young men again dying, this song speaks for yet another generation. After wearing out a cassette version, I recently bought the CD and continue to enjoy the album."
4,The Voice?,"If Gary Puckett were in his prime now, he'd have to be on ""The Voice."" The man was an amazing singer. I saw him and his band at Constitution Hall in Wash. DC right at the peak of their run. His vocals filled the place from wall to wall and is still very memorable to this day. I've since seen other artists there like Bonnie Raitt, Jon Cleary, BB King, Elvis Costello but none with his particular talent. Many rock singers struggle to be heard over the band, but for Puckett, it was no problem."
3,Blue diamond,"Own it for last 2 monthsPROSDoes the jobLooks sturdyGreat warranty, although never used it.Works for L shaped pools and different. Shapes. Great controllerCleans every corner , never needed a remote control but remote is a plusCONS :Hook up between swivel control is cumbersomeCaddy isn't sturdy, swivel cord hardly fits the caddyIt's too heavy, especially when u take it out of the water, sometimes debris falls back.Don't like cleaning the bag after u r done.Reliability: . Will tell u in a yearOVERALl. I think it's worth it, no more manual pool cleaning."
1,"Poorly made, save your money","Motor failed just out of warranty; fix cost over $400. Flimsy parts, tabs that break easily. Cleans pool, but you'll find sediment back on the bottom within an hour. Save your money and go with a cheap cleaner; results likely to be the same."
1,Real Bad,"I can see why A&M wouldn't let Rick Wakeman release this and tried to bury the masters. If only they had succeeded. I have listed to the Official sountrack to this abysmal movie for years and I loved it, but this remaster rerelease really sucks."
5,This Stuff Works,"I've tried everything to grow my short, thin nails; tried this, and it worked. They are so long now I have to CUT them -- a first!!!"
3,Typical buy,Well this product could be better... I mean it didnt nesacarily make my nails grow any faster than they usually do. But they did grow and hard. Rather than my regular flimsy nails.
1,i gave it half a star in my library database,"I think I paid a couple of bucks on this only and I still think was too much. Leaving aside the fact that the movies are obscure and that they probably deserve to be, the transfers are at the best standard definition, there are no caps and no features. This is not the first time I am dissapointed by Mill Creek Ent."
2,gas range top,Not very happy with this product. I had to fix one of knobs for the burner with epoxy to get it to stay on. One of the racks over the burner is slanted as the screw top for the holes for the top to screw into the counter is in the way of where the hole for the rack is supposed to go. We bought two of these stove tops and they are not holding up after only two months of use.
2,Doesn't live up to promise,"I purchased these spoons thinking that they'd be a handy way to avoid the sometimes messy ""wrist checks"" for the temperature of the food.. However, these spoons, rather than changing color when the food is too hot, go white at anything other than room temperature, making it necessary to do the wrist-check for anything that is even slightly warmed up.This means that they're essentially color-changing disposable plastic spoons that are slightly smaller than adult plastic spoons and worlds more expensive.[...]: Reviews of Everything Baby"
4,Best spoons I've found so far,"These spoons are the perfect size for first feeders. The bowl of the spoon is narrow and not too deep, so the food actually gets into my son's mouth. These are really light too, unlike the spoons that have metal conponents. Don't go with the more expensive spoons. These work the best, are cheap and are BPA free and recyclable!"
5,Take and toss- toss? I think not!!,"These are great spoons for infants-- they are small, but that is perfect for little mouths, otherwiseyou have food all over their face!The Gerber baby spoons, which have been used for years and are great, have that soft lining. Once they getteeth, however, baby always wants to chew on the spongy part of those spoons! Maybe it's me, but I don'tlike the chewed-on look;) These are not tempting to chew on, which I really like :)Sturdy little spoons, can be used again and again!"
1,Do not buy this edger attachment... a waste of money.,"I received it and I ground a cutting edge on the blade. Then, I started edging and I found that the Ryobi engine was bogged down by the work of the edger. I kept the throttle wide open as I edged but the edger could not cut very well. I actually twisted off the upper shaft in less than 10 minutes of edging. (The edger slowed down the driven rpm's, but the engine speed was up.) So, the Ryobi is great for a string trimmer or a blower, but NOT for use with the edger."
4,Works as advertised,"This add-on edger definitely works as well as I expected. It takes a little getting used to but does a great job once you get the hang of it. The debris flap on the back side is pretty useless, so make sure you're wearing pants while edging. This is the first add-on I've purchased for my Ryobi 725r and am quite happy with it's performance."
1,not up to the job,I am on my third Powerhead for this attachment. I just dont think it has enough power for the job. Th cable that turns the attachment ends up breaking. I think it works fine as a trimmer but if your going to do a fair ammount of edging save your money and buy a dedicated edging machine.
4,Nice add-on for 725r,"The edger does a nice, easy job except for the first edge of the season, which takes a little extra time. If you can't find a Ryobi replacement blade, bring the blade to your local lawnmower shop for a generic replacement."
5,A Great Add-on,"I just purchased one of these Add-on Lawn Edgers to be used on my 4 cycle 775R and I am very pleased with it! There's lots of edging power, although my first time using it was somewhat time-consuming as I had to dig out the trenches next to the sidewalk. I would think that this should get easier with each use. You get a nice clean cut and don't use up your string, which always seemed to go quickly when hitting the concrete. One note: this edger works better by moving it back and forth rather than a continuous push."
4,"Good product, took some time to master.","My initial try with the edger was not a very pleasant one. I was using the edger as you would expect, walking forward cutting little by little. I experienced a lot of jams and engine stops. Later I discovered that the thing works wonderfuly better walking backwards. The blade spin works a lot better this way. Once I discovered this, my edging experience has been wonderfull but odd at the same time."
1,Power? Control? This little edger has none,"This edger might be useful for a tiny townhouse patio, but if you have more than 10 feet of edging to do, look to a dedicated edging unit and not this substandard add-on. The trimmer itself is a great unit and I have no complaints--but the edger add-on only has one guide wheel which makes it difficult to cut a straight line. The power is also insufficient to chew through grass and dirt if you've waited more than a week from your last edging. Spend your edging dollars elsewhere..."
1,"Easy to see, but really hard to use.","I was drawn to this phone because of how it looked in the store. All numbers are visable when you aren't wearing reading glasses. After nearly a month of trying to figure out how to work with it, I am giving up and returning it. First problem is that you often have to dial the number several times before it makes the call. Worst problem,I could not get the answering machine message to kick in - ever. All calls went to my phone company voice mail which is more inconvenient than just pushing a message button the way I did on my last 3 answering machines. Then the phone would flash until I retrieved my voice mail from the phone company at least twice. Even after deleting the voice mail, the phone flashed. It was maddening. Too many bells and whisles, poor basic operation."
1,"Too many problems, never again.","Got this phone and a couple extra handsets. Within a few months ALL of the handsets have lines through them (pixels that won't light up). Answering machine quality is very low, playbacks are always choppy and seems to cut off the end of messages (the latter being a common complaint). When power is lost the answering machine looses track of time, and unlike almost every other answering machine out there, it will not set itself from the time received on caller-id, so you have to manually set the time every time the lights blink, or you get bad timestamps on the answering machine.Shall I keep going or just admit that this is another GE piece of junk that I should have known better than to buy in the first place."
1,No Speed Dialing!,Got this for my technology-challenged uncle and had to take it back. No speed dialing - what is up with THAT!? The clerk at the store didn't believe me but he looked through the book too and had to agree he couldn't find anything about that either.
1,Awful!!,"I purchased this phone for my grandmother. It was exactly like her old one, big keys and large screen. It turns it is a piece of crap! The LCD screen you can only partially read and the sound quality stinks. I just found out when I called my grandmother up to ask her about the phone. She is not using it cause another grandson, my cousin, went to walmart and got her a better quality phone for less. It is crappy quality like this that discourages online shopping."
4,Toyman's review,Product just as expected. ring level and tone very good and provides adequate lodness for people of dimished hearing to hear.
1,Amplified isn't the word.,"Good phone for someone who can hear. It says ""mild hearing loss"" and it has amplified booster. However, it disappoints me. Depending on who is on the other end of the phone, two-thirds of the voices are so hard to hear clearly that I find myself melding the phone into my ear. If the caller is on a headset or cell phone, forget it. Might as well use two tin cans on a string. I had to go back to my good ole corded phone which works just fine except I can't walk around with it unless I drag the 25 ft cord around. The ""audio boost"" button only boosts it a tiny bit - not enough, plus the ear piece/speaker is tiny too. If one is needing an ""amplified"" phone, better go for the free phones offered through ear doctors - they are the ""real thing"". My hearing loss is ""mild"" but with this phone I feel like my hearing is non-existant."
1,Phone without handsets,"Looks like this would be a great phone if you can find the extra handset to go with it. I found a model number for the handsets but couldn't find anyone selling them. Since I can't really use the phone with only one handset, I give GE a one star for getting the cart before the horse."
1,Not Worth Listening To,This must be some type of bootleg. It sounds like excerpts from the wildlife concert. It does not give you a concert experience at all. There are so many better JD items to listen to. Don't spend your money or time on this.
5,Wonderful! A Must Have For Fans!,"This is a great CD! It starts out with ""Over The Rainbow"", with dialouge, and ends with ""Chicago"". The songs that were selected to be put on the CD were wonderful. Listen to ""It's a Great Day For the Irish"" or ""Jamboree Jones"" (from The Judy Garland show, before this, not-realeased) and the classical ""Over The Rainbow"" Get yourself one, and listen to it. You'll like it too!"
3,"i would buy this, but i cant figure out what comes in the set, and the overseas person who answered my call, couldnt either.","this is so irritating, i would love to buy this item, but amazon only sends their phone questions overseas, to people who can read what i am reading on the website. no one can answer my question, so i have no idea what i would be buying, if i were to buy this. so, im not, and i will buy it on olive kids."
5,Newer Editions,"I own a copy of this edition and would not want to get rid of it since it covers some older technology that I find interesting (I even own and still use some of that old stuff). That said this is not the current version of the book.The book has been renamed ""Handbook for Sound Engineers, Fourth Edition"" and is now in its 4th Edition. Glen Ballou is now the editor, and I wrote two chapters in the last two editions.Amazon stocks the current edition which makes it easy to find and buy :>)Ray A. Rayburn - Fellow of the Audio Engineering Society"
2,Not enough power?,"This was purchased as a gift. After being put together the motor seemed unable to pull the weight of the H2. Was this a problem for anyone else? Such a disappointment after taking all the time to build it. Even though it didn't work as expected, it still was fun and educational to put together."
