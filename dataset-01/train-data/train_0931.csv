5,Perfect to use on top of futon mattress,"I bought this to help cushion a futon mattress, and I couldn't be happier with it! It's super comfy and a great deal!! I would recommend this topper for anyone that's looking for a something to add cushion! I read some reviews about the mattress topper being too hot, but this one has holes for ventilation and it isn't making anyone who sleeps on it too hot or warm for that matter. (Phoenix gets hot)Well worth the price!!"
1,"Revolting, powerful odor","There's a small slip of paper included with this product that warns that the product may have a ""Fresh Foam"" smell.If you're set on buying this, make sure you have an outdoor space you can air this out for at least a few days. I live in an apartment where no such space exists. My entire apartment now strongly reeks of ""Fresh Foam,"" which, to me, smells like being trapped inside a box of Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies. The odor is so strong in my apartment that I'm literally dizzy. Sleeping on the pad, even with it wrapped in layers of sheets, is impossible. I cannot overstate how powerful the scent is.Needless to say, I'm sending this back to Amazon. I need to get it out of my apartment as fast as possible. I'll never buy bedding online again."
5,Buy this!,"I never write reviews, but this thing is awesome. I had really bad back pain in the mornings and couldn't even bend over...after buying this, the pain is gone! I even tried physical therapy, but just by simply adding this mattress topper, it's taken away all my back pain! So comfy and I loved the green tea scent!"
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I bought this item to replace a memory foam topper (1.5"") that I adore, but needed a new one because of upgrading to a bigger bed. I bought this brand instead, since the brand of my current topper was sold out in the Queen size. This item seems very well made, but the difference is lying down on it; I am pretty disappointed. I've used memory foam toppers for years, and unfortunately, like previous reviewers said this does not feel like a heavier density memory foam. It is actually even hotter than my 1.5"" topper that is 3lb density memory foam (I can feel my skin start to heat up wherever it touches the foam within about 3 minutes). I've had this item for an hour, and I'm returning it to get another brand. I'm glad everyone else seems to enjoy theirs, but this is not for me."
3,Effective...smelly,"Has a tea/ pepperminty smell when you first open it. That takes several weeks to go away. It is way too strong to sleep with till atleast 3 weeks. Quite effective after that, though not that great value."
3,Overpowering odor! DO NOT put this on your bed without airing it out!,"The day this mattress topper arrived, my husband and I were so excited to try it that we didn't heed the many warnings in the Amazon customer reviews alluding to the odor emitted by this thing. After airing it out for only a few hours, we made the bed with it the same evening, thinking that the subtle menthol smell coming from it would be no big deal. WRONG. It was absolutely overpowering, leading to a couple of bad headaches on my part and middle-of-the-night dizziness on my husband's part. Early the next morning the thing came off the bed and was relocated to another room to air out. Even after the topper was removed that morning, the whole bedroom smelled like a Vicks VapoRub factory!So we are letting the mattress topper air out for a couple of weeks before we try it again. I will update this review at the time to let you know how it goes."
5,Great addition to my current mattress,"I bought this mattress topper after buying a 10 inch memory foam mattess that was awful. This topper made all the difference in the world. Now I get in the bed and don't want to get back out, I just wanna lay there. Thanks for a great product. There is a slight smell, but it smells like mint to me, so it does not bother me. (Allen's wife)"
5,SO FREAKIN COMFY,"I LOVE THIS THING. Too bad it kinda slowly moves off your college bunk and doesn't really fit any other beds after you move out of the dorms. Otherwise, its hella soft."
4,great value,"Have used this product for 2 weeks and have found the mattress topper to be very comfortable. Sleep better and don't have aches previously experienced. My wife also sleeps better. Given that foam mattresses can cost over $1K, this product is a great value. I'ld give a rating of 5 stars if I had owned it longer - 10 days is a short period and a longer period is needed to arrive at a more informed judgment."
5,Love this!,"I was expecting company and wanted to buy something to make our twin bed more comfortable. The existing mattress was very hard and uncomfortable and I couldn't imagine having a guest sleep on it. After much research, I ordered this mattress enhancer. It arrived quickly and I unrolled it to let it ""rest and breathe"". There was no smell or ""wait time"" needed for it to reach its full potential. When we made the bed, it was so comfortable that I was proud to have a guest use the bed and would have liked to sleep on it myself. It feels like we purchased a new (expensive) mattress. Since buying this, I have seen memory foam that has not felt any better for 3 or more times the cost. This was a wonderful deal for a wonderful product. Don't hesitate to buy it!"
5,Awesome!,"Seriously, one of the best purchases I've ever made. I bought it for my bed at college, and it has made a world of difference. The mattress is so comfortable that I actually have a hard time falling asleep when I go back home. Highly recommended"
3,Okay,"Bought this for my son's bed because he loves the one my husband and i have on our bed. This topper is fine but not as dense as the one I bought at BJ's a few years ago. Nothing wrong with it, smell not bad, comfortable, but I don't think it will last as long as mine. Will not return but will not buy again."
4,Just what I needed,"Used this to renew a 10yr old mattress that is still holding it's own, but could use a little more support. Had back/disc troubles so wanted more support without being to firm and found this mattress topper to be just what my bed needed. Don't know what I would have done without it after back surgery! Very comfortable! Did add enough height to mattress to make some of my sheets fit not quite right. So be careful buying sheets, and get the deeper fitting ones."
5,life changing,"buy a cheap mattress and throw this thing on top. very comfortable, very. totally worth the money any day of the week."
5,memory foam matress pad,"I didn't think to order a twin size, so i got a queen size,so I just cut it to fit my bed.Very much more comfortable than I thought it would be.I like the fact that it is ventilated.I put it on top of my brand new pillow top matress.I love it"
5,In-laws love it,"I have slept with a memory foam mattress pad for years and think they're great. We bought this pad last year for my wife's parents and they love it ! They said they didn't need one because they said their mattress was already comfortable. I ordered it anyways and now they say they will never go back.Some memory foam pads have a weird chemical smell ton them, but this one has a pleasant minty smell when its new."
4,Made my back straighter the first night,"I won't lie, my husband and I both woke up in pain after the first night. However, as many others have reported, it is a different kind of pain. It was fascinating to look in the mirror and see myself standing straighter and walking straighter from better spine alignment. We have been using it 3-4 weeks now and it definitely is not as ""cushy"" as it started out, but it still has extended the life of our sagging mattress. And ours smelled of the green tea treatment and we found it to be a lovely relaxing and clean scent for bed. Will purchase another when this one is done."
5,Mattress topper,I bought this for my son to take to college. He loves it. His room mate said he spent the same for his and you can barely feel it.
5,Awesome product! Awesome customer service!,"The first one I received from Amazon was defective, I called the manufacturer and they promptly sent me a new one for free which was perfect. Very comfortable to sleep on. Its on my college dorm bed and I have no complaints about it."
5,Great product!,I purchased this because I wanted a quick solution to a hard mattress and am sure glad I did. My bed is so comfortable now!
5,Great when you cant afford to replace your mattress.,"I bought this item after many nights of waking up with back pain. At this time I could not afford to purchase a new mattress but needed some sort of relief. This has been the best thing I could have ever done. My back feels great and I can wait another year or so on a new mattress. People have complained about the smell in the reviews. I did not have any issues with this. It did not bother me at all. The mint chocolate chip smell basically is spot on. This pad stays on the bed very well and makes for a wonderful night sleep. Is this a end all to needing to replace a mattress in the future no, but as a short term fix until the funds become available it is a great purchase."
5,FEELS like a new BED!,"I put this on the bed and sleep like never before, it feels like a new bed with 1/4 the cost. Great buy."
4,comfortable,"I am very happy with this memory topper. The bed is much more comfortable, and I sleep much better:)"
5,Excellent!,"I can't believe how nice this is for the money. I added this to an 11 year old Simmons Beautyrest pillow top that has seen better days but I don't want to spend the money on a new one. As far as I am concerned that problem is solved now that I bought this. On sale at ~$75, I can't believe how nice this is. My tossing and turning is greatly reduced and when I do move around, I don't shake the bed for my wife with this added on. We live in the hot desert southwest so I was worried about the foam making for hotter sleeping. As I write this it is the peak of summer and if anything this thing makes the bed cooler as it has little holes all through it that must help dissipate the body heat. I am thinking about buying another one to put in the closet in case this one gets compressed over time and I can't find another one then."
5,Great buy! Turned cheap camper mattress into very comfortable bed.,This foam mattress topper is a Great buy! It turned our cheap camper mattress into very comfortable bed. We bought this about a year ago and now are going to buy a king size to cut into two for our kids beds in the camper. This foam has a great feel to it and holds up well. I sleep great on it.
5,Elderly comfort,I purchased this topper for my 88 mother who is in an assisted living facility. She could not lie in certain positions due to pain. She loves this topper because she no longer has to sleep in one position all night. I did not find any odor with it.
2,Overprice non-memory foam mattress topper,"I was very disappointed in this mattress topper. I was so excited to get this. I tried it for one week but my sleep was so terrible that I decided to return it. Like the other reviewers said, it's not very memory-foam-ish. It doesn't spring back up when you put your hand on it. It's just a bit denser than a regular egg-carton foam topper. I wanted some extra padding on my futon mattress because I was starting to feel a hint of the metal bars on my bed frame. However, I could still feel the metal bars even after I put the topper on! I was better off just buying a quilt on sale for less money but provided better padding than the topper. I was fine with the minty smell - it made me think of mint chocolate chip ice cream which I bought later that week.ps - I do not weigh that much and my futon mattress is not the thin cheapy Walmart/Target type so my bed issues were not like I had a total crap problem and expected the product to work miracles."
4,Pleasant :),"Product arrived promptly. Did not take long to retain appropriate form (didn't need 24 hours to 'fluff'). Strong minty odor is present. Needs longer than 24 hours to 'breath' the topper of the mint odor. Smells pleasant at first, but could be a little strong to sleep on nightly. Extremely soft and does job well done for hard mattresses. On a personal note, its a tick too soft for my preference, but overall is pleasant to sleep on."
1,wrong size or wrong foam dencity?,Received item was marked as quenn size on the box but it was 5lbs lighter than the sizing table on the plastic packaging cover. The awfull smell was there after 48 hours. It sent back.
5,Just as expected:),"The memory foam mattress has definitely helped me sleep better at night. I decided to buy one after looking at new mattresses and refusing to pay $400-600 for a (cheap) mattress set. Instead I bought a mattress encasement, a memory foam topper, and a used $100 bed set from craiglist. Saved $100s of dollars and have nice comfortable nights. I do agree that it did smell like chocolate mint, but I aired it out a bit before placing it on the bed. But I absolutely love this bed topper!!"
4,great mattress topper!,"I checked out the reviews before ordering this product on Amazon.com and they were quite positive.Ordered two twin mattress toppers. One had a defect and was exchange without a problem. One topper had no bad smell. The replacement had to be aired for a few days in the garage before the smell went away.The size of the toppers fit the mattresses very well. It transformed my mattress into a luxury bed! Hate to get out of bed in the morning, it's so comfortable!"
4,Great topper,"This mattress topper is dense and thick. My bed was just a bit too hard and now it's plush and comfy. The only down side is that the topper is a few inches smaller than the mattress- supposedly its made that way to keep it from bunching up, but it doesn't seem to help. We still have to tug on all the edges to straighten it out every so often or it bunches up in the middle."
4,Sleep Studio 2-Inch Visc02 Memory Foam Mattress Topper,"I read all the reviews on this product BEFORE buying it AFTER I had made the mistake of buying a ""memory foam"" mattress topper from Wal Mart that I HATED. This Sleep Studio 2-Inch Visc02 is a WINNER. I like everything about it EXCEPT it did not come with a cover - it's just the memory foam. That's the only reason I'm rating 4 stars vs 5.To solve this problem I bought a mattress pad cover (from Amazon)that I don't tuck all the way under the mattress -- just put it on top of the foam and tuck all the ""siding"" under the foam. At first I tucked it under the mattress - but that made it too tight and impacted the ability of the foam to work like it is supposed to. Now it all works like a charm."
5,OMG great foam!,"Wow, I love this foam. I have to say I was a little hesitant when buying because I get hot very easily when sleeping. This actually keeps your bed cooler because of the ventilation feature. One more wonderful thing about this foam, my soar back isn't sooo soar anymore. I do still get aches sometimes jsut not as often, but I wouldn't return this if you paid me!"
4,Comfortable with good price,"We are pleased with this mattress topper. I don't know if I'd call it memory foam though. When you first take it out of the package you will notice a distinct chemical smell, which disappears in approximately 2 to 3 weeks. It Has made a positive affect on an ailing back. We purchased the King size and I must say it completely fits from side to side"
5,Awesome for the price,"Just got this yesterday and slept on it overnight. Not a lot to say really. The smell I got was chocolate mint. There is a packing slip that tells you it will go away in 48 hours. It took about 2 hours to expand and I can confirm that though the dimensions listed on amazon are slightly smaller than a queen, this one fits the queen perfectly. For the money, this is an awesome product."
5,Great topper,The memory foam topper was just perfect. Makes the bed much better....I was amazed it came compressed and opened up to such comfort.
3,It's okay but I am bummed,"My husband says that he feels great now when he wakes up. I don't notice any difference at all in my sleep or back pain. I am a bit bummed I spent alot of money on this, but like I said, my husband couldn't be happier."
5,Like sleeping on a cloud!,"I purchased the 2-inch Visc02 mattress topper for a guest sleeper-sofa.Well, it ended up on my bed and I don't intend to part with it, unless I have a guest sleeping over.I absolutely love it!I wake up with considerably less stiffness in the morning,and I highly recommend it for people with back problems.Amazon delivered the mattress topper very promptly and I was pleasantly surprised that the product was actually ""MADE IN THE USA""."
5,Very satisfied after one year,"We've used two of these for a year. One is on a queen bed, another on a double bed. Each bed has a mattress that is extremely, uncomfortably firm. This topper has transformed each mattress into a remarkably comfortable sleeping surface. After one year, the foam is like new. No discoloration, no odor, no loss of density or recovery.We also have a king bed with a Cuddledown down-filled topper. It was purchased years ago for many times the price of these foam toppers. We will probably replace the down topper with the foam - they are more comfortable than the down."
4,comfort plus...,"this mattress topper was just what I needed to add comfort and support to my mattress. However, I needed to cover it with a lofty quilted cotton mattress pad for breathability and air flow so it does not encourage night sweats."
2,not what it used to be! A different product.,"I bought my first mattress topper with the same exact product number on Amazon a couple of years ago. Then I bought another one just recently. These are 2 different products!!! The older one is the same thickness but made of a much denser material, i.e. substantially better. The new one is still not terrible and it became about $20 cheaper."
5,"Great quality, Very glad we bought these!","We bought three Memory Foam mattresses for our three children this Christmas 2008. The children are 11, 13 and 14. The kids are very happy with quality. They all say how comfortable they are.The foam pads did not come with a cover like some do. However I have put the pads underneath a mattress pad and will just clean the mattress pad as necessary."
5,Gave relief to pregnant woman's back,"Since about 6 weeks pregnant my back had been killing me. This is my second child and I was not going to suffer through pregnancy like this. At 16 weeks along I found this mattress pad and proptly ordered the twin sized one for my half of the king sized bed. (my husband is very picky about changes in his sleep.) So I tried it out for the first time last night and slept like a log on it. Best part is, I went to bed with a sore lower back and woke up feeling good as new. I would recommend this to any pregnant woman. The smell did not bug me at all. You practically have to have your nose right on the mattress in order to smell anything."
4,Sleeping heaven,"This pad is perfect. Especially for a hard bed. It allows you to maintain the support you need for a bad back, while, at the same time, provides the cushioning you need for a good nights sleep. I highly recommend this product."
1,NO MEMORY EFFECT!,"I purchased a king size a few months ago and had the memory effect (leaves a imprint for a few seconds) and love it. Decided to purchase a queen size two months later and no memory effect. Requested an exchange, and the replacement has the same memory issue (leaves no imprint - kind of like pushing down on a sponge - just bounces back quick). Tried to contact the manufacture (got the number from Amazon) and the number doesn't work! I figured that maybe they had a bad batch so I request a refund of the second queen size and ordered a King size one thinking it would be the same as the king I purchased a few months ago. The king came and has the same issue. I will be returning that one and maybe look for something somewhere else. Love the product if it would stay the same quality as the 1st one I purchased a few months ago with the memory effect."
5,Absolutely Great on the back and the pocketbook,"This visco elastic is the same as the ones out there going for close to $200.00. It came packaged nicely and the first night on my hospital bed i have at home i can't tell you the pressure it took off my back and the comfort. Being i have 4 herniated discs, 8 pinched nerves and both problems with my si joints among other health issues, the 2 inch was very plush and has yet to lose it's comfort and go down like pillows to. Excellent price and excellent product. I run the QVC Addicts board and have posted about this and so many have ordered and i keep getting excellent feedback from them also."
3,Not bad Memory Foam Topper,"This foam topper is 8 pounds out of the box which puts the density at 3 pounds per cubic food. This is the way one measures the quality of foam toppers. The previous one that I bought from eBay (and am in the process of returning) was a cheap 1.5 pounds per cubic foot which is on the low end. To find the density, multiply the dimensions (e.g. 30x72x2 and divide by 12, 3 times) and then divide the weight by this number. 8 pounds in this case. The high end is around 5 pounds per cubic foot.You will find that sleeping on foams of different densities feels rough;y the same. The difference is in how long they last, the higher the density, the longer they will last.Hopes this helps and sweet dreams."
2,"Too soft, no vents just holes",Very disappointed. Planned on using it on our motorhome bed to replace the 7 year old plain foam topper we have now but it is so soft and with all the holes totally useless. There are no vented areas just holes everywhere punched every couple of square inches or so. We ended up doubling it over and putting in on the bench bed for our daughter.
2,Kind of ok,My bed still feels the same. Doesn't give much support. I think I just need a new bed. This foam doesn't do the trick Maybe need thicker one for more padding.
2,Smell is Overpowering,I've been shopping on amazon for 7 years and this is the first time I've ever written a review. I've used memory foam in the past and have loved them and never had any issues with the smell. When I received the package and opened the box I noticed that it smelled like chocolate mint. At first I thought it wouldn't be too bad but when I put the topper on my bed it became obnoxiously terrible. While the topper was very comfortable I could not get over this smell. I finally had to take the topper off because every time I walked into my room it smelled like moldy chocolate mint. To make matters worse the smell stuck to my brand new Sealy mattress after I took the topper off. Just returned this product. The only reason I gave it a second star was because it was comfortable. Just couldn't get over the smell.Update 10/2Bed still smells like moldy chocolate mint even after the topper has been off for a week.
2,You get what you pay for,"Gave it as a birthday gift for my parents. It feels nice, but it isn't exactly what I was expecting, but I wouldn't say it was a waste of money. If you are looking for a high-end memory foam mattress topper this isn't what you are looking for."
1,Not Memory Foam,This is false advertising. This is not memory foam. This is just a cheap piece of foam that you could buy for $10. Don't be fooled.
1,Soft but just too toxic,"After much shopping, I chose this product based on the positive reviews. I just cannot deal with the smell of this thing. It's been weeks. I've left in out uncovered and it stunk up my entire apartment with a strong chemical smell. After about a week, I put it on the bed hoping that between the mattress cover and the sheets, it would be okay. It still totally stinks. It's a sickening smell I can't really compare to anything else. As far as comfort, it's okay, but what difference does that make if one doesn't get good rest due to the odor. I'm looking into whether or not it's returnable, but either way, I'm getting rid of it."
4,"Good price, good for guest bed",if the person is not a large person this works well. I can see it wearing out fast under everyday use though
2,Good but NOT Memory foam!!,"I bought a cheap mattress and could not sleep at all in that thing. It gave me terrrible back pain so I bought this topper. It really changed mi bed completely. It made a huge difference and I can sleep now. But it is really important to mention that is is NOT a Memory foam. Even though I like it, i was really disappointed that this was not what I bought. It is really bad that they fool people saying in it memory foam."
2,Still smells after 6 months,"We have a more expensive 3"" topper on our bed and bought this for one of our kids who loves ours but hated this one. Part of it was the smell and part of it was comfort. We have had it out in the open for 6 months now and it still gives off a smell. We will be putting on our guest room bed and will report back in a few weeks after it has been used. For now, I recommended going with a higher quality product."
1,Great for first two months... suddenly rock hard,"This was a fantastic mattress for the first two months of ownership but recently it has become rock hard and no longer comfortable. Now if I lay down on one side the entire other lifts up like a standing on a see-saw. This could just be a bad topper, but I can no longer use it on my bed. I would return if I could compress it enough to send it back."
4,Surprised at how good it is...,"I recently bought a firm mattress that was more of a plank than a mattress. I bought this topper to try to salvage the mattress, and the net result was better than I had hoped.My mattress now nicely conforms to my body, and I no longer need a pillow under my legs to position my bad back. Had I the chance to do it over again, I would have:* Ordered a little bit thicker topper (3"" if they have it)* Found a mattress with a little more resilience (density?). The topper compresses quickly when I lay on it. It would be good to have something with a little more support.Overall, nothing major. This was a good purchase"
4,Transfoam Your Bed,"This mattress topper was intended to make an older and cheaper bed more comfortable and it has. It allows your whole body to relax and get a good night's rest which is exactly what I was hoping for in buying this topper.I'd buy another one without hesitation. Good quality and good service.There are two minor downsides though. They're not dealbreakers but noteworthy.First, the foam has a strong oder when you unpack it. After two or three days I made up the bed with it and everything was fine.Second, the topper pad does move a bit on the bed. While sitting up in bed reading it would slide down a bit.Other than those two minor negatives, it's a great deal and makes a big difference in your overall comfort."
5,great foam pad,order a mattress which wound out being a little too firm so ipo returning it and replacing it I ordered this foam pad to go onto. it worked perfectly now my bed is so much more comfortable. it has the quality and performance of the foam pads sold in stores for hundreds of dollars.
1,Junk,"My wife bought this for us to stay at our in-laws. After the first night, I had a pounding migraine. There was an undeniable chemical smell coming from somewhere. Low and behold, it was this stupid mattress pad. We promptly returned it and went without. I would never buy another one of these from this vendor again..."
5,Hot Honey,"I bought this, before asking my sweetheart about it. When he found out he told me I wasted my money- He gets very hot at night and knew this product would make him swelter. The product came and I laughed at the holes drilled as ventilation- he explained that the holes provide more surface area which do keep it cooler.We have slept on the pad for over a month. Last night he admitted that he loved it. It was a great buy. It might not be the memory foam that keeps your hand print, but it is thick, high density foam that keeps pressure points at bay.The smell was not my favorite but dissipated fairly quickly."
4,It fits in the horse trailer.,My intended use for this mattress topper is a little out of the normal use. I have a sleeping area in my gooseneck horse trailer for overnight camping trips with the horses. The California King size fits almost perfectly from side to side and front to back. I already tested it out on a weekend long camping trip. The thickness of this topper makes a very comfortable spot even on top of the metal in the goose neck trailer. Because it fits wall to wall in the gooseneck you won't be able to roll off the side of one of these. My friend had a regular mattress in her trailer and if you toss and turn to much you roll off and get stuck between the sidewall of the trailer and the mattress. So if you are looking for a comfortable pad to put up in your horse trailer for overnight camping I'd recommend this one.
3,Okay- but not great,"I bought this to make my bed more comfortable. I had bought another version without the ventilation for my bunk on a tour bus (a must for all roadies). It helped so much! But this version was not as dense as that one- some reviews talk about giving it time to relax and get to the full size. This one had no problem doing that. The foam is white and not that really dense, yellowy memory foam...but cost as much. I think that it is hotter than the other even though I put this under the mattress pad. So this will go on the guest room bed and I'm ordering the original one that I bought."
2,hot topper,"I bought this for my mother she wanted a mattress topper for her bed.it is very soft and supported. I put it on her bed fits perfectly' but when she sleeps on it it moves off the side of the bed,also it is very hot to sleep on i don't know if it,s the foam or what! she won't use it so be aware. I would not recommend it."
2,Not memory foam,"On a positive side, it is 2 inches thick and fits a queen sized bed perfectly fine as advertized. On the realistic side, it is only made of regular foam, not memory foam as advertized. If there is memory foam in it, it is only a very small percentage. I thought 2 inches would be good to prevent body aches from laying on a firm mattress. However, 2 inches is too thick creating pockets where one lies on the bed. I believe a 1 1/2 inch thick mattress would be better. On the negative side, there is not the cushioning and coming back to regular shape like memory foam. It is a regular foam that creates more of a pocket where you are lying. Through these pockets I am not sure if it is the cause of current back ailments or not. It is still in the testing phase. Personally, I would not purchase this product again."
5,like sleeping on a marshmallow,This topper is much softer than I expected but it is very comfortable. It has really helped me sleep better on the old mattress I placed it on.
4,Rescued my back from a rock hard mattress,"My boyfriend would sleep on a slab of wood if that was acceptable, and the mattress he had when I moved in was not far from it. I would wake up every morning feeling bruised and battered from having my pressure points rammed against its hard surface. Finally, I convinced him to let me try putting this mattress enhancer on the bed. I'd read all the reviews and knew that it likely wouldn't last longer than 6-9 months, but for $90, it seemed well worth the risk of having to replace it a couple times a year. It arrived quickly, didn't have any unpleasant fumes when we opened it, it fit our Queen-sized bed perfectly, under our mattress protector, and turned our torturous mattress into a comfy retreat, not all that distant an experience from sleeping on an actual Tempurpedic mattress. My body aches are gone, and I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,Above average topper,"In the past, I have owned far worse toppers, but at the same time I have owned a few better. I believe I purchased the ones I believe were superior from costco at around 100 dollars, so the price point goes to this product. However, I believe it may be a little too firm for my liking, as the more plush the memory foam the better! On the other hand, it may be that I just ordered a topper that was a bit too thin, and the 3 incher would have been more to my liking. Oh well, it does take a bit of stress off of my back,I was expecting a cover, but after reviewing the product description, I guess that's not actually part of the package, so my bad.Lastly, the product is far more yellow than it appears in the photographs posted here, and it shows through our fitted sheet and makes it look a little bit more ramshackle than I would prefer. If you don't have an aesthetic compulsion for things, then this won't be an issue for you."
4,Sherman...a different man,"I enjoyed this work. Even though it was not an exhaustive report on General Sherman, (as it probably never was intended to be), it was interesting and thought provoking. I especially liked the somewhat fresh ideas on Sherman's treatment of the Carolinas after his well known march to the sea. Not all authors have the poetry and flow of a Carl Sandburg but Mark Coburn has a style that makes this work an enjoyable read as opposed to some that can lose you in details that are not important to the issue. If you can obtain a copy, I would recommend you do so."
1,Damaged Product,When I received my package it was open and damaged. There was hardly any packaging inside to protect the wastebasket. It was a christmas gift and I had to return the item for a refund. I will not ever order again.
2,steelers wastebasket,"Bought it for my son! Looks nice at first, but rusts easily if it gets wet. I used it for my son's bathroom and a few times my son did not put a plastic bag inside of it and I guess it got wet and rusty. Other than that its a nice size wastebasket and colorful!"
2,Not That Great,"I cleaned and assembled target, took to range and shot it, with 22 cal. pistol, with direct hits 3/4 of the targets won't swing over to other side, box says 30 yds. min. for pistols, thats too far, at 30--40 feet they still won't flip to other side , tried WD40, still won't flip when hit with 22."
2,Problems with the first product,"Bought this target a year ago. It worked fine for a couple of months. Adjusting screws loosens up after shooting a couple hundred rounds of .22 rimfire shots. Tried to adjust but the screws that adjust the tension are too short (1/4 of course threads) and eventually all stripped out. Without screws tightening to rod the target is pretty much useless. So, I took it apart and hang the steel pieces from a tree on a wire and that is my new target. I know others with the same problem and don't know why the company doesn't do anything about it. Save your money for a better target. EDIT>>Okay, I wrote the DOALL company and they sent me a replacement and I am now trying it out and will repost if this one is better. For now, I give the company credit that they stand behind their products. Just remember to fill out the warranty papers when you purchase one."
4,"well built, but needs work","The unit is well built and i am very pleased with that point, but even with the spring tension set as low as possible it's still too strong for a. 22 long rifle cartridge. Shot with a rifle and decreased range every few shots until I was within 20ft, that is closer than manufacture considers safe, and targets never full flipped around as designed. I have lubricated the mechanism and made sure nothing was binding. I suspect the wrong springs were installed. I plan to disassemble and remove the springs. I would still recommend this item but plan to work on it."
2,some of the target arms will not swing around the post,I have tried adjusting the spring tension. all are set as softly as possible. I am hoping the arm action will improve with use.
4,I had a few Issues But fixed them and works great!,"Length:: 9:01 MinsI do believe that this is an import item and sold by Do-All Outdoors they do stand behind there products though.I had a few issues and called Do-All. They said they would replace it. I elected to keep it and fix the issues myself.A good tear down, cleaning and greasing did the trick. The secret is that the all the targets need to beable to slide up and down on the D-Shaft freely. If they do not they will bind and will not swing freely. After I did these things thethe target works great and lots of fun.I think it was well worth the money for what little effort I put into it.Good Luck and Safe Shooting."
2,Good start,They had a good idea that just didn't work. The first time I shot my new target some of the internal parts broke. So I had some new ones made got it all back together and it still didn't work right. Some of the flippers don't flip good and get hung up kind of a bummer. Its real heavy built and looks good but that doesn't do much for how it works. May use some of the parts for another target.
5,Also fits Uniden EXI8966,"Bought this battery Jan. 2001, for my Uniden EXI8966. Works beautifully for over a year now. I believe several Radio Shack cordless phones with the handset look like this Uniden, are made by the same manufacturer so this battery should fit those phones as well."
1,wrong battery for the Panasonic KX-TG1000N,In March 2002 I had to send this battery back for credit as this phone requires a two cell battery unit instead of this three cell unit which is too big to fit in the handpiece battery compartment. So far I have found no other source for the correct Panasonic battery except Panasonic.
4,Innovative solution,A good product to solve a problem with dogs..Very pleased and thank you for the help
2,Item Received was NOT what was Listed,"I expected to receive an Innotek ZND-1025 collar as pictured and labeled.Actual product received was a lower quality replacement item (PetSafe RFA-377).Reported as ""Only the name has change, the item remains the same.""But, the nylon webbing is now thinner and of a lower quality, the buckle is now plastic instead of the original metal one.The circuitry in the collar 'receiver pod' seems to have changed. Does not provide audible beep at a certain distance followed by correction charge at a closer distance. Now beep and charge happen at same time and may get stronger and faster as distance to zone decreases.After a couple of emails, the seller agreed to provide refund. I did not pursue this as further investigation revealed I would probably end up getting the 'new' superseding version no matter where I purchased it.Such is the risk of buying things sight unseen from the inter-web. Ho-Hum."
2,it's better than nothing,"I have several of the units stashed around the house. They are somewhat effective. Sure, the dog stays out of the laundry room where the cat's food lives. But, in the kitchen, he understands that if you run and grab, you can avoid most of the shock. so, food that falls off of the counter or quickly getting things off of the counter are effective for him. Also, I am on the third receiver collar. When the batteries go out and are replaced, the collar dies. I have tried resetting it (you do this with the large donut unit) to no avail.I would give it more stars if there were a setting to deliver the whole shock without the ramp up. Beep for 2 seconds and then, BAM. It would be more effective for our superbeagle."
1,Deserves 0 stars,"... this is the worst piece of junk I have ever had. Thought that with the Stanley name and having it professionally installed, it would be quality. Unfortunatly I was wrong. It either sticks, or the handle just turns and turns but never unlatches. I even replaced it, thinking I just got a bad one - both did the same thing. Never again - sorry Stanley, you just went to the bottom of the list.Will look elsewhere for quality - maybe I can find one made in the USA."
3,Weak,"Does the job, we like the lever handle on the inside screen door. Overall, however, the lock is very weak and would be easy to overcome with a little force."
4,Gary Hoyt,"Stanley makes fine products and always stands behind what they sell. Thats why I buy Stanley.Ok, this lockset is good quality. The ""lifespan"" of the brass finish warranting it for lifetime has had to be called three times in the past 6 yrs. The brass on the outside knob goes bad. Other than that its a good lockset. The brass finish on the replacements has come out of China and Mexico."
5,Yo quiero este disco quanto antes...:),"I happened to listen ""Rico suave"" when I was in Florida and I started loving his songs. I am now in Japan and it is almost impossible to buy this CD anymore...it's too late. If someone has this CD and is tired of it, please sell it to me. I want it with all my heart!!!"
4,Excellent advance DBA/developer book for Oracle 8i,I work with many legacy 8i databases on Oracle and this book is excellent reference for more advanced topics. The author has an excellent way of teaching concepts and examples as well.
1,Practical Oracle 8i: Building Efficient Databases,Most of the provided internals informaion can be easily found on Metalink in a greater detail. Anything else - in Oracle manuals.
4,"Classic, but not the definitive...","While a multi CD collection spanning 30 years does sound very promsing, Nonesuch cannot offer all of the best recordings of some of Reich's masterpieces (Music for 18 Musicians or Drumming), and some have been missed out completely (Music for a Large Ensemble), presumably because the piece was not recorded under the Nonesuch label. While the collection is formidable, a listener wanting to hear the best recordings of all the pieces might do better seeking out the older (or longer!) recordings of the pieces."
5,Great Coverage and Durable,"Terrific for those heavy downpour. Artwork is great but coloring is plain yet not dull and dreary. If you like Paris, this will be something you would appreciate. Regardless of likes or dislikes, people will comment as it adds something different than your standard plain umbrellas."
5,Love this Umbrella!,"Love everything about this umbrella. The convenient push-button to open AND close is nice. Keeps you from getting rained on as you're getting into and out of your car. Plus, the black & white Paris image is very pretty!"
2,poor quality print,"poor translation, and the print is difficult to read.do not recommend it. The other publication is much better.Would never buy this again, in fact, would like to send it back to publisher."
5,Works great,We purchased this because my newborn was having trouble sleeping. She always woke up congested and strangled. Since we started using the wedge she hasn't had any problems at all she is 5 months old now.
4,sleepy baby,"This wedge works really great with my little one. I was able to fit it in our packn'play while we waited on her crib. Only downfall is that she will move down or to the side. Although this is not a problem with the product, just thought consumers should know for safety reasons. My little one is able to sleep better in her crib and stroller with this insert."
4,Great in our co-sleeper,I use this under our co-sleeper mattress and it works great. It gives our baby the lift she needs in her crib and it is a safe height.
2,Baby slides off.,"I don't like this product for two reasons. Number one, whenever my baby wiggles or moves he starts to slide down or into an awkward angled position so that eventually he ends up either with just his head on the wedge or he's lying completely perpendicular to where I placed him which defeats the purpose of the product. It needs something additional to help keep baby in place. Second, I don't like vinyl type covers on baby mattresses because they don't allow the baby's skin to breathe and he end's up with his back covered in sweat. This wedge is has a plastic cover and does just that. I returned this."
4,Almost perfect,"This item does exactly what it says, however, I also received the one that has two foam that you zipper together.I would have preferred all in one piece, but I did read the prior review so I knew it was hit or miss in regards to what you got.Our daughter is tube fed and receives an overnight feeding, so she needs to be elevated slightly and this is perfect. The angle could be a bit higher, but this is much less expensive than paying close to $200 for the tucker sling."
2,not really useful,I got this as my baby had reflux. She would slide down even if she moves a little in her sleep. I guess you could just use a hard pillow you have at home instead of wasting money on this.
4,Nice to use under mattress,"I like this universal crib wedge - I use it when my son gets a cold, since he's too young yet for a pillow but could use some propping up when his nose is plugged. I find that it's easier to actually put the wedge under the mattress instead of under the sheet - it stays put better and I don't have to worry about my son feeling the zipper on it. The wedge stays in place nicely and is the perfect width for our standard-sized crib. So much easier to use than trying to prop the mattress at an angle with books!"
1,waste of money,"the sleeping wedge is a waste of money. my 4 month old had an issue with coughing at night. this was recemmended to us as a possible solution. however, the wedge simply made him roll sideways down the crib and was never effective. also, since the foam comes in two pieces and the case for it zips up the seam in the middle, there seemed to be a bit of a gap in the middle of the ""pillow"". this did not work for us and was a waste of money and hope."
2,Look for one piece instead!,"I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store. The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover. The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover. The zipper goes right down the middle, so it can't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck. I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece. If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great!"
2,Two pieces of foam!,"After reading the reviews, I decided to risk it and buy the product. Unfortunately, I got the two pieces of foam with the zippered cover. It was not expensive enough to deal with the hassle of returning it. It is impossible to get the two pieces of foam to line up well and very difficult to get them into the cover. It also does not fit smoothly under the crib sheet. There is a little ""bump"" where the wedge meets the mattress."
2,This is your TV packaging material,You will receive two pieces of thermocol and a zipper bag. You need to stuff these pieces into the bag which will make it a split bed (uneven) for your baby. I believe the reason they send you two pieces is to reduce the cost of transportation. The baby will slide on this piece of junk as well as there are no belts to it.Bottomline: Worthless piece of junk and not worth more than a dollar.
1,Waste of money,"I bought this product due to my childs acid reflux and when I initially put her down she would remain where I placed her. After a few hours of tossing and turning, I would find her pinned against the side of the crib/playpen. She would always roll off. I wouldn't recommend this products because it just doesn't work."
2,Unecessary,"I purchased the wedge to help with my baby's spit-up issues and didn't realize it is supposed to go under the sheet, not under the mattress. The doc's office says they don't really stand behind that since nothing is supposed to be in the crib. Also, my baby had trouble sleeping when I tried it. Not sure if it was just that she wasn't used to it or because of the separation/zipper in the middle of it making her uncomfortable. I tried putting it under the mattress instead and my baby was sideways in the crib from rolling down. I think it raised it too much. I just gave up on it. I would suggest saving the money and trying rolling up towels under the mattress!"
1,Not worth it!,Purchased this item since my daughter has acid reflux and can not sleep laying flat. I was unsure how she would do with it so we just tried it at nap time. Everytime we put her down it wouldn't take her long to slide down and almost into the bumper (she is only a month old). Even if we took the bumper out I am not going to let her slide down and hit her head on the railings. This product is a waste of money!
1,flame retardant foam for baby,"It really upsets me that this product is sold for babies when it is a piece of flame retardant treated foam covered in vinyl. I will keep looking for a different product to use for my baby's crib, and I hope enough people will refuse to buy unsafe products so that manufacturers start providing us with better options."
1,Two piece foam with gap in the middle. NO GOOD,"I should have read the reviews first. Like everyone said, this is a two piece foams, uneven in height, leaving a gap in the middle where the baby head lies. It's cheap, but save your $12 this product is garbage."
2,Not for babies with severe reflux,"Did nothing for our babies with severe reflux, except cause them to scoot down in the crib. Definately not recommended for preemies but even after our babies were over 10 pounds, we found this useless."
1,My 1 mo. old kept sliding off,I got this because my newborn didn't like to sleep on his back and kept spitting up and didn't sleep. The first night I tried this he managed to slide off of it and ended up turned sideways. I stopped using it because I didn't want him to roll on his tummy and not be able to breathe. I think it might be too much of a incline for a 1 mo. old.
4,Great product!,My 2 month old has a lot of breathing issues and I have found that just the slight angle provided by this wedge has relieved a lot of her symptoms without making me worry that she will roll around too much like with some of the larger angled ones. Fits right under the crib sheet and stays in place really well.
3,HoHum,"Mine came in two pieces also, which is fine. Nothing wrong with the product really, but my baby just slides down it through the night. Would benefit from a design upgrade that adds a bump across the bottom to stop sliding."
1,ALMOST KILLED MY BABY!,"I am not exaggerating - this stupid wedge almost killed my 2 month old! We wrap a blanket around the edges of the crib, as the hospital taught us to do, so that it does not move. We did that on the first night using the wedge. To my absolute horror, my baby slid down the wedge and his entire head was trapped underneath the blanket. He was swaddled so could do nothing about it. HE COULD HAVE SUFFOCATED!!! This seemingly innocuous product should be removed from the market. I wanted to help my baby sleep, not kill him. Days later and I am still sick to my stomach over it."
4,"Panasonic ES4026NC shaves close, is quiet","After about a month of shaving with the Panasonic ES4026NC, I consider it a good value.The shaver shaves close and is quiet, which were my most important considerations. I havean angular face with prominent cheek and jaw bones and a pointed chin. Other shavers donot shave as close around my chin and jaw bone structure. I also like the ability to rinsethe shaver clean. The only thing I do not like about the shaver is the bright yellow trim."
5,Excellent shaver for the money,"Bought this one as a backup, I've been using this model for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied with its performance."
4,Great when my son is in a hurry!,"My 16 yr. old son likes to use this when he's un a hurry before school! It's not as close as a razor, but good enough!"
4,Battery Stinks!,"After six months of use, the battery is already shot. Having to replace this shaver twice a year wipes out any cost advantage it may have over other models."
4,wet dry electric razor,"This is my first electric razor ever. I was in dire need of one so I am satisfied with the performance of this newly attained electronic equipment. At the moment I have not used it while wet, but the functions for dry have proven as good as it said it would be. It leaves my skin very clean but I live at a military academy so it behooves me to follow through with a regular bladed razor to get the closest shave ever. either way it helps tremendously being that my faciar hair grows pretty quick."
4,good razor,This is a great little razor. It's the only one I've tried that doesn't tear up my neck. Doesn't work as well wet(for me).
4,Shaver works great,"This shaver does a nice job. It isn't one of the high RPM shavers or triple-floating head shavers in the current generation, but it is just as effective."
4,okay product good price,"used this razor for a year or so. it does a good job for the price. decided to buy another one instead of purchasing replacement blades, for it was just about the same price as of the new razor. for the price it is a good deal. fast shipping and overall a good deal."
2,does not shave well,"I wanted to like this shaver, as I was looking for something different than the traditional Norelco rotary razors. It is well made, sounds like it has a well-built motor, and is submersible.However, this shaver does not give me a good shave; it misses hairs. Maybe this is due to the fine beard I have, but my old Norelco never had that problem. Also, if I have more than a day's growth, this shaver is useless."
3,OK Shaver for $30,"The shaver works great - this makes my 3rd or 4th Panasonic shaver and by far the cheapest one I've owned yet. Other more expensive shavers have had the 3rd row of cutting blades that work on the longer whiskers - this one only has two rows and if you've got more than a day's growth, it has a hard time capturing the stubble. Such was the case Sunday morning trying to shave for church; I had not shaved since Friday morning and I ended up having to use a straight edge to finish the job. If you shave daily (even on the weekends), this shaver will do a great job. As they say, you get what you pay for."
3,Panasonic shaver,"Pros: well contoured grip, comfortable shaving heads, easy rinsable cleaning, bargain price.Cons: misses longer hairs, pop-up trimmer is uncomfortable, awkward charging base."
1,Price is right but razor isn't good,"Pros: price and wet/dry operation.Cons: it doesn't shave well. As others have commented - you have to shave daily for this thing to even have a chance....even then it seems there are hairs that it just won't shave. I either have to go over and over the same area (and sometimes that doesn't work) or pull out another razor to finish the job. This is only the 3rd razor I've owned in 20+ years of shaving and I can't believe how bad it is. The saying ""you get what you pay for"" is true here."
3,Great for the price,"I've had this shaver for over two months now. Being in my early 60's, I've been shaving a long time. Having had many shavers in my life I'd rate this one as a ""good"" shaver. I've had other panasonic shavers that did work better, BUT cost much-much more. For me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price."
1,Barely Usable,I read some reviews on how great this was and felt pretty good about the purchase. It turned out to be barely usable and time consuming to get even close to a decent shave.I would say that those who liked it must have just a little peach fuzz or something. It took about 15 minutes to shave my face and it still left behind long whiskers and missed patches. Don't waste your time with this one and get something better.
1,Doesn't charge up,"My Panasonic wet/dry ES4026NC has never charged for me. I've never been able to shave with it. When I called the service center I was instructed to send it to Texas to subsequently receive a reconditioned model. I've never created a review for any previous Amazon purchase; this is my first.""Dissatisfied in Grand Rapids Michigan"""
1,Cut my husband's face up!,"Do not buy this product! I bought it for my husband for Christmas and the first time he used it, it cut his face up all over and his face burned with razor burn for 2 days and is still hurting.At first, it didn't cut any hairs at all, so he tried to push it a little firmer on his skin and it totally tore into his skin. He looks like he was attacked by a bear."
2,"No Good, Misses a lot, You get what you Pay for","The worst shaver I have ever used, but I guess you get what you pay for. I bought this when it was on sale for $20 and was not impressed at all. The shaver misses a lot of hairs and does not cut close at all. I read that it takes some time to get used to the shaver but after over a month no change. I never tried the shaver wet because to me you might as well use a traditional blade razor. Stay away from this model and consider something a little more expensive, it is worth it in the long run."
2,Useless,This shaver does not work! Since my father is not able to shave the responsibility falls to me or my brother. We thought electric would be the way to go to avoid accidents with blades but we are back to using disposable shavers with much more success. We have tried on multiple occasions to use this shaver without removing any hair so we have given up. Not much to say on the positive side to balance this out since it simply does not work.
1,Not a good buy,"I ordered this shaver for my husband.He wanted something for a wet and dry shave.I don't know much about shavers, but his dislike of this shaver was bad!!!It may work for some ,but not for him."
2,Poor performance,"Pros: Can use in the shower with shaving cream, easy to cleanCons: Battery runs out after 6 shaves (this was a brand new unit). It does well with flat areas i.e., moustache, chin, and cheeks, but fails around the neck (my co-workers thought I was going for a European look). I have to go over my neck area several times, often irritating or nicking the skin. I thought using shaving cream would help, but it actually makes the blades slip. Despite my best efforts from all angles, this shaver still leaves significant stubble and missed hairs. My $2 schick razor does a better job! I have another more expensive panasonic shaver and it has the same problem. If you're looking for left-over stubble, go for this shaver. If you want a closer shave, look elsewhere, if not, for another brand."
1,doesn't work at all,this shaver is not worth a penny. for one thing it does not work unless you have a fine stubble and another you can't use it sometimes because it is cordless and is on the charger. such a crummy device over all
1,crappiest electric razor i have ever owned,do not buy this unless u like throwing away money. i should have listened to the other bad reviews
4,amazon adventure,"I found it very easy to make a selection for the item I wanted and was extremely satisfied with the way my purchase was handled, especially in being informed several times of the stage the process was at. I have since returned to amazon for another purchase.I found it very convenient to just deal with Amazon and not the seller."
1,This Item SUCKS!!!!! I give it a Zero!!!,The only thing that happened with this electric razor was I got razor burn on my neck. No hair was cut at all!!!
2,Just not good..,"It is rechargeable and it works wet or dry. Thus the two stars... but the accolades end there. I don't have thick hair growth and yet I still have to go over my face many, many times to get all the hair cut. It does patchy work and is not smooth. Its cheap, yes, but when you have to run it over your face many times and end up sore because of it then the cheap isn't worthwhile any longer. Look elsewhere and save yourself the frustration."
3,Its Ok,"I bought this for my 17 year old son who just started shaving and only has some peach fuzz, but he said it dosen't work that great. Maybe its meant for more mature whiskers, not sure."
2,disappointed,"I purchased the shaver because of the high rating it got in consumer reports. I am no mountain man with a thick beard. But this shaver just doesn't have enough power to do the job. I find myself having to shave 2X a day. If I let it go a full day, it can't shave the hairs. If I miss a day, I have to shave with a razor (or my old Remington shaver)."
1,Not so great,"I don't know if this is an issue with this particular product or with electric shavers in general, but it does a bad job if you have slightly longer hair. It works OK if you have smaller hair. I wouldn't bother wasting your money on it. Best thing to do is find a buddy who has an electric shaver and see if he'll let you test it out. If you like how it works on your face you can buy one just like it. Otherwise, stick with regular razors."
2,Didn't give me a good shave,"I purchased this razor on the strength of a positive Consumer Reports rating and many good comments from Amazon reviewers. My own experience was not so good. Even after going over my face numerous times, the razor left many whiskers untouched. It was especially unsatisfactory around the lips. But even on smooth expanses, such as my neck and cheeks, the Panasonic missed many hairs."
2,Very poor performance,It is very hard to get a decent cut with this machine.The feature wet/dry is ok .... but the cut ... is really really poor.I wouldnt recommend this product.Hernan Rodriguez.
2,Not up to the hype,"I got this as a gold box deal and for $20, it is ok. It does my cheeks fine. It doesn't do my neck at all and only does the chin mediocre. I mostly use it dry and had an even more difficult time using it wet. I've had to redo my neck with my Mach 3 frequently. It's good on light, non-course hair that isn't too long."
5,What I was missing,"'I was introduced to this razor by a friend in Dallas about 20 years ago. I was so shocked how close it shaved that I went out and bought one. Since that time I have used 2 more eventually wearing them out. After the last one I tried 2 different razors at a discount and they were so pourin their comfort and performance I immediately ordered another Panasonic (upgraded) from Amazon for about $22.00.If you are questioning your first venture into electric razors or you are a veteran, this razor shaves closer than a blade. Let me repeat, IT SHAVES CLOSER THAN A BLADE, IT IS SILKY COMFORTABLE, IT HAS A USEABLE TRIMMER, IT CAN BE USED WHILE BATHING,IT HAS LONG BATTERY LIFE, AND IT IS VERY REASONABLY PRICED.In fact I have just ordered 3 more for gifts.And, no I do not work for Panasonic or Amazon or a dealer, IT IS THAT EXCITING A PRODUCT, you want to share it..Red Bernard"
2,Poor function and quality,"The unit is rated for wet or dry use, but beware. The charger hole in the bottom is NOT waterproof. This means you can use it with shaving cream or gel, and rinse the head, but don't take it into the shower and let it get rained upon, and definitely don't immerse it in water.Beyond that, I found that the unit really does not give a good shave. If I hit the edge of my mustache, the unit will tug or pull hairs as it strains. When staying clean-shaven, this will not get any closer than ""5 O'Clock Shadow"". As in, if I use a 3-blade disposable, then use the Panasonic at end of day, the Panasonic won't get any closer. I've tried gel, cream, and dry. I've tried going different directions, different angles, etc. There's just too much internal gap between the blades and the foil to get even a vaguely close shave with this.As such, I can't really recommend this. I mean, the price is good, but it just doesn't do what it's designed to do."
2,not happy,"I have read alot of review on this item so i decided to purchase it.I bought it in may 2010 and since i have recieve it i only used it twice because i am very disappointed. my problem is i dont get clean shave as the reviews state,when i used it some area of my face is clean while other ares still have hair.i am not happy and the only reason i dont return it is because of the distance i am.Very disappointed user"
1,Worst Shaver Ever!,"I bought this Panasonic shaver based on the reviews on Amazon and was greatly disappointed.I tried it as a standard dry shaver and it kept missing hairs. I tried it as a wet shaver and I tried it with shaving cream but still got poor results. I ending up buying another shaver 2 weeks after buying the Panasonic because it was so bad.Now, after having it less than a year, the shaver will not charge and I have to throw it away at an electronic waste center.Do not waste you're money on this piece of junk."
1,Don't buy,Doesn't shave properly. Leaves clumps of stubble on face. Have to work real hard to get a shave at all. Understandable why it is so cheap.
1,crap,Stay away from this if you do not want to have rash on your face.I am not sure how come this has 4 star review rating.
2,Depends on your beard hair.,Pros. Ergonomic design. Quite operation. Easy clean up with soap and water.Cons. No cord for shaving when the battery is dead. Inadequate performance for long bear growth or course beard hair.If you shave daily and don't have course beard hair this shaver will likely be a keeper.
4,Panasonic ES4026MC Shaver,"Best shaver to get at such a low price! The design of this shaver is extremely functional with an ideal cutting area that's easy to maneuver around your face whether you're trimming a beard, shaving around a beard, or just shaving your entire face. Easy and comfortable to hold, the shaver holds a charge very well, is quiet, and shaves nice and close. The Panasonic line offers the option of a wet shave, including shaving with a foam or gel. I've found you get the most lubrication and closest shave using a gel such as Edge, but a dry shave is almost as close and smooth.The pop-up edge trimmer works well and is easy to use. The charger base is about the size of a wall adapter, plugs directly into the outlet, and the shaver sits directly on top of the charger, so it's best used in the top outlet of a receptacle.I think you'll be very happy with the choice of this shaver. The price and quality can't be beat!"
4,Good for the price,"The shaving quality can not compete with my previous Braun shaver unless you use some shaving gel. I got it for under $15; so, excellent value. The only disappointing part is that it can not be used corded; once no battery charge, you are stuck!"
4,Like the option wet/dry,"The shaving head is a little smaller than my previous razor, but the wet/dry option is great."
1,Not for Everyone,"My Remington rotary shavers are a few years old so I thought I'd try something new. I've used foil type electrics before and not been happy. This was the worst. If you don't shave every day this is not the shaver for you in as it has difficulty with longer stubble. Also if you are used to any kind of rotary, you will probably find this very awkward to handle by comparison. My 5 year old Reminton gives a far closer shave."
3,Fair,"Ok/ inexpensive ,charges quickly seems to work better wet with soap .I found it will not cut softer hair, ok on a corse beard.For under $30 its worth a try with alot of shavers for well over $200 you can buy alot of thease to try out."
2,Feels cheap,Bought this to replace my Braun shaver after I lost the charger. Feels cheap. It is very quiet but I guess that also makes me feel like it is not doing the job. Any hairs longer than a day or two growth does not get touched. Just not doing the trick for me. Wish I would have stuck with the Braun brand.
4,OK its good!,"My first wet/dry shaver, would give it a 5 stars report but the8 hour charge is a little bothersome. Plan ahead for a full batteryand you are good to go. Amazon, delivery was perfect!"
4,Panasonic shaver is a good buy.,"This is a good shaver. It's relatively quiet, fits the hand well, cuts close, and is easy to clean. The wet/dry feature means it can be used in the shower if desired. Recharge time is 8 hours for a full charge but enough of a partial charge to get one more shave out of it takes much less time. I like everything about it except the yellow color. I recommend it."
3,"Worth the price, but go for a better shaver.","This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well. There's always some beard left. and the trimmer is just literally a trimmer! But it worth the price I paid for it (35$)."
1,Bad product,"This product came very adorable, working very well but for less than two months. It just stopped working and I couldn't understand why."
1,Not Dad's Favorite Shaver,I purchased this shaver for Dad. He used a while and complained that it did a poor job. i returned it to the company.
3,electric shaver,"Bought it for my dad, who is 91. He did not feel it gives a close shave, but then he IS measuring it up against the memory of a good barber shave with a straight razor..... I can't be fair in rating it, as I don't use it. Though he grumbles, he uses it, and he looks pretty good to me....Personally, I think it's well worth the price."
3,Best for thin or fine facial hair.,"I should've known ""you get what you pay for"" when I purchased this shaver. I have an older Panasonic that cost closer to 100 bucks. It's lasted quite a long time and maintained solid performance overall. The ES4026 looks and feels like a shaver better suited for a 17 year old with new facial hair to cut on. I have thick, coarse facial hair and this shaver just didn't do the job - I could tell from the first cut that it wasn't for me.Overall, not a bad shaver but I'll keep it in mind for my son to use when he turns 16.....it's definitely not one to use for the seasoned face."
2,Didnt shave any hairs,"I was a little upset about the product because consumer reports gave it such good reviews. I am not sure if it was my type of beard or what, but it didnt shave anything. Mayne it works with other hair types, but definately not coarse hair."
2,Terrible shave,"I hadn't used an electric razor for over twenty years so I thought maybe technology has improved and I would give this one a try, what a mistake!First the positive: It is inexpensive. It is fairly lightweight, easy to hold and charges quickly. The trimmer piece works sort of.Now the bad: This thing leaves hair all over my face! Not long hairs but a lot of tiny short hairs that won't cut no matter how many times I go over it, and over it and over it.I tried it dry and I tried it wet. With shaving cream and without. No matter what I tried those small hairs just won't get cut!This is the last electric razor I will ever try. I will stick to the Gillette Mach 3."
1,This didn't remove any hair whatsoever,"I bought this for my teenage son for Christmas. His facial hair is baby fine so I thought this would be a perfect razor to start with. Plus, the pricepoint was great.The razor didn't take any hair off of his face. We then tried it on my husband and it didn't work on him either.I'm returning and will get him a different razor. In this instance, you get what you pay for."
2,Not sure it's worth the money since it works so poorly!,"I've had this for about three weeks now. I realize that it takes some time to ""train"" a new razor but this is getting ridiculous! Sorry that I chose this one..."
1,Doesn't shave anything,"This electric razor does not shave anything, it just makes a lot of noise. I sent it back the same day I received it.You get what you pay for, and this is a cheap razor."
1,Overrated,"The timmer gets clogged easily and the battery life is miserable, unless it's just me not knowing how to probably charge machinery..."
4,"Good, inexpensive shave","This is the 3rd ES4026NC Panasonic shaver I've bought in 3 years. Not because they break, but because at this price, it's more economical to replace the entire shaver than it is to buy replacement blades. It provides a comfortable shave, and does a good job, providing you don't let your beard grow longer than about 2 or 3 days. I'll continue to buy them every year until they are no longer available."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","For an inexpensive razor, it's not bad. I have been using it for about a month now and I have noticed that I frequently have whiskers that have been completely missed by the razor. There are sections that do get a close shave, but the neckline is difficult and I feel like it takes a long time to get a good clean shave."
4,Decent product for the price,"Not the best razor, but the battery holds its charge, gets the job done, and isn't too expensive. Decent product."
2,Not a Winner,Shaving capability / closeness of shave - 2 starsShaver motor/power - 2 starsConvenience - 1 starThis shaver has a wall receptacle type of charger (no cord)making it impossible to shave with a cord. The shaver died after seven months.
3,Good for the price but...,"It would be even better if it had one of these two features:Battery indicator lightofCorded power chargerThis is my 3rd Panasonic electric shaver. They are usually great at performing their main task (shaving) but if you are not careful, you may be surprised running out of battery before you are done shaving. Having a corded power adapter (like Braun) or a simple LED battery indicator would make this a perfect product."
3,got what you paid for..pretty good i guess,"for what i paid for it, it does the job decently. i have to use the trimmer on my hard-to-reach neck hairs thought, at first that was annoying, but ive gotten use to it. ..i also wish it had a cord..its pretty good i guess"
3,razor evaluation,Has nice features and works fine as long as you haven't let your whiskers grow too long. The flip up feature is too small to do any amount of long whisker shaving and the main doesn't do the job very well on longer growth.
3,Not the quality I expected,"After using a Panasonic linear razor for years I thought any Panasonic product would be just as good. WRONG!!! Although the ES4026NC is ok, it dosen't shave as good as my old one. It misses hairs and takes twice the time to shave as my old one taking the Linear out of their line was a big mistake..."
1,panasonic shaver,Takes 3 times as long to shave compared to my old one. Takes forever to get hair into the screen and for it to actually cut it. Go to the store and buy one then you can return it easily.
2,If you have a thick beard...forget it.,"I picked this up right before Christmas on sale. While I'm sure it's a capable razor for some men, if your beard is particularly thick, look elsewhere. Even after just a few days of growth, I found it unable to shave my beard sufficiently. The way I see it, when I have to go over my face with a regular razor after I've used an electric razor, the razor become unnecessary. For people with thin/regular beards or more moderate growth who shave every single day (twice?), the Pro Curve would probably do a serviceable job, but it's not a good match for me. It gets points for being usable in the shower, good battery life and having a pretty decent trimmer, but even at that it barely musters a two-star rating."
4,Like it a lot - works good; great value; few weakness; return buyer,"I like this shaver - works pretty good; comfortable; great value (at about $30-$35). I bought one and after a year or two it failed after water got into case (I use it in the shower). Disappointing, but still I liked it enough to buy another. Hopefully it will last a bit longer. Works best for whiskers on face & cheeks; some shortcomings on neck. I sometimes back it up with a Norelco triple-header."
5,Cheap and Solid-My type of product,"I bought the previous model (ES4026) about 5 years ago when I just started shaving and it was a great razor. I'm not a very hairy guy, so I can't talk for those who are, but it gave me a great a shave. Someone decided be weird and steal it from work, so I bought this one a couple of months ago. After using this one, I realize the blade on my old one dulled out a bit. Just like the last one, I'm extremely happy with this one. It works great on my face and chest. I usually use the trimmer to get the big hairs and the buzzer to get close. As far as cleaning, the top pops right off and it can be rinsed for an easy clean. I use it about every other day and charge it once every 3 or 4 days for an hour. It's definitely a perfect purchase if you're new to shaving or an occasional shaver and you don't want to spend much money."
3,Disappointing,"Bought this product because of positive review on Consumer Reports and the Panasonic brand (love their electronic items!). Wanted a shaver that would give a close, smooth shave and that could be rinsed off for cleaning. Summary: lightweight, smooth shaving heads and fairly easy to rinse clean, but the negative is that it simply doesn't provide a close shave. After several weeks of usage, it always left much more stubble than my former Norelco or current Braun models (those aren't wet/dry). This was evident shaving either dry or with lather/wet. Most disappointed given the Panasonic name & history, product was returned for refund--hoping no glitches on that with Amazon."
3,It's ok,"The product is fine, but doesn't get as close as I would like, but that may just be typical of electric shavers."
4,Decent performance at a low price,"This shaver is a great value at the sale price. Maybe not so great at list price.My beard is coarse and wiry, with medium thickness and with 2 days growth this unit gave a comfortable if not super close shave (I use it dry). But I have yet to find an electric that shaves as close as a blade. It does require several passes to get all of the hairs so the 3 minute shave time turns into about 5 or 6 which eats into the already short battery life.I have not experienced any of the tearing or cutting that some reviewers describe. In fact, this unit is one of the more comfortable electrics I have used compared to more expensive Norelco rotary, Braun and older Panasonic models."
4,"great shave, don't like the charger.","I had been using the norelco ""cool-skin"" w/d razor, but rotary heads don't work well for me. With this Panasonic, I shaved with a blade on Sunday and used the es4026nc to stay nice and smooth all week with NO razor burn. I'm going to get my girl a ladies model for her legs and underarms.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001209OO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
4,Can't beat it for the price,Unit works well. Charge lasts about a week. Pleased with results. A very attractive price tag.
4,Good product and value,This is the 2nd one I own. The shaver is decent and a great buy for the money. Great for travel as it's pretty small and easy to stowe. Wet/dry option is nice as well.
4,Value for money,"I am very satisfied with the quality of this shaver. I have tried it both wet and dry, and I prefer dry. It works better for me. What I like the most is how easy it is to clean and the fact that it's water-proof. Very good ergonomics. Overall, good value for money, as one would expect from Panasonic."
1,Passable Electric Razor,"This razor is ok for a 1 day growth of beard, but with 2-3 days of growth the razor does not cut very well..I will keep it handy for short trips or for an emergency trim.."
3,You Get What You Pay For,Doesn't shave as close as a Norelco rotary-head shaver. Doesn't work well as a wet shaver; the foil screen becomes clogged with shaving cream. Might be a good shaver for beginners with soft beards but not for those who have shaved for years and have tough beards. I will probably use this shaver only when I travel.
3,Great for everyday shaving,"This shaver is a good value and adequate for general use. I can't seem to get that close a shave below my jaw-line, but otherwise it works well. I would also caution you to not go too long between shaves, otherwise it will hurt. All in all, a good product for my needs, but I could see how a more expensive shaver might be worth it."
4,Awsome razor,"Believe all tho positive reviews, this razor is excellent as a wet shaver. I used it in the shower as instructed, shaving half my face with the panasonic and tho other with a 4 blade razor. Excellent result for my face not being use to the electric shave. Upper lip was closer then the blade! Impressive, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was at the neck it wasn't as close as the blade, it just took a little extra work. I have owned Norelco's and the best Brauns but this Panasonic delivers a far superior shave for literaly 1/10 the price. Great razor! I think I'll buy another in case they discontinue it."
3,Works okay but the charging base plugs into wall,"Shaves okay. There is no charging cord. Instead, the charger plugs into an outlet and the shaver must be inserted into charger. Might be a little challenging for some. Make sure your bathroom electrical outlet is vertically oriented."
2,Hard to get a close shave,"This shaver misses a lot of hairs on each pass, so you must go over each area several times. Even then, the shave is not very close. As a comparison, my Braun travel shaver cuts closer and quicker. The problem may just be the size and shape of the foil holes. Hard to complain too much as I paid only $30, but I wouldn't recommend it. It is adequate as a back up shaver only, perhaps for your gym bag."
1,Neck Cutter,I bought this for my boyfriend and the first time he tried to use it he got two huge nicks in his neck. He complains that its slow to shave with and hurts. He keeps trying to use it though. Last time he only got a small nick. A very disappointing buy.
5,Panasonic ES4026 Rechargable Wet/Dry Shaver,"What a terrific shaver! I used a blade razor for years and switched to an electric dry shaver about 15 years ago because my face just couldn't take the burning and abrasion of the razor blade, sometimes having to shave twice a day. I purchased my Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver after reading the reviews, and I'm certainly pleased with it. I use it wet and it gives me a faster shave than my old electric shaver and afterward my face feels as smooth as it did when I used a blade razor -- only no razor burn. After a few shaves, I was so pleased, that I ordered another Panasonic ES4026NC for my son, who has a heavier beard than mine, and has never found a dry electric shaver adequate for his beard."
3,"good, but short battery life.",This electric shaver does a decent job and quit burning my skin after about 2 weeks. The electric motor sounds run down after only a few shaves and I would recommend leaving it plugged in after use.
1,Works great...for 2 months...,"This razor (Panasonic ES4026NC) was the best electric razor I ever had... when it was new. It was light, quiet, easy to clean, held a charge for 5 days, and shaved quickly through a weekend's worth of beard. It was better than my $100 Braun. Plus, it was $20 after the $10 mail in rebate.After just two months, though, the cutting capabilities greatly diminished. It made cutting/grinding noises, but needed multiple passes, where I had to push down to get it to shave. As everyone knows, multiple passes and pushing lead to skin irritation. It feels like the cutter is not as flush to the microscreen as it used to be. I tried reinserting the blades, but no difference. Also, the batteries are just NiCads (to keep the cost down). Now, after 4 months, they barely hold 2 days worth of a charge.Overall: just skip this one. It's more of an 8 week disposable razor than a long term morning friend."
1,Hurts too much,The shaver seems to have problems. It seems to pull hairs and hurts. I would not recommend unfortunately. Philips Norelco SensoTouch was far superior in its ability to cut close and feel comfortable. Recharging was easier before too with Norelco.
2,Meh,"This Shaver sucks. Did not do a good job on my face. Barely cut my hair. I guess it works in the shower, but then again... it doesn't really work."
2,One of the worst shaver,"I have bought two of these for me and as gift. After using one for couple of days, returned the second one. Not good even for every day shave."
2,All right as a standby,It's light and inexpensive. Not too good doing your beard. Good as a spare or for travel but I'm not sure if it can be charged on 220-volt outlet. It is not marked on the charging base.
2,This Is Not A Great Razor.,"The manafacturer tells the consumer to wait several weeks to become accustomed to this razor, however the blades of this shaver tore up my neck and I was very uncomfortable until I stopped using the razor."
2,Do not waste your money,"I've been using foil shavers for about 20 years and have used Braun & Panasonic exclusively. This Panasonic shaver is the worst foil shaver I've ever used, I can't get a close shave using it wet or dry. Complete waste of money."
1,Not For Me!,"This razor is the worse one I have ever owned, (ES4026 Panasonic). I also had an el cheapo Panasonic prior to this one. It worked ok for a while, but wore out also. Anyway, I am trying another brand now. (Another el cheapo but it cannot be ny worse than this one) for sure. Branded"
4,inflatable hangers...,"I like these hangers because when I dry a blouse or light weight sweater and put them on these hangers, they dry faster! Eventually they wear out and then I send off for more.I also take one or two on vacation, too!I do like dealing and ordering with Amazon.com. Thanks!"
3,Not Happy,"Ordered two four-pack each of inflatable hangers, for a total of 8. Received two two-pack eachof inflatable hangers, for a total of 4. Upon receiving item, sent notice to company, who advertised response time of 24 hours, haven't heard from them, and it's been almost a month. Not worth the hassle of returning. Don't order much via internet. I've learned my lesson...buyer beware. In the future, if I can't personally purchase an item in a store, I'll do without."
4,Can't wait to use on my trip,"Can't give 5 stars until after used a few a times. The hangers arrived in a timely manner and in good condition as advertised.You receive 2 packs with 2 hangers inside. I immediately blew each up and then let the air out. Both was very easy and they deflated, flatten and folded just as they were sent to me. My trip is not for a couple of months and my main worry is to pack them inside some cushioning so they don't get punctured while packed.Will try to remember to update after my month long trip to Italy and France."
1,Watch out for shipping charges!,"I've just ordered and when I reviewed the confirmation email from Amazon, found that the shipping charge for 5 packages is almost $25.00. The price for each package is low, but shipping and handling make these a bad value. Look elsewhere."
4,Okay,"Inflatable hangers are great if you need to dry items- faster- because they hold the front and back apart and allow more air to circulate which is great for a shorter trip, but there are other hangers out there, which I found later that have a little more versatility. They are still inflatable, obviously, but they also have a ""pants"" rod on them which could be used for a number of things that you couldn't hang like a shirt and it has a couple of hooks to hang more delicate, or spaghetti strap type shirts (or maybe even scarves or belts or jewelry if you just want to keep it from getting tangled (not really to dry)?? These would also be good for everyday for items like sweaters to help them hold their form (no hanger nipples)."
2,sharp seams on the upper side,"My mother always had inflatable hangers for button-ups and other pieces of clothing that would have their shape ruined by an ordinary hanger. Now, these hangers don't marker themselves by this value, but by speed of drying, which I guess they help with. However, they have a really sharp seam on the upside, on the shoulders of the shirt (rather than on the lower end of the hanger), that takes away and shape-holding characteristics. I'll try another brand next time."
2,Doesn't inflate easily,"Having used blow up hangers for at least 30 years, I find these to be the worst I've ever used. Almost blew my brains out trying to inflate it. Then I had to open the hole with something sharp in order for air to get into the hanger. After doing that I was able to inflate it but with way too much effort (and I have very good lung capacity being a lap swimmer!). The ends never filled enough.There are other brands out there that work much easier."
2,"Great idea, but, they didn't work.",Took these on a curise to use for drying hand washables. The first time I used them the clothes just fell right off. I couldn't get them blown up firm enough. I think they ended up in the trash when we packed to come home.
2,3 out of 4 hangers worked,I bought two sets of two hangers and 3 of the 4 were still sealed inside and couldn't take in air. After poking it with a sharp tool (carefully so I wouldn't puncture the outside of the hanger)it worked OK. Not as good as the one hanger that worked from the beginning. I would have returned them for an exchange but didn't have time before our trip. When they work - they work very well.
1,Too hard to blow up,I could not get any air into these initially. Yes I know you have to squeeze the valve to get air in. I had to use an air compressor to inflate them but I can't lug a compressor with me when I travel. Took about 5 minutes to deflate.Too much effort.
2,Good idea but needs some improving.,I ordered 2 pkgs of the inflatible hangers. I could not blow them up. We had to use a bicycle pump to get them inflated. I wrote the company and they sent me 12 pkgs (24 hangers). I was shocked. I did find 4 that I could blow up but went through seveal pkgs before I found them. This is a great idea but they need to be easier to blow up. You need some strong lungs. The company was good to deal with especially since they send me so many to try out.
5,"Works Great, Clothes Dry Faster","Used these during a two week trip to Europe with zero problems. I had to hand-wash clothes in my hotel room several times, and these hangers were a big help. The hooks swivel 360 degrees, so it's easy to hang clothes on a closet rod or against an open door. The bulk of the hanger really does improve air flow within the garment and help them dry faster. I'll keep using these now that I'm home. I looked on several travel sites for similar products and this was a good price for a 4-pack."
3,Flimsy but works,"I used these hangers for an extended trip to Turkey and Greece. I used them both onboard a small boat and on hotel balconies. The hangers come in two parts - the inflatable hanger and the detachable hook. Construction is very lightweight which is good for air travel but meant that one of the hangers got a crack in the plastic where the two parts came together and would not stay attached. The inflating idea is good because the front and back of a wet shirt is not next to each other. Air can circulate. However, because they are so lightweight when hung from a balcony or clothesline outside, they tended to fall down. I eventually worked out a method of wrapping my travel elastic clothesline around the hook part of each hanger and getting it to stay in place. I have added photos to the description showing their usage on a windy balcony in Crete."
1,Extremely Difficult to Blow up inflatable hangers.,It is nearly impossible to blow up the hangers and they do not work without inflating them. Nice idea if you could inflate them.
1,Too Silly,"The first 10 minutes of this movie are funny as can be; but then it just falls flat. This movie is along the lines of the Ghost and Mr. Chicken [now that was a funny movie]; but it just doesn't capture the same quality. If I had been watching this in a cinema, I would have walked out. Maybe fun for the young set."
4,AGREST,"VERY NICE EARING, I BOTH FROM RECOMENDATION OF MY FREND, BUT SOME PROBLEMS WAS WITH DELIVERY, ALMOST TOOK A WEEK,FOR EXPRESS DELIVERY COMPANY CHARGE ME $24.99, BUT WAS NOT EXPRESS, AND IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE FOR THAT KIND OF SERVICE."
4,relax - its about the music!,"...The Delgados are truly wonderful composers of music that has many depths and layers. Ironically, they also can sound quite bare.For those who fail to see the connections between, say a Soft Bulletin or a Deserter's songs, might I add that Dave Fridmann produced all three records (buy them all - they're all gggreat or grate as they say in the UK).This Delgado's album is simply a harder edged Bulletin or Mercury Rev album. They are all unique but they share the glorious production of Dave Fridmann.God bless Emma, Alun, Stuart, and Paul and their session musicians for making a remarkable piece of art that will last forever.P.S. Check out their recent album, HATE. It lacks the edge that 'Eastern' has but is beautiful in its own right."
4,Peel was right,"John Peel loved this band (check out the Peel sessions, especially the superb cover of Mr Blue Sky), and you can see why - trippy, visceral and fun. Def worth a listen."
3,Mixed bag on this one,"Kind of a mixed bag here. At times, this disc sounds like a mixture of Billy Idol meets Bang Tango, then some songs remind me of Def Leppard doing 50's Elvis songs. If you like some of the unknown rock bands of the late 80's - early 90's, you may find a few tunes on here you like. Fans of Noisy Mama may like this."
4,Bluesy melodic rock album,"Outlaw Blood was another one of those hair metal bands that came just a bit too late to the party and never managed to gain any commercial success. It's a shame, because there's a lot to like about the band's 1991 self-titled debut.I'd compare Outlaw Blood to bands like Tangier and Tora Tora that added a bluesy swagger to the typical Hollywood hair metal sound. There's also a bit of Bang Tango (minus the funk) and the singer sounds like Billy Idol at times. It's a good mix, and the result is a really solid, really fun melodic rock album. ""Body and Soul,"" ""Red, Hot and Blue"" and ""Hollywood Babylon"" are standout tracks, but the whole album is pretty good.This was the band's only release. Once grunge came in, a band like this didn't stand a chance. It's nothing you haven't heard before, but if you're a fan of the late `80s and early `90s hard rock sound, Outlaw Blood is well worth picking up."
4,Epic Retreats,"After reading ""Epic Retreats"", I wonder what it would take for US Military Leaders to learn that cultures are not domesticated by beating them into submission.It reminds me of the fact that despite the destructive attitude of Alexandre the Great, and his beief that he can cut the Gordian knot Afganistan was not tamed. The Englis failed to domesticate Afganistan and the mighty and rutless Armi of Soviet Union was forced to admitt faliure in their attempt to impose Communist ideology on Afganistan. Are the US Leaders engrosed in their belief that they can convince the tribes of Afganistan that the best form of governing is Capitalism? Can the Gordian knot be cut by any sword?From the Rill to the Ocean: My Journey to Freedom"
4,"Ok, Godzilla 2000 subtitled but.....","I have read and seen that Godzilla 2000 will included the original Japanese verison unlike the old DVD, but what I want to know is if these verisons of vs Space Godzilla, vs Destroyah, vs King Ghidora, and Mortha: Battle for Earth will be in the original Japanese language and also widescreen verisons or will they once again be the dubbed and primarily fullscreen versions from the previous Columbia Tri-Star 2-pack releases?"
1,Don't bother with this if you love Godzilla,"This is probablythe worst set of movies to be put together. Even ""Godzilla vs Megalon"" had MORE HEART and Fun than these rejects. Watch the classics if you can-they are all much better and more family friendly. People used to MTV quality and trash movies though will probably go Ga-GA over these efforts though.Buy the special edition Gojira or english subtitled Japanese language Godzilla movies out or soon to be released instead."
5,godzilla collection 7 pack,it's for my son's birthday. i was so lucky. he'd made a list of movies he wanted and every one of them were in this collection. i couldn't believe it. thanks
5,Spectacular Effort...,"I'm listening to ""Cigarettes and Gasoline"" as I write this and have worked my way down to Track #9 (""When She Loves You""). I truly don't remember the last time I instantly loved a CD from start to finish upon the first listen.I admit...I'm a Tonic fan from all the way back to ""Lemon Parade"", but believe that Emerson recorded three albums with Tonic to prepare creatively (and fiscally) for his career AFTER Tonic.If you're tired of the commercial machine that powers the music industry and the ""music"" it turns out (knowing, of course, that Emerson Hart records for major label Manhattan), buy this album. It sounds like the label believes entirely in Hart and allowed him an ""album"" instead of more ""product.""With songwriting SO far above average, scaled back but creative production techniques, and simply some of the best songs of the last several years, ""Cigarettes and Gasoline"" is an incredible start to an already great musical history.In other words, you won't be disappointed. ;)"
5,One of the best CD's in YEARS,"This has very quickly become one of my favorite CD's...ever. After I loaded this on my mp3 player, I put this in my CD player in the car and haven't taken it out yet. I love the song writing throughout the entire CD. One of the local radio stations has been playing ""If Your Gonna Leave"" which is great to hear that this CD may actually become main stream.I am a fan of TONIC and when I received the email that Cigarettes & Gasoline was released I rushed out to my local retailers (Best Buy, Circuit City, Wal-Mart, and Target) just to NOT find the CD in the store.If you are a fan of TONIC you will love this CD!!!"
5,Astounding Recording! As Good As any Tonic!,A stellar production that proves emerson is the real deal! Ya gotta have this one if you are a tonic fan!
5,"All I can say is, ""WOW""","This is my first purchase of a Vattrina CD. I hesitated because I wasn't too interested in their, what I call, speed singing. However, when I listened to the CD as a whole, Vattrina quiclkly went to the top of my preference list!! What REALLY sold me was the amazingly tight harmony. When those six women break off into their indiviadual harmonies; MAN, that's where their music grabs my spirit and just rattles it beyond belief. Not only is this music folk in origin, there is also quite a bit of the contemporary sounds. Until now, Hedningarna's TRA has been my undisputed favorite. Since hearing this, weeeeeelllll . . . . . .???????? Do you want something a bit different? Ya gotta try it!!!"
5,Folk-pop masterpiece,"This album represents the real shift of Värttinä from relatively strict Finnish folk music to the rock-folk arrangements so popular in Scandinavian music these days. The folk melodies are still there, just as they are with groups like Garmarna and Hedningarna, but underpin a strong drum beat and other electronica. It's actually quite a tasteful first offering in this regard. Even if you don't care for the lengths to which the group went in its most recent offering (Vihma), you'll like Kokko."
2,Very outdated.,This is outdated since it talks about film and developing. The photos are not that outstanding. Good for beginners in photography any hows.
5,A word in Rosenman's defense,"Michelle Kwan fans, I understand your need to warn others that this is not the cd you expected. But for those of you who are just interested in intelligent film music, it really doesn't get any better than this. Here's a man who really understands the needs of a film, what film music should do, and what music should do. Anybody interested in well constructed '50s film scores should pick this up immediately."
2,"Passable, but not memorable","I was so excited while watching a tape of Michelle Kwan skating to ""East of Eden"". I had heard the music for years and could never remember the name. So, when I discovered there was a recording of it, I was enthralled. To my complete disappointment, the CD skips over the most lucid and poignant lines of the melody in favor of a sampling approach. I will probably never listen to the CD again. My only hope is Michelle will keep her program for a while."
2,East of Eden,The album that supposedly has the East of Eden version used by Michelle Kwan is Beastmaster/Spash/Going Home.
2,Where is YAMAHA accessory kit?,"I purchased this product ""Conductor Sterling Silver Plated Flute w/ Deluxe Leather Style Case, 1 Year Warranty and Yamaha Accessory Kit"".I was expecting the Yamaha Accessory kit included somethings like: Tone Hole Cleaners, Pad Papers, Cleaning Gauze / Polishing Cloth / Silver Polish Cloth, and Care and Maintenance Manual.However in the wooden case, there were only the flute, cleaning rod, gloves, and a cloth. I doubted if the gloves/cloth are the ""YAMAHA accessory kit"" because the quality of the gloves is bad. In addition, there is no warranty card."
4,Nice slide,It's a nice slide but be aware that you are buying just one slide not two as pictured. I think they are showing two slides so you get to view different angles.
1,SUCKS!!!!,"This game DOES NOT WORK! When I bought this game it looked really fun, but it doesn't work. I tried it in my sister's laptop, my computer, my family's computer, my g'pas, my uncles, and even my friends computer. I even took the game back 3 times. And NONE of them worked, they all said that a file was missing. And now i cant completely get rid of the game off my computer, there are little file attachments everywhere! Something is wrong with the game, it won't install correctly and when you try to run it, it sais that there is a file missing. And I did try installing it more then once, i tryed at least 7 times. I just waisted my time... So don't waist yours. Do not buy the game, unless you like taking stuff back... (keep your reciept).But if the game does work, its probably the best game ever.... but dont count on it. it prob. wont work.OVERALL: F-"
2,Not As Nasty as they wanted to be-yet.,"I remember this . ""We Want Some p#$$@"" and ""Throw that D"" were quite popular among the college crowd on the east coast in the mid 80s before the jerry-curled jackasses from LA known as NWA brought rap vulgarity to new low depths. Granted, this ain't Beethoven, folks. It could be accurately compared to foulmouthed thirdgraders rapping to the acoustics of the little boys bathroom. But it's good for some lowdown laughter in a Redd Foxx sorta way and not nearly as vicious and hateful as much of the raps that followed."
2,"Yeah, it's dull.","Just listening to the musical clips on Amazon confirms that this album is indeed dull. This continues the trend from their last album, Time Squared, which I found meandering and lackluster. It's a shame. Some of their albums flat out cook, and they are great in concert. Lately, though, the 'Jackets have been luke warm in the studio. Maybe there's nothing of interest left to say.For truly great 'Jackets music, check out their earlier stuff with Mark Russo. Bob Mintzer is a great player, but he seems to have taken the edge off the band. The Jackets are putting out some ""nice"" music these days, but if I want ""nice"" I'll listen to Mozart. If I listen to the Jackets, I want to be floored, not bored. Albums like Politics, The Spin, Four Corners, Samurai Samba - these showcase this talented band at their very best."
4,Great New Stuff from the 'Jackets,"Once again, the Yellowjackets come through with some first ratematerial. They seem to have a unique blend of ""straight-ahead""jazz sensibilities combined with a little fusion and contemporary styles. The musicianship of all of the members of the band is incredible, and the compositional skills of Ferrante,Mintzer and Haslip are excellent as well. The music comes away sounding very ""comfortable"" and well-tuned.I've been a 'Jackets fan for some time now, and have all but one of their CD's, and ""Altered State"" is definitely part of the catalog !!! And, as always, the recording engineering is outstanding, and will definitely bring out the best ( or worst),of your audio system. Enjoy !"
1,I'm a huge Yellowjackets fan but this album is DULL.,"I just got this album today. I'm a huge Yellowjackets fan but I've gotta say that this album is DULL. The writing just isn't inspired. They're all great musicians so the playing is fine. The tunes are bland.Sorry, 'Jackets. Not your best album."
5,"""Dreamery Grieg""","Naxos continues to impress me with their SACD releases. This wonderful pairing of pieces under Engeset and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra with Havard Gimse in the Piano Concerto shines and sparkles from start to finish.Amazing sonics, clear piano lines and vivid ""upfront"" orchestral layerings grace the Piano Concerto. ""In Autumn"" is powerful and clear. The Symphonic Dances is so ""moody"" in composition and receives nuances that compliment Grieg's intentions. This recording has wonderful orchestral balance and top to bottom spatial imaging.Stunning Package!Frank Pandelmusicologist reviews"
2,Decent,"Being a Chopin aficionado and Goode deovtee, I had high expectations for Goode's interpretation of Chopin. Let me first say, Goode is highly underrated -- his playing is top notch. If you get the chance, buy Goode's Bach Partitas. I just recently purchased them and each partita was magnificent. His interpretations are the best I've heard. However, I was disappointed by this disc. His playing was rigid and mechanical, and at times, rushed. Chopin's music is filled with so much emotion, it requires a pianist's poetic interpretation to really bring out that emotion. After listening to this disc, however, I was left feeling cold. The romanticism in those pieces were stripped away. On the other hand, Arrau's interpretations explore those emotions through contemplative and graceful playing. Although slightly pricier, they are the better buy. If instead, you're looking for something cheaper, Idil Biret, has a 15-disc set of all of Chopin's pieces at a great price."
1,Balls,"If you have them you won't need this ,if you haven't got them then you really really need this. This is a book for men who are looking for reasons to explain their lack of thrust and timidity in the world , their lack of courage and creativity. Your mother didn't quite do it to you but it might well be the female of the species who has forgotten her place and her 'difference' who did. Be a man . Don't look to blame or tell any one how they ought to be in the world . I wouldn't allow this messanger to teach me about masculinity unless he can get past his own ambivalence towards women."
1,The album that ruined the band,"I'm amazed at the generous reviews I've seen for this album. Although I'm a fan of the band, this album, along with with their jarring image re-dux, was a career killer. They needed a a great sophomore effort to put them over the top, and God bless 'em - they choked. Rolling Stone gave it 2 1/2 stars at the time, and even Donnie Vie admitted that they were trying way too hard on this one. For fans only."
5,the best,"this album is so strong that you wonder why they weren't more popular. it is solid/dense power pop hair metal with a dreamy sound that needs to be heard to be believed. this album along with their other classic, animals with human intelligence, are 2 of the best melodic rock albums to have in your collection PERIOD. the stunners here are ""mother's eyes"" and ""blue island"". the song ""strength"" is so great as well, a real change on their sound, but still sounding like them. after that, take your pick, there's more winners than not on here, about 3 or 4 to discard. the song ""coming home"" which starts out with a more mellow song, is KILLER. once it kicks in and coming home starts, it is just, well, you need to hear it."
5,Deftones Lover,"Fantastic album, love the depth and range, and simply cannot get enough of this band! If you are new to Deftones, I definitely recommend you purchase this ASAP!!"
2,Poor production value ruined the movie...,"This movie MIGHT have had a great script and great acting, but I'm not actually sure about either. The sound quality of the film was so poor that I could only hear about half of what the actors were saying. Also, the visual production of the film looked like something I could have made with my parents' 1980s camcorder."
2,Another tragic love story... (yawn),"This is another in a long line of tragic gay love stories. These movies always involve some impossibly beautiful young man and his painful awakening to the real world. It's not a very good movie but it's not a very bad movie, it's just kind of there. Another this is don't expect too much character development or plot. The story, such as it is, move forward very slowly and without any real sense of urgency. As far as it being based on the true story of a friend, it's just a bit too much of a cliche for me to really believe.On major problem is the sound quality of the film. I had the volume turned up all the way and still was hearing mumbling and hiss. I love independent films but smaller producers need to remember sound is important. If your audience can't hear the actors, they get bored very quickly."
1,Boring and Pretentious,"This film tries to be an art film. Far too much time is given over to out of focus, lingering shots. The story is told in fragments that leave the viewer trying to piece it together. The end is a complete cliche. I thought gay films had gone beyond suicidal endings. Thoroughly depressing with no compensating features."
2,Could have been,Movie has potential but does not deliver. All the ingriedients are there but the sum total is far less than ithe piecies. I would not recommend thsi as a new purchase to anyone. Okay for rental but definetly not a keeper.
1,Major Disappointment,"With very poor production values, an overly simplified and melodramatic storyline, and an almost complete lack of nuance, this movie was a waste of time and dollars."
1,Don't waste your money,"I didn't expect too much from these as they were cheap, but I figured I'd give them a shot since I had a small screw that had the allen wrench slot stripped/rounded off. Well I drilled the hole out slightly and started with the #1 extracxtor, tspped it in and started turning, no go, it would not grab at all, I tried until the end of the extractor was starting to show signs of rolling the edges over, drilled the hole out a little more and tried #2 same results, so I drilled the screw out and turned out the post that was left by hand once I got the head off. These extractors are way too soft to work, this screw was soft and ruined 2 of the extractors I can't imaging even trying them on a harder screw or bolt. The handle isn't very good either but if the extractors would have bit into the screw I think it would have worked."
1,Broke on first use,I bought this item for the smallest extraction bit and on my fist use the tip of the bit broke off inside ot the bolt I was trying to remove and now I cannot remove the bolt at all. Not to happy with it.
3,Amazon not the glasses,"These are good glasses, really good for the price.But Amazon looses 2 stars because if you get these from anywhere else (and there are LOTs of sites selling them) you get to choose the strength of the reader part of the glasses. Amazon is dropping the ball on these."
3,Somewhere between cool and hot,"Atmospherically inclined, and often laid back at that, Quartet can be as texturally alluring as anything else, but ultimately plays out underwhelming when stacked against even this sole giant's beguiling repertoire"
2,You can do better,"I bought this system a year or so back. I thought it was pretty decent for such a low end system to have optical audio. Anyway, it was never very loud; I had to have it cranked to at least 40 out of 50 to hear anything most of the time. Then the receiver died, so I sent it back and got a new one in return. The sub woofer then stopped working. Recently the surround sound speakers went out too.It wasn't terrible when it wasn't broken, but for the same money or less you can get a better system."
2,Steer clear of this one.,"This stereo sucks. I bought it when it first hit the market at Wal-Mart. That was mistake number one. Mistake number two, was assuming that just because it said it had 720 watts, that it had 720 watts. Ah, no it most certainly does not. I highly recommend saving up and buying a reciever and a power amp, and then adding components. But thats just my opinion, and take it how you want. BUT when spending $160 dollars at Wal-Mart for a stereo, just remember these two things; One: It ALWAYS looks better on the box, and Two: You get what you pay for."
2,Cant even hear it.,"Dont waste your time buying this, the Radio is loud as hell, no problems there, I know it is capable of being loud, but when it is on the TV function, you cant even hear the sound, I thought it would be loud. You can Hear the bass ok, just not loud enough from the speakers."
4,Sounds great,We liked the old 70's look w/the tuner. But need remote to change stations. Keep that in mind. Works well w/ DVD player. For cd's.Speakers give off great sound for being their size.
1,Don't waste your money,"Received this as a gift.I have a tremendous Panasonic system in my livingroom, so I decided to use this in my bedroom.I still cannot get the subwoofer to work.The speaker sound is tinny, and I seriously doubt this has 720 watts of power.The speakers that came with my computer have better sound quality than this system.Save your money and invest in a better quality system."
3,"Calculator is good for it's type, but not the type I ordered.","The TI-92 version of this calculator (which is the one I received) worked okay. I was expecting to receive the plus version, so that rating is reflected upon the regular version of this calculator."
4,Great buy if you can find one cheap,"Now that the vastly superior Voyager is out, this calculator should come down in price (theoretically). While I think it's ergonomically superior to the Voyager, it's tragically lacking in Flash memory (which the Voyager has in spades!).The 92 Plus' ergonomics literally allows you to crunch numbers at speeds that to non-QWERTY users would be unthinkable. Like I said, if you can find this calculator for $80 or less, it's a steal. Otherwise, go Voyager and you will never look back."
2,Not recommended for students,"This calculator is not allowed on any standardized tests, and a lot of teachers will probably not allow you to use it. This calc is only for professionals i would say. Go with the TI-89, it has all the functions and everything that the 92 has, but in a case the size of a TI-83. So you get the same power, but it doesnt look as badass, so your teachers wont get suspicious. and the 89 is allowed on standardized tests. the only thing the 92 has over the 89 is a larger screen, qwerty keyboard (which is why its illegal on tests) and geometry software, which is available to purchase and download for the 89. make a careful choice."
2,TI vs. HP,"I am a mathematics major who has owned several calculators in my life. Of those that I have owned are the TI 92 and the HP 48 (and 49). If you need to do any serious computation then this is not the calculator for you. It is an infix calculator which makes it slow and time-consumng to use. I recomment checking out the HP 48 or HP49 (I prefer the 48). These are RPN calcuators so computation becomes much quicker and you have alot more control over the stack. The one advantage of the TI92 is it's ability to do symbolic manipulation but I prefer do do that by hand anyway, the point of using a calculator or a computer is to get rid of the number crunching, not thinking altogether."
2,Sleeper is a Sleeper!,"I'm sorry, I bought this book because most of the reviews were 4 or 5 star. If you buy this book and expect a lot of action, you may be disappointed. The action generally only lasts two or three pages and is gone for another 50 to 60 pages. I do agree the author was easy to read, but I would often lose interest after 10 - 20 pages. If you would like a similar book which you will not want to put down from start to finish, I recommed Relic or Reliquary, by Child and Preston. Happy Reading!"
4,overriding nature,the use of chemicals to alter development during pregnancy combined with a specific purpose-Whoa! This book is very well done holding your interest from the start . Is the furture now as shown through our past mistakes with introducing drugs such as thalidomide? Action and personal relationships mixed nicely here.
3,Amphibi-man stalks Pentagon,"Good details of Pentagon history, but just not enough real story to sustain any real action or suspense. Interesting backfround used to make the ""monster"" believable, but there was no real tension. There was obviously a good deal of research done for this book.While not a page-turner, it was a very interesting book if you like WWII, history, monsters or combinations thereof.It was a good read, but nothing to write home about."
3,"Eh, Whatever......","Author obsessed over details of characters, kinda reminded people that a jet smashed into the Pentagon every 5-6 pages, spent way too much time on the backstory of creation of ""Monster"", and left a few good lose ends to the story. Semi Good read overall."
2,Sleeper turns into a laugher,"Starts out very promising and then degenerates into an idiotic farce complete with talking monster (with a German accent no less!) who is lonely and misunderstood. Had me going up until the last portion of the book which is so ridiculous it doesn't require the reader to suspend belief, but rather requires the reader to wear a gag to prevent the frequent emission of unintentional guffaws...What a sad denouement...I now know why Steven Spruill wrote this under a pseudonym!"
1,Poorly written and silly,"'and that about sums this book up. Terrible sub story about a pentagon official who has lost his arm who thus becomes the focus of the ""mosters"" sympathy (they are both different, see?) There are many unintentionally funny passages, corny, uninspired writing, and the plot never really engages."
4,Sleeper Hit,"A very pleasing ""monster"" story with your typical heroes, villians, scientists and military types. Quite a fun and easy read. I found it interesting that a Steven Harriman book is copyrighted by Steven Spruill. Perhaps Harriman is a pen name for Spruill, whose works I've also enjoyed very much. Whoever wrote it, give it a try."
3,A monster stalks the Pentagon.,"Despite having a premise ripe for either satire or metaphor, the monster on the loose novel Sleeper just does what every other monster on the loose novel does, albeit slightly better than average in some departments. The premise mixes elements from Lincoln Child & Douglas Preston's novel Relic with Peter Benchley's White Shark and sets them in the Pentagon. The book could have been set anywhere for all the meaning the location brings the story, but the characters are well developed. You have Ed Jeffers (the Brody character), the ""Mayor"" of the Pentagon and who is the first to discover the beast, Dr. Andrea Deluca (the Hooper character), the lovely scientist that also creates some romanitc tension between the two male heroes, and Terrill ""Terror"" Hodge (the Quint character), the adrenaline junkie Navy SEAL sent in to fight the beast. Sleeper is a quick read, but, in the end, there is nothing in it to separate it from the monster pack."
5,The Relic meets Jaws...,"I just finished SLEEPER in one breathless sitting. Great heroes, a terrific monster, and an amazing setting (The Pentagon) all combine to make this book a rollercoaster that compares with the best of Peter Benchley and Preston and Child.If you like your thrillers high-concept and adrenalin charged, this book was written for you."
5,An action-packed winner!,"Author Harriman has put together a novel of suspense, science fiction, characterization, plot, current-day reality, and just enough GENUINE science to make this novel a winner. There is something for everyone: complex and believable characters, real current events in a real place (the Pentagon), a forward-leaning plot of great action coupled with suspense, excellent science based on genetics, psychology, and medicine, with only the slightest suspension of disbelief required (as is required in most good fiction, science- or otherwise). The novel ties together several disparate elements: The Abwehr and the Gestapo from WWII, modern medical science, current day events surrounding the events of September 11, 2001, and more, all expertly done. I read this in just two sittings, and I am now looking forward to more of the same from this author. Highly recommended."
3,A Sleeping Hit!,"I liked this book and it's concept. It was never boring, but however, I found that it could have been better.Solid story, great characterization, but the monster's description was hazy.I really wanted more in terms of scene setting, character's descriptions, but it kinda lacked that. But the story itself still steamed ahead, never really slowing down to bore me.And that's saying something! Yeah, I've read better. And I've read far worse. This one is worth picking up."
1,Not-So-Hot Nuts,"(Second submittal. Do you print negative reviews?)Short and sweet: Humor doesn't transcend the ages like classical music, or classic popular music. Not as good as I remembered it."
3,QUALITY OF FABRIC IS LOW,"The quality of fabric ruins the beauty of colors and great work, very thin fabric but fill helps. It does not worth the regular price far off...perhaps what i paid ...however I could rather not to have bought it... Shipment and delivery was fine."
2,Absolutely beautiful...but doesn't fit today's thick mattresses,"I ordered this quilt in a King size and it simply isn't big enough for my 18"" thick top mattress. It doesn't even come down half-way on each side of the mattress, so the sheets and part of the mattress show below it. The only way I can see this might work is to use extra large white sheet and a white bedskirt to blend them together. I am going to try this, but I may have to give up and use it on a Queen size bed. It would be a perfect fit for that. ALSO NOTE!!...it only comes with TWO standard shams and we all know that King beds need three. Still,it is a beautiful, well made quilt so I am keeping it."
1,"Low Quality, smaller size","I bought this quilt because I've read the reviews here. I got a King size for my queen bed, so the size works out fine . The problem that I have is its quality of the fabric. It feels and looks cheap, very low quality. I paid less than $19.99 and I regreted buying it."
2,Looks great but smaller size,"I ordered a queen size quilt and is not fitting on the queen bed. I think I would have gone for a King size one. The quilt looks good but the quality is not great as I expected, Its okay to have one if the size matches."
3,nice,"Not he best quality,but for the price is acceptable. Colors are bright and vibrant, and it does look very nice on the bed. I am using it on a spare bed so do not know how the wear and tear of everyday would be."
5,The Lost Realms,"This is a masterful work. I can easily see why this is a ""Must Have"" reference for travelers to ancient sites in South America. The way the links between the ""Old"" and ""New"" world cultures is presented is compelling. The space aliens part detracts from what is otherwise a textbook for history classes."
3,In Time,The book arrived in excellent condition and I can't wait to read it. It's in my line up. I am looking forwad to reading the entire series.
4,An interesting point about Meso American discoveries,"I have 3 of Sitchen's books, the best being ""The 9th Planet""...""Lost Realms"" takes up where The 9th Planrt left off but this time in the Americas. Both books are food for thought."
3,Difficult to Read,I find this author's works difficult to read with alot of personal inflections that are not necessarily based on historical information.
3,Still have not received book,I have no review because I haven't received books!!I have checked my old mail/packages and consulted with my wife still no sign of said books!!! I need to know where/when this book was sent or miled too.
5,From Sumer over Africa to America,"In this volume Sitchin compares Mesopotamia, Egypt and ancient American civilizations an comes to conclusion, that gods have visited America also. The reason for visit was simple - they have found precious metals like gold and copper, but they have also found tin, which has to be extracted from ores and gives hard bronze when mixed with copper. The sophisticated channels cut in the rocks were part of ore washing system. The resemblance of stories, buildings and myths suggests that behind names like Quetzalcoatl, Kukulcan and Viracocha stand the same deities we know from the first three volumes. The most impressive thing is that Americans didn't knew and use metals (except gold, of course), yet archaeologists have found stone blocks dressed and connected with bronze claps. And bronze must be obtained through a metallurgical process, which was surely not known nor to Mayas, Incas or Aztecs. Who needed tin from lake Titicaca? The answer is obvious."
4,A great book to take to Cancun!,"This is a great book to take with you if you are going to vacation in Cancun. It's a quick read and then you can go off to Tulum or see the great pyramid or any of the 80 or so sites and judge for yourself. Even if you only accept the dates of 800 years ago, stand there and tell yourself that people built these cities bare handed without the use of any technology!If there is a down side to these books (12th Planet et al) it is that the points tend to be made over and over. You can either accept what is said with an open mind or not. Even if the assertions are not true they're fun to read. It often reminds me of episodes of the old Dr. Who program (remember the Cyber Men?)I have always enjoyed reading these books and then checking out the evidence for myself. The pictoglyphs of the pre-native americans are very interesting as well. Maybe we'll all live to see the answer....."
2,Disappointing,"The only reason that I did not give this 1 star in each category is that it did fairly well in the ""creep me out"" factor in a couple of spots.Issues I had with the game:Needless profanity. If you're going to swear, have a reason other than trying to make the game seem--and fail--to be more adult oriented.Mindless tasks. The puzzles were challenging but not impossible, the mindless tasks (talk to the guard four or five times without accomplishing anything in between conversations) is a common complaint and rightly so.Worst of all? The ending, I mean I went through all that for such a worthless ending? Let me put it this way: Everyone dies for nothing. I was so disappointed by the ending that I immediately uninstalled the game and will definitely not be returning to Nibiru. In fact, the only good thing about the ending is that it was so final that there's no chance of a sequel."
4,Great game...leaves you wanting more!,"I'm looking forward to a sequel, the graphics were very nice and puzzles weren't too hard. I would have preferred a little more adventuring around but all in all it was a very good game and I highly recommend it!"
3,its an okay game,"This is a great game to spend a Saturday on. Its very short but the graphics are really good. Your character does move way to slow and the dialog can get pretty boring at times. I mostly like the puzzles, some were a challenge and to me the best but I am able to do a Rubik's cube so... with that said If you want action this game is not for you. If you like to take things slow and relax then buy this game."
3,Okay but not great.,"This was the first PC game of this kind that I've played. As a beginner, I found it interesting. I like that you really have to think about the situations and use your brain. Having never played a game like this before, I admit that I had to look up online hints every now and then when I got stuck. The puzzles seemed pretty hard to me and I had to consult walkthroughs for most of them. I have two complaints: #1. The subtitles contain spelling and grammar errors. Don't the programmers have spell check? Or a dictionary? #2. The ending was somewhat ... anticlimactic. I just expected more. That being said, it's not a bad buy for the $10 I paid for it. I'd like to try more games like this."
2,Nice Graphics...........but,"The idea for the game is good, has a definet goal to reach. On 2 discs that do not need to be in the drive to run is a plus. The graphics are pretty darn good.Actual game play is akin to taking a sedative, slow movements, watching your figure move from place to place gets real tiring, very sleepy actually. Making the character move is about all you can do in this game. There are a few puzzels to solve, though not as many as there could/should be. Near all the conversations are game run, the player has no, none, nada, zilch control over what is said in conversations, and you can't do anything but watch.The subtitles are written with a lot of typos, and painfully slow, even at the fastest setting.Better than nothing, though not much. My 2 star rating is entirely based on the graphics."
3,Fair,"Better then some adventure games, not nearly as good as the great ones though, Nibiru is standard adventure fare..If you are some adventure game freak in Broken Sword withdrawl perhaps you will want to check out the recent, less-inspired versions..Just don't expect that glut of creativity that was known as 90's adventure gaming."
2,Frustratingly SLOW-Save your $$$,"When I read the plot of this game i rushed out to buy it-unfortunately I didnt read further or I would have known that this is a POINT & CLICK game, and as someone else mentioned, the main character moves from here to there at a snails pace. I wanted a game similar to Myst, where you are the P.O.V. and you could go anywhere and look at anything. Not so with this game, you can only go into certain hot spot areas, and only pick up and examine certain items. You watch the main character as he slowly walks to and fro, repeatedly having to go to the same place, leave, go back, leave, go back again. UG, maddening!!!There is no way to speed up the action either. Can watch TV and play, and not miss a thing. BORING!!!"
4,Pretty Good Game,Pretty good game. Last 2 puzzles were pretty hard for me. Took me awhile and had to go on the internet to get hints to finish. Good graphics.
2,Disappointing....,"Have previously played MISSING from the Adventure Company and was hoping the puzzles in this game would be similar. HUGE disappointment. Very few puzzles - possibly six total - and most of them were pretty lame. Required very little thought.A lot of mindless babbling on the part of the ""hero."" A big ""time filler"" perhaps. Also a lot of back and forth with characters which also seemed like a waste of time. Beat the game in three sessions (about six hours total) and the ending was lame.Skip this one... buy MISSING if you're looking for intellectual challenges."
3,"It was OK, I guess","I have just recently finished the game. I only paid $[...] for it, so it was a good deal. Everyone knows of the adventure game genre. There were some good things about the game: the graphics were beautiful, foreign places. The game plays very straight forward: linear. There are only a few puzzles, one I found a little tricky. If you like this type of game, you might really like it. Not too many mind-twisting headaches. Overall there wasn't too much too it. A lot of dialog. It seems to me the game companys are making their game shorter and easier these days. I hope this review was useful."
5,A wonderful Christian Experience,A story that is wonderfully told about the Christian experience as a whole. Cobb takes you right into the lives of African believers who must reconcile the struggle between the Spirit of Christ living within them and the pagan culture surrounding them. Can't wait for the next one Melvin.
4,Black History & Historical Christian Fiction,"If you love reading Historical Christian Fiction novels, such as Francine Rivers, you will love reading this book. The authors descriptives in the book make you really feel like you are there and able to see every detail. His characters are real in their struggle to walk out their new life in Christ and leave the old behind. If you wonder what it must have been like to be a new believer in Africa after the resurrection of Christ, this is the book for you!"
5,Fascinating!,"Bought this book off a Christian website this year. It was a fascinating read. As one reviewer says, I felt like I had traveled to Africa. The characters were so real and yet so contemporary in feel that it was very easy to stay engaged. Each chapter escorts the reader into another layer of this book's depths. One reviewer found this confusing. I found it thrilling even if exhaustive. I could not put the book down and that's saying a lot since I read books over a period of many days generally. After reading the book, I discovered the author is black. I was even more intrigued. I can't speak to the historical accuracy of the book but as a piece of Christian fiction and a work by an African American, I think it deserves so much more attention than it's apparently gotten. As an African American myself, I am so very proud of this author's work and hope to read the next book in the series soon."
4,Hollywood obsession,This is a realistic story of what happens to B movie stars that are unable to give up the big screen. Hopes and dreams strive against reality as a middle aged actress struggles to regain the limelight. You will follow along with one actress as she journeys to decide just how much getting a part means to her. How far will she go? What will she sacrifice on the altar of the big screen? The answer will either surprise or distress you. I recommend giving it a watch.
3,Great concept......poor engagement,"John's novel does a great job in displaying how events come full circle as the future is compared to the times of Jesus, however, I didn't feel the sense of ""constant page-turning"" because of it. Again, this is an interesting concept, I just feel there could be more passion involved and more personlized thoughts of the main character Alden. I would complete the trilogy, but I would hesitate to consider it a classic of any sort. Simply read the Bible and you will know how this story will probably conclude."
3,Loudness's last gasp in America,"This was (thankfully) Loudness's last album with American metal singer Mike Vescera, and (unfortunately) the last gasp that this usually excellent band had with Atlantic Records in America.All I have to say is, of course you'd lose a contract if you sacrifice your talent and originality for airplay.Most of the songs on this CD sound like washed-out Fastway or Dokken on a bad day. The only songs that (just barely) save it are ""In the Mirror"" and ""Deadly Player"", which are reworked and translated versions of older songs.The band is great, of course, but the attempt to Americanize them here has finally failed. The result, sadly, is a band that sounds like everybody else from the 80s."
5,An oarsman's perspective of The Amateurs,"When I first started rowing in 1987 I happened across a copy of the Amateurs at a local bookstore. thrilled with the fact I found a book on my new sport and written by one of our best journalists I devoured it in a scant five hours. Even though I was a novice to the sport I found that Habelstram captured the pain, fears, joys, and dissapointments of boat racing perfectly. Later as a coach I would reccomend this book to my rowers so they could see that the feelings they were experiencing are not unique to them, but also shared by even the elite scullers that Halberstram observed. I also reccomended this book to the parents of my rowers so they could better understand the level of commitment it takes to row . Halberstram has done a rare thing, he has written about a subject so precisley that it will not be scoffed at by those who row, and those who do not row will not be lost in the explanation of technique and rowing history."
5,A great Recommendation to anyone,"After being recommended to read this book, I know recommend it to anyone with an interest in any sports or great literature. I do crew and mountain biking and only wish I had read this book earlier. The book follows a few oarsmen on their path to the Olympics and describes the hidden world of crew and its politics unbelievably well. What you can take away from this book is an undeniably better mental toughness in whatever you do from crew to paper pushing, this book will make you better at it."
4,"Very good book, well-woven stories","Halberstam really gets into the minds & hearts and gives names and faces and histories to these traditionally anonymous competitors. Very deep and probing and moving, and the racing/action scenes are well-written. Glad to see a focus on a minor sport, where the athletes aren't stars or icons (unlike Halberstam's latest offering on Jordan).I compete in lifeguard rowing events--much different style of rowing than sculling, but I use an ergometer to help train. While reading this book my 2500 meter erg times dropped by 10 seconds or more, not from any form or style tips but just by recalling the focus, dedication and motivation of Halberstam's rowers."
4,"Great writing, sad story","Really well written, but a depressing story. I finished the book without any happy illusions about the sport, or sports in general. Nevertheless, a valuable story about the human spirit."
2,Disappointed fan of Halberstam,"I am a big fan of David Halberstam. Like his other books, this one was well written, but I just could not get into the subject matter. The main characters that he follows were uninteresting and pretty one dimnesional in their rowing obsession. Halberstam seems to worship their dedication to a sport that few care about, but I find their masochistic pleasure in continuous pain and lonely training quite odd and certainly not anything heroic. I think that if I had been a rower at some point in my athletic career instead of a track athlete and soccer player, I would have enjoyed this book more. We've all heard the term ""too much inside baseball."" For me this book was too much ""inside rowing"" and did not translate into a broader experience for fans of other sports."
3,THE guide,"Damron's Men's Travel Guide continues to be the most complete US. Gay travel guide out there. Unfortunately, the nature of the information and the trend for gay establishments to come and go quickly means that much of the book is out of date by the time it hits the stands. A great improvement would be an online companion guide which might only be available to purchasers of the book. In lieu of that, this is the guide to carry."
3,"Yes, now WITHOUT real butter...and taste suffers big time","I'm not sure exactly when the change was made, but the last several batches we've bought no longer contain real butter. At first we didn't realize this and thought maybe we just had a bad couple of batches, but after sleuthing a bit I found that the butter has been replaced with butter flavoring -- big mistake. Now the popcorn that was much better than anything else out there, no longer tempts our taste buds. Pop Secret brand was bought out by another company and I suppose in their infinite wisdom decided to make - or at least keep - the change (probably to save a few bucks). But this will backfire on them and I'm sure the complaints have already been piling up."
2,Was the best... but now?,"The box no longer says made with real Land O'Lakes butter and evidently it no longer is. The taste is off. Evidently Diamond Foods (present owner of Pop Secret, General Mills wouldn't have made such a foolish decision) has no taste for quality. This used to be the a premier pop corn.Now its just a kernel of what it once was."
5,Best Popcorn in the World!,I love buying items and groceries on Amazon. The fact that you receive a discount for signing up for a subscription and no sales tax to pay. This makes it cheaper than your local store. Even better...it is delivered free to your front door. It can't get any better than that!
2,The ingredients have changed,"I used to love the Homestyle Pop Secret. They have changed the recipe, and it no longer tastes the same. It is not buttery now, it is just salty and greasy.They used to say contains Land o Lakes butter, now it says salt and buttery taste. Not as good."
1,OMG,I would never buy this product again. The hulls equal the amount of popcorn. It would be much better without all of the extraneous stuff. This product should probably come with a bonus pack of dental floss or maybe a discounted coupon for a water pick.
5,Couldn't ask for more,"I was wary about using this product because it wasn't anywhere near natural, but after two months of trying natural remedies and nothing working I finally decided I'd just have to bite the bullet and get this and hope that it works. Well, as I said it's not natural, but it does work like a charm. I have quite a few cats and within 12 hours the worms were all gone. I chose to put the pills one half at a time into Greenies Pill Pockets and the cats gobbled them up, no fuss no muss. Highly recommended."
3,Haven't used it yet,"I got this as a back up for if the meds from the vet didn't do the job or if they became reinfected. So couldn't really give a creditable account as to my opinion of how well the product works. On the side for any whom might read this hoping for a bit of info should their pets have this problem... Don't forget to treat your home as well as your pets. I use a carpet powder by Hartz. If you decide to use the powder as I did (my ranch house is all carpeted minus the bathrooms and kitchen, it took me 4 to treat my whole house) be sure to pick up a few of these bottles, another broom, paint mask, and have your pets placed in a room with a door that has been treated at least 24 hours. This stuff is very thick and will take at least an hour to completely settle once you have swept the powder into your carpet the directions tell you to let it stay for at least an hour but recommend 24 hours before vacuuming. Remember to wipe down all surfaces like tables after vacuuming."
4,Very good protection when you don't want to carry a laptop bag,Very nice product. I wish it came in black though. The gray shows dirt very easily. Pocket is nice to carry magazines and some papers in. Putting the charger in the pocket makes it bulky.
1,DON'T PURCHASE THIS!,It was less than an hour and I suppose I was looking for something more like Def Poetry.. You get nothing like it... a couple of yuppies just trying to explain how to write your own slams.. LAME.
3,Entertaining but ...,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I'm a serious home bread baker and assumed the author must be a baker too. Not so. Her style is witty and and an easy read, but as the book went on I found the chapters less about bread and more about the author's adventures. The recipes she included are mostly unusable. There is a factual error in one of her statements, that ever since Tuscans started omitting salt from their bread several hundred years ago, Italians have been making saltless bread ever since. NOT true! The recipe for French bread after all the rhapsodizing on artisanal French breads was for one made in a bread machine. Please ! The sections on Morocco and Jordan were outstanding, and those on the Wonder bread factory and the US military's Frankenbread were terrific contrasts."
2,Insensitive and offensive,"The book is not so much about bread itself but about the author's experiences in various cultures around the world, all connected by the common theme of bread baking. But that is not what bothered me. In fact she is privileged to have many fascinating cultural experiences which could have made for informative and entertaining reading. Unfortunately this was overshadowed for me by her constant stream of critical and demeaning comments about those who were kind enough to be her hosts. She refers more than once to the native food as ""slop"" and at one point suggests that her host is ""in our room sniffing our underwear"" while she and her companion are out exploring. Perhaps such comments are intended to be funny but I found them rude and tasteless. I envied the author's experiences but felt sorry for those who showed kindness to her only to be humiliated by her graceless criticism."
2,Spend more money for something beefier...,This was a great price and the retractable cord is great for keeping the wiring neat. But it is cheaply made and after a few months of use the too thin wires must have stop working from normal use. When pulling them out and pushing them back in various radio/entertainment centers must have caused internal damage. I have had this happen with headphones too after a while. But with this it was onyl a few months. I went and bought a more expensive one from Best Buy and it has a much thicked wire and still works great.
1,Doesn't work on ZuneHD,Horrible waste of $4. Can't get it to work with my Zune HD. Tried Settings->display->tv Output. Won't toggle to On.
5,A must have,"For those with Zunes, this is a must have. It is quiet handy for the car. the retractable cable is out the way when not in use. I bought two of these."
3,Great Retractable Cord,"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product. I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase."
3,Needs more updating,"Overall a good book, because it covers most topics related to planning and budgeting.Some chapters need serious updating. For instance Chapter 32: ""Computer applications in Budgeting, 'Microcomputer' Overview and needs assessment.."" is totally out of date with respect to software applications in budgeting (Who still uses the term ""Microcomputer"" ?.I have found this to be unnacceptable for a book with this price tag."
5,"Bernstein's New York, it's a wonderful town!","And speaking of ""Wonderful Town,"" it's so nice to hear music from this least appreciated of Bernstein's musicals. ""What a Waste,"" ""A Quiet Girl"" and Audra McDonald's enchanting ""A Little Bit in Love"" have never sounded better. Donna Murphy burns the house down with the torchy ""Ain't Got No Tears Left,"" and has fun with Patinkin and Blazer on the raucous ""Ya Got Me."" ""One Hand, One Heart"" sung by Dawn Upshaw and Richard Muenz is movingly rendered, as is Patinkin's wonderful delivery of an all-time Bernstein favorite, ""Some Other Time."" My only comlaint? Where is ""I Can Cook Too?"" A terrific recording."
5,The next stop once you've heard the originals,"As a tribute to Bernstein on Broadway, this CD is hard to beat. All the singers are stars but of a generation, ro two, beyond the originals. Naturally here's been a change of style, and these renditions are more knowing, sophisticated, and at times ironic than the originals. On their own, Donna Murphy, Dawn Upshaw, and Mandy Patinkin, among others, are masters of their craft, but I hope anyone who loves LB will also seek out the original cast albums for all of his musicals, or the clesest one can get (On the Town was remade in the Fifties). Those recordings cast a unique spel, but the next stop is this marvelous CD."
3,Disappointing,"I agree that this is a great collection. But I have to wonder: Am I the only one who got a bum copy of the CD? The songs are all mixed up on my copy, as in, most of the tracks are mislabeled: ""A Quiet Girl"" is really ""Tonight"", The Balcony Scene, printed as ""Tonight"" is really ""Somewhere"". The list goes on.So, who do I kvetch to? I'd like a copy that isn't a complete mishmash."
1,The Feel of New York,"Having spent most of my working years in NYC, I felt this CD brought the city to me. Bernstein has allways been a favorite."
1,Alert,"Please don't be misled by the recent publication date as I was. The book is in descriptive notation, not algebraic notation."
4,poor and lucky,Tony was a poor boy and not so good at school. He left school when he was fourteen and his mother took hime to a farm. The farm belonged to Mr and Mrs Wood. They had a daughter named Linda but no son so they were very kind to him. Tony worked hard and one day when he was working he found a piano in a building. He played the piano. Linda taught Tony the notes for the piano and then Tony took music lessons from Mr Gordon. Later he went to a college of music where Mr and Mrs Wood paid for him to study. He gave a lot of concerts and became a famous pianist. In the end Tony married Linda and was a happy man.
3,"talent, hard work or pure luck?!","This is a simple story of a young boy, who with a bit of luck, discovers his natural talent for playing the piano. Through the support of his friends and family and much hard work the boy becomes a world-famous pianist.It's an enjoyable story that makes you wonder, if you too may have a talent. Maybe you never discovered it, maybe you never had the support to pursue it, maybe you never worked hard enough to become the very best??!!"
3,I think it's okay,"I thought Don Knotts would be a lot more to this movie in person to make it more fun than it was Rory Calhoun did good but he is made more for serious acting in my opion,but that's just my opinion."
2,HORSE FEATHERS,THIS MOVIE HORSE FEATHERS. WAS NOT AT ALL INTERESTING OR FUNNY THAT I COULD GET MY FAMILY TO WATCH. THEY KEPT SAYING I DONT GET IT. I LOVE ALL THE CARACTORS JUST BAD SCRIPT. THANK YOU MARY FLOOD. OTHER WISE YOUR COMPANY WAS VERY PROMPT.
1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE,"I have been a die-hard Black Crowes fan since their start nearly 20 years ago and I can say without a doubt that this is the worst, most worthless biography of any band ever told. It sounds like a cheep sales pitch to buy their albums. With the exception of a few minor tidbits about the early days, essentially no useful information is revealed. I would ask for my money back if I knew a way to do it. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
5,This is one of my favorite cookbooks.,"This is one of my favorite cookbooks. So many times I have bought cookbooks and never used them. This one is about simple to make, elegant, delicious food. I have made many of the recipes and have loved them all.Supposedly the author had been writing down favorite recipes for friends and decided to publish them after doing it so many times. And who wouldn't want a friend with great taste to give them all their favorite recipes?I also bought this for my daughter who is 30 and she loves it too."
1,CORNETA CON FALLA EN EL AMPLIFICADOR INTERNO,"COINCIDO CON UNO DE SUS CLIENTES. VIVO EN VENEZUELA Y CON MUCHO ESFUERZO COMPRE EL EQUIPO. LUEGO AL RECIBIRLA SOLO PUDE ESCUCHARLO UNA VEZ. AL TRATAR DE ENCENDER NUEVAMENTE EL EQUIPO EL MISMO NO FUNCIONO. DEBIDO A LO COSTOSO DEL EMBARQUE NO PUEDO ENVIARLO DE NUEVO PARA QUE LA EMPRESA RESPONDA POR LA GARANTÍA, POR LO QUE DECIDÍ ENVIARLO A UN TECNICO LOCAL, AL REVISARLA ME INDICO QUE AMPLIFICADOR INTERNO PRESENTA UNA FALLA DE FABRICA QUE AL RECIBIR PICOS DE VOLTAJE SE QUEMA EL INTEGRADO DE SALIDA EL CUAL NO SE ENCUENTRA AQUI EN VENEZUELA. QUE DECEPCIÓN PORQUE CONSIDERO QUE ESTE DEBIERA SER UN PRODUCTO DE CALIDAD Y NO HACER QUE LOS CLIENTES PIERDAN SU DINERO.Pyle-Pro PPHP1599AI - 15'' 1600 Watt Portable Powered 2 Way Full Range Loud Speaker System w/Built in MP3/USB & Ipod Dock"
4,Don't let the price fool you!!!!,These speakers sound awesome for the money! One speaker can be set up and playing an ipod in less than a minute. I will update this review if I have any problems.
3,Pyle,"What I liked about this speaker was the high frequency, but I listen to all kinds of music and and unfortunately I like strong bass which I did not get in this speaker."
1,Defective Amp,"The ordering process was quick and easy. It was delivered within 3 days. Unfortunately I did not get to enjoy it for a day. After a few hours of using it, the internal amp blew. No output no matter what inputs I used and no matter how many times I recycled on/off. You can hear the speaker make a sound upon powering on but no sounds are produced. This is extremely disappointing. Just when it was sounding really good. The second issue was the ipod dock does not charge your ipod while using it. If you use RCA cables from Ipod to input side of speaker, the volume level is much lower. Now the worse part of this experience was I had to pay over $45.00 out of my pocket to send it back for a refund. How can I dare to risk buying again another product if I would have to pay shipping charges if it comes out defective?!Very unhappy with this experience!!!"
5,"PYLE PRO PORTABLE SPEAKER 1600 WATT 15""","I BROUGHT TWO OF THESE SPEAKERS FOR SUMMER ENTERTAINMENT, HOWEVER I REALLY ONLY NEEDED ONE THE SOUND WILL MAKE EVERYONE ON THE BLOCK JUMP UP AND DANCE FROM ONE SPEAKER. BUT TWO HAS THE POWER TOO MAKE YOUR HOUSE SHAKE AND DANCE LOVE THE TWO THE BEST WITH THE IPOD HOOK UP IN THE BACK. IT BEST TOO USE THE PLUG AS A HOOK UP FOR THE IPOD THEN IT WILL NOT SHAKE AND MESS UP YPUR MUSIC FLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
3,"Hmmm. A Tricky One, This...","I'm sorry, I'm one of those who didn't think that Floyd Collin is as brilliant as everyone seems to think. The recording is definitely of high quality, and while some of the numbers are undeniably clever and complex, the lack of proper melodylines tends to make listening laborious, and I got the impression that Guettel was, perhaps, trying a bit TOO hard to be clever. Tracks such as ""It Moves"" caused me to lose interest, and a lot of the lyrics are irrevocably banal; but I will admit I WAS hooked by numbers such as ""Heart an' Hand"", the haunting ""Daybreak"" and, of course, ""The Riddle Song"". Perhaps a bit of time and patience will change my mind; but for now, 3 stars out of 5 is what this CD deserves."
3,A frustrating blend of success and failure...,"I agree with the idea that Mr. Guettel is working to break some new ground in musical theatre. I find his score extremely talented and ambitious, if not particularly enjoyable or entertaining. But his lyrics are especially wanting; full of weak rhymes--even ""near"" rhymes which are unacceptable on the stage in my book.The story is dramatically static and so the songs are much ado about nothing. The opening, for example, is three songs long and tells us nothing that we don't already know: that Floyd's in a cave with hopes of riches. It's musically interesting, but lyrically--it's a bore. And it sets the trend for most of the rest of the disk.Musicals by definition are two halves: music AND words. And if ""Floyd Collins"" succeeds, it does so only halfway."
1,Turr-able Southun Akcents!,"What a cliche! Turr-able Southun Akcents!In a Broadway show! Let me start counting the other shows... Urgh. Music is nearly good. Should have used locals if you can't do it right. All right Calamity Jane, let's us go ta see Lil' Abner, n we kin tawk funny all nite."
2,Give me a break!,Talk about overrated! I only know the work from this CD (did not see the show). If you expect what you read above you will be mightily disappointed. A minor talent based on this disc.
5,Nice,"I love this product for my feet although I think most people exaggerated on the results a bit. It does moisturize really nicely though, but it is too expensive in my opinion. Found some nice foot cream by Gold Bond that works equally as well. If you are not price oriented than I recommend it."
2,IC Op-Amp cookbook - hard to read (paperback),"The information is there, but, the print is hardly readable, it is blurred and appears to be a copy of a copy and then reprinted.A shame. I would suggest not purchasing this book due to the above issue with the print quality."
3,Nice Book.,"I liked the level of detail contained in this book, it has all the details and covers a variety of types of op-amps. I noticed the back cover shows the price as $24.95 and would buy it for that price but not for $45.00 as currently offered."
4,great,"got this for a friend who didn't end up liking it but I think it is fine, just personal taste, it came on time and the price was right, so I am fairly happy with it anyway, and gave it to someone who liked it more."
1,Perfume oil,"It is doesn't smell at all, i bought this oil by mistake and i don't understand for what i paid such money"
3,Pikake Perfume Essence,"Product packaged well and arrived in good condition via UPS. Scent is definitely an acquired smell, so to speak. Doesn't take much. Perfect scent for spring and summer, preferably outdoors. Only downside is bottle has screw top and makes it rather difficult to apply product with anything other than finger."
2,It's OK,"I really enjoy this fragrance, however, this time no such luck. It smelled somewhat like what I use to use(china musk)but it seemed less concentrated. Also, the bottles were leaking and I ended with half filled bottles. Oh one more thing, they were both suppose to be sealed, but with one of the bottles, the seal had a tiny pin hole in it and the other had no seal at all...I will not be reordering or even wearing this..."
4,Nice Bed,Bought it thinking it was round and would fit in my dog's current bed - shame on me for not reading the description more carefully. The bed is nice and doesn't get so warm that it discourages the dog from using it.
5,Great bluegrass meets the Grateful Dead,"I have seen Rollin' In The Hay live many times in my five years at Auburn. This CD captures the feeling of the live show well. From originals like Opie and Me, 4:20, and Steel Rails to bluegrass standards like Will The Circle Be Unbroken and Mountian Dew, every song sounds great. They even bring a little bit of a bluegrass touch to the Grateful Dead classic, Deal. Overall, if you like bluegrass, or if you like the Dead and just think you might like bluegrass, but aren't sure, you should try this CD."
2,Be sorry you bought this,"First, the first Urban Legend was just fine when you hear that guy's part of the story, but the second one just got in the way. Think you're a big fan? Check out its price. It was even discounted and a bit expensive. Sure it's a DVD but you don't need it. If you have Urban Legend and love it it's best that you don't pick this up unless you've seen the second one at the movie theatre. My additional star to all y'all is that it makes more sense seeing both."
2,"Typical teen horror, I've seen better.","Nothing really new or exciting here. For a far better Urban Legend story with real suspense and horror see Clive Barker's ""Candyman"". For a better teen horror movie, see ""Jeepers Creepers"" or the first ""Scream""."
5,A Good Film!!!!,Urban Legend 2 is the best film I've seen for a while.I'm a big fan of Slasher films and Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2 definatly take first slot.I just love it!And the ending was such a surprise!Roll on Urban Legend 3!!!
1,This one actually made the first one look good!,"I thought the first one was alright, nothing spectuactular, but when I saw Urban Legend 2, I was blown away, but not in a good way. This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I mean I know it's a teen slasher flick, but there were barely any Urban Legends in this one, and the story was just not really there. I was so disappointed by this one because if they just followed the first one, they could have had an alright movie, but they decided to change it and it ended up just being the longest, screwed up plot I've ever seen. :("
5,Aquasana Whole house filter,I have a 3500sq ft home with 3 baths and this thing is rated at 7gpm. I thought it would be a problem but it has been great.It did cost me about $500 to have it installed. The water tastes good. I would definitely recommend this product. Especially in Southern California where we were spending hundreds every month on bottled water.
3,Okay water + plastic parts + high price = negative feelings,"Their product is made with plastic pipes and other plastic parts. I had it professionally installed, and it burst and flooded the basement soon thereafter costing me hundreds of dollars in repairs, which Aquasana refused to reimburse. I felt that they did NOT honor their warranty. Although the water has been relatively well filtered for several years, it has been at a huge cost to me when you factor in the extra expenses. The total cost for purchase (on sale) plus installation and repairs was roughly $1,600. Thus, I have negative feelings about the whole thing."
4,Flying under the radar,"The Big Dish were a Scottish trio whose members included the superb songriter Steven Lindsay and Craig Armstrong, who went on to win a Golden Globe for his score of Moulin Rouge (go figure). Their sound is a bit like a more traditional Blue Nile.""Miss America"" was perhaps their biggest hit, a melancholy track about beauty pageants. A cofavorite of mine is the jangly ""25 Years"" with its slide guitar.All in all this is a bit more mellow than their previous two releases. Still, it's not to be missed if you like stuff like Deacon Blue, China Crisis or The Blue Nile."
3,Illuminarie Swirl Bird Bath - Red,"This was a very pretty piece of glasswork. I loved it, but unfortunately after about a week or so it broke into two pieces. It wasn't smashed by anything other than some wind and hard rain. I was very disappointed that it didn't last very long. Maybe the glass is in a weakened state since it is swirled w other colors and with something that glows in the dark...(I never did see mine glow at all). Oh well, it was kind of expensive and now all I have are 2 pieces of pretty red glass. Maybe someday I'll figure out something to do with them."
5,Excellent Training Material,"This book covers all the main areas necessary for newcomers to settlement and other operational areas. The level/depth of description enables a reader to not only become aware of topics, but to understand them.I thoroughly recommend it."
1,Do not purchase. There are better books,"This book is out of date with respect to Securities Operations. Does not covers import topics as Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) or Delivery versus Payment (DvP) in an adequate manner. It felt as though chapter 29 inclusion was the result of trying to address the short comings of the material. This book needs a complete rewrite.A better book would be ""After the Trade is Made"" by David Weiss."
1,"Foreign Information, not enough data for US users","This book is written almost entirely from the foreign marketplace perspective. The 1 star is just a warning to readers expecting an updated version of Reddy's or Weiss' books. Maybe it would get a 5 star rating from readers in the UK or Hong Kong, I'm not sureIn any event, it is isn't what it is billed to be for US market participants. I returned it."
4,Well written but generic in the example,"the book is well written, definitely worth it.the only reason why I did not give 5 stars: the examples are too generic. only with generic names (for example, abc shares, global investment ltd, and so on) it's a little bit rough to follow the lines.anyway, worth it to get a deep dive in the securities operations, either if you are or not working in the insustry"
1,Worst Book. Don't waste your money and time,Most pathetic book I have ever bought on securities operations. The book is full of tables with little explanation. Very poor presentation. Don't waste your money and time. Better buy 'After the Trade is Made' by David M Weiss.
4,The art of Sumi -- brush lettering,"This is an excellent book on Sumi, the art of brush lettering. The only thing missing is an explanation of how to ""make"" ink from the soot. I had never done this type of work and the ""beginning"" book seemed to take up once the ink was made. I didn't know what was in my new Sumi kit and further what to do with what was there. A chapter on the contents of a kit and how to use each item would have helped me to get off to a faster start. Instead, I found a U-tube video of the how-tos."
2,Very basic introduction to Huna philosophy and spirituality,"If you are interested in Huna. It is my opinion that you would be better served by buying ""The Secret Science At Work"" instead.If you have questions or comments; E-mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
3,Inaccurate Title,"I'm sure the music is very splendid, but being a fan and researcher of Early music (encompassing the Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque periods), I must stress the inaccuracy of this cd's title. John Cage and Arvo Part are twentieth century composers who have been influenced by music of the past, but THEY DID NOT COMPOSE EARLY MUSIC...so why does the group name the CD this?If you're going to name your album ""Early Music,"" stick with early music."
4,a good one,"Who can say, as of now, how much of the music the KQ plays will fall, deservedly or not, by the wayside and how much of it will continue for the ages? At any rate, this CD is rewarding. I like the mix of quirky pieces with the staid, even if the title ""Early Music"" is misleading (since few original instruments are utilized in this record). Fine work; highly recommended."
3,"A pretty so-so effort, better luck next time?","Really this is a two star album, but I gave it three here because I would feel like a wretch slamming this record. After all, Kronos is a tremendous quartet and have done more to unstuff and save classical music than anyone else. How else would I have ever heard about Schnittke or Moondog? But genuine care for artists requires an honest appraisal of each work on its own and I found this to be pretty lifeless and not nearly as cathartic as Kronos fans expect. The absolute career low point comes with an awful rendering of Harry Partch that betrays the composer's aesthetic. There are good reasons to have this CD however, and many of the pieces will serve as pleasing interludes when CD changers are put on random play. All things considered, I won't be selling this one, but I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great puppet!,"I bought this puppet for use in my Church VBS program - but I might have to keep it for myself!! It is so cute! The mouth moves so well that you can give the monkey facial expressions. Like all Folkmanis products I have seen, it is very well made. It is a great size - not too small, but not so big that it is not affordable. The body (from head to top of the tail- ""butt"") is about 11 inches, the legs are about as long as the body and the tail is about 14 inches long (my kids ran off with my ruler - so those are estimates). The fur is really soft. I looked at a lot of puppets for this project and I am not disappointed with my selection!"
4,"Cute, but not as cute as I thought.","I bought this monkey for my daughter's first birthday. I'm not sure if there is a glitch in the way the mouth is stitched on my monkey, but, if I'm not careful, it makes a rather frightening, ugly expression (like it's curling it's upper lip in a snarl). I do love that it is super soft and cuddly, love the long limbs and tail, and like that I can position my fingers in the arms to make it wave or clap it's hands. It's a hit with the kids, but, now that I've had some time to shop around and see some of this company's other puppets in real life, this isn't my favorite as far as cuteness goes. I had high expectations. I Like it but, I don't love it. It is still a high quality well-made product."
3,"Good, but not great","This is a companion book to the ""Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World,"" for those who decide to venture beyond Disney's realm in central Florida. The authors do a fine job rating attractions (rides, films, displays, etc.). They use star-ratings coupled with their assessments and readers' comments, along with a healthy dose of humor--all of which will be familiar to readers of the ""Walt Disney World"" book. It's all-too familiar in the case of Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. In fact, it's simply a verbatim extract of the ""Walt Disney World"" text. Worse yet, it omits one of the best features of the Disney book: the touring plans.If you're planning a trip to Universal Studios, and/or Islands of Adventure, stick with Sehlinger's Disney book: it contains more and better coverage. Sea World receives better coverage here. And this is the only ""Unofficial Guide"" coverage of the other parks."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I had high hopes for this book as a resource in redesigning the bathroom in my newly-acquired house. Alas, for anyone who's had anything to do with bathroom remodelling, this book is way more cute than it is substantive.It's got cute little split pages so you can play bathroom dress-up and determine your style. They're fun, but they don't give you much of an idea of anything, really. More of a kid's game than a design aide.It's also got cute little press-out baths and sinks and loos that you can stick on squared paper so you can allegedly develop alternative layouts. The problem is, the cute little press-outs are far from comprehensive, and lack images of smaller-than-average tubs, or petite toilets or corner sinks. The text mentions items like soaking tubs and specialty sinks that aren't included in the stick-on figures"
4,Cute workbook,"This is a hands-on design book. Great for those that are starting to design or redesign their bathroom (daydreamers too). Included is a split page design that allows you to mix and match wall, cabinets, and fixtures. It also comes with reusable stickers and layout girds in the front and back of the book.It is jam packed with information to help you solve all of your design dilemmas. A"
2,"Dull, heavy read","I didnt like this book. Its avery philosophical look at the business full of generalisations, and maybes. Not much how to or what to do. Get The Comedy Bible instead. Youll learn a load more of useful stuff."
1,Very Displeased,"I truly thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read on the subject of stand-up comedy. It was neither helpful nor insightful. All the ""advice"" within this book comes from common sense, not real comedy experience. Mr. Stankey is trying to make a buck of off young aspiring comedians with high hopes and gives them nothing in return for their dollar."
2,Great information but a tedious read.,This book is too long and written purosely with no humor that could have made the ride more enjoyable. It turned into a highly detailed lecture. I kept reading it because it did contain wonderful insight.
5,A fine collection.,"This 4 CD set does a good job of looking at an important rock band. The thing I like is that it collects stuff from the first two albums. This was before they really started stretching things out. It also touches on the later years, covering the albums 90125 and Big Generator quite well. The box has the classic Yes artwork and the booklet is also nice. A good place to begin a Yes collection."
3,bad quality,"Book is very useful crim text, more like a treatise. Summarizes important cases withiut much depth. Quality of repair was not as advertised."
1,Simple: Do not buy this product!,"This product is infuriating. When a cd gets the slightest tiniest scratch on it, it will not play! I have a 20 dollar boombox that will play cds that this product will not play! Furthermore, one day I opened the cd changer, and one of my cds disappeared! The stupid machine actually ATE my cd! I don't even know if it will work anymore, I am so mad I won't even touch it! Spend the extra money for a better product, and maybe even one made by a different company! I only put one star because it will not give me the option to give zero."
3,TUNNEL VISION,"STAG NIGHT is a creepy journey into the tunnels of underground NY. Refreshingly, the victims aren't sex-starved teens, but twenty-somethings.The cast, led by Kip Pardue, Vinissa Shaw and Breckin Meyer, are quite good and the direction captures their underworld battlefield. It's gruesome but not overly so. While not a classic, it's a notch above most cookie-cutter flicks."
3,"Next movie in the ""Ghosthouse"" horror series. If the creatures from ""Descent"" lived in a subway it would be this movie. I say C","After a failed pick-up attempt on a subway train lands four guys and two girls in an abandoned stop at four in the morning they realize they have bigger problems then trying to find a way out. There really is not much to say about this one. VERY GOREY!!! For a ""Ghosthouse"" horror movie it actually is not too bad though. The best way to describe it would be if the creatures from ""I am legend"" and ""The Descent"" lived in the New York subways. If you are into gore and a decent story this would be a good pick up. I give it a C.Would I watch again? - I don't think so."
4,"Now, THAT'S A Bachelor Party!...","After a bachelor bash, four guys and two exotic dancers find themselves trapped deep in the NY subway system. Oh no, they're not alone, as a tribe of hideous, Rob Zombie look-alikes is hunting them! STAG NIGHT is a decent subterranean thriller w/ just enough tension and mayhem. The characters (machete fodder) are like-able, and the story is basic, underground horror 101. Would make an excellent triple feature w/ CREEP and END OF THE LINE!..."
5,Works,"Product works as described. The strong magnetic is inside the non-magnetic shaft, works well when trying to pick up only one nail or screw at a time. I wear gloves when working and this tool saves wear and tear on a good set of gloves.If you own a hammer or screw-gun, get a set of these."
4,Does most of its job.,"Overall I am very pleased with this tool. The magnets are strong enough to hold even the thinnest nail or staple. I would not recommend it for screws, though. Even though it is advertised to hold them, I tried one on low speed with my drill and it quickly began shredding the metal off the arms and magnet."
3,Over,"The Green, simple solution - push your nail, screw, tin tack through a piece of scrap stiff card .... Reuse. With a new hole if you feeling generous.USD 0.00"
1,The film is great but the book isn't.,"I could not help but make a smile on the words of the first commentator. Actually, I was also greatly touched by that great film 'The Love is Many Splendored Things'. I also was puzzled why the original book was out of edition. I realized why it was not when I checked out an old copy from a big library: well, it was a kind of poorly written love story and was nothing else.If you doubt my words, please check out the book from some library. I, for the sake of fairness, must add that other books by the same author, such as 'Eldest Son,' were interesting and instructive to me."
4,The End,I love the way this book ended. I guess the ex boyfriend in this just knew he was going to win the case. I just did not like the nosey co-worker who was always dipping her nose in someone else's business. It is a good book paying homage to educated black women about not settling for less than what they deserve.. It was an interesting but refreshing read..
4,Funny,Once again David E. Talbert never fails to give you a good laugh. This wasn't as funny as baggage claim but it was pretty thought-provoking. The opening and closing arguments the lawyers gave were well written. I liked this book because it kept my attention but the story line wasn't riveting. This was just good entertainment.
4,"Fun, Entertaining Read","I enjoyed this novel better than the author's first ""Baggage Claim"". It was extremely entertaining and I love it when a book makes me laugh out loud when I am reading and this one did."
4,Had me laughing,This book was very intertaining. This is the first time I read one of Talber's books and I wasn't disappointed. This book had me laughing. I told my friend about it and she read it and loved it as much as I did.
1,Blah,Just blah...you cannot sue someone over a broken heart in court....I know it is fiction but make it a good one. Morgan's character deserved better than a horn blowing crazy psycho. She is a lawyer and a good one for that matter...she deserved to be potrayed with class.
1,Hinges are bad by design,"Hi,I am writing about 17"" screens in general for Toshiba. I have had bad experience with hinges becoming loose on one and breaking on another. I think the problem is that the hinges are not strong enough to hold the massive screen. It would be worth your while to compare how the screen in held in various brands (both 15 and 17 in.) you will be able to see the difference for yourself. Customer service is definitely lousy. They will never call you back (called them 3-4 times ans asked to call back).Toshiba might be a great laptop, but we have not reached the age of ""defect-less"" manufacturing, and we will need customer service and replacements. Given this, lousy customer support is a drawback."
5,Bookbinding Made Easy,"If you want to learn basic bookbinding, this is a great book. It shows step-by-step exactly what to do and how to do it."
1,badly illustrated,"The information is dated, but the craft is old. The largest problems are the bad, bad illustrations and the unexplained jargon. For any beginner the book is difficult to follow. But who buys the book but beginners."
4,Excellent read about the late 20thc. quilt revival,I read this book from cover to cover as soon as it arrived. It is a highly readable story about the developments in quilting after the revival in the 1970's. I'm so glad someone captured all these developments in an easy to read book. Loved it!
4,Good product for the money,"Clayhawk appears to be a well made thrower.Assembly instructions were OK , but not great.The major dislike is not being able to change the horizontal angle of release easily .Overall, does what its advertised to do."
4,good so fae,works well. Thrown a couple hundred so far.Instructions are bad. took time to look at picture to figure out tripod assembly.
3,Violent movie?,"I find it hillarious that all those elitists are the same: they consider Chuck Norris' movies violent, yet they subjectively are keeping quiet about Tarantino's. Truth is that we watch the Chuck Norris movies because we like the man, the script is not really of importance but try telling that to those mentioned above, to them a good movie is something preferably European, black&white and not dubbed and if it has interpretative dancing in it, even better! So to them I am saying, ""Get over yourselves"", I rather watch a movie which you consider inferior anyday, simply because I will always support actors who will not sell their sense of ethics and morality."
2,Typical product of the1980's genre,"Looked like it would be a nice entertaining family movie however included foul language and wasn't old enough to be cute and wasn't new enough to have decent acting. Chuck is a great guy but acting must not be his thing.Within the first 15 minutes of the show a ""good guy"" get shot and killed. Parents of young children would really squirm over that and I never like it when a movie does that so early in the show."
2,Don't waste your money. Jeeze...,"Sorry I bought, oh well, give to library. Really and I have to say a dumb movie. I've seen better cartoons! Ha Ha! Lone Wolf McQuade is alot better. A. Arizona"
2,Just a thought in passing,"One review stated ""Greatest movie ever made"", another ""one of the funniest movies ever"" and, ""I laughed so hard it hurt"", and another more accurate comment ""I found this video in the CHEAP section of the OLDER DVD's""...daa it was in that section since, while humorous, it must have been made for kids; Limited killing (that's ok), limited love interest (so so), SUPER kick boxing (looked animated), with a cute mangy dog that liked donuts. The story used every gag to hook the unwashed. The cranky ""sweet old man"" gets killed first thing, the likeable little kid who like to jump his ""cool"" bike, the fuzzy dog, the stereo typical drinking, loner bad ass cop and nasty boss, villains wanting to take over the world and kill all minorities etc. Watch the staged fights then return the video back to the rental store."
1,This movie makes no sense,"I only have one question: Why would White Supremecists be trying to blow up San Diego in the first place, and don't you think they would get more guys on it than an aging detective and a dog? What were the other cops doing, were they all on border patrol? Wouldn't it have made more sense to use an ethnic actor SOMEWHERE in the film about white supremecists? No, this movie instead shows you that an old white cop and a canine can solve racism and stop terrorists. Nothing about this picture was believeable. This is one of the worst movies ever made, all-time. I told my kids that they could never see it again, I don't want to damage them further. Skip it."
1,Frozen solid right out of the packaging,I have tried this product twice now and the lighter part of the epoxy was frozen solid right out of the packaging.
5,Works great,Works great. I'm going to suggest some of those having problems with it drying are not mixing it correctly as directions dictate.
1,A Sinking Ship,"Absolutely one of the worst--and possibly THE worst--of all the Outer Limits episodes. Usually, the Outer Limits was a brilliant, if sometimes erratic series. Tourist Trap would've been a more apt title for this horrendous episode: after watching it, you'll feel as if you've been an unwilling prisoner for the last hour. ""Horrible"" is too kind a description."
1,I Sink the Budget Fantastic!,"If any good came out of this episode, it would probably be the fact that ""Tourist Attraction"" is the touchstone for how NOT to waste money on a uninteresting idea.The underwater photography is fairly good, even if the critters are not very convincing. The performances are fairly perfunctory and even Henry Silva as the maniacal dictator seems rather uninterested in what little is going on.The ending, where an already weakened dam breaks, flooding the city below, comes as a welcome relief to anyone who managed to make it that far into the show."
2,Tourist Attraction = 2 out of 5 stars,"If you can get over the laughable creature from the deep, then this episode is at least watchable with a few decent moments. It all starts out well, in fact, it has the feel of ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon."" The characters are not too annoying and the premise is solid, but it completely unravels halfway through the episode. It seems that after 20 minutes, the director had the actors do the script as an improv because NOTHING happens and everything just goes in circles. Which brings me to the end.............errrrrrrrr.........hmmmmmmm.....no comment.In short, the opening is solid and the premise is good, but the script and plot execution is awful."
5,Loved it,"I watched the movie and was happy to find out there was a soundtrack to it. I read all the reviews and based my purchase off of them. I was satisfied to find out that the soundtrack was just as good as the reviews promised. Great buy, love the music."
4,Intriguing movie,"By itself, the music is music is nothing special, but the movie is superb (if not bizzare). However, the music is so well adapted to the movie and is so appropriate, the hearing the music again brings back memories, images, and emotions of the movie.If you liked the movie, then buying this CD is well worth it. If you haven't seen the movie, then it probably won't be worth it."
4,A worthy discovery,"Kirsty Maccoll has been plying her trade in Britain for a couple of decades. Many of her songs contain acidic lyrics but these are always off-set by her pitch-perfect voice. While not as good as its predecessor ""Kite"", this is a perfect start for anyone new to the Maccoll oeuvre.The album contain some experimentation, with some rap beat over ""Walking Down Madison"" and a light Latin samba to ""My Affair"". While it is good to see her diversifying they are not the album's strengths. These come in a couple of lovely ballads, ""Hallowe'en"" and ""The Hardest Word"" as well as the magnificently acerbic ""He Never Mentioned Love"".This is a very good example OF Kirsty Maccoll's style and one that could blow anything that Alanis and Tori have produced out of the water. Discover this genius, tell your friends and BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!"
4,My 1st ever CD!,"I remember this one quite well, because over twelve years ago, it (along with The Pursuit of Happiness' 2nd LP) was the first CD I ever bought. Will at Walrus Music told me it was much more experimental than her first album ""Kite"", but I loved her voice and bought it anyway.I was pleasantly surprised. Though it's loaded with a lot of 'hired guns' (The Pogues, Johnny Marr), the mix of styles doesn't sound jarring in the slightest (although the opener, ""Walking Down Madison"" is a bit dated at this point). Track 3, ""Children Of The Revolution"" is one of the best non-Smiths collaborations Johnny Marr's ever put his talents to, and track 6, ""Lying Down"" is a subtle little groove that's infectious as all get out.As her ex-husband Steve Lillywhite was behind the production, this album has way too much going for it to be any less than four stars, but I generally save five star affairs for 'perfect' records. This one's closer than most."
2,Not good,"This piece is not good. It is an ""opera"", with a one page (cd insert sized page) libretto. The ""music"" has no rhythm, beat, or theme. It's noise made by common household objects, with screaming in the background. Unrelated stringed instruments occasionally play strident phrases. It does have one good quality. It is short-around 40 minutes. If you want modern music buy Adams or Ligeti instead."
1,Cats yowling,"I don't care for this particular style of japanese music. It reminds me of something I saw called kabuki, a sort of opera. I would not have bought it knowing what I know now."
4,Im glad she writes books,"Ive been reading wipplers books for a few years and i really have enjoyed them. this one together with powers of the orishas are two excelent volumes for someone interested in santeria to own. The only thing I must criticize is that she has a chapter in this book called BRUJERIA...BLACK MAGIC...this is deffinently a mis conception seeing as how the chapter is really about PALO which is also not a negative thing, but using the word brujeria was an inacuracy. Brujeria is witchcraft, a holy belief centered around Our Lady of Guadalupe and the universe. I would like to also say that this same chapter appears in Santeria the Religion by wippler, this time under the correct name of Palo. All in all this is a good one to own."
5,It looks pretty sharp,"I had a very small spot in which to put all of my tv components; vcr, ps2, satellite receiver, ps games etc.This actually works great. It gives me more shelves in which to place everything.(VCR actually fits perfectly underneath)It looks good, like a regular wire utility shelf, but in stainless steel. It'd be fitting in any teenagers room, even. The back is open for the wiring, too.The colors in my room are black and silver, so it fits right in, doesn't look like it BELONGS in a kitchen at all.I was more than pleased with this."
2,"USB Drive excellent, the Pen is POOR QUALITY!!","Yes like all of you have been saying the pen is of poor quality and broke on me the second day I had it. Plus yes I had to return the pen to my local store for exchange since PNY wont replace just the pen mechanism. Usually I LIKE PNY's stuff but this I really don't highly like because PNY don't support this product in a good way!!! I personally think if you have a part that broke they should be able to replace that ONE part without returning the whole darn product.Really it was VERY POOR planning on PNY's place for the warranty for this product!!Now if you have a problem with the TOP half they warranty the USB drive ONE YEAR, but the Pen only 30 days.Yes its a HANDY product, but you got to BABY the pen so it don't break!! That the BIGGEST downfall to the product!!!However there are many other competitor's to PNY such as Disk-Go (by EDGE) Pen sold by Wal-Mart.com and they have LIFETIME warranties for the WHOLE product!!"
1,Mechanically Weak,"The cover disconnected and exposed the electronics ten days after receipt. The separation occurred during normal unscrewing for use. Total usage estimated as eight disconnect/connect cycles at time of failure. Handling and usage had been mild (shirt pocket, desk top or dresser top) with no impact, crush, wet-down, serious thermal cycle events, or other abnormal stresses prior to failure."
2,The Pen Part is useless,"I loved this item, until the one time I dropped the pen part and now the pen is unusable. it does not twist out any more and the WORST part is PNY does not sell a replacement pen half. they'll sell you the ink cartridges, but not the pen. and the pen is only warrentied for 30 days. The USB drive is fine. But I think I'd stick to the plain jump drive, since PNY won't stand behind this item. I asked what if I LOST the pen piece?? and now had no cover. still NO WAY to get any replacement parts. HOW LAME"
2,Why not release each movie on it's own side of a disc???,Some of these movies have never seen a DVD release until now.At least give them some appreciation and not bundle 2 movies per side.It decreases quality and makes people want to pass on purchasing when finding out this fact.
1,love lies and betrayal,Haven't been able to watch this set as they are NOT All Regions as claimed. The box set clearly shows them to be Region 1 so basically conned into buying these by Amazon inefficiency.
1,I hate it...short battery life.,"I have the Nokia 6620, and when I charge the headset fully, and use it for 20 minutes, it conks out...I can't use it. It's totally worthless to me.Even if I leave it off until I use it for those 20 minutes, I still get the low battery beep, and then it dies. No standby life, no ""talk time""...it also gets rather warm to the touch during that 20 minutes..."
4,early moog recording,"I have had this recording for a looooong time, admittedly, it is an acquired taste, but it is truly an original piece of work, and a great soundtrack (although some of the music was not actually in the movie). It is interesting to listen to this and to compare it to other works of electronic music that have evolved since its' inception. Wendy Carlos was a pioneer."
4,Fat-free,"The preferred soundtrack version for this landmark soundtrack found itself in musical realms as equally innovative as the cinematic counterpart. Carlos's '71 score merges breathy synthesizers with classical composition in a way that feels scarily undated, reaffirming all the horrific beauty inside the controversial film while standing as its own bleak vision."
5,The best film score of all time!!,"A Clockwork Orange's whole score is very great. It mixes weird music with classical music. Any fan should, nay, must! get this soundtrack."
4,A Clockwork Orange,Great work but not so good in the recording quality. Finally Timesteps in the complete version.Dario Viecelli
5,Sonic bliss!,"I am so glad I bought this. I hear so much more on the CD than on my worn-out soundtrack tape. I highly recommend this to fans of the film, classical music, new age music...just about anyone. Wendy Carlos makes her synthisizers sing. I also like to hear the music not included on the original soundtrack. Do yourself a favor and get Tales of Heaven and Hell, it is a great companion to this CD and wonderful in it's own right. What else is there to say. I love it. I've already downloaded it my iPod so I can listen to it in my local milk bar."
4,A Must for Kubrick-philes...,"This release is vastly superior in audio quality to the Warner ""Clockwork Orange"" original soundtrack release. Features the extended versions of great tracks like ""Timesteps""--all around it's a great album, and includes tracks that were never used but definitely create the vibe of the film when you listen to them. Only beef--there still are some segments (such as when Alex is attacked by the well) that remain unreleased from the original film, so ""almost"" belongs before ""Complete"" in the title."
3,Not the Original Recordings,"After listening to this several times, something struck me as rather odd. It seemed some of the songs just didn't sound the same as the cues used in the film. I know these are from the digital masters, but I am positive they are not the same performances Carlos submitted to Kubrick. These are ""re-performances"" whereas the artist has performed the same music again on the same instruments, probably because they didn't have the rights to re-release the music again if it became the property of the movie studio. This is akin to how some film scores were re-recorded by orchestras and released, because the rights couldn't be secured (ala Blade Runner, and numerous Star Wars performances). While it's great to have the entire electronic score as it was originally intended, I'll only keep the tracks not present on the original soundtrack release."
1,I have not yet recevied any of those CD......,"Dear Amazon,I am INCAZZATISSIMO with your company.I have not yet received any of those CD purchased, but the thing that makes me even more arrabiare is that I have not yet had no report from you in this regard.What has happened to my CD?I want an answer now!"
3,Limited in use,"We received this toy as a Christmas gift for our two year old. Unfortunately, the toy is limited in its use. There are only certain numbers, musical items, etc. on the 'laptop'. I would have hoped it would have numbers and letters, or shapes and instruments, children would be able to learn more about numbers and letters, etc. instead of such a smattering of items. I like the idea very much though."
5,My 20 month old loves it,Its cute. My daughter plays with her laptop while mommy and daddy are on ours. Great idea.
2,Looks like you bought it at a dollar store for $1,"I bought this for our 8 month old and was shocked when I received it. It's made in China and, while I know most plastic, electronic toys are made in China, this really looks like something that you would buy for $1 at the Dollar Store. It reeks of cheapness. I am sending it back and ordering another ""laptop"" for my baby from a more reputable brand."
3,Not as vibrant as I expected,"While my rating does not reflect in any way the talent of the artists on this cd, it does reflect my impressions of the performances. The album does not capture the excitement and the tension of Piazzolla's bands. Unless you have all of Piazzolla's work and need to hear other interpretations of it, I would reccomend buying something by Piazzolla's band such as: Concert in Central Park, Tango:Zero Hour, La Camorra or The Rough Dancer and the Cyclical Night."
2,The worst of Kremer's Piazzolla recordings,"The title of this recording is misleading because only eight of the eleven pieces were actually written by Piazzolla. And, those of you that like your music sans vocals, you will be disappointed to learn that two of the eight pieces by Piazzolla are sung and one is narrated leaving only five Piazzolla instrumentals.The vocal pieces are inappropriate and break the spell of this recording and are not even sung in Spanish. As a matter of fact, the ""Preludio Para El Ano"" was translated from Spanish to Italian so that the diva would be able to sing in her native language! The other French vocal piece is also loud and obnoxious.If you can get this cheap then do so because two pieces by Piazzolla, ""Pachouli"" and ""Milonga Per Tre"" are exquisite as is ""Los Mareados"" by Juan Cobian.At 51 minutes, the skimpiest of the recordings chronicling Kremer's voyage across the music of Astor Piazzolla."
5,A most excellent performance of Piazzola!,"Simply one of the best cd's I have heard. The music is wonderful, the performers beyond belief. A superb performance of Piazzola, and if you like this cd you'd also love Kremers other Piazzola cd, Homage a Piazzola. El Tango also has some very entertaining vocal selections, and a truly beautiful version of Milonga per Tre, and a very upbeat and lively version of Michelangelo 70."
5,Yo amo El Tango!,"Tango elicits numerous responses and everyone has special things they like abou the music and the dance. Indeed, one could say that Tango is a culture and world unto itself and Piazzolla is the ruling god on high. His works made Tango accessible to the rest of the world and bridged the gap between it and other types of music (jazz, classical, popular).This is an individual interpretation - but then what recording is not? The details are stunning in their brilliance, the tension a counterpoint to the dreamy melodic line. The pace never seems hurried and each line is extended to the breaking point. Especially appreciated are the vocal recordings since so many times we forget that Tango was - and is - primarily a song of temptation. Buy it."
1,Do Not Purchase,"Name brand is wayy better, scratches and dust came with it and a stench, I have a armstrong now get armstrong!!!"
4,Volume II (Western Shore),"This book (ISBN 0-9613008-2-5) is actually titled ""Bay Tripper Chesapeake Bay Travel Guide Volume II Western Shore"" and is not to be confused with the other edition ""Volume I Eastern Shore"".This book is a handy guide to have with you as you explore the many small towns along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. The book lists attractions, lodging, restaurants, and more for each town."
5,20 Minutes of brilliance...,"Baton Rouge should have been HUGE; I was around when they came out and I couldn't believe they weren't big. The songs are well written - think Bon Jovi with more balls. Great hooks, melody and sing along choruses - Kelly Keeling sings his guts out on this album and Shake Your Soul. Lance Bulen is a solid, not flashy, player.Lights Out On The Playground has 20 minutes of some of the best hard rock/metal you will hear. Desperate, Tokyo Time, Vampire Kiss, The Midge II and The Price Of Love are all fabulous rock n roll. These songs hit every thing great about rock in the 80's/Early 90's. If you like anything about music in this era - BUY THIS!This album doesn't bring anything new to the table - it simply ROCKS."
3,Better Than Todays Plastic Pop,"If I was given a choice between today's B Rap/Hip-Hop and that from the 1980's/early 1990's .... I would chose this. It may not be the best and most classic of all time, but it's better than today's plastic pop. Much like music of this era, this album merely followed the main stream of doing things, and I find the old main stream more desirable than today's mainstream. This may not be an essential in your collection .... but .... at times this recording can be quite humorous."
5,As Nasty As They want To Be,This is for the rap fan when you want to listen to something fun. Other rappers and rap groups have tried to copy these type of lyrics but just can't compare. You definitely can't listen to this with your kids around but when you do get a chance to listen you may find yourself laughing out loud like a kid. Highly recommend.
3,Censored ...from the LP version,"I love this group, but the CD loses stars for what appears to be censoreship.I was disappointed to hear on this CD that they censored certain songs (Me So Horny)...from the LP version.The CD version of ""Me So Horny"" is very tame from the LP ...its sound like the ""safe"" version they played on Arsenio Hall (late night talk show) years ago.Caveat Emptor"
5,COVER TO COVER SEX!!!,"This album is a very funny one if you are comfortable with your own sexuality. Every song deals with sex and the disrespect of women. I think this is great album, and most guys should too, women on the other hand, might get insulted when they hear the album content !"
5,great,This seller was great. I received my purchase in less than a week. Had no problems with them at all. I would definately order from them again.
2,A waste of time....don't bother...,"I bought this album when I was young (like many others here). I did it because 2 Live Crew were being censored at the time, and I was under the influence of ""support the artist from the government censors"". Unfortunately, many bands and filmmakers use this as a marketing tool, so people like me (and many others reviewers here) rush out and buy the garbage they're putting out. Most of the rap albums I bought over my life were the result of this phenomenon. 2 Live Crew are/were a bunch of idiotic rappers who just liked talkin' dirty. The first few times you hear this, it's kind of funny. It quickly wears off, and you're left with a really dumb album by a bunch of really dumb guys pretending that they're saying something worthwhile, when they don't even come close. So a lot of us got suckered into buying this junk, such is life. It's really shallow and just a waste of time."
1,Only because I can't give it zero stars,"I see that Altec Lansing has decided not to correct the defect from the previous model that causes the hissing in the right satellite. For the same amount, you can get the Creative Inspire T3030 with a wired remote, better sound and no hiss."
1,Cheap but Expensive,"If you need speakers for you laptop or desktop, you may want to check a small shelf system. After all, these are not portable. Spend a little more money, but get what you want, a solution, not a problem. The interference in these speakers is really annoying, and I don't use my cell or any other devises... I am returning these today."
4,Better for games or movies than some music,"The sound of the satellites is a little bit thin, metallic and hollow. The quality of the treble is pretty good for a cheap system though, and the subwoofer is also good. Beside the tinny quality of the satellites, there's some problems around the lower part of the satellite's range, the crossover region.I'm not sure what the fake-surround does exactly. It can help sometimes, but sometimes it's too much, too weird and phasy-sounding.For music, I have a pair of 1-ways with paper cones, that give a better overall tonality, and better imaging. The treble is really rough but the mids are better. Now, the crisp treble and good bass of the Altecs would be good for games where you want excitement, also for movies where I think having a subwoofer helps. For music, if you listen to hiphop or electronic music then this is a good choice for the price range. For midrange tonality at this price though, I think a good 2.0 system might be better."
5,Excellent sound for the price,"The sound from these speakers is excellent, especially considering the set is only $50. The speakers have a rich sound with impressive bass, surprising for the cost and the size. The set is compact and it has a nice, clean design. I use them primarily to listen to music from my MacBook (I simply plug in the speakers' 1/8"" plug into the laptop's headphone jack). I'm happy with this purchase and would highly recommend these speakers."
2,Decent sound but too much interference,"I bought this system to replace the Altec Lansing 221 Amplified system I had for years with no issues. Like other reviewers, I got a static-ky noise as soon as I plugged the speakers in, something I thought odd as this never happened with my old system (also around $50.) The static decreases somewhat when I move it. However, I listen to a lot of classical music and the noise is still audible no matter how far I move the speakers away. The sound is relatively decent but I am replacing this system. For good speakers, please look elsewhere."
5,As Advertised,"I bought these speakers because they are very inexpensive, and I was unable to find reviews that weren't less than great, a little hard to believe. They do sound great and I like that the subwoofer isn't enormous, taking up all the space under my desk. I think the volume control on the subwoofer is a must. I use these speakers in my office at work, so I can't turn the volume up without disturbing others. The most telling thing is that the sound is full and balanced at low volumes. So many of these small systems only sound good with the sound turned up. Ever notice, at the store when you ask the salesperson to demo a system, the sound is going to get cranked up to warp volume. To me, the one drawback is that these are not the sexiest looking speakers, but if Altec Lansing screws up the sound for a sexier look they have blown it."
2,Stay away if you use wireless networking,"I've had these speakers for about a year. The sound from them is actually fairly good, but if you will have them anywhere near a computer with wireless networking, I would strongly suggest you stay away from them. Any time there's any network activity on my wireless card, the speakers crackle horrendously. I would only recommend these if you use a wired internet connection on the computer you connect the speakers to; they're completely useless if you have a WiFi connection."
4,What a surprise!!!,"Though a ""Mandy Patinkin"" fan, I made TERRIBLE jokes about this album before even hearing it. ""Yiddish songs?"", I thought. Well, upon hearing this recording at a friend's (who is even hipper than I), I was enchanted. What beautiful, enchanting music! It calms me down even better than a Xanex. Everyone needs one!"
5,Patinken's sweet voice flavors classic Yiddish favorites!,Mandy Patinken's beautiful and sweet voice brings new life to classic Yiddish favorites. Those of us who grew up listening to Yiddish music welcome this album and hope it is the start of a revival of this long lost treasure. From sweet to robust he captures all the nuances of this magical language.
3,Tick Collar,"I've used these collars before, and they are effective at preventing ticks from attaching to the dog's skin; however, they don't prevent the dog from bringing ticks inside the house. Also, the listing neglected to say that the 25"" collar is for dogs over 60 lbs, which is an important piece of information to include. I have a 6 lb. dog and was worried that the bigger collar might have too strong a dose of the tick killer in it. I will go to the entirely pets website directly next time."
4,Good product,So far so good for this collar. I was desperate since the preventive drops weren't working and my dog still had ticks.
2,Be Careful,"We took two young dogs (less than one year old) to the vet yesterday with 104 plus fevers and extreme listlessness. The culprit turned out to be these tick collars. If the collars get wet, they put out more amitraz. If dogs play together and chew on each other's collars during play, a toxic reaction can occur. Luckily treatment with Yohimbe turned the dogs around."
1,Beware- serious reaction possible,"My Maltese had a serious skin reaction. The collar literally ate the skin away on about a 3 inch area around the dogs neck and inside the ears. He is literally covered in scabs from underneath his chin to the top of his chest and all around his neck plus the inside of his ears, basically everywhere the collar touched He has long hair on his ears- I guess the hair brushed the collar constantly.My Cocker had no problem whatsoever. I will say the collars absolutely kill ticks. I was desperate as the area I live in is infested with ticks.I would just say to check your dog really well for at least the first month of wearing the collar for signs of trouble. It happened really fast and progressed rapidly."
4,"Great, but getting out-of-date","First off, let me state that this is a great atlas. It has all the roads you'd ever want to drive on, and many you don't want to. It gets four stars for that alone.But the maps are getting out of date. It hasn't been updated in nearly a decade, and there are many roads that aren't accurate any longer. The most egregious example of the atlas being old is that it STILL lists the SAC Museum as being located in Bellevue, though it moved to Ashland years ago.Overall, though, it's 99% great. I've used mine until it was dog-eared and tattered, and then bought another that's well on its was to getting worn out. As soon as they update the maps, I'll buy another."
5,The BEST peanut butter sandwich cracker!,Everyone in this house thinks that these are the most amazing peanut butter sandwich cracker we've ever tasted! The crackers are so crisp! The flavor is nothing like your major brand cracker--it's so much better. Highly recommended by my college students who commute and have to carry snacks to hold them through the day.
3,Too salty for me,"Everything about these crackers are great (organic, pack size), but the sodium content is too high for me...12% of the DV per pack (4 crackers). I know that everyone has a different level of taste for salt, so take this review with a grain of salt....no pun intended. Out of personal preference I like the lightly salted versions of chips, nuts, etc. I want to taste the food more than the salt. They have sprinkled these peanut butter crackers on the outside with salt, so I rub as much of this off as possible, but they still taste too salty to me. The peanut butter is yummy, but I won't reorder this product. I will pass this order on to the niece and nephew, and will hope that in future they will come out with a reduced sodium version."
5,Organic Peanut Butter Crackers - YUM!,My kids and I love these. They are so yummy! I bought them during a lightening deal otherwise they seem too expensive to me. Keep a box in the car for when the kids are hungry and we're on the go.
4,Little healthy snack,"The whole family loves the snack pack! I don't mind the kid eating these between meals, and the are perfect to take on car trips."
3,From Back Cover,"One look at the mannequin in the Manhattan department-store window and ambitious executive Eric Harmon knows no woman could be that perfect. But the leggy blonde is actually ex-model Dallas Shea. And she's very much alive. When he spies her at a stuffy corporate dinner, he's amazed it's actually her - his flawless beauty. And he's got to find out if the mystery woman feels as authentic as she looks.Good thing Dallas is aroused, too. Being Eric's mystery woman has had her hot 24/7! But there's only one way to keep the embers burning. Reveal nothing about herself, except what she expects from him in the bedroom. Play up the fantasy. And pray he never gets more than a glimpse of the truth."
4,Funny family movie,"I can guess why this film didn't do well in theaters. It's designed like a chick flick, but the stars and main characters are all guys. Still, it's actually quite funny. A young marketing guru joins a tech startup and forms a team of geeks and dweebs in order to try to build a $99 laptop. What makes the film funny is how eccentric some of the characters are. I especially like Tiny, the overweight pervert. He just has some great timing. It's not the funniest plot ever, but it is entertaining."
3,"Very cheesy, but entertaining nonetheless","Being somewhat of a geek myself and former resident of silicon valley, this movie immediately appealed to me. However, my girlfriend, nothing like me, found it innane and stupid.The film manages to deliver a few laughs and lots of cheese, all of which make for an entertaining movie. And really, that is the key to this one. You will be telling yourself while watching this that everything about it sucks, the plot is unbelievable, if not predictable, the acting, well for what it is the acting isn't bad, and there is a total lack of real character development. However, these shortcomings will quickly fade away as you find yourself enjoying this one in spite of your own inner critic.On the whole it is fun to watch, not just once, but even multiple times. And in the end, even for all its flaws, it ends up being a cute and fun flick."
4,Excellent for the whole PC World,This is an excellent movie ideal for those PC gurus and wannabes alike to hold on to.
2,corny&ok,I saw this movie over the weekend&thought it was corny&Predictable but it passed the time so no harm no foul.iy had a few laughs but that was about it.
5,Great Book!,"I found Showing the Flag the Civil War Diary of Moses Safford to be an excellent source of information on life aboard a Civil War era warship. Being a former Navy man who had sailed the Mediterranean, I really enjoyed seeing how many things were similar to my cruise in the Med over 100 years later.The editors did a great job and I really appreciated the footnotes. This book is a must read for any one looking into what life was like on a Civil War warship and the only one still in existence today! If you do visit the USS Constellation while in Baltimore's Inner Harbor area, I feel reading this book prior to your visit would greatly enhance your experience onboard the ship.Joe Erdmann"
4,"AWESOME, EDUCATIVE AND ENTERTAINING, EVEN FOR ADULTS!","This is a rather unusual DVD, it has animal stories in poetry form, and my kids (5 & 6) just love it! For the price, you'll get 4 full hours of joy, with story after story, each one with a special life lesson (fable). You will not regret it!"
2,What's all the hype?????,This one totally escaped me...I can't believe it won so many Tony Awards. Most of the music sounds the same ...without a real melody to be found. A Rent wannabe that falls way short.
2,Not living up to the hype.,"All the hype and samplers were great. But, calling this show the next ""RENT"" just ain't right. Also, raved as a ""rock and roll musical"". It is NOT. Some okay music, however, no show stoppers and no hummers."
3,Gorgeous Music - Adult Lyrics,"The songs and arrangements on this album are beautiful. I really enjoy the rich vocal harmonies. However, the lyrics for most of the songs use so much adult language that I feel uncomfortable playing this CD at work or around anybody I don't know well."
3,A music video onstage,"Contrived? Yes. Rocking? Sure. Corny? Sometimes. Pretentious? Eh...I saw this show off-broadway and everyone went gaga for it. My personal ballast for whether a show is good or not is if it hits me in the gut. This show was trying way too hard to make me cry or move me, and it just never did. Despite all that, the performers themselves are rather good. The production values were sky high, and the show was conceived with such earnestness. The music makes for some highly commercial pop that's enjoyable even if the body of the show is trite and overdone.Now, that might have been a tilt for the extra star, but all in all, the show just feels like a bunch of bark and no bite. Still, for the average person who wants some flash and bang for their buck, I would recommend this over Rent to be sure, especially if you can see it with the freshness of the original cast."
5,Good album,"This was an album I bought my sister for Christmas a while back, so I can't really speak about it myself. But from what I've heard from my sister, she loves it and is a really good buy. So with that, I'll keep the review short and say if you're into Broadway, I highly recommend this album."
5,Absolutely gorgeous...,"...I honestly have nothing negative to say about this CD.I discovered this album through a buddy of mine who played ""The Guilty Ones"" for me and I fell in love with the music.I bought the CD, not even seeing the show, and it's just gorgeous.Standout tracks: ""All That's Known"", ""The B#$ch of Living"", ""The Guilty Ones"", ""Whispering"", and ""Those You've Known""."
5,Great show,"I just saw the show and it was fantastic. Great cast, highly talented, I can't wait to buy the CD."
4,What a musical!,"I went to see this play in December, shortly after it had officially opened on Broadway, and I really enjoyed it. The content is pretty explicit, but the play and the music present quite an accurate picture of teen angst. And once you've been through it, it never quite goes away. The cd soothes the anxious teenager within me."
5,The new face of musical theatre,"This is a wonderful recording of this superb new musical. Its success will now change the face of musical theatre and hopefully end the era of jukebox and made-by-corporate committee film-to-musical shows. It is fresh, original and has a wonderful book, score and lyrics. Its direction is gimmick-free, crisp and tight.While listening to the CD is no substitute for seeing the show, it stands beautifully on its own as an album of songs. I urge you to go out and see the show with its original cast. The replacement and tour casts that will follow will not be able to fully duplicate the magic of the original cast."
1,AWFUL,"This is my first experience with Duncan Sheik and hopefully my last. I dont understand why this show is such a success, because this score is just awful. If you enjoy Broadway musicals recordings, I'd stay away from this one. If you are young and like rock music, you may like it. The number shown on the Tony Awards show didnt win me over either. Oh well, the Tony Awards arent infallible.....(Sound of Music over Gypsy? Two Gentlemen of Verona over Follies? PLEASE.) There isnt one song that stands on its own and it all grates on the ears. I did like Rent, which has a much better score, but not this. JUNK!"
2,Best musical? Um...,"I really don't think so. I've only listened to the Cd and seen online clips and honestly, I don't know what's so great about this musical. Yes, some of the songs are good but I don't know if I could sit through this show. It does nothing for me and I just don't see what's so great about it."
5,Incredible,"The album, though amazing and a wonderful listening experience, can't compare to the live on-stage production of Spring Awakening. I've seen it twice, and can't stress enough how great this show is. I'm sure it will be around for awhile, so those of you in the area must go see it!"
4,Home with a Ghost,"I have been curious about this music for awhile. Without having seen the stage show, I have come to enjoy the music from the bubbly ""Mama Who Bore Me"" to the disturbing rocker ""The B**ch of Living."" ""Touch Me"" sounds like it shined in the show. ""The Mirror Blue Night"" haunts with a lovely melody, ""I went home with a ghost who got left in the cold who knocks at my peace with no keys to my soul."" ""I Believe"" is a lovely anthem, ""There is love in heaven."" The strings on ""Don't Do Sadness/Blue Wind"" are lovely as the melody builds, ""I've done my time looking back on it all & it blows my mind."" My favorite track is the pop rock ""Totally F'd"" with its great tension and profanity. The closer ""The Song of Purple Summer"" floats gracefully and then billows to a lovely conclusion. ""Spring Awakening"" is a worthy soundtrack. Enjoy!"
3,SPRING AWAKENING OBCR REVIEW,"Recently, I recieved the Spring Awakening Cast Album as a gift, and was very eager to listen to it, as I had heard many good things about the show. After listening to the CD several times, I think it is a good score. Not a great score, and not horrible, just good. Duncan Sheik's music is incredible, and he creates some gorgeous melodies in the songs. The music is simply phenomenal. However, it is in Stephen Sater's lyrics where the score dissapoints. In many of the songs, Sater writes lyrics that on a first listen, are very poetic and beautiful, but after further listening, don't make much sense. In other cases, the lyrics are simply bad. There are some that are good, but there are many more bad lyrics. However, I'd still recommend the CD. As I said, the music is excellent and the cast is very talented. I'd give the CD overall 3 and 1/2 stars. It's worth a listen."
5,Simply Brillaint,"Fantastic songs, performed beautifuuly. It has been in my CD player since I received it. I don't think I will be taking it out any time soon. I love it."
1,A good choose,"An interesting cd. I bought without seen the show and was actually a surprise. Mama, who bored me is really wonderful."
2,My least favorite album,"I love Rocket from the Crypt. I own six of their albums. Of them, this is my least favorite. Pretty simple.It's got some horribly recorded songs -- I get it; it contributes to a garage, spy rock aesthetic... one I don't find pleasant -- it's got some horribly written songs, and overall just sounds like a young band trying to find themselves.We're all very happy that they did eventually find themselves. So buy their other albums and don't get a bad first impression by purchasing this one."
3,"Too much of the blindingly obvious, and too Theory X","This book's filled with lots of ideas that are going to be common sense to anyone who's been around the block. ""Don't talk bad about people"", ""Don't discipline employees in front of others"", etc. If the book were half its size, and weeded out the painfully obvious exhortations, it would be much better."
4,Very Enjoyable,"While Nicholson Baker has an extraordinary grasp of the English language, my only criticism of Vox is that the language can get tedious and pretentious at times. I mean, who talks like that. But, having said that, Vox is a fabulously entertaining novel and Mr. Baker does a brilliant job of walking a fine line between voyerism and literature. An all-dialogue book is tough to pull of, but Vox does it. I would also highly recommend Fried Calamari which is a very witty all-dialogue novel about between a man and a woman on their first date together."
3,Wicked,"A whole book filled with one particular phone conversation between a man and a woman. They begin as strangers and by the end of that one phone call they get to know each other better. They like each other's voice so much that they might even meet one day. Until then, they would be satisfied with talking on the phone. When they initiate the call they have the same goal in mind. They obtain it at the end but the journey in reaching it takes a lot of work told in stories. The idea for the story is amazing. The stories told during their chat are diverse. A short work that could be finished under three hours where there is nothing to think about except read."
2,"clever, but doesn't quite get there","Great inventive use of structure, dialogue; but the device gets old fast...playing the line between commercial mass-market titillation and serious literature is ultimately a failure-not even well-written erotica can save this novel in the long run."
3,SOFT PORN FOR BAPTIST LADIES,"In this telephonic masterbat-o-thon Jim and Abbie explore there own sexual fantasies while talking on a $3.99 a minute chat line. It is tepid sex at best but nothing to dismiss as dull romance novel fair either. There are none of the ""mossy grotto"" superficialisms of that genre either. I found the fantasies to be somewhat juvenile on Jim's part but perhaps this is normal for twentysomething males. Maybe I don't care about other men's fantasies either, who knows? No person will ever find themselves scarred by reading this and those looking for a first book of modern tastful eroticism might do much worse than this modest volume. Of interest to the extremely shy, it is also small enough to hide in a purse. For the thrill seeker this might be better left on the shelf. This is the perfect book for those who seek out the naughty passages in books but tire from thumbing, there is plenty here for those weary of hand from thumbing or anything else."
4,Unique and Interesting,"A well written, interesting, unique book that keeps the reader's attention although it does slip at times. Readers interested in a smart all dialogue book between a man and a woman that hits on all cylinders should read FRIED CALAMARI by D.M. Roman."
3,Boring and very vanilla...,"I have to agree with the reviews that read that it was boring, and I'm a Nicholson Baker fan. ""Box of Matches"" was more exciting than this. If you are expecting something like the Fermata you are going to be severely let down; there's nothing kinky or arousing in this book. The discussions and fantasies are very, very vanilla and plain Jane, similar to young virgins talking. Nothing kinky or erotic, but it will help you go to sleep if you want to read it for that."
1,Shouldn't Have Wasted My Time,"This book was a total waste of time. I kept reading hoping to find some redeeming value, but alas there was to be none. The dialog kept dragging along to no purpose that I could discern. In general a very unsatisfying read."
1,"A ""best"" book of Amazon Moonies","Stephen King who on his worst day could write circles around Baker has accurately described this book as ""miserable"". This is perverted yuppie recreational reading, and its length barely qualifies it as a novel for anyone not afflicted with attention deficit disorder. Mr. Baker has opposed the computerization of libraries, which presumably means Amazon too, for which he should be applauded, unfortunately his activism does not make up for his inadequacies as a writer."
1,Vox,I read this book along with my book club as one of our Y2K selections. I must say that this was the poorest excuse for literature that I have ever read! I found it to have no redeeming qualities -- don't waste your time.
4,What Are You Wearing?,"Nicholson Baker pulls off an amazing feat by writing a novel that is one continuous phone conversation between a man and a woman. Playful, humorous, imaginative and highly erotic. I also love his book, The Fermata, a surprisingly poignant tale about a man who finds that he has the ability to stop time and doesn't use it to save the world, but to peak under women's clothing."
2,"Expecting eroticism, look somewhere else!","This level of eroticism should not have spurned such controversy at its release. I was bored and quite dissatisfied when I finished the book. What made me keep reading was the hype, BUT like a lot of sexual experiences it ended in a fizzle instead of a flourish. Your own imagination would serve you better."
3,Not enough meat or thrust,"Vox would probably have made a very fine short story, but there really isn't enough meat here to sustain a novel. At times titillating, often funny, and even revealing there isn't enough of a narrative thrust to satisfy.Not an unpleasant read, but if you want to read something really hot try Kenneth Starr's book instead."
2,The book Monica gave Bill,"This is a fairly forgettable little book, but not unenjoyable while you're at it. It doesn't age very well, but will serve as a fine example of Fin de Siècle American literature in the not too distant future, describing the anxieties, obsessions, moods and mores of the bubbling nineties. Okay, okay, it's just another Gen X novel, using phone sex dialogues as a narrative device.This book's main claim to fame however, is the fact that a copy of Vox was given by White House courtesan Monica Lewinsky to President Bill Clinton.For the record Bill returned the favour by giving her Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman, a few trinkets and DNA samples galore."
2,this is silly,"When Vox was published the critics fawned all over it. Actually, studying navel lint is more interesting. This is a silly, pretentious little book that is not sexy and will be forgotten totally. I'm still kicking myself for buying this."
4,Strangely arousing,"This book to be bursting with sexual energy and tension, though not to the point of consumation which is, perhaps indicative of the meaning of the piece. An engaging narrative with a slow wave which reveals not only the lives of the characters, but, indeed, sends a message to the wider society about loneliness and of the dangers of social intercourse with a view devoid of emotion. The erotic-intellectual nature of the calls and the dangerous cry of lustful desire make this book both engaging and titillating, strangely echoing my, and indeed, our own needs and wants. A top read for most."
2,holland eye-witness,"Not a great book. A nice pictorial, but for vacation planning I did not find this one very useful."
2,Brown Nose?,"It may sound minor at first, but Elmo's nose is actually orange. In this book, the publisher chose to make his nose brown! Elmo is an icon and a critical error such as this can be confusing to kids. Otherwise, the content is cute. My son threw it out of the tub, however, after tapping at Elmo's nose on the cover!"
3,Elmo,This is an Ok Elmo book. My daughter doesn't understand the concept of books in the bath. We read on the couch or in her chair. And Elmo has a brown nose!!!!!!???? That is weird. It is not a bad book just not something she is used to.
2,Still licking their wounds,"SAXOn was still licking their wounds from the disastrous albums ROCK THE NATIONS and DESTINY when they released this one here. It's an improvement over the others, but still not a real return to form, which would only come with DOGS OF WAR.There are some great tunes here, but the majority of them are generic forgetabble metal tunes, mos of them writeen by bassist Nibbs Carter."
2,Great System for the 1st 6 Months,"Okay, I purchased and for the first 6 months I couldn't be happier. The sound quality and PA system were great. The battery life then suddenly went down to nothing. Then I learned that the warranty is only for 90 days. The other issue is that it has an ipod charger but will not charge the Nano? I contacted the company and they acknowledged the problems but only claimed a 90 day warranty. I've been using the system plugging it into an electrical outlet. After a couple of hours of use the unit will overheat and shut off."
4,Portable pa system,"At four hundred watts this portable pa gets the job done!I purchased this pa cause it was a complete package that included a microphone. I really like the ability to use my Ipod with this pa, it has a great sound over all. Works best when used on a full charge. The time this pa saves in set up speaks for it's self. Great buy!"
4,So far so good,"Enjoying this product so far, just hoping we don't run into some of the issues that other people have run into. Volume could be a little louder though. Its not used enough to say yea or nay, but so good so far."
3,Sound skips at random,Used with the new iPhone 4 and an older iPod and the sound will go on and off at random. Happens more with the iphone4. Really annoying. Maybe a loose wire or connection? Other than that it works great. Wish I didn't throw the box away so I could exchange it :(.
1,Pure disappointment...,"I was very excited to receive this product when I first ordered it. Since I received it, I've only used it 4 times. The 1st time it worked as described. The system was however plugged into the wall. The next 2 times it worked okay. There was some static at higher volumes when running on the battery. So we were not able to fully enjoy it because we couldnt set the volume to the level we required. The final time I used it, it only worked for 2-3 minutes before shutting off. We then tried to charge it and found that it wouldnt hold a charge. The battery in this unit is not of high quality. So we were forced to listen to it while plugged in, which defeats the purpose of why I bought it in the first place. Ive had it for exactly 1 year and 2 weeks, now the unit doesnt even work anymore. Just outside the warranty window. I cant believe how cheaply made. I would not recommend this to anyone. Find a better unit even if you have to pay a few extra dollars."
3,A dead bust,THE SYSTEM WORKS FINE. BUT WHEN MY IPOD TOUCH WAS DESTROYED AND I REPLACED IT WITH THE NEW GENERATION TOUCH IT DOESN'T WORK. IT WILL CHARGE BUT THATS IT. WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY THEY SAID THAT IT WONT WORK WITH THE NEW IPOD SO IM STUCK WITH THIS SYSTEM.
5,A WONDERFUL TRIBUTE,"Like many, i had my doubts about a classical singer singing popular songs.Well, everyone makes mistakes and my doubts completely vanished when i heard this wonderful tribute to the songs of DICK AND LARRY.In fact at my humble opinion,this is the best tribute to the team since 1956 and ELLA FITZGERALD;that's a long time ago.DAWN succeeds in bringing new dimensions to these songs.I also enjoy the song selection:no LADY IS A TRAMP, no FUNNY VALENTINE but lesser known songs like HE WAS TO GOOD TO ME and EV'RY SUNDAY AFTERNOON just as good.This cd makes you realize how good LARRY HART was as lyric writer and how effortlessly RICHARD RODGERS seems to create melodies.It's a pleasure to write a critic and try to convince people to buy this.I think DAWN UPSHAW has found another admirer in her club.Go for it and judge by yourself."
2,"Excellent text, horrible format","This is an excellent textile history survey and a welcome addition to any costume/textile library. However, the changes the publishers have made in producing this edition are deplorable (check the dimensions in the product specs). The book is much smaller than the original edition and difficult to handle when one is reading and taking notes. The font is miniscule, probably about 6 point, and makes reading difficult and unenjoyable. The illustrations - which in the older edition are wonderful - are scaled down to such a small size that their impact and usefulness is diminished considerably. Publishers should keep in mind when they are making changes in format to cut costs that the reader's experience does not suffer."
4,Enlightening,How many women think abuse is just physical? The story line and characters are great. This brings to light there are many more ways of spousal abuse than just the physical side and the effect that can have on a person. I felt that I knew the characters personally and was involved in their daily lives.
5,Enchanting Treasure Hunt,"I am really surprised that this novel is considered ""young adult."" I am a senior citizen and I found it totally enchanting. I read it in one afternoon, putting everything else on hold until I could finish this book. I could visualize everything through the descriptions, I played the story in my head as I read. Characters come alive. Concept unique. Already downloaded the sequel on my Kindle and can't wait to find out what was in the last blue envelope. Enjoy!"
4,Good Little Read,"I downloaded this book on my Kindle because I found a promotion for free... After reading the whole thing I really have mixed feelings about the book. It was very interesting, and the author at all times kept me interested and thirsty for more. However, I really could not like who Ginny, the protagonist was. I really felt as though she was emotionless and there was really nothing about her that made me want to like her. The story line was great, and is worth a quick read, especially for the young females, besides that though, dont expect a ""wow"" moment after your done..."
5,Fun young adult read,I loved this story. A teenage girl sees the world and has lots of new experiences as she follows her aunt's instructions through a series of little blue envelopes. It's well written and a fun read. Recommended for anyone who enjoys young adult fiction. Caution: This book may encourage your teenager to want to travel!
3,Cute Book,"Ginny has been sent on a quest. She received a letter from her Aunt Peg to go to New York then London. The surprise, her Aunt has died. In New York Ginny gets a package with 13 notes. She is to open them in order only after fulfilling the task in the previous note. On her way Ginny meets many different people that help or hurt her depending on the situation. It was a cute book, but not super great."
4,"Fun, but hardly realistic.","This was a kind of neat book I picked up on a whim. It's about a seventeen-year-old girl named Ginny who goes off on a trip across Europe. She follows the directions her starving artist aunt left her in a series of 13 little blue envelopes. It's an interesting concept but not very realistic: what parents of a high schooler would let their daughter go traveling overseas completely alone, with no timely means of contacting them? Ginny does get into a few scrapes during her travels, but always manages to get away unscathed when the plot dictates that she should move on. The only other complaint I have is that the scenery changes too often; keeping straight the themes and atmosphere of London, Edinburgh, Rome, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and a number of places south all the way to Greece was a bit too much. Overall, however, '13 Little Blue Envelopes' is an entertaining read that goes by quickly and is perfect if you have a few hours' free time."
4,Pleasantly Mellow,"I really enjoyed reading this book. You'd think from reading the plot summaries that this book would be terribly exciting, but it's actually very mellow. You can tell that Ginny is a rather laid back girl, and the attitude of the character really sets a pleasant tone for the whole novel. All in all, I found the book difficult to put down."
4,A journey of discovery,This book was interesting and what a great way to teach independence to someone you love and also for them to learn about you.
4,I liked this book,"I got this book for my Kindle when it was free (the book, not the Kindle!) and now I see it's not anymore. I really liked it. So much so that I am going to buy the sequel (and I am CHEAP and hardly ever pay for books) I have to see what was in that 13th envelope."
4,cute pageturner,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this book. I just picked it up because it had an interesting concept, and I ended up really enjoying it. My only problem was that I got slightly confused once or twice because of some things that weren't well explained or things that weren't explained enough. However, that wasn't enough of a problem to sway my opinion of this book. I thought it was a pretty original idea & I actually couldn't put it down."
5,absolutely brilliant,"From the very beginning, Maureen Johnson pulls you right into the story, like in all of her books. Clever and charming Ginny sets off on an adventure around Europe, not sure what she's going to discover about her aunt or herself. With each letter comes a new twist, a new adventure for Ginny and the reader, with an ending you won't expect. This book is absolutely fantastic and definitely one of my all time favorites."
5,Traveling! Randomness! Surprises!,"Now this book was just too cute to be true. I absolutely loved it, although I might have been influenced by the fact that I was traveling between European airports at the time I was reading this. Two flight connections and some waiting time in between, and I finished it from the beginning to the end. Got it as a free e-book but would recommend people buying this anyhow."
4,A Fun Read,"The Last Little Blue Envelopewas fun, quick, and easy to read in short spurts.Ginny Blackstone, 17 years old; travels Europe with only a simple, ugly, green backpack, 13 sealed envelopes, and $1000.Ginny is guided by Aunt Peg's letters--each opened sequentially after completing one travel task.Following her deceased Aunt's written instructions, Ginny relives the last few months of her aunt's travel experiences.Ginny experiences the loneliness and frustrations of a naive 17 year old girl traveling alone through Europe as she meets Aunt Peg's caretaker, Richard; and a young theatrical male friend, Keith, who both help her to understand herself and her beloved and frustrating runaway aunt.I downloaded this book to my Kindle when it was offered for free.I like the series and plan to read the sequel:The Last Little Blue Envelope."
5,Lovely,"Intended for a younger adult audience, the book is a superb read for an older audience as well. It took me all of about an hour to read, given the concise vocabulary but a wondeful read to enjoy a day on the beach.Short-simple-sweet."
4,13 little blue evelopes,"i really enjoyed this book from the very begging you get sucked into the adventure of ginny. i often found myself wanting to be there, going on this adventure with ginny. its a good read and i would recommend this to everyone who likes teenage books with adventure and family aspects, also this book contains elements of love and romance what more could a girl ask for lol"
4,pretty good,I liked this book because Ginny is sent all over Europe putting her trust in her dead Aunt Peg. I think i would be fun to go somewhere and not now where you are headed in the future and taking chances on unknown things. She discovers more about herself and how she wants to live life because she is shown the extremities of life.
3,"Okay, but not great","It's light reading, started off as very charming, but got a little monotonous, and I didn't get the end at all. The story might have been a bit more believable if the character, Ginny, was a bit older. No parent is going to let their 17 year old go to Europe alone with only a backpack and no contact with home. I thought the missions that she was to follow in the envelopes would be a bit more inspiring and moving, but most of them seemed rather shallow and pointless. It's okay if you are just looking for something light without much depth. Probably a good read if you are actually 17, but for adults, I think it was a bit shallow and the characters were not developed much."
4,Wonderful Adventure,"Fantastic fast paced book and such a wonderful story.Ginny's Aunt disappears without a trace. She just took off one day and didn't tell anybody where or when she would be back. A few years later, they received a phone call to say she had passed away.Ginny received a letter, she had to go to the shop under her Aunts apartment to pick up a parcel. This was the beginning! Inside the parcel was 13 letters. In each envelope there was a task for Ginny to complete and details of what her Aunt was thinking and experiencing while she traveled by herself.Ginny travels all over Europe following her Aunts directions. She discovers courage that she never realised she had. Makes new friends and potential boyfriends. For a 17 year old, this is the biggest adventure of her life.This was an amazing adventure that does contain a sad story as well. I was crying along with Ginny and laughing. Overall this was a great book and even better knowing there is a sequel."
2,Boring.,"This book lacked plot and had no conflicts whatsoever. It may look awe-inspiring but it really isn't. I couldn't even finish it towards the end, it was THAT bad."
2,13 Little Blue Envelopes,"Great idea for a story - but just an ""ok"" book that could have been so much better."
4,13 Little Blue Envelopes,"This was such a fun book to read, since it is fast-paced and always leaves me wondering what was going to come up next. It has just the right mixture of all the perfect teen elements: romance, family, travel, and a likeable narrator. While it was hard to understand at times, because Maureen Johnson seems to jump from place to place pretty quickly, and the narrator's thoughts aren't really made clear, I still enjoyed this book very much, and I think that any other teenager will like it too."
1,Everyone Was Interesting Except the Main Character,"This book was disappointing. Never have I encountered a character pushed by plot without experiencing any kind of growth or development. I kept wondering why people were attracted to Ginny because if she had a personality, she sure kept it hidden - the young lady never says more than 2 sentences together and I don't recall a single interesting thing she said, mostly ""Uh"" and ""Ok"". Why did Keith seek her out in France, she hardly spoke to him? And I kept waiting for one of her journeys to bring her some kind of epiphany, but it seemed like each country, she stumbled around and then couldn't get out of there fast enough. And it was rather unbelievable - as shy and quiet as she was, she thought nothing of navigating through Europe, alone - this is a daunting task for all but the most savvy traveler, and yet she hardly balked at this task. The book just didn't ring true on so many levels."
3,A Great Light Read!,"While there were parts that were unrealistic, and characters I would've liked to have been more developed. Over all it was a good book and I just got the sequel and am excited to read that one-hopefully it will explain some things the first book left me wondering about."
4,Good first shoes!,"Great shoes. My son loves them, and they aren't easy for him to pull off. Once his feet got a little bigger, it did get harder to get the shoes on his feet, since you have to stretch the shoe opening *just* the right way. They are super comfortable for him though, and he loves walking in them."
1,Gives me skin rash!,I love the smell of L'aquatonic but it will always give me skin rash when I use it. I called up Lancome and they gave me my money back. The pine smell is so unique. It truly is one of a kind.
5,Season For Sonics,"When I first purchased ""Sonic Seasonings"" on a two LP set in the dimmed past, I knew the composer from the ""A Clockwork Orange"" original soundtrack. My preconceptions were not disappointed. The mixture of electronic synthesizer and natural sounds brings a rich totality that must be heard to be believed. These remixed CDs are even better than I remember them. My favorite is the Fall, when the crashing sounds of waves against the seashore meld into a warm, crisp fire by the way. It is followed by a cold blast of Winter air. Spring and Summer are equally memorable, and the addition of two more 20+ minute works brings this composition into one of the greatest pieces of the century. I strongly recommend this addition into anyone's collection of classical or new age."
5,excellant,the seasons are really well depicted you can almost feel very warn during the summer section and chilly during the winter with the icicles tinkling all around
5,Best boxed rice ever...,...the title says it all. Had a lot of boxed rice in my life and this is my favorite of all time.
2,where does the book come from???,It seems this book hab been stolen from the local library! Is it right??? That is very very very strange...
3,Don't judge a book by its title.,"This book is not what is sounds like. It's moderately interesting in its own right, but it's not what the title suggests. The author even alludes to this in the introduction, tongue-in-cheek. However, I don't find anything funny about misleading people as to the contents of your book. I think the 3 I've given it is incredibly generous."
5,excellent music,Brought the movie right back to me. This is a great cd and I enjoyed the movie and now can enjoy the music.
5,Great transaction turn over time. Shipped immediately.,Folkmanis Squirrel Finger PuppetOur 7 year old son discovered these finger puppets first at a state park in PA and fell in love with them. They can be used to teach about nature and animals in our woods. They wash well in the washing machine also! This was shipped and received immediately. Completed in a timely manner!
4,My Children's Favorite Folkmanis Puppet,My children love this chipmunk along with the barn owl and guinea pig. They have others but these three are their favorites. My only complaint is the chipmunks nose is sunken into it's face. I have tried to manipulate it to get it out but it will not budge. My children haven't noticed so this is only a small defect. Very cute otherwise.
2,Very UGly,It functions as it's intended - a finger muppet for little children.I bought it for the wrong purposes - as a side gift with a meaning behind it for a friend. It's very ugly.I would go as far as fugly to describe it. Don't buy it for any other purpose just because of the good reviews.That's a lesson from me!
5,No plastic in contact with the water,After researching electric kettles for weeks I finally found the perfect kettle. This is the only kettle that I found that does not contain plastic parts that contact the water as it is being boiled. I really don't want the water I'll be drinking to be boiled against plastic. That fact alone makes this product worth it. It also boils water quicker than a gas stove and the auto shut off works well. I have had this for over two years and it still works great.
5,Great Kettle.,"I bought this kettle to replace a Bodum kettle.Water heats fast, shuts off fast too. Great kettle."
2,Oh no another bummer!,"When I first got this Kettle I thought is was going to be great! But sadly it turned out to be a disappointment. Good design, fast but leaks from the bottom near the off on switch. I have two of these both are the same. DO NOT BUY."
1,Broke after 6 months,"Worked great but broke after 6 months. Would not turn on. It is all steel inside but the lid is plastic. Made in China.Update Oct 21, 2008. After it broke, the company replaced it without any problems. The replacement is still working but makes strange clicking sounds sometimes so it may be on the way out too. One comment about other people saying that it leaks. It is solid metal inside, no seams, so it doesn't really leak. What happens sometimes is if you overfill it, the boiling water escapes through an opening inside (close to the very top). So this is not really a defect. This is the only electric kettle I know of that is all solid metal inside."
1,Not happy with this purchase,"Over the years we have had a number of electric kettles. Most of the time they have lasted two or more years, either breaking because of a fall or eventually failing to shut off when boiled. This unit was very different!We quickly found it hard to pour without leaking water from the spout. Within about 4 weeks, it would leak from the bottom as well. It boiled and shut off fine, but every time we used it we had a towel nearby to mop up the spill.Judging from the other reviews, maybe we were just unlucky with this particular one, but we had to replace it after only three months."
1,Works for 2 days,"Bought this kettle at the Target. After 2 days of use I noticed that it's leaking around the bottom, not a lot, but enough to be dangerous, then on/off switch stoped working in ""on"" position. I've got rid of it next day."
4,chocolate lab puppet pup,"I was pleasantly surprised by the top quality of this very soft and durable chocolate lab puppet pup. I thought for the price the quality might be questionable, but I was very surprised and pleased when I received it. I had the puppy expedited and received it promptly and just loved the soft plushy feel of her and so does my grandaughter, she loves trying to make her bark and playing with her tongue. Top quality item!!"
4,Pretty Pleased,"I admit that I'm kind of a perfectionist and I guess I sort of expect everything to sound like the orininal artist (pretty unrealistic expectations). The tracks that have some chick singing along are pretty pathetic (quite frankly, I don't know why they hired her to sing along) the instrument only tracks, however, were quite suitable."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"Our two-year-old loves Dora in every form, and of course she was perfectly happy to be read this installment. But this book has a number of issues. As another reviewer has pointed out, the"
4,VERY good book,"I got this book wanting to learn more into taxidermy on small animals. Well this book works for that! IT tells you the tools you would need, it tells you how to skin and flesh, it tells you how to mount them. It really is a very helpful book. It has pictures in the book also. I just wish they were in color and there were just a few more photos in there. But other than that, its a must buy book :)"
5,Sad but true,"Ward Churchill's opinion is shared by many in the CIA, and that is the US will experience ""blowback"" for its policies. It shouldn't surprise us that this country has some people who behave like ""little Eichmanns,"" after all, US policy planners hired 1500 Nazis through ""Operation Paperclip."" We also have a mainstream media that is shaped and censored by the Pentagon (NBC is owned by the weapons contractor GE) which feeds us endless stories of how the empire is ""liberating"" the world. Ward Churchill documents the reality we often divert our attention from. Fortunately, the controversy around Churchill has sent his book sales skyrocketing, proving that the minds of ""Good Americans"" aren't as closed as they've been trained to be."
1,The Judgment on Ward Churchill's truthfulness,"Today Ward Churchill lost his case for reinstatement and backpay for having been fired by Colorado University for academic misconduct. It didn't help that he was also exposed for having lied about being a Native American when he applied for the chair of Native American Studies at CU.Academics are often too professional and polite to say what they mean. For instance the faculty committee evaluating his scholarship used words like ""plagiarism"", ""mis-statement"", ""false reasoning"", ""propaganda"", ""mis-quoting sources"", and so on, when they fired him.Being academics and professionals they could not use more layman-like speech such as ""liar"", ""phony"", and ""bigot"". But I can.If Churchill was fired for falsifying his ""research"", and even lying about his identity, what does that tell you about the content of this book?"
1,I didn't like this book at all,"I read it, and I didn't like it. It was very repetitive, saying the same things over and over. I also felt it was poorly organized. It seemed very biased and very negative. It is a hate filled book."
5,Speaking Truth to Power,"Difficult as it is for most Americans to accept, our government has been responsible for some of the worst human rights abuses and crimes against humanity committed over the past 200 years, from slavery to the genocide of Native Americans to the overthrow of peaceful democratic governments in Latin America. Ward Churchill is one of the few voices with the courage to bring these topics up for discussion, and I commend him for doing so. The knee-jerk reaction against him, while not surprising, is disappointing; until we enagage with the actions of our government, and take responsibility for them, America will continue to be feared and loathed, and American lives will continue to be lost as a result."
4,A chance to open my eyes,"Ward Churchill has been persona non grata in America since he has made strong criticisms of this country. In this book, he has listed an astounding array of factual examples of America's past role in world events. It is nothing less than an eye-opener for the objective reader.Obviously, the average American citizen will be offended at this criticism. But Churchill ""tells it like it is"" and it is too bad every American citizen is not exposed to these thoughts so that we might change our national behavior in the future.Or else, as Churchill says, (and the Reverend Jeffrey Wright recently expounded) "" the chickens will continue to come home to roost!"""
1,Ventana by George Gaytan,"Please consider ""Listen to Samples"" offer. Personally, I do not purchase unless I am familiar with (already having heard) or able to listen to samples of music."
5,Great issue of interest to SF collectors.,"Another early issue with great cover art by Alex Schomburg illustrating James Gunn's article ""On the Road to Science Ficiton: From Heinlein To Here"" (part of his book by the same name); and stories by SF greats Frederik Pohl, Barry Longyear, Martin Gardner, and many others. Valuable to any serious Sci-Fi collector for the Gunn article alone, or for the Schomburg art alone; together they make a classic."
5,"Great ""Chamber Folk"" CD","Wonderful CD. Mergers violins, clavinet and the wonderful voice of Sonya Cohen with interesting lyrics and enjoyable arrangments. Not for someone looking to 'rock out', but great for a quiet, thoughtful time."
3,"When it's good, it's good, but...","...unfortunately, most of the songs are kind of run-of-the-mill and hard to endure. That much said, it has a beautiful rendition of ""In the Pines"" that's a must-listen."
1,Make It Stop! It Feels Like It's Going To Last Forever!,"Committing suicide may be thought of as the ultimate piece of performance art, and, as such, calls for fastidious attention to appropriately theatrical detail. Place, time of year, wardrobe are all important, and music should not be overlooked. If you're considering this most significant of all human options, you couldn't find a better soundtrack for it than this CD. Make sure to leave your player in the ""repeat"" mode to ensure that the people who find you absorb the full impact. When they hear what you've been listening to, they'll fully understand the depth of your despair and conclude that, at least in your case, it's probably better this way. The thought of music like this Lasting Forever would cause Mary Poppins to speculate that perhaps, all things considered, maybe life really is a bit longer than it needs to be."
1,"Basic, Boring, Sleeper","Don't buy this book if you own and agency. ON:LY good for those who want the very basics of owning one. It's like someone did a little research on terms and definitions, complied and spit this sucker out. Total snooze-fest. I didn't learn anything and read it in about 45 minutes."
3,Not For Everyone,"This book was not written recently and many parts of it reflect that fact. It's pretty dated. It speaks mostly of the big agency world. If your already in that world, you might find the attention to accounting details helpful, as the author is clearly experienced and pays attention to dollar details. If your planning to start a small agency, (bootstrapping) you could do better than this book. If you're ready to seek funding then hire a big staff and go after Johnson and Johnson, this might have some info you could use."
3,Disappointing,"If you're looking for ways to make a profit out of an existing operation, this book might interest you. But don't look for pointers on creative and production management, or on client-agency relationships, for example. It's a slick business book, with number crunching and capitalist views. Helpful, yes, in a limited way."
3,filled with good info in the most unreadable way,"Picking up this book is a chore, but then again it was written in 1995. This was before bullet lists and visual examples, right?If you could bear through the language, the antiquated theories, the lack of any reason for someone would want to put themselves through reading another page, there are chunks of information that will be valuable to the reader, especially in client/ agency relationships, billing, and financing."
3,"Good foundation, but needs updating","Helpful, but very dated. I suspect it covers the foundational 80% of the advertising business, but advertising has changed substantially since this book was written. Technology has driven new tactics. It needs to be updated.It's worth a read if you really desire to know about the innards of an ad shop, but you'll need to find what's current elsewhere."
1,Poorly made Trap,"We purchased this trap, to use for our church. one of our members found a do all trap at a garage sale, and we decided that a second one would be great. I priced shopped and found Amazon.com had the best price, so I ordered it. When it came, my husband assembled it, and we took it out with the church that weekend. It threw about 10 clays, and the 3/4 return mechanism stripped out. Amazon.com was great to deal with and I got a full refund. The difference between the garage sale one and this one was that on the garage sale one the 3/4 cock mechanism was fully enclosed, were this one wasn't. Do- All does make some good traps, but Iwould suggestion buying at least the next step above the Backyard line. Hope this helps."
3,a tough read,"This book was very depressing to me. As the mother of a young son with Asperger's Syndrome, this book left me filled with sorrow and I almost stopped reading it because of the negativity it projects - I really don't need that in my life right now (or at anytime!). I kept reading it though, because the back cover promised a ""happy ending."" Okay, the ending was a relief, but it wasn't worth the emotional baggae you get from reading it. This author remarks repeatedly about hating her son and wallows in a sea of self pity. Her son grew up before we ever knew what AS was, and her son flounders throughout his life as a result. She rarely had anything good to say about her son and was openly embarrassed by him. I cannot recommend this book because it represents a worst case scenario from the viewpoint of a very bitter mother. People with AS in their lives don't need this extra dose of negativity.. this book did not help me in any way."
2,Just too depressing,"As a book on its own this is a fantastic and emotional story and therefore a great read. However, I would not recommend it to anyone who is bringing up a yound child with Asperger Syndrome as it is just so depressing. I truely feel for the family but it really is an extreme case and as such is likely to frighten rather that help."
3,"Gone, just like a country pie","I like this album a lot more than I did Frissell's Gone Just Like a Train. If your idea of country music is Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Dylan's Nashville Skyline and Van Morrison's Pay the Devil, you will like this album. I do not disagree with the reviewer who said that this was a record for the easy-listening country-jazz audience. This music fits in very well in my collection of Dylan, Van Morrison, Grateful Dead and Tom Waits. I listen to these kinds of artists, but when I want more of an instrumental country flavor this disc slides into the mix quite nicely."
3,"Item was defective, cause could not be determined","Item was defective, cause could not be determinedThe cardboard box was fine just the DVD cover is in the middle of heavily kinked. The German post office assumes no liability and to search for the cause in the United States would be too costly. The contents of the DVD is okay in itself, but because I have to leave in the original packaging, as it is a collector's item, I was able to test you on, because they probably German player does not work anyway."
2,Is this for real?,"I was ecstatic to find this DVD, because SRatSS has a special place in my heart, a childhood favorite.The picture and sound quality are both great. It's the EPISODES featured that make me see red.Top Ten fan selected episodes... WHO are these fans, and WHAT are they on???????Yes, a few are good. Star Sheriff Roundup, Cavalry Command, and Happy Trails are classic eps, three key points of the SRatSS series.But the other seven episodes? Pure filler, non-relevent. What about the other pivotal episodes? When Commander Eagle is rescued from the Outriders. When Fireball has a near-death crash, loses his memory, and has visions of his heroic father. When Vanquo is well and truly defeated. I'll throw in, just for fun, the cow that attacked Fireball's car when it heard the sound of that horrid horn, and Colt's hilarious teasing afterwards.If you're a true-to-the-heart fan, don't buy this collection. It'll only disappoint you."
1,"Bowie great, merchandising offensive","I bought this cd when it first came out and I love it. I have always thought that it deserves much greater recognition in the Bowie oeuvre. I highly recommend it. So why the low rating?I stopped in the local music store the other day and saw racks of reissued albums repackaged with outtakes, remixes, interviews, etc., and carrying hefty price tags. This Bowie package is a prime example. The casual listener is not likely to shell out the extra money, so these reissues are directed at the pocketbook of the more ardent fan who will have to cough up large chunks of change in order to hear the ""extras"". It is cynical, greedy and offensive marketing at its worst."
1,Please!,"I happen to be a big fan, but this is some of Bowie's weakest material. Why all the glowing reviews? There are so many other better albums Bowie did. BTWN is a dud!"
4,Judge Judy for President!,"Judge Judy, once again, tells it like it is. If you've seen her on TV then you know exactly that she's no pushover. A lot of ""bleeding hearts"" would never agree with her statements, but I was pleased to read that someone has the courage to stand up and say that things need to change. Being a family court judge, she's seen it all. Women abusing the welfare system by having numerous kids, men hiding from paying child support, people on welfare refusing to work on the basis that it is ""below them"" and so many other mini case studies fill this book.I say ""Judge Judy for President!!"""
4,very readable critique of the crazy legal system,"It appears that the US welfare system is just as messed up as that of the UK and here Judge Judy takes a very critical look at case studies that illustrate how it needs a massive overhaul.The teenage arsonist who had been medicated from age 2 by his alcoholic unable-to-cope mother; the murderer who demanded his rights be respected and the grandma of his kids (whose daughter he killed) bring them to visit him in jail; people scamming the system; criminals getting off on a technicality.Now in a well written expose Judge Judy concludes 'if someone's social condition is caused by their own irresponsibility, they are in no position to demand that we assume their self-inflicted burden'A welcome change to all the liberal claptrap that surrounds us."
1,"Entertaining but disturbing view of ""justice""","This is an entertaining read about a feisty, energetic, and committed woman, who would be totally admirable if it were not for the disquieting view of justice she holds. The cases seem to be very often decided without sufficient, or indeed any, evidence from unbiased third parties, and without any safeguards against her own personal prejudices. As a reviewer, it is not my place to say that any paricular judgement is wrong, but, in view of the apparent arbitrariness and weighting of the scales against ""abnormals"", it would not surprise me to see at least 60% of verdicts overturned in a higher court. Her admittedly entertaining rhetoric and repartee can often seduce the ""audience"" into an ""us vs. them"" frame of mind, an effect which she has consciously magnified by allowing televization. Something is seen to be done: but is it justice? A dangerous precedent in my opinion."
1,Not as cool as she thinks she is.,All I know is that watching her shows and reading bits of this book it is clear why she is no longer a sitting judge. She would not be allowed in court anymore. Her attitude and behavior are totally unprofessional.
2,"Ah, Judy","Kind of boring, despite the fact that the Judge is my idol. Of sorts. A very disjointed whiney book that should have been better."
1,Not court cases as I thought,"I got this book at the libary and I was so disapointed. From the title I thought it was a book of funny cases. Its not.Its a book on how she became a Judge. there may have been cases ,but I don't remember any."
3,Careful or you'll besot the robe!,"With all due respect, maybe Her Honor keeps getting urine on her leg because she sticks her foot where it doesn't belong?"
3,Ultra right wing view of our overburdened social systems,"I enjoyed Judy's commentary of the problems of the family and the responsibility of the family to repair the overburdened social systems. Her bantor was interesting, but the cases she presented could have provided more interest yet. This is basically her soapbox, I would have appreciated more cases of interest."
5,Eyeopening to say the least!,"If you've ever wondered what goes on in a family court in the City of New York, here's your chance to see it from the eyes of the judge. When you see Judge Judy on tv, I believe you're seeing a lighter side to her. After reading this book, you'll realize that she has had to rule on the most heart breaking of cases, only to have the social service administration or the parole system undercut what she determined to be the right decision."
3,rant-orama,"Although Judge Judy has a lot of good ideas her book, while entertaining, is just one big long rant. To see how to present her views in an eloquent fashion with excellent prose she should check out the equally conservative William A. Henry's book, ""In Defense of Elitism"". He too calls the shots like he sees them, but not in whinge mode. This is a most entertaining book though with her caustic tongue audible throughout."
4,Wake up responsible citizens of this world!,"Judge Judy, labelled as America's toughest family court judge, tells us in her book some amusing and amazing stories that she has witnessed in her long career as a family court judge. Eloquent with her words, illustrative with her stories and thought provoking with her insights, Judge Judy's values are simple: ""Take responsibility for your actions."" She says ""If you want to eat, you have to work. If you have children, be prepared to take care of them. If you brake the law, be prepared to pay."" She finishes her book by also saying that ""the Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to pursue opportunity. It does not require the government to provide that opportunity."" Wow...what a judge and what a book."
2,Hard to read.....,"First off I love Judge Judy, I think she is brilliant, funny, and right on the money with her quips and viewpoints.....secondly, i found this book absolutely tortuous to read, and gave up after about 70 pages of it, for some reason I just could not go on with it anymore....Judy's ideas on how to solve what ails our society are insightful, and worth taking note of. However, the book is so poorly written, i couldn't continue to finish it. maybe its just the way it was put togther, but this was not at all what i was hoping it would be."
3,Not enough of Judge Judy's wonderful personality,"This book is okay. Some of the cases are gripping but overall it's kind of boring. Good lessons for kids - I think we all should listen to Judge Judy, her ideas are right on and I wish more people would look past her delivery and follow her advice. While I can't say I'd read this again, Beauty Fades Dumb is Forever is a great book, she shares fun personal stories."
5,Great fighting,"The fighting in this movie is top notch, from begining to end you will be blown away by the fighting and believe it or not the special effects. The way she lights people on fire is done very well for an older movie. Brigitte Lin is my favorite and she is great in this film as always. This is not her best acting work, but I believe it is her best fighting work. If you have never seen her before watch Bride with white Hair the best HK movie ever, if you are a fan like me buy this movie you won't be disapointed."
3,"A Solid, Fun Title","This is a movie to get after you've seen Yuen Wo Ping's ""Iron Monkey."" This is a solid effort, but not as essential as ""Iron Monkey"" or Lin's ""Bride With White Hair."" Ms. Lin is wonderful as usual. Here she plays a power-mad prince's assassin, whose character grows more sympathetic as the film progresses. Solid action, with a fair amount of wire work (I like that). The humor's a bit broad, but not as distracting as in other HK films.Note: I believe the correct name of the film is ""Fire Dragon."" Trust me, there is no child fighter in this flick, on fire or otherwise (and isn't that a good thing?)."
3,If you like Barry ...,"For ""Fanilows"" it's good, my wife likes it. This CD contains one track with lead singer singing, one with just music and background vocals. This is good as it gives you an idea of what the song should actually sound like before you try to sing it. The only downside is that it does not display the words on the screen of a karaoke machine, it only provides the booklet with the words in it."
2,"Gipsy Kings, typical Gipsy kings","I find that this album is like ALL the Gipsy Kings albums; very the same material over and over. All Rumbas; over and over. I dont think they reflect true flamenco at all; as they play the same music over and over; do not do soleares; sevillanas etc; if you are a fan of modern jazzy flamenco then you will most likely like this; if you are more of the Carlos Montoya type, forget it and save your money for more authentic music..."
5,A book that inspired me,"I found this book extremely thrilling when I first read it. I had to run to Shabby Chic, and absolutely fell in love. That was 3 years ago. I still read this book periodically. It is so used it is falling apart. I derived great ideas from this book, added to my own taste, I now love my home. It is very practical with four children and Beautiful! My daughters love their rooms and join me in searching out fabulous items at the flea markets and goodwill stores. Shabby Chic is an inspiration, a quality and guide book. If you don't like the information in this book, you just don't get it. Hats off to Rachel!"
2,Beautiful Photos but lacks applicability,"Lovely photos - so if you want a nice coffee table book, this is a lovely one to have. However, if you want practical information about how to develop and apply this style to your own home, this book doesn't provide basic practical guidelines (granted, I only glanced through it quickly because I found it boring). The author photographed, at the most, 3 separate houses to illustrate the book - way too many white slipcovered down chairs and sofas - and I LOVE white slipcovered down chairs and sofas. I'm looking foward to getting her more recent book ""The Shabby Chic Home"" because I think it will be more practical and applicable to my life. So while I didn't really like this book, I've not given up on this author, nor her unique approach to this style - I think her work is worth another look, but not this book."
3,Shabby Chic,I received the book and was disappointed there was no dust cover as pictured. Would have helped if that were noted in the description.
1,It was definitely shabby !,"I ordered this book on the basis of a decorating magazine review, a definite mistake. While the book was well laid out and written, the furniture used was just what the title says - SHABBY - right down to the rumpled, saggy upholstery. If the idea of the book was to show worn, distressed finishes, it succeeded, but I'd be ashamed to decorate any of the rooms in my house using the principles outlined in this book. It was definitely a BAD purchase."
2,don't bother with this one,"i read rachels 2nd book ""treasure hunting"" before this one. it was great but made ""shabby chic"" a boring read. i would skip this one and go straight for her 2nd publication. lets hope they get better and better."
1,Dodn't bother.,"Can you say ""sea-foam green"" or ""chipped white paint""? So can RA, over and over again. The photographs are uninspired and often so small that details are invisible. Better to take a walk through your local flea market and buy whatever catches your eye. Don't waste your money."
2,don't bother with this one,"i read her 2nd book ""treasure hunting"" before this one. it was much better than ""shabby chic"". i would skip this book and go straight to her next one which was great."
1,Don't bother.,"Can you say ""sea-foam green"" or ""chipped white paint""? So can RA, over and over again. The photographs are uninspired and often so small that details are invisible. Better to take a walk through your local flea market and buy whatever catches your eye. Don't waste your money."
2,Shabby Chic,These books looked so beautiful in ebook form that I needed to go and purchase the reall thing. Wow they are really worth reading if Shabby Chic is your thing. Beautiful pictures and a good read as well.
5,Great inspiration!,I had this book at one time and couldn't find it so ordered another one because I love to look through it periodically for inspiration. I just found the original one I had yesterday so now I have two copies!
3,So many styles so few bedrooms.....,I have spent so much money on books where the authors of said books are supposed to know what they are talking about...it seems I have several shabby chic books that all say a different thing when it comes to what this style is..... This book has very nice pictures...but once again it is her definition of what Shabby Chic is.... I wish all these people could get together...maybe for a month and write one book. I really don't hate the book...... but I also really didn't get a heck of a lot of new ideas from it either. That is the reason for 3 stars....
3,Shabby Chic,"As I like all Rachel's books, I still wish there were many more pictures, and less text, the text is very informative, but I love the pics and they give people lots of ideas. But over all she is great, and I love the Shabby Chic so much I opened my own store and restore furniture and most of it gets painted white, and the soft pastels. Keep up the good work Rachael you have inspired me and many other people to look outside the box.Much success,Debra KingHome of Shabby Expressions!!!!!"
2,Pretty but useless book; bathroom reading,"This is one of those books that is great to flip through in a bookstore or friend's house but never buy. And I am quite a fan of Shabby Chic and Rachel Ashwell. So if you don't even like her stuff, nothing in this book will sustain your interest. There is not much copy to read, her ""tips"" are very generic or just off-the-mark (she says it's ok to buy termite-ridden antiques because ""a simple commercially available spray"" gets rid of termites - somehow I don't see many women attempting this), and the book is mostly photos. While pretty, the photos are sourced from the same few celebrity homes she knows, so one feels a bit shortchanged."
2,Uninspired,"Frankly, I was expecting more from this book, particularly because of the lovely cover. However, I was left uninspired. Perhaps it's because it's an older book? Perhaps I had the wrong idea of ""shabby chic""? The book is filled with pages upon pages of white rooms with white furniture. I would suggest investing your money in a different book if white rooms aren't your thing."
2,Looks a little dated,"This book was OK in its day, but when I picked it up again with the idea of giving it as a birthday gift to a friend, I saw that it looks rather dreary and old. For a fresher look at the topic, I recommend Flea Market Decorating, which I bought both for myself and for my friend's birthday. We love finding unusual accessories at second-hand stores, antique shops, tag sales, and flea markets, and Flea Market Decorating shows how to use those finds in fresh ways."
2,Depressing and old hat,"Isn't it time we moved on to fresher looks? A roomful of musty old furniture with peeling paint and faded fabrics had some appeal a decade ago, but enough already. I'd like to see this obviously talented designer and entrepreneur try something new. Clearly, she has a good eye. I hope she uses it to give us some NEW ideas."
5,Shabby Chic by Rachel Ashwell,"The book was in very good condition. Very fast delivery. Great communication from the seller. Would buy from again!The book is wonderful... If you like Rachel Ashwell and love Romantic things then this is the book for for you. Her style is warm and subtle and soft. Not in your face baroque and not too cutsie, the guys have to live with it too! Her book inspired me to redo my kitchen in a very warm pale pink and her book taught me how to use my shabby and chic things."
5,I fell in love immediately!,"I stumbled upon this book while browsing my local bookstore. I started reading it the moment I returned home. I fell in love immediately! It's upbeat text is refreshing. The Shabby Chic style is like a breath of fresh air for your home. Everything light and airy. Aswell covers everything in this book. What to look for, how to fix it and how to make it at home in your home. She also covers everything from textiles to chandeliers, from rugs to old china. It's all there. I've read this book over and over again! Shabby Chic is definately a family friendly style. I'm anxiously awaiting her second book, which is do out SOON!"
3,Nice,"Heard a lot about Trinere and maybe I didn't catch her best album here - I will give her another try though. The voice, production and songs are ok , but that was basically it."
1,What a mess,"This review may be a little harsh... but, if you had to sit through an entire semester with this book you would see my point. Book this is full of errors and omissions. Something that can be explained in a few sentences take pages for this author to convey and half the time the reader still has to look elsewhere for clarification of the material. Half way into the semester I had to stop reading the thing and do subject research using other sources. Amazing someone would publish a text book this bad."
1,BAD,I was sent the completely wrong book. When I tried to contact the seller over a month ago...No response..Till this date. I have no use for the book that was sent to me
4,Danzon,"This movie is worth watching! It has fantastic acting and a great storyline. It about a woman, Julia, and the dance, Danzon. The dance is much like her life, very rigid and controlled. After Julia's partner of many years stopped showing up for their usual dance, she worries and leaves to go find him. Her journey takes her to Veracruz. There she meets many delightful people who try to help her find him. After she has a love affair with a younger man, she leaves to go back home. While she is on her journey, she discovers a lot about herself and who she is. She left not only to find her partner, but to find herself as well. This movie is great for anyone who is willing to take a risk to find themselves!"
1,"Danzon, the movie",I cna't believe that you ask me for a review. I complaint a lot about the lack of quality. It is dark. You have to guess many scenes.You have to do something otherwise I won't buy with you anymore!Susana
1,Comment,It is most difficult to make a decision to purchase when the dimensions of an object are not presented in the description especially when it is an object that needs to fit into a specific space.
4,"Good audio and video , committed performance","Gary came out of the shadows for a lot of listeners with his blues albums . The roots of rock can be found in this music and Gary wrote a classic blues tune of his own as well - Still Got the Blues . It was like he had been given a second chance - he certainly grabbed it with both hands , as he does on this recorded evidence .He has a good band here and plays very well .The direction is solid and shows all the players to good effect .If you are a fan of blues or rock guitar played with a lot of passion , then this disc is an essential purchase ."
5,I Own It,"This is one of the best Blues DVD Concert videos ever! Gary Moore is a tremendous, yet underrated talent. His soulful mastery of the guitar is phenomenal. 5 stars!!!"
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME! AWESOME GARY MOORE!!!!,it's just a real treat to see gary in dvd format! i've got everything on gary in vhs and i hope they remaster those too to dvd!!!!!Gary is brilliant as usual and to see the late albert collins it's a real treat! a must have dvd!
2,"Very best in live blues...Gary Moore tears it up,,,","Buy this DVD if you want to here the best in live blues, a guitar players, Player Gary Moore is a tone machine with a heart and soul.

The strat just dont get after it like the Heritage H157.Buy this one its a good one...great DVD"
3,A real Woman,"she has an incredible voice. If you like artist such, as chaka, mica paris, etc...real vocalist you'll like this cd."
3,almost to much,I own one of these cameras and have to say it takes wonderful pic's.some time the polaroid will miss and not put out a picture which is aggravating but the camera it self does every thing it says it will. I print pictures from it on a lexmark stand alone printer from the chip and they look great . I wish they would have kept the polaroid and made it not so big and bulky. it also is hard on batteries if you use the polaroid alot . J gillespie
3,"Great camera, but ...","For an instant camera, this one is definitely one of the best. But for a digital camera, it is way too bulky. And more serious problem, it does not have a viewfinder! LCD will be on all the time, which drain betteries quickly."
2,dmv soft lense handler,did not work for me at all. It was too soft to get hold to the lens. i will keep tryng to find the right thing for me.
3,Removing Lens Still Difficult,"Inserting contact lens works quite well. But I really had purchased this to help remove my contact lenses. I have almost as difficult a time using this tool to remove my lenses as I do using just my fingers. First time I tried it, I got both of them out on second attempt per eye. Since then, not too good. And I have tried for several weeks."
2,Too Soft,"The product got to me very fast, and was as described. I have a very hard time taking my contacts out so I ordered 3 types of available removers. I am still trying to get the hang of using it, I wish it was a little more rigid. I prefer the Lobob Soft Contact Insertion/Removal Kit for removing my contacts. I never had problems putting them in so I can't evaluate that."
2,So So....,"Turns out with a little practice there was no need for this little device. Never was able to make it work to remove lenses, and using it to insert lenses wasn't any easier than without it. It may be handy for some, but for me it's taken up residence in the closet."
1,Boo-Hoo,I could not get the DMV soft Lens Handler to work at all. Don't know why;sparce instructions.
1,Not very a useful product,This product is good for putting contacts in but not for removing. I would like my money back but that's not a sanitary thing to do.
1,piece of crap,This didn't work for me whatsoever!I tried and tried and tried and all I ended up doing was ripping a new contact and severely irritating my eye.
1,Who came up with this?,Gave it to my son who is new to wearing contacts. He said it was unusable. I cleaned it and tried it myself and managed to use it but it really isn't anything to get excited about. I can insert and remove my lenses with clean fingers easier.
1,can not remove lenses with this,"I have been using various forms of contacts for 20 years. Currently into disposable daily type lenses, which are sometimes not easy to remove. I had hoped this product would facilitate it, but sadly disappointed. It just cannot grab the lens at all. Maybe it is just me, but trying this 3-4 times on separate occasions didn't produce any benefit. I am better off trimming fingernails and just squeezing contact with fingers without touching eyeball if possible. Usually successful this way after 1-2 tries. In no way is this any better at insertion than just my fingertip."
4,Good product but you need some practice to get it work for you,"I wear contact lenses for over 10 years, never used any insert/remove devices but decided to give it a shot.That is a little advice for some of you who cannot get it work, run it under hot water for a few seconds and immidiately use it(split end to remove lenses) while it is still warm.Otherwise it is too slippery and cannot grab your lenses."
1,useless,"i'd had troubles getting my contacts out & thought i'd give this a try. turns out, you're just better off figuring out a good way to get them out with your fingers as i think this was actually MORE difficult. it really offers nothing that makes it easier. the only time i can see it being useful is perhaps if you have gargantuan fingernails that you absolutely cannot workout getting contacts out with them (mine are long, but i use them nonetheless)."
2,doesn't work,Maybe it's just me but I had trouble manipulating the handler to grip onto my contact lens properly. When I try using it to take the lens off it slips off and doesn't 'concave' to grip the lens. It's a disappointment.
1,Horrible,"I couldn't get my soft contacts out of my eyes for 30 minutes, my eyes were blood red trying so hardI got on the computer and found the DMV soft contact Handler, I thought it was my only hope.I finally got them in the mail, tried them, and tried them, and tried them, they are so soft the removal is totally awful, it will not pinch the contact, and I'm so upset. Guess it is back to using the fingers.Don't waste time and money on this.Sorry for the bad review, but it is my experience with it."
1,Useless smelly junk,"Yes it is cheap. Judging by the reviews, many are happy. As for me, it was a foul smelling useless piece of a tool..."
1,This stuff is total crap,It simply does not work. It has a hard time grabbing onto the lens and the other side has a hard time of sticking to the lens. I tried doing this 10 times then threw it in the trash.
1,No help for me.,"I can see why this should work. It's soft, supple and makes it unnecessary to actually touch your eyeball with your finger. However, I only tried it a few times, but was never able to get the soft contact out of my eye with it. In all fairness, I only tried it for about 20 minutes, then just went back to my finger and finally was able to slide the contacts down and pull them out. As time goes by, I find it easier and easier to use my finger, which is somehing I thought I would never be able to do. What I need is a tool of some type to be able to tell if the contact is inside out. That is another thing all together though, but for this review, for me it just did not help at all."
1,"A piece of junk. But no worries, you only lost a few bucks:)","This is a small piece of junk but soft and cheap:) if that counts for something. This device is not functional and the picture that you see is not the device you will get from any angle. Even if you look at the device non grab the lense with the smaller end as it is shown in the main picture. Thanks god, I only lost 6 bucks. Think twice before you make the seller $6 richer."
4,Works but I found another trick.,"I had a hard time taking new contacts out of my eyes, so I found this online and decided to try it out.It works fine, but I found that if you dry your fingers out really well, that works better than this product.I still keep this around if I get really frustrated, but I have probably a 50% success rate on using this with ease on the first try."
2,Useless as far as I can tell,"This product seemed like a great idea, though when I tried to use it I couldn't get it to work for me...perhaps I wasn't persistent enough, but now I'm just fine with using my fingers to remove my contacts..."
1,too soft and small,"In theory, the design is not bad, but because the silicone is so pliable and my contacts fit in my eyes like suction cups (even after drops - they do slide easily, just won't let go), I cannot get enough pressure to remove them easily. Also, you need to have your fingers so close to the ends of the tweezer-like end so that it does not bend (i.e. it is too pliable/soft and contorts) that you practically have to touch your eye. Therefore, it is NOT good for people with longer nails. It is also very small which wouldn't help if you have larger fingers. I have very small hands and fingers, and have cut my nails short and still have difficulty. Please see my product pictures. For reference, my ring finger is size 4. I hope this was helpful to you. I definitely would NOT recommend this item."
1,Doesn't work for me at all,"I bought this product with the hope that I could get my soft contact lenses in and out of my eyes faster, but to my great disappointment, it doesn't work for me at all. Now I have learned the real technique of inserting and removing my soft contact lenses with ease & comfort, so this ""gadget"" has landed in the trash can (good riddance)!"
5,At Last!!,"I used to get so stressed just trying to take out my contact lenses, it would take forever to do, even after I had trimmed my finger nails. But now I can keep my nails long and insert and remove my contact lenses within a few seconds and usually on my first try. Before, it could take up to 10 tries manually before I was able to do this. I've tried other aids but the DMV Soft Lens Handler is the easiest to use and most comfortable on my eyes. No more bloodshot eyes for me!"
2,Learning to use your fingers is more effective,"I had a fear of touching my eyes after first getting my contacts. After taking two and a half hours to take them out one night I decided to break down and get this. (The price was around 8 dollars when I got it)It didn't really do much, I could never get a good grip on my contact lens with it and had to resort to pinching with my fingers. (Got over my fear of touching my eyes by just doing it once an hour with no contacts in)The only reason I can see someone using this if if they have long fingernails. It also seems like using this would reduce tearing on contacts. It's just too much of a hassle to use."
1,Was Hopeful!,I used the product on a combination of hard and soft lenses. I found it was not effective for me. I never got the product to work and the return policy only is covered if the product is not opened. So how do you try it if you do not open it?
2,Not for me,"For the right person these probably work great, but much to my dissmay it made it even more difficult to put in my contacts. But I am sure the right person who is not as clumsly as me would do much better."
1,worst product ever,"This was by far the worst purchase i have ever made first of all it looks nothing like what is in the picture it looks like a mini orange toilet plunger for hard contacts (i wear soft)! no gripper pads to remove the contact just a mini suction cup that when applied to the contact to remove it, it suctions to the eye and if not carful could cause muscle damage because it wont let go of your eye!!!!!!! do not purchase"
3,Middling,"You may like Glass, you may like his previous film music, but you may not like this. Just sharing the category I'm in!Glass has done a lot of great work, and also a good deal of mediocre work, and this score is definitely in the latter. While it works well with the movie, listening to it on it's own is a disappointment. The difference between this and the great ""Koyanisqaatsi"" is important. The music for that movie was written with a core focus that permeates each piece, and althought the individuals sections are much longer than in ""Kundun,"" interest never wanes. On this soundtrack, however, the trademark repetition never really catches hold, since there always seems to be a crucial musical element missing, as if there was nothing but accompaniment. While the tracks are briefer, they say very little, and there's no build up of musical drama. Of course, it's a soundtrack, and a good accompaniment to the other element of the movie, but as a stand alone recording it doesn't work."
3,Kundun with a whimper that resonates mildly,"Well at least the soundtrack is better than the movie. And let's be honest, Mr Glass is a hell of a composer. There are a couple of bell sounds on this so deep in bass that they make your knackers resonate. Not a lot of musical tones can achieve that. But it is all a bit worthy and that was the same fault with the film. Not that it does not tell a powerful story but the telling somehow mutes the ache and sorrow of what it contains. The music is tonal, as moody as the River Tyne on a wet day but the spiritual threads win out and in the end, drown the listener. One for the background, but by the way Mr Glass note: I'm getting too old for those bells."
3,"good +, but little innovation","As most of the reviews state this is a good albumI'm just not convinced that it is a great album, or that it is better than Koyannisqaatsi. In many ways some of the good bits of the album seem like retakes of the earlier work. As a previous reviewer states it doesn't seem like Glass has advanced his art very much with this music.There is surprisingly little Tibetan influence - occasional chanting monks, some horns and cymbals, but its either not there or its melded with the minimalism so effectively it might as well not be there.Yet despite these reservations, if you like Glass you almost certainly will like this album - though the endings of some tracks seem a bit - ""er, I'd better stop somewhere"" - other parts of the album are well crafted, and it obviously affects some people deeply.If you've never heard him before try Koyannisqaatsi first. If your interested in Tibetan Music, then find some 'real' Tibetan music."
3,Glass is overrated,"This is the best CD that Ive listened to by glass and it is slightly above avereage. I have listend to other works from Glass, and this is the best one, which is not impressive...There are many artists that could have done a much more impressive job on this soundtrack such as, David Parson whom has done extensive Tibetian/meditation music. Maybe I am missing something here but the music seems to sound the same"
4,A monster lineup,"I expected a lot of this album because of the names on the cover, and I have not really been disappointed. I liked especially Roy Haynes' drumming (he was 71 years old when he made this record!), but also Gary Burtons vibraphone playing. Nevertheless, I can't call it an outstanding album."
3,Extremely straight ahead,"Individually, I love all these players. Here, they join forces for the first time. Nothing wrong. Nothing especially notable either, especially when compared with the best work of each man individually. None of the tunes stick. It's all very smooth. Great background music. You won't look up from whatever else you are doing as you listen, though...Worth buying? Yes, for background music."
5,Excellent collaboration,"What a lineup of musicians. This album grabs you solo after solo and doesn't let up till the end. Reccomended to fans of fun, improv-friendly jazz."
4,does not shine..,"Given the all star line up and the usual chemistry between Burton/Corea and Burton/Metheny in their previous colloborations this record falls below expectations. Also as a reviewer has already noted, Corea's piano sounds too thin. Having said that, the solos are crafted tight and ""to the point"" and I enjoyed Haynes' subtle rhythms. Good staight ahead jazz it may be, but nothing extraordinary."
3,"dependable, not magical","Perhaps this is unfair of me, but when I see five colossal names on the front of a cd cover, I expect an amazing record. These are all master musicians, and they play reliably, but not brilliantly.Another problem I had is with the recording itself. The piano sound is distant and tinny, capturing little of Corea's signature rhythmic inflections.Sometimes it is possible to have a recording loaded with top shelf talent that is disappointing. For example: Pat Metheney, Jack DeJohnette and Herbie Hancock recorded a dreadful album arond ten years ago.This album is solid, but each player doesn't have a full voice, to my ear anyway. Too many chiefs, not enough indians perhaps"
1,Pyle of @#$%,"Where to begin:The Amplifier has a sleek and eye pleasing exterior...that's the goodThe Bad: It has a built-in mp3 player which will ""fetch"" mp3's off a USB flash drive...stopped working after only a few months.After having the amplifier running for a few months (7 to be exact) the output is completely unintelligible. It's static ridden and intolerable. At first I thought I had a grounding issue but upon further analysis, opening up a NEW 70V speaker and attaching it directly to the amplifier with new wiring less than three feet long, the static was still there.Run...Run AWAY...fast and hard!"
4,Pyle pro PA amp,"I chose this Pa Amp because it was not very expensive and it had the built in cd player. A nice amp for my use which is amateur music recording. Strong enough to power my floor monitor. I use a shur mic and it works well with that combo, and the usb is a nice feature to have for my mp3. I would recommend giving it a try, compact, good buy."
3,not bad for low end amp,"It's not the most amazing amp system of all time, I'll give it that but for the price I think it feels fair. Sounds quality: Not very loud but it is clear and I have yet to experience distortion. The entire unit itself feels a little light for an amp but, again, I think this is because it is a cheaper end system. Amps with these features can get very expensive so, if you're looking for something that's gonna last you a lifetime, this aint it but, if you need something to get you though for a while with decent sound, this one will do the trick... good luck :)!"
5,Sensitive Readings of R&H,"Yes, this is a 'jazz' approach to Rodgers & Hammerstein, but that's what makes it interesting, even exciting to me. These songs have sometimes eluded jazz players' but although he's very 'true' to the melodies, Hersch does indeed catch interesting nuances in the harmonies. And the variations, while subtle, show simultaneously just how simple and complex this music really is, and I think why it has remained so appealing. Okay it's quiet, but one of thebest 'improvising' approaches to Rodgers and Hammerstein I've heard."
3,"Fun, but not up to expectation","The premise is cool enough. You climb the highest peak on each of the 7 continents, each one increasing in difficulty. You must purchase the service of climbers, ""train"" them by spending more money, and buy gear like rope, oxygen, medical kits, and several other items. Once you figure it out, the game is very easy. You just have to re-climb mountains many times to increase your climbers' stats. Here's where the game falls short: The mountains bear no resemblance whatsoever to their real life counterparts. The mountains are merely a series of short obstacles, and periodic camps let the climber basically fully recover. Don't expect an epic, logistical nightmare, or accurate representation of the challenges of these mountains. On the plus side, the graphics and game control are excellent, and it does make a fun novelty for rainy-weather days and armchair mountaineers."
5,Great Info!!!,This is a great video. The information contained in it is really important for people to know and understand. It is a wake up call to those who are sleeping and don't understand what's going on around them.
2,"Raises some interesting questions, but...","The movie describes out of this world phenomena. He raises some interesting questions, but the questions are oriented toward his agenda, not toward the viewers curiosity. It's only 50 min, so more of a made for TV movie. I could get more from a YouTube video."
1,A documentary for those who wish we still burned people at the stake...,"This is not a scientific analysis of the UFO phenomenon, nor is it even an objective commentary on it. If that's what you're in the mood for, skip this. Instead, this is a paranoid fundamentalist Christian take on UFOs, ghosts, and the supernatural in general. Backed up by some photos with dust specks in them and some photoshopped fairy pictures, this film has one angle and one angle only: it's all the work of the devil. Period. Apparently Satan has a UFO factory, and makes flying saucers in his spare time. Who knew?In the end, there's no science here. Only religion pretending to be scientific while attacking scientific study as demonic."
5,"""INTERESTING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON UFO'S!""","A Doctor conducts research on interesting facts of UFO's, with data, findings, and pics. His presentation does amaze the mind on a fascinating subject that so many have been curious about. The results presented are fascinating, Enjoyable, educational, and worth the time for scientific observation of discovery. A refreshing topic and I'd watch it again. Highly Recommended for all science lovers and those interested in the universe. Highly Recommended!"
4,Good but needs better production studio,The information contained in the movie is very interesting and if you follow UFO investigations and what the ancient world thought about aliens and UFOs then you should watch this movie. A professional TV station or movie producer could have really made this a good movie.
3,Is Watchers For You,"While I found Watchers to be intriguing, it also seemed sort of incomplete in that it raised more questions than it answered and it did not appear to identify the scriptures it claimed were being fulfilled to the events that it shows are happening today. I wanted to know exactly which scriptures Dr. Marzulli believes are being fulfilled the sightings of UFOs, UFO like objects and Alien activities taking place. What does it all mean? Where is it going? You're left hanging! Bottom line, it is worth renting and I enjoyed it. But I would have been sorely disappointed had I bought it!"
3,Useful,"I found this book to be useful when I started my own business. It gave me several tips on what to do and how to do it so that I didn't overspend and found the correct avenues of publicity.This book was second in effectiveness only to Guerilla PR Wired: Waging a Successful Publicity Campaign Online, Offline, and Everywhere in Between by Michael Levine."
4,"No Problems, Good Service","We have experienced no problems with this product. It arrived on time, and we are completely satisfied with the service."
3,Jimmy Z and Dr. Dre,"As a whole? This album rates a ""3"" because it isn't that bad. Though Jimmy Z is an instrumentalist, the production by Dr. Dre carries this album all the way through. FUNKY FLUTE is a good jam, and Jimmy's rendition of CRAZY YOU(A Prince song) Isn't that bad. Guest appearances by M.C.Ren and The D.O.C. are on this album. Not really a ""rap"" album. BUt it does expand Dre's musical producing talents and stays within RUTHLESS and EAZY-E's idea of spreading the WEST COAST SOUND in various forms. Eazy wanted RUTHLESS to be more than a GANGSTA LABEL. As in regards to instruments Jimmy is accomplished and also Co-Produced this album and he can be heard on Michel'le's, The D.O.C.'s and other Ruthless acts later on in the 90's...... His most featured appearance was on RAPHAEL SAADIQ's ""Ask Of You"" song as he plays the HIP HOP HARMONICA in the interlude....."
5,"The ""odd"" one",This doesn't seem to integrate as nicely as the others. It starts slow but picks up the pace about 1/3 in. Still a great Sin City tale.
3,Sound Bar,"Average sound, difficult set-up if you are attempting to connect 7.0 or 7.1 surround.Pretty good buy for the price, but I would definitely compare with a center speaker if I had to do it again."
4,Great at what it does and good looking as well.,I got this speaker for my bedroom because I don't want to run surround speaker wire all over the place. It works very well for me and with a small powered sub woofer it has plenty of bump for my PS3 games and HD DVD's It's great front and center and side effect is decent. To my ear it doesn't quite get that rear center so I miss the zing across the back of my head. Overall I'm happy with it's performance and I really like the look but I think it's overpriced for what you get even at Amazon
3,Room Dependent,"Based on what friends have said, I think that this is probably a good product depending on your room size and shape. For me, it didn't work. I connected it to my tuner (Sony STR-DE925) and I didn't hear anything close to surround sound. This was at 10 feet away since I have a 62 inch tv. When I sit on the coffee table 3 feet away, I can hear the surround.I had a friend come over and make adjustments to my tuner and he said he could hear the surround occasionally, but it was very subtle. For $800, I want something that's better than subtle.I believe this product will work, but check it out in a store before you buy it. Then be ready to return it if it doesn't work for your room.PS - I gave it a 3, only because I had to give it something and 3 is dead center... :)"
4,A More Realistic View of a Saint,"The book Secrets of the Saints includes accounts of three saints in just under 400 pages, yet is an improvement over the usual page-length summaries in books on saintly lives. An early introduction to one of the saints, St. Therese Lisieux. referred to as The Little Flower, made me wonder whether she was one example to follow. Then, while reading a book by the monk Thomas Merton who traced his life from an atheistic background all the way to conversion to Roman Catholicism, he mentioned this author, Henri Gheon, as painting a picture of this young saint that took away the Pollyanna picture we can have of her. Gheon seemed to work from the saint's life story without any embellishment which some say her sister might have added after the Story of a Soul that Therese wrote. I suggest that ordering this 1944 publication is worthwhile."
3,Too narrow,"My wife bought this shoe for me as a dress shoe that could take the elements, be comfortable and look nice. The Shoe was too narrow for my feet, other than that is was comfortable. It also was heavier than expected. The quality of the shoe is good. It would have been nice if it had fit my feet."
1,Grover in fantasy land,"Grover panders to the American fantasy of the impossible: a high service government and low taxes. This can be done by exploding the national debt, precisely what has happened in the Reagan and W years. Reagan slashed taxes and within the eight years of his administration, the national debt doubled. W was foolish enough to cut taxes while fighting a war, the first American president to do something that stupid. As the dollar dives, the foolishness of low taxation should be obvious to all, but it isn't. OPEC debated in Nov 07 whether they should stop taking dollars in payment for oil--a sign of the times.As long as foreign governments, including China, are willing to buy our government bonds, high US national spending with low taxes will last. But nothing lasts forever. Interest rates will go up big time, buying a house will be prohibitively expensive for most, and few Americans will blame themselves for the fiscal profligacy of the people they elected."
5,Great book for rationalists!,"Martin Gardner, acclaimed rationalist, debunks those who would call Robinson psychic. Some of the ""amazing coincidences"" regarding ""The Wreck of the Titan"" may in fact be explained by the White Star Line's own news releases! Gardner includes the Robinson story, plus lots of other related Titanic material. Great book."
1,Boo!!!!,This movie [both of them] is a disgrace!!!!!!!!!! Even Brooke Shields hates she was even in it!!!!! And the second was just awful with a capital A for awful. I never ever want to see either of these movies again!!!!
5,Awsome:),"It was good! Old but good. Maybe recently restored, my HDTV played it well! I haven't seen this movie in a while but enjoyed it none the less."
3,Sentimental Fool,Good movie..... picks up right where the original Blue Lagoon movie ends. A must see if you have watched Blue Lagoon.
4,classic,"these movies are great to watch, if you want a romatic evening at home.i like them both.a great buy"
3,Loved it,"Loved The Blue Lagoon more than, The Return to the Blue Lagoon. Both are classic movies. Great price, quality of picture and sound were excellent"
5,Good Life,"I had seen the Blue Lagoon but not the Return...I was skeptic about the Return be good, but it sure exceeded my expectation. Well done."
3,Kids Sex Exploiting,"Ship crash survivors, a boy and a girl, made it to the island used to holy sacrificing by indigenous populations coming from and going to nowhere at full moon.""Blue Lagoon"" is utterly about sexual developments, teen exploitations and a sort of naivety mixed with nativity while a boy of this pare was saved by a ship for just returning with a female passenger and a daughter of her back to the same island (""Return to the Blue Lagoon"")to somehow repeat his parents story with emphasis on own willingness to stay in this place after being acquainted with advances of civilization spoiled.Both films were short in nice location, beautiful environment also context is for loving under-age sex and nudity, one could say, mostly."
1,oana,"this delivewry come in 1,1/5 month.why they dont let u know before u buy it so i would have the choise if i want it or not"
3,Return to The Blue Lagoon,"Returns are never well received; However this was a rare treat. Milla is a fitting ingenue,Brooke she is nipping at your heels. The innocence was not overplayed here,and whereas Brooke and Christoher's love story was forbidden,and their bergeoning sexuality was unexpected,in the former case;In this instance is was welcomed. Her first menstral period,as well as his first erection.Then, her reliance on their staying in their paradise at the end and raising their love child. Well done."
2,'Blue Lagoon'/'Return To The Blue Lagoon'(Columbia Tristar),"I give it 2 1/2 stars.The first movie,the 1980 sappy tear-jerker should be seen with a female that you're either trying to impress or someone you're already involved with.I thought the original was okay.Plenty of beautiful scenic shots and decent job of acting by the two teens(that were ship wrecked years earlier)that are in love.Richard(Chistopher Atkins)and Emmeline(Brook Shields)experience a life together that is nearly impossible in the real world.Some nice nude scenes from(what I assume)to be a stand in for Shields.The sequel 'Return To...' (1991)I thought was a complete waste of time and trouble.Didn't even come close to standing up to the first film.Upside is it comes with the original,anyway."
3,"All the artistry, if not the voice","Nicolai Gedda is my favorite tenor among the historical greats, and he recorded a lot of music that is hard to find anywhere else. This collection of songs on texts by Alexandre Pushkin is a lovely example. The recording is late in Gedda's career, however, and his voice has the signs of a long life. It wavers somewhat in tone and pitch. It's a little sad when the great voices have passed their prime, but his native Russian language and his tremendous artistry are all there, and he provides a splendid version of these hard-to-find songs.I heartily recommend the album for voice study of the songs, as I'm using it. I wouldn't choose it for listening pleasure, with all due homage to Gedda, unless you don't mind some waver here and there. I would never say that singers should stop recording as their voices age. Their contributions are still priceless for those of us who follow in their footsteps."
2,"Interesting instruments, disappointing music","I had been drawn to this artist after hearing music of his backing a LVMH commercial played frequently on CNBC.Very beautiful, dense, atmospheric and melodic.This CD uses many guitar-like instruments that are unfamilar to my ears, which is interesting. However, I was expecting something very musical like the LVMH piece, but found more noodling than melody.Still, worth hearing for the instrumentation."
4,Love this album,Only gave 4 stars because half of the tracks are ho hum to me - but the half that is good is VERY GOOD. Amazing.
4,Another Good Band from England,"Kill II This is the most ""famous"" English metal Band with OMS and Earthtone 9. They play with famous US metal Bands like Anthrax,Stuck Mojo and Skinlab. This album is a mix of violence and electronics(samples) which can remember Fear Factory but in my opinion the band who inspire Kill II This is Machine Head (listen to the song ""figure of 8ight"") Songs of this album like G.od O.n D.rugs,This is the N.E.W.S. and Guided by Voices with their schizophrenic lyrics and music can represent the perfect soundtrack of the new millenium. If you want to listen an interesting group and a album with good innovations buy Trinity performed by Kill II This. P.S Another interesting information: Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory sings in a song of this album. Thanks."

4,U-Boat Operations Of the Second World War Volume 2: Career H,"Kenneth Wynn has written a well detailed highly informative book. It coves every U-boat from U-511-UIT25. This is the second Volume. The Mr. Wynn gives much of the technical data from each ship. When the Keel was laid, when the ship was launched and its history. Also what ever came of the ship. The history is one of the wonderful things that U-boat enthusiastic will love. If there is any U-boat and you want to know the dates, places and what and where they did, this book is the bible. One of the disapointing thing about the book was the lack of photos. It would have been nice to see some of the boats, especially after reading about some with a long history. But all and all this book is a MUST for people who are enthusiastic about U-boats"
1,Frustrated mom,"This product is very poorly made. Nearly from the beginning, the CD player was finicky, sometimes playing, sometimes not recognizing a CD (saying ""no disc""). Well, it went from finicky to worse. The cover doesn't close tight enough to play the CD. We would have to hold firm pressure on the lid to get the CD started and then if we let go, it would often stop playing. Our son has sensitive sleep habits, and messing up his music, was enough to mess up his sleep - very frustrating! Now, we have to keep a very tight rubber band on the CD lid to keep it working, but still is finicky. If I could return it I would. It makes me question buying RCA products!"
1,Terrible product...,I got this for the bedroom my boys share so they could each have their own alarm and because they love to listen to music at night while falling asleep. No matter which way I position the radio I cannot get any stations to come in clearly and the volume control has something wrong with it as well. If you tap on the top of the unit it will go from barely audible to blaring. Their CDs skip as well...what a piece of junk!
2,boxing it up,"I purchashed this radio because I needed to replace the one I got for my son 3 years ago when he was born. I like to play CD's for him at nap time and again before bed. This one was so compact and had all the features I was looking for including repeat play. I've tried three different CD's now and it is real touchy. Sometimes it will play, other times it skips for the duration the first 2 songs then plays fine or quits playing altogether. I'm very disappointed with it as I had done my research on all the features and this one was perfect. I guess next time I'll do research on reveiws as well. I also found it to be noisy as another reviewer mentioned."
2,unreliable alarm,"This alarm clock started off being a good alarm. I have used it for about 6 months and it hasn't performed as well as when I first bought it. The cd is supposed to continue where you left off the day before on the alarm function...this no longer works, it starts at the first of the cd. Some mornings the alarm never goes off, this has happened about 3 times in the last 2 months and is embarrasing when I'm late to work! The battery life has been fine, my kids unplugged it and it still went off the next morning, so that feature works.Because of me being late to work multiple times I have to give this alarm a poor review, hopefully this saves you some time and embarrasment."
2,don't waste your time,"Ever since I bought this alarm clock one year ago, I've hated it. It's features work fine. But, when the lights are out, the dim setting for the backlight is so dim you can't see the time. The high backlight setting is so bright you don't want to face it - it's very bright. I've tried putting things over the time - sheer fabric or paper - but it's still too bright, and disturbs my sleep. (I'm not a picky sleeper.) Many other reviewers I have read say the same thing - they couldn't solve the too bright/too dim dilemma. After one year of frustration, I'm buying a new alarm clock. This is a redundant product. Why would RCA make something so useless?"
1,not worth the money,"Had this product for 12 days before the time froze on on it and I was unable to change or use any buttons. I unplugged it and took the battery out, after I plugged it back in it lasted another 3 hours before it again stopped. I cannot use an alarm clock I can't trust. RCA gave me the runaround and would not help me. Although I would not trust another one of these, anyway. Time to go back to Sony!"
5,Super Product,"We got this same unit for my daughter's room before she was born, she is now almost 3 and we've had no problems with it at all - it's super, so we wanted the same exact one for our son's room. The clock has a brightness setting so when she was a baby we could dim it but now that she is scared of the dark she uses it as a night light as well. It's not too big and works super in her room! We tried ordering a Sony one that looked the same and we returned it right away because it was giant and looked ridiculous."
2,Sent it back,"I liked that this product had a duel alarm that you could choose a different wake up function for each of the alarms. However, I like to wake up to the radio and I couldn't get ONE radio station to come through. FM or AM. Maybe the product I received was faulty; I tried it in every corner of my bedroom and only got static. It went straight back, so I have nothing to say about any of the other functions because I didn't keep it long enough to try them out."
3,its alright,"this is ok for the purpose we needed it for. and its got a really nice look. but i'm just waiting for it to stop working. don't get me wrong, it works and all, but when it wants to."
5,great for kids interested in money,"This book is the perfect length for my 10yo who has a stock account and loves to learn about money, lots of info and pictures but enough length that at 10yo he is not bored. He reads at about 6th grade level, and this book is probably for 5th grade and up or would be too hard. Very nice illustrations/pictures with visual interest."
4,not bad,this a very cool single. i'm a huge fan of the bloodhound gang adn really like this song. the video was incredible and packed full of the comic laughter that the bloodhound gang usually brings. the cover by the Unband is pretty good also. the music video is basic but its still very cool. the trailer for scary movie is hilarious and makes you want to see the movie. buy this single. go buy Scary Movie and sit back and have an entertaining experience.
5,A Standard Of Excellence.,"I have nothing but the very highest praise for this CD, not only for the brilliant music and musicianship, but also for the quality of the reproduction."
2,The story ends HOW???,"Pleasant enough read, obviously a first novel from an author with considerable talent and potential.The story has some really good writing throughout, and creates the mood of war torn Europe very well. The details were convincing and seemed authentic.The ending really bothered me though. Without giving it away, I have to say that it was a complete surprise, and not one that left me feeling satisfied.I just didn't feel that the characters would accept that solution especially without any foreshadowing earlier in the story that this would be the way things would end. It reminded me of stories that end with ""suddenly Pascale and Witold woke up and realised the whole thing had all been a crazy dream"". I felt cheated.I enjoyed the book up to that point, and thought the characters and the story deserved better. I would like to see more from this author."
3,Beautifully Broken,These are beautiful glasses... unfortunately when I picked the package up from my porch I could hear them rattling around inside.Darnit! I opened the box and both glasses were completely shattered. I've submitted my replacement request to Amazon and hopefully after this second round around I'll be able to able drink some delicious drinks in these beautiful glasses!
2,thin and weak,these glasses are very thin i feel like im going to break them the instructions that came with the glasses even say use care when placing ice into the glass to avoid fracturing the inner layer buyer beware
1,Hesitant to buy more Bodum,"I purchased these in Dec2009, then excited about the ""no condensation"" concept. HOWEVER far too fragile, as others have also stated, and now I am super cautious with the one glass I have left. I do not like the fact that I have to be overly cautious with this item - especially since I purchased it with the assumption it would make my life easier. Glass is not covered under warranty @ Bodum. Definitely feel like I lost money. To be fair, I haven't tried other Bodum products but this experience makes me shy away from this brand."
5,The BEST beer glass for grown ups.,"I waited neary 2 years to write this review because I shattered 1 of my 2 glasses the first week. I dropped it about 3 inches when full....a fall that would not have broken most glasses. These are fragile, and I was concerned they were TOO fragile for regular use.HOWEVER, the second glass has lasted well and is like new with frequent use. As frequent as I drink beer that is (maybe 3 times a week) because it is the only glass I use.Its simple really, I am a beer nut, always trying new craft brews, and this is the only glass I own that lets me judge the color/carbonation/head and keeps the beer cold from first sip to last. I have been careful, and hand wash only.When this one dies, I will get another set and perhaps let a guest also enjoy the perfect beer experience. Highly recommended."
1,Pretty but ridiculously FRAGILE,"I have been very careful with these, yet have have broken two of four glasses purchased less than a year ago. The slightest knock (from ice or spoons) is apt to start cracks in the glass. The product ""Editor's Note"" now explains that the manufacturer warns of these risks. In my opinion, the strong likelihood of breakage from the most minor accident makes these glasses worthless."
2,Great glass but fragile,"This is a really great glass but very fragile. Broke two in less than a month through normal use. None of our other, ""regular"" glasses are as fragile."
3,Fragile....,"Beautiful, innovative, extremely fragile. Lost the first one 48 hours after opening the package. Borosilicate glass may well be tougher than normal glass, but these are still extremely thin. Our first breakage was from a minor impact too, just slowly tipped it over on the table."
5,Bodum canteen Double-Wall Cooler/Beer,"The Bodum concept is fantastic if you live in a warm, humid climate. Great for mint julips, gin tonics, iced tea and anything that sweats in the warm, humid air. Fantastic product!"
3,"Nice Glasses, but FRAGILE","My set of 2 is down to 1 with a slight tap on the sink while cleaning it -- just a note to others that these glasses are Extremely fragile. In my opinion, the glass should be thicker to allow for everyday bumps ...especially after you've had a few beers while watching the game."
4,great glasses bad customer service,The insulated glassed are great. The first shipment was poorly packed and two of the four glasses were broken. I returned the broken glassed and immediately received new unbroken glasses. Now a month later Amazon says I didn't return the glasses and there are going to double bill me.
1,Useless,"According to the Bodum website: ""Simply treat it as you would any glass product and it will stand up to every day use."" I have never had a glass break when I dropped an ice cube into it, as this one did. I had a set of two and was extra careful after the first one broke. The second one didn't survive much longer.These glasses are extremely fragile - virtually useless."
2,Good from far but far from GOOD,Cool idea (pun intended) BUT the glass is very thin. DON'T drop an ice cube in one it will break the glass!!!
2,"Great for beer, it's a piece if you put ice in it.","I put ice in my glass and it shattered the inner wall. I put the ice in by hand so it's not like the ice had far to fall. It went right through the bottom of the glass. A definite, never buy again."
5,Bodum Canteen Double-Wall Cooler/Beer Glasses,We own several other Bodum double walled products and have very happy with all of them. I surprised my husband with these and he's so thrilled to use them! HIs beer has never stayed colder! You can even put them in the dishwasher.
3,Glass broken,"We got the glasses when they were scheduled, and we really like the way they keep our ice water cold without sweating. However, one glass broke almost immediately despite the general care we use. The inside of the glass just shattered, as it was sitting on the counter. I know the glass was not dropped. We have never put them in the dishwasher. The remaining glasses are functioning as they were intended."
2,too bad!,"Unfortunately, these glasses really are as fragile as other reviewers have reported. In spite of the negative reviews, I ordered two sets, because I loved their shape and light-weight elegance. Even though I treated them gently, hand washing and drying, and slowly sliding ice cubes into them, the inside glass shattered. I ordered another brand of doubled walled glasses which are much more durable, so far!"
4,"Fantastic, for adults","I have 4 of the 13oz and 6 of the 6oz, and haven't managed to break one yet after six months. Of course I read the instructions and do hand wash them like most of my glasses.These are my favorite things to drink out of and I am buying more for entertaining. Not sure how one reviewer got water past the silicon valve. I use them coasterless on a glass coffee table with iced drinks. So treat them right and they will return the favor."
2,Very Fragile Even When Extreme Care is Taken,"I have bought several sizes of the Bodum glasses. They don't last very long. We gently hand wash and dry and pour liquid in first before adding ice. Even with all this care, the inner glass seems to be extremely fragile. I had one crack today when I put room temperature liquid in it and then added ice. Too bad. They are pretty. I think customers should be refunded for these as they are obviously flawed."
3,BEEEEE Careful,Glasses are nice but fragile. The claim of stronger due to no sodium content is not quite true. Ice cube broke one of mine.
3,13oz. Largest of the three glasses,"Wider/bigger circumference then expected. sz10 handsWhite product info and silicone seal on base, not shown in images (at time of purchase), is misleading, and irritating.They work perfectly though, no complaints there. And when full of something delicious you forget all about the glass, which is the point.Handle with care, they're fragile. (I'll miss my canteen carafe)"
5,Great Glasses,"These glasses are great! They're light weight, keep beverages cold (or hot), and they're glass. The only wish they were larger.I've read other comments about how they arrived broken, but mine were in tact and I haven't broken them yet."
2,Poor set of glasses,These are very unattractive light weight glasses which spot greatly when washed. Would not buy again.
5,Apparently not as fragile as I was told,"I love these glasses. I was a bit concerned about the fact that many reviews stated they are very fragile. While I must admit that I carefully wash them by hand and put them away immediately after every use, my brother knocked over his glass on our Corian countertop and it was no worse for the event. The beer does seem to stay colder longer, and they look beautiful full of my favorite ales."
2,too freakin' fragile,"let's be clear: these bodum glasses are things of beauty. but since since they're also drinking glasses, they're supposed to be practical. unfortunately, they are antyhing but. i stuck one under the thru-the-door ice dispenser of my fridge and the dropping cube cracked the glass. that just ain't right. save your money until bodum tells their glassblowers to thicken the bottom of their glasses. until then, these glasses just, well, blow."
1,TOO FRAGILE,These glasses are nice until you have to wash them. They break easily. They are extremely fragile. Far too thing for everyday wear. I will not order them again. I have broken two just by washing them..
1,Returning Broken Glasses for Credit,Why would anyone rate these glasses more than 1 star if Amazon is refusing to credit for those broken in shipment?
1,Should have read the reviews,"Lovely design but very fragile, mine broke 2 days after purchase, most of the glass was broken into big pieces but there was small ones too, I thought the more expensive a glass is the less shrapnel from its breaking, this one proves this theory wrong, perhaps cause of its very thin wallsI'm imagining it breaking in someone's mouth..scary!Anyways never again"
2,27 days after receiving the order one glass is in the garbage,"Yikes. I had no idea these glasses wouldn't even last one month before chips and cracks began to appear. I've already had to throw one glass away. They work for the purpose I bought them for: to keep my drink ice cold. Unfortunately it appears these glasses are not built for every day use/ all day use. If you want a nice glass to use for only certain occasions this glass will work well. If you want a glass to use every day and all day long, I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
5,Very pleased...,"I have had these glasses since Christmas, and so far I have no complaints. I like drinking tea out of the them since it retains the heat well. I hand-wash them as they are fragile, but I really love them so I don't mind!"
4,"They certainly work, but feel fragile","The double walls work very well, keeping your liquids hot or cold as promised and keeping moisture from building up outside the cup. My ONLY complaint is that they just feel fragile. Even though I haven't had one break, there is just something delicate about them that makes them a bit unappealing to handle. For instance, I am always very careful about dropping ice in them because it makes such a loud noise and the glass seems thin."
5,Best cups ever! Keeps ice frozen for 5+ hours,These are the best glasses ever! Not only are they light and beautifully designed but they keep your drinks COLD! But most of all their capability to keep ice frozen in your drink is remarkable. I was so sick of pouring a drink with ice and then 8 minutes later the ice has melted. With these glasses your ice literally stays frozen for 4+ hours. I would put ice in my coffee at work in the morning and 6 hours later my coworkers would marvel how the ice still hadn't melted since morning.
2,A Misleading Title,"Of the 4 books I have read dealing with ""day"" hiking, this one is the worst. First: it contains hikes that are far more difficult than what I was lead to believe by the word dayhike. Second: the maps of the hikes are very poorly illustrated. Third: the discription of the hikes themselves are lacking in any detail or directions. Fourth: the book contains only hikes in the area immediately around the town of Banff, and does not contain hikes in the entire Park of of Banff. I was very dissappointed in it."
5,A great introduction...,"I have to commend Nonesuch for releasing this excellent collection. It serves as a great introduction at a domestic price. There are several volumes of Takemitsu's film music available on Victor/Japan as well, but they'll set you back around 35 bucks each and the liner notes are in Japanese. I've acquired 6 volumes so far, and I recommend Vol. 4 as the most essential. It also happens to be on David Toop's list of desert island discs, if that means anything to you. Still, this Nonesuch sampling is the best place to start. I even prefer John Adams' more polished performance of Woman in the Dunes to the original (available on Vol. 4). The real highlight for me, however, was the London Sinfonietta darting through the Waltz from Face of Another, which appears again on Vol. 4 as a woman singing, accompanied by accordians and orchestra. You'll find yourself humming it for weeks."
1,Not As Described,"The item description says this has 1/2"" and 3/4"" knockouts. It only has 1/2"". There are three 1/2"" knockouts per side. I tried to return it, but refunds are not available on this item. If you need 1/2"" and 3/4"" go to Home Depot. They have it for less than two bucks each."
3,brian dawkins jersey,the jersey was reasonable in price.. however it wasn't exactly what i expected.. the iron on number look a little cheap.. i previously puchased one in green at the same price and the numbers had stitching around them.. good product.. delivered in timely manner..just good
1,Deceit,I purchased this text for a reading course taking her word for it when she wrote that there were few changes from the third to the fifth edition. Now I have to purchase another copy because my instructor wants us to read sections that are NOT in the third edition. Talk about frustrating! I certainly would NOT purchase anything from this person again. I don't like being lied to.
4,A very teacher-useful book...finally!,"After suffering through Lucy Calkins's huge book of little use and Donald Graves's dry meditations, I finally found a book that is worth saving after that graduate writing course is over. Tompkins devotes a good deal of time discussing the many types of expository writing and many genre studies, above and beyond the theories and ideas about setting up a writing workshop. The activities and examples are clear and useful, the diagrams terrific. Tompkins really knows how to write and, I assume, to teach. I will be using this book to teach graduate students of education and add its wonderful contents to my own repetoire of teaching tools in my 4th gr. classroom."
3,No CD included,"Be aware that if you purchase ""new"", you will not be receiving the CD that is supposed to accompany the text.I did receive the book quickly, and in new condition."
4,A toda Cuba le Gusta,"It is the perfect match of musicians and vocals. Incredible performance of Guaracha, Son, Danzón, Guateque, Descargas and other cuban rithms and musical expressions. Juan De Marco (leader of this ""wonderful musical get together"") leaves us product, not only full of music for our souls, but a beautiful cultural document of musical art for next generations. For a long time this kind of music had been undercovered (for some reason) for the rest of the world. Thanks to all members of Afro Cuban All Stars."
3,Not filling,"This CD has the names and the tunes. It could be a classic. Unfortunately, there is little new in it and it fails to transport the listener. In a way, it's like the all-star sports teams....So, if you own a dozen or so Cuban CD's from the Buena Vista alumni, save your money..."
5,A Nice Little Collection,"How much fun this one is. I'm normally not a big horn fan--the brass on most, if not all, of this list is razor sharp. I also liked the guitar work--definitely unexpected, but a pleasant surprise."
5,Needs more cowbell........,"This CD is lively, upbeat, and rockin'! A must have if you enjoy Cuban music. As one who has vistied Cuba, this CD takes me back to hanging out in dive bars, searching for great music, big bands, lively older musicians, and dancing in every available space in the club. Another Buena Vista Social Club Masterpiece.... fantastic! I'm running home to light up a Monte Cristo!"
4,MQadir,"Its the best fitting sofa cover I've ever owned. I think a two piece cover would have been better. no problem with bleeding on to clothes and I have a leather couch so no problems there either. Material is like velvet which was unexpected, but nice."
4,"Don't spend the extra money for the ""Bonus Holiday CD""","This isn't the most creative Curious George story, but what's not to like about Christmas and a monkey? There are no bonus episodes or extras on the disc, though, so the DVD ends up being a little pricey for 58 minutes of George.The bonus CD contains 9 absolutely unremarkable Christmas vocal standards:The twelve days of ChristmasWe wish you a merry ChristmasDeck the hallsHark! The herald angels singJoy to the worldJingle bellsSilent NightHere we come a-wassailingO come, all ye faithfulWindows Media Player identifies the disc as ""A Very Gilly Christmas"" by Saturday Night Live but, alas, that is incorrect.Pick up the DVD used and you'll be just fine."
4,Cute Movie,My little toddler is obsessed with Curious George on PBS. I thought he'd love this movie for Christmas but surprisingly he didn't really seem to care. The movie was cute though and worth the $10 since I couldn't ever find it anywhere other than Amazon.
5,Big fan!,"This is the movie to get you and your toddler in the Christmas spirit! It's a movie that leaves warm fuzzies in your heart. My daughter loves it and what's more important, I actually enjoy watching it with her, every day for a month!"
5,Wonderful holiday movie,This Christmas movie is very sweet and enjoyable. It has funny moments that kids will love and a nice story of friendship. It's appropriate for even the youngest viewers.
4,Curious george phase.,"This movie was perfect for a christmas gift for my son who was a huge CG fan for a long time. Although he liked the movie, he never asked to watch it by name. I guess Cars and Kung Fu Panda are hard to beat by a 2 1/2 year olds standards."
4,amazingly graphic game,"I love this game because lots of authenticty in it,but lacks real Civil War maps and You have to take turns between shooting which wouldn't happen in a real Civil War battle."
1,Very disappointing.,"Having grown up in Coney Island I found this effort to be extremely substandard. This book takes the most uninteresting pictures of the most uninteresting individuals that I can imagine. Mr. Stein would have done much better to find alot more of the old timers who truly represent the feel and atmosphere of What Coney Island was, not so much the depressing delapidated dangerous neighborhood that it most unfortunately has become. He did not look hard enough to find what is truly representative of the Coney of lore, because had he done so, it's still there, just difficult to unearth. The pictures of the parade just shows how far down Americas greatest playground has gone. Do yourselves a favor and go to the library and pick out any number of other books on Coney Island and then compare. Unfortunately, you might become meloncoly and saddened, for Coney is really just a microcosm of what has become of this nations great cities."
3,"Nice photos, not much history","I was disappointed in the book. Perhaps my expectations of the book were incorrect. I was expecting photos (and text) giving an historical account of Coney Island's past. Unfortunately, while the photos are nice, they are not dated or put in any kind of historical context. There is minimal text, and not much historical perspective.For someone looking for a book on photographic technique, and nice, artistic-like photos, this is probably a good book. But if you are expecting a history of Coney Island, you should look elsewhere."
1,As the other reviewer stated SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,Very dissappointed in this book. Save your money. Should have asked for my money back butI just gave it to the Goodwill. There are many other books on Coney Islandthat show the real one. This one does not.
1,Coney Island,"TERRIBLE!Save your money. Very little on the amusements. Instead, we get portrait-type photos of people that could be seen on any beach anywhere in the world. Who are these people? Who cares? Mis-titled, mis-conceived."
2,Not what I expected,Not the kind of book for indepth ownership. I found it of little use to the laymantrying to get into pigs.
4,off the map,"This is a very good book to me. Short concise tales of many different explorers. Has led me to other books about individual explorers that I found more to my interest that i wanted to learn about more indepthly, if that is a word."
3,Tough Call To Make,"CARMEL VALLEY RIDE is one of those CDs that's difficult to give an overall review of. There are a few tracks on this CD that individually are very good (especially COME BACK BABY),but collectively as a whole they just don't work together. The instrumentals are fairly good but Caroline Doctorow's vocal range is so narrow and high pitched on these recordings that by the sixth track it was having a laser beam effect on my ear drums. By the eight track I felt like I was shut in a room with a Rottweiler who has an obsessive-compulsive disorder centered around a squeaky-toy and is standing,with squeaky-toy in mouth, between me and the doorway. But I felt the same way about the one and only JEWEL CD I ever bought so to each their own!"
5,Bird Life in Wington,I read this book as a child and re-read it everytime I visited my grandmother's farm. It never fails to delight people of all ages in communicating the Christian based parables within it.I was sorry to see that it is no longer in print. It is timeless.
5,Beautiful,This is Placido Domingo at his best--singing love songs in his native language. Very romantic and beautiful songs.
4,GREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Great CD; A must in my book. I was in the music store in NYC, and just picked up ear phones and started listing. It was great and still great on my stereo. DON'T DELAY IN BUYING IT."
5,Jane strikes again with another winner,"If you spend and hour at the card shop looking for the appropriate sentiment for the sister who has NOT ""always been my best friend""...this offering from Jane Heller is for you. Once again Jane strikes with lighthearted honesty at the realities of relationships between women. And once again she hits the mark."
3,Not the best from Jane Heller,"Because it takes a lot for me to give on a book, I finished this one. I've read a few novels by Jane Heller now, and I'm seeing a pattern. This one was a very plot-driven novel, like all her other ones, and short on real character development once again. The speed of the plot kept me going through to the end, but I wouldn't recommend it."
3,An easy read!,"humorous, story about the relationship between two sisters that try to get along for their mother's sake. Good story, however I liked Name Dropping by this author better."
3,Sisters??,"When I got this book, I was under the impression that it would involve the sisters' relationship a little more than it did. The book was fast paced and humerous but lacking in...something. I dunno. And it was sort of weak, not much of a mystery-no surprise ending or surprise additions, it was basically predictable. Maybe it lacked reality a little, the way Deborah was trying to solve the case and the police were getting tips from HER. The book was well written and a quick read, but it just seemed to have nothing to do with the sister-sister relationship. And to be honest, if my sister acted the way Sharon did, and said the things she said, I would not want to talk to her either...ever. And in like the last chapter she decided to be nice, though she seemed to only be in a total of 5 chapters or something. I dunno. If you're looking for a very funny, quick mystery read, try Janet Evanovich. You'll love her!"
1,waste of time.,"I bought this book at the airport figuring it would be a quick and fun read. Well, I left it on the plane -- unfinished. I never expected a literary masterpiece but I did expect something fairly intelligent. The plot was contrived, and the characters were stupid and shallow. Not only was I annoyed with myself for spending money on this book, but I still had two hours to kill on the plane."
4,"Fun, entertaining read!","This is the first book I have read by Jane Heller, but I'm sure I will read more now. This is a good, quick read with a little bit of everything -- a good whodunit, romance, humor -- all the things I like in a book. Good job, Jane!"
4,Interesting stories,I enjoyed reading these stories and am amazed at the courage of women to accomplish so many things. If you are wanting some inspiration toward heading out on your own adventures this could be a good book for you.
3,Hip Hop Stars???,"Why is it that these people that make Cd's keep insulting our intelligence by titling Cd's one thing and then putting other types of music on them???...Jimmy Cliff is great, i love the song but it's not hip Hop...After 7 is real smooth and i love them but they're not Hip Hop...SWV really isn't Hip Hop either but they have a Hip Hop flava...on the flip side...Pharcyde's cut ""Passin' Me By""...dope song!...Mc Breed has a classic with ""Ain't No Future in your Frontin'""...""Tennsseee"" is a great song but not really Hip Hop either. Kid 'n Play is a good addition to this CD but it's still confusing why they put such a weird variety of different types of music on this CD. I could also do without ""2 legit 2 Quit!""...put one of Hammers great songs in instead. ABC is bubble gum Hip Hop and C+C Music factory is good dance music but NOT HIP HOP!!! Good CD but it's not a HIp Hop CD..."
3,"Adult learning; learning, psychology of; Netherlands.","This book deals with two concerns in particular: learning for life and the specific learning characteristics of adults. Parts 1-4 deal with adult learning, while the final3 sections of Part 5 tackle implications for policy and practice.Editors: A.C. Tuijnman is at the Department of Education, University of Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands. Max van der Kamp is at the Department of Pedagogy, Andragogy and Education, University of Groningen, The Netherlands."
3,Boiling In Oil...,"Interesting, the highlight of this album, for me, has always been ""Dying from the inside out."" Being a huge Husker fan as well as a fan of Mr. Mould the song was always the first one I skipped to when playing this disc. I once heard a critic (and I paraphrase here) describing this song as ""like listening to a man being boiling alive in oil"" and with this I agree. Cathartic in the extreme, and WAY out of place on an otherwise placid album, however... The song itself was the only reason I picked up the album....Michael Stipe was a close second."
3,understated drummer's album,"A bit of a mish-mash of shoegaze-y reverbed mellowness a la the Cocteau Twins, leavened with appearances by Bob Mould, Michael Stipe, and Richard Thompson.For a project that revolves around a drummer, rhythm seems decidedly understated. A pleasant enough listen, but nothing to pay big bucks for."
3,A mesmerizing fifty-minutes,"I followed the trail of Richard Thompson which led me straight to Drunk With Passion by the Golden Palominos. Richard is my Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for popular music - his presence on any recording is a stamp of artistic integrity. Drunk with Passion is a collection of dreamy slow-tempo songs with vocals by Amanda Kramer. Instead of the usual technique of mixing the solo vocals center-forward, Amanda's voice is buried in the mix and appears to come from all points. Her disembodied voice gives Drunk With Passion an eerie quality. `The Haunting,' `When The Kingdom Comes,' and `Hands Of Heaven' are favorites featuring the ghost of Amanda and Richard Thompson's delicate guitar work - the combination is hypnotic. Minor flaw: the screaming and chaotic `Dying From The Inside Out' spoils the relaxing mood set by the previous six compositions. It's out of place. That aside, Drunk With Passion is a mesmerizing fifty-minutes courtesy of the Golden Palominos."
3,"Decent, but not the best of Hall","Hard Aground is one of James W. Hall's typical mysteries set in South Florida, Miami in this case, and has a century-old mystery that ties into the current time period. Rich with Miami history and a lot of the controversy over history versus development, the story unwinds in a straight-forward manner, with a fairly interesting set of characters that might seem a bit out of the ""normal"" world -- unless you live in South Florida. It's easy to identify with this set of characters, their feelings and desires, although some are more plastic than others and none are truly endearing.I won't recommend this as the best of Hall, but it still is a pretty good read. Without the twists and surprises of more sophisticated tales, the book is fine as a hammock companion, but not the type to win a major award. Hall definitely improves in the later books he's written, so don't make this your first choice of James W. Hall material."
3,Good storyline,Good storyline but characters lack development. Not on a Carl Hiaasen level of Florida craziness. Still enjoyed the historical aspect of the story.
4,strong early Hall novel,"This one was very good, nearly worthy of 5 stars, but I held back simply because I read it too many years ago and details are fuzzy. This one of the first novels I ready by James W. Hall and I was so impressed that I started reading more of them. Really, they've all been good to great, either the novels with the Thorn character or other one-off titles like this one. The main character in this novel, Hap Tyler, is a kindred spirit to Thorn, sharing the same independent nature and headstrong way of doing things. This novel also excels at the sense of place that Hall envokes, that being the environs of Miami in this case. As usual, vivid characters and punchy dialogue help to keep those pages turning. Another winner."
5,Dessert Bowls,This 10-ounce dessert bowl perfectly compliments the Secret Garden dishes. It is lightweight and very durable. Perfect for a snack or special dessert.
3,Good Try,"This is an album that should haven been two albums. One with all the single versions and more special another with all twelve-inch versions. A lot of good tracks in their extended form are missing: Sounds Like a Melody, Big In Japan (the original 12"") and Jet-Set. Stil worth buying, but could haven been much better."
3,Upbeat,"This album wasn't so bad. The fact that I was more interested in the synthesizers than the singers said a lot about it. I love 80's music, but this group seeeemed to be unimaginative. (Just look at the titles of the songs. Their are 10 tracks, but only...what, 3 songs! ) I wouldn't buy this unless I was having a crazy 80's party."
5,Likable and Honest,"The characters of this book are clear and believable, the trials they go through and the effort they put forth to 'push the inside beauty out' makes this novel a worthwhile read."
2,Not a feeder for hummers,"What I received were two Oriole feeders that are not appropriate for hummers as the distance from perch to feeding hole is too long for hummingbirds. Naturally, I am disappointed because this summer I've had problems with ants and bees invading my hummingbird feeders. What I thought I ordered was supposed to solve that problem so the hummers could feed in peace. Not the case."
3,Good for some chuckles,"I read this book while pulling guard duty over night, and it kept me amused for quite awhile. I went ahead and ignored the authors advice, and just read it straight through. Inside were many interesting stories, divided into confirmed, unconfirmed and urban legend. All of the stories relate, of course, to the darwin awards. The basic premise of the Darwin Awards, for anyone whose been on an island with Richard Hatch, is that it's a dubious award given to those who improve the gene pool by removing themselves from it in the most laughable and idiotic fashions."
5,Darwin Wins in THE END...,"Having read this book from cover to cover, it's perfect for both leaving on a coffee table or just in the ""reading"" room. Mine is located somewhere between the bathroom and the computer room as I keep re-reading it for inspiration.The book has hundreds of humorous accounts about creative people that have met their most demise in some of the most idiotic approaches. Being one who almost earned an award myself (308), I find that it is far better to laugh and learn about how not to do something creative than to boldly go forth and learn nothing from the errors of others. Thus, for all other creative nuts out there besides me, I recommend this book, for it gives insight as to how a small spark of genius can backfire (or just plain explode), and take you with it."
2,High in Potential... Low in Execution,"I have read many an email about a new Darwin Award winner and was really looking forward to this anthology of Darwin Award winners.But, a clunky writing style and an amateurish attempt by an apparent first time editor made this material hard to read in a 300 page book format. Add to that the rather low ratio of truly humorous stories and you have a poorly executed effort.The second star is for the content that IS truly humorous and will get you rolling every once in a while. This would make an okay bathroom book... but wait for paperback and the smaller price tag.>>>>>>><<<<<<<A Guide to my Book Rating System:1 star = The wood pulp would have been better utilized as toilet paper.2 stars = Don't bother, clean your bathroom instead.3 stars = Wasn't a waste of time, but it was time wasted.4 stars = Good book, but not life altering.5 stars = This book changed my world in at least some small way."
3,No substitute for wit.,"The actual stories are 'amusing', very much like the old Fortean Times 'Strange Deaths' section.The disturbing thing is that the collection is delivered in a supercilious and deeply banal commentary - Wendy is no Oscar Wilde.We K N O W these people are making mistakes...!It all comes accross like an undignified child, sniggering and pointing a finger at an afflicted wretch.There is also a strange attempt to turn the 'Darwin Awards' into some kind of phenomenon, as if it were somehow more important than the stories it collects."
5,Hilarious,"Ok, i've read the reviews from the people who think this book is horrible. I read at least five of these stories a day and I find them amusing. The stories are hilarious and most of them are true. One nice thing is the stories that are not true have the heading ""Urban Legend"". And even these stories are true but there are so many variations on the Internet that story in the book may not be 100% accurate. The stories are packed with laughs,and lessons. One lesson is, never check the barrel of a muzzle-loading rifle with a bic lighter. I encourage anyone who loves to laugh to buy this book. If you think it is evil to laugh at dead people think of it this way, you're not laughing at them, you're laughing at how they died. So buy this book, I promise that you will love it."
4,"Some funny, mostly pathetic","Why do we have to gawk at accident scenes? This book appeals to a person's morbid curiosity. The writing is humorous, it is a quick read."
1,Huh?,"I must admit I misunderstood what this book was about. There isn't anything funny about people dying, regardless of the circumstances. The truth is, we're all ""stupid"". The only difference between us and them is that it cost them their lives, they will have no more tomorrows, and their families and freinds will have to deal with it. I tried to give it zero stars, but the system wouldn't let me.Besides, the author seriously seems to believe that man ""evolved from apes"", or that evolution is even possible. (think about it)."
2,People are stupid. I don't need a book to tell me,"OK, hearing about one of the Darwin Award winners can be funny.But there's only so much stupidity I can take at once.My biggest problem with the book was that the WRITING wasn't funny. Too ""just the facts"" oriented to be entertaining."
4,This is either hilarious or sickening.,"For those that enjoy macabre humor and find strange-but-true stories interesting, this book is indispensible. Otherwise, it depends upon whether you find the death of the fish farmer who harvests his fish by running electric current through his man-made pond, then wades into said pond before shutting off the current, or the energy plant employee who uses an coal furnace's conveyor as an exercise treadmill, as humouous or disgusting.One criticism: A sentence on the inside of the dust jacket mentions a story of a terrorist who opens, and detonates, his own mail bomb, after it was returned to him for insufficient postage. Although this story has been circulating the internet for some time (enter ""Khay Rahmajet,"" the guy's name, on a search engine), it appears nowhere else in the book."
3,The 'dumb' gene is universal,"A good book for those low self-esteem days where reassurance there will always be somebody with less common sense is the best prescription...or at least there used to be someone. Best appreciated if read over an extended span. As indicated by the repetitive irrational choices of the honorees, the urgency to finish quickly is not necessarily the optimum course of action.Besides, after scanning a large group of these accounts at one time, you might begin to contemplate your personal values, which pretty much takes you back to where you started."
3,Guilty pleasure at best,"Coming from a family with a huge tendency towards schadenfreude, I thought this would be our kind of book. It is, but it's not a guiltless pleasure. I don't want people to DIE for their mistakes, for children to lose parents, wives to lose husbands (most of the Darwin Award winners are male). My humanity interfered with me totally enjoying this book. It made me sad. But my brother will love it; I'm sending it to him."
1,As funny as a car wreck,"Stories of people killing themselves through carelessness is hardly an uplifting subject. What's required is a humorous slant to make an otherwise morbid subject entertaining. Unfortunately, this book lacks almost any trace of wit or insight and the treatment of its subjects is dry and even clinical. Don't get me wrong -- I'm all for laughing at the foibles and frailties (i.e., stupidity) of my fellow man. But pretty quickly into this book, you may find yourself wishing you had some Prozac. If you're the type of person who finds the obituaries section of your newspaper hilarious, you'll love this book. Otherwise you may want to pass."
2,Mean-spirited,This book is salt on the wounds of bereaved families. I don't think this book is a great book. I don't think there is kindness or humility in this book. You can decide on that. What I want to say is this book is salt on the wounds of bereaved families.
2,Weak but still freakishly compelling,"Okay, the Darwin Awards are a dubious notion at best, and this book reads like a collection of wildly divergent, unconnected brief tales which often -- but not always -- come to a morbid conclusion. Most have no more detail than a newspaper clipping, which is generally their source. As anything more than a way to pass the time, this collection is worthless.But as time-passers go, you could do a lot worse. I found myself barely able to put the book down as I scanned entries, hoping and expecting that the next tale would be more interesting than the stupid one I just read. I was rewarded just enough to keep me coming back for more. This book is in the tradition of those odd ""Best worst and most unusual"" and ""Panati's beginnings/endings of things"" that kept me up late nights during my early teen years."
2,Just plain unfunny.,"Humor is a totally subjective thing, of course. For instance, I love the Onion, the Simpsons, Buster Keaton, and ""A Confederacy of Dunces."" If you're not familiar, I'll just let you know that that's quite a range. The Darwin Awards was not funny to me at all. There were some bizarre stories, but I couldn't help feeling that the book was supposed to be a humorous one, and it failed miserably. The stories are like clinically-told jokes, which just doesn't work. Too bad."
4,A chuckle a page,"It's a wonder there's anybody left on planet earth after Wendy Northcutt has finished. The Darwin Awards honour those amazing people who, by their own stupidity, eliminate themselves from the gene pool. And Wendy Northcutt tells us how - like the Palestinian terrorists who refused to live on Zionist time so kept their clocks on Daylight Saving Time after Israel had reverted to Standard Time. The bombs were prepared but, when the terrorist drivers entered Israel, they reset their watches to match Israeli time. BOOM, the cars were still en route when the devices exploded.This is an excellent book to be takem a bit at a time. Mine lives in the bathroom so that the few necessary minutes spent there are done so with a contented smile on my face!"
4,"Sick, sick, sick... loved it!","Although I can't get my brain around the logic required to support an anti-procreation gene, this book makes me wonder. I'm a lot more careful around vending machines, electrical current, wild animals, weather balloons, and automobiles than I used to be, that's for sure! And now I know better than to break into anyone's house by wrapping a light jacket around my arm and throwing a manly haymaker into a glass door. Be warned-- this book is so funny you can read too much of it at once, and you'll temporarily numb yourself to the humor. Also, resist taking it to the coffee shop if you're self-conscious about people staring when you laugh so hard. (Anyone brave enough to ask you what's so funny will probably smile politely, then back away from you very slowly, when you tell them.)If you don't ever find death or stupidity funny, then this book is not for you. Otherwise, the combination will keep you entertained for quite a while."
3,"So much stupidity, so little time","While the idea of publishing approximately 300 short anecdotes about terminal stupidity sounds like it could be entertaining, in actuality most of the stories in this book are not all that funny. Yes, they make you shake your head and think ""Boy, that guy must have been really stupid,"" but they're not laugh-out-loud funny. This book would work well as reading material in a doctor's office or barbershop, where you could use it to pass time waiting for service, but it's not really worth reading in its entirety. (The funniest story, IMHO, is ""Misadventure at the Metallica Concert"" - page 155. Unlike most of the entries, it is rich in detail. It is labeled as an Urban Legend - meaning, it probably never actually happened.)"
1,Don't waste your money...........,"Buy the first edition of the Darwin Awards because it is hilarious and a page turner..............don't waste your money on this edition though. It's like the good ""Darwinians"" have all done themselves in and the author's scraping up stories to cash in on the ""Award"" trend. There are less than a half dozen 'tell around the water cooler' stories to share. Even at a used book price, it's not worth it."
2,dark humor but gives you stories to talk about at parties,At first I thought this book was going to be very funny. Or at least give me stories to share with my friends. The book even warns in the beginning not to read it like a regular book but rather to read a story here and there. So at first it was interesting to see how people do stupid things but after a while it got dark and depressing because everyone in the book must die of their stupidity to be eligiable for the book. The book was good in the way that it verified all stories so you know they are true. But this book is not for the faint at heart. This book would be great for that family member that we all have who has that dark cynical quirky sense of humor. Well I hope we all have one and I am not the only one who has one lol. It did give me some stories to tell at parties and social occasions.
3,Depressing,"I was rather disappointed by this book. It's simply a litany of idiots offing themselves. I'm grateful they did it before spawning, but I soon came to realize that, as often as not, they're endangering non-morons like you and I (well, maybe not you) while spectacularly entering the pages of this book.I suppose it's not the book's fault. It simply drew my attention to the dangers inherent in sharing a world with people capable of blowing themselves up with bug spray."
1,Utterly horrid!,"This book not only showed how horrid and condescending an author can be, but how to make your reader SNORE. I felt that Wendy Northcutt's writing was trivial, and dull. She not only pushed her idea that fools should not be allowed to live through darwins discovery of natural selection. I'm still confused at how Wendy Northcutt survived as a writer, i had figured there would be natrual selection when it came to writers. Sadly her and her writing has not been killed off, yet. Not funny, and a book only to fill one with scorn."
1,A stupid book about stupid people,Too little book for too much money. Previous reviewers were correct that this is a poorly written and skimpy book. If it wasn't a gift I would send it back. It's sad that the author ditched all her training for this crude attempt at humour. It doesn't appear that she went to any of the locations to interview anybody.
1,Liz speaks out,"If there were a zero on your scale, I would have given The Darwin Awards a zero. One (1) is too generous. This book is a disgrace and reveals that the author is not highly evolved herself. Where's the compassion? Where's the love for others? Where is even a smidgen of human kindness in this book? Ignorance, even stupidity, are not funny. They are tragic. Misfortune is not funny. Nothing about this book was the least bit amusing. Northcutt should have waited a few years to write a book, should have given herself time to mature and evolve. She would have written a totally different book."
3,the problem w/ Amazon,"quoting another reviewer:""Funny book, except the author is obviously biased against men. It doesn't take much research to turn up the fact that women are much stupider (in general) when it comes to basic common sense stuff.""The problem w/ Amazon.com reviews (and the rest of the internet for that matter) is that it gives a voice to anyone that can write, even people who are completley ignorant."
1,Nothing to do with natural selection,"It's amusing to read the assertion that conscientious objectors of the Darwin Awards just don't appreciate, or just can't handle the implications of science: these science-minded DA defenders apparently don't understand that a handful of random & accidental deaths have no effect on the fitness of a species.The Darwin Awards are a pseudo-scientific excuse for the callous to profit from the tragedies of the unfortunate by marketing to the smug and self-satisfied."
3,Good little torch,"This torch works well for both heat shrink and soldering.I would recommend this unit when working with 10 ga. (and smaller) wire and heat shrink.Warning: All of the tips shown in the photo are not included. You get: one soldering tip, one hot air tip and the heat shrink attachment only. Read the description!"
1,"Seriously, avoid this game like the bubonic plague, complete game-stopping crash on level 9.","No joke, SNK Playmore had acknowledged this bug a week ago and on that date they posted on the company forums, ""We're looking into it."" No response since. No update. My guess is this will wind up like Sudoku on the PSP (which had a bug where if you dropped below 80% power the game would pause every 30 seconds). They just swept that under the rug and said, ""Well, they can't all be winners."" I am expecting we will never hear any response on this issue from SNK and it will fall on the retailer's shoulders to supply refunds.Bad, bad idea to get this game."
3,Good lounge music in a Cuban style,"I listened to several cuts in a store listening station and I was very impressed with Mr. Gonzalez's skill and taste. However, to this gringo's ears this was basically very conservative hotel lounge music. I might still get it though I prefer latin jazz, cubop."
3,This is NOT a 5 star album!,"While this is a fine album, it does NOT deserve 5 stars. If you want an album by somebody who is in his 70s, this will do. If you want an album by a Cuban, because of the political situation, or whatever, this will do. If you want a 5 star album, this will NOT do. The album lacks any real development of a theme or concept, lyrical or melodic, and sometimes degenerates into a series of meaningless quotes of various styles to no end effect. This is not to say that the album does not have it's moments. It's just NOT 5 stars."
3,Not Anywhere Near Buena Vista Quality,"I loved Buena Vista, so I bought this CD. Well, without Ry Cooder these musicians are not doing too well. Perhaps it is not such an accident they were forgotten for so many years. This CD has nothing like Buena Vista tension and electricity, it meanders. If I could have, I would have returned it. Sorry."
5,This is piano playing at its very best....****,Anybody interested in piano music MUST have this CD in his/her collection. The sound is brilliant and the poetry behind the music is truly enchanting.
5,A rare gift from a national treasure.,"This is a beautiful, lyrical, enchanting album that can be listened to on many levels. For setting a relaxed, upbeat sunny weekend mood, this is a lovely choice. For deeper reflection, Gonzales' effortless phrasing and rhythmic playfullness are near awe-inspiring. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't love this wonderful masterwork."
5,A must buy for anyone that likes Cuban music,"A friend introduced me to this CD and I think I might wear it out. Three of the songs are his own compositions, while the rest of the songs are Cuban favorites. Ruben approaches these these pieces with a unique light and and lively style. The music is infectious and makes you want to get up and dance.There is a nice variety. Unlike with some folk music where after you've heard a few songs it starts to sound the same--each song here is a gem of its own. This is one of those CDs where you will like every song."
3,You will enjoy this book IF...,"You will like this book:*If you have not read too many other of Burroughs' books (some of the life details get repetitive)*If you appreciate a cynical outlook and a dry sense of humor*If you can handle raw, sometimes harsh details*If you are alright reading about gay relationships and a few intimate details*If you are moved by an honest struggle with addiction in life and want to get a glimpse of that struggle*If you are not looking for flowery prose, but prefer direct, easy to read material that flows and doesn't linger on any one part of his life too much.I started to give this book 4 stars, wanted to give it 3.5 (not an option) and settled on 3. It's a good, easy read - interesting and pointed. The reason I settled on 3 instead of 4 stars is that too much cynical gets tiring even for a cynical person. It is a rather dark read with some humor in the honesty of his arrogance and pride. Definitely a 3 1/2 star book."
5,Fantastic read,"My daughter turned me on to Augusten Burroughs, I have read all his books, his wit in the face of such trauma is amazing."
5,"you can stop drinking, but don't ever stop writing","environment? genetics? nature VS nurture? whatever the root cause, we see mr. burroughs hit rock bottom nearly 20 years before most alcoholics realize their drinking has become problematic. those who have been in recovery and those who have worked with those recovering will be both entertained and educated about the recovery process. its not a short journey and its not a pretty sight. mr. burroughs once stated he would write a book every year until the public grew sick of it. well, keep them coming, sir. they are brilliant and needed!"
3,Not as good as Running With Scissorts.,"I have to say that halfway through this I got bored. Running With Scissors kept me going because 'things we're always happening/changing.' This was pretty much just about being in AA, drinking, trying to deal with relationships, more drinking...oh, and then more drinking. I think this could of been a shorter book. I love Mr. Burroughs work, I just didn't think this was worth all the hype. Not to worry, I am still a fan."
2,Didn't like this book much,"A friend left this book with me, and I read it in 2 nights. It creates a one dimensional portrayal of recovery and of rehab. There's a lot of potential for truth in the book, and very little follow through to it."
3,Typical recovery memior,"I had read the first part of the authors book 'Running with Scissors' and found it hiliarous. However, 'Dry' was good, but not very exciting. It was like other books that I have read on the road to 'recovery'."
2,Dissapointing,Others have said it well....after the rehab section this book falls totally flat. It's just not interesting.
2,It just stopped feeling credible half way through.,The extras started to read like an all male episode of Sex in the City. Stopped giving a good bm about anyone in the book.Just came back to this review and dropped it another star. Tried finishing. Started to read live a made for TV screenplay. Ug.
5,Fabulous,"Augusten Burroughs is a testiment to the human spirit. His honesty and amazing wit are what make his books so special and DRY is no exception. This is an honest look at addiction, personel struggle and sobriety done with just the right amount of warped humor."
2,Obnoxious and Pointless...,"It was an interesting read at first, but later on, I was disappointed with the writer's anti-Semitic remarks and his degrading language against other cultures and faiths. Not to mention the unnecessary chapters of erotica. I was looking for something inspiring and motivating, unfortunately, this was the wrong book."
1,A memoir indeed,"One of the effects of alcholism is poor memory. ""Dry"" proves this if nothing else. Augusten's disease impacted more lives negatively than he knows and has chosen to ignore facts. This book is fiction so do not fooled by the titled. Even his nameis an illusion. Keep this in mind as you turn the pages that the truth is somewhere outside the cover."
1,A Disappointing Follow-Up to Running with Scissors,"Fans of Augusten Burroughs's Running with Scissors might want to think twice before purchasing this shallow, cliche-ridden, overly novelistic recovery memoir. It lacks nearly every quality that made Running with Scissors such a funny and life-affirming read."
1,All dryed up,"After not enjoying running with scissors at all, I decided to try one other book of mr. burroughs before writing him off. This book is a lot more enjoyable, and 'lite', but its candy for the brain. Again I just could not find Augusten likeable, almost vital for a memoir, and though he is significantly older in this book, he still seems to carry the same baggage with him. There is a certain cruelty when Augusten describes other people besides himself, so my sympathy for his plight diminished very quickly.Not recommended."
3,obsessed with homosexuality,"The horrors of alcoholism grab the reader. But again, like Running with Scissors, the author is obsessed with the fact that he is gay. If he were writing a book about sexuality, then it's acceptable. I wouldn't read it, because I really detest reading about someone's sexuality. However, I read this book because I thought it would be a memoir on alcoholism, just as I hoped his previous book would be a memoir on mental illness. Instead, he glosses over the real problems and focuses on the fact that he is gay and kinky. Who cares? It is a decent read but I recommend the movie Bill W over this for those who want to understand this awful condition."
5,Raw,"I loved this book. My coworkers and I used to trade books and one week this book dropped in my lap. I love it, I am putting on my kindle to read again. He lives this double life and he knows it, yet struggles to keep his worlds separate."
3,Ehhh,"Not sure what I was expecting... I loved Running with Scissors. I felt like the story ended too soon and was left wanting more. He describes the rehab facility well, but I could have learned about more of the characters and others involved."
5,"More, please!","I *loved* this book and I think the reason is because Burroughs has this amazing ability to transform you to a place where you feel as though you are actually living his experiences. I thoroughly enjoy his writing style, his sense of irony, the inner workings of his mind, etc, etc.As far as humor goes, I saw this book as a great deal more serious and somewhat melancholy than ""Running with Scissors"". Burroughs takes you from the shallow office politics of his job down to the depths of crack/alcohol addiction and loss and back again. It was an amazing journey from an amazing writer."
4,"No Scissors, but still sharp!","Not as nearly as good as Running with Scissors, but nonetheless a good read."
5,Wow...what a ride!,"I am an addict in recovery...and this book hits so close to home, I laughed, I cried, I went to a meeting. Thank you, thank you, thank you Augusten. Your ""story"" rocks!"
5,I walked a mile or two in his shoes,"I ordered my copy ofDry: A Memoirthe day after I finishedRunning with Scissors: A Memoir. I'm hooked on Burroughs' writings as I have walked a few miles parallel to his. I applauded his success despite his denial, and in the book laughed and cried as he put to words some of my very own feelings when dealing with coworkers, clients, figures of authority, and even friends. But despite my stellar 5 star rating one simply cannot appreciate what I am saying without the experience of reading it yourself. Well done, quick and easy read, and it leaves me yearning for more of a peek in the window of his life. It appears he's overcome some serious obstacles and is doing just fine! As soon as I finish all his works, I'll be reading his Brother's bookLook Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger'sand to plug one more work that I've added to my list of ""yet to read and will"" isRockstarlet"
5,Couldn't put this book down!,"The author makes you feel as if you are actually with him, sensing all of the things he writes about. This is the first of Burroughs' books I've read. I can't wait to read the others!"
3,His Best!,"I really enjoyed this memoir - much more than I originally expected to, considering how much I disliked _Running With Scissors_. It was much more emotional and Burrough's ego played a much smaller role than his previous books. Mostly, this felt more honest. It didn't try to be too funny either - though there were a couple of witty lines. I think I liked this more than _Magical Thinking_, making this the strongest book by him that I have read. I also liked the overall coherence of this book and that it was not a collection of disjointed essays."
4,Recovery made real,"After reading ""Running with Scissors"" I knew Augusten Burroghs had ""something"", but I wasn't sure what it was. Now that I've read ""Dry"" I think I know what it is. A gift for storytelling. It's easy to miss that in a memoir. Granted, Burroughs has had a fascinating (in a train-wreck sort of way)life to work with, but not everyone can repeat the fascinating and still make it entertaining. He certainly can! And given his somewhat acerbic style, I never expected to actually cry during the telling of his friend Pighead's dying. And yet I did, and was deeply moved. Although I couldn't tell you exactly why, which may be the real genius of Burroughs'writing...it's indefinable. I highly recommned this book, particularly for people in any kind of ""recovery""."
5,Brutally honest and very funny...,"I liked Burrough's previous book, RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, but DRY is truly a masterpiece. His candor, honestly and humor made his journey to sobriety a wonderful, enlightening experience. Bravo, Augusten!"
4,"Really, really honest",I am amazed at the brutal honesty that Augusten Burroughs possesses to write a second book on his painful past. He writes with such pathos and truth and humor that it feels like he is sitting next to you retelling his struggles. Dry is a testament to human strength and perserverance.
3,A Different Take on Recovery,"I like Augusten Burrough's writing style, he is witty and sarcastic, and this gives a unique twist to the genre of alcoholic/recovery memoirs. Burroughs writes about his forced entry into rehab, his time spent sober, and a relapse.The tone is light, but unfortunately I felt it was a little too light for most of the subject matter in the book. At times I felt like he was going a little too far in mocking some of the people and situations that he dealt with. There is a sub-story about his relationship with a good friend who is dying, and in that story Burroughs relates how he can't be there for this friend because it would hurt himself too much, and I get the feeling that he's doing that with this book--making light of his own serious issues because he's afraid to face it.That being said, the book is entertaining and I enjoyed reading it."
5,Hilarious.,"This was an extremely interesting book that made me laugh out loud more times than I could count. What more could you ask for in a book? :) If you haven't read ""Running With Scissors"" yet, read that first and then pick up this one. You won't be sorry."
5,Excellent story telling,At times hysterically funny and at other times tremendously sad. I found pieces of myself throughout the book and could relate on a lot of levels. great story
5,Touching and genuine.,"What I love about Burroughs is that he shows the reader all of his dirty laundry. Nothing in his life is left out, nothing is too embarrassing or sacred to be left out of his works. It is this sense of audaciousness that allows the reader to become intimate with not only Burroughs but everyone in the book.After reading ""Dry"", I felt as though I was privy to someone else's life. It was as though my best friend had told me a secret that was powerful, dramatic and shocking. ""Dry"" is an amazing narrative that will make the reader laugh, cry and wish that they could give the author a comforting hug."
4,"a great book, if not a little dry","This book is fabulous, I love how Augusten really brings you into his life. I have to meet him...and I want to see his friend's gift with my own eyes, if he really did receive such a gift (don't want to spoil it for potential readers). Much easier to digest than Running with scissors, but not quite as funny. I'm just glad Augusten is still with us, and hope to read more of his adventures in the future. Thanks for sharing your heart with us!"
3,Depressing yet amusing,"I don't drink, so it was difficult for me to fully comprehend all the ""experiences"" of an alcoholic. However, the witicism and humor were enjoyable."
5,Hilarious Tragedy,"This books hits very close to home, even though Augusten is a generation younger, his battle with the bottle was very like mine. Unfortunately, mine wasn't nearly as hilarious as his--so hilarious in fact that my only quibble with the book is that it makes drinking sound so glamorous and seductive that people might want to drink themselves silly every night just to experience the congenial gay bootcamp experience of the Proud Institute. The writing is consistently brilliant and laugh-out-loud funny, as well as a convincing cautionary tale about the dangers of self-delusion and (its twin sister) self-loathing."
5,Anything but Dry,"Quite an amazing document which allows the non-substance abuser to see what it's really like to become a slave to an addiction. Burroughs magnificently walks the line between heartbreaking and hilarious while never losing a clear-eyed perspective on his situation. Incredibly moving and most highly recommended, this is another on my list of underrated books."
4,Good book,"Even if your not a recovering alcoholic this book is still fun to read. His take on the world is very light, not a lot of dark parts in this book, as would be expected."
4,Had me riveted,"Augusten's memoir dry is direct, honest and easy to read.He details his life as an alcoholic prior to rehab, during rehab and the turmoil that follows. I found is fascinating (as I usually do with non-fiction pieces) and this one is particular is well written, thorough and somewhat inspirational.I have one small criticism though, the ending was a little rushed (hence my only giving it 4 stars and not 5). But I would definitely recommend this read to anyone with a similar taste in books as me."
5,Too Funny!,"It almost made me quit drinking, almost. Burroughs does it again. Incredibly gripping journey along the road of addiction. If I had his childhood (Read Running with Scissors), I might have ended up the same way. I laughed, I cried, but mostly I laughed. In fact, I borrowed it from a friend and never returned it!"
5,What a Book!,"Dry, is Augusten Burroughs funny, YES, funny, does he make it? memoir about addictions, and wrestling with ""kicking his alcoholism"" Burroughs is direct, interesting, funny, candid, and quite a personality. I found myself ""waiting"" for him to fall off the wagon, and hoping fervently that he made it through. I rooted for him on every page, and came to really care about this author, and read this book in 3 evenings. Great book, a true slice of an alcoholics struggles, in life."
2,more of a soap opera than a memoir about drying out...,"I don't understand all the raves for this book. I read and enjoyed ""Running with Scissors"" and the 1st half of ""Dry"" but let's face it, Augusten Burroughs is no David Sedaris. The descriptions of his adventures in rehab are entertaining but he seems to get back his sobriety a bit too handily. Also once he gets out of rehab, this is where the book totally lost me. If I wanted a romance novel about hooking up in NYC, I would have bought one. I mean come on, when he and Foster are cuddling - blech (and to quote Sienfeld ""Not that there's anything wrong with that!""). One more thing, the guy definitely has a high opinion of himself. OK, Auggie, you make a lot of money, are really cute and have a great body. Now write something interesting for God's sake."
3,Drunk Tales are Too Much the Same,"I really enjoyed reading Running with Scissors, unfortunately I feel a little disappointed by Dry. I've heard many of what people in AA call ""drunkalogues"", and I've read many books and seen many movies that show the depravity of alcoholism and addiction. After a while the stories have a sameness that is boring. Unfortunately, Dry barely rises to the level of being better than a drunkalogue. The end of the book is affecting, Burroughs is a funny writer and much of the book is entertaining, but the story just isn't that interesting, and the book didn't leave me feeling that the insight the author acquired was all that deep."
1,One Star is Way Too Generous,I can't believe this home video was marketed as a professional film. The cover art probably cost more than the entire film. It is obvious that the film maker (and I use that word loosely)knew he could reach his target audience with a hunky bare-chested photo on the box. Thank goodness I only rented this monstrosity otherwise I would be feeling really cheated.
1,Why?,"This has to be the worst film made in history. It wasn't bad enough that the cinematography was not up to par, but the script is horrible. The dialogue between the characters seemed forced, and the situations they go through are more cliché than real life; it stems around the director's/writer's/producer's/caterer's/whatever else he wanted to be in the movie's stereotypical views of homosexuality. The actors really seemed like they had just been picked up off the street, and given $50.00 to say some lines. I do not recommend this movie at all!!!"
1,Please don't waste your money,This is the worst film/DVD I have seen or purchased. I believe Amazon should stop stocking this item. It is truely dreadful.
1,How bad can a film be.........answer: very bad,"Bad acting, bad history, bad sound, bad filming and I could go on and on. The short of it is the film is not worth the money."
1,Perfectly Silly,"A major problem with this film (and there are many) is that, in an inexcusable act of vanity, the writer/director cast himself as the lead in the film. This was a horrendous mistake because not only is he a terrible actor, but he is unattractive and makes it difficult to believe that the attractive Ben would wish to marry him. As for the plot, it starts out OK, but then gets sillier and sillier until the perfectly ridiculous end. Life is too short to waste time with this one."
1,bend over arthur,"This movie is a one star movie, nothing more. And I don't think it pretends to be anything else. It's just a totally amateurish attempt at a gay themed movie. There are so many lapses of logic, so many stupid, unreal events, that it is quickly apparent this movie is made to laugh at. It would be incredulous to me to think the writer, director, producer, lead star (yes, all the same guy!) meant for this to be taken seriously. The distributors misled us, though, with the picture of the hot guy on the cover of the dvd, appealing to our prurient desires. The picture is the best thing about this product, and except for some unintended comedy, it's the only thing of value in this movie! It's all downhill after that.Kudos to all the other reviewers here on Amazon. I laughed my a** off at their many virulent comments, by far more entertaining than anything I saw in the film. It was worth watching the movie just to then read everyone's comments!"
1,Doesn't press all of the strings,What good is a capo that only presses down half of my strings? The 6 larger strings sound great and the other half just sound dead. The tension on this thing really needs to be adjustable or something. Really terrible capo and I'm definitely returning mine. Don't buy this thing.
4,good,"The capo works very well on frets 2-9 on my guitar. (12 string acoustic) It isn't tight enough to hold down the strings on the 1st fret, and it doesn't work on the 10th because the shape of my guitar neck changes there where it meets the body. Highs are wide width and ease of use. Low is that it doesn't cover the first fret. Overall, its good and you might be able to use it on 6 string guitars although it doesn't work on my electric because its too tight and the strings' pitch is distorted."
5,Happy-Happy-Happy,Item is exactly what I was looking for. Super fast shipping and well packaged. Highly recommend seller.
2,Waste of money,"I bought this capo for my 12 string Seagull and it is difficult at best to get this work. It doesn't have enough tension to hold down all the strings and often either pulls them out of tune or the strings don't play. The closer you get to the headstock the worse it is. Not once have I ever been able to get it to work on the first fret, second fret is maddening, 3rd fret is slightly less maddening, fourth fret, hit or miss, and so on, it only gets marginally better as you move up the neck but what's the point of a Capo if you can't use it anywhere on the neck that you need to.I have a Keyser capo for my 6 string Washburn and it works beautifully, I just think they don't put enough tension on their ""12 string"" capos to be be effective. So I'm off to find a new better capo for my 12 string. If you are Seagull 12 string owner don't waste your time, energy or money on this capo you will only end up poorer, and more frustrated."
5,It's a capo!,"Good price. Works great. Solid workmanship. Hugs the instrument firmly. Enough said! Apparently, eight more words are required for this."
5,Kyser makes great products!,"I tried playing my 12-string with a regular capo, but the spring wasn't stiff enough to hold the strings. This one has a stiffer spring. Works great!"
2,not as expected,"This is the fourth Peter Makena cd that I have ordered. The first three I love; they highlight his pure, radiant vocal renditions of spiritual songs. Truly trancendant. In Hallelujah, the experience is very different. I felt like I walked into a choir and had to weed through the voices to find his. It felt too busy to me and is disappointing on the whole."
1,hard-reading memoir,"edited by Robert E. Lee, one of Harry's sons, this is really hard to read due to the flowery language. I mean, you can read a whole page and then realize he didn't say anything of significance! But, it is insightful if you're interested in the Revolutionary War and its effect on the South. I was particularly interested in his handling of Tarleton...""the unrelenting conqueror shut his ears to the voice of supplication, as he had steeled his heart against the claims of mercy."" Like elsewhere in the book, you have to read all the lengthy footnotes for explanations of exactly what transpired. Lee wrote as though every thought was going to be quoted, like the famous quote about Washington. I admit though, that I've never read another Rev. War account that matches this! I just wouldn't recommend this to the casual reader."
3,Alaska cruise routes,"I took this chart and a handheld GPS on an Alaska cruise. A couple of times a day I would plot our position and speed. As a boater and recreational navigator it was fun and good practice. However, the cruise ship had a chart posted by the dining room with similar info...and the TV in the cabin had a ship's channel with constant Navigational info (lat/lon, speed, etc.) so my effort was duplicated. But still was fun and interesting."
5,I love my Taschen Calendar!,I am big fan of Taschen books and I love their calendars. I ordered this item expecting the same high quality photos I have grown to love. If you love modern design then this is the calendar for you. It has a plastic cover on the front and back pages and enough room in the date slots to write everything you need to do for that day. I highly recommend this item to anyone who loves design and wants something orginal to carry around their important dates.
2,Even on first sharpening 'Lead' breaks off,"These pencils lay down color very well and the color holds fast. The major flaw is that the 'lead' breaks off frequently.On the very first sharpening 1 of the pencil's, every time I got a good point, the 'lead' simply slid out and fell on the floor, until it was too short to sharpen any further.So, right off the bat I was down to 11 colors. Over the next couple of weeks as I used them portions of the 'lead' of 3 other pencils- after sharpening- fell out as well. In the end only 6 of the pencils last and worked as they should.At the same time I bought a set of their 'Prismacolor Thick Lead' pencils, and had an even worse time with these. Leaving me w/ only 5 pencils that held their lead.If you happen to get a set that doesn't fall apart they just might turn out be great pencils and a good value."
5,Amazing!,"I bought these in the summer, and all I have to say is that I love them! they are great for some of my projects. The shipping was super fast, and it was the cheaper one. I would recommend!"
4,Got A Love For You,"If you like old school house, then this is a solid album to add to your collection. The original and remix versions of ""Got A Love For You"" will make you want to get up and dance, or at least bring back some old clubbing remembrances."
1,awful,This sounds like a native tribe singing in the jungle. If Your into that kind of stuff this is the perfect cd for you. But I have no idea why i ordered it. it had something to do with the only review on it that said you can dance to it and so on. but you can dance to it if your in henna paint dancing naked around a fire performing some kind of ceimony.
2,Not a very useful size,"I purchased several of these to give as stocking stuffers. When they arrived, I was very disppointed. they are a lot smaller than expected. Still gave them as stocking stuffers, just everyone got two so they could put them side by side and actually use them. Also, they are not as sticky as others I have had...they keep peeling up from the dash. Will purchase different ones in the future."
3,Didn't fit my 1996 Fender Strat...,I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980's... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didn't fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didn't return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What I'm getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I haven't bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins.
2,waste of money,Its a good quality cable and all but this thing tangles up way to much. I thought at first mine might have been defective but I tried my friend who has the same 1 andit tangles up way too easily.....it might be alright for keyyboards but deffinately not guitar ...my much cheaper planet waves 1 is a lot better and cost a lot less.
5,another great CD,"This is the second CD from the Jazz for a ... series that I own. Once again I found a top notch album. The mixture of artists is excellent. Each brings a unique style to the the jazz genre. I would recommend this CD to anyone, jazz lover or not."
3,"Not the ""32 jazz"" series","I ordered this because I thought it was a part of the ""32 jazz"" series. I have many of these including ""Jazz for a Rainy Afternoon,"" ""Jazz for when you're alone"" etc.This CD imitates the series, with similar cover photography and even the exact typeface for the titles. It is manufactured ""..under license from 32 Jazz.""The music is just fine though. I'm glad I have the CD."
2,Headphone Jack Hisses,The speakers sound great but the headphone jack (my primary reason for purchasing the system) hisses loudly at all volume levels. I'm returning them.
2,Classics in Translation,"Pere Goriot is a great novel, though what I loved as a college student is not what I loved upon re-reading. As a younger reader I loved the sacrificial devotion of the father for his daughters. As a mature adult, I was disturbed, finding it what we now would call enabling and infantilizing.The characters are so well drawn, as are the times, the era, the city of Paris in all it's glory and misery. These are what make the book greatThe problem is the translations of many of these free books. They are translated by more than one person, and it's very obvious. Some sections are fine, others very poor and hard to follow. So we aren't getting a fair shot at reading the novel as it was written. It's too bad, because these erratic translations may turn some readers away from the classic,novels of the 18th and 19th centuries."
5,Excellent!,"A ""down-to-earth"" approach to understanding the differences between men and women; differences that keep us from the intimacy we need and deserve. The magic of this book will bring out the magic in your relationship."
5,Challenging Indeed!,"This book was a great mental workout. I've done a lot of work with probability and statistics over the years but some of the problems in this little book made me see things in new ways. I passed it around to several of the math geeks at work and they were very impressed and, like me, a bit humbled."
3,challenging?,The majority of the problems (> 50%) are simple and would probably seem even trivial to some one who has taken a couple of college courses in probability and statistics (and still remembers them). There are a few interesting problems but the solutions are needlessly long winded with heavy reliance on algebra -- often there were simpler and more intuitive ways of solving the same problem. The intended audience seems to be a high school senior or a beginning undergraduate with an interest in math.
3,Interesting problems,"This is a collation of various interesting probability problems - like the lying and truth-saying tribes.Good for someone to get interested in how probability works in our day-to-day life and mathematical puzzles.For serious statistical readers, these must have already been read/solved.Suhas"
3,"Challenging, sometimes lacking explanation","I got this book because I enjoy programming challenges, probability and logical reasoning and wanted to strengthen my math skills. With that said, I struggled right out of the gate with the problems. I understood the problems and was able to solve them on my own but when reading the solution and trying to follow through with the mathematical approach I found myself completely confused. The math isn't always intuitive and the author makes a few leaps during his explanations that not only could I not follow, but I couldn't recreate in my own math. This was frustrating to no end and I still don't understand a lot of the math he used to get to his solutions. It's a great book if you like challenges and probability and those who have a stronger math background than myself might enjoy this book a lot. However, for me this book just didn't quite make the cut and I'd really enjoy one with a better set of answers and explanations to go with."
5,Probability taken to the next level,"I enjoy solving probability puzzles. I considered myself to be pretty good- I could solve any problem that the GRE practice exams could throw my way. Until I opened this book.This book takes off where I ended up. The first problem is a variation on the ""reach into a bag"" probability problem. (Q: You reach into a drawer with red socks and black socks, and the probability of drawing 2 red socks is P=0.5. What is the minimum number of both colored socks?)You won't find the typical probability problems that can be quickly solved with basic combinatorial analysis or the Bernoulli Coefficient. You'll find variations and completely new worlds of probability. The explanations are thorough but succinct, and will arm you with a new skill set for solving such problems.There's no other book like it on Amazon, and for $7...Comparable to Huff's ""How to Lie with Statistics"" in its originality and straight-forwardness."
4,Well worth owning--a good piece of earwax for you,"This band has been overlooked. Now that they're cheap, you owe it to yourself to take a ride with these aliens. Eugenius developed a melodious-rock presence, without saturating themselves in shmaltz. Savor these delectable tunes, yet savor them without prejudice or salsa. Just let them cruise through your ears and into your brain. In the process, you will, like me, become ""happy again."""
5,Close to a perfect album,"Any fan of pop in the vein of Teenage Fanclub or the like will NOT be disappointed by this. I was not very familiar with the Vaselines and will definetly check them out but one thing that strikes me the most about this CD, besides the catchy hooks, is the sincerity of the lyrics. It's like I can feel the emotion coming through, something not common. To me, I can listen to either the Flaming Lips or Eugenius when I am sad, and it is impossible not to be in a good mood afterwards. The only bad part is they only have two albums! What happened? I like Mary Queen of Scots too, but to me it is more down tempo than Oomalama"
2,Ho hum,"I enjoy indie pop and heard a song or two from this CD elsewhere and thought they weren't bad. However, these songs have been making their way off my iPod pretty quickly. They're pretty average songs and the singer is just not that good. He seems like he's forcing it. It sounds more like your neighbor's mediocre garage band."
5,Buy By The Case,"Zatarain's New Orleans Style Red Bean Seasoning Mix, 2.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)This stuff is so good I buy it by the 12 box pack!It makes cooking red beans a snap. Just add water and seasoning mix to beans. How much easier can it get?The flavor is awesome! It takes the spice cabinet and puts it in the pot with one mix.Saves money not having to buy all the different spices - they are all in the packet!It has made red beans and rice a hit in my home!"
3,Test it somewhere else before buying,"The fragrance is OK, not exactly my cup of tea. I had mistaken it with another Taz cologne by Damascar which I bought at the Warner Bros. shop a long time ago."
5,One of the best rleases of the 1980's,"THIS IS NOT HAIR METAL. This is a band from Detroit, who later reformed, without singer Kenny Mugwump, as Sponge. LOUDHOUSE WAS A MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN SPONGE!IMO, For Crying Out Loud is one of the best and most underrated rock releases of all time. By today's standards, it is still ahead of it's time. It shows an originality, in arrangements and in the structuring of the lead vocals, that is rarely seen. This CD is diverse, heavy, tastefully done, and very addicting.For Crying Out Loud is one of my all time favorite rock releases. From the hard driving opener ""Faith Farm,"" the techno flavored ""Loudhouse,"" the excellent groove of ""Super Soul Killer,"" to one of the best acoustic songs of all time ""King Among The Ruins,"" this CD is 100% Grade A rock. Every track is amazing.I was lucky to see the band in Cleveland, supporting this CD. Kenny Mugwump was a one of a kind frontman and Loudhouse was a one of a kind band. Superb. 5+ stars all the way."
4,good for price,Still can not get to fit perfectly snug but it still stays on & protects my ears. the forehead straps shift when I grapple but the ear protectors stay over my ears .... that is what is important
3,Decent aside from chinstrap,"It seems pretty sturdy and comfortable to wear, but the chin strap's velcro comes undone once in a while.I used to have the Cliff Keen signature 4-strap headgear which didn't have this problem."
4,Godd Product,"Great product, not Bulky like Klief Keen, one thing is you need to adjust top strap really snug, otherwise it moves too much.Been using it for few weeks it's comfortable till now"
2,You get what you pay for,"With the thin straps I should have realized that this thing would slide all over my head. The gear protected my ears, but keeping it in place was distracting."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"During My 1st match, The headgear kept on moving around and eventually fell down to my neck. It is comfortable around the ears but NO STABILITY ON THE HEAD what so ever... DO NOT BUY IT! No matter how tight it will be on you it will slide off... that's the only guarantee about this purchase."
4,Hmmm...,great deal for these semi-cheesy yet semi-classic films...only thing i wish they would've done different was include the original released dvd's that were in widescreen format as all 3 are full framed.
1,NOT WIDESCREEN!,"I'm very disappointed in Sony for releasing a box set these days in full screen only, what's worst is that it's not indicated anywhere on the box. You have to unwrap it to find out and therefore cannot return it to amazon, their policy states: We cannot accept the return of books, CDs, videos, and DVDs unless they are unopened and still in their plastic wrap or in original condition. I guess I'm stuck with it now."
1,"""Look Who's Talking"" DVD Box Set",I have not even received this yet. I am not happy at all and I may not order from Amazon again because of it. I don't even have any information to follow up this purchase.Sincerely....Kathy Bigby
2,Too many sex-negative stories,"Most of the stories in this volume are clever, well-written, and fashionably postmodern. But that doesn't make them sexy! Story after story, I kept feeling that many of these authors just plain don't like sex. A few stories are fun and sexy, but these are very rare. The book has sex galore, but very little of it is what I'd call erotic."
4,"Wry, Light-Hearted Tennis Buddy Comedy","Hey, what can I say -- I wish they would make more movies about tennis.I completely agree with the deftly played and very relaxed, stoner ex-pro in this shaggy dog tennis buddy film: ""Tennis is the joyous expression of life.""He's right. This is an affable, not-trying-too-hard look at struggling actors and industry types in Hollywoood that is centered around the celebrity-tennis circuit. It's funny, cute, wry, and light -- if you are looking for Citizen Kane, look elsewhere.But there are several very funny scenes, and the stars/writers are delightful and very enjoyable in a low-key, sad-sack manner.Particularly recommended for tennis fans."
4,Super cute,This is the cutest toy. Flash even works!! Has fake LCD on the back. When the button is pushed the picture changes. This is fun for 10 months-3 years :)
2,Disappointed,"I received this camera today and am very disappointed. It is cheaply made and has very little for the child to actually do. The ""flash"" is simply a red light that come on when a button is pushed. This is not the quality I was expecting."
3,NOT Digitally Remastered!!!!!!,This DVD has not been digitally remastered. The sound and picture quality are from the original cartoon. So you will think the picture is not bright.My wife and daughter still enjoy this dvd. Just know that when you buy this dvd it is not remasterd!!
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I was hoping to have some step by step instructions, starting out slowly and then gradually moving up to speed. Instead, these instructions moved along rather quickly from one position to the next, and the instructions were given in somewhat of a rapid monotone. It was like they already expected you to know what the positions were called and didn't need time to figure them out. I suppose if I had kept stopping and rewinding every few seconds I would have eventually gotten it, but it was a lot of bother. I eventually got a balance ball with instructions, and am much happier working out with that."
3,Not for Me,I guess the video is fine. I should have brought the beginners level. With the multilevel they start with the beginning pose and proceed to the advanced pose. This was confusing me because I thought I was supposed to keep moving with them. But I was actually supposed to stay with the beginning pose and ignore the advanced poses. It was confusing and not for me. I like Yoga but I'm not into that spiritual stuff associated with it. That is why I brought this. Maybe I'll try the beginners DVD. But right now I'm just not interested.
2,Okay but poor setting and audio,"I bought his dvd because it was christian based and had a devotional However,the bible readings are done at the same time the instuctor is giving the video and it distracting. The setting is also yucky. Other exercise videos try to pic a refreshing setting but this one is done in a room. I don't think it is worth it."
4,Lush instrumental music with a modern interpretation.,"In this album, arranger and conductor Michel Legrand presents a modern interpretation of 18 musical standards that were popular in radio broadcasts in the wake of the World War 2. If you like lush instrumental music with muted brass and the ear-kissing sounds of magical violins, all with a modern bass beat, you will enjoy this album. The tempo varies from ""drifting and dreaming"" to the infectuous sounds of ""toe tapping"" Latin rythms. This is easy listening music that sounds great in the background or in the foreground."
3,Handy-dandy,"This is a good book to have on hand, although you won't want it to be your ONLY theological dictionary/handbook. It's VERY portable, and the definitions are concise and readable. I used it a lot my first year of seminary, keeping it in my bag so that I could look things up on the sly in classes when I didn't know what the professor was talking about. It also helped immensely when I was studying for my systematics final exam."
5,Great Book For Current & Future Pastors,"This book was a lifesaver as I began my early college courses in Theology. It is a quick and easy resource that you can use to look up hard to understand theological terminology. It is laid out in a similar format to that of a dictionary. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is seriously pursuing a call into pastoral ministry, or to someone who is merely interested in expanding their understanding and breadth of vocabulary when it comes to Christian Theology."
3,Lacks Energy,"I am a great fan and saw this tour along with many others. The energy just isn't present in this DVD performance. ELP ceased to grow musically and the music became rote. It shows! After seeing it...and I did enjoy parts...I forgave Greg for leaving the band. The Royal Albert Hall performance is far superior, although Black Moon was cut from the footage,(Who decides these things?) ELP's energy in that performance and the audience's responce make it the next best thing to actually being there. Still, if you're a die hard, it's worth owning."
5,Great live Disc,This is an amazing live show. You won't be disappointed if you're an ELP fan. The sound and video are well performed and edited well.
2,"Makes ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" look like Spielberg","I am shocked no one has mentioned in the reviews the most glaring flaw of this video- the camera angles are insanely bad and ill timed! The group is Emerson, Lake and Palmer but you would think it is Lake, Palmer and the off camera keyboard guy! It takes two minutes and sixteen seconds into Karn Evil 9 before Emerson gets onscreen- unbelievable. Throughout the show, Keith Emerson is performing a blazing solo, but you're seeing the back of Carl Palmer's head, or Greg Lake standing with his hands at his sides.. All I can figure is the producer was completely unfamiliar with the band and material. Buy if you enjoy yelling at your television."
4,GOOD VALUE BUT WITH DIFFERENT HEADPHONES,"This is a great bargain, excellent sound and it looks good too. Only one fault, the headphones are not very robust - mine broke quite easily."
1,Didn't last long - and where is GPX?,"Bought this for a gift for Christmas 2000, it stopped playing in April. Of course we can't find anything but the manual and receipt - all with no trace of who GPX is or where, except ""High Hill, MO"" (no listing for GPX there on switchboard.com). I may be wrong, but I suspect this is a classic case of getting what you pay for. Buyer beware!"
4,GOOD PLAYER CHEAP HEADPHONES,"I reallt like the player itself. It looks nice and the quality is excellent. The headphones that come with the unit are rediculous, terrible, and uncomfortable. If you are willing to spend twenty bucks on good headphones additional to the diskamn this is a good system. Another downside is that it does not read all CDR disks."
1,Watch out for the 3 Month Warranty,"When I first purchased this last November, I thought it to be a super purchase (that is for except for the cheesy looking headphones, which I tossed in the trash on day one). It was great for my daily train ride into Manhattan. I could walk with it to the office with minimal skips. However, 2 months ago, it just stopped working. After reviewing the warranty information, I saw a 3 month warranty. Most reviewers indicated they loved the features and the price. You get what you pay for folks. Hello Sony...I've learned my lesson.."
3,Pretty Good for the money,it works well but it does not sound good with the bass on and also when you turn it up and head phones are trash so go out and buy some nice ones but most head phones are trash it looks really cool but if a lot of dumb losers on your bus hit it a lot it will not work well but shocks are good enough for the bus and jogging and fits well in your pocket but with shocks on u go through a lot of battteries is spenend like $20 on batteries a month but for the money it is pretty good but i wanna give it 3 and 1/2 starss
1,Don't Buy This!,"First of all, when I first got this, the headphones broke immediately. Then it wouldn't read some of my cds. I thought there might be a problem with my individual player, but when I got it exchanged, the one they gave me wouldn't play either. Don't buy this. There are many better brands out there."
2,Huh......,"Many people who enjoy this player seemed like they had never operated one before. Of course the ESP would work if you ""smack it or even drop it"". Do you have any idea how ESP works, obviously not. It is stored in an electronic memory for 40 seconds (or whatever) until the song gets to that part. By dropping a player, you physically can't delete this information. ESP - >>Electronic Skip Protection. I say get the $70 ones."
1,this cd player blows,"this is the worst cd player ever. PLease don't buy it, it broke a few weeks after i bought it. The esp doesn't even keep it from skipping."
2,"Broke once, shame on them. Broke twice, shame on me","This seems like a great little player. Until it stopped reading CDs. I returned it, and instead of asking for a refund, asked for a replacement. This one failed also. I'm very gentle with electronics. This was not abused. I, however, was, in trying to get a refund after the second one died. Anyone want a CD player that doesn't play CDs?"
1,GPX'S PHONE NUMBER,"I LOCATED GPX BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER YOU GIVE IT A TRY314-588-1202. THEY ARE OUT OF HIGH HILL, MO"
2,"It's all right, but.. I don't recommend it","This cd player is very decent for it's price and it works alright so far. I happened to be disappointed in it when I received it in the mail. There was so many features that bring down the quality of the cd playeritself. It doesn't make a good car cd player unless you go on very long trips. Everytime you turn off the car, the cd player turns of it's Electronic Shock Protection and you have to turn it on each time. Second it doesn't have a resume button, so you have to start your cd all over again. It lacks a place for a remote. It's just too much of a hassle. The only real good thing about it is maybe it has 40 sec esp. I wouldn't recommend that this a cd player as a thing to make a big deal about."
5,Who knew something so inexpensive could be THE BEST??,This is the first portable CD player that i've ever bought and the best price and sound quality that i've ever heard of. It's cool looking and comes with all sorts of accesories. the sound is great!!! BUY IT!!
4,A pretty good CD player,"I needed a CD player for my office and for car trips. This one fit the bill perfectly and it's *cheap*. Six months down the road, I'm still happy with it.As other reviewers have pointed out, the headphones are not too sturdy, but they're fine for ""normal"" use. Maybe not if you're going to throw them in your backpack everyday though.The anti-shock works well. I drive a Jeep that's always bounces around, and the CDs keep on going (but not when I get offroad)."
4,"Good Player, Sub-Par Headphones","This cd player is excellent, although it isn't perfect. It's to your benefit to use the skip protection unless you're not moving. The headphones have less than average sound quality. Other than that, the cd player is great. The boost bass works very well. The player itself is surprisingly slim. It looks great, plays great, and, with a new pair of headphones (Sony - trust me on that) sounds great. It's priced quite nicely considering it comes with a car kit and AC adapter. If you're looking for a new cd player and don't want to spend too much, this is a great buy."
2,A Portable Electronics fan from PA,"In viewing this product and reading it's description, features and extras along with the low price; it appears to be a really good buy. If you value price over quality, sound and durability,then this is the player to buy.Despite it's great looks and numerous extras; I honestly cannot recommend this product.The components are very cheaply constructed, the headphones break quite easily and the player itself is very poorly constructed. The player also lacks good sound quality; often times the sound is distorted.You can purchase better quality portable players for a fraction more and get a lot more life and playing time out of it."
1,GPX...BEWARE OF RETAIL LAUGHTER,"I worked at a rather well-known books-movies-music-games store a year back, and upon a customer purchasing anything GPX, we either chuckled or groaned. Chuckled because we knew that the GPX line of technology is made for the customer that values price over usability and quality (laymen's terms...GPX is ....), and groaned, because we knew we'd see the unit back in the store for a full refund a day or so later. If you're heart's set, by all means get this player..but if you see yourself playing with it a year or so down the line, forget it. Try Panasonic (the Shockwave line is great(!), but one of the most expensive) or Sony, who is good, too."
3,Pretty Good,"Well, it doesn't have the resume thing, and I like that in a CD Player, and it doesn't have the repeat 1/repeat all thingie, which I REALLY like in a CD Player, but it does have Intro, which is pretty cool. It looks TOTALLY cute, the see-through blue cover really caught my fancy, and what totally rocks is that the headphones actually match, and have the see through stuff on them too! although...the headphones are kinda fruity also, (sorry, i talk weird)aka: they break easily. The thing that really ticks me off is that that company only made what they had to and no more, that really peeves me, they should of and could of put a lot more effort into this, but they only gave what they had to, it's a really awesome design, but there should be more behind it. If ya wanna show it off to your friends, it's the perfect thing, but I'd suggest getting another one too, to actually LISTEN to the music with, lol."
3,EXCELLENT RECORDING FROM THIS GERMAN TRIO.,"With out a doubt, one of the best recordings from a german ""synth."" band. ""That Smiling Face"" has great lyrics. while ""The Great Commandments"" has that great synth. music of the late 80's. which at the time was being compared to that of ""Depeche Mode"". If you like this type of music, Then this is one you will like."
3,Excellent techno-rock.,"This CD is a good compilation of German techno-rock. If you like this type of music, this CD may be for you."
3,"Quite nice, but...","A nice album to listen to but had Depeche Mode never existed, I have a doubt Camouflage wouldn't have either. ""The Great Commandment"" is the obvious hit here, one of the few songs from my childhood I remember hearing everywhere. If they had cut this album down to about 5 or 6 songs it would have worked better because the Depeche Mode imitating gets a bit tiresome after a bit. In fact ""The Great Commandment"" is really the only song that stands out above the rest, that doesn't the rest is bad but the best albums are the ones where you buy them for the big hit single and it ends up that there's several better tracks on there. This album you're probably buying for TGC, and that's the best you'll be be getting."
3,Pop a la (Depeche) Mode.,"1980s nostalgia aside, this is an okay release. While the music is as catchy and lively as synth pop records go, Germany's Camoflauge have released a debut that more than resembles a Depeche Mode record. ""The Great Commandment"" is the big single here, with synth touches and a semi-goth feel that sounds like an outtake from the recording sessions of DM's ""Construction Time Again."" The rest of the album is similar in vein, with dark touches that come up throughout the album. The lyrics are clumsy at best, showing that English is clearly not Camoflauge's first language. But no matter. For 1980s synth pop, you can do much worse than ""Voices and Images."""
5,For The Person Who Wants to Cook with Herbs,"There are many books available to spend time on all the varying uses for herbs (gardens, medicine, etc.) and nothing wrong with that. But for those of us who are into herbs for the sole purpose of the culinary zest they so wonderfully provide, this is significant resource in a small, well done fashion.Color photos, herb by herb info, as well as recipes and aids with sources, insect and disease problems, this is valuable aid to us herb growers for the table.From planning to preparing to planting to cultivating to problem cures to harvesting to recipe utilization, this is solid 105 pages of herb wisdom."
4,Everything is great except the delete/home keys.,"The trouble is that when you buy a ""compact"" keyboard, and so many new keyboards are using a compact style, the delete/home keys end up being non-standard position. Reaching for these keys drives me crazy. Other than that, I am very happy with the keyboard, including the multimedia features. I like it better than cheap logitech 200 keyboard that I got at Wal-Mart."
1,haven't recieved this!!,"I would like to know where this product is???? Ive never not recieved a product from Amazon, so please contact me with the reson it has not arrived.Nancy Tripp 918-734-4099"
5,Excellent singer excellent music and excellent lyrics!!,I found this cd browsing in a store and when I saw it was a Cuban artist got interested in finding out what was new!!!And THERE IS!!!Love the combination of salsa merengue and other rythms I kept finding!!!!Waiting eagerly for his next cd!!!
5,listened and loved,one of the most interesting combination of salsa pop.Very good quality.If you speak spanish you should listen carefully at each one of the songs.They're fun
3,not his best,Bought this CD based upon some other reviews but was a little disappointed as it did not live up to some of his past CD's which are GREAT!!! This one is only so-so
5,Very pleasantly surprised,"I had never heard of Tab Benoit until I heard him on Sirius Channel 74. I decided to explore and settled on this CD. Let's just say I wasn't disappointed, this is a great disc."
2,disco,"It is dance music. I heard a singer on WBGO and really liked her. When the set was over I waited to hear who it was. Having never heard of Deborrah Cox before I thought that I had discoverd a great Jazz singer. So I bought two of her CD,s. The other one was good."
2,Just correcting previous reviewers,"First and foremost im an enormous Deborah Cox fan. Their are few voices with her crystalline and powerful vocals. However I had to intervene when I read back to back reviews that stated Deborah cox's voice is superior to that of Mrs. Whitney Houston, or as I like to call her...the greatest singer of all time. I think people are making the mistake of comparing the 2 currently. In her day Whitney was incomparable, and still even now with a diminishing voice she still surpasses most singers out there....including Deborah Cox. There is however no doubt that Mrs. Cox is a stellar singer in the category of greats such as Whitney, Mariah, Yolanda Adams, Celine, Patti, etc. But make no mistake noone is superior vocally to the ridiculously talented Whitney Houston."
5,The Editorial Review is incorrect above,"There's no female in this band. I have no idea what the editorial review is talking about. It's 3 members of the band Journey including Gregg Rolie, Ross Valory, Steve Smith. The other 2 guys are Kevin Chalfant, and Josh Ramos. If you like Journey, you'll really like this disc. It's actually 12 tracks."
3,"Ok, but left me wanting the old Journey to reunite",Good album overall. Nice to hear Greg Rolie again. Track #2 and #12 are my choices.
4,Good,Good cd from storm a lot of songs for the people who likes this kind music.Listen in my opinion.
1,Awful product!,The wood on it is very heavy and makes it almost impossible for a young toddler to rock it. The music thing on the ear is pathetic and last for like 3 seconds and then shuts off. It died the first week we had it. Less than a month of owning it the neck of the thing broke while my daughter was trying to rock it and she toppled over the top. She was not being rough with it or using it in anyway inappropriately. Would not recommend this product to anyone!
3,Serious Sound,Whether you're looking for killer sound for video games or for music this system provides both. It puts out ear bursting power. I never realised just how bad my other speakers were til I used these bad boys. Worth the price.
3,Good for a year,"For the first year I had these, they were amazing. But then the left speaker siding started vibrating whenever a specific frequency was emitted. For example, when watching Pulp Fiction, John Travolta's voice causes the siding to make a high pitched sound. I ignored it for a few months, but it's more noticable now and I can't take it anymore. Also, the virtual surround thing doesn't really happen. It is kind of cool though."
3,Fast and fun frolick,"This was a fun and fast read. I laughed out loud a few times and enjoyed the fun and lively character of Seonaid. Despite some cute love scenes there really wasn't a connection between Seonaid and her intended (Blake); he was mainly a foil for her jokes and wanderings. Basically, Seonaid and Blake have been engaged in an arranged way for years and he has finally decided to come claim his bride. Seonaid tries desperately to escape Blake, and a lot of chasing and adventures happen along the way to marital bliss. The book was written in Scottish dialogue and was a bit hard to understand at first, but once you adjust to the writer it's all good. I would recommended the book for light reading and entertainment."
3,Not What I've Come to Expect,"I am a new fame of Lynsay Sands. So far I've read four of her stories. I loved the first three and rated them all 4 stars. The Chase will be the first book that I've rated three stars.The story of Seonaid and Blake lacked the humor and passion that I've come to expect from one of her novels. The Chase basically lived up to its title. Blake spent most of the novel chasing Seonaid over Scotland. Blake didn't want to marry her and it took him 8 long years and an order from the king of England to finally make him collect his bride. She was 24 and he could have married when she was 16. Only when he got around to it she was gone and that's when The Chase began. I did like Seonaids unconvential upbringing. She was raised like a son. She could handle a sword and take care of herself.Overall, the book was just okay. I just think the story wasn't very interesting and I kept expecting more chemistry and get to know you moments between Blake and Seonaid.Sensaulity rating 3 out of 5."
3,a little chalky,"this has a chalky flavor compared to the sugar-added counterparts. Otherwise, the chocolate flavor is acceptable."
4,Good Mix,"I have never heard of Frisell before I read this CD's Stereophile Magazine review, where it got the prestigious ""Record of the Month"" award. As my past experience shows, the guys at Stereophile know a thing or two about music, and so I bought this CD. And you know what? they were right.Offereing a good mix of jazz and blues, much musical variety, and some excellent bass performance, this CD will never let you down. It's also very well recorded, and worth listening to in a good hi fi system."
5,The Best Book In the World!,"I will recommend this book Warriors! by Jim Eldridge, to someone who likes action, wepons,and physical conflict. This book talks about warriors combat skills and couage. These warriors are from the past, present, and future. Inrome, a gladiator, does not want to go to war because his daughter, Cat, is sick. The war master kills Cat in front of him so he will go to war. Will this bave gladiator retaliate, or go to war?By Kelvin"
5,i love it,i love this movie because it based on a true movie and i just love them movie and i always want this movie
2,Predictable,"I was interested in seeing this movie and how this subject was treated. While this film and I may agree philosophically, I have to say it's one of the most poorly written and acted film I've seen in a long time. It lives up to every negative stereotype of Christian movies. Rebecca St James is a far better singer than actor."
5,Sarah makes the right choice,"In a world where many of our choices are made, and later regretted, Sarah makes the right choice. It would be easy for an unwed young woman, with her whole life in front of her, to take the easy way out. Sarah gets it right. Way to go Sarah."
3,Better Than I Expected...,"This film is better than I thought it would be. Sometimes, when I view a Christian film I brace myself for excessive cheesiness, emotion or poor quality. Sarah's Choice is mostly well written and decently acted. There are moments of ""really?"" and, of course, since a singer is playing a main part there's plenty of song showcasing during moments of introspective thought and relational interaction. Overall it's watchable and touching and it might even be healing for someone who has suffered the emotional decisions surrounding abortion."
3,"Good story, bad acting","I bought this for our church library, and I wasn't expecting much since it looks like a low budget film. I think it was well written, but the acting is terrible, even Rebecca St. James, and especially her boyfriend. At least they're trying to make more Christian movies now though."
4,A nice movie,"I bought this for my Mom for Christmas. I watched it and thought it was well done. The acting is just okay. The storyline is a pregnant young woman unsure of what to do. The movie was filmed from a christian perspective, and can be viewed by the whole family."
4,"A ""Choice"" That May Surprise You","This is a wonderful film, and a wonderful, often powerful, story. What may seem like a cheeky plot (and there are very brief moments, at times) is surprisingly executed with honesty, understanding, uncertainty, and (as it's title notes) choices. Rebecca St. James makes the amazing leap from singer to actress very subtly, yet carries the same amount of honesty, love and understanding as she does to her music. (You may be surprised by her performance at times, as well.) Overall, this is a well-made film with mostly solid performances, a fine-tuned script, and universal emotion to spare. A solid family pick.(For the record, the DVD came through the mail alright! Thank you.)"
4,worth watching,"This movie was better than many of these kinds of films are, if not up to the usual ""Hollywood"" standard. It didn't always make sense (Sarah had a good job but apparently couldn't pay her rent?) and it was pretty heavy-handed at times (the abortion doctor and Sarah's friend). Also, Sarah was rather unbelievably dense. Really? She needed all three visions to make her choice? And the Magical Christmas card didn't clue her in?That said though, I did enjoy the film, partly because self-involved characters redeemed themselves -- Sarah, her boyfriend, and her best friend. There were no saints in this film. No perfect characters. But in the end, they all grew up and figured out what was most important in life. I also enjoyed the secondary characters, especially Uncle Clay.I disagree with those who said the acting was bad. None of it was stellar, but I didn't find any of it particularly bad. In fact, the acting was better, I thought, than we usually get in these kind of films."
1,Seriously? Four stars?!!,"This movie is AWFUL! It's full of bad acting and awkward timing. The sound track is terrible, the characters aren't developed well, and the plot is unrealistic. I guess it's a must-see for the protesters outside of your city's abortion clinic. If you are one of those people, you will love it. Otherwise, you probably should not waste your time!"
4,A good introduction to new logistics concepts,"Is a nice book, the concepts are very clear and easy to understand even if you are not and english speaking person. Is a good presentation of a sourcing model."
5,Awesome morning,One of the best mornings I can remember was waking up in a sleeping bag on a seat in an old schoolbus in the middle of the Oregon high desert with the sun shining in through the windows and this album still playing in my headphones from the night before.
5,Acetone self titled,wonderful sounds. i play it every day. people hear it playing and want to know who it is and where can i get it. buy it and pass it around. share the aloha in this music.
5,A great resource on the rosary,"This book is an excellent resource on the rosary. It has an apologetic section which answers basic questions on devotion to Mary and the importance of praying the rosary. It also has a meditation on each of the twenty mysteries of the rosary, a scriptural rosary for each set of mysteries and John Paul II's Rosarium Virginis Mariae, in it's entirety. It is an invaluable resource as a source of reflection, and as a jumping off point for the really important part, praying the rosary on your own and coming to your own reflections on each mystery."
4,Not too much into details ...,"Molecular modeling is a topic every scientist is talking about. At least every physicist and chemist. When I started my diploma work doing molecular simulations of polymers, Gelins book was the first i had to read. and indeed it gives a good overview with very many references to standard literature. The book is diveded into twelve chapters starting with how polymer chains are built, how to consider the detailed interaction mechanisms and then going on to how specific polymeric properties, e.g. mechanical behaviour, scattering, conductivity ... can be and are simulated. The book suits best for people who want to get an introduction to the subject. For those already familiar with the principles of molecular modeling i'd suggest the book of Allen and Tildesley on ""Computer Simulation of Liquids""."
5,Uprockin' Bomfunk Beats!,"This track is blowin' up! It has awesome rap-style/old-school vocals that refer to break-dancin' moves and a bangin' beat. This is the first track that I have ever heard by these guys, and it is definitely a winner. I can't wait to hear some more! It has a ""U Asked for the Moon"", by Afrika Bombaata, sound to it. All of the remixes are tight. Very coooool! Check it out. If you are from my area, checkout the CD ""Got Breakz?"" which includes this awesome track. If my review was helpful to you, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
2,"Maybe the band name should just be, Man 5000","Ok, so, I accepted the fact that transform was a bit different than their past albums. I like it but not nearly as much as past albums such as tonight the stars revolt. This cd is just another transform except for one difference, worse songs, and worse music. Theyve turned into some type of petty punk band. What happened to the hardcore rocking that used to go on on their albums? Yes the cd is pretty good, but its not worth buying, and its definitely their worst. It makes me not want to go to their concert in detroit in sept. because im in fear that all they will play are these new songs. So, a word of advice, just download the album, I'm glad I did. If you want a real good new album that just came out, try Stone Sour: Come What(ever) May. They are still as good as ever if not 10x better."
4,Good change of pace for PM5K,"A tremendous follow up to 2003's somewhat bland Transform, PM5K really lets `er rip on Destroy. Featuring many fast-paced, hard-edged songs full of intense guitars and savvy lyrics while steering clear of their funk-rap-rock roots, Destroy is PM5K's best album yet.What makes this album unique from its predecessors are not only the sound, which is more mature and energetic than before, but also the lyrical quality. No longer does Spider (Powerman 5000's lead singer ([and only original member]) sing about the woes of space travel; instead, he draws inspiration from politics, friendship, and even music itself.If you never liked PM5K, give `em another try. This album is much different than you might expect. If you like Rancid, Velvet Revolver, The Misfits, Alice Cooper, The Clash, or other hard rock/punk bands, you're bound to like Destroy What You Enjoy.And the tambourine makes a few guest appearances - how can you say ""no"" to that?"
