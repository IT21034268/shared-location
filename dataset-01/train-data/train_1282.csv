5,Worth the $20-$30,"I've had these babies for a month or so now, so I can't vouch for the longevity of the Sennheiser HD 202 - but I can say the sound is great, especially at low volume. Nice lows, good highs; all natural sound that fills your ears and lets you hear the outside world as well. More than once I've had to take off the phones to see if the sound was coming from them or not. Beautiful.The pads are comfortable enough to wear for hours with no pinching or discomfort, and they come off for storage and potential replacement (increasing their life for years). It has a 3 meter cord which can wrap around this oval plastic thingie that they call a ""cable management clip"". I recommend wrapping it close to the end the plug that goes in to your computer so it doesn't drag down your head or fall off the table when you lean back to watch your favorite episode of Galactica. Maybe that's just me..."
5,Great Sound for the $,"I've been using the headphones for three weeks now and I am very pleased with the audio quality. They are also very comfortable on my fairly large head (7.5 hat size). The cord is very long, but with the cord caddy I find it very user friendly for any setup. I've used it for my iPod and my stereo receiver while in the room with others with no complaints."
5,Amazing,"I bought these headphones and I can't say enough how great they are. The Sennheiser HD 202 headphones have a great acoustic sound. It has an excellent bass to treble range, and the headphones are comfortable to wear.Cheap price, excellent quality. Great product."
2,Cups are too small,"I've had these for a few months now. Sound quality is decent enough, but the cans just don't fit my ears. I don't have Ross Perot size huge ears, but they aren't flat either. I'll be looking to buy another model. Might just keep these as a backup."
3,Long cord,The headset serves its purpose of providing good quality sound with bass boosting. But the problem is with the cord which is too long and the winding hinders comfort.
3,Uncomfortable if you wear glasses,"These headphones sound very nice, but they squeeze my head so tight they are almost immediately uncomfortable when I am wearing my glasses. They squeeze the arms of my glasses between my ears and my head and are very uncomfortable within minutes. I have to wear them only partially over my ears to avoid that problem, and then the noise isolation is poor. They are reasonably comfortable when I'm wearing my contacts.Also, based on the thickness of the padding, it looks as though they would have great sound isolation. However, I was surprised at how much of the audio from the headphones is audible to others around me. I, on the other hand, don't have much trouble drowning out outside noise when wearing the headphones."
5,Excellent Headphones for the Price,"I love these headphones. I was a little nervous about purchasing them for so cheap but they are excellent for the price. They are very comfortable, the earpieces are made of a soft material so they do not make me feel sweaty or uncomfortable while wearing them. The sound also is incredible. They are not noise canceling, but they do block out a substantial amount of background noise. I am very pleased with these headphones."
4,love/hate thing,"I am about to buy my third pair of HD202's. Love - the music reproduction, comfort. Hate - Why oh why is the cord so long, and so fragile? The reason my previous two pairs broke is the cord got caught on or in something and refused to work after that. It does come with a piece of plastic to wind the cord around but that just doesn't work."
4,Good Value for the Price,"I bought these for use at my desk at work. I don't like ear buds (at least not the ones I've tried) because I find them uncomfortable, so I tend to use over-the-ear headphones when I listen to something for an extended period of time, and these headphone are very comfortable in that regard. The sound quality is good too, especially for the price. However, if you want you want noise-cancellation without having to listen to music, these are not the headphones to buy. (Based on my experience with them, if you just put them on without playing anything they seem to actually increase the volume of background noise.)"
2,Sennheiser vs Sony,I bought these headphones 1) because they are so highly recommended on this site and are the bestsellers and 2) because my Sony headphones were built so poorly they literally fell apart.Unfortunately I could not find a pair of these for retail sale anywhere so I could try them out first. The sound is terrific. I have no complaints there. The cord is much longer than other brands which is a real plus. These headphones are astoundingly uncomfortable. They don't sit squarely and apply uneven and excessive pressure to my head. The Sony's were much more comfortable.
2,Sound starts to crackle way too easily,"I don't know, if I received a bad one or not. They were one of the worst value for money headphones. The HD 202 were not even close to the open-designed PMX 60 I owned earlier. Most of the headphones I've owned, my main grudge against them has been too much treble at default settings (except for the pmx60 and Philips HP 840). Same was the problem with Koss 'Plug' earphones and same with HD 202. I change the settings, but then every time I switch in my speakers or other headphones, I've to change again. Gonna spend a dollar or ten more and get better one's."
3,no good,"These are VERY uncomfortable! i wear glasses and it hurts everytime i put these headphones on because theyre SO tight. I tried stretching them out but that didnt work. Next i shortened the headband and that helped a bit. (my hat size is 7 1/4) Sound is ok (mine seems to be unequalized for some reason, as the right side is noticably louder than the left side) and noise cancellation is pretty good too. Because of the equalization problem and discomfort, i ended up buying the grado sr-60s a week later."
5,"good quality, great price","I love these headphones. They were cheap, and they make my ipod sound even better. The closed style makes it easy to listen to music without getting disturbed by others or disturbing them. You can get a pretty good volume out of this simple closed design before people other than you can start to hear the music.The sound reproduction is excellent, and they've been durable, too. They've been stepped on and squished quite a few times, in fact. Thumbs up."
3,Didn't last,"I got these for my friend last Christmas and they served him very well for a while. He found them comfortable and the sound quality to be very good. I tried them briefly and felt the same way. But less than a year later, they died on him. Can't easily recommend these unreliable headphones. If you want to take the gamble, they look and sound great for the price but they just might give out on you. This year, I got him a pair of Koss headphones to replace them because of their lifetime warranty. And, no, I have no idea if my friend called customer service."
4,Great headphones,"I've had this headphones for a little over 6 months now. They've been a pleasant surprise, given the price was under 25 dollars. It's been quite durable so far. I lug it around in my backpack, and it takes quite a beating. To simplify my review, I'll list my personal pros and cons in regards to the headphonesPros- Good sound quality- Quite durable ( so far )- Light and easy to travel with- Very comfortableCons- Long cord- Mid-levels can be improvedOverall, great value for money ! .. It's a little annoying with the long cord. The wrap around (clip, I guess) wasn't very useful. Finally, it's the most comfortable headphones I've had to date. I've continually been on it for 3 hours + without any trouble. I'm actually listening to some music on it right now, and I wouldn't think twice if I were to purchase another one of these. If you are on the verge of a purchasing decision.. I highly recommend it."
2,did not last long,"I have the same problem with both pairs of sennheiser headphones. They worked great for a few months, then one side starts going out. I suspect it is the cord. I guess I got my money worth, but would expect them to last longer since they are only used sitting at my desk and there has never been any damage, chewed cord, etc."
5,Best thing that happened to my ears in a closed setting,"These are really great, especially for the price. If you're looking for clean sound, great bass and to catch the smallest details in your songs you never get to hear, this is the way to go. It's not totally noise canceling but you don't miss a sound with these on. I'm excited to order the newer version and see how it's changed."
4,Excellent headphones!,"Needed comfort, and outside sound blocking(in our small house, we often have both TV and Stereo playing). These do the trick! I even fell asleep wearing them! Bonus: the cord is long enough to reach from TV to couch, and comes with a 'cord-wrap' for when less length is needed. Great sound, too. Had a brief scare when one side came off...but it snapped right back in! My old 'phones required duct tape!"
3,too low,"I bought those by mistake. I actually wanted HD-201 but somehow pressed button in the wrong window. Who wants a review from a stupid person, eh?The phones are kinda nice as to be expected from a Sennheiser. But they have exactly what I feared (and why I decided to not buy them) -- lots of bass and no highs. I am not a bass lover and I have no use for these headphones."
4,Great Sound. Not comfortable.,"I am a fan of Sennheiser products. Like all Sennheiser headphones this one's sound quality is great. Price is good, too.I also have a Senheiser HD497 and I prefer this one's sound quality over HD497. Deep bass, nice treble. The only thing I don't like about this headphone is the size. It is not flexible enough. So if you have a big head, it starts to hurt your ears after a while. If you have small or medium size head, this would be a perfect pair of headphone."
4,"Great item, but...","It's a great headphones with a good sound. The only cone is when I wear it for a long period of time it hurts my ears. If you scroll down and look some of the other reviews you will find that I am not alone in this. The thing is, I think, is that the foam around ear speaker (shaped like a doughnut) is too soft and after awhile plastic that's inside begin to push on my ear.In general it's a great deal for your money."
4,Almost Perfect!,"I bought the Sony Studiomonitor headphones and was troubled with the pain they inflicted on my poor ears. So returned those and bought these. HD202's got amazing sound quality, good sound isolation and most important they are much more comfortable than many other closed headphones. Although after about 2-3 hrs of continuous use, you begin to feel the pressure of the hard inside on your ears. Comfort from these headphones largely depends on the size of your ears and on how much they protrude on the outside to be pressed by the hard inside of the ear cups.I found them ok, but others may not feel so, so be sure to try them out before you buy, or atleast buy them from a place where you can return 'em. But definitely 10x better than the Sony Studiomonitor which press HARD all over your ear!"
4,Best Budget Cans for Desktop / Home Use,"I've had these for over a year now and they still rock! The wires on the speakers were severed due to use a few months ago but it was an easy fix... a couple of solders and they were good to go again. If you're looking for good cheap cans for desktop/home use this is it! I wouldn't recommend them for commute though, the wire is too long and this is just too big for that purpose."
4,Great Headphones for price,"As a college student I was looking to get great head phones for a cheap price that were extremely durable as I'm not the softest guy. These headphones are absolutely great! They're extremely comfortable, fit my head comfortably and I have a big head... along with the extremely long cord (~10 ft) I can leave my iPhone in my pocket and walk around without any limitations due to the long cord. The only one bad thing is that I love a lot of bass in my music, unfortunately these headphones do not produce the extreme low and loud bass, but for every other kind of music I suggest buying these headphones now! I listen to country to rap to classical and it is great in all genres, but as I said if you like a lot of bass - these may not be for you - but if you enjoy every other kind of music, these are the best headphones that you can get for $30! Love 'em!"
4,Just what I expected,Good quality and very good sound. Only downside is that because they cover your whole ear they do get warm in the summer.
2,Nine months and it's already falling apart,"I've only had it nine months and the cheap wire has frayed insulation, and the ear piece tends to fall off. Was expecting it to last longer and just ordered a different brand to replace it. Sound OK for a cheap set but I was expecting it to last longer. It is uncomfortable to wear and does press your ears until the cartilage hurts. You'll need to readjust every so often to press on a different part of your ear in order to be comfortable."
4,Good sound quality at an affordable price,"Have been using these for about 2 months now. The sound quality is really great with enough bass response without losing clarity of midtones and treble. I do find these a bit bulky and it feels after listening for long hours. The cord is really really long and should be more than adequate for anyone (In fact, its a hindrance unless kept tied up). Overall a good product worth the price.Update - Lasted me for almost 2 years, after that one speaker stopped working"
3,Head Crusher,If you have a bigger head than average I suggest looking for a different set of headphones. I loved these for about 20 minutes and then started to get a headache do to the pressure on either side of my head. The sound is great though!
4,Good Headphones,"AMAZON: Deleivered a day before estimated delivery date. Very happy with service.HEADPHONES: I was skeptical after reading the many great reviews on these bad boys, but let me tell you these are some decent headphones for the price, and in no way should they be compared to Bose or Beats By Dre like some users have, though they are great for the purpose of just providing good music for your ears.Mids and Lows are well balanced if you ask me, but the Highs could use a little bit of tunning; and again for the price these are great!ONE CAVEAT: Might be tight for big noggins!!!I use L/XL ball caps and these puppies are a bit tight, you have to physically adjust them to a lower setting to loosen em' up but it really doesn't bother me too much.Also since these are over the ear type of a headset, they're bound to stay warm, but that's a plus IMO!"
5,Best Over-the Ear Headphones I've bought...Ever,"I don't wanna hype it up but, I believe these are one of the best over the ear headphones I have tried in a long time. The cord is super long which can be kind of annoying but that's not really a problem considering they give this plastic cord roller thing. It's by Sennheiser which I know are a well renowned brand. When I use these headphones I can't even hear anyone which might be bad if people are talking to you but for airplane trips and loud areas, they are perfect. When my friend tried these headphones on full blast, as soon as he put it on his ears, you can hear absolutely no leakage. The sound quality is amazing and would even compare them to the Klipsche S4. Bas is outstanding as well as Tremble. Get these headphones. I got them at an amazing price from amazon. Do not miss out. Hope you like your product and hope this helps."
3,good BUT flimsy feel,"i love the brand.. i love these headphones... and for the price, they ARE a good deal... but i would expect better quality plastic/build from sennheiser..the speakers are attached to the headband with a very thin plastic.. everything plastic on these headphones feel flimsy..the cord is very thin and feels cheap.. for a cord that long, i 'd expect a thicker cord....sound quality is good... everything else, not so good.. i dont know how long they will last so i cant say for sure.but i can say that they dont FEEL (look ok) very high quality when you hold them in your hand ...i will nto return them as the price is good.. but again.. not very happy either."
3,good sound...ear cups too small.. good value,My only complaint is my ear will not fit into the over-the-ear cuffs provided: making the device uncomfortable.
3,Great value,I wish the cord length was less. It is loooonnnng. I also wish it had better bass. For the price I recommend it 100%. Very comfortable.
1,"Do not buy it, choose another one.","At first, I think it will be a good headphone at this price. However, it turns out that I am wrong. It is really uncomfortable when you put it around your ears after a couple of minutes. While for headphones, the comfort should come first. So I would rate this for just one star. You shall pay a litter more to get one to make you enjoy it."
3,decent headphones,"The Sennheiser HD 202 headphones are decent headphones. The sound is very good, but not quite as good as the bose over the ear headphones. Comfort is the main problem with these cans. Again, I found the bose to be more comfortable than the Sennheiser. But for the price, you can't beat it. If you have the money, go bose."
3,Nice Economical Set of Headphones,"Nice set of headphones for the money. The sound is passable, the durability is on par with more costlier sets, and they are very comfortable to wear."
4,Good headphones,"For the price these are good headphones. They are a bit uncomfortable as they do not fully fit over the ears. I am using these for my computer and I don't think they are intended for this purpose as they do not have a volume control on them, so you have to rely on the control whatever site gives you. They do sound good, and for 20 some dollars I don't know if you could find much better. Oh, and very durable thus far. I go through headphones like candy, but these are holding up."
2,Hurts my ears,"Not much more to say other than these headphones have a vice-like grip on my head and it kills my ears to wear them. Have no complaints about the sounds quality, etc, but the rigid plastic on the top that connects the headphones makes for quite the uncomfort"
4,Great set of headphones for the price.,"These headphones sound great. Since I am a typical consumer, I can't really distinguish the audio quality between these and most other over-ear headphones. I do however have a couple of comments. The headphones are a bit too tight. I have a slightly wider than usual head so after a solid 30 minutes of use, I have to take these off. Another thing not entirely apparent when I first purchased this is the cord. It's really long and comes attached with a plastic spool! It's not ideal for office use because the spool ends up moving around a lot but it is still usable.For the cost though, I can't complain. I use it daily in the office in 30 minute stretches."
3,Fit was too tight,"The audio quality from the HD202 was great, the head cushion was nice as well. Its just that the fit was too tight (maybe not sennheiser's fault, but still counts as a negative), and the fact that I wear glasses only made it worse.Be sure to try these out in a shop to see if they fit you properly, if they do, then they're absolutely great headphones."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book on the strength of its good reviews but was disappointed. It did not deliver the depth of information which I expected. A much better coverage of related issues can be found in Dennet's ""Promise of sleep""."
1,Seriously?,"I paid $1.11 + shipping, and I feel I overpaid. The glowing 5 star reviews led me to buy this book, thinking it was a revolutionary new thought process in managing my health regimen. I'm already aware that such a clock governs the rhythms of my body, my life, and the planet, this from my own experience and from extensive study. Maybe that's why I found nothing new or of particular interest between its pages. I mean, all the ""recommendations"" are common sense and can be found with any quick Google search. I kept scanning and scanning, trying to get to the meat of the thing, and then I was at the end pages.I'll leave it on the FREE shelves in the lobby of our public library. Maybe someone else, to whom this concept is truly an epiphany, can get my $1.11 worth of good out of it."
4,Just What I thought i purchased,"The book arrived as described (used, a bit mildewy) but very readible (: This is a very informative book but i wish it were longer and had even more information in it. i read it all in about 1 hr."
3,Not enough as I wanted.,"Good information and tips, but most of them already known before. However, it`s ok if you know absolutely anything about body cycles"
5,Flattering on the belly,"I have put on a lot of weight in the last five years -went from a 5'2 100 girl to up to 180- working hard to get it off, then I gain it back. Throw in a couple of pregnancies, and well, I have a gut that isn't really pretty anymore. I still want to enjoy my private life and being pregnant there's not much I can do about my belly until I deliver...so I just wanted to say finding lingerie that looks good over ALL of me is hard thanks to my tummy in particular...this is the first piece I've bought that actually hides my flaws and brings out my good aspects. It covers the tummy well, makes it appear flatter and doesn't show any odd shape to it. It's sheer, but not sheer enough to make your midsection look weird if you have a flawed one. Now you just need nice breasts and you're good to go. It's really a good piece and was a huge hit with my husband. It is pretty good quality fabric, fit, and attractiveness."
2,teddy,I am a size 18 and this did not fit well at all! Loved the color (but what good is that if you can't wear it).
4,Fits well!,This is a very sexy teddy that fits well. I think it sizes run true so it should fit well. Hand wash and enjoy!
3,Teddy,"I do like the teddy but was dissapointed that the wrap that shows in the picture did not come with it. I feel like this was false advertisement as the product was not sent as shown, I was well satisfied with the speed with which the item arrived."
4,Pretty Good,"I really love this show, and the first season is the only one I have so far in my Frasier DVD collection. Not much to say about it really, has all the episodes and the ""celebrity voices"" bit on each DVD that shows the scenes on that disk and who the voice is. Pretty cool feature, but I could trade that in for a ""play all"" option. That is my biggest issue with this set, because it just returns you to the main screen when each episode finishes. Kind of an inconvenience, but what can you do."
5,Love this episode,"I love to travel by RV, so I really like this episode. And Daphne's ""American accent"" cracks me up. She is so funny! I love Frasier and the show always delivers."
3,Episode cut short,"This episode is only 20 min 3 sec long. The final scene is missing. The previous episode had a similar problem. Before buying, make sure the episodes are 23 minutes long. Hopefully Amazon can correct this problem."
5,frasier,"this was a christmas gift, and the item was packaged well, quick shipment and was a great surprise to the recipient. thanks"
3,why no subtitles?,i absolutely love Frasier but continue to be disappointed with many region1 dvds that do not have subtitles....can someone a reason??? i'm forced to purchase region2 DVDs for that reason - i have a deaf brother and subtitles are a must
3,great season,"I love frasier, this show is awesome. Having it on DVD is soooooooooooo cool, the bonus features are pretty cool too.now the reasons I gave it only, 3 stars.1. no captions, I don't normally use them, but some times I like to turn them on, some times it's hard to tell exactly what was said.2. no episode descriptions, it's nice to have a brief description of the episode before you watch it.but all in all, it's a good buy for a Frasier fan."
4,Please add subtitles for foreing viewers,"This DVD is excelent. The show is clever and funny. For the next seasons I would ask the DVD producers to add subtitles in spanish, french and english because the show is watched in many other countries."
5,"Finally, a show for smart people!","This show is brilliant. Witty writing, timeless characters, and storylines that just pull you in. I'm not sure I even saw the 1st season when it originall aired... there are some real gems in this season that shouldn't be missed!"
3,Good Frasier Bad Image Quality,"Season 1 is an Epic season for Frasier. All the characters coming together and getting to know Martin. When i purchased this i purchased seasons 2 and 3 as well. I have seen all the episodes via reruns from local networks over the years but want to have a backup. When i popped in the dvd and started the episode i was unpleasantly surprised how bad the image quality is, and i have an old standard def. tv. One of my local tv networks shows reruns and the quality is better. I loaded season 2 in and it was a little better. The biggest improvement was season 3 were i could even play it on my computer and the image quality was still good.This still shouldnt deter anyone from getting season 1 on dvd just a heads up."
5,What's not to love?,"Having purchased the first 4 seasons of Cheers and watched and enjoyed the great writing and laugh out loud comedy, decided to then start with the Frasier collection. Another winner! This kind of acting and writing is a treasure and glad I own some of it. Not much out there today, if any, can touch it!"
5,Hilarious,"I am so glad that this TV series is on DVD! I have watched every season over and over again, and it never really gets old. The snide, sarcastic remarks, the witty criticisms , and the insanely hilarious acting all make up an excellent TV show."
1,Wheres season 1 episode 13 ?,So what happened to episode 13. Kinda annoying.Other than that its a great show. Amazon please fix this annoying error.
2,No captioning is UTTERLY inexcusable!!,"Paramount needs to be told just what a COLOSSAL blunder it was not to include any captioning of any sort on these DVD's. It isn't just inexcusable--for this particular show with all the foreign words and elevated language--it's a downright TRAVESTY!!There is NO excuse for this. NONE! This is the ONLY DVD I have EVER seen with no captioning at all, and it needs it more than almost any other TV show. This is a fatal flaw. Let Paramount know how unacceptable this is!"
1,"not as good as ""CHEERS""","""Frasier"" is ok, but it can't hold a candle to its forefather ""CHEERS"", which in my opinion is the greatest show of all time."
5,Absolutely worth every penny!!!,This is great for fans of Frasier. Excellent!!! They don't show the reruns of the first season too much anymore. I cant wait until all of the seasons are on DVD format.
1,The DVD did not play,The DVD will play for five minutes and then stop playing. I had to advance the DVD to get it to play again for another five minutes. Then it will stop playing and I advance it again. Then over and over I had to repeat this in order to play the DVD.
1,Such a horrible plot,"This movie was utterly ridiculous. I saw it because I like Ving Rhames, and it was filmed in Pittsburgh, where I went to school. While it shows a lot of good shots of the city, this movie was so bad.It made absolutely no sense. There were drugs and prostitution, random guns, but there was no plot. The characters were all throw-aways, with no redeeming qualities to make me like any of them. Ultimately, the ending flat out sucked. It was confusing and had no basis to occur."
2,MCSE Flop,"When I opened this book, I thought it would be a flop, god, was I right! It starts off talking about how this book will get you through the exam. I couldn't see how THAT will get you through the exam alone, if you decide that you want read this to prepare you for an MCSE exam, I recommend taking a boot camp to prepare you aswell. Overall, this book is not recommended. 2 stars"
5,Bambino in Southern Africa,"For Spencer fans this is a great movie to add to the collection, along with the first Piedone movie as well as Flatfood in HongKong. This movie begins in Naples and ends up in Namibia (South West Africa at time of filming). The flow of the movie is its outstanding feature, never pausing or relenting on following the storyline and theme. Little Bodo, Spencer's tiny sidekick in the movie is adorable and steals many scenes. Naturally, Spencer's Barney Fife like deputy adds ridiculous humor and frustrating turns to the scenes as he does in all the Piedone movies. The audience finds Spencer piloting his own 'plane, and as usual, being extraordinarily resilient and resourceful in all situations. A really good addition to any Spencer movie collection."
1,only for school only for school,"This boring look at the Industrialization of Europe by the railroad will have you hating to turn the page. It is horrifying, read 20 pages take a break (probably a nap) then try and read 20 more."
4,The Tracks of the Diva,"Bellini's ""Qui la voce ... Vien diletto"" from I PURITANI is Ms. Scotto's best track, I believe. With one exception, all of the others are highly competent, and Scotto has a rich, warm soprano voice that does very well with Puccini's melodies. The one track that disappointed me is of Rossini's ""Una voce poco fa"" (IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA): being a soprano, Scotto chose in an early key passage to take a higher note in place of the ""correct"" mezzo note. After listening to that track about 15 times, I found I was growing accustomed to this ""flaw."" What I could not overlook, though, was the sour note she hits about 15 seconds from the end. I wish that she and her conductor had either redone that track or had recorded a ""patch"" to be inserted to fix it. Even so, I'd rate that track a ""C"" (and I'd rate Kathleen Battle's recording of that aria much below that). Overall, this is a worthy CD for opera fans' collections."
3,SCOTTO MISTAKE OF A VOICE,LA SCOTTO SOPRANO-LEGGERO FINO AL 1968 CON SOPRACUTI SIMILI A PUNTE DI SPILLO DOPO.....A FURIA DI IMITARE LA CALLAS SI E' ROVINATA LA VOCE .IN DISCO......E' FACILE !!!!!!!!!
5,patio spinner,"Love, love, love the spinner which hangs on my patio. Slighest breeze and it delights the viewer. Made very well, looks great and will purchase more for added fun from Amazon. Sandy from Arizona"
5,Very Impressed,We purchased these after reading the reviews and we are very satisfied. They make a fantastic addition to the yard. Highly visible from a distance and they don't require much of a breeze to keep them spinning. A little expensive but worth the price. Just don't hang them close to anything they can make contact with.
5,Windspinner,I own one of these and ordered this one for my sister-in-law in Arizona. Amazon sent the windspinner promptly in a well-packaged carton.
3,This is NOT Copper ~ don't expect a beautiful patina,"I purchased this item after having a very similar product for 7 years that was made out of copper and had developed a beautiful patina.I have had this hanging on my porch for maaaaaaybe 2 years and it is rusting at the junctures. Can't tell from a distance, but had I known it wasn't actually copper, I would not have made this purchase."
3,In the garden,"We bought the Red Carpet Studios Cosmix Round Ring Yard Stand Display, 54-Inch Tall with the 20 inch Cosmix Double-- well, didn't know we'd have to adjust it to the stand's round ring--should have gotten the smaller one. We adjusted the hanging chain, so now it hangs properly. I thought it would turn more with a little wind. It does look pretty in the yard."
4,"Difficult to follow, but a good source anyway","The title of this book speaks for itself. The author tells the story of the land wars in Lincoln involving Billy the Kid. While more realism than fantasy in content, I found it difficult to follow. There were too many characters introduced - down the names of camp cooks - and the author used more of a adventure story tone than I am used to in historical texts. Still, the book is highly informative of the period, so feel free to delve into the wild west!"
3,Interesting Snapshot of Frontier Violence,"Mr. Utley's High Noon in Lincoln is an interesting book. Most of us have some idea that the western frontier could be a violent place from movies and stories read in our youth. But very few know of any of the real escapades that helped generate the material for the likes of Zane Gray, John Wayne or Clint Eastwood. Mr. Utley's book chronicles one of the most infamous episodes of western violence, the Lincoln County Range War.This book is well researched and introduces many charactors (Lew Wallace, Pat Garrett, Billy the Kid and John Henry Tunstall to name a few). It is a solid chronology of the disputes and charactors that made Lincoln County a lawless, murderous place for a few years in the late 1870's. Warning for those expecting someone to be wearing a white hat in this tale, there is no romance in this telling of the old west."
3,This Bike. >:-(,"I received this bike as a Christmas gift. Not even a month after I have used it it makes this thumping noise as I peddle. I called Life Gears HORRIBLE customer service number only to have them tell me I need new ball bearings. They say they will not send you directions, and I have to call them back to have them walk me through the steps. Its ridiculous.I loved this bike when I first got it, yes the seat was a little uncomfortable but it's working out! Who cares! It was quiet and easy to assemble for my boyfriend took him under an hour.I am really sad :( this bike has broken my workout regime!!!"
4,"nice bike, nice price","I was pretty impressed with the bike. I wish the seat was a little more comfortable and I wish the display wasn't so cheap, but overall I am very pleased. It is really quiet and smooth. I get a nice workout. For the price, this is a very good bike."
4,Good bike,"I bought this bike for my wife. She assembled it. It took around 4-5 hrs. She did it alone. I was quite amazed, because i find assembling such a difficult job.There were 2 problems:-(a) Seat needed more washers. We have ordered and yet to getthem.(b) The tension was not working. After speaking with the customer service we got it fixed.I would recommend this bike to others."
3,not a quality product--you get what you pay for!,"The bike was easy to assemble, and it is quiet.After a week, the heart monitor stopped on theleft side. Now it only works when you grab both handles.The length adjustment knob is also broken, it iseither cross threaded or stuck so it no longercan be pulled out for adjustment.But the bike is comfortable and still serves itspurpose. I ride it every other day for 30 minutes.I don't expect any failures in the mechanical portions,those parts seems solid."
5,"Great, great, great!","I bought this recumbent bike just three days ago and it is already at my house and set up! It took my husband about 1 1/2 hours to put it together (if we were younger it probably would have gone faster). The bike is GREAT!! I can't say enough good about it. I don't know how it will hold up, but it seems to be sturdy and so worth the price. As I said, I am no longer so young, but I was able to get on the bike and ride it comfortably on a low setting for more than a mile. The bike kept track of my distance,speed,calories burned, etc. I know that this is an exercise that I can keep up with. I am so happy!"
1,Worked fine for about a month,"Worked fine for about a month (other than being hideously uncomfortable) but then started making chattering and thumping noises. Opening up the case revealed no visible problem and got me nowhere.The discomfort has a lot to do with the fact that the pedal/flywheel unit is welded on askew, so that I have to contort myself a bit while exercising.A very regrettable puchase."
3,bike review,"Got this bike about a month ago, been pretty good so far, put about 80-90 miles on it.Works great for good cardio and endurance building exercises. I jump on it and forget im going when I watch a movie or TV.Only complaint is the seat gets stiff and you get sore after extended use.Overall great for the price!"
2,Bad belt within 24 hours,"Within 24 hours of getting this thing together, the belt was slipping when you pedaled. It was hardly ridden. I have been trying for two weeks to get life gear to replace it, but I keep getting excuses(it's in the mail, we just moved). I am sending back. Otherwise I really liked the bike."
3,was good for a while,"Was good for the first few months, but then slowly started to breakdown. After about a year, some piece came flying off and we just threw it away instead of worrying about fixing it."
2,Not enought power,"I've had this bike for a while and although I do exercise, I hardly use this piece of equipment because it has very little resistance. You can hardly break a sweat at the highest level of resistance. I would not recommend this item, it my be enough resistance for a child but not an adult."
3,Needed modifications to fit,"The All Sales Manufacturing Inc (AMI) fitment showed #6041CL would fit my 2009 dodge ram 1500 but the package I received called for #6042CL. On the AMI website it showed both would fit.To accomplish fitment for the 6041CL I had to elongate one hole on hinge side mount (left-truck body opening) and drill two holes on (right-truck body opening lip). Also, had to remove two parts of the plastic neck liner to accommodate drilling the new holes.Two nuts one at 12-O'clock and 6-O'clock positions had to be ground to allow flush fit on opening recess.Finally the product looks great,after my modifications, but AMI needs to tweak the specifics on application fitment due to differences on model year application.Note to AMI: pkg showed 6041CL to 2008: 2009 showed 6042CL [re: 2009 dodge ram 1500]"
1,oops,"The disc I bought was shipped from England, which meant that it was in District II and couldn't be played by a machine in North America. They were cool about taking it back and giving me a refund, however, and I found it in my public library for free."
5,But I don't want to be the Queen!,"If you are interested in the Tudor dynasty history, here is a little background film into it's workings.It tells the unfortunate tale of a young couple caught in political manipulation.Sad but a true part of history portrayed well by a very young Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes."
4,"Slow in the middle, but a great movie!","I have to admit, although I love the drama of 16th Century England, ""Lady Jane"" exaggerates the life of Jane Grey. But I won't get into detail, because the movie was was excellent... in the beginning and the end. Parts in the middle left me saying ""HURRY UP AND DO SOMETHING!"" because of all the sitting and historic talk. It was actually a bit too historic in the dialogue, but too exaggerated in the acted portrayals... But still, the acting WAS carried out beautifully by Helena Bonham Carter and Cary Elwes, and the costume, hair, make-up and music was absolutely classic. I've been trying to find the soundtrack ever since I first saw the movie. Buy the movie today! You'll like it, and you might learn something."
5,Lady Jane finally on DVD!,"I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it at 15. It made me fall in love with Cary Elwes and Helena Bonham Carter, both superb actors who should get more credit (and more roles!). I love the story, although it is tragic, albeit romantic at the same time. It does not bother me that it is in some respect historically inaccurate. So is ""Braveheart"" and that is my favorite movie of all time. The important thing is this movie made me want to know more, and since first seeing it I have become obsessed with English royalty and history. It is also a very well acted, well written, and well directed historical drama with beautiful costumes. Highly recommended to those who love a movie that's well done."
4,Jane Grey fan,"I own this film on VHS and it's one of the jewels of my collection. I've been a Tudor fan and a Lady Jane Grey fan ever since I watched ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" on CBS in the summer of 1971. I first saw ""Lady Jane"" in 1986 in the theater and never forgot it. Yes, the movie's not accurate in its depiction of Jane Grey and Guilford Dudley, but I was so happy to finally see a movie about her that it didn't bother me, and the couple's ultimate fate was devastating; it resonated deeply with me. I loved the film then and I love it now (especially with Patrick Stewart in a supporting role as Jane's father, Duke Henry Grey)."
5,Bring out the tissues,"The acting is superb and makes you feel that you are part of the action. However you do feel like telling them what to do or say. The story is loosely based on a sixteen-year-old girl Lady Jane Grey (Helena Bonham Garter) on the throne of England for just nine days in 1553, and how everyone tries to manipulate her.The genealogy behind this can get quite complex but the story is strait forward. Naturally the costumes and scenery add to the movie. If there was any music I did not notice it.For those who want historical accuracy, go watch a documentary. That does not make this anything less than great entertainment. It has religion for the religious, love fort the loveless, and teaches us to stick our neck out for our principles.Did I mention that this is an engrossing film?"
3,Sweet movie,"Lovely movie, wonderful acting, but the the love story between Lady Jane and Guilford is not historically correct. If your looking for a love story and just a little history, hollywood style, this is a good movie."
4,"Be careful of ""Family Plans""","This film just goes to show that sometimes your family can be your worst enemy. Ms. Carter was an excellent ""Queen"" Jane and the actress who played ""Bloody"" Mary was outstanding! I am so glad that I was not around in Tudor England!"
5,THANK GOD!!!,"I, for one, am SO very thankful that Lady Jane is now out on DVD. I was obsessed with this movie as a teenager and am so thrilled that I can now own it--instead of watching my worn out recording from TV. (In the past, it's been 100 bucks or so for the VHS version...)Yipee!This is a beautiful film! Although not quite historically accurate, it's a moving love story that will melt hearts!"
3,"""Blue Lagoon"" goes Renaissance","It's a shame that the interesting and relatively untapped story of Lady Jane got this sugary sweet treatment. It alternates between nubile pulp romance and engrossing costume drama. So when it's good, it's very good...and when it's corny, it's ridiculous (even the score is over the top). Excellent supporting cast. DVD offers no compelling special features...it would have been nice to have some extra Tudor treat in there!"
2,could have been better,"The only really interesting thing about this movie were the flashbacks. If they had focused on that, instead of trekking through the woods, it would have been a much better movie. ANd I must have missed the point of this as I watched alot of the movie in fastforward, but what was Vlads purpose in taking and having sex with the one modern day blonde, and then going after the past blonde? Or is this another of those movies where sex and nudity has to be thrown in just because? I was really disapointed in what I thought would be an interesting movie rental."
2,Vlad.....,"OK... it almost kills me to give a 2 star rating to a BILLY ZANE movie!!! Zane gives a Great performance in this film and does a great job with his Romanian accent! This is the reason for the 2 star rating and Zane was the only reason I have this movie. Otherwise, the moving is rather boring and a dracula want to be flick. Not a true vampire movie. I'd only suggest renting this film to see Zane's performance....other than that, I think most people will be disappointed in the overall film."
2,Bring a pillow,"Boring....not much more to say: Lack of action, lack of gore, lack of horror, lack of enthusiasm, lack of energy. If you like to listen to people talk then by all means, get this.Quality of picture and sound was good."
1,WTF!,"I'll put it plain and simple, CRAP!!! These people should stop coming up with their own story line this a piece of you know what. Director's Cut, they should have kept on cutting."
1,hocky,"The transylvania accents sound really phoney; so much so it was almost laughable. The whole story and variations of the theme of the dracula fiction was also absurb. The main theme is some stupid amulet. I just didn't like the movie. The story is too far absurb, and I didn't like the fusion between the old world and the new-all through the amulet ""breaking the wall of time"" It was like mixing two separate themes which totally clashed."
3,great idea but has issues,"I got this hoping to go more green. I am constantly working out and constantly shaving because of this. I go through cheap razor a lot and am worried about the environmental impact. When I saw this I was relieved I could cut down on my impact and possibly save cash too. Unfortunately, the blades on the first razor started to rust after the first use even with applying the cover (which I usually don't do). This did not go over well with me. I thought it could be a fluke but the second blade set did the same."
2,"Love that it's recycled, don't like the shave","I transitioned to this razor after my local store (that sold the Wally shaver & blades) closed down. This razor reminds me of the cheapy disposable razors-the ones that always take a layer of skin off the front of my shin bone when they're sharp, and give me horrible razor burn to boot.I love that they're made of post consumer recycled material, but the blades don't last long, and the shave is not fun about half the time. Maybe it's just me, but I've been shaving for nearly twenty years, and this just doesn't work for me.I'm going back to my Wally-just found it here on Amazon."
4,Works well,The razors work well - no complaints. I didn't expect anything spectacular from my razor. Just simple and effective. Thumps up!
2,Why is the recycled razor packaged in plastic?,"Full disclosure: I haven't even tried this razor yet. I will rate it again afterwards. This rating is solely for the insane three-steps-forward-two-steps-back thinking that went into using plastic packaging for the razor that is selling itself as being made of recycled yogurt containers. It is cute, but I wish this had occurred to me before purchasing. I'm sure there are many others who balked beforehand, as I should have."
3,Preschool curriculum,"This book is just okay. There are some good experiments in here (maybe 10-15)and I had hoped to find at least 30. A lot of this stuff is just plain goofy, but maybe that's what you need for preschoolers, goofy stuff. I wanted implement it into my son's kindergarten homeshool curriculum and there just isn't a lot of good hands on science books out there for this age group (4-6). Well, not without spending a lot of money. I'm using several sources for science. But I did get this book for just a few dollars, so it was worth that price."
2,Too Many Supplies Needed,"For kids so little, I wasn't looking for a science book that would involve so many supplies. I personally just don't have 20 cartons of milk hanging around my house. I enjoyed Science Play by Little Hands more because it involved less supplies and more exploring outdoors."
2,Terrible recordings of great songs.,"The song selecting is awesome, but the performances and recordings (or the remastering) are awful. The balance seems off (very tinny sound), and the musicianship is weak (Vivaldi's ""Summer"" sounds like eigth-notes!).NOTE: this review is for my CD from the BMG music club. I don't know if the CDs are different from what Amazon sells."
2,"3D does not always equal ""improvement""","The original Lode Runner was endearing because it was so simple--left, right, up, down, blaster, holes. In this version, the player has to use direction-specific bombs to open walls, hide in little ""invisible"" cubes, avoid monks with different agendas. . .It all gets tiresome after several levels.More maddening is the apparent disconnect between keystroke actions and Lode Runner actions. Several times, I thought I timed my jump, turn, or climb perfectly, only to find that the program did not detect the keyboard interrupt (input) for a second or two--long enough to guarantee level failure. Moreover, it's easy to mis-hit a direction key (instead of the usual four direction keys, you get eight--twice the opportunity for error).In sum, you might want to investigate other side-scrolling action games. This one is just too fraught with nuisances, keyboard bugs, and needless complications."
3,Complicated,A lot of the advice in this book is useful but the make-up and beauty tips are a little complicated for younger teens and a lot of the information inside can be found in the regular magazines.
2,IM I4 READ BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS. THIS IS ONLY OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"before u start reading this review, u should no that im 14, i just dint want 2 rite my email adress cuz they would send me a bunch of SPAM!i bought this product thinking that it would give me ideas of how to do my hair and wat the best type of makeup is the best and stuff, but all it pretty much said was the best way to do ur makeup and crap wen everybody already nows how to do there makeup! im wearing braces and there was an article in there that said ""do u hate ur braces?"" i bought the book cuz of that article, ubt it just told u 2 not draw2 much attention 2 them by applying lip balm 2ice a day! it was ok in some parts,the book was okay, but in others, it sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great sound. Excellent buy for the sale price.,"Sound quaility is pretty good. Perfect fit for my ears (Avg Size). Don't feel any pain at all while wearing for a extended period of time. Initally there was a little unexplicable discomfort, now I don't feel that.Lot of people mentioned about the quality of music getting better and better as you use it. That created a little bit of high expectations. I haven't felt that way. Its the same quality from the beggining.I would strongly recomend this for any music lovers who wants to get good sound for a less price. For me I would probably go for a high end model the next time."
2,Returned becuase of comfort,"Great sound, very lightweight. But even after breaking them in for 3 weeks I had to send them back. I'd say I have average size ears, but these still placed too much pressure on the ear and I couldn't stand to wear them for more than 45 minutes."
2,"Should be called ""on ear"" headphones","The sound quality of the 497's is superb, but I found them to be very uncomfortable. They do not fit over the entire ear (and I have small ears) - I found they had to be situated to squish part of your ear because the cup is not wide enough to engulf the ear. If you don't mind the cup pressing part of your ear against your head, you will love these."
2,I find the sound quality questionable.,"Aside from the fact that your ears will hate you while wearing these for the first few hours of their lifespan (as they conform to your ears), I find the sound quality questionable. Compared to my Sennheiser PMX60 Headphones which I bought later on (for half the price mind you), the sound here is slightly muffled and distorted, which is unacceptable to me. The durability and volume strength seem nice, but I don't even bother using these anymore when my PMX60 sounds noticeably better."
3,"Very good sound, but not very comfortable","Overall, these are fairly good headphones -- very nice sound, cool styling, etc. However, they aren't that comfortable. When wearing for an extended period of time (30+ mins) your ears have that uncomfortable feeling that's supposed to come from really cheap headphones. This may be because the earpieces don't cover the entire ear or the headphones will not loosen enough or both but this isn't what I really expected from Sennheiser. Nonetheless, the sound is still good (when listening to some of my favorite music I have noticed things I never heard before), they look cool, and the price is right."
4,Not Bad,"These headphones are not bad at all for the money ($40). They sound a little brassy at times and they don't have the bass of the HD 570's (when you turn up the HD 570's way up). But they don't sound shabby at all. The only thing I didn't like about these headphones are the pleather pads which don't feel as nice as velvet pads, but wearing these 497's for hours is no problem, and also the fact that the jack is nickel-plated and not gold so sometimes the balance is thrown off, but it's nothing a little jack twisting won't fix."
4,"Somewhat uncomfortable, but good sound","These headphones start to become uncomfortable after 15-20 minutes of use. It gets too warm and also hurts my ears. The bass really is weak at first, but it greatly improves after some use. The highs are pretty good right out of the box."
3,Painful,"I use these fairly often, and although I have been impressed with the sound, I must agree with other reviewers who suggest the fit is nothing short of painful if worn more than 15 minutes or so. I have tried stretching the plastic headband, which helped a little, but after 15 to 30 minutes, my ears hurt too much to continue wearing them. I have a relatively large head, and relatively large ears for that matter, which is why I'll give these 3 stars out of five -- if they happen to fit you, you will likely enjoy them very much! Good luck."
4,Bought it after reading NYT review,"I bought these headphones after reading this review in the New York.The NYT reviewer said they were on par with a Bose model but much cheaper. I've been using them for a week listening to MP3s off of my Mac and iPod, and I think they sound great. They are crisp with clean solid bass and good dynamic range. My only complaint is that with my big ears, the pads sometimes feel tight and warm during longer listening sessions."
4,questions,"Could anybody help me? It is said the 9ft cable of this headphone is detachable, but I do not know how to do it. Also is there any way to change/or extend the cable to be like 12ft. Thanks! A beginner"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this headphone for use with my desktop and laptopcomputers. I thought for a $35.00 headphone, the least Ican expect is a clear sound. But to my surprise, the soundquality is horrible, this is definitely not a $35.00 headphone. In fact, I wouldn't spend more than $3 for this kindof quality. Stay away from this head phone unless you likewasting your money"
4,"Great sound, minimal fuss","The headphones sound great, I have been using them off and on for almost a year now (not as constantly as a true audiophile though). A lot of people mention about the cups being uncomfortable on the ears. This is true in my case as well. BUT I have found that if you put the top of the headphones around the back of your head instead of the top of your head, this will reduce the pressure on your ears a little bit. If it REALLY bothers you, but still want to use the headphones for prolonged amounts of time, just take them off for a minute or two every hour or so and put them back on again to let your ears stretch out.The cord on these headphones is very long. Keep it wrapped up in a bread twist if you have to use the headphones while moving around.Sound and value = 5 starscomfort = 4 starsdesign (cord) = 4 starsOVERALL 4 stars"
5,Awesome Headphones,These are by far the best value headphones on the market. So far I can't say anything bad about them. Awesome headphones.
3,"Great sound, great price, but durability?","I got these for Christmas in 2002. They far surpassed, in sound quality, any headphones I had ever donned. The price had been reasonable and they were very comfortable. About a month ago, however, the left earpiece pad fell off; hardly a week later, the sound started flickering in that half of the headphones, and a few days later I had to spend 10 minutes adjusting the cord for both ears to play, only to be shaken and restart. Hopefully yours will be more durable."
3,Reconsider,"When I bought these headphones, I expected them to fit perfectly around my ear and deliver clear sound and good bass, just like reviews say. But, it WAS NOT what I had expected. It's sound was clearer than my original Panasonic's that came with my CD Player, but the bass was only a small bit better. It did NOT fit all the way around my ear and I have small ears. The width of the earcups are about 3.5-4cm. Not much boom for your buck, even for the $44 I got it for."
4,"Satisfying sound, a bit plastic looking","I bought my 497's from Amazon about 3 months ago, and overall I'm happy. Audio performance is quite good for a sub-$50 set of cans, although it doesn't have the really deep bass that I look for (but I listen to hip hop and rap so this may not be an issue for you).If I had anything to gripe about, it would be that the construction seems a bit too plasticy. The headband, which is all plastic, can't be adjusted (the phones themselves slide up and down on the headband) and after wearing for more than an hour, I find them too tight. Durability seems good though and the plastic makes them quite light as well."
5,Amazing Sound!!! Not for on the go use however...,"I got these about a year and a half ago. When I first got them I was very surprised by the weight, they were so light!Then I tried them on, they were pretty comfortable. Then I plugged them in...WOW. The sound is incredibly clear and transparent. I loved it. I'm no audiophile, but I can hear when something's crap. These aren't. The are great for playing video games or just relaxing to music. The sound seemed balanced (ie, not bass-heavy or very bright treble), but then again, I'm no audiophile.But, I don't recommend these outside your house, or, depending on how critical the people you live with are, outside of your room for that matter. I have a normal sized head and these look ridiculous on me. They make my head look gigantic. Also, the cord is really long, and your ears can get a bit sweaty.Overall, however, great 'phones!"
4,good for the money,"I use them for working out at the gym. Definitely better quality than any earbud type of headphone, including top of the line ones. They sound better and they don't come out of your ears. Great value for the money. Keeps most noise out and almost no sound leakage."
5,First rate headphones! Third rate cord!,These headphones are just great. Never thought headphones could sound this good. You can barely feel them when worn and it even beats my Logitech Z-5300 speakers hands down. The only problem with them that I can see is that the detachable headphone cord is very cheap both visualy and to the touch. My $20 sony pair has a really great cord compared to this thing. I mean you can easily say that it construction is not all that great. Its probably Sennheiser's attempt to sell replacement cords over the lifetime of these and make more money. Other than the cord great headphones for this price. I think they sound better than the Bose Triport even though then are less than half price.
2,Not worth it,"This headset seems like the ultimate gaming device; talk with your friends online while playing and ""feeling"" the game through the headsets vibration functions. It's disappointing. The mic itself is very poor quality. With system settings and chat program volume (Ventrilo to talk with guild mates) no one could hear me at all. And the vibration is a big let down. I was expecting ""vibration"" not a minute amount of bass coming from the headphones. I get more function out of my subwoofer at half power than these things do at max settings. Gamers, if you want a good set of headphones, look elsewhere. Try looking for ones that offer good bass feedback, not ""vibration."""
1,"Didn't work from the start, and no support","This headset did not work properly from the start.1) No computers (running OSX or Windows XP) were able to even recognize these headphones as either an output or an input device. Thus, you can't even select it as an input.2) There's no CD or software or drivers that accompany the product, and the company website does not have any mention of it either.3) There is a thumping static sound coming from the headphones, even when the vibration feature is turned off.4) I never cared about this feature, but the vibration never ever worked.This is one of the most poorly designed products I have ever seen."
1,Have Not Yet Received my Shipment,I am very upset because it has been 30 days and I have not received my shipment. No one has contacted me to let me know what the hold up is.
3,Ben's Game,Simple to play at first just keep the infantry and tanks from landing on the beach while you defend from aircraft and attacking ships.
3,"Remember, it's a 2002 game!","Sure, this little game can't hold a candle to those that have come out in the last 5 years, as far as graphics goes. But it's tough to get through the whole thing even at beginner level. Knocking plans out of the sky with realistic bullet trajectory is interesting. Blowing up a big battleship's guns and letting it slowly drift away is another kick. Then all the little soldiers try to get onto your island while you're busy shooting at planes, battleships, and other ship. For less than $8, it's worth a try, IF you can find it. You can turn of the blood and turn down the sound of the screams if they bother you."
4,"Useful and reliable, but very introductory","I bought and read this book as part of my self-education program on Islam. It turned out to be not nearly as detailed as I had expected, especially in its discussion of the tenets of Islam and their application(s) in the modern world. The principal point of the book is to refute the popular perception of Islam as a monolith bent on clashing with and destroying Christianity and/or the West. Still, as far as it goes it is a very useful introduction, both reliable and objective, and, as others have noted, superior to Karen Armstrong and far superior to Robert Spencer.(When I was in junior high school in the early '60s, the perceived threat to the U.S. was communism, and wanting to learm more about that pressing issue I bought a book by J. Edgar Hoover on communism. Needless to say, it wasn't very helpful, although it took me several years to come to that realization. Reading a book by Robert Spencer to learn about Islam would not be much different.)"
5,I'm so glad I found this!,"This book provides a great deal of information on beginning and sustaining a macrobiotic diet and is written in a clear, concise manner. It speaks positively about small dietary changes and never stoops to belittling other diets. When I bought the book, I knew absolutely nothing about the macrobiotic way of life. When I put it down, I had a good working knowledge.Although it doesn't include any recipes, I think this book is excellent."
4,Making Waves,"This book was a very pleasant suprise for me. I am not going to rave about it and compare it to Dune or other science fiction classics, but if you are looking for a decent underwater adventure with oodles of good ideas and excellent character development then snatch up a copy of DOME-(if you can find one).The plot moves very quickly and their is enough action to easily sustain this novel-and their are a lot of books out there I have spent more money on and enjoyed less-well worth the price of admission."
4,Still Remember It!,I read this book a long time ago but I could never remember the title until I saw the cover art. This was a wonderful book and a good introduction to the SF genre for a then teenager. I highly recommend it for any up and coming young readers or older ones who want an enjoyable read.
4,USED CORRECTLY,this tortilla fryer works very well if used correctly - DO NOT put the tortilla inside the basket. Place the tortilla on top of the hot oil and press the basket into it. the tortilla will shape itself around the outside of the basket...
4,Great but broken,"Figurine is very nicely made. Only problem is one came with a broken back leg in box. I ordered 2 and I'm getting married so the Rottie figurines will be my wedding Cake topper, I don't have time to send back and wait for a new one.. I called the company and explained the issue hoping they could maybe deduct something from my cc, and they never called me back and I have Too much going on, planning my wedding to worry about it when I glue it and be done, overall figurine is adorable. Company obviously isn't the greatest in getting back to the customer."
3,Great music at least.,"I bought this dvd mainly for Brant's music and because i love the feeling and atmosphere of the desert. The music is great, maybe a bit too low key at times. The photography gets somewhat annoying after a while with speedy cuts, a lot of fast forwarding and long shots of a blond girl just walking around in the desert or posing in front of big rocks.It feels almost necessary to be stoned or extremely tired when watching this movie, otherwise you will get bored out of your mind. At least that's the conclusion me and my friends came up with.There are some very nice shots in this movie, but the main feeling is just that someone who is into art made like a holiday video or documentary about Brant and the desert.The one thing i love about this movie is the ability to play the songs in the menu, so you don't have to fast forward in the movie to hear a song you like."
5,languid smiles,"Wow. It grooves and flows. It brings languid smiles.It washes over you like that fourth nitrous hit. Light a candle, turn up the volume, put down that burrito, and get happy.This piece is mildly narcotic -- Relax, you'll love it."
5,metal connector,"I had bought several plastic connectors that kept cracking.Being made of metal, I won't have to worry about this 1 cracking"
4,Frommers Alaska's Ports of Call 2001,This book was very informative. It tells of many interesting things to do that you would never think about doing as well as approximate costs of shore excursions. I am glad I own it.
5,Frommer's Alaska Cruises & Ports of Call,"We read Frommer's Alaska Cruises & Ports of Call in preparation for an educational cruise we had booked. The book described our particular ship, including its strong points and weak points. It helped us pack the appropriate attire, since it was not a formal cruise. Best of all, the authors reviewed the various ports of call and what to expect in each. They described the on-shore excursions, including prices. It was clear that some tours were not worth the time or money. We felt well prepared to start this great trip."
1,Buy With Caution,"I gave this one star mainly because I can't imagine anyone except a narrow-scope scholar needing to know these abstract, religious, and archaic terms. It seems it would be useless in ordinary situations in Sri Lanka or India. In other words, this is a CLASSICAL Tamil dictionary. In addition, those rare scholars will need magnified lenses to read the Tamil script in each entry. I returned this book immediately and bought the much more practical, relevant, and reasonably-priced Collins dictionaries on Amazon-UK."
2,The Forgotten Front,"I had high hopes for this book. However, after reading it I found that there was very little new information added to the subject matter and most was from the British point of view. There are already numerous other books which covers World War One in German East Africa and they are more entertaining. I came away from the book with the question if the Gen. Lettow Vorbeck and the schutztruppe were never victorious, then why did it take the Allies four years to defeat them? Anderson's first book on the Battle of Tanga was more informative and added new information which was missing from the other sources. However, in closing the book is well researched and documented and a new reader of the subject would well be advised to have it in their library."
4,Every Thing I feel,"I love Everything I feel, I remember back in the days when the Drag Queens would do that song at the club on show nights"
5,IluvmesumDatra!!,Datra Hicks is a person I have been following since she was on Broadway. I love her!! I bought this cd solely for You Make Me Want To Give It Up. I have loved this song since I was in high school and I couldn't find it anywhere! Thank you to the Amazon sellers who have made it available!
5,Land Girls Series 3,Loved it. It was just as good are better than 1 & 2. Lokingn forward to another one. Hope their will be one in the coming future.
3,For Bikers Only,"You may never find music better suited to outlaw culture than this nasty little ditty - could have been the Hells Angel's Anthem. Punk at its foul-mouthed best. Play it LOUD and hang on. Not exactly a treasure... more a novelty than a musical tour de force. Same song on both sides and the cover/linernotes aren't exactly great literature.It's waaay out of print so good luck finding a copy. A 45 RPM 12"" disk is all I've seen ( I happen to have one but not intending to sell it)"
1,duped,"i think that i could have put together a better movie when i was a teenager. it seemed like a really bad play. i was duped by a obviously fake 5 star review ( haha you got me...good job). me and my girlfriend just happened to be in the mood for some indy, low budget movie. i'm doing this as a favor to anyone else who sees that 5 star... do not rent this movie. i can honestly say that i find myself laughing with her about it to this day. subject matter is not funny at all, but the the high school production quality is laughable. also, the weird attempt at humor with the guy asking for a certain beer at the liqour store... so weird. then such a creepy turn and too much detail with another child molester... @$%#ed up movie and horribly made."
5,Breath Taking,"This is now my favorite movie of all time,period.That includes all American movies as well so you know this movie must be pretty good considering I am an American who only speaks ENGLISH.This flick is done right,Jet Li and Yen are amazingly quick together in thier stick brawling scenes, and it is truly a pleasure to watch.But what added a great sense of suspense to the movie was the White Lotus cult,these guys are nuts,if you see the first scene then youll know what I mean,especailly when the two guys eat the sticks on fire(close up and all) and their priest deflects sword attacks and gets kicked in the nuts viciously by his students to demonstrate invincibility(but of course not to Wong Fei Hung).There was also alot of violence and the cults songs are almost hypnotizing ,especially the blind man's,I CANT GET THEM OUT OF MY HEAD!YOU MUST OWN THIS MOVIE KUNGFU FAN OR NOT."
4,Arguably the best of the series....,"I picked this one up as I heard that it's the best movie in the series, as well as one of Jet Li's best movies in general; that statement is really only half right. It is most likely the best in the series, essentially due to the intricate fight scenes choreographed by none other than ""The Man"" Yuen Woo Ping. Unfortunately, all of the movies in this series suffer in the same manner as the build-up to the fights is rather boring and extensive; i.e. the stories are nothing to write home about. In actuality, my favorite movie with Jet Li depicting Wong Fei Hung would be ""Last Hero in China"", which is officially not even a part of the OUATIC series. Watch this flick for Donnie Yen; if you want to see more entertaining work by Jet Li check out ""Fist of Legend"" or ""Kung fu Cult Master""."
4,Jet Li and Donnie Yen!!,"Watch this movie if only for the fact that Donnie Yen and Jet Li are in it. The two greatest pure Wu Shu practitioners of our time duking out. The story is weak, but it at least moves us along to the next action sequence. The charisma exuded by the two leads is contagious and well worth a watch....or three...."
5,Excellent sequel!,"Every bit as good as the first, if not better. Jet Li's poise and martial arts ability are astounding and are generously displayed in the superb fight sequences towards the end. Throughout the film the audience is treated to an excellent picture of the cultural and social problems facing China at the turn of the century, as well as some exposure to Eastern medicine. My only personal disappointment is that Yuen Biao, a major actor in the first film and a fantastic martial artist in his own right, does not appear in this sequel. Overall, stunning!"
3,Still Kickin',"I really enjoyed Once Upon a Time in China. Naturally I was interested to see what direction the filmmaker would take the sequal. It was not a good as the first, but none the less a fantastic martial arts display.Li is Wong Fei Hong, a renowned matial artist, this time around traveling with his companions when he becomes entangled with a revolutionary group called the White Lotus Sect. They are calling for the expulsion of all foreigners from China. This leads some to fantastic fight sequences which certainly lived up to the first film.I think martial arts fans will get a terrific kick out of this movie. Other fans, well, I don't know. However I will definatly check out the third film in this series because I liked this one."
3,Nothing like the first,"Although I am a new fan of Jet Li, I thought this movie was not as good as the first one. The action sequences were great, but lacking and didn't show up until the last 30 minutes or so. The plot was also a mixed bag. I recommend this movie to die hard Jet Li fans or collectors only."
5,Simple but stylish,"I loved the openning scene. It's quite stylish. The story is simple but effective.I saw a few compliant in here but as a Chinese I thought I'd give my 2 cents here. I feel that the movie evokes a deep emotion for me as how a classic hero would do in the most difficult times. When their country is surrounded by multiple external invasion forces and oppressed by it's own corrupted govenment, your fellow countrymen mostly cared for themselves and some are even preying on their own for profits, few are still willing to fight for a better future. The hero in this story is not just Wong but those two men who are willing to give up their lives to fight for their countrymen. Wong, again, caught up in the middle of uprising and must utilize his kung fu skill to battle for his beliefs and his love.I think this is the best of the entire series. If you are only to get one of the series, please get this one.rent it if you must but don't believe everything you read... this included of course."
2,Yaaaaawwwwwnnnnnn,Okay this movie is just plain boreing. This was the second jet li movie i had watched and was quite a dissapointment after Meltdown. The plot is old unoriginal and boreing. The fighting scenes are a total ripoff! jet li charges into millions of guys and with one swing of his hand they fly back a hundred million feet.The one and only reason I gave this a TWO stars is because of the wet rag (I'm a sucker for those)If you enjoy counting how many blades of grass are in your lawn try this movie if not stick with the defender or twin worriors.
3,poor video quality,"I am quite disappointed by the poor video quality of the DVD. It feels it is recorded off a VHS tape, far from DVD quality. This ruins the whole watching experience."
3,kinda disapointing,"this movie was ok, but it doesn't fit in well as a ouatic sequel. Rent before buyin it."
3,Ginnertronics,This is just like as if Greg Ginn did his slow strangly string bending guitar playing style & ran it through Robert Fripp's Frippertronics echo delays. Grueling but good if you can take it. Nobody but Ginn & his guitar.
4,Good,I bought this as a gift and they seem to really enjoy it. The product came with no damage and worked.
5,i am muy feliz !!!!,"This is great. Felicity all for me, and for us. Brilliant!!! Can someone tell us when the other seasons will be released????"
4,Felicity - Freshman Year,"I was always curious about this show but resisted watching it during its initial airing because I did not feel that I'd be able to relate to the characters. I just watched the last episode and can only say ""wow"" - the Felicity character and her experiences drew me in and caused me to reflect on my own freshman year experiences.Kerry Russell shines in the leading role and deservedly won many accolades for her portrayal of a young girl who alters her life to follow an unknown path all in the belief that she has a chance to build a relationship with her high school crush. The supporting actors, Scott Foley, Scott Speedman, Tangi Miller & Amy Jo Johnson were excellent foils for not only Felicity's experiences but their own trials & tribulations as university students.I'd recommend it for its intelligent & engaging storytelling, honest portrayals and exceptional acting."
3,Felicity a letdown (but at least I have it on DVD),"It has all the episodes, and for that I'm grateful. Thanks Disney. It goes down like, a notch, for changing the music. Almost every song that I remember from watching the series so long ago is gone. Goodbye Madonna, Heather Nova, Eagle Eye Cherry, etc. Yeah, I noticed it. With all the extra features and stuff that DVD sets have, this one is just disappointing. But hey, it's better than my VHS tapes, I guess."
4,"Good content, mediocre transfer","I like the show and the collection, but buyer beware! I'd recommend this since the price is great for around 20 episodes, but it's definitely sub-par for DVD quality. There aren't really any extras on the DVDs, and they force-feed you ads at the beginning. This could be forgiven since the adds are ""skipabble,"" but the transfer quality isn't. Scan lines are very noticeable, especially when the camera pans or there is a scene with a lot of motion. Don't get me wrong, it's watchable and isn't as annoying as fuzzy picture with a TV antenna or poor cable hook-up, but it's definitely not up to the potential of DVD."
3,Surprised by Felicity,"I ordered this entire series thinking it would be a good show to share with my teenage granddaughter. I agree with others that the cast is excellent and the directing was superb. My complaint is with the constant repetition of the theme of choosing the boyfriend who cheats, lies, and who always seems to do the wrong thing versus the one who is kind, smart, funny, understanding, compatable, etc. I was very disappointed in the content of this series and would caution others who have not seen the program to look carefully at the themes and messages portrayed."
5,I finally get to see the 1st season,"I got hooked on Felicity really late, the fourth season to be specific. And my boyfriend, who had been hooked since episode one, kept, I don't know, bragging? about how much better the first season was. I, having never seen it, was pretty annoyed at this (especially the implied ""I found out about this before you did, that makes me a more discerning tv-watcher"" thing). But, now that it's on DVD (and may they release the other seasons quickly), I can watch them all, commercial-free, in sequence. Whee!"
1,Every Season of the re-release DVDs are poor quality,"I ordered all 4 seasons of the re-release, and every season I received on the release date was defective. All the DVDs had major scratches on them. Poor quality DVDs ABC Studios, and I have had other DVDs that were produced by ABC Studios that were of the same quality, very poor. My suggestion is to not order any of the re-released seasons until ABC Studios gets their act together and put out defective free DVDs. I ended up returning all 4 seasons back to Amazon for a full refund on each season. And in one season there were 4 DVDs that were badly scratched. ABC Studios is not the only studio that puts out poor quality DVDs, CBS Paramount is notorious for this as well. It is about time that all studios have better quality control in place and not send out garbage DVDs"
2,i bought this for my gf,this transfers looked like it was recorded on a vhs and thentransfered on dvd picture is very blochy sound is horrible
3,"Great show, DVD misses the music","Honestly, I love Felicity, season one that is. You can imagine my excitement in finding it on DVD. While the episodes are there, the music is different. Maybe for those of you who don't remember the music from the episodes on TV it doesn't matter, but for me, the songs were important to the feeling. Why would they dub in different music for the DVD? That in itself is the reason for 3 stars."
5,Amazing show with great music,"""Felicity"" was one of those shows that I didn't start watching when it first came out, but I was always interested in it. I recently rented the first season on DVD and I'm so totally hooked. The first episode hooks you in, making you want to see how Felicity's life-changing decision will play out. The relationships between the characters are easy to identify with.My favorite aspect of the show is definitely the music. It is chosen very well for the different scenes, and every song has that ""Felicity"" sound to it. The greatest part is that none of it is ""Top 40"" stuff, it's got a different sound and really makes the show flow perfectly. Every aspect of the show is top quality. I'm looking forward to following the entire 4-year saga while it airs in syndication."
1,NOT BUYING THIS!!!!!,"Felicity Fans stabbed in the back again.I have not seen this DVD, but without the original sound track, why in the world would anybody buy this?Substituting other music for the original was undoubtedly cheaper and quicker, but the result is that I'M NOT BUYING THIS!!!!This is the same slap-dash approach as the final episode where ELENA is resurrected from the dead!! NO THANKS!!!!!"
1,"A show about dumb teens, bad music and horrible writing....","I would expect a show like this to come from Disney (who also gave us that Hanna Moron show).This series had incredibly bad writing, shallow performances, and an even worse cast of no talent hacks all playing the self-centered fools. I'm glad this show met with cancellation early."
5,Felicity Porter is 18 again...,"I loved 'Felicity' while it was on the air. I still catch late night reruns on 'WE: Women's Entertainment'. Even though I still get to see Jennifer Garner (Hannah) and Greg Grunberg (Sean) on ABC's 'ALIAS' (also a JJ Abrams creation ;-D), I still miss the cast of 'Felicity'.. especially Megan, Javier, Noel and Richard. This first-season collection is awesome. I hope seasons 2-4 will also be released on DVD/VHS in the future -- I know I'll buy 'em!!"
2,"5 Star episodes, 2 Star DVD Set.","I really love the show, but I had to rate it 2 stars, because the only ""bonus"" material they had was commentary. Menus are nice and touchy. I'm no expert at picture or sound, but picture looked a little granny at some points. My guess this is Buena Vista's first time for a dvd set for a tv show. I say to myself, if you really want to see a really great DVD set, it would have to be, Twin Peaks season 1, hands down. Even though it took long to come out, it was worth it! Let's just hope when Season 2 of Felicity comes out, they jam pack it with a lot of features, tv spots (Especially ""Cure for the lovelorn"", special b & w episode![.]), and the FELICITY clip spoofing X-Files, and ER (Which was featured at the emmys!) But most unlikely, it would just have the episodes again (ugh.)"
4,Felicity Follower Forever,"I must say I was DEVASTATED when I found out that Felicity was not coming back for a fifth season. I watched EVERY episode and the ones missed were videotaped by someone for my viewing pleasure later. I am still recovering from the shock of it all. Honestly. But my mourning got better once walking into Target and seeing Felicity-The Complete First Season on DVD...i almost wept. Honestly. Those reading this may think, ""she is a bit dramatic"", but those who know me know that Felicity was and will forever be my favorite show. I have just ordered the First Season and have pre-ordered (through www.Amazon.com the Complete Second Season --July 2003).Thanks to the studio for making this possible....i am forever indebted to you. *smiles*"
1,TOTALLY DECEIVING !,"I love Felicity, and I would love this DVD box set if only Buena did not change nearly ALL of the background popular music. So now when you pop in a disc, watch an episode, you feel completely and utterly lost as the beuatifull music originally aired has been replaced with new ""up to date"" music. Exactly like the re-runs on thw WE channel, same ""new"" unfitting music. This is not what I have come to watch and love.Would you buy the movie Ghost if the classic love scene would have another song playing in the background than Unchained Melody ? I'm sorry but changing the music alltogether is changing the overall feel and I don't get to watch the scene I remember the way they were done.Poor judgment from Buena Vista to think nobody would notice that.I'll stick to my VHS set thank you very much.This is sad. Don't buy this unless you don't care about the memorable scenes with carefully chosen fitting music playing in the background."
4,why CRM doesn't work,"Brilliant book, I recently purchased the book to help annalize why our CRM program doesn't work. The reasons are in the book time have changed so treat your customers accoriding to the changes. Our sales have increased since we have changee the mindset of the sales and marketing staff. I am currently on page 100, I can't wait too read the rest of the book."
3,"Ok, but.....","I liked this video ok. It gave me a real good workout, BUT the lady in the light blue shirt that kept yelling ""HEY"" was getting on my nerves. After 20 minutes I couldn't stand it anymore and changed to another work out tape. If you can get past the lady yelling out HEY every other minute this is a great DVD. I will try again in a few days. But right now just didn't like the extra noise."
4,Not the best video but still enjoy it.,"I own the Billy Blanks amped DVD's and I wanted something different to work out to, the workout is okay... the music is not all that great and the exercise crew goes a little too fast and off the beat of the music sometimes but I do feel like I get a good workout. It might be a little intense for first time users but I would still recommend it if you want a good cardio workout."
3,"Work it, work it, work it...","I wasn't very familiar with Billy Blanks but picked this up at WalMart on a whim. I find exercising like this and any kickboxing videos to really pull the stress out of you and this is no exception. As so many have mentioned, though, a little less repetitive motivational phrases would be appreciated. I can't say that it bothers me greatly; however, I do believe that the ""meditation"" segment at the end turns into a quick unnecessary autobiography that I doubt many are interested in (that's what Wikipedia is for)...so, I mute him and give myself a few minutes of glorious silence. All in all a nice 60 minute workout...I also use weighted gloves to give it a bit more intensity."
5,Great workout Video!,"Great workout Video! Billy Blanks and his team did a splendid job of producing this one. The music keeps you moving and engaged in the exercises. Unless you are in extreme shape, you should give yourself some time though to be able to work through the entire video. It's a great goal to shoot for..."
5,This is EXCELLENT; Billy does seem on the defensive though!,"I decided to do Taebo after doing Zumba for like 5 years and not seeing any changes in my body. I still do Zumba, but if you want to see your body slim down you need to do Taebo.I have done most of the Taebo workouts (thanks to youtube) and this one goes back to the basics. There are no gimicks just the basic moves that work. There are not too many reps like the AMPED advanced series and the moves are not so slow like a lot of the older workouts. This DVD is perfect. I do it at lunch in the office and I am literally sweating up a storm.The only problem I had with the workout is Billy being defensive at copycats. Blanks refused to let anyone use the name TAEBO and, as a result, missed out on a lot of financial opportunities. Apparently, upset that people are copying him anyway, he does seem to mention that a few times in the workout - thus the name, THIS IS TAEBO!"
4,I loved It,"I bought this DVD yesterday 09/18/2010 at Target along with Bob Harpers Lastest DVD.And i have to admit, the TAebo DVD gave me energy and it was an Awesome Workout.I will admit i thought the counting was going to get on my nerves,but it was actually not that bad.I really don't work out with Billy Blanks.I usually work out to Barry Boot Camp dvds.But i wanted to try something new.And i really liked it.Well today was the first day,hopefully i will ntice some changes at the end of the week."
4,Amazing. Sweaty. Successful.,"I absolutely love this DVD; although I regret not buying it on Amazon which is offered at a price much cheaper than where I bought it, I do not regret purchasing it! Billy Blanks is great-- motivating and successfully amps you up! :)When you first begin this fitness regime it WILL be very tiring; give it a week or so and you'll be okay. In the beginning your hips will HURT (""Turn your hips!"" Blanks consistently repeats) but then once again, your body will recover from it.I'm in love with this empowering workout and can't wait to get more Billy Blanks taebo DVDs!P.S. They really do work too! You start feeling stronger and more tone in about 1.5 weeks... for sure!"
4,Good Cardio,Overall a great cardio workout. But the counting (non-stop from start of the video to the end) was bordering on annoying and very distracting. When I can't get to the gym for Body Combat classes this is a great substitute. Only if they stopped counting and worked in better music.
4,Whatta workout!!!,"Very good workout. It takes a while to get used to the routine and follow along, but it's intense. I'm a year post ankle tendon repair, so I find it easier in bare feet!"
2,Average,"Not as good as his older VHS tape workouts in the late nineties. Simplistic moves, too much talking towards the end, and kind of a bore. I get an okay workout but it's not good compared to other workouts by Billy Blanks and wish I'd not bought it quite honestly."
4,somewhat difficult but quick results,"I used the ""first"" Taebo vidoes years ago..this is more difficult,a littlehard to follow at times.My one complaint is that there is too many steps involved at the same time. Example:Having a complicated leg/foot routineand also having a very involved upper exercise. It just takes a little gettingused to,I personally do the DVD half at a time.I have seen results quicklyso I would recommend this to someone wanting quick results. A full hour of this routine I personally think is to much."
4,More like 4.5 stars,"This is my new favorite Tae Bo workout. I have a handful of some of Billy's other DVDs (some bootcamp ones, the amped series, cardio inferno, SOS...) and this is my new favorite. He doesn't show off his moves while you march in place and he does pretty well on doing each side evenly (which he constantly does in others). But he does continue to always say ""one more time!"" when it's really 2 or 3 more times but I think that is just Billy. I really like how he jumps right into it and it is nonstop. This is a great cardio workout and definitely not for beginners. I feel so good during and after. I will agree with some others in saying that the cool down bothers me a bit. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. We go straight from a heart pounding, cardio move to slow tai chi then we have our palms together while he jabbers. I just turn it off there then do my own cool down and stretching. Other than some of these minor kinks, I really enjoyed this DVD and plan on using it frequently :)"
3,A bit disappointed,"This video is available in Target stores and I was soooo excited to purchase. I Tae Bo 6xs a week and have every single Tae Bo DVD. I would have to agree with the previous review....the counting in this video was extremely annoying. I think it was because it didn't flow well with the music. The moves are the same with a new background. I also missed Julianne, who is usually positioned on his right side. To me she was always a good example of form. Now there is an uncoordinated dude to the right, which looks awkward. Since I purchased it, I will use it but I'd suggest you pick up Get Celebrity Fit (Cardio & Sculpt) for a similar workout"
3,Not Challenge,"This DVD is not really challenging. Perhaps, it is good for new beginner. I better stick to originals Taebo Live videos."
3,Reality doesn't meet up to memories,"I have fond memories of his DVDs circa late 90s, but this DVD just didn't do it for me. The tempo felt too fast to make safe and controlled movements and that if I tried to keep up, I'd be risking injury. As a runner, I'd hate to be sidelined over a Tae Bo DVD. For these I stuck with a slower pace, but then that was a letdown because it meant less of a workout. I think no matter the weather conditions, I'd rather go for a run than pop in this DVD. Bummer!"
2,Mismanaged Elitist EU - No Fiscal Policy with Euro Debt Crisis,This book is obsolete. The 2008 financial meltdown thats made its way to the Eurozone has exposed the poorly implemented EU treaty lacking ANY fiscal policy that threatens the Eurozone and the integrity of the EU now. Germany runs the show and countries could exit the Euro to save themselves.
1,A Book only a bureaucrat could love.,"Book starts off interesting but focuses mostly on how the euro currency came to be, and etc, in minute details that isn't interpreted. Just a play by play of the bureacratic activity.I don't even know if I'm going to finish reading it."
2,Apparently France has all the answers...,"We often hear about the progress European countries have made in uniting their economic, legal, and political systems. A sober appraisal of these efforts would be useful. This book does not provide one.There is little discussion of the challenges confronting this audacious experiment, and ""Europe"" is too often represented as a monolithic and utopian entity. On the rare occasions in which the author deigns to mention criticisms, he frequently dismisses them with the sort of arguments that one feels the French have ready at all times. As it progresses, the book becomes increasingly breathless and fawning in its description of the EU. I found this tiresome and couldn't finish it."
2,A sham,"The recent upheavels over the European constition, the endless expansion into impoverishered third world nations and the notion of brining in non-european nations has destroyed the EU, making it weak and showing it to be the house of cards that it is. THis book is simply wrong, it is a nice idea that Europe has more people, more money and more culture, but in the end it is a failed confederation, sort of like the early american confederation. Europes 'single' foreign policy shows no teeeth and only finger wagging, Europe couldnt even prevent the rwandan genocide. THis is Europe, a house of cards, a paper tiger.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Yeah right!,"This book is good reading, but the premise reminds me of those who have been saying that the educational system in the United States is inferior to those in European countries. So called experts have been saying that for 50 years, but still every year the U.S. still manages to win 70% of the Nobel Prizes given. I've traveled extensively in Europe for the last 20 years and I love the countries there, but there is no way they are ever going to rival the spirit, creativity, hard work, and genius of the melting pot that is the USA."
5,Another winner by Logitech,"Being a multiple buyer of Logitech products, including other cordless keyboards/mice/steering wheels, purchasing the MX 3000 was an easy choice. I chose the 3000 because I am not a massive gamer but it gives me a good balance of features that covers both work and play. Good battery life for both keyboard and mouse, good array of enhanced keys and usuable buttons on the mouse. Highly recommend the system to anyone that is looking for a great cordless keyboard/mouse system!:)"
3,good keyboard but so-so mouse,"I have used this combo for more than a month. The keyboard works decently except that sometimes the reponse is very slow (few secs after I clicked the button), especially for the zoom in and out buttons. The mouse is not as good as mx 1000 laser mouse. It has some tracking issue when the speed is set to high. Overall, I would say it is a combo for light load users."
2,Keyboard flaky,"I have had this keyboard/mouse combo for a while now and I have loved it. Lately, though, the keyboard just starts acting up. By acting up, I mean it stops working. The function keys (E-Mail, Zoom, Windows key, etc.) along the side seem to work just fine, but the letter keys are unresponsive. I'm a software developer for a living, so this is just flat out unacceptable! It seems to work better when right click on the ""Medialife"" icon on the task bar and click ""Exit."" Don't know if that has anything to do with it or not."
1,Glitchy and eats batteries,"This cordless mouse and keyboard seemed like an awesome combo. The concept and ergonomics are great, but I've had problems with both the keyboard and mouse freezing up. I've also had nonsense characters pop up on the screen while using the keyboard, and the mouse eats batteries (about a set a month). To top things off, Logitech never honored my rebate request. Overall, this purchase was quite a disappointment."
1,Amazon lies,"Amazon says that it is in stock.Do not believe it.I ordered it at 8/26 and they could not even ship it at 10/1.They delayed it several times saying that it is in stock.Of course the website says that it is always ""IN STOCK""and can ship it now.Maybe their now is like 3 months...My current keyboard has broken keys, and I have serious inconvenience because of this."
2,Wireless feature only works very short range and causes the keyboard lag,"Well, this is the first time in many Amazon purchases that I've had to write a negative review. I'm also surprised I'm writing about a Logitech product - I've always been happy with them, including my last wireless USB laser mouse (which I plan on keeping now!)The keyboard lag and mouse lag are noticeable and I think the key may be in how close you are to the receiver. I was unable to get the unit to work at all over 8 feet away (distance from my big screen to the couch). I have to sit on the floor with the receiver pulled as far out of my entertainment center as it can go, so overall distance is now <5 feet and it seems to work most of the time. The closer the better.So if you are using this for getting rid of clutter on your computer desk its probably OK, but for my desired setup it isn't very convenient."
3,"OK value for the money, but MX600 mouse has cursor problem","I bought the MX3000 package of wireless keyboard & MX600 mouse. Seemed to work fine for a few months, but in the last couple of weeks the mouse cursor has started to jump to the right at random times. I am starting to suspect that this is something in the mouse as the cursor jumps some inches to the right horizontally, but vertically remains at the same level. I saw that other users have reported similar problems for other models of wireless logitech mice, so possibly this is something with the sensor used in the mouse."
4,Logitech Cordless MX-3000,Keyboard works great. Mouse is sometimes erratic. Setpoint corrupted and I had to do a complete reinstall. No problems so far.
4,MX3000 Cordless Keyboard & Mouse,"The Logitech MX3000 Cordless keyboard & mouse is basically a good product.My old cordless combination died... I won't go corded again... This is the replacement I saw on Amazon while searching through Google... And at a pretty good price and free shipping...I personally don't go for, nor need, the ""F-Keys"" and the ""Media-keys"". I do like the ""scroll and go back"" functions on the left hand side of the keyboard. The touch of the keys on the keyboard only takes a couple of days getting used to and it almost seems as if the keys are either smaller or closer together. I do like the physical characteristics and feel of the mouse. My husband likes the bigger, but not huge, multi-option mouse.In the future I will go to a store to physically look at and touch my next purchase. But, that in no way means this is a bad product. Again this is bascically a good product and is worthy of the rated 4 stars."
5,Mista S,"ok, so far i LOVE this combo. The keyboard is absloutly silent and the mouse is easy to use. Installation took about 3 minutes, just put in the batteries and connect the dock to the computer and you're set! Also, I was pleased to see this order come to me so fast, I got it w/free ship and it came in 2 days! xoxo this product!"
5,Great Mouse,Works great! Even from 15' away - don't ask why it's a long story... but we're very pleased with mouse performance... haven't really put the keyboard through much yet but it seems to function just as well as a corded logitech.
2,Not worth the price,"I had a wireless Logitech mouse and keyboard which I got from ebay. It was a refurbished item and I used it for 2 years. It was very simple but working great except the battery life. It broke recently so I bought this MX3000. I have been using it for 2 months now and I changed the batteries twice - and I only use it at home in the evenings and weekends. My second complaint is the reception of the keyboard. What is the definition of wireless? I can not sometimes get reception when the keyboard is on my lap and I am sitting on an angle to the table. It is crazy, why would I need that many buttons when I can not even get a decent reception? In my opinion most important things in wireless electronics are the battery life and reception - and MX3000 fails in both departments. My only positive comment is the mouse, it is very ergonomic and fits well in my hand. I do not know if there a better wireless combo but this is not even decent."
5,THE BEST CD OF THIS YEAR!!!,"En ViVo ChiChi Peralta, WOW I am very amazed by his music, this cd proves it all. The Music is top quality and the songs are fenomenal, this cd is a must buy for all of the people outthere.It was recored last September 2000 on the city of Santo Domingo and it is the best tropical cd of the year, and I'll guarantee you that Chichi will recieve another grammy for this work.So , if you are still having doubts about it, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, you need to buy this cd before they run of copies. So Don't think it twice, this cd is a MUST for all of the people outhere who enjoy good quality music like Chichi always gives us.BUY IT! I recommend it, I don't live on Grammy street just because I am beatifull."
3,Nice addition to your library,"I must admit that I shot myself in the foot by expecting this book to be another Princess Bride. This ""fable"" is definitely not the same. No high adventure here. But the book certainly has its merits. Goldman/Morgenstern is able to create characters with whom you instantly connect. You can't help but adore them--even in the case of John the Bastard, the overly-critical professor of hopeful gondoliers. The ending, overly sentimental for my taste, was a bit disappointing. Overall, the book was not an unpleasant read. When it was out of print, I would have said it wasn't worth the trouble of hunting down a copy. But since it's been re-released, I think it would be a shame not to check it out. It's a nice addition to any collection."
4,"Mr. Goldman, please write more!","While not as great as ""The Princess Bride,"" (seriously, that book is a satiric masterpiece that's hard to beat), this was a delightful read. Mr. Goldman manages to blend his satire with humor and poignancy, not to mention the crisp and clear writing. I would read anything written by him.Now please, please, PRETTY PLEASE publish ""Buttercup's Baby"" for your fans!!!"
4,punchy prose style,"Goldman writes this novella with the same irreverant style he used for ""The Princess Bride."" It's a cute little story about a man who loves to sing but is so horrible that the entire city of Venice pelts him with garbage.It flashes back and forth through the decades of the twentieth century and tells a cute little story but never quite achieves the grandeur of Goldman's other works.As a stand alone book it doesn't really hold up, it might have been better as an extra in yet another version of Bride. For my money I felt there should have been more."
4,FYI: Morgenstern is not a real guy,"Hey People,I am big fan of Goldman, but in reveiw after review you people seem to think Goldman really researched Morgenstern. Not So!!!!!! Morgenstern is a fictitious. Take a look at The Pricess Bride. The countries are Florin, and Guilder. Never have these countries existed. They are forms of currency. Looks like Goldman truly spins a great story, because you were fooled!! Read you History!!!!!!!!!!"
3,the morgenstern voice is irresistible,"I think this story is nothing special but the voice is amazing. I have a feeling that, whatever Goldman wrote in the Morgenstern vioice, I would read. The old man voice makes everything it describes sound cute, simple, and good."
1,Left out significant detail,"Although non-sealed or spillable batteries are supposed to be shipped dry, usually the battery acid is shipped along with the battery in a separate container. This battery was shipped dry (as expected) but the acid was not shipped at all. I have to buy the acid locally. Had the seller advertised as such, I could have made a more informed purchase decision and would have probably shopped elsewhere."
5,This CD totally kicks royal butt!,Lucerin Blue rocks. Every song is awesome! Its a shame not too make people know about them cause they are one of the best Christian rock bands out there. I totally recommend this CD. 6 out of 5 STARS!!!! Why are you reading this? Buy It NOW!!
3,If you're a Tooth & Nail type of guy then you'll probably like this a lot.,"There are elements of the Blue that I like (some aggro music and shared vocals) and elements that I don't (while not a lot of screamo a bit too much for my tastes). Still, some decent songs that are reminiscent of 1000 Foot Krutch and even Project 86. The songs are put together well and you'll probably find a few of them that stir your cerebellum up. But I will admit that in a market that is crammed with these types of bands they don't really stand out. 3.5 stars.Highlights are: the aggro ""Chorus of the Birds""; the loud but melodic ""Black Pyramid""."
5,"Bizarre, thoughtful, disturbing","It makes sense that the author of this book is also a biographer of sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, whose entire career was dedicated to the notion that reality is a house of cards, subject to fall apart at a touch. You already know the story: a guy enacts a 20 year deception, fooling his family, friends,and the world at large into thinking he's an accomplished globe-trotting specialist for the WHO. The strength of this book lies in the philosophical and psychological insights it achieves in exploring what it would be like to live in such a situation."
3,Compelling story - annoying author,"The story is amazing, and the book well written overall, were it not for the writer's egocentric style. He manages to slip his successes, his life, in short - himself - into to every few pages. Who cares if his screenplays almost always have been made into movies - I would have preferred to hear more psychological analysis of the case."
2,disappointing,"Read more like a newspaper article. Not very suspensful. Would have been better if the author had tried to get into the head of Romand, tried to understand his motives, but this reads like a 3rd person account and isn't very intruiging."
3,A HO HUM BOOK WITH A FASCINATING STORY,"...The story is fascinating as it describes an adult life that is led as a complete lie 24 hours a day for year after year after year. Sounds kinda impossible, doesn't it? It is true, however, you will have to plod through some ""plain vanilla"" writing to get the meat of the situation. For me, I have no luck reading a translated literary work. To my recollection I have not liked even one translated book well enough to give it a great rating....in fact most of them I quit before finishing. At least this was interesting enough to where I read from beginning to end."
2,Sympathy for a Monster,"I found this book to be horrifying in its concentration on feeling empathy for a man who killed his parents, his wife and his children. He robbed, cheated and lied his way through life and the author wants us to care about him? No attempt was made in this book to cause us to care about his victims. Even while he is in prison he cons his way but we are supposed to accept his behavior because he reads the bible and professes to love Jesus. I might have been able to enjoy the book if it were well written. I found the writing mundane and non-engrossing. If the author wanted to interest me in the main character he shoud have stayed with him instead of trying to make the author's connection with the conman a part of the story. I found no facts in the book that I had not already read in earlier newspaper accounts. If you must read it pick it up in a dustbin. I do not understand the praise it has received."
4,a brief review and a suggestion,"An incredibly swift read, The Adversary is well worth picking up. While it ultimately does not climb the heights (or rather, plumb the depths) that In Cold Blood did, The Adversary is almost as compelling, primarily due to its concern with exploring the author's own reasons for writing it. The book's strengths lie not only in Carrere's deft style, but in his frank examination of what it is that drew him to this story. More remarkable is how such a self-conscious approach can be handled in so unobtrusive a manner. A suggestion: before you read this, read Carrere's short novel Class Trip. For one thing, the Romand story was the true-life incident that inspired it. The Adversary includes many references to Class Trip (Romand turns out to be a fan of the book), and a familiarity with the book will prove most rewarding."
3,Interesting enough,"The book was interesting and the concept very frightening; however, I wish the author went deeper into the personalities of the characters. I would recommend to others for the conversations it might provoke."
3,"""The life of anybody"" in an spanish film.","""The Adversary"" or ""The life of anybody"" in film.\ This novel was taken to the screen to the Spanish language with a staff of very good actors. One is based on the full life of an impostor and the appearances that take some people. It excessively surprises the form to us in which the protagonist makes the decision from the outcome. Really, the written version is much more ample and it offers details us that do not appear in the film"
3,"Could've been much, much better","This is a fascinating true story and for that reason alone I found this book hard to put down. However, the writing style was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, the writer either didn't do much investigative journalism beyond his letter writing with the subject (plus his one prison visit) and some discussions with the subject's close friend. Since the subject is pathological liar and a sociopath, it makes much of the descriptions of events a bit suspect. The writer either didn't interview the police investigators or didn't care to include their thoughts for the book. I also felt that the author put himself in the story too much.Still, the story is so compelling that it'll keep you interested despite these flaws."
4,The classic text on the subject,"Michell is an extremely careful and conscientious chronicler of this difficult, dense subject. He writes unusually well - absolutely clear English - and makes his way through a wide array of topics. Invaluable to the student of the subject."
3,"Pleasing, Not as good as remembered","Still funny, but not as good as I remembered it. Good situations, Jack Lemmon turns in a fine performance, but more than a bit dated. Still a good film, and a classic."
1,Full Frontal Boring!,"All you have to know about Avanti: 1972. This is the old guard from the fifties trying to make a hip comedy about new sexual mores that looks less hip than the 1930's film, It happened One Night. Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon are of the forties and fifties sexual sensibilities. This creates unintended grimacing from the actual sixties and seventies crowd. ""Hey, grandpa, that's frontal nudity."" It's as embarrassing as spotting your parents in the shower. Juliet Mills, cute, nice chest, but not exactly a role your father and younger sister would be proud of.Also, the jokes fall flat then and today. It crawls to a pathetic conclusion."
5,My new favorite old movie!,"I admit it, I bought this movie because of Jack Lemmon and Juliet Mills (2 of my favorites), but I completely fell in love with it as I watched it. It's a sweet story without being syruppy. Lemmon and Mills give outstanding performances and Wilder provides us with great directing and scenery. The only possible reason this isn't a classic is the nude scenes, racey for the time (1972) but not by today's standards (no full frontal)."
1,AVANTI,"AVANTI with Jack Lemmon and Juliet Mills (bought and viewed in DVD) was a major disappointment. Biggest problem was the casting of Mills. Juliet Mills was an attractive woman, but her part needed a super-attractive starlet that could carry some rather dragging scenes with just personality and looks. The maid with the mustache was creepy, and having to view Jack Lemmon's bare-naked ass not once but twice was a bit much."
3,A must for Jack Lemmon fans!,An entertaining romp. Jack Lemmon is as enjoyable as ever. Beautiful Italian (presumably!) scenery and a sweet love story.
2,70's mistake,What went wrong with a Billy Wilder and Jack Lemmon movie? I think it was a 70's thing. This movie is dated and not funny. Funny is when you at least smile at the writing or gags- so unless you call Jack and Juliet Mills nude funny...... The running joke about lunch time is tired. The scenery is gorgeous though and it must have been a fun trip for the cast but I think Avanti is a product of the free love 70's.It's too bad the other reviews here lead you to believe it's better than Some Like It Hot because it really isn't.
4,Where's Gabe?,"I would recommend this author and this series to any mystery lover. I would have given this book 5 stars except for some changes that seemed to take place among the characters. While I enjoyed reading this book, I felt that it didn't mesh with some of the other books in the series. There was not as much interaction between the established characters in the series. I hope that future books in the series will return to the relationships we have come to know."
4,Eureka!,"I just discovered Earlene Fowler and Benni Harper! Wow! Seven Sisters was so good that I'm backtracking now to read all her previous books. Fowler's characters are so unique. Nadine, the waitress, has to be my favorite. Fowler is able to give descriptions that put you right there and make you feel you know or have met all her characters at one time or another. Good suspense. Unique twists in the story. I'm reading my second book now and look forward to knowing Benni Harper really well."
5,Canadian radio drama at its best!,"This production stars Lorne Greene, yes Pa Cartwright from Bonanza, and does he create a menacing Lord of the Undead. The changes CBC makes are minimal and for time constraints, but all in all, I'd say they captured the spirit of the book."
4,Benefits Outweight The Taste,"I think people are being a little too oversensitive about the taste. First off, it's really not bad at all. And secondly, you're getting a nice set of nutrients with this blend. I take a variety of supplements so I can't say exactly which supplement contributes to what but I can say in the context of my overall profile, I am deriving benefit from my nutrition. I take this powder with Maca powder and milk and I find the taste quite pleasant. Ever since adding a shake to my morning regimen I can definitely not a marked improvement in my overall energy. Even if it did taste bad (which it doesn't), I wouldn't mind because I do feel great throughout the morning."
4,Greens & Whey,"I read others review and disagree. This product tastes just fine for what it is; a health drink. I don't find any protein drinks that are made with really high quality ingredients to taste like dessert or do I expect them to. Greens& Whey really does provide the elements of health with zero bloat! Their is no other protein drink I have had that doesn't make me ( a male) feel pregnant-like and shy away from taking one in the morning before work. This product is highly recommended, even if you have to plug your nose - you won't have to feel like your going to fart all day like other drinks.A protein drinker of all brands for 30 years!Greens & Whey Protein Powder (Vanilla) - 23.1 oz - Powder"
1,Formula Change = Bad Taste,"I used to love this stuff. Unfortunately, the manufacturer made a small change to their formula, which I confirmed with an employee at the company. The result is not good. It tastes and smells rancid, like sour milk. If you have purchased this product in the past, the packaging is the same, so be aware that you may not get what you are expecting. Prior to the change, I would have given it 5 stars."
1,"Good ingredients, bad taste","Well the ingredients are fabulous. It's high protein, low sugar, and packed with green foods. Unfortunately, the taste makes it almost undrinkable. Perhaps if one used lots and lots of ice (to water it down), stevia to sweeten it, and perhaps threw in some berries or some other fruit to flavor it, it would be palatable. I won't be purchasing it again, especially when there are other similar products out there that taste good."
1,Horrific,"I was so excited to try this, but it totally ruined my otherwise perfectly good morning bowl of oatmeal. I had to force it down (fortunately I had just worked out for two hours, so I was hungry enough to eat most of it). It's slightly less repulsive when mixed with water, as I can gulp it down and then chase it with some real food. It had a pretty bad smell, a bad taste, and an even worse aftertaste. Please take the benefit of my bad experience and purchase another protein powder."
1,Haven't been able to finish it for years.,"My husband and I have been trying to get through this can over the last few years... me more than him, he's given up. I just tried it again this morning in a mango orange banana juice shake (mango covers everything it seems like) and it still had the terrible aftertaste but I was able to finish the shake (a first!). I know, it's chocolate flavor, this just illustrates how desparate I am to try anything, because I hate wasting it. I don't remember this from before, but it actually made my mouth numb. Maybe that's what they need to do to get you to finish it."
4,Pretty tasty,"I tried it. I found it was a little too sweet for me (it's sweetened with stevia, which I have never really liked the sort of ""tangy"" sweetness of), but other than that, not bad tasting at all. Blended with some soymilk it's just like a shake!"
1,A Workbook With No Answer Key ?,"I purchased this book in order to do a self-study of french to english translation. Though the book seems to have many good exercises, there is no answer key to the exercises in the book. I don't know how one is supposed to utilize the exercises if no answers are given. I emailed the publisher (The University Press in Lanham, MD) several times before they responded that they do not have an answer key on file. Thus I feel like the book was a real waste of money. Also, I read in another review that this book would be good for a translator of any language. I disagree, the focus of the book is french, and I think a non-french speaker will not find it very useful."
3,Sir Wilmer is more than a millionaire,This was a fair book. Definitely not Marian Babson's best. I like her books that feature cats much better. The story starts out slow. It gets better when Sir Wilmer arrives on the scene. I thought there could have been more detail about the birthday party. I especially like the relationship that the narrator makes with the solicitor. The spoiled older daughter was too spoiled for my taste. The ending did come as a surprise. It is a quick read and overall worth the couple hours it took to read it.
4,"Fine, unusual music sung w/ style & personality","I didn't know this music before, & I'm probably not alone in that. I'm glad to know it, and I won't be alone in that among those who get this fine disk. These are stylish and committed performances, which sell the personal and intimate qualities of the music. I've listened to the disk often, and have come to like it more and more.I'm looking forward to their next selections."
3,An Ok Debut......,"This debut release by UK's Pop Idol is a mixed bag. It starts off with the great ballad (also performed by Westlife) Evergreen and goes into a middle ground ballad ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE....from here it shifts into an anything but stellar rendition of The Doors LIGHT MY FIRE...it goes into another anything but stellar rendition of Paul McCartney's THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD.....basically the album is just a middle of the road effort....nothing stands out and makes it really deserving of the title POP IDOL......""From Now On"", I will be more cautious when purchasing cd's by Will Young! Gareth Gates debut album WHAT MY HEART WANTS TO SAY is a far better cd!!! Get it instead.....sorry=("
3,Better than Gareth's Effort,"This album is not really my thing, but it's better than Gareth Gates's effort. I used to like it, but I don't really listen to it much, but I did recently.Songs worth 1 star:NoneSongs worth 2 stars:""Lover Won't You Stay""""Love Struck""""Long And Winding Road""""Side By Side""""What's In Goodbye""""Fine Line""Songs worth 3 stars:""You And I""""Over You""Songs worth 4 stars:""Evergreen""""Anything Is Possible""Songs worth 5 stars:""Light My Fire""""Cruel To Be Kind""""From Now On""Worst Song: ""What's In Goodbye""Best Song: ""Light My Fire""Overall Verdict: 3.1 out of 5.0 starsThis album is okay, but if you'd like a better effort buy ""Friday's Child""."
4,Eighties Metal from Gals Who Could Actually Play,"Robin Zander, in the Cheap Trick song ""I Want You,"" sings: ""I'll search the world for a girl exactly you."" Maybe I'm taking my music too seriously, but why would he want a girl exactly like the one who doesn't want him? Yes, a broken heart hurts. But you can't be a wimp, either. That's why I like Vixen's point of view: ""I'll find someone else who's nothing like you."" Exactly! When your man or woman has done you wrong, replace him or her with someone new, different, and better. Vixen, four gals who could actually play, released a second album in 1990 and then disappeared from the mainstream, a victim of radio's move toward the new rock sounds coming out of Seattle. ""Edge of a Broken Heart"" was written by Richard Marx and the Tubes' Fee Waybill, an unlikely songwriting duo if ever there was one."
5,vixen greatest hit full throttle,their albums are the greatest and they need to be out so they can be gotten easier i always liked the music since the first time i heard it and now want to get it but its hard to find
2,Good idea. Poor execution.,"This seemed like a good way to try different salts to finish my cooked dishes. Unfortunately, the packaging is a problem: the smokiness of the 'smoked salt' that leaks through to the other compartments. Hence, you really end up getting six varieties of smoked salt. I e-mailed the company to suggest they fix the packaging. The said they would look into it."
2,Not for flavoring food.,"The salts are varied and interesting but the problem is that the grains are come out HUGE which means that while you can cook with the salts, you can't do what would be really fun - FLAVOR FOOD with them. Gnashing salt while you eat is not pleasant. Not recommended."
2,Confused a bit!,"The description of the types of salt was not what I ordered. I received a different selection than what was advertised. I should have been notified of the change, or at least a disclaimer indicating that what would be received may not be what was advertised. I have tasted all of the salts that were in the container, an frankly, I could not taste much of a difference. I am disappointed."
3,Not what I had hoped for.,"I would have liked to have known more about the salts than just their names. I also would have liked to have some of them finer ground. I'm at a loss as to what to do with salt that has huge grains. They make the food gritty.As for the salts themselves. I have had Himalayan Pink salt before, so no surprises there. A good salt. The smoked salt was as a good surprise. It goes really well with some things. I've had Sel De Guerande before, so no surprise there either. It's also a good salt. I haven't had Hawaiian Red salt before. It was a pleasant surprise. Pure ocean salt it no surprise either. Eurasian Black Salt isn't black. More like sand colored. It tasted awful."
5,The Standard,"I would say that for an all around high-end cable the Monster Rock Instrument Cables sets the standard. Tough, reliable and a life time, no hassle warranty. What more could you ask for?"
2,"Not a full workout, just shows the poses...","Perhaps I should have known from the title - ""Basics Step by Step,"" right? I figured this would be a complete workout, and I was wrong. This entire thing is just an instructional video to demonstrate the basic yoga poses. Disappointing in that regard. If you've never done yoga and you just want to understand how to properly align your body and understand the fundamentals than you will probably like this. If you are looking for a complete yoga workout (like I was) you will be disappointed."
5,This is Real Potent,Within just a few days of using this particular brand of ginseng. I noticed a huge jump in my energy level. Imperial elixir is one of my favorite brands of ginseng and this particular kind (Red Chinese) is extremely potent. I probably wouldn't risk trying out any other brand of ginseng because i already order from these guys and it works so well. I highly recommend them.
2,"Not bad, but not the best","I bought this product for its high potency, but quite honestly, it did not give me the energy I get when taking other types of asian ginseng. This claims to have 500mg per tablet and a serving sive is two tablets. So, for 1000mg I get less energy than I did if I took Nature Made's at 500mg. Now don't get me wrong. It does give you a ""little"" boost, but not much. Try Nature Made. Much better product for relatively the same price."
2,Beware!,"Fans of the classic comedy team will enjoy these episodes, however some very major problems exist: the audio and video are not synched together and the overall quality of them is very poor, public domain level. Listen or watch them, just not at the same time!"
5,Timeless and Healthy,One of the greatest comedy teams of all. Their comedic style is timeless and has been emulated by many of the TV sitcoms since their time. Recommended to all ages.
4,George Burns & Gracy Allen were quite the pair.,Love the old weekly series.. George and Gracy were quite the pair.. and just think George was good enough to play God
1,Too simplified...,"If you knew nothing about Colombia, I'm sure you found this documentary great. HOWEVER, if you know the very complicated political history in Colombia, you'll realize there are no ""good guys."" With the exception of American forces, every political organization in Colombia has committed horrible human rights violations! Liberals, Conservatives, FARC, ELN, EPL, and M-19 alike have committed atrocities this documentary can't even begin to address. Giving aid to Colombia helps Colombians. Giving aid to North Korea helps...no one. For a better understanding of Colombia, readWalking Ghosts: Murder and Guerrilla Politics in Colombiaby Steven Dudley. Many *firsthand* accounts from FARC, Communists, Liberal and Conservative politicos and Dudley's own experiences as a human rights observer in the Peace Brigades. It will OPEN YOUR EYES."
1,waste of money,"This machine lasted for about three months then just broke. I am so upset with myself for spending the money I did on this piece of junk! If you want an elliptical that you're actually going to use, then do not get this one."
4,Colonization with a twist,"This is a decent game. It plays well, and is somewhat addictive. You basically have to colonize a planet, using its resources to build the population AND armies, while keeping the peace. This is NOT as easy as it seems -- and many of us die-hard gamers like that. Diplomacy sometimes works, and sometimes backfires. Races have differing abilities, which add to gameplay. While most of the graphics are cool, some are game-boardish. Game play is limited to land regions, and you are able to customize the planet you wish to explore."
5,Perfect,"Perfect wind jacket for traveling! This was my favorite piece of gear on my thru hike of the Pacific Crest Trail this past year. I stuffed it into its own pocket and always had it accessible for when I stopped moving or if the temperature dropped. With this jacket, I hardly ever had to break out my fleece and I knew I could just throw it on and keep moving without overheating. When I was in towns, I always wore this because it looks nice. I used this almost every day for six months and it looks brand new. Highly recommend it!"
4,"Good Cans, But May Not Be For Everyone..","I really like these phones. I had a set of Grado Labs 125's that I sold to get these. The Grado's are crisper and cleaner, but the Sennheiser's are richer and more powerful at the bottom end (which is my own personal preference). If you're not real big on bass and low end, you may want to look somewhere else becuase these probably won't be your cup of tea. If you are a hardcore demanding audiophile you might find these too strong on bass and not balanced enough at the higher frequencies. If however, you just want some cans that can kick out some nice fat bass, give these a try."
2,"Might want to try before you buy (although with headphones, that's easier said than done)","First, the good: Sound quality. I'm no expert regarding headphones, but I had no issues with the sound on these.Now, the bad: I found these headphones to be extremely uncomfortable after moderate stretches of use. After 30-45 minutes, my ears would be in pain from being pinched under the pressure of the headset. And my head isn't particularly wide.Secondly, after less than three months, the connection has gone bad. They sit, useless, in a bin next to my computer. I didn't even use them that much before the wiring flaked out on me.Of course, most people seem quite satisfied with these headsets. Maybe you will be, too. But the comfort issues and flimsy connector can't allow me to recommend them from personal experience."
5,Not just for DJ's,"I bought these to listen to jazz - and think they are perfect. They do have heavy bass emphasis, but they aren't muddy at all. The bass boost really helps on those old jazz recordings where the bass tends to get lost. On the newer, higher quality recordings, I just turn the bass booster down or off on my portable CD player. The sound spectrum is very wide, crisp and clear. I listend to Miles' ""Kind of Blue"" last night, and heard things in there I'd never noticed before. These are also great at cutting out ambient noise - I can hear my tunes perfectly on the subway now. They are very confortable, I have a rather large head - they fit great. May be a little on the big side for some, but they fit in my commute bag nicely, and they really aren't that big when compared to other over-the-ear style headphones. I had tried other headphones in the $20 price range, and there's no comparison here. These are great!"
3,"Good Headphones.. The bass, not so Great !!","These headphones are really good with great sound quality, but before i bought it, i've read so many reviews about how powerful the bass is especially in house n electronic music... The bass isnt actually that powerful or that strong !!.. Its ok, but not as powerful as i expected.. The reviews give this headphone a 10/10... I'd give it a 7/10 overall...these headphones are really big.. deff not portable with a very long cable that u can wrap it around the headphone cups 4 times !!In general...If ur into bass and lookin for a pair of headphones with powerful n strong bass, i'd say go n look for something else. The bass is good but its neither great nor powerful !!"
2,"Good Sound Quality, but.......","I bought the original pair of these Sennheisers in 2006 and after 2 years or so the sound died on the left side of the earphones. I sent them back to Sennheiser for replacement, and to their credit, the exchange process was quick and smooth. They sent me a new pair of HD-212's and within a month of casual laptop listening use, the exact same problem occurred again. I'm not sure if its a product defect, or they are very sensitive to sweat/tears or something else.Needless to say, this is very disappointing as they are no longer under warranty and i have to now do another exchange or buy a new set of headphones.Sound quality on these phones is good--particularly on bass-driven music like rap and electronic. As others have pointed out, they tend to be very uncomfortable around the ears and look kind of goofy.Buyer Beware..."
3,Theyre alright but not great.,I bought these since i wanted more bass and clearer sound then the v modas i got for 20 bucks but i was disappointed when i found out these sound weaker. I read all the great reviews of the 201hds and 202s and thought these would be even better but they dont have the bass effect i like. I guess i have to spend more to get good quality cans the 280s are probably a sure bet.
1,Poor fit,"No matter how I adjusted these headphones they are tight, which wouldn't be so bad if the they went around the ear but they hit me on the ear.If you have a small head and ears, I guess these might be alright. Can stand to wear them long enough to find out."
5,Nice Comfortable Headphones,"The first time I saw those headphones, was in Virgin stores, they had them in all of their music cd player. I tried it for few minutes, to see how it feels, most import thing for me isn't the sound but how comfortable it is, as I use headphone while I am browsing on the net, which I do a lot everyday and for hours. I found the HD 212 pro is very comfortable even after using it for hours. The sound is also nice and clear and if you have good sound card in your computer, you will feel the difference, as I have Creative Xi-Fi card, which made a difference. The other thing that I like is the strength of the HD 212, it has fallen from me many, and nothing happened to it. I have it over a year and still working like the first day I bought it."
2,I liked them until the cable broke,"Good sound and comfort etc. However, the cables are pretty thin and flimsy, especially for a dj set. They are advertised as having replaceable cables, which is a plus, good luck however finding a replacement!"
3,Great Sound but Poor Materials,"I have been very pleased with the sound quality of the HD-212Pro headphones. The bass is as good as everyone says and the rest is quite clear, sharp and balanced... especially in this price range. The headset is comfortable to wear and I experienced minimal discomfort after 3 or more hours of use.However, after three years in my studio the foam around the ear cups and the foam pad that contacts the top of the head has decomposed. It has all melted and turned sticky and it comes off and sticks to skin, hair, glass, wood, metal, etc. It is difficult to clean off. These headphones ended up costing me about $20/year to use. I was hoping to get more use from them. I rate them 4.5-stars for sound quality but only 2-stars for quality of materials/value."
3,Great looking and otherwise adequate cable,"Frankly, I bought this cable because I thought the gold strain-relief ends would look great on my sunburst Strat with gold hardware. And it does. The cable is well-shielded and quiet. Unfortunately, the cable is somewhat stiffer than most instrument cables and tends to hold coils rather than hang limp. Unless you are looking to pimp an especially good-looking ax with gold hardware, you are probably better off with LiveWire Advantage or Fender Professional or any other decent limp and flexible cable."
2,Did Not Hold My Attention,"I like this author, the Hot Zone was a marvelous book and the fiction version was not that bad. These were the only two reasons I picked up this book. The description of the book sounded somewhat interesting, but without the author I would have passed on it. In hindsight that was a mistake. The author really did try his best to make a business case study more aptly used in a college class then a mass publication book, interesting to read. He could not pull it off. The good flow of the book and the fact that it at least tries to keep you interested is due to the skill of author. Yes there is a lot of detail about this new form of making sheets of steel, but unless you are in the industry or a gluten for punishment I would stay away from the book."
5,A change for a very Healthy Lifestyle,"A friend turned me on to Marilu's book and I have found that this is not a diet book,but a postive way to live a healthy lifestyle. As I have read some of the other reviews I noticed that people are saying Marilu's way is too time consuming and too much work. I think in today's society we want everything immediately and that is why a lot of people are unhealthy. Also anything worthwhile takes a certain amount of work.The neat thing about this book is that YOU TAKE WHAT APPLIES TO YOU!Marilu stresses that!She encourages you to cheat.Don't look at this book as a diet plan ,but a way of life. I found the organizational and spa tips great! Especially for being a ""new Mom"". I loved the Book and Plan!"
4,"At last, a diet that works!","I bought this book with much skepticism - how could I reasonably eliminate meat, dairy and sugar from my family's diet (I have four children under the age of eight)? However, my children found many of the recipes appealing and have even taken well to soy milk. I lost 14 pounds in the 30 days and feel great. I do not feel as if I ""starved"" myself. The intense shopping and food preparing was a little tough to get used to, but after a few weeks, the benefits of feeling and looking good were enough to motivate my family to continue. Recipes in the third and fourth week tend to be very tedious and more time consuming. I just replaced some of those with easier recipes from earlier weeks. Overall, great tips and tastey recipes!"
4,This is a blast!,"While I can't imagine doing this for the rest of my life, the past 12 days have been a truly unique experience. As a college student, the food is a little expensive and my roommates think I'm absolutely insane, but I am having the time of my life tasting new foods"
5,I really love this book!,"This book is just what I was looking for because of the menu plans that Marilu includes in this book. The menus really help you get off the red meat, sugar, and dairy! The motivation tips are really helpful. And the food is great! My only question is that I wish that Marilu went into further detail about why Rye sucks the fat out of you. Any ideas???"
5,Learn to Breath,"Thanks for clearing up my lungs. For years I tried to clear up the damage from smoking 3 packs a day. After I stopped dairy, my lungs cleared up and are at least 30% clearer after 2 months. My wife is nuts about the new way of eating and finds it a natural means of improving her overall health. Thanks again, Kevin"
2,Not if you dislike fish!,I got this book and was pretty enthusiastic about complying until realizing that most of the meals are fish! I hate fish! There's also some whacky reasoning as far as digestion goes. I think it would work not b/c of the diet but from the conviction required by the dieter.
2,Couldn't get passed first day,"I really wanted to do this diet, but after the first day of soup with rice and rye, I almost puked. I cannot even think of this trying this program again. I think that the concepts are good, especially proper food combining. But unless you like rye flakes in your rice, I would think twice. I liked the ideas outlined in her first book much more."
1,The only One who can deliver you is NOT Marilu!,"If you want a program that truly works from the inside out, buy The Weigh Down Diet or Rise Above by Gwen Shamblin. God can deliver you from diets and excess weight, not Marilu Henner. God designed our bodies and knows what we need. Give Him a try first. There are many things in Marilu's book that are incorrect and unhealthy. God did not make food so that we could be deprived."
3,Good recipes; very hard to find the foods included.,"This is a good book in many ways, but it is incredibly hard to find all the foods she includes in these recipes. I found that all I thought about was food, shopping for food, cooking the food, etc. I had to go to the 3 healthfood stores in our area (really good stores) and even people THERE had no idea what she was talking about. First time since I was a poor college student I went to bed hungry. BUT: there are many helpful tips. And, if you CAN find all the ingredients, some of the recipes are just great. She certainly has a positive attitude, which is inspiring, but she needed an INDEX for this book desparately and whoever advised her to include a full-page photo of her shoe closet was insane. Imelda Marcos, move over."
5,"Good advice, tasty dishes","I've done the 30-Health Makeover several times, mostly because I miss something along the way, or forget things over time. I first started this program in 1999, lost about 60 lbs. (without much exercise as I was working about 75-90 hrs. a week and my skin, hair and nails became healthier. I've always had people at work asking me what I'm eating because it looks and smells delicious. I sometimes substitute less expensive fish and the program works fine. By the end of the month, you're pretty used to the food combining and it's not hard to come up with simple meals of your own that follow the rules. Also, many maintstream grocery stores now have organic foods and lots of soy and/or rice substitutes, so shopping is easier than it was when I first started the program."
2,Too Rigid,"While this book contains numerous testimonials from satisfied customers, I found it far too rigid. By the time I reached Day 1 on page 83 and was confronted with no caffeine, no dairy, no sugar, no meat -- I felt defeated before I had even begun. No doubt there are numerous people willing to relinquish such mainstays in their diet and happily live on fish, tofu and soybeans -- it simply isn't for me."
4,Easy to use,"Although I am only on day three of the 30-day health plan, I feel good. This book makes it easy to change how you eat. I would never have ordered a veggie burrito without cheese or sour cream before yesterday, but have realized that I want to taste the FOOD, not the extras. I am not sure if I will go without dairy, meat or alcohol forever, but I am learning that I can use it in moderation in my daily diet. The best part about this book is that it makes it easy to eat healthy. My favorite is the shopping list at the beginning of each week. It has made me aware of foods that are sold that I did not even know exsisted."
2,I've never been so hungry in my life.,"Besides being incredibly expensive, I don't like this diet because I spend all my time cooking, cleaning up from cooking, shopping for food and a half hour after every meal, I'm thinking about food again. All I do is eat and prepare meals! I'm so hungry all the time. This can't be good for you. Everything listed as a meal goes right through you. I never feel satisfied. I don't enjoy food anymore. It's nice to spend time cooking but I am quite tired of it. It's a great diet for a very wealthy person who doesn't work for a living and has someone else cook, clean and shop for them. hey, that sounds like Marilu! what a coincidence! By the way, what is Arugula?"
2,"A diet mentality, too much work, much of the food is lousy","I had followed Marilu's first book Total Health Makeover, but was disappointed with this book. I tried the 30 Day plan and could only last 4 days on the menu plans. It was a very calorie restricted diet. The rice & rye and the soup were awful and I thought I was going to sprout gills from all the fish (normally I love fish, but not everyday!! - that's not even healthy). I didn't get into her tips that much - I got bored reading them. In her favor, I have tried some of the recipes (including some good fish ones) that I use occasionally (outside of the strict 30 day plan). I have no intention of following the actual 30 day plan again."
3,Marilu's REAL diet secret,"I have been following Ms. Henner's eating plan now for two weeks. My energy level is up, and my clothes fit better. I've eaten so much fish recently,I'm about to grow fins.The reason why Ms. Henner's diet works is simple. Once meat,sugar,and dairy are eliminated, there is very little in the way of fattening food left to eat. I think a better name for this diet would be the ""No Nothing Diet.""I have strong reservations about her notions of food combinations, and her statement ""Rye sucks the fat out of you"". If rye truly is the cause of weight loss, forget buying this book, and stock up on a bushel of rye!"
4,Inspiring,"I was looking for a change in my life because I just wasn't feeling great about myself. I wandered through the bookstore and stumbled on this motivation book. I'm on day 11 and truly feel better and have more energy. I haven't lost much weight yet, but I think it's just a matter of time before my metabolism wakes up again to shed those final 10 pounds. I look forward each day to see what's in store. Never before have I seen a complete 30 day healthy eating book.I do have to admit that's it's nearly impossible to do the lunch recipes because I don't have a personal chef that can whip up lunch for me. It's difficult stay motivated every day to cook both dinner and lunch for the next day all in one work night.It would be great if in her next book she would have a glossery for those who don't know what things like miso or Bragg's are.Overall, I'm really excited about this book."
2,Very disappointed in this impractical eating plan.,"I gave this plan my best shot but the recipes are too much trouble to fix. I was interested in her no dairy, no sugar, no meat philosophy and have been dairy and sugar free and have given up red meat. I do believe that has helped me. I can't afford to buy organic produce and I got tired of fixing the family something different every night. I will be selling this book as I have no need for it anymore. Anyone interested?"
2,Does not fit into the vegetarian way,"Although I liked the organization of the book with the types of tips included, I was very disappointed to see that Marilu included FISH recipes. Vegetarians do not just sustain from meat and poultry, but also fish. In the beginning of the book, she discusses how the human body was really designed for a vegetarian diet...why does she include fish as part of the menu? Furthermore, has there been any research done that food combining is really helpful? The ideas sound good--but where are the facts?"
1,So Extreme it caused my anemia and subsequent pneumonia.,"I read this book and her previous book, ""Total Health Makeover"", and followed it religiously for about 6 months. Just recently I came down with a horrible case of pneumonia and found out that I had been robbing my body of iron and b vitamins and had become anemic. The only way this diet can work healthfully is if you devote your life to it like she does and take numerous supplements. But that ends up driving you crazy. It's just too much deprivation."
2,I did not like the food receipes,"My son is diabetic., I found that there were too many pasta receipes. I know you don't have to use them but my diet would definitely be compromised with these receipes. I liked the tips the beauty tips and organizational tips."
3,"I like the guidelines, but this is too structured for me","Marilu's first ""Total Health Makeover"" book was a revelation to me, and I have changed my eating habits ever since. I stick to almost all of her steps, but not all. When this book came out, I ran out immediately and bought it, but found it a bit disappointing. Although I do enjoy her organizational and spa tips, I find the 30-day program to structured for me to follow. I do incorporate many of her guidelines into my daily life, but just can't stand to be so regimented, with daily recipes to follow, etc. I have lifted some of the recipes, but overall, I find her ""Healthy Life Kitchen"" book a more enjoyable read with better recipes. For those interested in the background and rationale behind Marilu's eating program, I recommend her first ""Total Health Makeover"" book, unless you are a diehard Marilu fan."
3,"Gets results, but a little fanatic","I am on day 27 of this diet (and yes, I do consider it a ""diet"") and it has been tough. I have lost 7 pounds, but other than that have not experienced the phenomenal changes Marilu predicts/promises. The menus got so repetitive (I may never eat fish again) that I started substituting almost all the time by week 3. There are some very good recipes, and in general I feel like I'll eat better from now on. But who wants to never eat cheese or real ice cream again? I believe in moderation, not deprivation! Overall, I'm glad I tried this, but it's certainly not something I would take up as a lifetime eating plan."
2,HIT ME is a miss,"I love Jim Thompson novels, and I love a good film noir, so I was doubly disappointed when I saw this movie. The direction, while technically proficient, sets the wrong tone, wavering uneasily between brutal violence and goofy antics. The annoying soundtrack was no help, as it seemed at times like it was intended for a light comedy. Elias Koteas' one-note performance portrays his character as if he was totally clueless, making him look as if he had just graduated from the Blue Lagoon School of Acting (Some day I'm going to count how many close-up shots there are of his dumbstruck face. There seemed to be quite a few.). When you find some of the supporting characters are more interesting, you know the movie is in trouble."
2,"Fun film, but a little too long.","I rented this movie cause it it had an interesting story. A bellhop in total mess. Its fun and chilling at times, but this movie is little longer then it should be. Elias Kortas is simply a great actor. He makes this movie. He is such a young Robert Dinero.This film was done in 1998, but just released on video/DVD cause it was done by the director who did ""Secretary."" This film I wouldn't put in ""Film Noir"" class like the back of box says, but I guess in the new genre of sorts: Post-Tarantino.This movie is perfect for a rental. Instead of picking the usual Hollywood BS, you should give this one a shot. William H. Macy has a very small role so be warned when you see him on the cover."
5,Works Fine !,I purchased the e805 dispite the bad reviews here and let me tell you mine works fine. I use it with navagation software and find it works way better than I expected.(travroute) E-mail works fine as does connecting to wireless internet services. I have had no problems with the screen. Not to mention I got lucky and paid $499.00 from COMPUSA. 2 THUMBS UP...Anyone interested in navagation software should give TRAVROUTE a try.
3,Could Have Been Better,"This book deserves a 3 and 1/2 star rating but since we can't do halfsies here I'll have to round down. The subject is more fascinating than this book reads. The author repeats himself way too many times and offers us a very limited perspective on the topic. Admittedtly that view, of the legitimacy of the representation of the Baltic peoples through their foreign legations, limits discussion, but the human dimension of an imprisoned people struggling for cultural survival deserves more than the dry legalese this book is written in.Since there is so little on this subject, for aficionados of esoteric cold war conflicts, this is almost a must-read. Hopefully someone will take up the mantle and write a volume on the people of the Baltic diaspora that helped these isolated legations maintain the embers of repressed nationalism."
1,Very disparaging...,"McHugh has done a disservice to the Baltic people and the United States diplomacy. He, in effect, besmirches the Stimson Doctrine which denied legitimacy to territorial acquisitions by power.McHughas work typifies the leftist attitude emanating from our academia."
4,Awesome for organization!,"Very pretty and is well made, just don't like that it's made in China. I don't use it as a coat rack, but to hang my daughter's dress up jewelry, capes, purses, etc. from. She can reach everything and it's visible."
4,easy to assemble and cute,"This is a very cute clothes stand. It's easy to assemble, which is important to me. The price is a little high, but it's the best clothes stand I've found."
2,Deceptive title for a preacher of MLM...,"BOY was I surprised to find that this book, which SHOULD have just presented SUBSTANCE on the topic, kept going back over and over again to the MLM company it was pushing. That TOTALLY weakened the book and made it much less credible. After a little while, I started to scan the book for the information I purchased it for, knowing I would PITCH it afterwards because of the heavy pushing of the MLM company.I hear that there is a new version of this book out. Hopefully it will be heavier on the pertinent data, and LESS on trying to sell me on a company's product."
2,"Close, but no cigar","This is not nearly as tightly written as Nelson's previous books. It had the feel of Julian Stockwin's new release,interesting, but doesn't stay on subject. The slave issues, although interesting are overdone. Precognition, a multi-tongued, slave selling other slaves is just over the top. Hope Nelson returns to his established telling of wonderful sea stories in his next effort."
5,It is a horror movie for younger kids and just as scary,That was so cool.The only reason I read the book was because of the movie.They are nothing alike all they used were the same names but the movie is a lot smarter and scarier.It is the story of a guy who has a lot of dummys in his attic but his newest one is brought back to life by his kid.She learned her leason because the dummy came to life and scaried the heck out of her and her brother and cousin.The coolest part was when slappy the dummy turned Zane the cousin into a dummy. It was the coolest ever buy it for sure.
3,Cheezy..but good for youngins,I watched this movie with my little sister. It scared her out of her mind..It is I suppose a good movie for younger kids..I wouldnt let your kids watch them if they are under 1st grade though. My sister is in 3rd and it still scared her.. END
4,Goosebumps - Night Of The Living Dummy,"Although I have not yet seen this episode on DVD - I remember when it used to be played on TV. (It still should be)It is a classic episode for kids - if you like a fun scare.- R.L Stine is one of the best writers ever. I wish he would release more titles to DVD (Cuckoo Clock Of Doom, Welcome To Camp Nightmare etc.)I really do miss watching it on TV.I hope it will also be released on DVD in Australia. My Pen Pal lives in Australia, and she loves GOOSEBUMPS too!"
3,Night of the Living Dummy III,"My Grand daughter LOVES this movie! It's one of those movies that the kids want to see over and over again. And for the adults the visiting cousin is non other than the young Anakin Skywalker, long before he turned to the Dark side!"
3,Better story than the last but...,"This does have a much better story than the last NOTLD but you can feel the story dragging itself in this one, much like it does with his Goosebumps Mummy series. Its not fun to read, which is a real surprise from stine (unless you read his new series, in which you shouldn't be surprised at all). I personally would suggest you get the first book and forget the others."
5,Night of the living Dummy 3,"Well, what can I say. I think this along with the Haunted Mask 2 and Welcome to Dead House were my favorite Goosebumps episodes. Now I am a little old for goosebumps, but my little brother says this is his favorite episode. It's just something about a dummy named slappy."
3,TWISTED AND CRUDE!,"This is the second episode about Slappy. It's kinda good and kinda crappy, but mostly so-so. Even though the acting sucks, the story is terrible and the ending's real corny and it dosen't show Slappy much, I still suggest it to anyone."
1,Not scary at all,"People think these goosebumps episodes are scary, but the truth is they are very boring ... Not just this one, all of them. I doubt this could even scare a five year old. All the other crazy people say this is the scariest movie, they are completly NUTS! I don't recomend this for anyone."
5,"Goosebumps,Please!",This is a real wonderful movie for kids and almost every kid wants to see a scary movie but to scared but this is a scary kids movie. Even some kids might like it because they love the books. The dummy Slappy is not a normal dummy. It walks at. It stalks your every move. It watches you DAY & NIGHT!
5,AWESOME!!!,"All of your movies are great!!! But I was on this website and saw that someone had put a 1 star on their review,and well i'm going to give him or her a 0 star. People just don't get it,those people need a doctor! In this episode Trina & dan's dad used to have a ventriloquist act,and now there are a bunch of ventriloquist dummies living up in the attic,and they ARE really LIVING!!!!!!! P.S. GOOSEBUMPS ROCK!!!"
5,ultimate baby shower gift!,"This is the ultimate baby shower gift or birthday gift for a pre-schooler! I have given this CD to over 10 friends who are either new moms and dads, or have preschool to early elementary-age children. All the moms, dads, and kids love the music and the parents love the lullabies and the fun songs!!! Robb Montgomery has a terrific way of expressing a father's love through music. Grandparents, you will really enjoy the song ""one"", a counting song that is very catchy and fun to sing with the wee ones. This makes a terrific gift!"
2,Very Pretty but doesn't hold up,"I must say, I got this ring and was thrilled with it. It was my ideal ring, it was gorgeous, I got tons of compliments, hell, in a round about way I got a job because of it!That being said, this ring does not hold up well. Shortly after getting it the seed pearls started to crumble and fall off. At this point there are only 2 1/2 holding on. Also two of the garnets fell out of the settings, and the back of the band broke. The band broke first, and I didn't think much of it; its happened before to me, but when the stones started falling out I was very upset.This is a gorgeous piece of jewelry, but if you love it wear it sparingly or it wont last. Mine sits in my jewelry box because it no longer looks good enough to wear with the missing stones (not to mention the empty settings are sharp)."
2,Really Pretty but Cheaply Made,"I bought this ring about a month ago and have worn it 4 or 5 times. It's really beautiful, but one of the tiny pearls has already fallen out. When I got it out of the box, I expected it to be heavier than it was. It's very light weight and apparently not very well made. I'm bummed because it is a pretty ring, but definitely not worth the price, as it's already damaged. I'd say it's worth about $20 max."
5,Great everyday Vietnamese cookbook,"I come from a Vietnamese family but was raised in a small Wisconsin town. Growing up, my mom would make Vietnamese dishes along with standard American fare. Although the supermarkets in the area did not have available all the necessary ingredients to make authentic Vietnamese dishes, my mom found comparable replacements. I never cooked that much to begin with, but when I got older and lived away from my folks, I wanted to try my hand at Vietnamese cooking and found this book while I was a student in Washington DC. I've tried many of the recipes in this cookbook and found them easy to follow and the results tasted quite good. Also, I thought it was especially helpful that the author used ingredients that could be found almost anywhere in the U.S. and explained or had pictures of what some of the ingredients were (I had never seen actual lemongrass until I moved to DC!). So, I recommend this book to anyone interested in trying out Vietnamese cooking."
5,Authentic Vietnamese food from your own kitchen,"I don't really describe myself as much of a cook. I generally can follow recipes, but I can't do it from taste or experimentation. Most recipes I follow come out okay, but I always wonder if it was something I did wrong or if there was a secret ingredient left out, because they only turn out so-so and lack that punch. Not this cookbook.Some things to point out:* The photos are beautiful. Not all recipes have a photo to accompany them, though. Wish they did.* The recipes are easy to follow, but if four-ingredient cooking is your thing, you will not find it here.* Each recipe comes with serving suggestions.* Every recipe I've tried has been a hit. No misses. A perfect blend of flavors.For an authentic taste of Vietnam, try this cookbook. Every recipe is sure to please."
3,Sweet Sickness by Patricia Highsmith,"The book is in fairly good condition considering its age. Upon reading it I find it's not as compelling as some of Highsmith's other books. Another reviewer had recommended it, and as personal opinions go, sometimes another's is not quite as expected. That is what happened with this purchase. Thanks.Additionally, I would suggest ""Those Who Walk Away,"" by Patricia Highsmith, just as suspenseful as the Ripliad. And on a farther note, ""The Price of Salt,"" which came out about the same time as ""Strangers on a Train."" ""Walk Away"" has the extra fillip of being set in Venice, and since Highsmith spent considerable time in Europe, she knows Venice well: the action moves along clippety-clop among the Venetian quays, islands, and sections, not distracting, but illuminating events and even characters."
2,Dull Camp,"By far the weakest Highsmith effort. Tedious to the point of eyestrain, with a prose ""style"" that waffles between cliche and camp. I was dis-dis-disappointed. Glacial pace. The book is redeemed by its final forty pages--the very end is quite moving, actually. But how many times can we read (paraphrase):__Wes clapped David on the shoulder. ""Have a drink, Dave, and forget about that girl for a while."" David felt a rush of anger spread to his cheeks. Forget about Annabelle? He had her name tattooed on his ass! He looked again at Wes's pleading eyes, then again at Effie's maudlin, pitiful face. A rush of anger welled within him and spread to his nose. He would leave the house at once! He needed socks, knit socks, more of Mrs. Beecham's knit socks. He ordered two martinis and retired to his room to masturbate furiously over Annabelle's 50th non-existent letter.__"
2,What!?,"This does not look like the picture. Buyer Beware! I have had the $10 plant for 3 months. Not worth the money. It was half dead when I got it, and the company said I could pay to return it to them, and would have to have it packaged in a certain way. Cost more to ship back. I kept it and I am still not happy. I bought a few plant from them. I have a green thumb and love house plants, but these were not worth it."
4,GOOD MOVIE OR NOT????,"This review will be short... the movie was good but it is exactly like the original movie MANHUNTER just with new actors and Anthony Hopkins playing Dr. Lectar!!! So if you liked MANHUNTER you will like Red Dragon, if you didn't like MANHUNTER , you won't like Red Dragon."
1,Weakest Dragon,"Please stop the hype! This film is a bomb. It stinks. Edward (Hero of the Chin-less) Norton's mannerisms resemble those of the feeble post-altheimers Ronald Reagan and not those of an F.B.I. agent. How can writers give Norton a line like ""put a cap in your ass"" and allow him to have that mousy mug under poorly dyed blond hair. Please! Silence of the Lambs set the bar way to high for these filmmakers. Like the audience who went out to see this junk, they should have stayed home."
5,Red Dragon,Another fine example of Hannible the Cannible. Nice suspensful pace that keeps you rivited.
1,The only scary one in the series...,"Oh this is so scary. Also recomended is The little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Timmy the Tooth."
3,"Not quite ""Silence,"" but better than ""Hannibal""","This movie was good, and entertaining to watch, but there were some silly things in it. It was fun to see Hannibal Lecter as a caged psychopath again, and Edward Norton was fantastic. The man who portrayed the Red Dragon though, (Ralph Fiennes) did a good job, but his character was kindof silly. He was an annoying villian, and not much fun to watch. He was amazing in Schindler's List, but the scenes with him in this kindof dragged. Nonetheless it was a good movie, it just lacked the amazement to it that Silence of the Lambs had, and it surely isn't headed to the Academy Awards. It was better than Hannibal though. The R rating is due to very little (as well as un-neccesary) profanity, some non-sexual nudity, and violence."
4,Tastey,"I went into this film with little to no expectations for this film. With Ridley Scott's Hannibal being such a let down I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of the guy who directed Rush Hour tackling something as Hannibal Lecter.I had the fortunate opportunity seeing this film the Wednesday before it came out at my college and found myself very satisfied with the film. It isn't as great as Silence of The Lambs, but Red Dragon on its own has some real standing power. Once again Anthony Hopkins was able to make my skin crawl and Edward Norton's protrayl of Will Graham was absolutley fantastic."
2,Red Dragon (An old book with a new cover),"For those of you who think that this movie is an improvement over Hannibal, I agree that is slightly better. You have been duped, however. You should be comparing this to the movie Manhunter (1986) with William Peterson. Red Dragon is an attempted remake of an excellent movie with very little extra to offer accept an average performance from Anthony Hopkins. I urge you to watch Manhunter first, as it was made long ago, and you will see Red Dragon for what it really is. Considering whether this is a different adapatation as written by others, I recall much of the same dialogue from Manhunter and scenes straight out of Silence of the Lambs. One can only deduce this was made as a money maker first, and entertainment second."
4,Red Dragon,WHAT IS IT about serial killers that fascinate us? I love Anthony Hopkins. Gotta love the Lector.Gave this one as an Xmas gift
5,Best Movie Plot In A Long Time,"Man! I just saw Red Dragon and it was hot! Anthony Hopkins was, of course, brilliant as always playing the manipulative doctor. Somehow, you find yourself rooting for Lectar. The star killer of the movie, know as the ""Tooth Fairy"", comes close to rivaling Hannible in insanity, though. Action packed, dark, and at some times even touching, this movie rocks, and even Sherlock Holmes couldn't have got the ending. Don't tell it to anyone who hasn't seen the movie. Can't wait for the DVD! ^_^"
2,"Ok, but no Manhunter....","Red Dragon was a decent movie by itself, though it relied on the prestige of SOTL too much. It starts off adding an extra scene to include Anthony Hopkins, and continues this habit throughout the movie. These scenes are not in the book and do nothing to further the movie. Red Dragon has an all-star cast, though no one seems to put effort into their role. Most importantly, Edward Norton (playing Will Graham) fails to portray the innner conflict in Graham. He seems unaffected by the case, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Manhunter was a much better movie, with much better directing and acting. In Manhunter, William Peterson plays Graham and does the part much better. Peterson plays a dark, brooding investigator who is truly sacrificing a part of himself to take on the case. This self-sacrifice is the heart of the book, and was largely lost in Red Dragon. I recommend that anyone interested in Red Dragon watch Manhunter instead."
2,"Maybe is not that bad, but after seen ""Manhunter""...","I think they did a poor casting for this movie. Edward Norton is a great actor, but this part (Graham) just doesn't fit him at all. Also, Ralph Fiennes, good looking guy, playing Francis Dolarhyde??? It doesn't make sense.Michael Mann (director of Manhunter) is a genious, the way he goes deep on each character and the music (check Miami Vice), the perfect song for each scene, man! it's everything this one lacks of.Compare Manhunter with Red Dragon, compare the scene of Francis and Reba at the vet, with the tiger, with whichever scene of Red Dragon. You'll see."
2,Stale white bread in slick packaging,"An extraordinary cast and top-notch production values can't redeem this exercise in rehashed mediocrity. Watson, Fiennes, Norton, Hoffman, Hopkins, & Keitel--rarely has so much A-list star-power been gathered together to so little effect. We have seen it all far too many times before, and both SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and the B-grade MANHUNTER did it much better. No matter how slick the packaging, there's still a loaf of stale white bread inside. Even a gourmet like Lector would be hard-pressed to concoct an interesting dish from such bland ingredients."
3,Manhunter.,"The HOPKINS/LECTOR shtick is getting old. Almost identical in content to 1986's MANHUNTER save the very beginning and Hollywood cookie cutter ending, RED DRAGON is merely there. Manhunter was the better film and BRIAN COX deserves more credit for basically inventing the LECTOR character for film by paving the way for HOPKINS tour de force in LAMBS. Although both performances excellent, it was nice to see two different takes on the same psycho. The canibal has now pretty much been turned into a mockery of himself and the 'franchise' needs to take the vacation DR. CHILTON did."
1,Not Happy,I only chose this rating because the company it came from sent me the wrong movie. and even that was scratched and wouldnt work.
4,Meet Dr. Lecter for the 2nd time!!!,"In case you don't get my review title, I'm counting Hannibal Rising as the very first movie. Red Dragon is a really good prequel to The Silence of the Lambs. It shows how Hannibal got in that room and how he helps Will Graham find The Tooth Fairy. The Tooth Fairy is a psychopath who is obsessed a painting called Red Dragon, and had an abusive grandmother. The Doctor is in, and I highly recommend RED DRAGON!!!"
3,Not too keen on this one,"Perhaps it was me comparing this movie with it's earlier version, 'Manhunter', but I just didn't buy the acting. Edward Norton is a fantastic actor, but after seeing William Petersen in the role of Will Graham, Ed just didn't make me believe it. 'Red Dragon' does follow the book closer, but rarely will you find a movie that does justice to the print that inspires it. I believe 'Silence' to be a better film and 'Hannibal' just plain sucked. If you're a Hopkins fan as I am, 'Hannibal' probably left you with a bad taste in your mouth; however, this one does go a long way in redeeming the Hannibal character.PS. Tom Noonan IS the Tooth Fairy! Sorry Ralph."
3,Wait for the Video,"As usual the previews make it look much more exciting than it is. If this would have been released first, it might have been more thrilling, but we've already seen Silence, and you can't top that. This movie was not suspenseful or scary. It was like watching Law and Order or one of those other crime investigation shows, except on the big screen with a little more drama. People were laughing at Hannibal, I think he just looked too old. My husband kept nodding off, I had to poke him in the ribs to keep him from snoring.All in all, it's not a horrible film. I found it entertaining and I love the cast, but I would recommend waiting for video."
5,Very awesome movie,Its better than manhunt the original of this movie I think it picks up parts that were left out in the original even thou its diffrent actors it is the same stoyline but i like the way this one plays out it has more action in it.
5,Excellent Adaptation to a first class book.,"Red Dragon is what Manhunter should have been. This is a taunt, unnerving piece of filmmaking that really ranks right next to Silence of The Lambs as one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. Edward Norton is great as Will Graham and Ralph Fieness is amazing as Frances Dolarhyde and their performances alone are worth the praise alone, but it's Anthony Hopkins's third go around as Hannibal Lector that makes this film the crowd pleasers that it is. Hopkins gives a more unnerving performance than he gave with ether Silence or Hannibal that is laced with enough black humor that makes him almost disturbing to watch. This film really shows how sinister Hannibal can truly be, especially when he wants vengeance. This is a first class adaptation in the highest order, and I hope this is not the last we see of the good doctor."
1,red dragon,I wasted money on this movie. It is formatted in HD DVD and won't play on anything but an HD DVD player. The format is now obsolete so I guess I'll have to re-order in regular DVD format.
4,LIGHT YEARS BETTER THAN HANNIBAL,"Very good movie, 99% similar to the book. Anthony Hopkins as excellent as always. Just a few observations : Why Scott Glen didn't appear as Crawford ?, Graham's Wife acting (even as a supporting actress) was very, very bad. The music didn't help much compared to the Silent of The Lambs music. Even though Ralph Fiennes did great as Dolarhyde, casting director should have considered Gary Oldman, don't you think ?. Ed Norton was a little bit under his normal high quality acting."
3,Entertaining,"Michael Mann purists may turn their qualified noses up at this offering, and there is, granted, much which can be faulted. Contrary to fringe belief, there is also a lot which can be faulted with 'Manhunter'. I do not need to expound tiresomely on these views; they sre to be found in abundance at various sites, including this one. Detractors are eternal. Flawed but entertaining."
2,"Lame remake, but not as bad as Hannibal","This movie has greed written all over it. With there already being a very good version of Harris's book made in 1986 (Michael Mann's Manhunter), the only reason to make this is to capitalize on the ""sucess"" of Hannibal.It's not that Red Dragon is THAT bad of a movie. It's serviceable, with a cool action-y ending. But the phenomenal cast is utterly wasted. Norton looks brain dead, and Hopkins is so hammy it looks like there should be a green egg on either side of the screen.If you like very basic thrillers, you might like this movie. If you have any sense for artistic merit, forget it. You'll be bored out of your skull. Oops, bad metaphor."
4,"Another review... Goody, goody","Red Dragon should be remembered in the Hannibal Lector series for being the one of the three most accurately translated from novel to theaters. Aside from following the book well, it is still a decent movie! Whereas the novel is a very tedious read due to its overtechnical attempt at clocking the forensics of a crime scene, The movie manages to capture an amazing story. The way this movie was filmed gives it an increadibly nightmarish feel. It moves fast in all the right ways, touching briefly on the forensics and delving in depth into the mind games and plots of his horror genre majesty Hannibal Lector. For a blast from the past you may also want to examine ""Manhunter"" the origional version of this movie featuring a great actor: Brian Cox (Supertroopers, LIE...) in the role of Hannibal."
1,The Horror.....The Horror,"Attention Hollywood. Stop remaking movies that are already good i.e. Psycho(1998) and Red Dragon(2002) formerly known as Manhunter. This movie was slow and boring. Ralph Fiennes failed miserably measuring up to Tom Noonan's performance as Francis Dolarhyde and in this go around Anthony Hopkins is outperformed by Brian Cox's previous portrayal of Hannibal. The film had no sense of urgency or suspense like Manhunter had. The cast even ""acted"" like they had a case of deja vu (hasen't this story been told once before?) Granted having seen Manhunter I knew what the story was so there were no real surprises. but at least give it the college try for entertainment. It even failed there. Avoid this movie at all costs. If I could give this movie zero stars I would. Do yourself a favor and watch Manhunter."
4,Creepy!,"See this movie. After reading the luke warm New York Times review, I was skeptical, but being a fan of horror-mystery, I couldn't stay away from this film, and I was NOT disapointed. The entire acting cast gave great performances. Creepy as the movie is, there are even bits of humor along the way. Hopkins, who is marginal in this film, is great, but that's to be expected. He is the one monster/ bad guy eveyone loves. Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary. He is creepy, diabolical, giving, sensitve, and childlike all at the same time. He's amazing. Emily Watson puts on a good show as well. You will love this movie, I promise."
3,"Once again hopkins, the wooden prince of acting manages to w",despit fine efforts by cast members Hopkins pachydermizes a decent script into a slogging trek through genre violence.. in much the same manner in whic he trivialised Legends of the Fall against the efforts of Aiden Quinn and other stellar cast membersThis film should spell the end of the good Doctor Anthropophagis we trust
5,"Opens the door for ""Silence"" and shuts it on ""Hannibal""","I though Hannibal was a good movie. But it definitely doesn't compare to this gem! Before the movie came on, my stomach was completely empty and all I could think about was food. But the minute the movie came on, my previous thoughts faded and I never left my chair for a second. That's the effect a movie like Red Dragon had on me. Edward Norton was a wonderful pick for this movie. His chemistry with Hopkins easily rivaled Foster's. Ralph Fiennes in my opinion though was the show stealer. His acting was so convincing that you could almost feel sorry for him and what he was which was a killer ruled by pain and suffering. For people who thought that the series went downhill after ""Hannibal"", do yourself a favor and see Red Dragon. Like I said, I liked Hannibal, but Red Dragon shuts the door on it."
5,Another masterpiece from Thomas Harris's Mind,"Anthony Hopkins yet again does not disappoint. Edward Norton and the guy who plays the Red Dragon also have strong performances. Red Dragon was the first of the Lecter series by Thomas Harris and considered by me to be bested only by the Hannibal novel, not movie. Great one for the collection"
3,'Manhunter' ruined this film for me.,"Red Dragon is actually a remake of the 80's Michael Mann version of this story. So I had the characters already set as to my expectations, and Manhunter did a beautiful job with the story to begin with. I'm sure that is what hurt this film for me. It certainly wasn't the casting or the story. This version was a little more 'splashy' than the gritty nature of Manhunter, and the grit I think helped the original movie more than this did.Fiennes was a surprising Dollarhyde. He is truly one of the most gifted screen actors we have. Hopkins is too identified with Lector to not like him, even though his part is scant. Even Norton, who can't seem to fail at a part, gives Will Graham a vulnerability much different than William Peterson's original.I think the casting gives you most of an expecation for a 'bigger' film, which this story can't be. I just felt that the casting and manner the story was told in Manhunter 'fit' better than this one."
3,better than Manhunter,"It was a badly needed update, but I just hate knowing the end. That feeling resonated throughout the whole thing. Other people seem to really like it, so maybe it's just me. I thought it was a little dull. Your going to see it anyway, so just lower those expects and it'll be groovy."
2,ManHunter was Better!,"Although Red Dragon is closer to the storyline of the book, it did not have the haunting eerieness of Manhunter. The only thing Red Dragon had going for it was Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector. Edward Norton played Will Graham in Red Dragon and I have to say he was not very convincing. It was orginally played by William Petersen of the series CSI and he was much more believeable and tangent as the FBI investigator. Edward Norton seemed way out of his element. I'm not saying that Red Dragon is a bad movie.....it's just not as good or as creepy as Manhunter."
3,Not bad,"This is a little better than I expected. It may be closer to the book (which I have not read) but its not as good as Manhunter, and its a big drop in quality from the under-rated Hannibal and it certainly doesn't stand up to any comparison with Silence of the Lambs. However, the cast are good and there are some chilling moments, but good as the cast are, Ralph Fiennes is just not scary compared with Tom Noonans performance in Manhunter.My advice if you want to buy one version of the Red Dragon story is to buy Manhunter. If you really must see this version, rent both this and Manhunter and only then if you prefer Red Dragon buy it."
5,much better than manhunter,"i watched manhunter on recommendation of a few friends and was bored. the characterizations in that movie were flat and cold. but with red dragon, everything's changed. this is the first time that i've seen a remake that's better than the original. edward norton as will graham added so much more depth to the character. and the beginning shots, where they established the relationship between lecter and graham was perfect. i also really enjoyed ralph fiennes' portrayal of dolarhyde. in the first one, the killer was large, ugly and looked monstrous. with this one, fiennes' defect was more subtle, and was monstrous only to him. also, the establishment of a cruelty-filled childhood gave the killer a more sympathetic side. all in all a great movie."
4,"Suspense, not horror","This latest release continues the tale of Dr. Hannibal Lecter through a vicarious interaction with an obsessive killer. The movie captures the past and present day life of Hannibal while providing the viewer, atleast those who have not read the books, with some of the background on how he was caught.The movie maintains the suspense of the original, though certainly not as chilling as the Silence of the Lambs. A very solid rental. With the exception of the advid fan, most movie buyers should pass on this and save thier money. ..."
5,Great! Very enjoyable thriller!,"Everyone was wonderful in this movie! We rented it not really knowing what to expect after having seen Silence of The Lambs and Hannibal. This movie was a real murder mystery thriller with fantastic performances by everyone. I thought it was well-cast. Ed is perhaps better-known for playing the bad guy, but he pulls off this role and manages to make us believe he is fearful. I personally believe Norton deserved an Oscar for his performances twice before."
2,"Can't replace ""Manhunter""","I'm pleased to see that other reviewers have had the same impression I had. Red Dragon is just a remake of Manhunter, and not nearly as good. All the performances in Manhunter are much more intense and edgy. CSI's William Peterson is a better Graham, Tom Noonan a MUCH better Dolarhyde, and Brian Cox will always be THE Hannibal for me. My two stars are for Harvey Keitel, always an interesting actor, even if his character wasn't."
5,Awesome thriller!,"If you liked ""Silence of the Lambs,"" this is a must see! Hannibal was a bit too graphic for my taste, so this movie brought back the class that was originally found in ""Lambs."" Anthony Hopkins portrays Lector with genius and sophistication, and Edward Norton should be noted for his excellent performance as well. Great movie!"
2,Not the REAL Red Dragon,"A remake of ""Manhunter."" William Petersen (CSI recent), Brian Cox, Michael Mann's pre-Miami Vice version of ""Red Dragon"" is head and shoulders above the Hopkins version. Go toManhunter (Director's Cut, Limited Edition Set)for the original.The linked version of Manhunter includes both versions, the key difference being the ending many saw when the movie was released, then wondered what happened to when they saw the movie on for-charge TV broadcasts."
4,Near Greatness,While this movie is not the best of the series it is good. Its near greatness. I would say if you have yet to see the others (get out from under your rock) this would be a great movie. The acting is top notch and the HDDVD transfer is great. So nice.
2,Red Dragon too predictible,"Even though I liked the movie,it held on to too manyof the same preceptions,created and used,in The Sil-ence of the Lambs.The suspended fear was no longerthere.It's almost as if we have gotten use to the""good"" doctor.I fear that Hannibal Lecter's intensitywas the only thing holding the film together.The lastpart was so predictible,I was tempted to be angry withthe director.As Doctor Lecter would Say,""Please don'tinsult my intelligence!"
2,"Not believeable, scary, or funny","First of all, shame on these guys for tricking us on the DVD. You push ""Play Movie"" on the menu, and instead of playing the movie as promised, they make you watch a preview for The Incredible Hulk. Extremely annoying.The only worthwhile moments in the film are with Anthony Hopkins, but he is not central to the film. The problem is that the tortured (and torturing) serial killer, played by Ralph Fiennes, is just plain weird. Not interesting, not compelling, and above all, not believeable.There are some unintentionally funny scenes where he talks to his mom that could have been lifted straight out of Psycho. Except at least Psycho knew that it was a campy exercise in style, whereas this movie takes itself way too seriously."
3,"Better than Hannibal, Rehash of SotL","This movie was definitely better than ""Hannibal"" (H). Many of the scenes and mannerisms were very similar to ""Silence of the Lambs"" (SotL), sometimes annoyingly similar.The acting was good, but I was disappointed with Edward Norton. This is primarily because I have seen his excellent acting in other films and it seems that he was strait-jacketed in this one. The limitations are not his acting abilities, so I have to assume it was because he was forced into contortions. Ones that he could have made the movie better if he were allowed to be himself.The suspense and sound are good, as in SotL. The shots are crisp. The editing is good.My overall feeling was that I was seeing a second-hand SotL, so I was a little disappointed. Still, it is much better than H was."
4,****4 stars****,"Better then the previous prequel 'Manhuter'. ToothFairy is a lot more sinister in this version (thanks to the extraordinary Ralph Fiennes, can't wait to see him as Voldmort). Anthony Hopkins could play Hannibal Lector in his sleep. Strong performance by both Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Emily Watson. Thought Edward Norton gave a very lack luster performance, nothing like his in American History X or Primal Fear, so he was the weak link. Very erie feel to the movie. Has one or two rough spots but all in all I would diffently recommend this movie."
4,"Very good, low-key adaption of Harris's novel","I liked the first attempt to bring ""Red Dragon"" to the screen, 1986's ""Manhunter"", but I actually prefer this version. It is not as fast-paced, and the secondary characters are generally better developed, making it easier to care about what happens to them.""Manhunter"" may have been a bit closer to the letter, as some claim, but to me ""Red Dragon"" is the better movie.Brian Cox was excellent as Hannibal Lecter in ""Manhunter"", but you just can't beat Anthony Hopkins, and Edward Norton is sublime as Special Agent Will Graham, the man who captures Hannibal Lecter.But it's Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dolarhyde who really steals the show, bringing an incredible depth and nuance to what could very easily be a stereotypical character, and ""Red Dragon"", unlike the gory ""Hannibal"", is certainly worthy of its relationship to ""Silence Of The Lambs"", even if ""Lambs"" is ultimately a better and more original story.Definitely recommended."
3,it was ok...,"This did not live up to hype, I heard it was really gory. You remeber how the other two movies had a scene or two that made them really sick, this one doesnt have anything like that(even though some are claiming it does.) No scene in here topped the last sceen on hanibal, or the crossdressor in the silence. On top of this, my only other complaint is this is too much like the original, it trys way too hard to be, yet it is not even close."
3,"Didn't stick to the original plot, but whatever.","This is the prequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"", and it kind of lays out the story very nicely. I enjoyed ""Silence"". I thought ""Hannibal"" was MUCH too graphic, and it made me physically sick... however, I did enjoy the movie. I thought that ""The Candyman"" wasn't built enough. He should have been more muscular, as the storyline defines him as a big, strong, weightlifter, etc... and he's not. He's a skinney guy with a bad ass tattoo. Anthony Hopkins did a great job in this, as he's done in the past, and I was impressed by Edward Norton. He's the man. Rent it, and watch it in the dark with someone you love."
2,When Good Actors Do Bad Things,"Wow-what a horrible movie. This is really sad to me. I love Silence of the Lambs, didn't see Hannibal, and really expected great things from this film. Everyone is really great in it, which is why I can't figure out exactly why this movie is so bad. The genius detective thing is really embarrassing to watch. Everything is predictable and silly and trite. This might be one of the worst written screenplays I've seen in a while. This really breaks my heart, I'm sorry Sir Anthony, I'm sorry Edward Norton, I'm sorry Ralph and Emily, and I'm really really sorry Phillip Seymour Hoffman - You're one of my top three favorite actors, why, why, why???"
5,"Much better than ""Manhunter""!","Much more watchable than ""Manhunter"". This film has style, is well-acted, and doesn't feel so ""1980's"", unlike ""Manhunter"". Plus, it features Sir Anthony doing his thing as Hannibal.Highly recommended."
1,SUCKED,This movie sssssuuuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkkkeeeeeeeddddd. that isright sucked. it was a sucker movie
4,Better than Manhunter,"A lot of people insist that the original movie Manhunter was far superior than this movie. I am forced to disagree. In this film the characters are far more gruesome. Their is no real sense of fear or awe of Hannibal in Manhunter. In the Red Dragon Anthony Hopkins reprises his role and does an awesome job of it.Edward Norton plays Will Graham the agent that caught Hannibal Lecter. He is brought out of retirement to hunt down the latest serial killer ""the tooth fairy"" played superbly by Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes gives the tooth fairy the haunting presence that Manhunter sorely lacked. The movie basically follows Graham's hunt for the tooth fairy as well as visiting with Hannibal on several occasions for help. It is a good movie that would have deserved 5 stars if it were not for the Silence of the lambs being so superbly done."
4,Wow!,The best hannibal yet. it was interesting to see how he got started and it was equally interesting to see that there is someone out there who was as sick as hannibal. I highly reccommend this movie and the fact that it lasted over 2 hours wasn't even evident until I left the theater.
2,Inferior To The Original,"This is an almost word for word remake of the 1986 film ""Manhunter."" While watching this one I kept asking myself why. Why did someone decide to remake a prefectly good film? This remake adds nothing, in fact it is inferior to Manhunter in many ways. Poor casting is just the beginning of the problem. I never bought Anthony Hopkins as a psycho in any of these in the series. In this one he plays it way over the top in an almost cartoonish manner. Ed Norton does an OK job as Will Graham, but this role could have been done equally well by anyone. Most annoying is Ralph Fiennes as the Tooth Fairy. This guy sleepwalks through the role and is about as authentic as a wooden nickel. The film concludes with a lame ""he's not really dead"" cliche. This was the choice to make it different from Manhunter? Silly. Two stars for the always interesting Harvey Keitel. Skip this one and rent the far superior Manhunter instead."
2,In my opinion,"Graham's character is portrayed much better in Manhunter. In Red Dragon, his empathy appears to be a psychic ability because they never really define his struggle. The psychological result of thinking like a serial killer is the focus of Manhunter, and they pull it off nicely.That being said, Dolarhyde's character is done much better in Red Dragon. He gets a lot more screentime than in Manhunter, and we really get to see the 'non-beast' side of him. In my opinion, this characterization is what truly made the movie.Hannibal Lechter just felt like dead weight in Red Dragon; he never really helped the investigation. In Manhunter, his inclusion merely served to awaken those old serial killer thoughts in Graham. In Red Dragon they try to make him more than that, and it comes off very flat."
3,Tooth fairy,"Don't expect a film better than ""Silence of the Lambs"" because ""Red Dragon"" is far from that. This is the prequel to that film and a replacement for the 1986 film ""Manhunter"".""Red Dragon"" once again stars Anthony Hopkins as the excellent Hannibal Lector, whom Edward Norton ""consults"" with to find out more about the Tooth Fairy serial killer. The Tooth Fairy is played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The only problem is, it is a very long time into the film where he does anything frightening. ""Silence of the Lambs"" had multiple suspense moments, whereas Red Dragon really lacks in this department.Overall, I was quite disappointed with ""Red Dragon"". I found Edward Norton very dull, and too long before anything interesting happened.For die-hard fans of the series only."
2,Don't Do It!!,"Red Dragon is a terrible, formulaic flick with good actors but nauseating writing.Not only are almost all events and details plot devices (oh, how I dream of a day of character development without excessive leveraging for plot line) but they aren't really interesting. Imagery is not great (I had AT LEAST expected good imagery) and I was not put on the edge of my feet. The clincher at the end was not fun, exciting, or creative. Only watch this movie if you have to watch your favorite actors in action (and don't expect all that much action). -K"
1,Watch Manhunter Instead,"My biggest complaint with this movie is that Ed Norton is a very pale version of Will Graham, the FBI uber-psychological profiler the character is supposed to be. Norton is weak and whiny and should have never won the role simply because he does not live up to the Will Graham in 'The Red Dragon.' Norton was beefed up more for 'Keeping the Faith' than he was for 'Dragon.' This in and of itself made the movie very lame for me.Other than that this movie was pretty true to the book but I still give the original 'Manhunter' movie 5 stars and two thumbs up."
4,Very Distrubing - See the hidden side of Hannibal,"I saw this movie Friday at the Mall of Georgia at 4:30. I must admit this is a truely distrubing picture, unlike any of the previous pictures. The actors did a great job. You really see a nasty side to Hannibal. I believe that the film makers were worried that people like Hannibal too much. I kinda of wish that I didn't see this movie. I thought it was going to be like the other two movies. So BEWARE! I would have to agree with Hannibal's last statement somewhat. We are somewhat a primative society in a lot of ways, regardless of all the computers and high tech. weapons. Anyways, I would have something fun to do after this movie like a comedy or something else. Hey! a lot of the movie is in Georgia so that is cool."
2,Prequel,"Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal Lector in this prequel to Silence of the Lambs. FBI agent returns after capturing Lector, to be called into duty to hunt for a killer called ""The Tooth Fairy."" Even though Lector is one of Hollywood's great villains and Hopkins' performance fine, it fails to deliver the chils or any surpries any way for that matter this mediccre sequel. If people were influenced by the media, every time they saw a killer like this they would comit homicide. Easily the worst entry in the series though fine in many respects."
4,"Not quite as good as ""Silence,"" much better than ""Hannibal""","In a story set before the events of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" FBI investigator Will Graham (Edward Norton) returns from an early retirement to hunt for a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) with assistance from the imprisoned Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins, of course). I was leery about this one, especially because the director, Brett Ratner, has not done very much good work in the past. However, he really rose to the challenge here. He understands the Lecter character and has put together a very suspenseful, scary movie. The outstanding cast does a wonderful job. Ted Tally, who wrote the screenplay for SOTL, also took on the writing chores here and acquitted himself well."
3,Intuition,"Angela Bofill is one of the singers whose georgeous voice shines through even though I find this disc a little too producer driven and on some songs, that seems to shadow her voice.Although as a whole, this is not one of my favorite Angela Bofill albums, I do have a few favorite songs: DOWN THE LINE, FOR YOU & I, EVERLASTING LOVE, LOVE IS IN YOUR EYES & a great remake, I JUST WANNA STOP.Overall, it is a good disc for her fans to add to their collection but to the uninitiated, I'd recommend sticking to her earlier releases to get a better sense of this magnificent woman's talent."
5,Uppa Vista Rocks,We own and adore this stroller and prefer it to the Bugaboo and several others we have owned. Here are the pros:*Seat Height/Bassinet Height is higher and healthier (less exhaust and back strain) plus you do not need a highchair while out at restaurants as it is table height.*great steering/ride with soft non popping tires and cushy suspension and height adjustible handle)*Huge basket - really really big!*Not even a little tippy*Ventilated Bassinet*Folds with seat attachedIf you are looking for a full sized do it all stroller I cannot think of another that has as much to offer!
2,"Pretty, but.....","My husband and I needed to buy a new set of everyday glasses. We decided on this set because they are American made. We love the look of these glasses as well as the price, but are concerned as to the overall quality. The first shipment arrived with one glass shattered and another grossly misshapen. Amazon replaced the set, but the new set still doesn't have great overall quality with obvious seams and slightly misshapen edges."
2,Pretty Cheap Glasses,"I gave these a two star rating because shipping was fairly quick and nothing was broken. I will however not buy these again and will replace this set. The glasses have seams, like a pair of pants or something. Never saw anything like it. They are not heavy and break easily, not good for a family with children. I usually like Anchor products, but not this set!"
3,broken glass,"The glasses are great. Unfortunately, They were not packaged very well & two of the glasses were broken when they arrived."
3,It'll do,"I have two teenage teens in the house with occasional teenaged guests so drinking glass get broken or just disappear from time to time so I was shopping for something inexpensive and pleasant looking. I think I could have bought these at the local chain store but you never know if they will have the pattern that you want. The glasses look nice except for two visible mold marks on each glass that was left when the glasses were made. It makes them look cheap. But hey, they were cheap. It'll do till the kids are gone."
2,"Pretty, but look for something else.","I bought this set at Wal-Mart 4 years ago. I am now down to three of the smaller cups, all others have broken. Most broke in the dishwasher within 6 months. Nothing fell on them, they just broke some time during the cycle. One glass recently broke in my hand while I wash hand washing it. I stuck my hand inside to clean it, and it shattered and sliced my hand. So no matter how gentle you are with these, they will break. It is a shame, because they are very pretty and I have not seen any others like them. The glass near the top is just way too thin."
1,90% broken in 6 months,"I ordered these from Amazon to supplement a set we had bought a few years prior at Target. It's been just over 6 months and I have NONE of the small glasses and only 4 large ones left. They broke in the dishwasher, they broke in the sink, etc. They were not nearly the quality of my original set. It's too bag because I love the slight design on them, but the glass was so thin even if it didnt break outright, we had a crack running the length of the glass. Unusable."
3,"Ok, but somewhat cheap looking.","I bought these seeing they looked nice on the picture. It must have been airbrushed or something, because when you actually see what you get, it's unclear, wavy and muddled looking glass, with an uneven rim and a VERY visible seam. Cheap looking.I was trying to stock up a home bar for future coctail parties, but, I'm not sure these glasses are good enough. A little embarrassing that they look so cheap. Then again, they are only $7.89 at walmart as of November 2012.The larger issue I have is the size. They seem too big to be used as a ""rocks"" glass. I guess I knew that though, but it's almost impossible to find any normal sized glasses. The small glasses in this set is as big as the tallest largest drinking glasses we had. The big one, well, could be used for a pint or quart gallon of beer I guess."
1,Should be banned.,"I bought this set on sale at Walmart for $9.99 in Jan 2012. While using them two broke one in the dishwasher and the other was broken when a cup banged against it. I've banged glasses before without this happening. This is very cheap and very brittle glass and breaks so easily. Recently I was handwashing one of the larger glasses and this glass broke into two pieces with my hand still inside the glass. I went into shock.., the glass pierced my hand just an inch below the thumb knuckle. I think I was very lucky and believe this incident could have been worse if the broken glass had caught my wrist or severed an artery. Be very careful with these glasses."
2,Training would be effective if it weren't for the errors....,"This book is full of errors, errors that an editing team should have caught. Errors include directing you to use files that its claims you have created but have not and refering to file paths that are completely wrong. I am only through half of the book and luckily the first half has been mostly review of things I learned with previous versions of Flash, if I was a total beginner I think the errors in the book would have really impeaped my progress. That said I am scared of doing the next half of the book because it is stuff that I am not too familiar with and the errors will probaly screw me. Macromedia needs to reedit this and offer all of us who already brought the book a exchange program. Where as before I really trusted books from the Training From the Source series, I feel a little wary about buying more, and I really want to get the Actionscript 2.0 book."
1,NOT for beginners,"This book requires some previous knowledge of Flash as it says in the introduction of the book. This important piece of information is not on the Amazon page. I am a total beginner and am lost by page 7. I also ran into the error early on about a file I was supposed to have created. I'm a bit wary of the Training from the source series now. I used the ""Dummies"" series to get up to speed on Dreamweaver and may go to the Dummies for Flash 8."
1,I wish that I checked this out before I bought.,I can't believe that Macromedia allowed this book to be published under it's LOGO.You can't get a listing of Eratta from Peachpit or Green himself.
1,Not the best choice,"If you are looking for clear instruction in Flash, this is not the best choice. This book is filled with errors from the start. I'm so surprised that a book subtitled ""Training from the source"" could be so terrible. It's almost as if the book was written, but never edited for problems."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This book isn't really worth buying - if you're new to Flash, then just take the tutorials that ship with the programme, which adequately explain the Flash interface, tweening, masks, library etc....the only useful nuggets, which aren't explained in the tutorials are to do with treatment of vectors, bitmaps, video and optimisation techiques. Furthermore, 1 chapter on actionscript is a joke - far too brief and uninformative to be really useful - just buy Colin Moocks, Actionscript - A definitive guide and you're sorted....."
1,AWFUL!,"Did anybody proofread this book? If Macromedia had bothered to have someone unfamiliar with the book work through the exercises they would have discovered that just the first chapter has more errors than you can shake a stick at. The book refers to files on the disk that don't exist. You're told to load a file that 'you created earlier in this lesson' which has never been mentioned before. It's as though entire pages have been deleted from this book, yet the information on those pages is refered to later. After a few very frustrating hours with this book I'm ready to pitch it out the window.This is one of the most poorly edited books that I've ever seen. Macromedia should be embarrassed to have their name on it. It is a total waste of both your money and your time."
2,"Found an error, like the others","Like the other reviewers, this would have been good if not for the errors. I was working lesson 2 making a dynamic TV remote and was frustrated that it didn't work. Well, I did my own troubleshooting and found that on pg.59 they refer to a movie clip titled ""cableBox_mc"" when their demo file has the clip named ""cableBox"" and so it doesn't work. On top of that, the dynamic text field is defaulted to black text on a black background, so even after I found the first bug, the text didn't show right. Once I changed the dynamic text attributes to white text instead of black, the code worked fine. However, I am a beginner (like the other reviewers), and shouldn't need to troubleshoot my teacher's code."
1,"Damn, I wish I'd read the reviews first!","Just like one of the other reviewers I was appalled to find that the files referred to in chapter 1 of the book were not on the training disk--and that the author referred to an as-yet unstarted exercise as a starting point. Well, I tried...I tried to deconstruct--to pick the files out of the finished piece, and reconstruct---but nothing worked---layers, evverything--not the right information. Do these books and training disks get revised contantly, independently, independently of one another? Or is this miserable book part of the dissolution of Macromedia as it merged with Adobe. Book sucks!"
4,Great companion to this book is site with errata by its author,"The author's online site for this book at <a href=""http://www.tomontheweb3.ca"">http://www.tomontheweb3.ca</a> includes detailed errata for each chapter as well as additional resources. Together they make a much stronger learning tool than the book by itself."
2,A VITRIOLIC ATTACK,TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY EVERYBODY IN THE CHURCHILL FAMILY WAS A FAILURE.CHURCHILLOPHOBIA ALL THE WAY.
5,Puro Camilo,"I really like this ""comeback"" album. The second song ""Amor, que me has hecho?"" has become a Camilo ""greatest hit"". His voice is clear and strong and it is a pleasure to listen to his vocalizations. I recommend this album for camilistas as well as those who want to become acquainted with la musica latina."
4,Very Good Book-BUT !!!!!!!!!!!,"This book has the information you need for lightwave. Very informative here.However my only complaint with Lightwave books is that they are all in Black and White. I do not understand why they cannot make these books with full color gloss pages like the Maya books.I love to read computer books that have lots of graphic explainations.Black and white books are for programmers, not artist.Otherwise than that this book will give you what you need for lightwave"
5,Helped me get over the hump!,"I found this book to be the best LightWave beginner book on the market. The reviews on this book don't do it justice because it is just that good. The 'novice' guy that thinks the book is not for beginners must be reading something else because if you can't learn from Dan's quickstart chapter (chapter 1) then something is wrong with you. There are hours and horus of videos on the books dvd too that teach you step by step. Each chapter ramps you up from knowing nothing to understanding the program. The novice reviewer is the only 3 star review which makes me believe that its that same guy out to put down dan's stuff. Hey buddy - if you're so good, instead of writing anonymous reviews - go write your own book. Inside lightwave 8 rocks!"
5,I've owned them all,"I have purchased Inside Lightwave 3D, Inside Lightwave 6 & 7 and I recently purchased 8. I consider the Inside series must have's for any Lightwave owners. Not only for their excellent tutorials, but I have found them great ""reads"". Many nights I have found myself in bed reading them as they offer both the information I need as well as the inspiration I crave.Thanks Dan"
4,Very Good,"I would accually give this book a 4.5 if the option were avalible, but it's not. Just the first few pages were enough to get me started. I have only read through the first two chapters and I already have a good idea of what to do with most of the tools. However, no book could replace an actual class in the subject. As for the people who claim that this book sucks, well the book is meant to explain what a tool is ""supposed"" to do, not teach you how to use it. Half of these so-called ""tips & tricks by the pros"" are really accidents that look cool. Most of what you modle and animate will be an acident that looks good."
5,muevelo con el general,"I lived in Panama for 2.5 years and El General never got old. The Panamanians said that Muevelo had no real translation, but regardless of the translation, it meant the same to all of us, ""shake yo' thang."" All of El General's music moved everyone to the dance floor each time it was played."
4,RAGGATASTIC,"This is great, much better than Shabba Ranks. There' a lot of variety but it's all very bouncy, buoyant, poppy & paaaaarty. My faves are Buduff Kun Kun, El Gran Pana & Son Bow. So pleased I've discovered this artist. I don't understand a word of Spanish."
5,Guy Harvey Tshirt,"My husband loves the Guy Harvey shirts and this one is exceptional. The colors are so vibrant. They hold up so well after many, many washings."
1,I can only call this deceptive advertising,This Vendor calculates the savings percentage of a whole case to a single item that they sell at a a very high price. Do not buy from this vendor.
1,A total rip-off,This product is a total rip-off. It can be purchased at Lowes or Home Depot for less than half of thier cost. There is no discount here! Save your time and money and never buy from this company!!!
1,Buyer Beware,"Upon arrival item is lightweight. They claim that weight in description is a ""typo"" but is still not fixed (item weight is about 5#). Do not buy this item."
1,Not what I received,"The product I received is NOT what is pictured. I received only the hand rails that attach to the seat. Communicated with the seller and it took quite a while to hear from them, they themselves asked for a description of what I had ordered. Since then, I've asked for a refund for this purchase and am waiting to hear from both the seller and Amazon.I will not purchase from this seller again."
4,Only Slightly Drying,"Since my lips tend toward dryness, I have a difficult time with ANY long lasting lipstick, but Clinique's version is only SLIGHTLY drying and thus a good choice for me to wear to work. As another reviewer stated, Blushing Nude isn't as pink as it sounds, but it IS a nice neutral tone that tends toward a natural brownish pink without overpowering my lighter coloring."
3,"Fine Wotan,Uneven Ring","Oh,give me a break!Can ""ill focused voices"" sing three complete Wotans without to show any kind of fatigue by chance?On the contrary,I listen this complete,very uneven Ring production and I'm sure Struckmann is a strong reason 'cause this dvd set isn't completely irrelevant one.Interesting Kupfer's ideas here,but some whims like Loge and Alberich resembling Las Vegas' Siegfried&Roy,that Dracula's fiancée Erda(what a poor singing to this character!)and I'm not sure about these Power Rangers Fafner/Fasolt and gods dancing a ""minuetto"" at the time they should be ""over the rainbow"".Orchestra has serious problems in its horn/wagner tubas section and de Billy gets well ""Siegfried"" and ""Walküre"" (in despite that weak eight Brünhilde's sisters)but shows his lack of affinities with Wagner scores on ""Gotterdämmerung"",the lowest performance by his crew.Pick one or two parts of this set and keep your money to Bayreuth production reissue."
5,Floravital Iron & Herbs,"This product is great! My mother is anemic and takes a ferrous sulfate pill, but her hemoglobin kept dropping. With just one dose of this per day, her hemoglobin is back to normal. This is a great product."
5,Great Product To Boost Iron,"This is a great product to boost your iron. Tastes great too. Alittle expensive, but worth every cent to feel better."
4,iron I actually absorb,"I have trouble absorbing iron and after going thru four kinds of pills, my midwife recommended this. It tastes better then it used too, and I absorb this much better. wish it tasted a lil better though."
5,"Gluten-free, doesn't make me sick","The taste isn't too bad, and it's the only iron I've found that doesn't make me sick to my stomach. Whenever I start feeling sluggish, I remember I ran out of this stuff and get more. Within a few days of taking it again, I always feel more energized."
4,worth the expense!,"Energize yourself... Iron, B vits, herbs. Gentle on your stomach, taste is fair, works fast improving iron levels and overall feeling of wellbeing and energy. Competitive pricing on Amazon."
5,Excellent product!,Floradix iron and herbs is wonderful! It is plant based so it does not constipate and does not have metal shavings in it. Taking the recommended dose worked wonders for me as well as two friends that I insisted take it. I'm on my second bottle and will need a third soon!
1,Didn't work for me!,"I'm sorry to say that this product didn't work for me. i had my large intestine completely removed and i am not sure if this was the problem but within an hour after taking the first dose i was getting stomach cramps. i proceded not knowing this was the problem. After taking the second dose my abdominal cramps became worse and within 24 hours my small intestine was fully distended and i was having severe abdominal pain.Other people in my dept. are having success with this product. Maybe it was due to my circumstances, i don't know.I am not giving a bad review but one that states this did not work for me."
3,Not bad,the cap is way too big for the dose and I was getting too much. got horribly constipated. starting over with a smaller dose using a baby medicine spoon.
2,Expensive and Still Causes Contstipation,I shelled out $35 for two weeks of supplements because they told me that the formula was more bioavailable and also does not cause constipation. Well I most definitely am constipated after taking this supplement. Also it tastes terrible. I'm taking it back for a refund and going for ferrous sulfate tablets.
5,Did the trick - my iron levels came up!,"I bought this product because I am pregnant and my iron levels were on the low side. My midwife recommended that I begin taking an iron supplement and I had read that this one was highly bioavailable and did not cause constipation, like some others do. I'm glad I started taking it - my iron levels went up!"
5,A labor of love,"This book was produced by Milton Meltzer. It is a very moving record of Twain's life in which the many pictures are made more meaningful by Twain's accompanying words. It is the story of one who is printer, pilot, soldier, miner, reporter, lecturer, editor, humorist, businessman , publisher, and above all America's greatest comic writer."
4,Review for Barnie's Cool Cafe Blues Coffee,"The coffee arrived on time and is a very tasty coffee. I had this coffee at Barnie's cafe, but most of their cafes are closing up and so Amazon offered a way to get the coffee delivered to the house. I would not hesitate to order it again."
2,Chance Purchase,"Although the condition of the CD was excellent, I am disappointed in the quality of vocals on this collection of wonderful music."
5,Favorite Lampe Berger Fragrance,"This is, by far, my favorite Lampe Berger fragrance! Spicy with a little sweet, really captures the essence of New Orleans!"
3,I don't eat Meat... But...,"Yeah... I don't eat Meat and have been Meat-Free for Many many years but I love this bumper sticker lol. Everytime I read it, it cracks me up.When I was going to get my tattoo my friends and I seen this bumper sticker and my friend's yelled ""We've got one in the back seat!!"" To the driver of the car lol."
1,So you'd like to save a cow....,"Why not eat a vegetarian instead of a cow today? Or better yet, you can eat a fellow cow eater and save TWO* cows! (The cow that you would have eaten and the cow they would have eaten.)But if you've run out of vegetarians to eat or simply don't like cannibalism, here's a radical idea: You could stop eating products made with beef, stop buying leather, and avoid dairy. (To make milk profitable to sell, the male calves become veal calves. Dairy and beef are part of the same industry.)*Astute readers will see that the math has been over-simplified."
2,Shipping took forever and defective stakes,I ordered these stakes on Dec 6th and was told they would be at my house by Dec 13th. I did not receive them until Dec 19 which left me not very much time to display my Christmas lights. The stakes worked well except for a few of them that were defective stakes. I would not do business with them again.
3,"No head ""stop"" and the head is easily broken off","Like all stakes of this type, the head folds down and latches in place. However, there are two problems with this brand of stakes. One, when the head snaps in place there is nothing to keep it from continuing downwards. Thus, the weight of the lamp and cord cause the lamp holder to ""droop"" and the lamps to be poorly aligned. Two, the part that bends is made of a very weak plastic. If you bend it back to its upright position for storage, then down again just a few times the head will break off. Ifyou buy these, be certain to buy an extra package to replace the ones that break."
3,Not as good as the TV show,The questions keep repeating over and over and the game gets very boring after a while. Then why do I give it 3 stars? because the graphics and Regis are great. I'd wait until a new version came out if I were you though.
1,Who Wants to Waste 20 Bucks?,"Absolutely awful! I am eleven years old and I LOVE the TV show, but this game was a total disappointment. The timer made it unrealistic, the questions were repetitive, and the voice of Regis was REALLY annoying and mean! Nothing at all like the real show. I played this game with my dad, and neither one of us thought it was worth anything. Definitely DO NOT waste your money on it!"
1,Hundreds of questions? I got to about 10....,"I got through about 10 questions, then they started to repeat...is there a flaw in my copy? Maybe there's a new question sometimes, but, they still repeat, which sucks up the fun. I love the TV show, but the game doesn't live up to the potential. My piece of crap processor can't handle the good graphics, which are snail-slow, and Regis is pretty annoying in the game, too. 20 bucks is a small price to pay for expectations, but a big price to pay for such a stupid game. Wanna be a millionaire? Save money on this game."
1,Who Wants To Get Ripped-Off,"This CD-Rom (from the makers of the great ""You Don't Know Jack"" series) is a huge disappointment! Because of the huge amount of data required for the annoying ""Phone-A-Friend"" feature, the number of questions on the disc is drastically reduced. As noted in other reviews here -- the first 10 questions literally repeat in consecutive games!The sound and graphics are merely o.k and Regis is as smarmy as ever.Beware of any title that can be prepared in such a short amount of time. Clearly intended to simply ride the ""Millionaire"" wave through the holiday shopping season."
2,Who Wants to be a Millionaire,Great game but...not nearly enough questions. After a couple of hours almost all questions are repeats.
1,You can have mine for free!,"This was the worst $ I've ever spent. The graphics are fine for the first hour, but then the questions repeat, repeat, repeat.The questions are very simplistic and are not similar at all to those on the show.Save your money here and buy Jeopardy!PS - I love the TV show - just hate this game."
1,There should br a free update,I bought this game for a friend and we played only 6 rounds before starting to get repeat questions. It was very disappointing. They should have allowed you to run the game from your hard drive and included an additional database cd with more questions. If it wasn't for the repeats this would have been a very cool game.
2,"Good, but needs more work","First and foremost, the game needs more material. The questions repeat WAY too much than they ought to. Computer games I have from ten years ago don't repeat this often! The other problem with the game is that Regis does not ask you, ""Is that your final answer?"" until you answer at $500,000. He should start saying that at the $1,000 level. Regis also doesn't read the question, and the questions are timed. On the show, you could use the whole show on one question, though I'm sure they'd edit that down to an extent. But the game is pretty good. What they need to do is cut down on phone-a-friends (they have four per question!), and do more on the game material. But I did get to the million before the game started repeating, and so I'm glad of that."
2,Won't Load,"I have all the requirements, but it still won't load onto my PC or laptop. I haven't had a chance to see how bad it is. I should have read the reviews before I put it on my Christmas wish list."
3,It would have been fine...it just didn't work!,"Now I have nothing against the TV show. Tis game has a fastest-finger question. Me and my brother tried to do a F-F question. When we didn't do it fast enough virtual Regis Philbin said good-bye and the game went away! Fun, but has some bugs in it."
2,Don't waste your money; Only fun for first 1/2 hr-1 hr,"At first, I was very excited about getting this game. When I got it, I really enjoyed it. It started out as a solid 4-star game, great questions, sarcasm from Regis, heart-pounding music, it had it all. The only initial problem was that the first few questions were too hard. But then after 1 hr. of playing it...WHAT WAS I THINKING WHEN I BOUGHT THIS GAME! The questions kept repeating, and repeating, and repeating! After playing it for 2 days of playing 1 hr. each day, I can get up to $125,000 almost everytime because I remember all the answers! Besides the very limited supply of questions, the multiplayer game was also pretty bad. Given, there are more good things about it then there are bad things, but the bad things are absolutely unforgivable. The only reason to get this game would be to learn about 200 new facts (the # of questions) because you're guaranteed to remember ALL of them after only about a week of playing."
3,"It's OK, But I Can Get A Million Every Time I Play!","The thing is that there isn't enough questions. Not NEARLY enough questions. I can get a mill every time cause I memorised all the answers! Sheesh! Get the 2nd edition, there's more questions, and it's actually hard, except one question... (How many eyes does a giraffe have? Yi! ) Really, even if you don't have this version, get the second edition and don't waste your money on this. Enjoy!^_^ Chibi Rose"
1,Ruth from L.V. Jan. 8 2000,"Recieved the game for xmas, at first it was a lot of fun, but then it was the same questions over and over, not much fun anymore, Im sure they could have done better, Don't buy!"
1,No question,"I bought this game as a gift over Christmas, and we had funplaying it for about half an hour. That is when questions started torepeat themselves! I think this game must have something like total of 100 questions after three or 4 tims playing it you get repeats. If you're expecting something like Trivial Pursuit with Regis this is not the game. Do not buy this game, I feel so bad seeing this game at number one. Save your 20 dollars and buy boardgame Trivial Pursuit instead, you will have about 100 times more fun for only 10 dollars more."
3,Good buy for inspiring Millionaire's!,I thought this game was very interesting! I found myself and family members huddling around the computer to try to win the million! The special effects were great. Although I did experiance the repeats like others had mentioned.
2,Regis is still annoying,"This game is fun to start out with. Then it gets old, just about as old as Regis himself. Not to challenging you want funpick up you dont know jack. All in all this is a total waste of money to me and my friends. The show is an A the Game is a D, have fun and dont get caught buying this game."
1,insulting,"As a teacher of educable mentally impaired middle school students, I can only say one thing, ""Your CD version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"", is extremely insulting. I brought it to class for game day and the kids were thrilled! We sat down to play and didn't quite get the two or more player directions displayed on the screen. It was then that Regis started calling us ""dummies"" as well as ""pathetic"" and then shuts down the game! Can you imagine the reactions of these kids who already suffer from low self-esteem. What is the deal with Regis firing these abusive names and coments at the players. You should be absolutly ashamed at this type of name calling which we absolutely discourage at our school as well as in the home. ""Get rid of the degrading comments, Regis"". The kids are writing a letter today in composition class. I think an apology is in order.Sincerely, Debi Ruggeri"
2,"Not worth the time, and thats my final answer.","Purchasing this game I had the high expectations of experiencing the same enjoyment as I do while watching the game while it is on TV. Unfortunately I was greatly disappointed. While at the beginning it is enjoyable (mostly for the novelty sake) the questions quickly begin repeating themselves which make this game not worth the time or the effort. If you are indeed a fan of the show, the second version is indeed better although they still appear to be in a need to make a fast buck off of this game. My overall suggestion would be to continue to wait until the programmers spend more time and effort on this game rather that continually trying to make a fast buck off of the novelty of the show."
3,IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY FUN,It's a pain to see the same questions but when new ones pop up they are very good and challenging. The phone a friend people mostly don't know what they're talking about but Regis' wit and the shows music and graphics are outstanding. More questions=5 stars. Buy the game. It's pretty fun.
2,good but needs work,i think they rushed this game for xmas! I could only play it once and then i have to reinstall it to play it again i went to the website and found so many pages of troubles with the game. i belive buy the book insted you'll be happier with that because i took mine back and got the book
5,GOOD GAME BUT MY AUNT HATES IT,Let's face it i'm a giant Millionaire fan and was so psyched when the cdrom game came out. When I have time I still play it. But i'll tell who was the big naysayer when I played it. My aunt actually couldn't answer all the questions and couldn't even get past the FF round then finally got discouraged when Regis gave her the wrong answer. But what can you expect from a not really true Millionaire fan who was smart than her true fan niece. But with my help my aunt knew how to play. This is a really cool game which I think is really easy. Now if a Meredith Veira hosted 4th edition comes out
1,Insipid version of a passing fad,"When Millionaire first was on in the summer of 1999, I was thoroughly addicted. This was novel, new television. Now, of course, it's repetitive and boring, but for a while there was really a spark there.The computer game, however, always.... It hogged memory, was hard to control, and wasn't very much fun. It's sad, but the online free version at ABC.com was a lot more fun. I generally don't like games where there's no flexibility and very little fun, so if you're like me (and I would hope so!), avoid this one!"
2,Repeating Questions,The game is good (if you like the show's concept) except for the repeating questions. The reason that there are so many repeating questions is because every question has a phone a friend lifeline which is actually carried out...you have to listen to 30 seconds of audio of a friend explaining their answer...I imagine that the CD is all filled up with these 30 second audio monologues. It's a cute concept but I would have preferred text to the audio so there could be 100's of more questions.Buy Jeopardy instead...it's more fun and the questions don't repeat as often.
2,NO QUESTIONS!,"This game had lots of potential! Regis is exciting in the game, the graphics are nice (although they never change), and it's fun! However, questions repeat and repeat and repeat! IT IS NO FUN! If winning a Million was this easy the show wouldn't even be on! LOL THIS GAME REALLY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT! IT SHOULDN'T BE LEGAL!"
2,"Great theme, horrible game","If you really like Who Want's to Be a Millionaire, like the multitude of television watchers that does, this game is almost worth the price. As said many times before, the questions begin to repeat soon after installing. Good graphics for a trivia game, humiliating remarks from Regis... it's good entertainment for a few days. Instead of this product, I would personally recommend the You Don't Know Jack series..."
3,"Great, but needs improvements","I'm a little disappointed I spent [money] on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, however, I have read the reviews on this site, and I'd like to make a few comments. First of all, yes, the number of available questions is too low, but it takes up a lot of space on the CD for each question. The Phone-a-friend lifeline, for instance, plays a sound file. FOR EACH QUESTION. If you wanted 2,500 questions, the game would need to ship on 15 CD's! It's forgivable, considering the overall quality of everything else in the game, but I think people who buy this game should be entitled to free updates/replacements when the improved version of WWTBAM is released.Overall, very fun and true to the show, but very limited number of questions, the fact that they didn't include a SKIP button for some graphics/sound (does Regis EVER stop talking? ^_^), and a horrible multiplayer mode, detracts from what could otherwise be a very enjoyable game."
1,"BORING, DISAPPOINTING, and out $20.00","Loaded up the game at 5:00. Saw the first repeat question at 5:20. No joke. The questions were ok the first time they came up, but after a couple hours, anyone who can remember their phone number can get to the big one. We had heard negative reviews, but love the tv game, and decided to give it a shot. It was a $20.00 mistake. You'll read some positive reviews, but in all honesty I feel this game is a con. I cannot believe they didnt have some sort of testing done before release. It is sad."
2,Good for about an hour,"The first few times through, this game is entertaining. However, I've never seen a game that repeated questions so quickly.I've owned Jeopardy for a year and only occasionally get a repeat. I got repeat questions the first day I owned this.Save your money, don't buy this one."
1,Just like in the hot seat,"The pressure is on! I was at the $1 million question and suddenly I became really nervous, just like I would've on the real show! The question was about Aesop's fables. I used my 50-50 and the remaining answers were A & D. Then I used my final lifeline and phoned a friend. Regis's friend said it was A. I agreed with him and it was my final answer. YES! I HAD WON A MILLION DOLLARS! You might think it would've calmed me down, bt guess what? It made me even more nervous! This game is not worth it unless you want to rattle your insides. If you wanna feel the pressure and do the game, try the second edition. I haven't played it yet, but I think there'll be much less pressure. Although if you're smart, you might win $64,000 on your first game (like I did.) Also: THe questions keep repeating. Avoid this game like it is a mosquito or a bee or a wasp or something like that."
1,Who Would Want To Buy This Game?,"The game, like most, is ok at first but then gets very repeatitive. It is not worth wasting your time, money, and energy to get this title. What makes it worse is regis is in it with his annoying voice, over and over again. Believe me,YOU DONT WANT TO BUY THIS GAME! Good advice, take it or leave it."
2,Big rip off!,"This is one of the worst toys i ever got. I got it on christmas eve and by christmas day I had already started getting only old questions. Now, a week later, I have not got a new question in 4 days and i play it at least 1 time everyday."
1,"Disney Magic-Take your money,give you garbage",Play this game only if you had your brain recently removed. Even then with the questions repeating so often you will get the million. For twenty bucks I expected more than 200 questions. My first grader could put together a better version of this piece of trash. This will be the last time Disney Interactive gets my money. We know who really gets to be the millionaire.
2,disappointed,"I was really excited about getting Who Wants to Be A Millionaire. The graphics are well done, and the game is much like the television version. Yet, after just a couple of hours, we began to get a repeat of questions. After just two days of owning this product, I'm lucky to get any new questions. Needless to say, I'm a Millionaire!"
2,"Repeat, after repeat.","Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, is lacking the one thing that could make it a mega-blockbuster. After just two hours of playing the game I started getting repeats. They need to come out with a add on pack with more questions. Ether that or give everyone their money back. If you our looking for a game that is good for just two hours of fun then you have found the game for you."
2,needs more questions,The graphics are great and the cyber-Regis is a nice touch but this game is SERIOUSLY lacking enough questions. After about 10 games I started seeing some questions for the second time.
2,Mixed review,"This game is GREAT for about 15-20 games. After that, the questions start repeating. If you are looking for one evening of fun and not much more, get it."
3,Initially a fun game but gets annoying fast . . .,"I've had the game for three days and played less than ten times each day. I did not get any repeat questions the first day. But on the second day, I started getting repeat questions. In one game, my first four questions were ones I had already seen before which was annoying. As you keep playing more games, don't be surprised if at least three or more questions are repeats depending on how far you get. This game should have more questions to really be fun.On the plus side, the sound and graphics are great. It really is just like the TV show. Thus, for the money, I would recommend the game if you really like the TV show."
2,Great Black Screen to Go with Every Question!,"We got this game free in a box of Corn Chex. We thought, Oh this will be fun since the show is cool. So we got home and played it and it was so annoying! There's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background. Just, don't buy it if you want to have any fun."
2,A very depressing effort that could've been so much more,"When Disney Interactive released ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" in early 2000, they anticipated a very warm response to the disc, which had a firm but low opening price. However, when actually being played, the game is sure to depress. If it isn't crudely simple, the design is poor and uninspired. The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing: Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again. ""Be Sure to come back to... Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" ""I hope you'll join me again on... Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" If one doesn't decide to resell (or simply trash) this game within its first week of purchase, they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves. Don't waste your time on this pitiful effort."
2,Who Wants to Be Dissapointed?,"Since this game was developed by Jellyvision, and since I run the only website about their You Don't Know Jack games (I don't know if Amazon let's you post URLs) I was looking forward to this title. Let's just say that, it was a dissapointment. The questions repeated ad nauseum, the opening 5 questions, which are supposed to be really easy, were real tough, and Regis didn't really appear in the game. His voice just popped in from time to introduce the next question, but he doesn't actually read the questions. (And he seemed a bit more sarcastic than usual.)Basically, this game has the soul of Jack but it's trapped in Regis' body. I think maybe Disney Interactive didn't give Jellyvision a lot of time to get this out the door, but here's hoping that they learned from their mistakes."
2,"Fun, repeative, annoying","This game sounded good, but wasn't. the questions repeat so much. I played 3 times and had the same question asked each time. Regis is so annoying. His comments can be mean and when we don't answer the fastest finger question the game shuts off and we have turn it back on and watch the opening credits , wich you can't skip. It's fun (for a couple of nights),but not for long. Buy it if you like the show and have nothing else to do, but otherwise save the $$$ or wait for a new version to come out because they rushed this one."
1,a total waste of money,"Believe me, I would give this game zero stars if Amazon.com allowed me.I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you. This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market. I mean, the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isn't very high. If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force: Landwarrior. Your time would be better spent with those games ."
2,Free with the purchase of a box of cereal (I am NOT joking),"Free, with the purchase of a specific brand of rice-flavored cereal: Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, 1st Edition. The complete game. Yes, the CD is right there on the front of the cereal box.Does anything else need to be said?"
1,Who wants to waste their money?,"I bought this CD rom when over in the US from the UK, being a huge fan of the show, I got it home and thought it was a joke. Regis isn't funny, the clock kept beating me and every time I used a lifeline I seemed to lose on it. The highest i've got to is $64,000 and I don't think I'm that stupid. The questions repeat too much and the clock, kept making me make stupid errors. Another thing that really annoyed me, is the levels of questions. I often found questions for $8,000 or $16,000 easier than ones for $100 or $200. If you want to play this game without spending about 20 dollars. Go to ABC.com and play their online game, It's better than the CD Rom"
2,Entertaining for a short period of time,"I think that the review at the top of this game has it right -- not enough questions. Also, the $100 through $1000 questions are too hard (compared to the TV show).Another annoying feature is the inability to skip past stuff that you have seen a million times, that is redundant to you.I bought this game out of boredom, and I think that I paid about $... for it. If you like the TV show, then don't pay any more than that. But, if you see it on the rack real cheap, then hey, pick it up."
2,A Bad Game!,"The only thing good about this game is that it is cheap! The question keep repating after 2 or 3 games, and the pictures are really bad. Save your money on something better."
2,Just borrow a friend's,"This game is very interesting if you are buying it to play every once and a while or to share with family and friends. As others have said, the questions start to repeat early on. I think the questions are more difficult than on the real show and the lifelines do not have the same effect. ***I DO recommend playing this game but I would share with family and friends because it does become repetitive so quickly. Hopefully it is because they wanted to get the game out around the holidays and in the future will offer upgrades or additional questions."
3,Almost A Home Run,"The music, the graphics, the swirling camera around the set... even Regis and his smarty pants wit are all dead on in this game.But, geez did they drop the ball on this one with the number of possible questions!After about two hours of play (approx. 20 games) some of the questions from previous contests began to pop up here and there in new games. So, don't expect to get countless hours of fresh brain twisters with this version.Still tons of fun to play, though----and extremely addictive. Go for it!"
2,Who wants to get ripped off?,"Loved the TV show which is why I bought the game. As other reviews stated, the same questions started repeating after only a few rounds. It seems that this software was rushed to market so it could beat the holiday rush. Was hoping for the game to run more like Jeopardy which blows this game away."
1,Should be zero stars,After playing a couple of times the questions repeat themselves.Save your money.This was a shameless attempt by Disney to cash in on the show.
2,You will be a millionaire...,"Okay, so I just got this for Christmas...I read a lot of the comments on here around the time it first came out and was hesitant to buy it myself...I already knew what to expect after playing it a few times. The graphics are nice at first, but get a bit tired. I didn't play enough to receive any repeat questions, but my brother has (I'm surprised he still hasn't earned a million dollars yet!)...coincidentally, I also got the ""You Don't Know Jack"" jumbo software, which I think is even more fun to play...as others have said, the questions don't repeat, and the host interacts with you a lot more...I suggest you buy that instead...overall, ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" is pretty disappointing, considering it was made by the same company who created YDKJ..."
1,Don't buy this game!,"This game plays the same questions over and over. After two games, we began getting repeats. Surely the makers of this game could have added more questions? I could have thought of more myself. I felt bad that I ordered it as a Christmas gift. THIS GAME IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Good but... NOT!,"I must say that yes, it was an OK game. I thought, ""Oh great! I liked the TV show so this must be as great as the TV show."" Let me point out the two main things that really bugged me (there are others but these were the main two): -First of all, when u are playing the fastest finger question and no one in the room gets it right, the game quits itself! Now, I cheated one time by pressing my letter everytime an answer would come up. THEY NEVER GAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER! -Second of all, if u are playing and lose all of it (meaning ur back to zero), Regis comes on and is really rude! I mean he practically insults u.Now, take my advice and the others who have bought the game, don't buy it. Buy some other trivia game, just not THIS one!"
1,Repeating questions,"I was very excited when I received this game for Christmas, but was utterly dissappointed when the questions began to repeat on the third or fourth game. The other strange thing is that the $100 and $200 questions are harder than the questions for the bigger money. I would not recommending buying this game unless you have a very short term memory.y"
2,WHO WANTS TO ANSWER THE SAME QUESTIONS!,"The first time I played, I would give the game ""4 stars,"" but as others have noted, the questions repeat too many times (regardless of whether the same person plays, or even if you play it on different days). The lifelines are not necessarily helpful, either. Regis is funny but he doesn't interact enough with you. It's still addictive, however."
1,YAWN!,As soon as the game was offered we ordered it right up and are so disappointed with it! The graphics are ok but within an hour we were millionaires! Not much of a challenge because the same questions are repeated so often!
1,Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"The game did not sucessfully install on the first attempt. Once installed it is unstable. The game is CD ROM intensive. Don't spend the money, try the second edition."
2,"2 hours of game play, a most! Sloppy production to make $$","Now I like the television show, dont get me wrong, but the gamein comparison just gets stupid. This computer game was obviously puttogether only to make more money off the sucess of the tv show. For example, the ""genius"", or should I say not so genius creaters of this game put so few questions in the game that the questions begin repeating again and again. How would someone think he is being challenged if he is getting repeat questions? Oh, he (or she) cant.Despite this atrocity (the repeating questions) I did enjoy the game for the first 2 hours. The lifelines were good. Plus, the game is made by Jellyvision, the same makers of ""You Dont Know Jack"" and the setup is quite like that series. . ."
3,This Game is Okay but just okay wait for sale,"This game isnt that bad but I have only had it for one day. It crashed first time before I even got first question, then when i finally hit the million it crashed again still saved my status but I didnt get to see my check or much fanfare. As for repetitive questions yes I got some after a few times playing, but I did get some new ones thats why I only hit the mill once. Regarding timer you can always pause and look up the answer if u memorized question. And as far as Regis being rude yes he is but it makes the game fun thats what I like about you dont know jack (another jellyvision game) dont take it so seriously people , but if you are sensitive or playing with kids then well there should be a warning I guess.I gave the game 3 stars just because I felt sorry for it. Prob would of gotten more sorry stars if it wasnt from Disney."
1,Obvious,"The show did great and so will the game. As long as there is publicity for it, people will buy it. It's the oldest thing in the book.Unfortunately I did not get the choice to rate this game lower than 1 Star. But then, that is a good thing, because my rating would probably be in the negative.I don't paricularly like the show and I most certainly would not buy the game. Unfortunately a friend bought it and I had the wonderful experience to play it. There is just one thing that top's this disgrace and that is Deerhunter or Professional Bull Rider.It is really no surprise that titles like that will take over the market. The computer business is being overrun by the everyday user who will blindly buy what is being spoon-fed in the media."
1,Very Disappointed!,After the first round or two questions begin to repeat. My 10-year old doesn't want to play anymore because of Regis' comments. I am very disappointed that Disney put their name on this product.
2,Anchor Hocking Essex cobalt 16 pc drinking glasses,"Glasses should have been listed as ""seconds"" as they are not round on the top. All have slight defects. We kept them anyway because they have become the topic of conversation at the dinner table. Walmart sells this set for $8.99, they just didn't have them in stock. Also, shipping charges were excessive."
1,Color Cartridge for HP,The HP-78 color cartridge was supposed to arrive by July 30. It is August 6th and I still have not received it yet. Should I continue to wait? I received the black cartridge two weeks ago.
3,Good review,I think this is a good review and overview of the procedures described by the various authors. In my opinion the decriptions could have been somewht more detailed into the technical aspects of executing the differing ideas and concepts and procedures.
4,cuisine skills,craig claiborne was in a select class of commentary on cooking. book was old but serviceable seller service very good.
3,Not As Advertised,These Wheelbarrow Handles were returned because they were marked as 60 inches in length -- they're only 55 inches long.These handles are TOO SHORT for a 6 cu. ft. barrow.I gave them 3 Stars because they were of only fair quality.
2,be careful of the picture,"When I ordered it a week ago I could swear it said ""handles"" plural and the picture shows 2 handles side by side. Got one handle today. Not happy but I can live with it since only one is currently rotted out."
5,Great book,"I have read all of Esmerald Santiago's books and was excited to read her latest memoir. If you have enjoyed her other books, as I have, you will enjoy this book. It is not as one dimensional as some other reviewers have mentioned. Ulvi is not the villain, but someone who entered her life for purpose. They face obstacles as all relationships do. Esmeralda mentions the nationalities/race of almost everyone she encounters, including her lover. It's not a form of racism, but of description. Read the book with an open mind and I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I have."
5,I wish there was a part 4!,"I loved reading about her life since ""When I Was A Puerto Rican"" and ""Almost a Woman"" I was hooked til the very end. Esmeralda Santiago is an amazing woman and I loved feeling like I was there throughout her journey. A must read especially if you enjoy a good story and biographies."
3,How many years does it take?,"The writing is eloquent but the relationship disturbing. This is a seemingly intelligent woman who lets herself be manipulated and controlled for 10 years by a man who doesn't really care about her....only uses her for his own personal satsfaction and gain. As women, may we all learn from her memoir."
3,Fireball 500/Thunder Alley,"Pretty Cool Car movies, Don't care for the musical numbers and certainly not a fan of Plymouths or other Mopars,but neat film.I enjoyed minus the beach party singalong stuff."
5,outstanding,I've really enjoyed these poles. The cork grip and wrist strap with thumb hole is a must have on any trekking pole.
5,Superb Performance,"I'm on my fifth season on this poles and they just keep going. They are ergonomically very comfortable, the suspension is easy on the bones, and the durability is incredible! They've taken me across muddy terrain, ice, creeks, rocks, steep inclines and descends; it's like having an extra pair of limbs. These poles inspire a lot of confidence. They don't bend or give an inch when I put all my weight(185lbs) on them. I'll be replacing them with the same model when they give out."
1,awful,"Was looking forward to this, a movie based on Jewish internees in German concentration camps who actually helped out in the crematoriums. But what a slog:1. Confusing: it's like the movie's two discs and you've just inserted the second disc.2. Horrible acting.3. No attempt at accents.4. Claustrophobic look, tight shots, etc. This, I assume, was because they didn't have much of a budget so kept the shots tight so that they wouldn't have to build expensive sets.5. No attempt at characterization.6. The film's look is too bleak, too dark throughout."
1,bound in banality - spare yourself,"This film was a gratuitous usage of ""shock and awe."" I have read widely and seen many movies dealing with the Holocaust and never have I encountered such drivel in a film. While Tim Blake Nelson may have attempted to portray disorientation and the senseless acts of violence bound within this atrocity - it ends up being a banal attempt. Extremely disappointing."
1,hollow cost,yes its a serious topic-yes it happened--yes it was horrible beyond belief-- but this movie is lets see what phrases come to mind unwatchable ...-- poorly edited poorly costumed even !!--everyone looked `dressed` even naked bodies look too arranged ! such amateurish nonsense-- again not the topic !! just this shoddy treatment of it ----nothing is believable at all-- bad acting all around-- poorly shot badly written scenes drift into meaninglesness & come and go with nothing compelling about them-- is there a plot here --or are we just supposed to be disgusted by all the goings on --look --its a movie-- it has to be entertaining or compelling or something besides ill conceived and poorly done to recommend it ! trying to sit thru this rambling idiocy is torture enough ! i`m sure the producers meant well-- but geez ! like louie b mayer said-- if u want to send a message-- call western union !! avoid this like the plague !or watch schindlers list again !
3,Whatever,"I don't know. For some reason, this film didn't ""grab"" me. It didn't really delve into the characters psyche very well. I normally love any movie about the holocaust. I wish they would release Schindler's List soon."
3,Average Nazi Flick,"Last night I watched ""The Grey Zone"" because I was looking to rent ""Conspiracy"" and just watched ""Amen"". I reccommend ""Amen"" over this movie. Harvey Kietel does a good job holding the movie together but he is not good enough to make this a great film. I found the shots rather annoying because the camera bounced around. The dialogue seemed forced because it sounded like the actors were reading directly from a script in front of them. This made the performances unconvincing. The movie did get better as it went along. They did a good job of capturing the day to day routines of a nazi death camp. It gave me some insight into the operations and enlightened me about the brave desperate people that stood up to nazi rule. Decent, could have been better. Mira Sorvino has a small, well played part."
3,athe movie was just OK;,This movie was a little bit too depictive althgough that is what did happen during the war. Some scenes could havebeen toned down a little.
4,act of life,a powerful performance of a group of actors guided by a talented director to show the real happening in the Nazi era death camp. Hopeless people who had to put their own relatives into the fire gather to save a girl who survived the gas chambers. A stunning performance of Harvey Keitel as Nazi officer. A movie with no softening of the truth close enough to the real facts as told by the survivors.
4,To important to be ignored.,"Take a brief look at the lives of some Jewish Hungarians during WW2 in Auschwitz concentration camp. I don't think any of us can even begin to imagine the hell these people went through. Watching thousands of your friends, families and neighbors being gassed to death and then loading their lifeless bodies into crematoriums until the only thing left are their ashes you are covered in. It just goes beyond anything I can fathom. These people did what they had to do to survive just one more day in the hell they were thrown into. Would I make the same choices they had? Would it be worth living one more day, doing what they had to do? I don't know, and I do not think any one of us have the right to judge their decisions. I do know this movie does an excellent job of showing how is might of been for those poor souls."
5,THE GREY ZONE,"The Grey ZoneThis is simply a excellent movie based on a broadway play i believe.I purchased after seing only part of it on a hotel cable channel one night.I actually purchased it in VHS format which was all that was available.(at that time).I AM HABIRU,so perhaps the movie holds more of a subjective effect on my religious group.But like the movie""Braveheart"" it should touch others not personally involved.But like BRAVEHEART it should have the same effect on all decent people who watch it.That is why it is an exellent movie.Strogly Reccomended.Not for the faint of heart.Not atear jerker.Just reality portrayed by the actors. MOST highly reccomended"
3,Three Rare Finds,"I bought this Time-Life disc chiefly because three of the Beavis and Butt-Head shorts--""Citizen Butt-Head"", ""The Trial"" and ""Good Credit""--are not available on The Mike Judge Collection. I just only wish there had been more of these obscure gems. The three aforementioned shorts are as good as any of the ones Mike Judge ultimately picked in his compilation; and I wish the entire series would be released on either DVD or on Amazon Instant Video. Speaking of which, when is MTV going to relaunch B&B? Here it is Fourth of July weekend already, and no sign of the duo's return..."
3,Fantastic KVM - except for the V,"Having 5 devices (2 laptops, 2 desktop PCs and a Sun workstation), I really thought that this 8 port KVM would do the trick for me as the specs promised everything I need (though not the DVI that I'd love): enough ports, USB, audio/mic, and high res video. Since I use a 24"" 1920 x 1200 monitor, the claimed 2048 x 1536 video support was especially of interest to me. Unfortunately, only 1 laptop and 1 of the PCs worked at that resolution, and the other 3 had ghosting bad enough that reading text was difficult. Even at 1600 x 1200 it was bad enough that I would not want to work on it. Other than that one significant problem, it's a wonderful KVM. The controls and build quality have a nice feel, not cheap. The feature set is all I can imagine wanting. The manual is well written. I ultimately had to return it due to the poor video quality, though."
4,IOGEAR KVM 8 puertos,"The IOGEAR MiniView 8 ports is an excellent product, met all my expectations, unfortunately, if we compare his version with Mini Synphony View 2-port, you're missing some things, like good rubber feet to prevent slipping at the product put it on your desktop, you need to have network and able to control printers and scanners through USB port. It also should include a 10/100/1000 network.For the rest it works great, it's fast, looks great, is modern and really a bargain because you get a great team.roberto m"
4,Excellent Book!,"When I began this book I was a little sceptical as to how I would like it considering there are several authors contributing. However I was pleasanly surprised at the qualtiy of it. The chapters are short enough that a busy wife and mother can still read one through in one sitting and come away enriched by it. I was encouraged, convicted and challenged by each chapter and highly recommend it."
5,Does what it says on the tin!,I really enjoyed this seminar. It's well formatted and covers the topic in depth. I feel confident that I've learned some solid entry/exit strategies and are already applying Farley's methods to my trades. Recommend!
3,Looks nice,"The flatware chest looks nice, but could be made a bit better. The drawer doesn't fit real securely. But it's fine for our use."
1,Really salty,"I should have checked the nutrition information from these. Each one has 300mg of sodium and you can taste every mg of it. They taste something like an unleavened saltine cracker, but they're saltier (which is saying something). They do pop up nicely in the microwave without the need for any frying, and if they got rid of most of the salt (or if you like lots and lots of salt) I think they would be very good."
4,What I've learned,"Sharwood Plain Poppodoms 94gThese were something new to me in my restricted diet (no gluten, dairy, soy) and I was at a loss as to how to use them, so first I just ate them out of the package,like a cracker. Then, after reading a bit here, I put them on a paper plate, brushed one side with oil, sprinkled on some cinamon sugar and then microwaved them for about 35-45 seconds on high. (Watch them to prevent burning!). A bit salty, but YUMM! (To ease saltiness a bit, I wonder if one quickly dipped them into water for a fast ""wash"" before MW? Pat dry with paper towel, brush with oil and sprinkle with Cinn/sugar???) Gotta' try that. BTW, I got these at my local coop for $3.29 per pkg."
2,not too useful,i wanted a kevlar pair of gloves or the kind that has the palm made out of kevlar these gloves are not kevlar as i know kevlar so they are totally useless i have put them in a closet to sell in a yard sale when i have the next one. amazon shame on you for offering these.
5,"""POWER IN THE BOOD"" OF WOMEN - NOT JESUS!","I read this book back in April 1996 and could not put it down! Brenda Peterson really captured my feelings of joy and frustration being a woman living in a ""dominant"" society. Born and raised in Seattle, I identified with her stories of living in the beautiful Pacific Northwest where Mother Nature seems to fill every nook and cranny. SHE is everywhere! Brenda's essay titled ""Power in the Blood"" was so eye-opening in that it shows the way fundamentalists have blindly followed a religion that has made women the cause of all the world's problems, not seeing that the true causes of starvation, warfare and cruely stem from the ancient belief that men must be in control and dominate women and nature by so-called ""divine right"". As far as I'm concerned, that kind of thinking has just got to go! Thank you, Brenda, for a truly ""truthfull"" and insightful book. Blessed Be! Love and Light to you and all who read this book."
4,"weird, but good","This was the first Kobe Abe book I've read. It a short quick read, but rather crazy. I'm not sure what really happened or why. A lot of things are so random and therefore entertaining. I would recommend this book to those who like well written books with great imagery and that are thought-provoking, but ultimately lack the usual plot structure and conclusion of a story."
5,Still Smooth,Nat King Cole is one of the Greatest Artists ever.his voice is timeless.this disc reflects His Genius as Musician&vocalist.The arrangements alone are Amazing.The title cut alone Leaves you in a Trance.
5,Superb work of scholarship and a great read,"This book must be read by anyone with an interest in Carroll. Its scholarship is superb and its case for a complete reassessment of Carroll's life, particularly his sexuality, is put so strongly as to be beyond doubt."
4,Great strategy game,"My granddaughter introduced me to this ""kids"" game and continues to beat me most of the time. I play a complex set of duplicate bridge conventions so it's not that I'm a slouch at mental games. I think this game helps kids learn mental chores and keeps us oldsters mentally alert. But it's also fun. Only problem I would have with the game is that only two can play it at a time; would be neat if a 4 person version were available. Nevertheless, I highly recommend Pecking Order for kids of all ages, even as old as me."
5,The Best Chocolate Syrup in the World,"To know Fox's U Bet is to love it!! Nowadays, you generally can only get 'Chocolate Flavored' syrup. But not this one, oh no, nothin' but the good stuff in here!! Great on ice cream, milk, and oh yeah, Egg Creams!!!"
1,fox u bet,I recently purchases fox u bet chocolate syrup.It was awesome. thamk you for prompt delivery*****
5,Taste of childhood!,An eggcream made with Fox's U-Bet...pure bliss! Nothing else even comes close. One sip and I am six years old and back in Brooklyn. Which considering I am pushing 50 and living in North Carolina is no small feat. Got me through law school!
5,The BEST chocolate syrup!,"I heard of Fox's chocolate syrup in a discussion about the best chocolate syrup. I was on a cruise and our dining companions were discussing the merits of various chocolate syrups when one of them remarked about Fox's.I told them I was partial to Bosco, the one I grew up with, but couldn't find where we live. She offered to send me a jar of Fox's when we returned to our respective homes. She sent it, I loved it and so when the jar ran out, I ordered more. Thank you!"
5,it's oneida,"45-piece stainless flatware set, service for 8, that too from oneida at $29.99 (inlcludes S&H which was free)? only amazon can make it happen. oneida, as usual, offers a lifetime warranty on this beautiful set."
2,Never received my DVDs,Ordered this in September and noted that October that the package was supposedly received by the post office but I never received the package. I have seen the show on public tv and it was great compared to the current crop of shows (90210 / One Tree Hill / Gossip Girl). Great show. I recommend it.
3,an okay game,this game for being a space game was to bad. i thought i could have been better. but oh well. i think if you like games with not so great graphics then you should get it but if you care about graphics then this isn't a game for you.
3,Not Authorized by the Band,"This is a repackage of what should have been ""Live Stupid"", a live recording made by the band to be released by SST in 1992 as part of the settlement between the label and the band over the ""U2"" release. ""Live Stupid"" was never released, and the label sat on the material until 1997 (the year ""Dispepsi"" was released). At that time, SST re-edited the master recording, dispensed with the original ""Live Stupid"" artwork (replacing it with a text-only cover) and released it in an apparent attempt to compete with ""Dispepsi"". Despite the fact that the label had the original DAT recording, it chose instead to master the CD from a hissy analogue copy. ""Live On Tour"" is not authorized by the band. In fact, Negativland responded to the SST release by sending out a press release to retailers and distributors."
4,excellent quality but made overseas,other than being not made in the United States these are excellent quality sockets for the price. Highly recommend. Thanks
2,Ugh.,I had to order this product twice. The first time Amazon shipped it 4 of my glasses arrived broken. Asked for a replacement....5 glasses were broken.Just the other day I was washing a glass out and it popped on my hand. Had to be rushed to the hospital because the laceration was so deep and big. I currently have 9 stitches. I don't feel comfortable with these glasses anymore.They were fine at first...now...I need a better thicker glass to help my worries go away.
3,Glasses not made the same,"First shipment had broken glass due to poor packing. Amazon.com replaced with no problems. Very good customer service.Sadly, I found the Anchor Hocking quality is not the same as in my older set. The glass on the 16 1/2 oz. glasses are thinner and I noticed that Anchor Hockings trademark logo on the bottom of the glasses is no long put on.This set is ""ok"" for the price, and it did replace the glasses I needed to, but like alot of things, it is just not made the way they used to be."
2,seconds,"This glassware is useable, but I would have liked to know that I was buying seconds before making the purchase. The base of 75% of them is uneven to the point that the glass appears crooked and off center. So far though, none of them have broken because of this defect, they just make me a little dizzy."
2,Not very good in terms of Quality glass.,"Upon opening package and inspecting the glasses I notice most to all of the glass bottoms have misshaped bases to them as in the bottoms were not molded to be level with an table or counter top. They ""slant"" downwards from poor manufacturing and are not flat bases. Very cheap product if you ask me. Would not recommend to anyone else interested in buying this. Better to look into somewhere else."
2,broken glasses,"The glasses are fine, except that two are broken. Please advise. Robert H Moore. There is one large and one broken. E-mail address is bobmooreusn @comcast.net."
3,Arrived on time,The glasses arrived..They are beautiful love the size color and shape but one of the 16.5 oz tumblers is broken..is my only complaint..Have written for a replacement hope it goes smoothly...
2,Cheap Cheep Cheep !,These glasses are so thin it is impossible not to break a few. They are also blown really bad ecause they are completely asymmetrical.
2,glasses,The bottom if the glass is not straight therefore the liquid is not level. In addition I could have purchased these glasses cheaper at Walmart.
5,Love Everything from Modern Basics,I gave this blanket to my brother and sister-in-law. They designed the entire nursery around it. The quality is amazing and the design is so fun and unique.
2,Colonial Bias,"Eddie Myers, the author of 'Greek Entanglement', was the commander of British operations in Greece during the Italian and Nazi occupation. He deliberately sabotaged the Greek resistance, and bears a direct responsibility for the tragic Greek civil war which followed.This book is a primary source which contains some great information such as the story of the successful dynamiting of the Gorgopotamos bridge west of Lamia by the resistance forces of ELAS and EDES in league with the British. For a few details such as this the book is useful, but anyone reading it should be aware that its general perspective was not the view of most Greeks. A different view by a greatly respected contemporary Greek military figure is 'ELAS: Greek Resistance Army' by General Stefanos Sarafis. 'The Kapetanios' by Dominique Eudes is one of the only books to cover the entire era from 1941 to 1950 from a perspective sympathetic to ELAS and its leader Aris."
3,came fast - thanks,Thanks - looked interesting and came before Christmas in plenty of time to wrap it and sneak it under the tree!
3,"About ""A Good Man in Africa""","Never read a book where I detested the main character as much as Morgan Leafy. What a jerk. Dumb, insensitiveand an awful British Foreign office employee. Imagine my surprise when I read from Amazon reader comments that it was supposed to be HUMOROUS, and Leafy was supposed to be funny. Wanted to quit on the book half-way through, but had to see how it would come out in the end. Having said all this, I must admit Mr.Boyd is a really good writer."
4,A Good Man in Africa,"This story is satisfactory, for light reading entertainment. My curiosity was piqued by the indication that our hero was an 'ordinary' sort of chap, beset with humanfoibles and, to put it mildly, wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer when it came to dealing with his superiors and others. I recommend this book.Purchased through Amazon."
1,My husband was not pleased,"A good Man in Africa came with high praise. So, it goes to show that no two people are alike. My husband became totally bored after reading dozens of pages setting the stage in great detail. His statement was, ""Get it done!"" He left the book at a doctors office. Perhaps someone else will like it."
3,British colonial administration in West Africa,"""A Good Man in Africa"" takes place in West Africa - it might very well be either Nigeria or Ghana, as the writer has resided in both these countries. The story in itself is rather trivial but nonetheless presents a picture of incompetent British administration in a former colony. The performance of the staff in the British administration in Nkongsamba does probably not differ much from what you still find with many other white experts or diplomats. The main character Morgan Leafy is able to make a mess out of most, even his own life. The problems are often triggered by a complete incompetent superior (Fanshave) as is often the case in British representations.The Africans are described rather stereotyped either as the corrupted politician Adekunle or as incompetent servants. This view on Africans could be a subject for different interpretations in itself."
5,best ever,"This is the best ever cd arragement of Handel's ""Messiah"".I have the old LP, but I have searched and listened to others over the years and none compare. This is truly the best I have ever heard. Not played so fast you feel hurried and anxious- not played so slow it drags on. Also voices sung are appropriate to the message delivered- not whimpy voices where strengh is needed and not screechy voices where soothing high notes are important. Very good. Delivery of cd was exceptional too!"
2,INEXCUSABLY LETHARGIC,"This tremendously beloved piece of music is on a healthy dose of sedative under director Walter Susskind. Really, I have no idea what happened here; the hallelujah chorus sounds like a leisurely lullaby... Tempo is way too slow throughout, and there is just no ""gusto"" that should be a part of a piece of music covering profound themes like this one does. I wanted to feel it (and tried for a very long time), but just didn't.If you are interested in picking up a copy of Messiah, skip this version and instead purchase a copy of the rendition by director John Alldis (also featuring London Philharmonic Orchestra/Choir). Alldis TOTALLY redeems the London Philharmonic and wakens this important piece of music from the dead. I highly recommend the Alldis version; highly discourage this one. The classic rendition featuring the Mormon Tabernacle Choir from the 1980s also puts this version to shame.The Messiah needs to be felt deeply, and this version just doesn't get the job done."
5,"Handel's Messiah, as always, is breathtaking",Beautiful chamber music! Gorgeous symphony! Stunning complete experience with this arrangement. It is my favorite and I'm so pleased I downloaded it.
5,Needed it to complete Christmas preparations,"Great value! made Christmas special, even though my sister in-law wondered if it was not on repeat. - Handel's Messiah is not her favorite needless to say. :)"
1,One foot?,"As someone who has spent a lot of time in Laos since 1993 and who knows most of the areas visited by the author, all I can say is that I'm not sure she was in Laos.Her opinionated style probably reflects how she related to people (locals and expats) in Laos, and it's no wonder she has such a biased view of the place. People were probably not levelling with her - or she wasn't listening.The Laos that I know, and particularly the expats whom she criticises, are not at all the way that I know them. The book isn't worth the trouble of opening the cover if you want to know about Laos. But if you want your prejudices reinforced then this is the book for you."
1,Very disappointing,"I just returned from a three week trip in Laos. Before I left I was given her book as something to read while gone.I felt disgusted and angry after reading her narrative of a country I grew to love over three weeks. As other reviewers have stated, her book was so full of unsubstantiated political rantings I had a hard time giving her any credibility as a source. It was almost impossible to enjoy her few cultural encounters and descriptions of the country because of the uneccessary commentary which accompanied it.Having been in Laos, I also noticed that many of the 'brave' and 'independent' things that she did were just plain stupid. Furthermore, although she constantly referred to her own cultural sensitivity and bemoaned the horrendous behavior of other travelers, I have to say that a good number of the things she did were in fact wrong and insensitive to Lao cultural norms."
1,Rip off,I received the cartridge that said that it would fit my printer. Once I had received it and tried to put it in my machine it was not the right cartridge. I do not know if they sent me the wrong one or not. I emailed them so hopefully I will get my money back!
2,meh,"Loved by few hated by many is one of the best albums in my collection. This one doesn't compare to it. Not very addictive. Willie D is the man no doubt, but this doesn't compare to Loved by Few,its kind of amateurish."
4,Welcome Back GT!,"GT and the Destroyers are back with their long anticipated studio release after a series of best of's, live recordings, a recent anthology and the disastrous 1999 studio release ""Half a Boy/Half a Man"". On his latest release, Thorogood opts for proven material from the legends, Hooker, Chuck Berry, Elvin Bishop and others rather take a chance on original material. In fact, there is only one Thorogood original on the disc, ""Sweet Little Lady"", which GT has worked into his recent concerts. GT does a excellent job of recreating the live feel he is associated with and, overall, the disc should go a long way towards reintroducing fans to one of the hardest working men in the rock/blues industry. Hands down the best track on the disc is ""Greedy Man"". Buy it, put it on, dance and be sure to catch him LIVE!"
2,Safe and Disappointing,"I love George Thorogood. I do not love this album.The song structures are unimaginative, the playing is paint by numbers, and the vocals are uninspired.Spend your money on one of his earlier albums."
3,Just ok,I think this movie is overrated. It was fun but I didn't care about the characters and I was ready for it to be over an hour in
1,Who Makes This?,"Wow! What a cheap toy! When taking it out of the box, the lightsabers fall apart, the arms fall off the figures, and the figures break in half. Very dissapointing. If you buy it, be very careful taking it out of the box."
5,Extraordinary journey,"This is an absolutely mind blowing experience with phenomenal audio, visuals, and narrative. I bought it just becuase I like Alex Grey's art; what I found is an extraordinary exploration and discovery of vast proportions, from the physical to the metaphysical, from the base human passions and proclivities, to the richness of creative living. It is truly a trascendent experience, which Alex guides your through."
3,Good but average,"This is a very good classic but missing one key item. Many classics refer to line numbers from some standard edition, this copy lacks those which I have found handy when discussing with others or for references. Otherwise it is a reasonable edition of a very good work at a fair price."
1,Book was not the copy displayed,I needed the exact copy as displayed in the picture. That is not what I received. No one contacted me and said they were making a substitution.
4,He's gone but not his music,"Funny how it took Robert Palmer's death on Sept. 26 to make me write a review of an album I adore. Like one of previous reviews, I got this CD when I was with a music club to replace my worn out cassettes of Heavy Nova and Riptide. Now a week after his death, listening to this album again made me realize that this album showcased his personality and his artistry. You can hear his wit in ""Change his ways""; feel his sensuality in ""Between us"" and the `soul brother' within with ""Casting a spell"" and ""Early in the morning"". This album was Robert Palmer, accessible, opened, funny and talented. It's a shame that the rest of America only think of him only for THAT video but he was much more than that. Get this album and you'll see what I mean."
2,This game is very buggy,"When it works, this game is quite enjoyable and realistic (the physics not the graphics). However, it is so buggy that I stop playing with it after a few days. For me, with Windows ME, the game freezes after every end. My friend who has the game says that it crashes his PC sometimes during the coin toss and game play. I do not mind poor graphics too much, but this game is not usable even after installing the patch from the website. Worst yet, I'm not getting any email response from CS/tech support."
2,Tales of Partying (Yawn),"I was a huge fan of Eric Burdon in the mid-1960's, and knew him to be a (sometimes) perceptive observer of the social scene and a walking encyclopedia of Blues and Jazz. Therefore this book - which consists largely of boring anecdotes of on-the-road partying - was a major disappointment.There is little here of commentary on the music of The Animals, on Burdon's musicial influences, on the inner dynamics of the band, or of the social upheavals of the 1960's. It's mostly sniggering recollections of partytime; we've all ""been there/done that,"" and don't really need to hear about it anymore."
2,Ticket to Nowhere,"What there is of it is okay. It fails to really make you think about its message and fails to have much else available, but I do like the genre and what is there is done pretty well."
5,cool,"Don't get the WB where I am at. So, this was all brand new. It was great to get this series in one big block. Same for Angel."
5,Great values in life,Everyone knows that there are bullies we have to contend with. The show helps give views on how we as individuals can take courage and be a superhero in our own right.
3,Too Villain of The Week,"As this is the first season of Smallville, it was a little duller than the subsequent seasons. While relationships were being formed and characters being explored, the show tended to become a villain of the week fest. Each week, some villain poewred by kryptonite meteor rocks tended to appear, kill people, and get defeated by the awesome Clark Kent. It got a little boring after a while, but towards the end of the season, the show became veteran enough to do more character involved plots. The first season is a little slower than the awesome seasons afterwards, but its good enough to merit the purchase."
2,Bad Quality,"When I received the DVD, it did not fit the quality that you had previously described. The whole first disk skips, and I couldn't even watch it. You should have checked the DVD before sending it. If you knew it skipped, then you lied in your product description.."
1,BS Amazon,"I watched this years ago when it first cam out and loved it.. so i decided to buy & watch it again, i bought the first season for $11.99.. and suddenly the price has tripled... You think i am going to pay over $300 to watch a series, you must be mad.. no wonder online piracy is so prevalent.. You make me sick amazon.. sell me the first season of a show for one price and then triple the price.. disgusting...i wont be buying further series at $30 odd dollars per season.. i will risk copy right infringement first..Thanks amazon...."
2,A Failed Attempt at a new,"This show is just plain bad. The characters are one dimensional, and there is no story advancement for the entire season. Every week there is a different corny villain with no motivation (or acting skills). Clark Kent looks like he is 25 years old, Lana whines a lot, and Pete Ross is annoying. The only episodes worth watching are the first and the last of the season, all the episodes in between are simply self contained wastes (and don't even contribute to the main arc). If you want to purchase a great season of T.V., buy ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" Season Two. Just avoid ""Smallville"" at all costs."
1,"""Somebody Saaave Meee..."" For 14 year old girls only.","I was an avid comic collector (and I still collect some now) and Superman has always been the most monkeyed-with character. But ""Smallville"" has gone too far.Maudlin and silly, this continuity-busting show is simply ""Dawson's Creek"" with teenage Superman thrown in + 1 black helper character (all the networks got in trouble for color-less programming so I thought that I would mention him). You can almost hear the female teeny-boppers go ""OOOOH!"" when they see Supes in his flannel shirt; too bad that he is such a TERRIBLE actor.To keep the young, male demographic interested, the show parades some 25 year old looking ""teenage"" girls around the set and has them pout their lips and whine out some insipid dialog every once in a while. Then their performance stops when Mr. Boring, the teenage Superman, starts giving the beat-down to the villian-of-the-week.Just awful."
4,And so it begins!,"And so it begins...Clark Kent, our hero...is never recognized as such. It's amazing to see how young this cast was when they began and how far they've come in their acting abilities...especially Tom Welling and Allison Mack who were together for 9 years. I like seeing these young people who, essentially become super sleuths, develop their skills. It's actually funny how they were so brave venturing out trying to figure out which freak of the week was about to destoy someone or something. It's also wonderful to see how far the story has come once Clark got out of high school. I'll always look at these early episodes with fondness even though they aren't always my favorites."
4,Very Good,"Excellent video. Cover a little worn, but in very good condition. It arrived in only a few days and I'm having a great time wathcing it. I love it!!"
5,Smallville- its about time,"What a great series, as a middle aged adult I have grown up with the Superman Legend an have enjoyed this show immensely. The writers and creators have maintained and remained true to that legend. Tom Welling is the perfect Clark Kent (Superman) and I am looking forward to future seasons (can't wait to see him fly!) as every episode tops it's predecessor."
1,Worst Series Ever...,This Series is the biggest piece of crap I have seen in a long time. They used (and ruined) the Superman story to pull of another Dawsons-Creek-Chick-Series.
5,Great Series For The Early Days Of Superman,"I found this series to be a very entertaining and enjoyable show of the early days of Clark Kent before becoming the famous Superman. I do have to say that the way they did the character of Lana Lang was a little annoying. My personal view of the shows Lana is she is superficial almost to the seventh season and I was always rooting for the character of Chloe to become Clark's true love in the show even though that never happened. I thought the actors they got for the characters of the show were well done especially for Lex Luthor,Clark Kent,Martha Kent,John Kent,Chloe Sullivan,Lois Lane,Lionel Luthor,Peter Ross,and Lana Lang. The setting they got for Smallville is also incredible it seemed exactly like the comic version of the town. So I say to all fans of Superman if you liketo see the early years of his life in Smallville this series does the jobamazingly..."
3,"Very Imaginative, pretty good actually","I found first season to be pretty good actually. The pilot episode was one of the best episodes, I especially liked the meteor shower scenes, most of them well done and the scene wher Lex's Porsche runs off the bridge sending Clark off the edge with it still looks unbelievably real to me.The casting is pretty good, some new characters introduced to the story line but all well portrayed and I even liked most of the plots. I'd read that first season was known for it's freak of the week episodes but they really aren't that bad, and some of them are even sort of creative.I just wish that Clark would finally manage to fly, it's been most of three years now and all he's managed is to levitate during a dream about Lana, and maybe fly to her rescue during the season ending tornado."
5,Absolutly AMAZING !!!,"I started to watch the series on TV and I fell in love with it. It's so great. Every kind of tv show is in smallville. Romantic,Drama, Action, Science Fiction !! everything ! It may looks expensive .. but it greatly worths it.. In my case its my first DVD set that I buy of my life and I dont regret it !!Smallville Rocks and I love it !! Cant wait for Season 2 ! i'll buy it !! Give it a try guys !!"
5,A Great Series,"Smallville really ties together the story of when Clark Kent is older. This show also has great stunts and gets you hooked right at the beginning. All of my friends I showed it to loved it and asked what happened next, of course I mean who wouldn't. Not to mention it has an incredible cast and I just adore Tom Welling."
5,I'm also wondering when the Season Two DVD is coming out!!!,"My daughter last week gave me Season One to watch. I didn't watch the show and understand it is in the Third Season. I'm hooked. After watching episode 21, I'm can't wait to see what happened. When is it coming out?"
5,Great deal at perfect price,I have to admit when I saw the outside of the box I was concerned about the condition of the CD's. They work perfectly. I want to get all ten seasons of Smallville but not break the bank doing so. Now I can and will.
2,No 5.1,"I am a fan of Superman, always have been. I havent even lost hope that Lois & Clark DVDs will be madeNow to Smallville... Great showDVDs? they are not 5.1, they are only stereoI cant believe they didnt take the time to do the proper sound for the DVDs being that the quality (except for the opening credits) is a great WS anamorphic format.R2 dvds will be 5.1. Now is that fair?"
3,"Acceptable, but not one of my my faves","I have to admit, this show is all right. I think they could have done a much, much better job with it than what they did do.Kristen Kreuk's acting is superb, but Tom Welling's seriously isn't. He's very artficial and doesn't really act. Sure, he can furrow his brow and say ""Dad, I feel so alone,"" but he doesn't portray the character of Clark Kent, i.e. Superman, well at all. He just says the line and kisses Lana and shoots fire from his eyes. Is that acting? Is that feeling the character from the soul? I think not.I also don't like it that each episode is like it's own little capsule and doesn't lead into the other episodes much. Sure, it maybe does a little, but not much and that's very unrealistic.I sometimes watch this show when it' on if I happen to see it becuase i do like everyone's acting except Tome Welling's and it is pretty intense sometimes. The plots are sometimes a bit unreal and bit forced, but it is a decent show, just not one of my faves."
3,Smallville- season 1,"This was the first time that I was not 100% satisfied with a product from Amazon. It came brand-new, and two of the discs were loose in the package. One of them was already scratched. The actual caseing had nicks in it. It was not that expensive, but it was still very upsetting."
5,Excellent,We couldnt wait for this dvd to come out! We love Smallville here in Australia. It feels great owning the complete season when suppliers here insisted that it would never be released.Thanks Amazon!!!!
5,Best show on TV !!,I didn't wanna like it. I refused to watch it. I'm in my 30's............This is the best show on T.V.Fans range from 6 to 60. Male and female.I have now seen every episode available. (Bought all 4 seasons on Amazon and will buy 5 in September.)Can't wait til' Season 6 begins.WATCH THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!It's the best show...EVER !!!!
5,Refreshing,"This is such a refreshing change of pace from other shows that are on. I love this show, I don't think there has ever been anything like it."
5,This is too cool,"I am so happy they are finnally putting this out.Oh and to the UK.I love you guys but nah nah nah nah nah nah.We got it and you don't.Its about time.You got Buffy Angel and Friends first but not this baby.Hehe.My wife likes the show but watches her teen idol stuff instead.Now she can watch it anytime.UK,I love ya babe but I have to rub it in a little.I just wish the episode Vortex was in the first season but oh well just have to wait for the next season for that.I love that two parter.Tempest and Vortex...............The Storm."
5,BEST TV Show Ever.,"I am 34 years old and all my life I have been an avid TV watcher.A lot of shows over that time I have liked, but nothing has impacted my life like Smallville.Between the chemistry of the characters, the interesting plots and the overall heart of the show, I have been hooked since the show began.I highly recommend that you buy all the seasons and watch as Tom Welling becomes the legendary Hero, that we all know and Love."
3,Smallville,Though the series does not follow the comics very closely it is a great show that tries to detail the life of Clark Kent and his struggle with becoming a superhero. A good first season to kick off the interest of superhero fans.
4,Smallville,A very nice series about young superman. The characters and the locations are very enjoyable.
5,Smallville - A History in the Making,"The season that started all. This is a great TV series to see. Prepare to watch the human side of the man of steel, his fears, his doubts, his love. Each episode will show Clark's adventures, but also how he manage to understand his new powers and to deal with a normal life. This season is full of emotions for example what i really enjoy is how Clark and Lex (future rivals in life) met and become good friends and also every time Clark try to get close to Lana and get nervous, is really to laugh.I recommend this season if you want to know better the origins of the man of steel. If you already are an Smallville fan this season must be in your collection, if you aren't, sure you will become one after see it."
5,A show for all ages,"""Smallville"" is great for adults as well as kids. It promotes family values along with lots of action. Occasionally it's scary for young children, but kids who understand that it's fantasy love it."
5,Smallville - The Complete First Season is TV at its best !,"The popular TV series on the WB channel follows the life of young Clark Kent (Played by Tom Welling) as a teenager. He discovers his amazing super-powers, grows up with the girl he has a crush on Lana Lang, and develops a friendship with a a evil genius, who will in time become the bald Lex Luthor. The Kryptonite that falls in Smallville with Clark causes some crazy things to happen, giving the young hero plenty of opportunities to save the day and one day become Superman. This is a great show that I encourage anyone to see. This set includes a 6 DVD Box set, that includes all 21 episodes, deleted scenes, season 2 sneek peek, and many other extras. I just hope they release LOIS & CLARK: The New Adventures Of Superman on DVD soon."
5,a sweet show,"I am a big fan of Smallville. This is a great show if you are an action guy, but there are some comedy, and romance. If I was you, I would get this. No question asked."
5,Great seller,My need to have a brand new DVD left when I first looked at my collection and guess what? They were ALL used DVD. What is ON them and the quality of the DVD matter more than the covers. This DVD was without scratches and that is all that matters.
4,Don't miss out on this TV series.,"I love Smallville. When I heard that the first season was coming out so soon, I knew I had to get it the first day it came out. My first expectations was that I just get just that, the whole first season. Watching it from beginning to end really makes you engulf in the whole storyline of and making you want to watch a lot more of what goes on in the town of Smallville. The dvd delivers, with all the episodes in animorphic view, which I think is great. All of the episodes are so crystal clear making it better than watching the broadcast. Sound is great too, that is if you have a great system. The extras is a little bare. Commentaries on only 2 episodes, deleted scenes on the same 2 episodes, and a mini tour around Smallville. Thats about it. A little more couldn't hurt. O'wells, maybe season 2. All in all, a great DVD compilation."
4,"Good And Bad, From Someone Who Reads The Comics","Good:- Interesting villains (especially Lex)- Interesting and well executed stories- Great special effects- Solid and believable profile of a young SupermanBad:- Kirstin Kreuk's (Lana Lang) horrendous acting. She does this weird breathy generic under acting thing that is just painful to watch- Every bad ska and ""alternative"" rock song from the radio in 2000 is featured on this show- Show can get a little too Dawson's CreekOverall, this is a great show."
5,I LOVE SMALLVILLE,"usually i would not spend money for a whole season of a show, but I think ill buy it cause im addicted to it. kristen kreuk is the coolest. azn pride all the way!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not too bad,I didn't find this book that bad as far as anthologies go. You don't get an indepth story when you read an anthology. I did enjoy that the characters were carried forward in each of the 3 stories even though written by different authors. I bought the book for the Diana Palmer story but enjoyed the 2nd story (by Ann Major) much more. It was more involved.
4,They are oven mitts.,"They are oven mitts. I don't burn my hands on my cast iron pans, so I am happy with the purchase."
2,Good Singer.......poor music,I really like the song Angel but I felt that the abulm was not that good. I may not be a music expert but some of her songs sound alike and I hope that she will make better music in the future. I feel that she has the potential and talent to make it far in the undustry but she needs to think and listen over some of the songs she makes. Sorry if I offended Amanda and anyone who felt her music was good.(remember this is my opinion and I do respect Amanda as a artist)
1,Not Good At All,"I have always enjoyed listening to Amanda, but i did not like this Cd!! All of her songs sound the same, and after a week of having the cd...i got bored! Now it is just shoved in my closet!! I am just telling you....that if i were you...i would save my money!! I like Amanda....but this is her WORST cd!!"
2,disappointed,"I wanted to hear more songs similar to the popular song ""angel"". She has soo much talent! What a pretty voice -- she just needs better songs and to pick a style. I hope for something more from this artist. The video was hot too.Try, and try again!"
1,Terrible,Her singing is terrible... I would recommend getting the album of an artist who can actually sing.
2,Hard Drawn,Very difficult to work with or form to the surface being covered. Might be fine for straight valleys but not recommended for irregular surfaces.
3,The Maury Yeston Songbook,"A good album sung by good singers. I have been an admirer of Maury Yeston for a number of years . I am a great fan of ""Nine""which I consider his best work.(If possible try to listen to theAustralian Cast Recording with John Diedrich) I enjoy listening to artists like Alice Ripley, Brent Barrett, Sutton Foster,and my very favourite singer Liz Callaway. All in all a great CD to just sit back ,relax and enjoy Les Breen"
5,Amazing!,"I bought this for the amazing Sutton Foster, who is great on this recording. However, I really love maury Yeston's music and this recording was great."
3,Three stars with an asterisk,"A very decent album with an absolutely must-have performance of a wonderful song, By the River. I have Andrea Marcovicci's version of it on December Songs (which I'd give 4 stars) but Christine Andreas takes this gorgeous song to new heights... or depths, in keeping with the subject. Her voice is pure magic and the orchestration, compelling. I simply can't get enough of it. For classical lovers, this soulful work ranks with some of the most haunting of the Song of the Auverne. Buy it now!!!!"
4,Nice calculator for the price,"This is a great little calculator. It's small, lightweight, and has a small solar cell, so it's efficiently powered. The buttons are a good size. The only problem I have with it is the plus button (which I don't use all that often for my purposes) is in the spot the equal button usually is on most calculators. I'm constantly pushing the plus button instead of the equal button because of it. It's rarely a problem and only mildly annoying, but it's something to think about if you're considering buying this model."
4,Nifty Product at a Great Price,"If you need a basic calculator at a nice price, this is it. The display is sharp. The numbers are large which contributes to readability. The buttons are also large for this size calculator making data entry a breeze. This vendor provided fast/accurate service and I would do business with it again and recommend it to others. Happy calculating!"
3,It's Small!,"Be aware - the size of this calculator is 4 1/8"" x 2 3/8"" - it's not as large as they say in the description. I was disappointed as I was trying to replace a lost calculator of a larger size. 5 Stars for how it works - 1 star for size problem as listed on Amazon. Hence 3 stars!"
5,Good little calculator,"I wanted a smallish calculator to keep by the sofa to have handy, but didn't want too small that it was clumsy to use. This little calculator is great, has all the standard functions and a good size clear screen. To top it off, it's solar powered--love it."
3,Good value for price but a little small and flimsy,"Does the job but not terribly sturdy and a bit on the small side. But for the price, it's still a solid value."
5,The Essential Satchmo,"Starting with ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" and finishing with ""When The Saints Go Marchin' In,"" this collection makes me wish I'd been around 60 or 70 years ago to hear this man. His rendition of ""Black and Blue"" reflects the pain of man who just wanted to be accepted as a man, but once the music stopped was seen only as a black man.I can remember watching Armstrong on TV as a kid, but by then the energy was on the wane and the voice was fading. I'd pretty much forgotten about him, but recently I got lucky and caught some of PBS's wonderful series on Armstrong and wanted to hear more. Faced with a choice of nearly 300 CDs, I chose this one and I doubt I could have made a better choice. I will be back for more.If anyone wants to recommend some future Armstrong selections, I'm all ears. One thing: Amazon lists this CD as ""Vol 1-3 Great Louis Armstrong,"" but the CD itelf is titled ""The Great Louis Armstrong: 2 CDs"" and the CDs are Vol I and Vol II. Not sure where Vol. 3 went."
2,"They fit thick men hands only, too huge!!","The martial quality is very good, but they are huge and I don't feel comfortable wearing them when holding something, it feels that the dishware will slip from it."
3,They do the job,"For very hot items, I find I need to be quick as I can feel things starting to get too hot. I've never been burnt using these mits, but wouldn't risk just holding on to a hot item for as long as I could."
4,A little long but great mitt,"Love this mitt. Great heat protection for broiler items. It is long, so I have to role my sleeves up but it's a great replacement for my old ratty mitt that burned through."
3,Okay,"Wish they came all the way up to my elbows for more protection, but better than what I've been using."
4,Fine Product,"The product is as described. It's a bit ugly, but does the job. You do feel some warmth when holding something extremly hot for awhile."
2,Not as described,"These mitts did not come close to the description. Used them one time with an pot coming out of a 325 oven, and my hand got very hot just transferring the pot to the counter. I am returning these."
3,Not bad but not great either,"I used these for a lot of Easter cooking. Oven was at 375 degrees. The mitts were ""okay."" My hands didn't get burnt but I also did not want to hold onto the cookware any longer than necessary. The heat radiated right through these big ol' mitts."
4,Very good product - No more burnt fingers with this oven mitt pair,These mitts actually replaced a 25 year old pair that had long past their day but I had to finally part with them after one too many crispy fingers ( there were holes in my old pair - but good quality / low cost replacements were a task to locate ). These mitts are of a great quality in that they protect my fingers/hands/arms from the heat of the stovetop and most important the oven. Nice snug fit for the entire family. Dad (me) uses them most often. Doing great after several weeks of usage. Excellent buy if you ask me. Didn't rate a five star because they get a bit warm after a few minutes of holding a HOT cast iron pot. Notice I said warm - as I challenged these mitts to make sure they could be trusted with my daughters hands. They more than passed my testing. Make that a four and a half rating if you would. The other half star deduction is due to Amazon taking so long to offer the quality/price ratio I was looking for.lol
4,Good value considering price,"Good potholders. Quite large and works well for people with big hands/arms. Go nearly up to my elbow, so nice coverage. Slightly stiff of course, but seem to be made well and I think they'll hold up to normal wear and tear."
5,oven mitts,"I received the oven mitts before estimated time date. I am very pleased with these mitts. They come up my arm high enough, so when I have to reach into my oven my arm is covered enough to protect it. I would buy from this seller again. Bonnie"
1,Died after three years...,This was an okay tv in its day. It cost $2 grand new back at the start of 2006. It suffered from motion blur and only had one HDMI port but my biggest gripe is that it last only 34 months before the picture died completely. There was sound so I was stuck with a 40 inch Korean radio.Any repair on an LCD is prohibitively expensive so you better make sure you are getting a workhorse when you buy.The LCD repair business is a really shady affair too. I don't care what anyone says: if you buy online you have zero comeback. Purchase from a bricks and mortar place where at least there is some tie to you and the retailer that sold you the thing.Here's my advice after my current experience: AVOID SAMSUNG AT ALL COSTS. Go for Sony for LCD and Panasonic Viera for Plasma.
2,14 Months of Ownership and Nothing but Problems,"The picture on this TV is OK. I would highly recommend the Sharp Aquos 1080p series instead - it is 100 times better. If you insist on purchasing a Samsung, buy an extended warranty. This TV started giving me intermittent problems at only 6 months old. The picture kept shutting off. After being in the repair shop for two months, it has returned home and less than 24 hours later - same problem. Samsung replaced the entire main circuit board. It took 2 months for the repair facility just to get warranty approval and the part, and now either the new circuit board is bad or the problem was elsewhere. Buy a Sharp instead - you will be glad you did! And don't forget the extended warranty. Even though I was opposed to them, it pays off with LCD TVs since the cost is about $600 or more to repair (I have been through this twice with two different brands of LCDs)."
1,Returned it..,poor picture quality and bad motion blurring. after 10 days start making noise (huming).SO I had to return this TV after 2 WEEK
1,Very difficult read...,Not at all an easy book to read. Hard to follow the dialect between pages. Plot was simple with main characters too many other things happen in this book to enjoy reading it.I don't like to give books bad reviews because no two people likes to read the same things but this was just not enjoyable for me. Not work the $4.05.
5,Vintage Earl Klugh,"I first heard Earl Klugh when he was the opening act for Bob James at the Lansing (Michigan) Civic Center in 1978. Although I didn't know of him at the time, I was immediately captivated by his talent. Unfortunately, a large number of his albums (back in the days when vinyl was king) released after this simply don't have the emotion that this CD has. A stellar ensemble of musicians was gathered in the studio for recording this CD in the mid '70s, including Steve Gadd, Will Lee, Louis Johnson, David Grusin etc. Patti Austin and Vivian Cherry are the vocalists on Living Inside Your Love. The first three tracks are fusion at its best. The balance of the tracks are more mellow, but have a geat sense of emotion, and are testament to Earl's tremendous talent. Other Earl Klugh CD I enjoy is Finger Paintings, which was recorded shortly after this one."
5,Important book for every call center,"Unfortanetly this book is only available in german language. It is a good and easy to read guide, who to implement active selling and outbound calls in your call center or service center. It was helpful for us in our callcenter. A lot of checklists and examples are included.There is a second endition on the run. Greatwork"
4,Only Time Will Tell,"I bought this tube for our son's 20""x 2.1 bike tire.So far,so good as they say.The tube is very thick and seems to be constructed well.The tube installed quickly without any problems and fit perfect.We hope that those pesty thorns wont be an issue any more.Our son has been happy to be ridding his bike,it's been two weeks so far without any problems.I gave it a 4 star because the real teste is time.I will give updates to the tubes durability.This tube is at a value price."
5,Tough Tube,"It is a good tube, tough the proper type valve. I have no way to know how long it will last nor how tough it will be in practice but it seems sturdy and well constructed so should have a long life. the rubber is supple and i wasnt worried about it tearing on installation went right in and blew up to higher than i wanted so when i took the valve off from the pump it was at its proper pressure.not much else to say about an inner tube at this point though it was still fresh rubber, no cracks or anything like that from sitting on a shelf for a couple of years, so that was ok but that is a dealer review not the product. i guess if it had been on a shelf for a couple of years and looked as good as this rubber was then I could say it was a very good product quality."
4,not bad for the price,Has a unusual odor. Doesn't expand and have the flexibility like ones I've gotten from Walgreens but not bad for the price. It does the job of warming my feet on cold winter nights and doesn't leak.
3,Old fashion water bottle,"works fine. no leaks so far. It has a pretty strong rubber smell which doesn't bother me too much, but hubby complains about it smelling like tire. The smell gets on your hands when you carry the water bottle around."
3,Quite Entertaining,"A perfectly adequate choppy-choppy movie with some outstanding stuntwork, primarily of the jumping off buildings, shimmying down drainpipes, and leaping through windows variety. The fight scenes are fairly stereotypical, it is the foot-chase scenes that make the movie."
3,District 13 (Blu-ray),"An average movie. Parts of the physical action scenes were quite entertaining and some good humour, but large sections of the movie were relatively stiff, some-what contrived & predictable. Certainly not as cutting edge as what you would expect when seeing Luc Besson's name attached to it."
5,"Superb action, and a sufficiently new plot for the modern believer of Civil Disobedience.","An unsuspecting (or not so) good guy, a hard boiled cop, a crime boss, and a bomb counting down from 24 hours. Sounds original, right? Well, District B13 contains enough amazing action (more flight than fight) and a cleverly dealt twist to leave grinning those with political or physical freedom at heart.Those interested in parkour may compare this film with Casino Royale. This film is much more the standard bearer for parkour than Casino Royale, as it uses many traceurs in many scenes, rather than one in one.I will absolutely see this film again. Absolutely."
4,Good action adventure movie,"I enjoyed this film. It is not of the quality of a Hollywood mega blockbuster, but the storyline is believable and action is good. You are pretty happy at the end when the 'bad guys' (one of the plot twists) finally get their due.Because of the way the movie ends, it is a good opening for a sequel.I give 4 and not 5 stars because there are a few non block buster moments."
4,Great movie,"This movie is a must, very fast paced movie! Not for kids thought. If you like the movies Crank and Crank2 then you wont be disappointed."
4,Fun action fluff from Luc Besson.,Breezy action from the man who brought us THE FIFTH ELEMENT. The leads are appealing and the stunts are great.
1,OVER HYPED + AMATEURISH ACTING + BELOW-PAR PLOT = Not worth buying.,"I rented this movie after reading many praises for the stunts. It's called ""parkour"". It's a kind of free style jumping over any obstacles such as walls, fences, stones, etc. Yes, they look good but after 30 minutes of seeing the same stuff again and again, it's boring. Jackie Chan's stunts are different and much more engaging.The main problem of this movie is the acting. It's amateurish. For example, when a guy hit another person, I can see it's obviously fake!The plot is typical of this kind of genre.No wonder this DVD did not make much money in North Ameria. It might worth watching once for curiosity."
2,Ugh,"Dumb American actions movies are not something that should be emulated. It is doubly worse when you add in European techno and rap music. The movie is too stupid for the theme it tries to take on. Somersaulting trumps guns. It is absurd, stupid, and ugly."
4,fun film,"This was an entertaining film. Special features are a waste of time, I only care to watch the film. This is a great movie and looked good on the Blu-ray."
4,"Good lord, that man just jumped off a six story building!","This is possibly the best cinematic depictions of the twin French martial arts Savate (French kung fu with straight kicks and flying knees) and Parkour (how to flip over the side of a building and survive) ever shot on digital video.It's clever they managed to create an entire dark future scenario out of the recent suburb riots in Paris last year, but it does give the whole movie a social relevance (as well as an excuse for some good angry French gangster rap in the soundtrack).If you're looking for heavyweight plot, don't bother. But anyone who would rent this movie won't be doing so for anything other than the action anyway. For that, they certainly won't be disappointed, especially during the first 5 minutes of the movie. (Not to give too much away, but that's the parkour demonstration which earned this movie international attention.)"
3,BETTER THAN JAMES BOND CASINO ROYALE,"GREAT ACTION MOVIE, similiar to Jackie Chan and Jet LI; different style. It would have been better if it was American made. The dubbing was distracting and with subtitles you wouldn't be able to follow all the action! Extras- casino fight seen is no different than the one in the movie(not extended) and the spoof reel is not funny. all in all, it's a great origional action film worth watching. Also, suggest the PROTECTOR FOR THE SAME REASON."
2,English dubbing ruined it for me,"Just an overall bad dub, then again, pretty much all dub jobs on foreign films are. Takes away from what could have been a more entertaining movie."
3,Ehh,"Disc was scratched a little more than described; DVD was a great buy though, especially for a product that isn't available in a wide range of locations in the U.S."
4,"Edgy, gritty, modern action movie","If you really like parcours and your a fan of Luc Besson, you'll like this action packed, gritty, urban movie. Drugs, sex, crime, language and all that good stuff is included with a real plot and very decent acting. The actors are nobodies in the US, but are well known in France, and are the real deal -- black belts, parcours, gymnastics, etc. No stunt guys.It's fun but not really for kids under 14 in my view."
3,District B13 - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, CAspect ratio: 2.35:1MPEG-2 BD-25Running time: 1:24:34Movie size: 19,32 GBDisc size: 23,79 GBTotal bit rate: 30.46 MbpsAverage video bit rate: 20.99 MbpsDTS-HD Audio English 3018 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 3018 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1-ES / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)DTS-HD Audio French 3018 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 3018 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1-ES / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit)Dolby Digital EX Audio English 640 kbps 5.1-EX / 48 kHz / 640 kbpsDolby Digital EX Audio French 640 kbps 5.1-EX / 48 kHz / 640 kbpsSubtitles: English SDH / SpanishNumber of chapters: 16#Outtakes#Extended scenes"
3,"Good stunts, but too few","I got this movie after I heard that the stunt scenes are incredible. And they are. There's a terrific parkour demonstration that introduces one of the main characters, with him jumping off of buildings, sliding on the outside of them, etc. There's also a terrific fight scene that introduces the other main character. However, once those scenes are done, there really isn't another good scene until the fight scene at the end. So you have 3 really well-done action sequences. There are some interspersed here and there, but I would have preferred another parkour scene, maybe 2-3 little ""stunts"" also, and another fight scene or two.Obviously, the plot isn't that terrific, but you should have already known that going in. I will definitely watch it again some time, as some of these action sequences get better the third or fourth time you watch it, but I'm not itching to do so just yet."
4,HIGHLY ENTERTAINING ACTION FILM WITH INCREDIBLE STUNTS!,"I was able to record a sneak peak viewing of the sequel to this intense action film, but wanted to see the original film first. This is a very entertaining action film with some of the best stunt work I've ever seen! The story starts out in overdrive and never lets up for a second. The most incredible thing about this film is it is all done without the use of wires and CGI and truly has some heart stopping chase scenes. ""FM"". if you haven't seen this one, you need to put this at the top of your list buddy! A real treat for fans of action and marital arts films. Think 'Crank' meets 'Escape from New York"" and you have District B-13!"
2,Great Idea But Flawed Product Design,"Kelysus had a great idea of developing a free standing portable hammock. I have been looking for one for years. Unfortunately, a great idea doesn't necessary translate to great product. Although it was a cinch to set-up, I find myself sagging lower and lower within minutes, and eventually hitting the cross bar below. I only weigh about 160 lbs!!! (note: The manufacturer claimes the product is suited for individuals below 250 lbs). BUYERS BEWARE: IF YOU WEIGH OVER 100 LBS, YOU MIGHT ASK WELL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR. I ended up returning the product."
2,t read true Reviews on height and height,"I had not problem with ordering through Amazon.This would have been a great product if it had lived up to the weight description and had alot more height. I weigh 175lbs I sagged about one inch from the ground. You lay so low to the ground and when trying to get out it is swaying and you just roll out to the ground literally, with difficulty getting up alone.I didn't send it back it is very heavy.I like my camp chair with with footrest better. Not their brand."
2,Great and comfortable but NOT portable!,"Unless you're Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schwarzenager (in his Terminator days), this is not portable. It is however, comfortable and easy set up and closed up."
5,A wonderful step back to the roots of modern country music!,Gordon Terry's rich voice returns me to a time when country music was more than flash and production. He demonstrates a range of emotions within this wide range of country music. Thank you for reminding me what country music used to be. I've missed it!
3,It was land she prized most dearly....,"Only To Find That Love Made The Grass Grow Greener.Really, it was quite shocking. Wexham Farm was a discredit to the countryside and ruined the effect of Cynthia Thornbury's carefully tended land next door. it was, in short, too wild and uncivilied, as was her insufferably stubborn new neighbor, Giles Blenhurst.Drat the man! He seemed amused by her offer to purchase. Indeed, he was more than amused by this headstrong beauty hiding behind the prim and proper attire of a spinster. He was intrigued.Truth to tell, Cynthia feared she'd formed a tendre for her dashing neighbor. But her heart was prisoner of her past. Did his love hold the key?"
4,A must have for pregnant women of color,"I was extremely pleased with the book's humor and down to earth tone. I could really relate to all the advice and challenges that many other prenatal books don't talk about. I would have liked to see more detail of each trimester, what to expect, and how baby is growing etc.I give this book two thumbs up!"
4,Fun and informative read,"I didn't know what to expect from this ""manual"" but I found it to be a fun way of getting information in preparation for my first pregnancy. The author speaks just like an old girlfriend and presents a balanced view of the many scenarios an expectant mother may face. I would also recommend a more thorough ""official guide"" type book as well just to be on the safe side though."
4,Sober and Reasonable,"This sober and reasonable overview of recent psychoanalytic theory comes most alive when its author tends towards poetry. Particularly compelling are the latter chapters, which are most idiosyncratic in their exploration of inner distance. The poetry of this section, however, in no way undermines the book's utilitarian strengths."
2,Not the best value,"I should have looked closer as I thought this was the large Toblerone bars that you used to have to buy in the duty free shops while traveling. Those larger bars and this size - are both available from ""big box"" stores. The size of this bar makes it not a great value for the cost. Can secure this for MUCH less right in your local store - and even at full price locally, you can get it for less than this one cost. As for the bar itself. I have liked these for the better part of 20 years - they NEVER disappoint. Great candy... just not great value."
2,Not enough in it,"I was dissappointed in the amount of almonds and nouget in this expensive chocolate bar. I had to pay around five dollars for it which helped to get ""free"" shipping for an order. Not worth it! This same item was offered in my town for $1.00 and $1.50. However, didn't even purchase the bar at this cheap price."
5,The right way to mix it up,"Tim Bowman's ability to mix contemporary jazz with contemporary gospel is nothing less than amazing. This is a jazz cd with a taste of gospel added. While the gospel adds a dimension to the cd it does not detract from its jazz genre. If you are a true jazz fan, you will enjoy this cd. A must have.... Great job Tim on this one."
2,Substance and process,"This is an experiential tale of being the ""sorcerer's apprentice"" written in a stream of consciousness style which envelops the reader in a sense of the experience of the healing touch training."
4,Neat Stuff,"I bought this book for my inquisitive 9 year old nephew, but frankly, I was just as interested. A very nicely illustrated and descriptive book detailing just about everything and how it works. An excellent book for inquiring minds of all ages!"
5,An Exquisite Translation of a Long-Lost Treasure,"This remarkable little book, by an adept and adroit translator, is not merely a superb rendition of a beautiful, compelling poem; it is an ingeniously enlightening and entertaining look at the poet's times and the poem's context.For those interested in John's Gospel and early Christianity, this book is an invaluable resource. For those who simply love great literature, this extrordinary translation brings a true poetic gem to the modern world."
4,If I were a Cat...,"My cat loves these treats in all of the flavors, but especially the seafood medley! This has a cruchy outer coating and a soft inside. I generally give my cat 4 treats a day...and he can't wait! Just give the bag a shake, and he comes running! - of course he does that with the can opener too.1smileycat :-)"
4,"Good, but not good enough","I expected a bit more from these authors. There is a wealth of data (too much) showing the viability of this strategy. This book provides convincing evidence that covered call writing is an excellent strategy - a stratgy I discovered last year after reading THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS, which I also recommend.The short book goes deeper into the basics of options. Lehman's book is for the more advanced options student.Read both books and adopt this investment strategy. You won't be sorry (based on my profitable first year of using options)"
1,not new and not safe,"As a professional trader I am horrified when I hear ""gurus"" recommend cover call write as a way to protect one's portfolio. If I wrote a book on how you can make millions selling naked puts I'd be hung out to dry, however a covered call and naked put have IDENTICAL profit/loss graphs! Graph it out and you'll see. If you are willing to sell a naked put in a stock, then and only then, should you feel comfortable selling covered calls in one."
2,"Too superficial, I didn't learn much","Before reading this book, I already have something introductory knowledge about option from Cohen's <Options Made Easy>. I finished read this book in two days -- it's too superficial, you can go throught it very quick. Here is what I learn from the whole book.1. Covered call writing could be profitable.2. Covered call writing could be risky.3. Covered call writing need skill to choose between strike, expire, and market timing.4. Covered call writing could be adjustable (roll up, out, down, and etc.)The major problem: this book is lack of examples. It makes the book a full list of common conceptions.Sorry if I am too cynical or offensive."
2,where is the strategy?,Good introduction but very basic. Lack of any kind of strategy and strategy is everything when it comes to money. If you need just to know what covered calls are all about this is a decent book (I guess) unless you want to go to wikipedia and find the same informations condense in a page and save the cost of buying a book. Where can I find some strategies on covered calls writing?
5,If you have them you can use them,"For those 60 plus changes takeplace in your body. When thebody wants to eliminate fluids,its right now!! These are greatto have in the car, in case, youcannot find a place you have abackup."
2,My first and probably last Christine Feehan book.,"I was excited to read her books, but not anymore. Way too much stressing and angst by the heroine. I didn't enjoy the story or pace of the book because I did not like the Colby charater. She just grated on my last nerve - I would have just left her alone if I was Rafael, and he was no prince either! I just skimmed to find out what happened at the end. Don't waste your money."
4,Dark Secret,"I love Christine Feehan's ""Dark"" series, and lots of her other work as well. Dark Secret was a good book, but not at the top of my favorites list."
2,DARK SECRET,"Ms. Feehan has dropped the ball on this one. I have read all of her books and this one was a total disappointment. Rafael may have loved Colby but I could not tell. The impression I got was that he was God and what he said was law. I did not like the way Colby was treated by Rafael. Her conversion took forever and when it happened Rafael did not seem to understand what was going on. It seemed strange that when a Carpathian is hurt that everyone comes together to help. However, the Carpathian men or either to proud or stupit to ask about the experiences other Carpathian men have had with their lifemates. Rafael may have had his feeling returned to him but he did not know how to share OR CARE about Colby feelings. The next book cannot be worse than this one I hope."
5,WHAT A BOOK!,"Finally!!! I was able read the book in one night mind you!!!! This book differs from her others. In other words, the final battle scene between Rafael and the vampire was so different from the other battles. It surprised me to see how it almost ended. Another aspect I enjoyed was how Colby integrated herself in the battles which is somewhat uncommon in Christine's other novels. This book is a must read! I can't wait to read her other upcoming novels."
2,A mixed bag,"It must be hard to come up with fresh ideas for plots and interesting characters for a series we have all grown to love. However, Dark Secret misses the mark. It was like getting mixed messages... is the hero worth loving? Is the heroine not quite human?The best in the Dark series were those that dealt with growing as a person/Carpathian. My favorite was Dark Desire (Jacques and Shea) in a truly moving story of sacrifice and devotion. Bringing in characters from previous books was like meeting old friends. Dark Fire was another good one with a spunky heroine and a Carpathian male who didn't know quite how to handle her.I would hate to see the Carparthian stories end, but surely plots could revolve around more true-to-life lives. I'd like to see a book without an evil vampire lurking. Real life is scary enough.Having said all the above, I hope the Dark series continue, if only to touch base with Jacques, Gregori, Darius, Lucien, and all the rest."
2,Too Long,"Maybe I missed something, but this is the worst book in the whole series as far as I'm concerned and if any of the others focuses on Nicholas, I'm thinking the heroine needs more of a sense of humor and self than Colby.This book went on and on and on, just using mundane filler. The male was abusive, Colby was a dunce. The battle scene was weak although after the scene finally almost made up for having to waddle through this."
1,RAPE IS NOT SEXY!,"Feehan has been skirting the line between hot dominance games and rape for years with her Carpathian series, and in this book, she just wipes that line out completely. Disgusting. I've been loyal to this series since the first book (in spite of the same storyline and characters being recycled over and over again with slightly different details), but I'm finished after this.There is a rush of great new vamp writers out there (Sherrilyn Kenyon, for example). Try any one of them before reading this bodice ripper trash. It's embarassing to the paranormal genre and a sad statement about our culture that rape is considered an acceptable form of 'romantic' expression."
3,i need a heroine,"please! this could have been such a wonderful story. god save us from colby! She is the worse heroine that ms. feehan has ever given us. in dark magic, savannah came around quickly when faced with the realities of life. not so with colby. even when nicholas tells her BLUNTLY about rafael, explains the facts of carpathian life BLUNTLY to her, she still almost kills rafael AGAIN. some of the other reviews call rafael a darker hero. not so. i'd happily be his lifemate. he was so giving to colby. so loving to her. so very, very patient. she on the other hand was selfish and a bitch. i hope ms. feehan can make the rest of her heroines more likable. i almost didn't finish the book i got so fed up with her. colby is the reason for the 3 stars. get rid of her and it's a 5 star book. THERE IS NO RAPE IN THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Dragged On,This story recycled the same theme over and over and over. Female: You can't have me. Male: Yes I can. This one was torturous to get through and I usually burn through her books.
4,very strong lead male,very sexual content. It is a good book and I look forward to seeing more of these brothers and their stories and how they will fit in that w/ the other Carpathians because of their strong views on woman.
1,Don't Waste your Money !!!!,"Wow, very disappointed to say the least. Who wants to fall in love with someone who rapes them? Had a hard time finishing this one."
4,Dark Secret,"All of Christine's heros are commanding men, but this is by far her harshest. Close to turning vampire, Raphael is a disturbing character. It is an entertaining read and develops the series plot well. However, it may come as a surprise to those not used to the series. As the book progresses and Raphael becomes used to his emotions again, the relationship developes and becomes more of the usual romance. A wonderful read, it truly whet's ones's interest in the next book of the series."
2,A Few Comments...,"""No"" still means ""no"" regardless-hero was too dominating and heroine was too dumb. The storyline just drags on and on and rushes through conclusion at the end. She even gave the vampire more power than the hero. Apparently Ms. Feehan has decided to change this series to horror instead of romance. I'm disappointed too and hope the author will go back and read Dark Magic in order to get this series back on track."
1,REALLY disappointing!!!,"I will admit that this is my first ""Dark"" read. I love the ""Drake Sisters"" books and thought to give this one a try. I have to admit I was really disappointed (and kind of disgusted). I understood the need to bond (that the Carpathian males have) but there was no real love between the two characters; only lust. Even that was kind of.. well, sick. He bands her to him against her will, not thinking of her but of himself completely disregards her no's, then tells her that he loves her. She fights him throughout the entire book (even going so far as to call him a rapist the first time they are together), then when he is dying decides ""oh, wait! He can't die, I love him!"" Don't get me wrong the ""love"" scenes are VERY hot, but that is all it is. You feel her love and determination for her siblings, but for him all there is is obsessive lust. I'm not going to give up on the series, I just hope that the others are better than this one."
2,Disappointing,This book was not as good as Christine Feehans others. The plot was very disappointing.
2,Let me save you some money,"All of Christine Feehan's Dark series are basically the same. You have one guy who is a Carpathian which is basically a vampire but not a vampire.Then you have you have the woman who is usually a human with physic abilities or in one case another Carpathian who basically is supposedly an independent, strong woman who will not have her life ran by a man. However in the end the male always over powers the female and the female finds she can't live without him.You take an arrogant, self-centered Carpathian vampire but not a vampire male, add in a bunch of magic that can solve any problem they may have including getting the girl.Add this together with several pages dragged out sex scenes that 2 out of 3 times are in a cave and you basically have a Dark Series book."
3,Enjoyable but not earth shattering,"I did like the book, but I did not think there was a whole lot of romance. However, there was a lot of sex scenes, but without the romance, that just does not work real well for me. Colby was frightened and usure of her feelings throughout the whole book. I was okay with Rafeal's dominant character, but I wish he would have let her decide whether she loved him before he started to turn her. I realize that he needed his lifemate, but I think it would have been more romantic if he would have let her fall in love with him first, and then let her made the decision to be turned. The book kept me interested, and I plan to read more of her books."
2,Not her worst,"This wasn't the worst of the series, but it wasn't the best either. The heroine was annoying and the first half of the book was very repetitive. I found myself skimming through some of her exchanges with Rafael, blah, blah, blah, same old discussion in a bunch of different ways. The second half of the book was much better in that we got to some action with the vampire hunting. That part of the book was like the old Feehan. Ms. Feehan's use of one word in a foreign language over and over takes away from the book also. How many times can you use the word familia? And if you are going to use a foreign language, why just use a couple of words? I found it to be just as annoying in Lair of the Lion with the Italian words she used over and over."
1,Rape and compulsion not love...,"I have read every Christine Feehan book. I am not sure I will ever read another after this book. It was offensive.Rafael threatens her if she doesn't become his lifemate. He uses ""compulsion"" to force her to have sex with him, and he is no better than an animal, and a monster. I wanted to write a letter and complain to the publisher about this novel. Rafael's characater may have loved her, but should a woman return those affections just because he loves her so much? No. What about stalkers? Should women fall in love with stalkers for the same reasons? The stalker thinks he loves her? No. This was not a romance novel. This was sick. It was filled with threats, forced sexual encounters, violence and hatred. The mysterious thread at the end did nothing to make up for the rest.Christine Feehan has created a fascinating world. Too bad she ruins it. Horrid book, horrid romance genre novel especially. This should have been a horror novel."
1,Is Rafael a Carpathian?,"I'm a little confused by the name Rafael De La Cruz. Isn't he Carpathian? Why does he have a Spanish name? As for the story itself, I was very disappointed by the hero who was overbearing and arrogant. I was unable to finish the book."
4,A good entry (better than last 2),"I almost stopped reading the Carpathian series due to the annoying last two books. The last decent entry was Dark Symphony. I barely got through Dark Guardian and Dark Legend. This book is interesting, the sex is hot and the family dynamics intriguing. The main problem is the refusal of Colby (heroine) to admit that there is a problem and of Rafael (hero) is entirely too dominant. I love dominant men (in print), but he's almost abusive. He takes away ALL choices and then claims it's because he loves her. Real love doesn't deny choices. The entry of a new story line of vampire enemies is also incredibly annoying. Every other entry insists that vampires can't work together, now they're planning a grand conspiracy? Please! I think that this book would have been better if he had just taken the family back to the Rain Forest in the beginning."
2,Steer Clear of the Canon Brand Filters - No Coatings!,"Chances are 99% that you have a decent lens with lots of anti-reflective coatings on it (even if you don't know it). All of the good quality filters also have these coatings. I was shocked to find that the Canon brand filters do not have any coatings. I was using this with my EF-S 17-85mm IS, and was getting reflections (green or hazy brown spots), vignetting, and also a noticeable reduction in light transmission and sharpness. Do a test - take 2 identical pictures with and without the filter - you'll see it. Spend the little extra cash on a better filter (e.g., Hoya, Tiffen)."
4,Lens Protection,I don't really notice a difference in my pictures but this is a good layer of protection for your lenses. I don't leave home without it.
4,A pleasant respite,"For those who simply enjoy spending time gaining a glimpse at the lives and lifestyles of people within Germany and the upper crust around the world which you simply will not see in the American press, I recommend Bunte. It is more than a bit weak in politics and business but even these areas are addressed enough to keep that audience appeased on a day in the sun or an evening on the couch."
2,Works fine when computer recognizes it on startup,Only problem is I have to re-start once or twice--sometimes even three times--before computer will recognize keyboard and mouse. There is no support (driver download or other assistance) available for it on Samsung Pleomax web site.
1,All form no function,"First impression: Very thin and stylish. Wireless is convenient. When I synced the keyboard and mouse with the base I thought the build quality was a little flimsy, but hey, no big deal.After I started using this keyboard, every few hours or so I'd be typing a line of text and it would disappear. It was like a ghost was pressing the delete key. This was a little annoying but the keyboard was cool enough, no big deal.Then the keyboard just stopped working altogether. I tried to resync it with the base. I tried new batteries. The power light refused to come on. Dead keyboard. Kind of a big deal.Normally I'd chalk this up to bad luck, but given the build quality, I can't recommend this product."
3,OK but not stellar,"I am an avid fan of biography, and I found this one to be OK. It was certainly informative, but there was little information here that can't be found in David McCullough's book on Abigail's husband John. Abigail is a true heroine of American history, and certainly deserves her own study, I just wish there was a bit more here. In McCullough's book both John and Abigail are so well drawn that it basically leaves this work as a side note. Pick this one up if you just want more on this dynamic, rare political woman who was opinionated and at the same time develop a true partnership with her husband."
2,Too bad,"This review pertains to the Amazon Instant version:As some reviewers already stated this movie is cut. Some further research shows that, unfortunately, there isn't a complete cut out there. This film was released in different versions for different countries. That said, this cut seems to skip plot points, and it also seems to be the shortest all together. This DVD features an 86 minute cut. IMDB lists the original US cut as 105 minutes long, whereas the Italian cut featured 120 minutes. This is a fun movie, but the missing parts are obvious.Also note the image format is actually in the correct 2.35:1 ratio, but it's not 16:9 enhanced, so the image shows up as a smaller box on HD televisions."
3,I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE TITLE.............,"FIRST AND FORMOST, I LOVE THE MANY FORMS AND STYLES OF THE BLUES. THAT SAID, I THINK THERE ARE SOME BLUES BANDS THAT ARE GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. EXAMPLE, THIS BAND COMPARED TO THE FABULOUS THUNDERBIRDS. THE T-BIRDS KICK BUTT EVEN ON THEIR "" TUFF ENUFF ""1985 DVD. THE BLUES COMPANY NEVER SEEM TO GET OUT OF SECOND GEAR. PLUS ALL THE TALKING IS IN GERMAN. GREAT FOR GERMANS, NOT SO GREAT FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T SPEAK GERMAN. THE VOCALS ARE IN ENGLISH WHICH CONFUSES THE VIEWER EVEN MORE. THE GUITARIST IS VERY GOOD BUT NOT TOO INSPIRING. OVERALL THIS IS A GOOD DVD BUT NOT SOMETHING I WILL KEEP IN MY COLLECTION........."
2,Cute house but too small,This is a cute house but small. Really too small for the critters. It is even too small to put too much matching furniture in. I bought a few room sets to put in the house and they don't fit because of the size of the house. My daughter plays with the critters but not the house. Too pricey too for what is consists of. There are better products out there that cost less. I also purchased the matching table to set the house on. The table is used a lot.
5,great resource,Great companion to Integrative Behavioral Couples Therapy book. Would really like to get the IBCT book electronically as well though.
1,"""Flanger"" sound from early digital restoration","The main question you have to ask when buying a CD of a legend such as Carlos Gardel is what kind of an engineering job was done on transferring the 78rpm recordings. In many ways, this CD has the best sound of any Carlos Gardel I've heard. But it seems to have a fatal flaw of many digital restorations from this period --- a ""flanger"" distortion of the high frequencies that sounds like you are cupping your ear now and then. Something in the music actuates the flange when it occurs. A shame."
5,Great Entertainment,"Item was sent in good time and excellent condition.I highly recommend the entire 15 seasons to anyone who has the least interest in cars.Some episodes are so funny, others so amazing, and yet others show you how these threepresenters deserve the respect for their knowledge, commradity, and driving ability.And tune in to BBC America next fall for Season 16, live."
3,Only 6 Episodes and No Extras,"Americans who buy the entire ""season"" of Top Gear need to be warned that, in typical BBC series fashion, their ""season"" has only a fourth of the episodes that we're used to. Why this is troubling isn't the content or the show itself, which is bloody brilliant. Even someone like me, who isn't a gear-head and can't tell an Italian sports car from a Ford Focus, can love this show and the three guys with their boyish antics. I can't get enough of it. But with a season of only 6 episodes and absolutely no other extras at all, I can't justify the price (although this season just had its price lowered by Amazon--some of the other seasons are still priced at $30, or $5 per episode. That's why I only gave it 3 stars--the show deserves 5 stars, but the price should have gotten zero."
4,Just as good as the last one,Wow - another good one by Bertrice Small. My only comment is that it's too bad she can't bring back Skye and more of her adventures. Those were by far the BEST! Keep those good story lines coming and I will keep reading them.
4,one of my favorite books,"i loved this book.i was a little wary of purchasing it after realizing there was a book before it,but i didnt let that stop me,and am i ever glad i did buy it!the story moves from England,during the commonwealth,to France,and then back.the whole time,you see Autumn grow and mature,although there were points wher i thought she could have been more mature and made better desicions.but thats what i like about Bertrice Smalls charaters,they make desicions and have to live with thwm.the ending was good too,what a twist!i recommend this to anyone who loves Bertrices books!"
1,Small Has Turned A Corner,"This book was a whole lot of nothing. It starts out depressing as the main characters whine and wail their way through Commonwealth England. When so many deaths occur at the outset of a book, you're probably going to wonder what's romantic about it. Well, nothing. Autumn Leslie is either devoid of personality, or she's prancing around sleeping with the kings of France and England. She never seems to be having fun, either. Jasmine Leslie seems to have tried so hard to be her grandmother that she has no personality of her own. Ugh. I'm glad I got this from the library instead of buying it!"
5,I really loved the author and this book.,I chose this rating because I happen to really like the author and how she keeps me interested in reading the books. Yes I would recommend this author to every one. The title is Intrigued
5,Great Book!,As usual Bertrice Small captivates her audience with great detail and little known historical facts she paints a picture in your mind and brings you into the heart of the story. I loved it!
5,This is the best Betrice Small book since Wild Jasmine !,"This book captures the wonderful Betrice Small spirit that was so prevalent in her earlier books, but so lacking in her last couple of efforts. I was greatly disappointed in her novella in the ""Fascinated"" collection of short stories. However, Ms. Small is back in force with all the passion, tragedy and joy of some of her best novels.""Intrigued"" is the kind of book that one needs to have an entire weekend to savor. Curl up with it, make a hot cup of tea and enjoy being swept up in the story !Despite a poor review below from a sour grapes reader who clearly doesn't like the genre, I hope other Betrice Small fans will read this book and savor it."
4,"Almost, but not quite good.","Readers of the Skye O'Malley series will enjoy this book, for no other reason than it continues the story of her family along.There is not much else to recommend it. It is like going to afamily reunion...you enjoy seeing everyone and hearing howthey are doing, but in the end you are glad when it is over."
2,Rather Boring,"I've always enjoyed the majority of Bertrice Small's books and in fact have read every one of them. But this one was rather boring. The heroine, Autumn, never went anywhere exciting or got involved in anything dangerous. She never went to harems or did anything outlandish. As a descendant of Skye O'Malley all the fire and bravery of her great grandmother was not there. The storyline was boring. I was disappointed."
3,Quality or Quantity,"Dear Mrs. Small- I started reading your books from a hospital bed and have loved all of the characters you've created. I even plan to name my own daughter Skye. But this last book was so white-washed. Characters that I looked forward to reading about, I suddenly found so boring and predictable. Have you ever considered writing one of the O'Malley stories from a man's point of view. How even a man can be objectified by a Queen. Think about it. All in all, I remain your loyal reader. Even your worst effort is better than some-others best work."
4,Toilet seat covers,"The shape of the cover doesn't exactly match the toilet seat, but I think all covers are the same shape."
1,"Cheap, cheap...cheap.",Go for the better quality. These are too cheap and I'm sorry I took the cheap route. I haven't even bothered to put these in service. They fall apart just by looking at them.
1,Crap!,This seat cover is crap! The paper falls apart and if there is any moisture on your skin it sticks to you and The paper disintegrates. It is next to impossible to get it off your skin.
5,"A very refreshing game, straight forward goals, loads of fun","This game was a very refreshing alternative to most games I've played lately. There were no difficult learning curves to learn, I was competitive the minute I started the game. And I liked the quick turn around with the different events also. I can't wait to have my buddies over this weekend so I can crush them in the Tire Toss event. Also the graphics really rocked, and the price was within my budget."
2,Boring.,"This book was boring, filled with long lists of names and places but little to hold my attention. I found ""Rothstein"" a chore to read."
4,Great,"I loved reading this book. It took me about 3 days to read. The only time my attention span went low was during the court hearings. Other than that, it was great."
1,Not The World Series,"This is about wide-spread corruption in every facet of early 20th century NY City, and only peripherally about the 1919 World Series. Too many details about wretched people with awful nicknames. Too hard to follow, jumps all over the map chronologically, paints shallow pictures of people, and is far too long. NOT RECOMMENDED"
4,Very thorough review of Arnold Rothstein's Empire,I've been fascinated by Arnold Rothstein for many years. I wish there were more books out there about people like him who were so influential in the 1900's to 1920's. This book was a great read but I wish there were more information about his childhood and his relationships with Lucky Lucciano and Meyer Lansky.Rothstein was truly one-of-a kind and there aren't anymore like him today.
1,Must have been in a hurry,"There are a ton of facts and figures and alot of supposition in this book. That stuff is then just loaded in a shotgun and shot into a book. Really bad. Given the same amount of research and material, a better writer could organize this material and edit about a quarter of it out and make something enjoyable. This is a jumbled up mess."
3,Instructif,"Un voyage bien documente dans les ""roaring 20's"". Et des personnages "" larger then life"".Un livre bien écrit, recommandé."
5,Dear Kilroy - Thank You!!,"DEAR KILROY is about making connections in life that are meaningful and lasting. I found myself melting in my chair as I read it. I could not put it down. In a compelling and heartfelt way, it reminds us what we need to do-laugh more, love more, live more. The stories shared are personal; they provide relevant life lessons learned from canine companions-touching and heartwarming. For seven years I was a mental health therapist and I wish I had this book to give to my clients. It is a self-help book in the truest sense."
5,A Book to Touch Your Heart,"I have just finished reading Dear Kilroy. From the first few words, I knew that I didn't want this book to end. I was totally immersed in every page. Harrison's ability to put emotions into such descriptive language left me yearning to cuddle my own dogs. It's beautifully written with equally expressive photos. I can't remember a book that has touched my heart in such a meaningful way as Dear Kilroy."
2,hmm,Taste like sugar and I suspect its just a placebo but maybe it will help trick my mind to think it really works. The pic shows 250 pills but I only got 120 (not that it works anyways but yeah) The pills take me about 10 minutes to disolve under my tounge but I will continue to take till I run out. I suffer from anxiety that makes it hard to drive and go to stores and what not and I will keep looking for an over the counter helper.
3,Clever lyrics let down by tunelessness,"The album opens with Key To Her Ferrari, a jazzy, orchestral piece with spoken vocal parts. Airhead is a mid-tempo ballad with some pop appeal and Hot Sauce falls within the same style, somewhat tepid although the arrangement is complex and interesting. Pulp Culture is an exemplar of the the lack of melodicism that makes this album lukewarm in comparison to his better work. The slowly lilting love song My Brain Is Like A Sieve is mildly appealing, as is the atmospheric The Ability To Swing. Budapest By Blimp is another slow ballad with atmospheric vocals and evocative instrumentation. Overall the album is disappointing, lacking the catchy hooks and quirky charms of Dolby's best tracks like Hyperactive and She Blinded Me With Science. I recommendThe Best of Thomas Dolby: Retrospectaclefor the most enduring work of this talented musician."
2,Definitely Not His Best,"I love Thomas Dolby. I consider him a genius. I have all of his albums. But this album, frankly, is a major disappointment. It is his worst. Although there are a couple of good songs on it, and although us die-hard fans will certainly want it, I cannot recommend it to anyone else. It seems as though, on this album, he was pandering to an audience that was unable to appreciate his earlier brilliant work, a bit of a musical sell-out."
5,Pure Genius,"What can I say? Wow- this album is by far the best Dolby has produced to date. It is not a wallpaper album. This CD is a journey. It has so many part's to extract, but is fun too. The music is simply phenomenal. Open guitar chords, haunting piano lines, danceable (though I dont know why anyone would want to compare him to George Clinton?!) beats. I espically love it when he slows things down and takes us through ""Pulp Culture"" (one of the best slide-solo's I have heard) and the sweet-reggae style ""My Brain is Like a Sieve"" and moves us to ""Budapest By Blimp"", the rockenist most errie and wonderul song on the album. Album's do not get any better than this. I have had it since it came out in 1988 and I still find something new, and something delicious about it every time. If you are considering buying it, you won't be dissapointed."
3,"Be advised, the product specifications and description are not accurate","Be advised, the product specifications and description are not accurate.This seems like a fine doorstop, but it is much smaller than I was lead to believe from the description, and it won't work for me. My hardware store didn't have any floor doorstops, so I saw this on Amazon and bought it. It isn't tall enough, so the door just swings over it and doesn't hit it.If your door bottom is only 3/4"" or less off the floor, where you plan on having this doorstop, then it is probably fine for you (take into account if you have carpet that will compress).In three places, the description says 1 1/2"" for this. It measures 1 1/16"" high, so that gives you really a max. of 3/4"" gap for this to be usable.Also, the product dimensions are way off.16 OuncesLength: 3.80 inchesWidth: 3.42 inchesHeight: 3.19 inchesThe item weighs 0.9 oz. and is only 1 1/16"" high."
2,A little too old fashioned,I had hoped to send my nephew (who is an avid reader)this book for Christmas. I was hoping to find a bit more classic shorts - And ended up getting Dickens Christmas Carol instead. I plan to send this book back.
3,"They are ok, but could do better.","The drivers on these headphones actually put out decent quality sound for the price, however, they just do not compare with the sound quality of similarly priced koss portable headphones (ie, ksc-50, ktx-pro, ksc-55). One of the major problems with these headphones is that the angle of the speakers is a little awkward and they don't really fit snugly on the ears so much of the sound is lost. If the headband kept the drivers snug to the ear these would be considerably better, but still not as good as the ktx-pro."
3,More musty than classic,"I like mid-century pop and my 2 1/2 year old son loves trains so getting this CD was a no brainer right? The problem isn't the age or low fidelity of these tunes but their awkward, C-side, lack of musicality. The lone gem is Tootle the Cross-Country Engine, a Stephen Sondheim-esque theatrical narrative that mixes songs with dialogue. But my son refuses to listen to this CD despite my best attempts to spin it into his consciousness by playing it in the car. And for some reason he finds the Tootle song ""sad"" and when he listens to it he starts to cry."
3,Less Than Best,"This CD contains 10 of Lightfoot's earliest songs from the first four albums which he recorded for United Artists between 1966 and 1968, and they are all fine songs. However, for a couple of dollars LESS you can buy ""The United Artists Collection"" which contains ALL of Lightfoot's songs from those first four albums. That would be 49 songs on two CDs -- 39 songs more than on this one, short CD -- and HOURS of great entertainment. Check out ""The United Artists Collection."" You won't be disappointed!"
3,Color not as pictured,"In the picture online, this polish looks like a pretty lavendar gray color. I just received it in the mail today and it doesn't look anything like the picture. What arrived is a dark pink kind of bronzey color. I'm disappointed and may not order online again but will wait until I see it in person at a store."
5,French Manicure,I discovered this polish Easter 2006. I received a million compliments when I used it as a french manicure. Try it painted at the tips with a silver glitter polish to outline the bottom and you'll also receive lots of comments.
3,ok,I thought the color would of been more matte vs. shiny as was the one at the salon when I first saw the color. Wondering why there would be a difference if its the same company.
1,poor quality,We couldn't wait for this purchase and it was a big disappointment. I don't think this lasted for more than a day. It didn't work well and broke immediately. I would not recommend this product.
1,broke within days of buying,Cheaply made. Not good when multiple kids are playing with it. Does not stay together well.
3,Hey. It beats eggs.,"So it's fair for the price. It's one of the cheapest, and the beaters occasionally jam. it's also not very ergonomically designed, the beater process is at a strange angle from the handle, making high-speed beating really tiring on the hands. Still, I don't make meringues daily, and for a simple omelet or pancakes it's functional.Shipping was very fast."
3,"GC Tools and Gadgets Egg Beater, Plastic Frame",It jams and stops a lot when I'm using it. I found one in the dollar store that does just as good a job. Be careful when you are cleaning this egg beater. The blades are sharp.
2,one was broken and not in new packaging,"One was broken and was not in new packaging as noted. Glad they were so cheap, we bought them for a school project and they didn't last."
1,sharp as heck!,"Junk that can be dangerous.If I'm whipping pudding or whipped cream, I like to scrape the accumulation from the beaters back into the bowl. The space to do so is too small to use an implement, and each time (being more careful than the previous time) I have sliced up my fingers quite well and deep. That makes it chintzy and dangerous in my book. I have to give it a star to get this review uploaded, otherwise......the makers (or Amazon) should pay for all the band-aids I've used. Finally just threw it away."
3,"Show is fine, note the rental terms!","The show is fine, but note that you are only purchasing a 24 hour rental, not permanent watching rights as with other shows! Screw that! So glad I did not buy all 3 seasons."
2,VAPID,"This is tiresome, and certainly not funny. It was disturbing to see all the positive reviews- is this really what people enjoy filling their minds and time with ? Cereal, grocery shopping, predictable family fueds, and a guy bed hopping in his own ""three homes"" (Oh I doubt they are really all that randy) I found it a bit sickening."
1,Typical Soap Opera,"This is just as idiotic as any typical idiotic Soap. The only difference is that the polygamy is acceptable (in their religious beliefs) while among other religions it's not, but in most Soaps it just goes on anyway. Unfortunately the result of such beliefs is incestuous relationships which lead to unhealthy children."
1,Did not recieve product. Very dissappointed,"I'm very dissappointed, as I didn't receive the product. Right now, I'm in the process of getting my money back. Hopefully, I will....."
1,This place called Salt Lake is frightening!,"I actually live in Salt Lake City, and HBO's fictionalized version of Salt Lake, is nothing like the actuall city. True the Mormon Church is very dominant in the state of Utah ( but are not all weird freaks like this show wants you to think), however Salt Lake Valley is less than 40% Mormon, that's right the majority of the valley is not even Mormon, oh and on top of that, I am yet to meet even 1 fundamentalist Moromom ( Or any one who has more than one wife). As far as I know, most of Fundamentalist Mormons do not even live in Utah."
2,Downloaded video was horrible,"The downloaded video from Amazon Unbox was terrible. It looked like the aspect ratio was all wrong, and the bottom of the picture was cut off, regardless of the window size or aspect ratio. There appeared to be no application setting that would allow me to adjust. Screen is 1200x800, and NetFlix looks great, as does video from other sites.This is the last time that I use Amazon for material that I can get from NetFlix or other sources. Sorry Amazon.I also dislike that that so-called video credit that you gave me didn't apply to this episode. Feels like bait and switch if the whole catalog is not available."
5,Groundbreaking!,"I watched every season of this series on HBO; although the rental terms here are ridiculous I think that will ease up after the series end this spring. As to the show it has been a joy to get to see this ensemble cast go to it with subject matter I'd never thought about. It even makes me want to see a little of UTAH! Bill Paxton, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloe Sevigny and Ginnifer Goodwin have made me watch intensely, laugh some, and think about this thing we call family. What a joy to see Amanda Seyfried introduced to the world audience; she is a jewel and I hope for many more good projects from her. The rest of the cast were a delight to see; some very familiar faces such as Bruce Dern and Harry Dean Stanton, some are new but all in all it has been a great 5 seasons, which I will miss!See this Tom Hanks co-exec. production and Rodrigo Garcia pilot (of In Treatment) : it's a juicy fantasy delight that's real in so many ways!"
5,;0),good series. Bill Paxton is good in this series as well as the wives. i watch it for entertainment so don't really care who lives the lifestyle. Basically its a polygamy husband balancing his 3 wives and kids.
5,God help us!,"There's an old song by the McGuire sisters from way back in the 50's. It's called ""Sisters,"" and the lyric goes something like this:""Sisters, sisters -- there were never such devoted sisters!God help the mister who comes between me and my sister.But God help the sister who comes between me and my man!""Big Love makes me recall that song, because it's really part of the family dynamic of the cast of characters. This show is totally absorbing. The writing and acting are top notch, and I watch episodes more than once because there is so much subtlety that escapes you the first time around.This is drama at its best."
4,a real good show,Big love was a Good show that HBO Brought out last year. really creative with the Lead character of Bill Paxton&His three wives. I like that element off the get go. they are all family&there are many twisted situations at work going down. the Business&the many folks trying to get in between of the family structure. it's a refreshing show&it will keep you watching. the cool thing about this show is that you can add other plots&characters&still not miss a beat because the show can only be enhanced&still keep your full undivided attention. you can't say that about many shows. the Wives all have there own vibe which makes for the shows uniqueness. you have to watch to fully understand all the roles&how everything goes down. a Really Good show.
2,A few issues,There are a few skips on the last two disks and one of the discs is not in original packaging
5,Big Love Rocks... but I am disappointed in the price...,"I absolutely loved the show. During a season where Desperate Housewives really lost alot of what made it so good the year before, I found Big Love really filling the void. Yeah, it doesnt have the action and shock of some other series, but, it is the ONLY HBO series that left me dying to see the next episode each week. I think the Sopranos is weak... I think Deadwood is boring... I liked Rome, but not enough to watch it regularly. Big Love, is character-driven first and foremost and I think that is what I love most. The only negative I see here, is the PRICE. My god, what the heck is up with the price of this set? Do they not want to sell it? It is beyond what I find acceptable, price-wise."
2,Terrible acting,Thought the line up of actresses would make the movie worth viewing. There was plenty of bad acting and bad riding. This movie did not live up the the expectation.
2,NOT ENOUGH ACTION,"THIS WAS A BUMMER. CANNOT MATCH THE FIRST MOVIE EXCELENT,(GANG OF ROSES). NOW WHEN YOU GET THIS ONE IN, THEN YOU GOT SOMETHNG. PLEASE TRY AND FIND A COPY. DISAPPOINTED!"
2,Over rated,"There were a few short stories that were compelling, but mostly nonsense. I don't think this is my genre however."
4,Good start,This is a good piece of software for the home user with a continuous internet connection. Interface could be a little more Mac-like (Aqua) but its the best out there. Especially helpful in that it monitors attempts to access your system. Updates for the virus software appear frequently (try versiontracker.com) and can be automatically downloaded. Highly recommended if you're using DSL or cable modem.
2,I was dissapointed,"The salmon and potatoes was not what I ordered. My dog was using salmon and rice from Simple and I went to Amazon, to my last order and reorder the product. What I received was the Salmon and potatoes. Since I was out of his food I did give him the new product and now he his having allergy problems again. I am dissapointed and will need to find a new food for him. He loves the taste but I would have though I would be notified that this was not the product on my products page."
3,Dog Health is Important to Our Dog VitaHound,"Our family has 2 dogs- a lab energetic and healthy named Jake, and a Terrier named VitaHound with certain health issues: VitaHound's digestive system is sensitive to typical commercial dog food. The high grain content triggers allergic symptoms and causes him to have bad dog breath.On the recommendation of friend that has tried tried several premium dog foods and determined Wellness to be a superior brand, we started to to feed VitaHound the rice and duck formula. VitaHound's bad dog breath disappeared and his allergic symptoms reduced to manageable. I believe the few extra bucks is a good investment for VitaHound's dog health."
4,"Wish they'd sell the larger size, but the product does the job","We have a big moosie of a dog that has issues with food allergies, and the one thing you don't want is a big dog with diarrhea. Nobody has fun then. This product limits the ingredients, which we have found limits our need for the carpet steamer. The dog seems to love it, but these little bags add up fast, and this stuff isn't cheap."
1,OATMEAL and Lamb,"Lamb and rice formula was awesome, used it for years without any doggy digestive problems. The photo and description on Amazon are wrong now though. Amazon is currently shipping out the new OATMEAL and Lamb formula which my dog cannot eat because of digestive issues with oatmeal."
4,Not sure if it works for allergies,"My two Shih Tzu are picky eaters. But they seem to like the Wellness foods better than any other I've tried. However, this particular variety doesn't seem to be quite as big of a hit with them as the other Wellness canned varieties we've tried. But they do eat it. As for it helping with food allergies.. and for sensitive stomachs.. I'm not so sure yet. I've been feeding it to them for several weeks now, but don't see any diference so far."
5,Great diversity of songs with this album!!,"I've read the previous review, and had to comment. I just recently procured this CD, and I'm glad the previous writer didn't burn my copy! I've listened to Gal Costa for over 20 years. This particular album shows some real depth. Granted, she shows a different singing style in some of the songs. But she has some real sassy stuff in here as well. Overall, her personality really comes out in Cabelo. Her rendition of Topazio is sung with enough longing emotion that I've played it many times just to try to understand the many emotions she put into it. Quem te viu, Quem te ve is one of the better samba introductions anyone could get! I give this album a 5 star rating overall, and would recommend it to anyone from the neophyte listener to the long-time fan of Gal!"
5,Should be on every doll collector's book shelf!,"Ursula Mertz has done it again! Her first volume of the COLLECTOR'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF AMERICAN COMPOSITION DOLLS set the standard for compo doll reference books. Now her Vol. 2 -- all new information and photos -- has been published and it more than lives up to the quality of its now out-of-print predecessor. For anyone who enjoys the composition dolls of the first half century of the 20th Century, this book is a ""must buy!"""
4,I'd call it folk music,"If you are only familiar with American Pie, and you're wondering what else Don has done, I think you'll find this album quite unlike what you're expecting. The title Love Tracks is even misleading because these songs aren't really traditional love songs. (Well, a few are.) What we do have here is a collection of 10 songs, well constructed and nicely sung. I would call this a folk album. Instrumentally, there are drums, electric and acoustic guitars, piano, bass, mandolin, dobro/steel guitars, fiddle and percussion. Don composed five of the ten songs. His lyrics are easy to understand and his voice is soothing. It's an album that gets better with each listen."
2,Deliver me from oh-so-clever writers,"If you like wisp thin plotting, facile characters and an author who plays with words rather than deeper meaning, waste your time with Adverbs. You won't remember anything except maybe the dear little title. Eileen Pierce"
2,Ew!,"I absolutely HATED this book. I recommend that if you liked Daniel Handler as Lemony Snickett, stick with his Series of Unfortunate Events! They are much better."
1,"Sadly, unfortunately, regrettably....I don't get it.","I wanted to love this. The parallel stories about different kinds of love seemed promising, as did the author's quirky write-up on the dust jacket. I just couldn't get into this. The characters were mostly pathetic, and it was hard to follow what was happening to whom because nobody had a personality. At some point, I stopped caring.It just seems like a waste. The author is obviously creative, but this is so disjointed and the characters are so flat that there's nothing for the reader to hang onto."
5,"Ok, an adverb...brilliantly","Daniel Handler is just one of the more vivid fiction writers out there. It's great to see him show his adult side with this collection of short stories which seek to explore his forays outside of Snicketville. I love the story where the character forces himself on the cabbie. Read this one by the pool this weekend. I'd love to see him write a non-Lemony novel, too."
4,"if you love words, and interesting insights on love, this is it","this book is not so much one large story as 16 short stories that are loosely related to each other but do not have to be taken as such. the writing itself is superb, phrases and lines that are memorable and expertly written.each story is a different take and spin on love, like 17 different facets of the same diamond. different looks, different takes, some rather familiar, on love. there is some great insight, and at the very least, the book is damn entertaining.i would give the book a 4.5 stars if i could. the only drawback to the book, if it is a drawback, is...it is ""too rich with vocabulary."" like a decadent choclate cake, the book is wonderful but can get to be ""too much"" after a while.buy the book, read a story now, a story later, take ""small bites"" and really savor each bit. well worth it."
3,Adverbs Review,"Along with many of the others that have reviewed this novel, this book is a bit of a struggle to get through. In the begining you really need to just stick with it and some of the connections throughout the story will start to piece together. Many of these chapters I found myself having to re read out of confusion, whether it was the mere situation or whether or not characters in different chapters with the same names were indeed the same people. However all and all after getting through it I did enjoy the book. Daniel Handler has a smirky sense of humor that underlies all of these small, rather obscure love stories. Some of the stories get very dark and complicated, while other are more or less simple. Overall I would recommend this book and believe it is worth the read."
3,"Clever grammar, uneven storytelling","Grammar-lovers will like following the tongue-twisting, innovative uses of language that Mr. Handler is capable of. There are lots of gems of self-reference. The story, however, while clever at times, is also difficult to adore. I recommend this book for the language, but not for the story. Maybe the latter will grow on me."
2,Disappointed,"I love Daniel Handler. His two books (aside from Unfortunate Events) ""Watch Your Mouth"" and ""The Basic Eight"" are impossible to put down and brilliantly constructed. This I did not see, however, with ""Adverbs"".""Adverbs"", to me, is all over the place. First it's in Seattle, then New York, with all these different people, and I feel like I'm reading the journal of a lunatic more than a piece of work done by Handler. I believe he is a genius and one of the most talented modern-day authors, but he really let me down with this book. Try as I might to understand/get into the story, I failed to. I just hope he whips out something just as brilliant as ""The Basic Eight"" again soon so I can forget about his faux pas of a novel."
1,"Buy Daniel Handler books, just not this one","Sorry Daniel Handler. As much as I love Why We Broke Up and The Basic Eight, this book was a confusing dud. I had to give up on it a third of the way through because I was so confused. And I didn't remotely get how it was a book about love, except when you told me it was."
1,Review Reflects Amazon's Inability to List Correctly,"Amazon has once again managed to screw up. The only thing this recording has in common with Ustvolskaya/Malov is that it's a Megadisc release (Megadisc is a Belgian label specializing in contemporary classical repertoire). The Megadisc Ustvolskaya/Malov collaborations consist of seven recordings, all of which except the first--An Introduction to Galina Ustvolskaya--are in print and available as of this writing.I'm not familiar with Quincunx itself and so am unable to comment on it. I'm also disinclined to report the error to Amazon as I'm really tired of doing their work for them, only to have one of their harebrained lackeys (and I suspect, given their names, that this particular division of Amazon isn't on the North American continent) respond that somehow, Amazon's error in fact meets their guidelines."
1,Horrible!,"Item arrived damaged, and was so poorly packed. This item would have been used for Thanksgiving dinner. What a disappoitment."
4,nice but not big enough :(,i just got this friday and baked a cake tonight...a 3 layer cake with the basic 9 inch cake pans..the stand itself is great but the dome just barely fits around the cake....ill use the stand but honestly i might as well throw the dome away my frosting got stuck to it
5,Beutifull Bargain,"Just received mine... and I absolutely love it. Haven't used it yet, but it is beutifull, would make a great countertop or table display with a cake, pie, or pastry in it. I was afraid because it looked to small to fit standard size cakes online, but it is large enough. Trust me you will not find a better cake plate for the price. Could'nt be happier."
5,Perfect Fit,this is just what I was looking 4 and more. A cake plate that doubles as a punch bowl. Serves its purpose....Cool
1,Don't Buy,"I bought this and it arrived broken into pieces. It's beautiful and reasonably priced, however,the packaging was horrible. I sent it back and was refunded my money. This is why I will continue to buy from Amazon.com."
5,beautiful,"it was absolutely beautiful once i opened the box. no imperfections to the glass. it came packaged with total care . I was very nervous ordering glass through an internet purchase. once the box arrived, I was very pleased! will definitely recieve future purchases from me. I would totally recomend this company to any and every woman that loves chic but classic pieces to add to their home!"
4,Cover is Heavy,Cake Set serves it's purpose but the cover is a little tooo heavy. I think a Plastic cover would better serve a person who has artheritis.
3,Heavy Cake Set,This cake plate and cover is very heavy in weight and in look. I was hoping for something with more character and more delicacy.
5,Solid and attractive,"The cake set looks just like the picture, and it has a nice heft to it. I bought it for a gift and it was well received. A great value."
5,Great Cake Stand,"I ordered three of this cake stand--one for me and two for gifts--and it is a great value for the money. It is so nice to have a covered cake stand again. This one is heavy and large, and will accommodate a nice sized cake. I had read the reviews and checked the two I gave away, but could not detect any imperfections.The only thing I'd add is that it cost me a lot to reship them. This is a heavy cake stand."
2,"Ok, but wobbles","I rarely need a cake plate, so the price of this one was attractive. Unfortunately, the plate surface on mine is not totally flat. As a result, the dome wobbles slightly. This gets very annoying when it is sitting on a table that inevitably gets jostled while people are eating. Also, when the pedestal is inverted for use as a punch bowl, the unevenness of the plate surface (now the base of punch bowl) causes the whole bowl to wobble slightly. It's functional enough that I won't bother replacing it, but I probably would not buy it again."
4,bald guyz,all of the bald guyz products have a similar design on the package. yjis was not the exact product i wanted but it will do.next time i will get the correct product.
5,Bald Guyz head wipes for a bald guy,My son-in-law must really like these sincehe always requests more. So I get them for himon every birthday and holiday.Jo
2,BORRINGG!,"I know many people enjoyed this book, but it is just not for me. I tried to read this book but never got past the third chapter! If I could, I would change many things about this book. First of all, lets get a little more action in here! I wish Kathleen Duey would start the action a little closer to the beginning of this book. It's a pain just trying to get to the good part! Also, if she really has to start the action so close to the end of the book, can't she make the beginning of this book a little more interesting? The rest of the American Diaries books are much better than this one. At least the beginning of all the other ones are interesting!"
2,Publish or perish,"Which is the presumed motive for this extended revisitation of an extensively analyzed subject. This book is bizarrely organized which somewhat masks the fact that it has almost nothing new to say. Odd comments aside (""...the casual amorality of Chandlerian violence""?!?), the text is little more than a series of introductory remarks with thumbnail bios of hardboiled writers and auteurist asides that cobble together plot summaries and allusions to the writings of other critics. Chapter 4 starts off with promise but fizzles. The extended closing comments on the French New Wave, the epilog, and the needlessly repeated selected credits are pure filler."
2,Poor Customer Service,"We had the product and really loved it for 30 days...then for no reason, (we didn't drop it or bang it) the screen got a crack in it...Since we were still under warranty called HP...sorry the screen isn't covered. They wanted 175 dollars to fix it...it then took them over a month to send the box that we were to ship it in...then because it took so long...Oooops the price for the repair went up to $199. We will never buy another HP product again..."
2,HP Support Lacking,"I bought a 4355 and the hardware seems OK, but the software, alhtough functional has some rough edges. HP support seems to end 90 days after it is shipped from HP, therefore, HP claims my software warranty ran out two weeks after I bought the 4355. They insist that it will cost $34.95 per incident of software support. A really sterling service plan, first they outsource all of their tech support to India to save money, then they charge $34.95 per incident to support the software.Chances are, I will return the device and take HP off my wish list."
3,"Good, but can do with more enhancements",I've had this PDA for 6 months and it's been very useful in most cases. My one big complaint is that you cannot use a bluetooth cordless headset to listen to mp3 music/audio. This is something HP needs to upgrade. I would rather not have to switch to a corded headset just to listen to music.
2,HP Support SUCKS!!!!!!,"I had difficulty with the wLAN aspect of the product so I called HP Support for help. Being a brand new IPAQ, I thought this would be easy. The support tech at first refused me service as they claimed that my warranty expired! As I had received the product that day, I was outraged. After complaining, they finally figured they had the wrong record.Once I got suppport, it was absolutely terrible! The automatic network indicator feature was not working properly. They had me hard reboot to connect. In addition, they suggested I do this every time I go to new hot spot. Hard reboot, erases all data and resets the iPAQ. Could not believe they even suggested this as a solution.I returned my PDA!!! Looking for a better product and service."
1,"Big, ugly, slow and bad thumb-keyboard","Let me offer some dissenting opinion on this expensive yet big and ugly and heavy pda. It comes with wi-fi, a good idea but it doesn't work most of the time, like when you a room away from your access point. The screen is small at slightly under 3.5"" diagonal, and it's NOT readable outdoors, even on an overcast day. The qvga resolution is just not enough. Get this: you don't even get a cover after paying all this money. Battery life is miserable to say the least. Thumb-type keyboard is good idea a la Clie, but poorly implemented, hard to peck on and no dedicated number keys. Also my p and z keys broke after just two weeks. Overall a very disappointing pda. I think i'm going to get a clie."
1,Extremely bad screen durability,"I have had my 4355 for about 10 months now, and in that time the screen has cracked twice. The first time, I grudgingly paid the $175 fee to replace it and figured I must have done something wrong. Two months later, it cracks again. This time I am positive there was no extreme pressure, it was never dropped.It is simply poorly designed and extremely fragile.I will say that the way I use my PDA's has not changed in a decade. This is the only one (Palm Pilot, etc) that cannot take simple every day wear and tear.HP, if this your idea of product quality and design, you should be ashamed of yourself. When people have problems with your flawed products, fix them for free.I have spent thousands over the past 2 years on HP cameras, computers, etc and this has left such a bad taste in my mouth I will never by another HP product again."
4,"Fabulous piece, slightly expensive, no Windows Mobile SE 200","I have been using my 4355 for over 2 weeks now and it has been a faithfull little PDA, juggling my Notes, Appointments, maps and directions from Mapquest - AvantGo.eMails are fun with the small keyboard attached, I'm a network freak, and even have PocketPutty installed, I have SSH and so with the Wifi network, I really dont need my Notebook at all!My music sounds okay, volume is loud enough and so is a decent mp3 player for the money, and I have discovered this box to be a great way to show off pictures that I take from the places that I visit.On the down side, the keyboard is a tad smaller than what is comfy, and I have found this PDA to be slightly heavy too. The lack of Windows Mobile SE 2003, means no landscape mode ;-(.Other than this, no gripes (as yet), I am buying a hard-case for this baby looking at others experiences with the LCD screen.All in all, a great PDA, extremely reliable."
5,Still the best business PDA,"I've had a 4355 for 4 years-and last week it was literally run over by a bus!I reviewed and tested many new PDA/Smartphone devices, but none of them were suited to my needs-easy typing, stable and usable word processing and spreadsheets, easy customization and reliability. Most of the new units sacrificed utility to include phones, games or text messaging-not what I needed.Fortunately, I was able to buy a brand new 4355 from an Amazon seller. After a week of using a borrowed late-model PDA, it was such a relief to get back to the best business tool I've used."
5,The Author is my Hero,"I just finished reading WHISPERS. I heard about the book through Lisa Haisha's monthly newsletter that I got turned on to from a friend forwarding it to me. I have never been out of the country and it is my dream. WHISPERS took me around the world and into the souls of children everywhere. It was incredible! I have to meet Lisa. I love what she is doing. This book can change lives. It has made me see the world with different glasses. And, the artwork is incredible, a definite bonus."
3,Horse Racing: Daily Racing Form- Game Review,"My wife, 3 kids and I played this game for about 15 hours finding it to be entertaining. We especially liked being able to select, develop, race, bet, and breed our horses. However, the game lacked the depth I (daddy) was looking for. I would rate it 5 stars for people aged 5-14 as my children loved playing and found it to be somewhat challenging. Perhaps, it would rate as high for older people if we raced our friends online; we have not explored this option yet."
4,Horse Racing,"I love the horse racing game, but there was a big problem. Every time the second last horse crosses the finish line everything stops ( the music stays on ). So I have to restart my computer, and if I do win the race I don't get the prize money or my bets. Please help me!"
5,Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've been saving up for this game for months and finally had enough money to buy it..... it's the best horse game ever, I think(...)HORSES RULE(...)."
1,You can never win.,"I was so excited to get this game and at first it was cool. But you can never win a lot of money. they should start you out at about a million so you can buy some good horses. What they start you out is not enough. I also wish they would tell yu about the horses entered in each race other than the win records.The horse in the lead always win if you do not have it you lose.I read where people left that they have one millions of dollars, they probably have also wrote to Penthouse Forum because i believe those stories as much as the people who have one a million or more impossible.SAVE YOUR MONEY IT SUCKS"
5,Awsome Game,This game is so cool! I love how you can race against differeent jockeys and even pick your jockey's height!!
4,Check pressure limit carefully,"Nice product, but I overlooked the fact that it comes in two sizes: 36 psi for trucks & suvs and 32 psi for cars. I ordered the 36 by mistake because it was the first one to be displayed. (I later found the correct size in my local Wal-Mart!) Other than that, nice product. Works as advertised."
2,Good idea,Really very nice secure design for securing hanging hawkweed. Design is innovative yet simple. Try them and you will like them.Appear pretty good durability. Obviously there is limit to load.
4,An excellent guide to the ladies!,"A very broad and excellent review of the female species. Written from a scientific perspective, and in depth analysis, just right for us males! If you have ever wondered why (some, or most) women will fall for the bad boys, the ones they cant have, the ones that excite and stir up desire in them, then this is the book for you! Its long, and exhaustive, and well written. Four stars for this one, but five stars for ""the mystery method"", by mystery, as it it is more concise, and has less fluff!"
1,The Science of a Sexual Predator,"This book was funny. Except I don't think it was supposed to be. It steals from many spiritual doctrines and set's out to self self serve, all while ignoring it's godly agreement. This book should be in a black-magik section. If you are a border-line sociopath, this book is for you. If you are looking for something that goes deeper, obviously you skip this book or read it like I have, in disbelief and shocked entertainment. Know your enemy. Apparently becoming a sexual predator is hip and best-selling. Enjoy your servitude."
2,thinking penis,"I wish i did not buy this book. It was written by someone who thinks with his [...]. Totally and clearly manipulative while referring to women as victims.There is no emotional dimension of love and romance and the concept of relationship seems planets away.I have the impression that, for some, the only purpose in life is to get laid."
2,The Art of Seduction,"This book is not for those who want true love in a relationship. This book is for people who want someone to THINK they are in love with them by pretending to be something they are not, then deepening the effect through pain and suffering. the book is divided into two parts. The first tells you the best way lie about yourself to other people, making them believe you are better than you actually are. The second tells you how to ""choose the right victim"", manipulate them through mixed signals, then make them believe they are not good enough for you by treating them badly.I believe seduction can be both good and bad, in my opinion this book highlights nothing but the bad. if you are a wife beater, (or husband beater) wanting to make someone your puppet, then this book is for you. if you are interested in finding love that makes both parties involved feel good, save your money."
4,Intersting.....,"The material in this book does work, but one should be careful when messing with the psyche of others. This book may tell you to be mysterious and to use deception to capture your prey, it also encourages you to be your true self. Unlike other dating books Greene, says that if you want to be bold, go right ahead and you will ""please by displeasing."" As a lady, I've read some of these books trying to understand what goes on in guys' heads. From a girls' perspective, this is a great book.[...]"
3,"Impressive writing , some harmful principles.","I followed Robert Greene the first time i found '48 Laws of Power' in the Xtian cartegory. I partly agree with the reviewer to labelled this book 'evil' .Robert Greene writes impressively and teaches practical wisdom.However when we are wise , we'll do wiser to be harmless as doves !!!I have to sit down and do some 'cracking' on his books .'Pick the polish and leave the rubbish !!!'I stand by the morally inclined to the end."
4,Great Historical Foundations,A great read! Historical backdrop of the great seducers of the world make this read much like an enjoyable novel. Teaching by example is at the heart of things but details and explanations of the why's and how's round things off nicely. Highly recommended for anybody interested in learning about and/or becoming a world class seducer.
1,ditto on the library journal review,"For years I have wondered what it is about me that makes me irresistible to men..now I know, I am the siren. Thank you, Robert Greene, for a valuable lesson in self-analysis. Other than that, this book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Overall, I feel this book is for people who feel unattractive and have low confidence. A to-do list on seduction will not make people more attractive to others. The 'techniques' suggested in this book are futile at best. If anyone wishes to create a seductive aura about them, low self esteem and manipulative tactics will surely smash all efforts. Isolating your victim? Preparing for the hunt? This book should be renamed ""How to Create a Karmic Shitstorm"""
1,Not seductive.,"This is a clever package, appearing to be both ""how-to"" and a lofty piece of research. But its either irrelevant or the worst kind of self-help book (like Learn To Speak Fluent Chinese In 10 Minutes Or Less).As with this guy's other book, there is a concious attempt to make it seem naughty by using words like ""target"" and ""victim"" but I found that just makes it more unpleasant.The only thing immoral or amoral about this is that they try to pass it off as something important. And that IS naughty."
2,The Art of Suckering,"This book has some good points, but it is serious chore to find them. It is over-written in a pompous, know-it-all style. And, worse yet, some may find his tone offensive. Making friends and influencing people would be difficult if you followed his lead and catorgized people as victums for the taking."
2,"It took 496 pages to say very little. If you want brevity, there are better options","I suppose if you have a long flight (say, 10 days long) this is a good book to have along. But if your purpose is to learn as much as possible in as little time as possible, there are many better options out there. My personal favorite in this genre isThe Zen of Meeting Women, which is both concise and practical. It will teach you all you want to know about meeting great women."
2,I didn't really like it,"It does explain some psychological tactics to make people like you, and desire more from you, but I didn't like it. I probably just suck at life, but I didn't really get anything from this book like I did from 48 Laws of Power. You may like it, this is just my opinion."
4,"smart man, uses history to point it out","this book thought me things that i always knew but wasn't about, for example the ways that i thought are the best when you have to get somebody. by reading the book ( tell you the truth i haven't even finished reading )which gives examples from history about how known figures used this techniques to seduce and conquer, it helped me to understand that all along my instincts were right about this topic. if you are trying to move you in this world then this book is a most"
3,interesting but repetitive,"It's a good read and helps understand and identify some important behavior/personality traits but gets a bit repetitive and didn't hold my interest in the 2nd half. That said, I recognised many of the 'characters' described in the book as very much alive and well and frequenting my local city. Whether they are that way from reading the book is doubtful, probably it is more based on Greene's identification of these already pre-condidioned human traits."
3,The art of seduction,"This book did introduce me to some pretty interesting concepts, but I did not like having to read all of these stories about famouse seducers befor getting to the point.You could learn somthing just by reading the keys and the interpretations in each chapter."
3,The motive matters,"I've noticed in reviews and conversations I've had with some acquaintances about this book that a number of people think the author is promoting ""slimy"" behavior. While it's true that a person could use the basic principles of seduction in amoral and unethical ways seduction at its heart is no more evil than a middle school girl's guide to being charming. The idea is to pay attention to the desires of the people around you in order to make them happy and make them want to make you happy in return. That's not so bad, is it?"
3,The Price of an Insight,"This book certainly gives a few powerful insights on social manipulation, though there are many other more authoritative works in sociology and social psychology that probe such issues much more deeply. This is not a book for those who want to understand what happens around them -- though it may give you a few illuminations -- but a handbook for those who want to profit from them. Indeed, it suggests unethical practices. But even just from reading other reviews it is quite clear that most readers do indeed consider ethics as a burden and they would rather get rid of it."
1,"Should be called ""Historical Stories of Seduction""","From all the positive reviews, I was expecting a classic masterpiece to learning the ""how-to"" skills of seduction; instead, what I got were endless historical stories of seduction in play that bored the hell out of me, and I even skipped the first 200 pages to get to the goody part of hoping to learn the practical process of seduction, and to my non-surprise, more endless stories that didn't address the old-fashion ""how-to"". I didn't learn anything from this book besides the useless insights and theories, like I really care!Frankly, this book is way overrated. For an almost 500 pages book, it could have been compressed into a 100 page practical book. This is not much of a self-help; there are better books out there and are easily applicable immediately after reading in learning seduction."
3,Uggggggh,"When i picked this book, it sounded interesting, yet a little hokey.While reading it, I couldn't help but think that other readers were musclebound, 42 year old single men, with full moustaches, that hit on every girl at a bar.I expected insight into suduction in a non sexual way as well, but felt dirty all over after reading this.If you enjoy this, other books in your library include:How to find chicks with big [...]How to make any girl screw youWhere to find the best one night standsetc.While all of thoise things are nice, they are far from high brow."
1,Lacks substance,"Pretty disapointing, I was really looking forward to listening to this audio book since I don't have much time to sit and read. I'm sure the book must be much better. This audio version was more like a quick audio summery which really isn't what I thought I was paying for. Wish I could get my money back and buy the book."
3,if you like to manipulate,"This book is written from the perspective of someone who wants to be a manipulator - intentionally. It is disappointing to see this is the perspective - instead of seduction in terms of falling in love, it is seduction in terms of mind effing people for fun and profit... yuk - sorry to see it taken to the level of such an art and essentially aggrandized, but on the other hand it provides a great warning of the strategies that manipulators will use to destroy your life. These people really do exist.The reviews written before me in this context are correct. Knowledge is power, from both sides of the coin. Buy this book if you want to protect yourself from creeps like the ones described in this book. A romantic person should be very wary of the strategies that can be used to take them for a very, very bad ride. Enlightening."
5,Insightful!,"This book met my expectations in every way. Greene explains the dynamics that all of us use to a degree, but without always realizing why. By being aware, however, the seducer can maximize what comes naturally. Greene is right that in a world where people are bombarded with messages competing for attention, it takes careful thought and planning to make yours noticeable.Greene's choice of words reflecting manipulation and power did not bother me at all. Contrary to several other reviewers who considered such language unpalatable and demeaning, I thought it to be appropriate. We all manipulate others for selfish reasons to some degree in inter-personal relationships and that is not anti-social. Insinuation works, so I think it unfair to criticize Greene for using it so effectively. Overall, I think that this book makes me more cognizant of how to use the power of persausion in all aspects of daily living."
3,Not up to the usual standards of Robert Greene,"Don't get me wrong, I'd take a bullet for Robert Greene (two actually). But this book does not begin to compare with Concise 33 Strategies of War, his best in my estimation. First, this book is too wordy, almost as if somebody else wrote it. The prose is not like that of his other books. Second, the ideas are backed up by historical examples in a manner that doesn't work unless you've got a deep background in romantic literature, particularly from the first half of 18th century France.Some people will love this book. Others, probably including those rooted in the social sciences, will find much to criticize. I don't want to discourage you from getting this book just because I didn't find value. But if you do, avoid getting the audiobook because the narrator is over the top and has the same tone throughout the book."
4,Everyone Can Learn Something From This Book,I approached this book from the perspective of a very content young wife and new mother. The obvious manipulation of people's feelings is a little overwhelming at first-but if you try to focus less of using the book as a manual and see it more as a guide to human nature and behavior-it can really teach you about all your relationships and how to increase the self esteem of everyone around you. It really explains in detail how to see people and what is missing in their lives-and in your own.I think this book is a great read if taken with a grain of salt-certainly not for the person looking to use others for their own gratification.
2,Snoozer,"Written about kings, queens, dutchesses & historical figures such as Napoleon and cleopatra. It is almost too descriptive and written with superfluous language. It was a great sleep aid!"
2,Bad Kindle Edition,"The subject mater is fascinatin but eye may not be abel two finish it. numerous speling and punktuation mistakes...Poorly formatted,Well, you get the idea. Does anyone proof-read these things?"
3,PLEASED,Nice read....Moving up in my study definitly....If your wicked then this book will be what ever you want it to be...
3,"I liked the book, hated the audio version.","The guy reading on the audio version seems to have a complete disregard to 'periods' at the end of sentences. He combines sentences and speaks without pausing. The final outcome is that it spoils the listening experience. It sounds weird.Content-wise the book is a fun read. I have definately not become manipulative, scheming, cunning etc.. I have learnt a little bit more about how people thought/think. It is definately an interesting read."
3,The alternative,"Well I been a long time reader ever since the book dropped by Mr Robert Green, to be honest an older gentleman referred me. Now Im not a bad looking guy but I wanted to know more about women dating an like any guy I want to be the ""MACK DADDY""...lol but I will say reading the art of seduction helped me to a certain degree. Look guys if you want to unleash your true confidence with any woman you have to check out Pandora's Box I ordered the product been using it, an it really gives you the guide on how to rinse and repeat your new found as I call it Mack Daddy game. I give it a 5star rating in my book best investment if your looking to storm the dating scene.[...]"
1,Margin of book glued too close,"Margin of book glued too close, I am unable to read the first words on each line unless I hold the book in the air at an angle. The ink is also very faded on the pages and it is hard to read. I am very disappointed. The book is put together very poorly."
1,From Bargain Bin To Trash Bin,"This book is garbage. Granted it does tell some interesting stories, but don't let the title fool you. THIS BOOK WILL NOT HELP YOU PICK-UP/DATE/whatever. Don't buy this book for dating tips, unless you are one of the people IN the book. If you must buy this book, it won't give you much more than a few erotic stories that try desperately to give dating advice."
1,do not get this,if you are looking for something to help you actually get dates or improve your skills with the opposite sex - this will do nothing for you at all.unless you think that going out in the our 21st with a bea brummell pompadour or cassanova cravat will help you. good luckthis cd only tells about people who lived hundreds or thousands of years ago. it is atheistic and based on the premise that there anything good is an illusion and constantly talks about your 'victim'.so if you want to try this CD serious keep in mind that you will complete possibly entertained though guaranteed to have NOTHING to show for it
3,Written seductively: Think before getting roped in,"I knew my purpose when I picked up this book. I wanted mechanisms of protection: a way to carry myself in this world so that people couldn't hurt me. But as I've made my way through the chapters, I keep asking myself what is the ultimate goal of this technique. Green's examples of seductresses end up defeated and dead, as do their prey. Many of the historical examples weren't happy people. I could see this way of living as being very superficial and conducive to paranoia. And the author agrees. He reiterates that being a seductress is about being the best actor. He does not admire moralists or authenticity. I picked up this book to avoid being a victim, but I don't see the appeal in collecting a bunch of victims, the goal of seduction. Do you?I give three stars for the unique organization and persuasive writing and research that obviously went into the book."
5,Reality Check!,"This book is absolutely fascinating! The historic relations to the content is helpful and provides even more insight throughout the chapters. The book wastes NO time with puffy sentences or grand introductions.... instead the author's every sentence has substance, and you begin to actually learn something right from the beginning. The book is a great tool to completely rebuild yourelf, as well as teaching you the 'art of seduction.' The book is intellegent and complex, yet it's written in a way that is easy to comprehend because it deals directly with its title. The book never loses the focus, and it is on point from beginning to end.The chapters/sections are just flat out amazing... it's like the proverbial 'light bulb' turning on in your head.Not only does the book support its title, but it's also a great description of the human condition in general.Very objective - Provides factual evidence - Non-biased - And downright illuminating."
4,Leopard can't change it's spots,"You will like this book if you have the patience to read 400 odd pages of fine print and you don't mind flitting from one historical episode to the next. There is no sense of continuity through the book. The author has, however done an excellent job in writing the commentary on the various historical episodes and personalities and he has drawn practical lessons from them. If however you want to read this book in order to become a hit with the ladies or hunks out there then don't waste your time. Personally I feel that it is possible for a person to polish off his rough edges. However changing a whole personality drastically is extremely difficult, if not impossible. Read with an open mind and without any ulterior motives, this is a good book. I would like to add that this book is not just about seduction in the sexual context but has got a much wider application."
4,"Machiavelli and sun tzu, on love...","According to this book, Seduction, like war, is an art that requires reflection, preparation, planning, stealth, patience, and yes: emotional detachment. This is not your regular self-help book that gives tips, advice and tactics about seduction; this is a book that helps you develop well thought strategies for seducing people, which starts with a thorough observation of your target.. depending on your ""victim"", the strategy's execution can take up to years... The work is not for the faint hearted, for it will take a lot off the spontaneity and charm which a lot of people associate with courting, and can lead to a lot of adversity (for both the seducer and the victim) when things go awry... but it is surely a good resource for people who keep on asking themselves: what went wrong, why didn't things work out with us... Although this sort of seduction is not my style, the book is quite well researched, and the best available about the subject"
1,If I have to pick a star...,"This book is unbelievable. There is not a single OUNCE of actual scientific research to back up ANY of the author's claims. ALL of the scenarios provided in the book--""victims"", seducers, instructions/""advice""--are EXTREME prototypes and NEVER actually exist in reality. Every single claim and assertion the author makes is based on fiction, mythology, fantasy, and the author's own opinion. None of it is scientific, and there is no way to weed out what may actually be accurate because the author lists no scientifically relevent sources or further readings. I am appalled at the HORRIBLE taste in which this book was written."
2,Very Lame,"I would bet that the dude who wrote this book has gotten laid very little in his life. If you just want a history lesson on seduction, this is a good book, but if you want to actually know how to meet women and get laid, this book sucks."
3,Takes one to know One,"How devilishly fun. The manipulations are mastery.I recognize a lot of stuff ""my mother told me to do"" in here, but it's dressed up in a new set of clothes. Womanly wiles mean anything to you? ""Chase until he catches you"".... ""kill him with kindness""..... ""Bait and switch"".....""Come on strong and leave them Hanging"".......""Be the last one there and the first one to leave""............ These are all ancient techniques used to manipulate people into compliance.......or, worse, codependence. So funny that we all are sucked into these things while we're young, and then we get older and the tables turn. We spend the first half of our lives buying books to learn how to get what we want by manipulation... Then we spend the next half of our life buying books to learn how to get rid of manipulative people. It's pretty funny, actually."
5,AMAZING!!!!!! POWERFUL!!! SEDUCTIVE!!!,I SEDUCED THE LAST WOMEN WHO FELL FOR ME WITHOUT THE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS BOOK... IT ONLY INCREASED/STRENGTHENED MY SKILLS/AWARENESS OF SEDUCTION.. THE WOMAN WHO FALLS FOR ME AGAIN.. LOL ... NEED I SAY ANYMORE... BUY IT...
4,ART OF SEDUCTION!!,Great read... more of text book and history than a how to but is very good info to help in dealing with people and making friends and possible relationships.Excellent seller
4,Fun!,"I think it would be a mistake to take this book too literally. Though there are some fundamental truths in the methods described, and there is no doubt that there is some amount of manipulation the game of love and romance between the sexes, this book above all, is just a bunch of indulgent, mischevious fun.The historical anecdotes may not be fully rooted in fact, but we don't pick up a book like this for a history lesson, right? It's full of the stuff of real and imagined legends, not stale facts.It's an entertaining, well-written, and even (sometimes) insightful read, and you can open up the book at just about any page and begin reading"
2,Good book but not for marketers or married people,"PROS: This book is written in the same style just like all the others, lots of historical examples. I purchased the audio book and the reading voice is excellent, one of the best voices I have heard for an audio book. I am a huge fan of Robert Greene and like all the other books,(48 laws of power, 33 strategies of war).CONS: Not for marketers or married people. I thought this book was about how to seduce prospects into buying your product - I was wrong. This book is really for single people and has various historical lessons on how to seduce the opposite/same sex. There is a part in the book about children which I found weird and quite frankly a little disturbing. As a professional marketer and married man, I only found small parts of this book useful. This book is my least favorite of the three by Robert Greene. I hope this review helps.Caine"
3,I thought there would be more to it,"I ordered this book after listening to Amanda's interview on National Public Radio. I really connected to the interview, as I have had a similar experience with my father. I thought the book would have more information with the pictures. I was a little disappointed, however I respect Amanda's work."
1,NOT A GOOD PRODUCT,this product is difficult to use. You have to hold the bottle tightly under it or ti will not penitrate the cork. I'm back to using my old cork remover. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!
1,poor design,"Not Recommended! Holding the wine bottle in place while your cork it is almost impossible. Use the ""rabbit"" or other popular corkers.....not this one."
3,Looks Better than it Works,"This thing looks very impressive and is built pretty well (except that mine has a small crack in the wood handle). However, it ain't that easy to use. As a matter of fact it takes a bit of practice to get used to. The first few bottles I did ended up shooting red wine all over my pantry. Actually ended up having to do some repainting. The secret is in the handle. Make sure you lift it all the way up, go all the way done, and all the way up again. You have to do this to make sure the threads of the screw attached to the pigtail engage. Otherwise, the thing will not twist enough. Just watch the mechanism through the slits on the side... It is also a bit difficult to hold the bottle in place while you are working the handle. I use it pretty often so have gotten used to it but, there are other simpler and just as effective tools (e.g. fork puller thingamajig) but none as impressive and gaudy looking as this monster..."
2,Nice but redundant.,"Like ""The History and Meaning of Heraldry"", this book is a partial reprint of the author's previous work, ""A Complete Book of Heraldry"". Why anyone would want to buy (or publish) two incomplete books when the complete one is already available is completely beyond me."
5,david allan coe live at billy bobs,this is the best cd that david allan coe has out out. if you liked live at the iron horse then you will like this cd. all the live at billybobs cd's are awesome i have 11 of the 16 cds...
4,Too bad its been edited down,"To correct one of the reviews, DAC talks and talks a lot, I was at Billy Bob's the night this album was recorded and was disappointed that songs where left off, which would really be my only complaint with this album."
4,Excellent portrait of an American business leader,"So much has been written about Jack Welch but this book offers a broad overview not just of him but of the company he has run for some many years. This is a solid book that offers insights into management, investment and American business."
1,where is the man?,"I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only. Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO? I wanted to know the man. What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have? How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father? How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings? What experiences in his life molded him into what he became? These and many other questions were not answered. How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes? Try it again Janet, the third time never fails."
2,Don't bother to read it,"Any book that has that many footnotes can't be good. The reader does not care if the author is completely accurate in their information, we just want to get to know the character of the book - what makes him tick, how he thinks, what are his habits, etc. In fact some of the best biographies I have read take liberties with the information to embelish the story and make it interesting. Just read some of Irving Stone's great biographies, Agony and the Ecstacy for example, to see what I mean. The author has plenty of footnotes, but no insightful information. She jumps from one topic to another, without ever giving the reader a good feel for any of the topics she covers. She would have been better off to cut the things she discussed in half and developed each idea more fully. Don't bother reading this book. Wait for Jack's own book. Hopefully we will get to know him better then.PS: At least is was better than Robert Slaters fauning accounts of GE and Welch."
2,An American Failure,"""Jack"" famusly said GE would .be a Chinese company by 2000. So what do we see now? A bankrupt companyliving off our children's future by taking handouts from the feds, in trouble with their Chinese masters. From surveying this wreckage, a study of Jack would take him as a negative example of a capitalist, one who, due to a blindness and general lackof education, went looking for gold in China, a repressive, corrupt regime. This is a great ""American?"""
1,too much,"Price is way too much, better off to just pound a nail and hang your coat on it.Cheap soft wire and just enough threads to hold it on a wall. A minimal product sold for top dollar"
1,Flimsy,"I had used this style of hook 20 years ago. They worked well and were easy to install. However this product is not as good as those bought previously. The top hook is almost straight in design so clothes, especially with a little weight, like a jacket slip right off. I definitely would not recommend this product."
2,A very poor book for teaching DirectX.,"From all appearances DirectX seems to be a extremely clumsy and tedious interface. The author works around this by wrapping all the DirectX details in his own classes. While this might be a good tactic if you are a progammer, it doesn't work when you are actually trying teach the DirectX interface. If his classes where very, very good then one might be tempted to just use them and forget about DirectX entirely. Unfortunately they are not that good."
2,"I wanted to learn DirectX, not the Jason Kolb graphical API.","I'm not sure about just what this book is trying to accomplish. The cover announces it as a guide to directX 3, however nearly the entire book deals with the author's ""wrapper classes"" with only sparse mention of actual DirectX or Direct3D functions or their theory. In addition to this, the author spread uses so many wrappers and typedefs, spread over so many files that you will find your self constanly asking, ""what the hell does 'lpDD3DTHISHEADERISWAYTOOLONG' stand for? There are much better books on DirectX out there, skip this one."
3,"It is okay for beginners, but...",This book was helpful at first but then I realized that the author was hidding DirectX in wrappers. This makes it easy to use but you don't learn the DirectX functions which is why I bought it. If I ever want to move to a newer version of DX I have to relearn everything because he teaches you how to use his wrappers and not DirectX.
2,Poor,This book explains the DirectX api poorly. Most of examples are poorly written and always put my system into a unstable state after I run them. I always end up rebooting my computer after running them
2,Poorly written and hard to follow,"This book differs discussions of the topics so often that I am never really sure if they were ever covered at all, but lets not talk about that now will cover that shortly......."
1,bad stuff,"Absolutely one of the worst programming books Ive ever seen. The code is obtuse, the comments are sparse, and the text is shallow.'nuff said."
2,Not a good book,"This was not a good book at all. The code is extremely hard to read because he puts everything in wrapper functions which are put in more wrapper functions which are put in even more wrapper functions, most of which are totally unnecessary. Throughout the book he builds on the same program, only showing you the modifications made, so you have try to remember what the previous version looked like to try and put it all together. Very confusing. Kind of a pity too because it looks like he covers alot of excellent information, it's just very hard to read his sample code. if you are a veteran windows programmer, you may be able to make some sense out of it but i recommend DirectDraw Programming by Bret Timmons although it ONLY covers DirectDraw ="
3,The recording quality is poor,"Both the selection and the mix of the disc are beautiful, it is really a gem; however the quality of the recording is very low. It is really a shame, I love this CD, but I'd prefer a better sound quality."
4,"The worst of her three novel, is still well worth reading","Although this book lacks the crispness, depth and beauty of God Stalk, it is still one of the better fantasy books I have read. Although the plot is disappointingly linear and stereotypical the characters, dialogue and descriptions make this a wonderful read."
3,worst of the series,"I read with relish the first books in this series. Unfortunately, the further into the story, the worse it got. The first book was engaging, partly because it was so naive, but by the last book it seemed the reader was having a tired plot rehashed over and over again without the benefit of gifted writing to make it bearable. I would recommend the first three books to someone wanting light fantasy, but I would leave out the last two."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Again and again and again we have a movie with the modern horror style that does nothing but bore. There are no creepy moments here. Even the decent cast couldn't save this movie.The script isn't so bad it's laughable, it's just bad. The twists are predictable, have been done before, and rather boring. Even with a few decent actors, the one-dimensional characters are not ones you care about.Stay away, rent something better. 1/10. (It was a 3/10 until the last 20 minutes or so)."
1,"horrible, simply horrible","one of the worst films i've seen in a while. full of gore, so much of it you think you might be sick. don't bother wasting your money on renting or buying this movie."
2,What an AMAZING opening!,"Seriously, the opening sequence, while kinda gory, is original and in its own morbid way, mesmerizing. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff stops, because the film then basically sails off a cliff and crashes. A shame, because you had a very decent cast that was pretty much wasted, and a screenplay that was way, way too weak, trite and predictable. The ship is an obvious cross between the Titanic and Andrea Doria, and every supernatural element is pretty much telegraphed to you before it happens. Yes, there are some decent FX, but as a whole the film just falls apart; it has no real substance and even the ""revelation"" at the end wasn't too revealing."
3,Good Way To Spend A Friday Nite...,"Although this movie wasn't really scary, it did make for a good horror movie. The special effects were pretty good (the opening scene was OUTSTANDING!!!)and the story line/acting were not as bad as some would make it out to be. The only complaint I had was that I wish more time would have been taken to explain the whole ""quota"" deal. All in all, I enjoyed the movie and look forward to viewing more films by the individuals who brought this story (and ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""Thirteen Ghosts"") to life."
2,National Lampoon's The Thirteen Ghosts Go To Sea,"True statements:1. No one forced me to watch this film.2. Ghosts like wearing 40's outfits and smoking cigarettes with long cigarette holders.3. Ghosts like making new ghosts cause they're very sociable.4. Ghosts are neatnicks. They may fill up a swimming pool with blood but are always quick and polite to completely clean up their messes afterwards with nary a drop of blood in site.5. Ghosts stare at you.6. A lot.7. Ghosts are considerate hosts. If they kill someone they wait until that person is alone so their screams of terror will not bother the other ""guests"".8. This film was silly."
3,Definitely worth a rental,"This is an entertaining movie, particularly if you're a fan of horror movies including water/boats as a thematic element. In a very broadstroke overview, a team of boat salvagers are led to salvage an otherwise illusively unmanned cruise ship...which happens to be haunted. The acting is generally pretty good, the story is acceptable, and the production values are good. In fact, the video quality is particularly good. As usual, the ending starts to meander toward absurdity, but the rest is entertaining."
4,Good suspense!,"When I first saw this one out, I wasn't sure I was going to watch it. It seemed like one of those that had been done before, if you know what I mean. Imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to find it a really great adventure! There are some nice twists in this movie that I actually didn't see coming. Great acting, too!"
2,Terrible,"This movie was so lame. Was not scary AT all, and also the ghosts were harmless. I gave it a 2 becasue the scene in the beginging was awsome, with the barbed wire. Other than that, the movie was boring and not scary at all"
3,Maybe the studio learned from their last two mistakes...!,This was better than 'House On Haunted Hill' and '13 Ghosts'!I liked it but didn't love it!What I liked about was:1. This movie (for the most part) had a plot to it!'2. Each character served a good purpose!3. The actors were good!4. The plot had some mystery to it!5. It was not as gory as the last two movies!6. I loved that song from 'Mudvayne': Not Falling!7. The ship was pretty spooky!What I didn't like was:1. The opening death scene after the opening credits wasa little over-the-top!2. Why is the little girl 'Katie's' body still there but everyother body gone?3. The pace to the movie was a bit too choppy at times!Over-all: Not a bad movie at all! Good for Halloween or anykind of horror movie fan!My grade: B- or three stars!
4,Ship Of Ghouls...,"I loved the Silver / Zemeckis / Adler HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL remake, but I thought their 13 GHOSTS reboot was sub-par. GHOST SHIP falls somewhere in between the two. While not as hilariously grisly as HOHH, SHIP makes the best of its stellar cast and amazing location, without cramming too much into its plotline or speeding things up beyond comprehension like 13G. Both Julianna Margulies and Gabriel Byrne add a bit of acting strength to the proceedings, making ridiculous situations seem believable. Gorehundts will love the opening slaughter scene! Recommended..."
4,Ghost Ship,This movie is some what scary.. I like the movie overall though. But it has a feel that it has been used before
4,A classic ghost story...,"Ghost Ship is a classic ghost story at sea, despite being a bit gory. It's got a great cast, a solid plot, and some spooky ghosts!"
3,First scene is the best,"With two exception this movie is just your standard ghost as antagonist horror flick - with some good actors thrown in. The primary exception is the opening sequence, which is one of the most gut wrenching I've seen - similar in impact to a couple of the scenes in 13 Ghosts - but on a much grander scale and with less expectation of the event. After that, it has some good twists and turns, but the story sort of slides from there. The second exception is that Gabriel Byrne is always great to watch. Overall the film is worth watching, if only for that one scene...After you've seen it, go for a cruise :)"
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great Either","Ghost ship, brings to the screen the story of a salvage crew as it stumbles across an abandoned Italian cruise ship, in the vicinity of the Bering Sea, that has gone missing since 1962.The major setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it), which is just average, while the choice for lead actress was poor at best; this film does not seem to be her thing. She is unrealistically ""tough"" and not very likable. Overall, she is not convincing in her role.Another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.Aside from that, the setting and the plot are pretty good!The film combines drama, action, and adventure making it rather enjoyable, as long as you're in that kind of a mood."
2,Grade B Horror Film's Grade: 2\5,"""Ghost Ship"" is another grade B horror film that just isn't scary. Director Steve Beck is more interested in mood and showmanship, but unfortunately, he can't even get that right despite some spooky art direction and what looks to be a pretty big budget. And this isn't the first time that Beck has told a ghost story, he directed ""Thirteen Ghosts,"" which, in my opinion, is one of the better horror films in recent history.""Ghost Ship"" could have been fun had it gone in more interesting and unpredictable directions. Instead, we're treated to a fairly dull movie experience with one dimensional characters and very few scares. And it's all capped off by a sequel-ready ending complete with an obtrusive hard rock tune that offsets any sense of terror ""Ghost Ship"" might have had to offer.In my opinion, this film should not be purchased. It is an okay rent, but make sure it a 99cent rent, as more would be a waste of your money."
3,Good intentions,"Right from the start you can see that this film had alot of potintial. For a film that had one of the greatest openings i have ever seen, and a good ending it had a very average middle. The best thing you can say about this film is that they tried. But don't get it wrong, there were those few moments of pure horror gems, in fact the idea of the film is a great idea. The thing is they didn't go in the right direction with it. Mark Hanlon and John Pogue had a wonderfull idea with this film, and you can tell that director Steve Beck tried to give us a worth while movie. Example of that is the scene were the little girl is showing our hero what happend that night on the ship when every one was murdered. That scene alone could make any viewer at least rent this film. All in all we are left wanting more, but the film tried it's best to give its all. Is it a classic...no, but is it worth your time....yes[at least once]."
3,tolerable,"This was an interesting concept, but not terribly scary or exciting. Some nice visuals-cool cover pic. Odd soundtrack though-40 year flashback with hip hop backing was a bit weird."
2,Almost Terrible,"Dull, uninspired, derivative, insipid, etc are just a few of the words that come to mind after watching this stinker. The best moment comes in first 5 mintues and goes downhill from there. The contrived ""surprise"" ending that seems to be a necessity for bad horror movies feels particularly takced on here. It's not scary, but it might have been. To its credit there a few scenes of distrubing gore but that's as far as it goes. No real suspense. It's not so bad you turn it off. I might have given it one star but I watched Darkness Falls the same night and it was worse."
3,Wonderful opening,"I loved the opening of the movie and hated the rest. It is really only deserving of 1 or 2 stars, but the opening is so original and disturbing that I gave it three. You can turn it off after that and feel better about the movie than you will if you watch it all the way through."
2,Meh,"The beginning was good, I agree, nice way to get rid of lot's of people. The cast was good as well, but the movie was not scary!... I mean come on, I was expecting a horror, and i got to see like what, 3 ghosts that looked like normal people?Oh yea and the twist in the end wasn't that shocking. Not a horrible waste of time and money, but still, I was expecting to see a horror, and what i ended up feeling was sea-sick."
2,"Entertaining, But Not Scary.","As a horror movie fan, i can spot what's gonna happen a mile away, and in this movie i knew what was gonna happen 10 min. before it was gonna happen. It's a shame too, it had a great cast of actors, too bad they were not given much to work with. I will admit though i was entertained, but in no way was i scared. What a perfect opportunity to do such a great horror film, ""on a ship"". I also will admit, i was surprised that a certain someone/something was behind the whole thing. Anyway, as i said pretty predictable, and not scary, but if one night your bored or something, pop this in, and you'll be entertained."
1,Don't bother!,"While this movie looked somewhat promising from the trailers, only the opening sequence is truly gruesome and scary. The movie falls flat, subjecting the audience to one horror cliche after another. For a classier, more original thriller, rent ""The Ring"" instead."
1,good effects awful story,Ghost ship was a film I expected a lot more out of. The opening sequence was intersting enough but the film does not live up to the expectations. I feel like the opening sequence should give you an idea of what to expect from the film not be the most interesting and gorest part of a horror film. I believe this scene was have been more appropriate for the climax of the film not a tool to get you to sit through the whole film expecting more and more and getting less and less. The acting was mediocre at best and the story had many plot holes. Don't waste your time on this dud......jery
4,Wondefully Fun B horror film,"Cheesy? Yeah. In some spots. Original? Not necessarily. Fun? Yeah! The old haunted house on a doomed and abandoned luxury liner. Some good jolts, great FX, fun music and sound. Really good for what it is. If you are looking for mindless, gory entertainment - this is a good fix. The opening: Great!!!"
2,"Boring, predictable. Some good scenes, but the rest of it..","SSSSSSSSUCKED! The first scenes were ok, and some of the hazards they met in the ship were cool, but I reeeally wish I had just gotten drunk and passed out in a park somewhere with my money instead..."
2,Oh! I'm so scared!,"Yeah right! It's funny how it says, people who rented Ghost Ship also rented The Ring and Signs. This movie bit all around. I couldn't wait until the whole thing was over so I could actually go in for work Monday morning! Scary movies are hard to come by these days....I've yet to find one that gave me the jolts like The Evil Dead or The Silence of the Lambs. Well, off to bed for some pleasant dreams..that should pretty much sum up how scary the movie was!"
2,Maybe for Halloween ...,"The scares are too few, too far between, and too often retreads.That said, there are a few good long creepy segments. I think this could be a fun rental for a Halloween party or the like."
2,Shipwreck,"Unfortunately this film never lives up to it's over the top but rather cool introduction scene.Produced by the same people who did House on Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts it continues in the same style but never reaches the creepiness and makes both these films look far superior.Tediously predictable, the plot and scripting are aweful and Gabriel Byrne's wooden seafaring acting is testing. Sure, these films succeed in their ability to scare through special effects but it also falls short in this respect too.It seesm to end too abruptly. Just as you think it's about to come to life, it winds down...possibly a blessing though.Avoid."
2,This movie will pick its audience,"I bought this movie based on the cover art and even though I read the reviews here I was hoping that I would still end up liking the film. Other reviewers have already dissected in details what they liked or not like about this film. I have to say this movie turned out to be underwhelming in acting, story and special effect.The nearest equivalent film that I can think that was opposite to this film was the Alien. It had good acting, story was similar in that main characters are trapped in an confined area and the special effect actually made me jump out of the chair (really did) the first time I saw it.This movie is okay as rental. Unfortunately, I bought mine."
1,Ghost Ship Review,"This movie is a underwhelming ride to weak plot points. The only A+ in this film is the blood & gore but most of the killings happen offscreen. The cast is so-so and so is the acting. The opening is pretty good but fails to help the film in the long run. It also has pointless jump scares. The Special effects are mediocre at best. Not to mention,the many plotholes in this film. I give Ghost Ship a 1 out of 10."
4,How Funny,"How funny. I don't think I've ever seen a film with such an even distribution of votes. I also do not understand why this movie has so many bad reviews. It's not a perfect film (not many of those), but it's really pretty darn good. It has a decent cast. It looks good. It's set in a genuinely creepy setting, It's got a good thoughtful original story. It has good scares, and it has a surprise ending.Keep in mind that Ghost Ship is definitely a film that sits snugly within the basic Horror genre. Ghost Ship (as the name inplies) is a ghost movie. There are scarier films, and there are definitely grosser films. It's not a cutting-edge, high octane, splatter film. It's not a gross-out film either. The movie will scare you, and it will put you on the edge of your seat. The best way I can define Ghost Ship is to say that it's a great horror film for a date. It's good fun. That might turn off some people, but it shouldn't. Enjoy it for what it is.3.5 Stars"
3,Middle of the road (or ocean) horror flick,"I will say right off that I am not a fan of horror movies, especially the gory kind. Which this is. But I was a captive audience and, to my surprise, it was better than I expected. The story was predictable but the film itself was fairly well done with enough horrific special special effects to please any blood thirsty adolescent movie goer. The movie reminded me a tiny bit of ""Alien"" with a strong female character surviving while the men were picked off. I hated all the male characters, so this worked well for me.The bottom line is: Do not spend a lot for this movie. Rent it or buy it cheap to watch on Halloween or when you have some friends over who are getting ready to leave for a cruise."
1,GHOST SHIP SINKS,"Terrible horror movie that is more funny than scary.When a haunted ghost ship is left in the seas a crew of people arrive on the ship some die and don't.What a waste, though better than 1999's THE HAUNTING but not that better."
1,Not Even Worth It!,"'Ghost Ship' is lacking of a good story and good actors. First of all the story is very lame, and doesn't correllate with any of the other mysterious happenings. For example the fact that the Ocean Liner shows up in the Bering Strait holds no signifigance whatsoever. Second of all, the cast really drags. It's made up of unknowns, who seem to be complete amateurs. All the parts that were supposed to scare me actually made me either mad or laugh, because it is a disgrace to any cinematographer. Ultimately, Ghost ship actually deserves -1 star but i can't do that. Don't even bother."
5,Ghost Ship,"Awesome movie. Not one scratch, could never find it in the store. So glad I got it to go with my thriller/horror collection."
1,It's a sunken ship,The title caught my imagination. I watched it the theatre with high expectation. I was disappointed after 30 minutes in to the movie. There were only a couple of scary scenes. There's no suspense. It's so bad I did not care what happened for the last 45 minutes.
1,Sucky Movie,I thought this movie sucked so bad...My fiance made me watch and I fell asleep during it...The best part was at the very beginning when everyone on the ship was killed...Don't waste the money or time...
1,1 star for the first ten Mintues...,"This movie was terrible. It was not scary at all. There was no plot to speak of. The only good thing in the movie is a scene with a lot of gore in the first ten mintues or so (don't want to give away what happens). There is a extra of the dvd talking about and showing how they made the gore, etc. The extra is more entaining than the movie was. Do not buy. If you must see it rent it first. You have been warned..."
2,Highly unoriginal,"This movie, while not ""bad"" is instantly forgetable. In fact, around the time it came to video stores, there were 2 or 3 independent films with similar names and similar covers, with- yes- similar stories put out at the same time. I guess something like that tells you that there's a market for it or at least was. I could see Ghost Rig"" on the shelf and think it was that one that was a theatrical release instead of this one. Can you tell other shark movies apart from ""Jaws""? Other killers from ""Scream 1,2,3""? That's what I thought."
2,uhh,"This movie was okay..it wasn't trash, but it sure as hell wasn't Oscar material. Really gory, the characters are kinda weird..the plot is medicore, but there are a bunch of major plotholes. Like how the main character can detonate a block of C4 two feet away from her and escape unscathed, while a man standing ten feet back get's blown to peices..litterly. Dont waste your time with this..maye watch it if it's on HBO or somthing though.."
4,Some retards have said enough,"THIS MOVIE DOES NOT SUCK!!!! I find it quite enjoyable. It can be creepy at times. I'm the kind of guy that likes everything nobody else likes. Something constructive needs to be done. The ghosts are cool and the ship is designed as if it was haunted, so......what the freak gives?? I still don't know why this movie is treated so badly. It's kind of confusing, but, so what? This is a film that shall not disappoint for a horror fan. I also recommend this with ""HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES"". Please don't hate me for it, guys. I give you a lot of helpful reviews, so I would appreciate it if you would do the same for me."
2,Ghost Ship? Hardly,"This movie was not at all scary ! Never at one point was I scared, but for some reason, I thought it was okay. Definately not the best, but not the worst either. The main thing that I really like is the beggining, even though it was kind of gory. And I liked the part where they show what happens in the past, becuase they do it very well, especailly when they have the flashes, I love when movies have that!But, if you're the type who doesn't like movies without an ounce of scare in them, don't waste your money, unless a friend invites you to watch it or something, but if you think a movie doesn't have to be all scary to be good, then I say see it for yourself, and let you be the judge."
3,Half good Half bad,am reviewing the Blu-ray movie of Ghost Ship the movie start off good but half way through the movie it get's bad.it look's pretty good on Blu-ray it's has a good story line on it but it get's real slopy at the end of the movie is real dispointing.it got some pop up's on it but nothing scary.the characters on it is pretty good but the bad guy they chose at the end of the movie don't fit's on it to good.so it's a pretty good movie but the end of it is just horrible...
2,"""Event Horizon"" at sea","This movie takes some well worn ideas and puts them to sea, along with some 21st century gore and really bad soundtrack. Really too bad, because they still could have turned the material into a great story. Instead we get a couple of shocks, a montage of grisly deaths, and a ""surprise ending"" that's anything but.Still, not a completely abysmal entry in this category. Julianna Margulies is acceptable as a Sigourney Weaver (a la Alien) type who knows how to deal with the situation at hand. There's certainly worse out there."
3,what is Byrne doing in this movie?,"Hum...tired premise, with nothing new! I felt rather ""lied to"" when I saw actors the caliber of Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies was in the film. I thought wow...maybe this is will be a high class horror film. It has great production values and fine acting, but well, duh, from the time they step onto the ship it was down hill on roller skates. In fact, with some small changes this is a rehash of Death Ship (a sad puppy) made in 1980 with Nick Macusso, Richard Crenna and George Kennedy.Bryne and Crew are salvagers and they run into - literatlly - a missing oceanliner loaded with gold and deadly ghosts.The effects are good, and the thrills solid, but just so nothing new. Buy it used, or catch it on telly, for once is enough."
2,"Yeah, right","Another movie that had a great story line ripped to shreds by predictable scenes and cliche-like story sequences. I am a horror movie buff, but the recent surge of so-called horror movies have left a lot to be desired. If you see this movie with the intention of expecting it to be a total B movie, then it might not be bad. To a certain extent, I expected it. I don't know if the intent was to make this movie scary or gory (I feel there is a difference between the two), but this was all gory.The opening scene with the cord is a bit much. I felt like saying out loud ""yeah, right.""Why do they have to make these ""ghost"" movies into ""action"" movies? Is it what people want? I wanted to see a movie about ghosts.I wanted a little suspense. It's weird, because I did like some parts of this movie, but, by the end, I felt like I had seen this story a hundred times."
2,Cliche' horror film that's not convincing...,"If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm about to describe is the most ridiculous opening to a horror film ever: This movie opens with lightly toned, whimsical music and PINK CALLIGRAPHY opening credits!! I mean, What The Hell? I thought it might be a spoof opening, but it wasn't. I couldn't believe that a horror flick could even TRY and do this.The plot was so-so, but I can't understand why Julianna Marguleise and Gabriel Byrne would have accepted the script? They must have needed the money. Anyway, there were a few cool and new effects and horrific ways to kill folk.I think the most horrifying point of this movie is the overall production."
4,Partial remake of an unknown movie,"If you guys liked this movie's story, try to find a movie called ""Death Ship."" It's either from the late 70s or early 80s. This movie scared the heck out of me as a kid.I'm hoping that it will eventually be released on DVD but doubt it will.It's not out on DVD b/c it's relatively unknown but it expands on this movie's story a little better.I believe that the VHS is on sale through Amazon.(Just an FYI)"
3,It's a fun movie- but lacks the scare factor,"I am a horror/thriller movie lover, so this movie did not really scare me too much, but for those who can't quite handle too much scare, this is for you. The plot is basic and there is a little twist in it, most of all I just enjoyed the actors, they all had great character definition, which is nice in a thriller. There are no ditzy characters that walk into the scene when they shouldn't. Their actions are more realistic. Especially Karl Urban, whom I like very much. It is fast-paced and thery get to the point pretty quickly, real nice EFX, if you are into that.Overall a fun movie to watch."
4,Cool Movie.,"The scenes of ""horror"" aren't as numerous as some horror films. It's no slasher. But, it's a great watch for a dark evening. Plus, it has one of the best beginnings of ANY scary movie EVER. I enjoyed the actual story. How many scary movies can boast that? The viewer gets a few true suprises along the way, too! Love that."
3,DANCES W/ GHOSTS,"THE FIRST SCENE WAS COOL AS HELL . IT KELPT MY INTEREST TILL THE LAST HALF HOUR . THAN IT GOT DUMB AND WHAT WAS UP W/ THAT LADY SINGING ! YUCK CAN ANY ONE SAY ""SINGING LESSONS "" I HOPE THEY DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL ."
5,Ghost Ship is the best movie ever.,It was full of cliffhangers. You would think that at frist Greer would die when he died second. The ending was a big twist cause I thought that would not happen.
2,Expected Better.........,"The idea of a haunted ship sounded good to me! I looked forward to seeing Ghost Ship but was disappointed. The film does have a very cool opening scene! which shows viewers what happened on this ship many years ago. The ship ends up disappearing and many years later, a crew finds it as it suddenly re-appears. The crew climb aboard the old cruise ship hoping to claim any valueables that were left. They find more than that... they find the boat haunted! Not a true horror movie but it has some good parts and some not so good parts. If you watch this movie, don't expect to be scared...... you won't be!"
3,Ugh. I could have done without the razorwire,"The beginning of the movie really distracted me from everything else. Hmm let's see.. a 300mph razorwire, slicing through hundreds of men and women, sinews and thick frothy blood, intestines seeping out,unraveling flesh, viscerally opened people. Kinda got to me. I felt pretty ... sick after that.If you can't handle the intestine spurting genre,i'd steer clear."
1,ghostly horrible by anthony m jones,"This movie just flat out sucked with its dull story line ,predictible plot and unapealing characters.The producers evidently tried to redifine horror by making a movie with a boat that could send people straight to hell,been there done that,wow thats original.This movie was poorly slopped together,its run of the mill and its an uninteresting piece of work because of the lack of plot.A group of people borad a haunted boat,find gold ,yay for them but suddenly find them selves screwed because they're only mode of transportation has been destroyed ,there are murderous ghosts around every turn and the devil's assosiate is trying to fill his job quoe by collecting they're souls.Its just a run of the mill ,all out gory gore fest.Take my advice and dont waste your time buying it or renting it.If you ask me I think it was over rated and the only thing scary about this movie is the thought of buying it."
5,Ghost Ship,This movie was one of the better horror movies that I've seen. The music and the action was perfect together. I thought the ending was soooo good and Desmond Harrington was the very BEST in this. He was a little nerdy in the beginning and got better and better. I don't think people gave him enough credit. He deserves a whole lot more because I think he made this movie good. (O:
3,Predictable,"I know the end of this movie half way through (and for me that's telling you something.) I guess I've been spoiled by 'The Ring', but this movie's acting was horrible. The opening scene was gory to say the least and the only good part was the flashback."
2,"a non-scary, messy film","ok, here it goes. You got the crew (Gabriel Bryne, Ron Eldard, Karl Urban, Isiah Washington and Juliana Marguiles), on a voyage to make money on a lost ship, found by (Desmond Harrington). They get in and something starts to happen. They see things, and hear things. Could the ship be alive!(I wonder, Hmmm). Then you get no scares whatsoever, just a really great death rate movie where people get cut in half by extention wires, and gunned down, hanged and stabbed threw the face with a hook. Then theres this big plot twist, The guy who found it and brought them to the ship(Harrington) is actually a ghost and hes harvesting bodys for the ship. Can anyone survive this ordeal, YES, Margulies does and she thinks its over but then, a end that was so gay, bringing Harrington back and him inhabiting another ship. What a waste of my time. Thank's Zack for letting me see this sappy horror movie."
2,"Predictable, somewhat entertaining","Thirteen Ghosts director Steve Beck returns to helm this Dark Castle flick which begins with an awesome display of makeup and digital trickery and a foreboding atmosphere, but the plot is loaded with cliches and is rather predictable who's going to get picked off next. When an ocean liner, missing for the past 40 years, mysteriously re-appears, a salvage crew (led by Gabriel Byrne) is offered to bring her in. Ghost Ship's presentation is slick to be sure, and I really wanted to like this movie, but it leaves you wanting so much more out of it. The cast also includes ER alumni and off-screen partners Julianna Margulies and Ron Eldard, as well as Wrong Turn's Desmond Harrington, Isiah Washington, and Karl Urban who looks like he just walked off the set of Lord of the Rings (which he most likely did). All in all, this is worth a look for horror buffs, but don't expect anything special."
2,not scary in the least...,"This movie had a good plot and some impressive special effects, but isn't a horror movie supposed to be scary? I'm telling you right now, I haven't seen many horror movies and I scare very easily, but neither this or its predecessor, ""13 ghosts"", scared me very much. while the images on the screen were sometimes scary, there was no underlying creepiness or sense of foreboding that movies like ""the ring"" and ""the sixth sense"" had in droves. those movies had a minimum of blood and very little violence, and yet they still managed to scare me senseless and disturb me on a psychological level. i think that movie makers are confusing gore and violence with fear, but unfortunately they are two very, very different things."
2,COME ON!,"Again, I was made to sit and watch yet another horrormovie. I'm chosing the next one we watch! Alas, here isa story of a ship lost for 40 years that all of a suddenappears in the Bering Sea, just waiting for a salvage crew toget all the goodies on board.It starts out all sweet and pretty. Dancing and smilingpassangers soon turn into a bloody mess. Come on! Gross me out!Again I got mad at the characters for doing stupid things instead of getting out of there quickly! However, if they hadthere won't be a movie, but maybe that won't be such a bad thing!Sorry folks, this just wasn't my cup of tea!"
1,Ghostly BAD,"Where do I start for Ghost Ship? I guess that this movie should've remained just that..A Ghost.The storyline is flat, the acting is mediocre, do not expect this movie to make you jump off your seat or make you scream. Like the japanese version of ""The Ring"" Ghost Ship mostly relies on the musical effects and like ""Ringu"" it fails to achieve the desired results. If you want a REALLY good thriller, try the american version of "" The Ring"" or even ""What Lies Beneath"" both great movies.The only scary part about Ghost Ship...it's the price of the DVD!"
2,Typical for the genre and the times,"Any horror movie made during the mid 90s or later is almost always TRASH (exceptions include The 6th Sense, The Others). In these post-modern times, horror movies aren't scary and the characters are more disgusting than the ghosts/monsters. And the music...the heavy metal/alternative noise in Ghost Ship is simply awful. If you want to know how proper horror music sets an atmosphere and a mood, check out any 80s John Carpenter flick or an early 90s Full Moon movie (i.e., Puppet Master, Pit and the Pendulum). I'd recommend the good 80s movie Ghost Story or even the laughable 80s movie Death Ship (OOP, but available at half.com)...over this one."
1,Avoid it,"I was impressed by the trailer and I said to myself if Gabriel Byrne is in, must be alright. I was wrong. It's boring and the end/twist is dumb. They apparently spent much money making this crap. when you listen and wath the ""making of"" in the special features, it sounds like the guys really believe this movie will make it and will be a classic in the genre. Forget it. It's absurd and grotesque."
4,Great fishing book,"I gave this book to my grandson. Since receiving it, he has become a walking, talking fishing expert of facts and trivia. Awesome!"
2,"""Show me your hum-na""","I stole this book from my local Chapters and when I got home was greatly disappointed. I took it upon myself to return it to the store, I just didn't want this piece of garbage cramping my style. Kinnell is up to his usual hijinks, talking about the ins and outs of Life and Love in our time, but this one lacks the charm of his earlier works. I haven't read his earlier works, by the way, but they can't be as bad as this."
1,An Electronic Eye Chart,"Is there a point to this game? No, not really. It seems that Activision wants to test our vision and ruin our hearing at a stroke. Inherent Evil contains no puzzles that involve logic, you simply must be able to spot the tiny, little clue in a tiny, little corner of the screen at a place in the game you thought you had thoroughly searched before. Also, while optically straining, the game manages to be auditorily cruel. The music and dialogue are at incompatable levels; the former engulfing the latter and rendering it indecipherable. In order to hear the dialogue, so that you may follow the story, you must allow yourself to be punished with music that is vaugely tolerable when it is not insanely off key.So do yourself a favor, if you buy this game and for the holy love of Mary, shut off your volume whenever you enter the elevator; this is the true Evil inherent in the game: The Elevator Music."
3,Glitchy but worth it,"I really had a great time playing this game; however there are problems. You can't save a game and if you die you have to start the chapter all over again. Often tedous. All in all, however, it was great fun despite the problems. But then I'm a freak for this kind of mystery game. I like a story line and this at least has one."
5,Great for my Garage Door,My overhead door for the garage was letting in a draft and this product with 3/8 x 3/8 foam weatherstripping sealed it perfectly and lets the door slide easily.
1,Size different from advertised.,This produce was NOT 1 1/2 inches wide but 1 1/8 inches and it was clearly marked as such on the package. I had to return it and I was NOT happy.
2,Movie is far better than this book,"Wow, I'm surprised at how many positive reviews this book got, and how strong they are. I thought this book rambling and very badly written, and that the screenplay author did an incredible job of pulling this book together into a coherent story. I thought the movie did a good job of showing the good and bad in each character, some all bad (of course). In the book, everybody is either bad or all bad."
2,"Too much plot, not enough writing",I like Ellroy better when he writes in English. This choppy style is sometimes almost impossible to understand.
4,Compelling crime fiction marred by a few too many characters,"....and the author's inability to create female characters that don't follow the Madonna/Whore dichotomy. Nevertheless, this was a wonderful book. 1950 LA comes alive in all its seedy glory. beginning, with its rural motel shootout, Ellroy's clipped diction draws you in , grabbing you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end. Although the body count is high and many of the people are, to put it mildly, quite distasteful, a splendid time will be had by all. This isn't noir; this is noir noir."
4,A masterpiece of American crime-fiction.,"What a thriller! Ellroy's multi-character epic is a must-read for the crime-fiction enthusiast. I found myself losing sleep over this book, mainly because I just couldn't bring myself to put it down. While it was thought to be movie adaptation proof, it has obviously been deemed otherwise. Wow! I can't get enough of it."
4,"Very good novel, great movie","I read this novel in two days since I was so riveted. The storyline's structure of three cops of different backgrounds working together was so intriguing. However, Ellroy's style is tough to follow, so much of what confused me was explained in the film. Withal the confusion, good story."
2,Confusing,"After reading the excellent THE BLACK DAHLIA, I had expected something better from James Ellroy. Instead, I was subjected to a brutal (which didn't bother me) and very confusing story about three cops and their involvement with a massacre at a small L.A. diner. The more I delved into the story, the more I became confused. Ellroy had stuffed too many characters and too many storylines into what could have been a compact, yet compelling novel."
1,Overrated,"One-dimensional characters, needlessly convoluted plot, and repetitive language (how many times does the word ""smut"" appear in this book?) -- one of the worst books I've read in a while. For a book ostensibly about Los Angeles, there is little sense of place. It could have taken place anywhere. Why is the mastermind behind the criminal scheme revealed in the prologue, thereby ending all suspense? Why is so much of the book just dull exposition? Why are the action scenes so poorly written that you can't visualize what is going on? And the depiction of African-Americans is flat-out racist."
1,"Extremely strong content, weak character development.","Extreme violence and lude sex are the common theme throughout this book. Character development is poor in my view. Although his choppy writing style may be reflective of Ellroy's attempt to keep the fast-paced killing and sex rolling along, it was annoying and discomforting to me."
1,"Waste of time, money and paper!","This is my first read of Ellroy, and barring some miraculous creative infusion to this author, will also be my last. I quit at about the half-way point, and deleted the book from my Kindle. If there is a plot, I couldn't follow it. The writing style is staccato, with lots of one word and disjointed ""sentences"". Every character....and there are many!....is either In publicservice or walks on the dark side of life, and all are corrupt and violent beyond belief. There's a lot of foul language and unintelligible slang which adds nothing but reader confusion. Perhaps I should have been warned by the title...for this is, indeed, trashy tabloid-type writing. It's a rare day that I can't finish a book, even a bad book, but this one beat me."
1,Boring,This book is awful - it goes on and on with more and more unidentified people - I didn't even bother to finish it.
4,Enjoyable After Seeing the Movie,"Read L.A. Confidential if you loved the movie. The book explores the backgrounds and motivations of the main characters. It also spans over decades, instead of few weeks like the movie. The movie diverges from the book on several plot points probably because of time constraints. The book gets into the Los Angeles power brokers in an interesting take. I also read the screenplay, which discusses the difficulties in adapting the book. I would recommend the reading the screenplay as well, especially the commentary.Breaking News: A Novel"
4,"Very long, very different from the movie","I really liked the 1997 movie i wouldn't say one was better but they were certainly different. And at 500 pages you need to be patient with this book. Read it if you know its going to be your kind of book i suggest you start off with the Black Dahlia, or at least read The Big Nowhere to give you a good idea of the kind of world james ellroy has in store for you."
2,Pieces way to big,"this stuff smells fine, but the things in it are gigantic!!! Use some smaller seed things and fewer big round things and fakey corkscrew things!"
5,Claire Burke Original is Top Drawer,"After the holidays, when all the holiday stuff is put away - a bowl of CB Original Potpourri hints of spring and fresh air. Not heavy - absolutely distinctive - one can smell flowers, roses and herb gardens soaking in a warm sun. Fast Shipping. A++"
4,A Meta-review,"Thompson's book is advertised as radical, but in many respects it is an old story. What is new is not the recognition that Bible history is fiction--scholars have known that for a very long time--but at most a new way of delivering the bad news. Thompson spends as many pages defending the importance of a body of writing that is literally false than he does in making the case that it is false.Folks who dismiss Thompson's book tend to impunge his motives even though motives don't matter as far as truth is concerned. Ibn Warraq, compiler of The Quest for the Historical Muhammad, has been similarly vilified in Amazon reviews.Fact is, all the great religious traditions are based on what are, by our standards, literary frauds. One is at liberty to claim that this fact doesn't make any difference to the faith, but blaiming the messenger doesn't change anything."
1,Too Speculation riddled,"This book like many of the others on the subject, views silence of the archeological record as evidence whether something occurred or not. Then goes on to speculate on the ""truth."" This is similar to the ""proof"" offered by the schools in the of higher criticism that the Bible was untrue. They based it on there being no outside record (to the Bible) of the Hittite people. The Hittite royal library was subsequently found and one can now earn a doctorate in Hittite studies from the University of Chicago.A much better and much more balanced approach to this subject is, ""Is the Bible True?"" by Jeffrey Sheler."
1,"Thompson is in denial, his book is an insult to my intelligence.","This writer uses science to express the denial he is in. What is his problem? He hates Jews, that's obvious. But why then write books about Jewish history, and in such a n unscientific way that it's not even fun to read, let alone factual. No use arguing with those who manipulate the truth, like Thompson, and some of his Copenhagen gang."
4,Thompson overlooks an important alternative,"Thompson's conclusions are logical given the lack of evidence. He argues that since archaeology has failed to discover any trace of pre-exilic Judah and Israel, then the events described in the Old Testament are fantasies. However I cannot understand why he cannot consider the alternative that the OT story is correct but took place elsewhere, not in Palestine. Anyone who can read can see that the so called ""Vision"" of Ezekiel was a plan for a theocratic Utopia and not a return to the Old Jerusalem. The Arabian and particularly the Sabaean evidence strongly suggests that the OT occurred in West Arabia."
5,Samsonite fits great under the airline seat!,Best piece of luggage I ever used! There's a place to easily find my tickets. It stores under the seat in front of me! Lots of space for all of my necessities!
3,Good for storage,"I just recently bought a Viking Designer sewing machine with an embroidery arm. I purchased this item mainly for storage of the machine and arm when not in use. The items are made with a PVC material that I find to be more durable than the sewing trolleys made with fabric that I've seen. The machine, including the cover, fits neatly into the trolley. The tote has ample space for the embroidery arm in its case. Both the trolley and tote have ample padding to protect both pieces. There are additional pockets for storage of smaller items. Both items have carrying handles and shoulder straps. The only reason I did not give this item a higher rating is that the trolley handle is plastic and seems flimsy. If I were planning on attending allot of sewing classes and taking a heavy machine with me I would be concerned that the trolley handle wouldn't last very long before breaking."
3,Too light in weight.,"One of the best switches I have used. However, 2 things to consider:1) Very light in weight. The sheer weight of the USB cables kept ""pulling"" the unit off my desk. So, it's kind of hard to anchor down, unless all your devices are also on your desk.But, (and)2) Hot-key switchable. You don't necessarily need to push the buttons. You can do it from your keyboard... which may make a KVM switch a necessity."
2,A bit deceiving...,"I purchased this book and hungrily read it cover to cover. I had looked at the reviews and was expecting a book that would transfer the skills of improvisation to a corporate environment. The book is well written, but does not deliver on its promise. It spends way to much time rambling on about sizes of groups and spiritual references. Of the 263 pages, about 10 are relevant to corporate trainers, and improvisation techniques that are appropriate in business. Disappointing."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Robert Lowe provides a hands-on guide to using the techniques of improvisational theater to increase spontaneity and creativity in the workplace. He shows how to use these ""improv"" techniques to improve communication, break down bureaucracy and help people in your organization express their talents. He includes many examples, including guided visualizations, fill-in questions and exercises, along with personal stories and accounts from his workshops. While some of the tips on creativity and visualization will sound familiar to those who know self-help literature, Lowe's background in theater and improv makes his approach fresh. We [...] recommend this book as a useful guide for top managers and for anyone leading or working with a group or team. Here's why the show must go on."
1,So disappointing and painful,"I needed this book. As an experienced improv actor and teacher who wanted to do corporate improv training, THIS was to be my guide. My paper mentor (actually, plastic as I had the Audio CD version). But I couldn't get through the first chapter because the writing style made me scream! It's list after list after list.Lists are are horrible way for anyone, especially a creative person, to convey info. After the fifth or sixth item on the fifth or six list, how much do you think sinks in?Add an extrememly rigid narrator, I'm sorry to say, and this book is unusable for me.I tried. I really tried. As I said, I needed this book. But after less than one chapter, I pulled the CD out of the player and, with a combination of disappointment and relief, put it back in its case. Maybe the style gets better as you go on, but I'll never know.Won't someone write a book about this subject that's readable?"
2,Not same product,"I should have known from the price that something was up with this shampoo. I've used this shampoo for about 5 years off and on (mostly on) because I love how it works and I especially love the smell of it. This shampoo that I recieved does not in any way smell the way it should. It doesnt smell bad or anything, it just doesnt smell the same at all. Because of the price I kept the shampoo as it worked alright and was inexpensive but I will order it from my hairdresser again from now on. You get what you pay for I suppose."
4,"Magic Saves, Not Jesus","If you have heard Brant Bjork albums before, you know what you are in for -> A Good Listen To Some Great Tunes, Some Laid Back and Some Pushy, All of Them Groovy.""Saved by Magic"" is no different. Buy This and Jam IT!"
4,Joan Rules,"It's great to have Joan back. Not quite as good an outing as ""What's Inside"", but very folky and atmospheric nonetheless. If only she would get airplay!It's amazing in retrospect that she hasn't fared better in the US. Early songs like ""Cool Blue Stole my Heart"" and ""Willow"" rival the very best of, say, Roberta Flack.Keep it up, Joan. You are very gifted and have many fans."
1,Lovers Speak,"Wow, what a disappointment. I've been a big Joan Armatrading fan since the early 80's and was very excited that she had a new CD out. I was very let down after listening to it. The production quality is average, the lyrics are weak and the melodies don't pull you in. Nothing here I want to sing along with. I think she has such a great voice, both in song and in lyric, and my expectations far exceeded what I heard on this CD."
4,Extremely Listenable!,I've been an Armatrading fan since the early 80's. I have always love her ability to move between a hard edge rock lyric to a beautiful ballad. These Are The Times is a beautiful and sad song. I love her voice and it hasn't changed one bit. Keep going Joan! This one is really going to keep your fans asking for more!I would also recommend any of her work from the early 80's including Me Myself I. Lot's of fun to dance around the house to!
5,Worship isn't as easy as one might think or what you think!?,This isn't a book to be read casually. It is a book upon which one must meditate carefully. I began my read on this book as a follow up on a magazine article that quoted from this book. I found as I read that the author was quite detailed and academic in the material covered. It was obvious from the outset that his path was one to negate modern approaches to something that is timeless-worship. Many would question his belief that worship for the most part has gone awry. He supports his statements with voluminous quotes from the scriptures. One may disagree with his approach to the subject but his scriptural support is inescapable. I consider it a must for anyone who seeks to learn the path of true worship. I recommend it highly.
4,"Fast, convenient Test","This is a great option for those who haven't been diagnosed with diabetes. Once diagnosed, insurance will help pay for tests, but then you've got a ""pre-existing condition"" which might prevent you from getting coverage in the future (seen the movie ""Sicko"" yet?). Along with careful use of a meter, this test can give you an accurate picture of where you stand in this epidemic. Then you can go see your healthcare provider, way ahead of the curve, with an idea of where you stand and having a plan for action.I only gave the test four stars since there was no online way to check my results. I think it took about 10 days to get my results even though the lab tests the blood on the day they receive it. Luckily for me, I dodged this bullet and have made the necessary lifestyle changes.I tell all my patients that you are your ultimate healthcare provider. Use this information wisely and make good decisions. Do your homework!Signed,Ted Hancock, PharmDClinical Pharmacist"
1,Not what I expected,"I had used A1C home tests before, and I was expecting this one to be like that one. Previously I would get the reading in a few minutes right from home, just like a regular Diabetic Glucose reading.This I needed to mail to a lab, and I have not received the results yet!So we will see. Now you understand why I have been tardy with this review."
1,"Reads like Cotton Candy, lacks a solid center","I found Calia's book interesting a first, but quickly tiresome. The writing is a bit amatuerish, with sachrine prose more likely found in a romance novel, almost, as Calia would say, ""desperately so."" All in all, I found it a bit too fluffy. It constantly runs off on romantic or nostalgic tangents dotted with a little history or science to hold it together, but never enough to be satisfying in my opinion. And some of the true comedy of being an astronomer is completely lacking. I can't say that I would truly recommend this book."
