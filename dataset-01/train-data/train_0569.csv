4,I can relate,"Don't know if this movie is really rated very highly by the critics but I can relate. In my prime (middle age) I was suddenly single from a divorce and the ""scene"" was all new to me. Gays and lesbians? what's that. Dating? don't get involved.Both the male and female characters were true in this movie except for the suit of armor. That was a bit much but fit in with the story. Loved the actors. Solid acting but not ""pretty faces"" that Hollywood usually presents.I recommend this movie. Not to everyone but if you are divorced and going thru the process again....watch it."
3,funny and heartwarming,I was a little disappointed with the strong language but I realize it was a part of the character's lives. It made me laugh so hard and then cry too! It's never too late to find true love.
1,Vulgar,"I an not a prude but I watched this movie after it was recommended by a friend. I watches this movie with a pretty liberal girlfriend and we both found it to be extremely vulgar and not even funny, with the exception of the fist scene.And the language was ridiculous and gross! YUK!"
5,Fall on the Floor Laughing,I've watched this 3 times and each time I howl with laughter. Great performances. Great script. Very naughty but tender. It gives us over 50's hope and a chance to laugh at ourselves.
3,Good introductory CD - with a few min-blowing tracks,"I am still stunned by the track on the CD called ""La Zagala"". The singer ""La nina de la puebla"" has a tremendous voice and the song is not like anything I've heard before. This song alone makes the CD worth buing!!! If anyone knows of other recordings by the same artist, I would like to hear about it!"
1,DISSAPOINTED! BAD WARRANTY! BAD PRODUCT!,"I'm so disappointed by this product! I have purchased a DLO action jacket for each ipod I have owned. I finally upgrade to the iphone so of course my next purchase is an action jacket. the belt clip snapped off after 1 month. So I contacted DLO - they have been purchased by Philips, and have useless customer service. they let me know the warranty period expired. In addition amazon has not been any help. I WAS loyal to DLO - now I will buy a case from someone else !"
5,Please buy this book,This might be the last diet book you buy. Start the new you today. I went to a lecture by Dr Pawlak and she really knows the subject.
2,Sports bloopers not quite ready for prime time,"I have not much basis for comparison, but this set of 4 sports bloopers videos is the most disappointing ""production"" I have seen in years. The footage is good, but the audio is grade-school level sound effects and voice-overs. It was painful to watch. I made it through 30 minutes of the Football Bloopers video before quitting and inserting the Basketball Bloopers video. That lasted 10 minutes. I changed to the Baseball video and lasted about 5 minutes, just long enough to determine that the video played and tracked correctly. Someone, somewhere, may appreciate these videos, but I believe most people would find them a waste of time and money."
5,Beautiful,This is a beautifully photographed and thougtfully presented volume which is educational as well as a joy to behold. Lovely for gifting.
4,Enduring Cuba,"I have been to Cuba and absolutely loved the country. This book is an honest, unbiased look at Cuba, its people and the challenges they face."
3,Scattered information,"I purchased this book because I will be traveling to Cuba with an educational group in May and wanted some information in addition to the typical travel guides. This book does provide some insight into the people and places in Cuba in recent years,based on the author's travels and people she met. It does seem the information is rather scattered. Overall it is an interesting read."
4,Definitely worth the money!!,"I studied by mostly using this book and scored a 750. I agree that it isn't exhaustive, but it gave me a great idea of what to expect. I like that it isn't this huge, thick text...it kept me from being too overwhelmed, and I was actually able to read the entire thing very quickly. The practice test is helpful as well. If you review your 'best practices' texts, intro class notes, and know your bell curve, you should be fine. As with anything, you can't expect one book to completely prepare you."
2,Educator,I was very disappointed with this book. I provided little more than a handout. Book description given online was very misleading.
4,A decent resource for preparing for the exam,"I will admit that I only looked at the practice test in the back of the book the day before the actual exam; however, the practice test was very representative of the actual test items (although some were outdated). In fact, some of the practice questions were on the actual exam."
3,Basic,"I found the guide to be a very basic review for the praxis2. If you are looking for something comprehensive, this is not the guide for you. If you are looking for a supplemental review, go ahead and buy it."
1,Not so much,"After reading the reviews I thought it would be a helpful guide to studying for the PRAXIS II. In comparison to the real exam, the practice test in this book had 4 choices instead 5 (like on the PRAXIS), had such brief, short questions/answers---- a far cry from the real test. I studied for 3 weeks, using this book and NASP Ethics & other School Psych texts, and I was disappointed that I didn't pass. The real exam is lengthy, wordy, more tricky and in-depth than expected. There should be more study guides & ""real-life"" practice tests available out there rather than just this book. The only reason I would say buy it bc its the only study guide resource out there, but don't put all your faith in. Good luck."
4,it worked,"i used this book and passed with a 720. it's straightforward, and the practice test was useful -- i recognized several questions on the actual exam from the practice test. my one complaint is that the peter thompson did not include explanations for some of the more ambiguous questions.also, although thompson recommended going to outside resources to expand on his suggested topics, i just put the provided study outline onto flashcards and studied from those; i didn't have time to go through my grad notes and textbooks. i also bought the new edition of ethics and law for school psychologists and studied from that. hope this helps; good luck!! :)"
4,I passed,"I read the book and passed with a 710. The only minor criticism I have is that the practice test has four choices per question and the real test has 5 choices. On the real test, out of the 5 choices, there are TWO GOOD options for each question, so when I left the test, I had absolutely no idea if I passed or totally tanked. I am very, very glad I had the book. I didn't think that the information in the book was dated (as another reviewer commented.) I took the exam in June 2005. GOOD LUCK to you all!"
1,Out of date,"This book was created in 2004 and the Praxis II School Psychology Exam was updated in 2008. I would not use this to study because it is out of date. Study from the Best Practices series and buy the downloadable ETS Guide. If you do some practice questions and review the matieral you are least familiar with, you will do fine. Study the ethics guidelines from NASP, their position statements, and the most important special education laws. You don't need this book."
1,DO NOT BUY!,I bought all sorts of cookie cutters with the hope of getting my toddler to eat more foods. I now recommend the plastic ones or coated versions. Although these are sharp...they rusted after the FIRST use! I hand-washed them...just like instructed...but they rusted before drying on the dish rack! Now I don't want to use them for fear of feeding my child rust. I would not recommend anyone buy these unless they want to hand-wash and then immediately hand-dry.
1,Rusted & Disgusted,"It's true what everyone says, they will ABSOLUTELY rust on you as sure as the sun rises. Very disappointed and disgusted with this product."
1,Wilton cookie cutter,Don't buy this set. I used it once and it already rusted after wash and air dry. The metal is cheap quality not stainless steel. I guess that's why it's cheap compared to other brand. Very disappointed with Wilton brand.
3,Meh,"Maybe I'm ridiculous but both times I have tried using these cookie cutters the dough sticks to them and it ruins the shape. So far they have been useless to me (except for the sugar cookie recipe on the inside of the label which I've used and like). I have tried using the cookie cutters dry and with cooking spray and either way, the dough sticks so now they're back in the box living in the back of a kitchen cabinet."
3,OK - wish I could find better that didn't cost the earth,"These are not your mom's (or grandma's) cookie cutters. You will not be tossing these in a pile in the drawer with the other cookie cutters and odds and ends. Or if you do, you'll have to bend them back into shape.They are just this side of flimsy. With careful handling they shouldn't bend far enough out of shape that you can't nudge them back, but too much of that and the thin metal will eventually break from stress fatigue.I would rather have paid a few dollars more for better quality, sturdier cutters. Had I seen these in person it is unlikely I'd have bought them. But cookie cutters are nearly impossible to find these days - they're either cheap shoddy plastic, too small, too gigantically huge, or ridiculously expensive (like $5 or $10 or even more EACH).They're better than plastic, but I would gladly have paid 50% more to get 50% more metal."
4,A little flimsy,"These mostly do the job but they are not real sharp and I have to push hard and jiggle them around, they also feel pretty flimsy. Also, if they get really dirty I rinse them off and they are already starting to rust. Despite all that, they work well enough and for the price do a good enough job."
3,Cute,"This set is nice. It's easy to do. But it stains really fast. I have been using it for 3 times, and now I see many dark stain spots. I would not recommend this. It is cheap, so you get what you pay for."
4,Awesom Music - STILL MISSING ONE OF THE SONGS!!!,"Of course Coverdale's vocals smoke... and the version of 'Fool For Your Loving' included here is my favorite. 'Ain't No Love In the Heart of the City' is an awesome cross between melancholy blues and metal. But while better than the CD with 3 songs from the 11/23/78 Hammersmith show left off, they still left off one version of 'Come On' that was on the original double lp set (the strongest version, at that). Still, this is the most complete version to date that I know of.I'm waiting for the double CD reissue with bonus tracks- hint hint!!!March 20, 2007 UPDATE!The 2 CD version is out. No bonus tracks, but at least all of the original tracks. My favorite Whitesnake release ever!"
2,Good for two years only,"I purchased this printer as part of a package directly from Dell in 2006. It did work adequately for about 2 1/2 years, but definitely not good for large print jobs. The scanner went first - I am still not sure if it is the software or the scanner itself - but it stopped being able to be used because it froze up the entire computer to where it had to be shut down each and every time I attempted to use it. Then the copier function went. Lastly, the feeder stopped working and I tried everything - including opening up the back and turning it upside down to shake anything that might have gotten stuck in it. All to no avail. So, bottom line - if you need a printer for only two years and don't want to spend much - this could fit the bill. For any long term use - spend a little more and get something that has quality.I also agree with the others about Dell's customer service - it is just about non-existant in terms of usefulness."
1,Not Reliable,"I've had this one for two years and it has stopped printing and gives an error message telling me the cartridges are missing, when they are not. Cleaning the contacts makes no difference. Rebooting makes no difference. I'm ditching it and getting an HP. This is the last time I buy a Dell product. From here on out, I'm going Mac or HP."
2,I own one,"It works well BUT Dell is the pits... they no longer carry this model and it costs more to repair then replace. The next model up has different cartridges so if you have any left when this model goes, tough luck as they can only take a specific kind of cartridge. the quality is good, but unless you like talking to foreigners that speak broken english, you don't get very far with tech support."
1,Not compatible with mac,This does NOT work with any Mac OS. It uses a proprietary windows printer language.
2,Slow printing....Beware..,"Beware...Slow printing...Would not recommend..I got my printer from Dell...When I bought my Desk Top Computer...Worse mistake I did...Does only print 1 page at a time...Please check out others printers and forget this one...So,save your Money....and check others out...I will be taking mine to the Mission shop...To Slow for Me..."
5,Edelbrock Victor Series Water Pump 84-91 Corvette,This water pump exceeds expectations and REALLY works as described in product description. I have increased water flow though my engine and stabilized my water temp throughout the engine resulting in a more effecient cooling system which is badly needed in a Corvette.
4,Good starter bag,This is a pretty good starter bag for a small camera with a couple of lenses. Its main drawback is the inability to strap a tripod on to it.
4,Unlike Anything Else By Them,"...and if I'm wrong, please tell me what others I'm missing! This album features 5 long tracks, only one with lyrics. The tunes are originals, and feature wordless vocals, modal chord structures, odd time signatures, even some free blowing on one track. The melodies are at once catchy and unusual. The use of Wurlitzer electric piano (played by Roy) adds nice color and texture. An insanely hip record - imagine if the Carpenters or Brasil '66 were hired to write prog music for films used in European industrial trade shows in the mid 70s. Hopefully this gem will get a US release now that the CTI label has been reactivated."
3,over priced,"Haven't had a chance for my grandson to use this much so far. At first when put in the water it wouldn't run, checked bateries etc and it ran after that. However the outboard on the rib boat (on the battery cover was broken off when received) didn't want the to go through the trouble of returning it etc etc so left it broken off. Also a rubber type o-ring was with the boat and have no idea what that is about i.e drive belt or maybe some kind of packaging. Only instruction was printed on the box. Guess in summing it up it's typical imported item sold on Amazon"
1,Great fun but broke down after only 40 minutes,"We just got the toy today and went with my 6 years old son to try it. It's fun, my son loves it. We used it for 30 minutes with a full battery. The boat is able to go at least 35 meters away and you can still control it.After this we recharged the battery and came back to the pond. After 10 minutes only 1 propeller turned, the second one was ot of order without clear reason. The fun turned into despair. There is no way to try to fix it because you cannot open it (everything is sealed so we sent back the toy (it costed us 15 dollars) and asked for a refund instead of an exchange. We do not recommend this toy."
1,Worst Boat Ever,"I ordered this boat for our son's Birthday. All he wanted was a police boat w/ lights & sounds! After much debate after reading the bad reviews on this boat, I thought, well maybe my boat won't have any problems.........I wouldn't even give this boat a star because the thing didn't even work and couldn't get it to work,also the time it takes for the battery to charge is a long time. It is very heartbreaking to have to tell your son that sorry the boat doesn't work, so knowing we had to do something to make-up, I went to ""Toys R Us"" and bought a remote control monster firetruck w/ lights,sound & that squirts H2O and the battery life is great and not to mention that it charges in 1 hour!!! (Our son loved the firetruck) I read where some reviews said the boat didn't work and reviews that it had problems. I took a chance and wished I hadn't! So if this helps anyone when looking at the reviews DON'T BUY THIS BOAT!!!!!!!!"
2,"anti-semitism at root of so-called ""Curse""","At the heart of the so-called ""Curse"" is the notion that a financially-strapped Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth in order to finance his musical ""No No Nannette."" Historian Glenn Stout's ESPN article demonstrates the fallacy of this slander -- a slander invented by Henry Ford's bigot newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, whose editors believed Frazee was Jewish.Just to be clear, no one -- Stout included -- is accusing Shaughnessy of anti-semitism. Nor is anyone making that accusation of George Vescey of the New York Times, the columnist believed to have coined the term, Curse of the Bambino. But their reactions to Stout's research reveals a lot about their respective characters. Vescey was appalled and embarrassed, and he wrote that he wanted nothing more to do with the ""Curse."" Shaughnessy, on the other hand, was utterly dismissive, insisting that the ""Curse"" is still a ""fun"" way to think about the Red Sox. Oy vey."
1,Disappointing,"It's clear that this is a last-ditch attempt for Mr. Shaughnessy to 'cash in' on the fabricated curse that has been his 'raison d'etre' for the last 20 years. If you wish to re-live the Red Sox 2004 World Series run, look elsewhere. If you want to read the rantings of a man who has suddenly lost his purpose in life, by all means, buy this book."
1,The shank strikes again,"Yet another mailed-in effort by the self appointed ""Keeper of the Curse"". Forget it Dan. There never was a curse until you decided that you needed more income than the Globe provided. In your never-ending quest for relevance you have decided to try to continue to cash-in on the hard work of others by keeping your ""Curse"" alive. The only curse that Boston has had to suffer from is the one that keeps you employed by the Globe. Save your money Sox fans. Buy any book other than this one."
1,The Curse of the Talentless Hack,"Shaughnessy's gravy train has finally left the station and this book is one last desperate attempt to milk the cash cow of the supposed ""curse."" Maybe Shaughnessy will now turn his attention to his long-anticipated autobiography ""The Curse of the Talentless Hack,"" in which he explains to the reader how to write the same newspaper column over and over again for 20 years and still get paid for it. Now that the Sox and Patriots are champions, Shaughnessy will probably cook up the ""Curse of John Havlicek"" for the Celtics or the ""Curse of Phil Esposito,"" for the Bruins"" so he will have an excuse to write another lame book."
1,Truly an awful book written by an awful writer,"I borrowed this book and am glad but feel bad for my poor friend who brought it. Written in whiney prose I could not finish it. I was going to let it pass unti I recently came across a quote of said author:""Red Sox-Yankees has evolved into the very best drama in all of sports andwith that comes no shortage of themes, which are often silly or contrived(remember 'The Curse of the Bambino'?)."" Shaughnessy, written after game 3 of last year's ALCS.So he tiredly wrote this book using his own contrived theme. It shows and to the uninformed but still curious, wait a few more weeks when this masterpiece goes in the discount rack. The fact the publisher won't let potential readers get an excerpt from the book should say something."
1,Learn why all Boston hates this guy,"The Team has always held Shaugnessy in contempt. "" He who cant write writes negative sports stories ""."
1,Troubling,"Groping between incoherent and irrelevant, Mr. Shaughnessy flails away at our collective unconsciousness. Freedom never felt so dirty and ashamed. If you are a Red Sox fan, avoid this book."
1,How do we reverse the Curse of Shaughnessy?,I thought the next book would be The Curse of Minky Ball.
4,Interesting for the pre-playoff info,"Dan Shaughnessy is an excellent sportswriter and one of the few reasons to still buy the Boston Globe. If you've ever heard him on the radio you will notice that the tone of the book is the same as the tone of his voice.This book explores the magical season of the sox, but doesn't focuse so much on the magic as the trial and tribulations that got the sox there. The fact that the focus is not on the games that every sox fan has already memorized and instead on the background makes it a better book.The players , the front offce are treated as people and their foibles rather than on the images. His handling of the Nomar trade is excellent. He rightly declares the trade the pivitol moment of the season and produces the stats to back it up.I'm not sure if it is a vital addition to your Baseball or Red Sox library, but it will be a welcome one."
1,Doesn't Make Any Sense,Doesn't the Red Sox winning the World Series prove that there never was a curse and that the whole thing was just a gimmick for marginal sports writers to sell books?
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,"There is more to learn in stillnessThan in talk or noveltyAllow yourself when sitting, to sitwhen being, just to be.~Karen GreenThe cover of Tao Music for Relaxation is beautiful and inspires relaxation by water with vanilla candles. An orange flower floats in a shimmering jade bowl surrounded by candles.The soothing spiritual beauty of mysterious bamboo flutes, xaphoon, delicate piano, tabla, ocean drum and angelic vocals by Shannon Kingsbury will lead you into stillness and infuse you with a desire to surrender to stillness.Tao Music for Relaxation takes your soul to new dimensions of being so everyday cares melt into waves of tranquility and musical heaven. Perfect for massage, meditation, reflection, escape into sound or relaxation.~The Rebecca Review"
1,Cheesy,"Don't waste your money. This is horribly cheesy-mostly synthesizer style music. If you like to feel like you are in a 1980s music video in outerspace, I guess this is the album for you.........The Zen Meditation album I picked up at Target is a million times better."
2,Falling apart a year later,"We had just purchased a house and the mailbox was falling apart, so we needed a new one but didn't want to spend a ton of money...this was a great deal for getting a new mailbox, so we thought. 1 year later the flag piece is constantly falling off and the lid won't stay shut! I suppose its a good deal if you don't care about replacing it 1 year later like we're going to have to do."
1,Missing parts!,"I recieved my mailbox with just a flag in it, no other parts. No handle, no screws no nothing. The directions tell you what to do to put it together but you can't do it because you have no parts!!! I feel like I am always getting ripped off online. Time to go to home depot or true value hardware."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I bought the box at Lowes. The box had black grease on it, hot glue residue, and the door was bent and damaged and would not close properly.I called the 800 number and they said they would ship me a new box in 2 weeks.Hope the one they ship me is good."
3,"Good, but not as great as other Veggie Tales","I was a little disappointed with this DVD mainly because you can't select each individual episode.The episodes just run straight through as part of a presentation that Bob and Larry do. It doesn't give you the option to select an episode.(Although, you could easily just do the chapter selection, also note the episodes don't go in same order as listed in the description so you'd have to be careful which chapter you're selecting.)Not a big deal, just not what I expected.I also didn't think the short episodes were as cute as the movies they've done. I bought this DVD because I wanted the Snoodles Tale for my kids, but I'm sure they will like the other episodes too and you can never go wrong with the morals taught in the videos.I'd recommend this product, just wanted to let you know a little more about the DVD."
5,All Veggie Tales DVDs deserve 5 Stars,"If you're considering buying any of the Veggie Tales DVDs please don't hesitate any longer. They are ALL wonderful! My grandchildren, aged between 3 and 7 years can't get enough of these characters. The messages are simple enough for a 3 year old to understand and they all love the funny songs and sing along at the top of their voices - I think I'll buy some earplugs to save my sanity ! ;o)"
3,Why does this book have to be so religious?,I didn't think that a book about naturally healthy pregnancies would be filled with bible references. I just searched through for information. This is not a book that I would lay back in bed to enjoy.
5,O'Hara Gets It Right Again,"O'Hara does a great job with dialogue and setting scenes. In these three novellas, we see three stories focusing around one man's trip throughout his life. We see the many instances in which this individual is forced to make choices about how he wishes to live. The first choice's impact is reflect in the following novella, and the same with the second in the third. This makes for great reading because we see how difficult this individual finds it to travel through his life without being forced to confront past mistakes. Anyway, this is a great book that should receive more attention then it has to this point. Get it and enjoy."
4,Great notebook case,"This case is great for value and for space..for the most part. It's actually really hard to find a good value leather case for a 15.4 notebook, but this was it. Unfortunately though not much room for any other types of peripheral, ie notebook mouse, once my adaptor and power cord went in, as nothing else but my notebook fits in that compartment so they had to go in another, but all in all, really nice case, and not too heavy being leather either. Another good point ladies is that its looks are relatively unisex, not too masculine but not too feminine either. Highly recommended."
3,Handsome Case,Looks nice. Only complaint is if moderately packed it is hard to close. Good for the light traveler.
5,Targus Notebook Case,It has many compartments to put the necessary equipment and or papers for a school teacher to bring to work with.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,The Wexford Skeleton caulk gun performed exactly as promised! I am always happy with the quality of all the COX caulk guns I have purchased!
5,Great caulk gun,"This is a well made and smooth working caulk gun. I'm told that this type doesn't last as long as a rachet type, but I don't think any non-professional ever wore out a caulk gun. Will update in 20 years..."
3,good kid's video,"This video is excellent for children to begin learning about physics. I'm twenty eight, and I overlooked the description and bought this not realizing it was a child's dvd. That was okay with me because my physics knowledge is pretty much at a kindergarten level, and this was a easy place to start my learning. Pretty embarrassing,though! Also, the dvd doesn't play all through, you can watch each law of physics section separately, so if your kid has a 3 second attention span, that's okay because each section is quite short."
4,Good bait,"Very pleased with purchase,had been looking for cd quite a while.CD was in good shape and is my constant audio companion.My dealings with amazon has been swell and I'm very impressed."
5,Great small- to mid-size digicam bag!,"I've kept my Canon Powershot G2, Speedlite 420EX, extra set of 4 AA's for the Speedlite, and a couple of extra CF cards in this bag for about a year now. Works great ... although there are times when I'd also like to put more accessories in it (charger, lens cleaner, etc) and there isn't enough room, so I may be moving up to a larger Lowepro or Tamrac bag soon. The bag is nicely padded and soft (the ""non-scratch"" lining is important for digicams with unprotected LCD screens, but isn't an issue for a G2)."
5,Outstanding,"My Canon A80, Panasonic BQ-390 quick charger with 4 extra batteries, uplink cord, A/V patch cord and extra CF cards all fit nicely in this case. There is a little more room in it for a few other things too. The little rain hood that is sewn in the back is a plus that I didn't expect. Great case, compact design. Beats the snot out of the Canon case hands down."
4,Tight fit,"Don't plan to keep batteries or lenses along with your camera in this bag. So tight, sometimes camera switch turns on when you insert camera in bag. Adequate if no accessories. Weather protection cover a big plus in the rain."
3,Expensive comparing with other products.,"I bought it for my canon G5, it is good, simple, but much expensive comparing with other similiar products (e.g. samsonite). The AW cover is not very useful."
3,Great collection BUT......,"Big fan of Toshiro Mifune. Love all the movies. Really liked Samurai Assasin and Red Lion, Incident at Blood Pass. Samurai Banners included NO subtitles whatsoever. The disk and my DVD player will not remedy this issue and this movie is a ""silent"" film for me. If your a Toshiro fan I still recommend it highly."
3,"""The Ultimate Collection"" yeah right!","Although all great films in this collection, 5 films is not what I'd consider ""The Ultimate Collection."" Would have gotten a higher rating if the box set was titled differently. Mifune was in far more than 5 films, and the ones chosen for this set weren't even his best films."
1,"Nice idea, poor quality","I have now bought two of these cleaners. The first one came with the shaver. Within about a year, the arm stopped locking in place so I had to rig a rubber band to hold it in place. Six months after that, the cleaner stopped working altogether.So I bought a replacement unit. Within weeks, the machine started malfunctioning. Some times I hear it cleaning in the middle of the night. It just starts up of its own accord despite the fact that this is more than 15 hours after I shaved. Now it does not disengage and leaves the razor wet when I go to use it in the morning.Nice idea for a product, but the quality is lousy."
3,"You need it, if you own one.","If you're looking at this review, chances are you bought the braun razor that comes with this, and the base is now broken. Let me guess...it won't stay locked down to charge and clean? Yup, same as everyone else. You can either buy a totally new razor and base, or buy this replacement. I have only had it a few months, so we'll see if this one breaks this year as the original did."
3,It works so far.,It does work but I shouldn't have to buy another one. The original one stopped pumping the cleaner and I couldn't fix it so I bought this.
5,"Great service, great book, great in keeping promises",I already knew that this was a great book after owning a copy of my own. I purchased this one for a coworker. It arrived in time and I had no problems at all! Thanks!
5,Great band!,"I'm contributing because I don't see the songs listed anywhere here -- so here they are:1. HOLD ON TO LOVE2. FREE3. SOUND RAINBOW4. FOLLOW YOUR ROAD5. LIGHT THE LIGHT6. MORNING STAR7. IMAGINE8. ENCHANTED DANCEI loved this whole album in the late 70s, and bought this cd mostly because of the incredible Follow Your Road that I still remember clearly after not hearing it since I stopped using an LP turntable in about 1990.I saw them at UCLA performing in the student union in I think 1979 or 1980 ... they were well received, but true to my not hearing much about this band in the general public, the turnout was not large... maybe 200 people.There has never been a band that sounded anything like these guys... they're awesome."
5,"Seawind ""Light the Light"" Great to hear it again on CD!!!",This album is as good as back in the day when I had it on vinyl. I always liked her voice and the music of Seawind.
3,Padded but unwieldy,"The case is well-padded, but bulky and a bit loose fitting for a Canon A610. Its size makes using the belt loop impractical, it's just too big. The four interior compartments are a bit excessive; other than a camera pouch there only needs to be one other pocket to hold batteries, a lens cloth, and an SD card. This thing's just so boxy that you can only really carry it as a full-blown tourist with a strap around your neck, or packed into some check-on luggage. It'll undoubtedly withstand tall drops and poor baggage handlers, along with wet weather thanks to its nylon cover, but it's overkill for most typical camera environments. Removing the camera from the case is also annoying because of the long zipper path; likely you'll end up with camera in hand most of the time, lest the zipper cause a missed photo opportunity. This seems like a fine case for the ultimate camera protection, but for most casual photographers too much of a hassle for routine use."
5,Great all around,"I recommend this bag for anyone wanting protection and versatility. It fits extra items such as some cash and dl and debit card easily so on a small excursion, I don't need to carry anything else. Perfect fit for my slightly odd shaped Cannon too."
5,Best camera bag I've ever owned!,"Fits my Canon A-620 PERFECTLY. Has space for 4 extra AA batteries. Separate storage for extra SD cards. And very well padded. On top of all that, it's weather resistant, too. For the price, I can't imagine finding a camera bag better than this one."
4,intense plunge,"The music on TRIO is too slow for my liking. This is especially true of ""Back Home Blues"" and ""I Can't Get Started"". Even so, I appreciate the immense talent of Mr Charles Mingus which this CD displays. My favourite tunes are ""Dizzy Moods"" ""Summertime"" and ""Hamps New Blues"". The latter is an exceptional display of interplay between Mr Mingus and Mr Danny Richmond (d)."
3,Not Mingus' best work,"This album is worth buying if only for the very imaginative take on ""Summertime"". Danny Richmond (drums), as usual, smokes on this track and on this album.Otherwise, this is a fairly average album. It is well recorded, and is a nice snapshot of Mingus playing in a trio setting. Unfortunately, with the exception of Summertime, it doesn't really show off Mingus's genius as an arranger, and his solo playing here is occasionally [gasp] lackluster.Of course Mingus doesn't get much help here from Hampton Hawes' consistantly mediocre playing. Their interplay sounds very rudimentary compared to the things Bill Evans and Scott LeFaro were doing a couple of years later.I don't want to seem harsh on this album. I do listen to it quite a bit, but it doesn't compare favorably to Mingus's greater work."
5,"Great Tool, reasonable price ...",... for just about the best weeding tool I've ever used. Bought a few to share with neighbors and they love it too!
5,Excellent hand tool for gardening great for weeding,"Excellent hand tool for gardening great for weeding, gets in around all the stem and cuts out the weeds nicely, Made in USA also is huge for me."
3,Not as comprehensive as I would like,"The book was an okay overview of the Hindu faith, but I felt at times like the chapters ended abruptly with no summary of the material covered in the chapter. It appeared like the author just wanted to move on to the next topic. I also expected more information regarding the various Hindu festivals and branches of Hinduism, but that was not the case. This book works for a person taking a religion class who perhaps needs a broad overview,but for someone who is a new convert, or possibly considering conversion, this book is lacking."
3,Adequate Review for New Readers,"A qausi-scholarly text (meaning some, but not all of its sources are cited), this book is very readable and provides an adequate review of Hinduism, though I do not myself profess to be a consummate expert. At times ""theistically thick"" or very religiously friendly, it nonetheless seems to give a fair introductory review of basic concepts, deities, and beliefs of Hinduism. I can recommend it only as one source work, amongst others, for those scholastically inclined."
1,Not Much of An Overview..,"This book didnt seem to cover Hinduism that much, more like the temples and the history of the Indian people...not much on the religion itself...Not my best pick, I'd say keep looking."
5,"Simple, yet comprehensive!!!","I own a copy. It is the best gift that I could get from anybody. The points I really liked are Hinduism is an eternally current religion, the fact that it is not a one-book, one-founder religion and that it accomodates everybody in the world under the brought concept of seeing divinity in each other. This book, the story of Swami Vivekananda and my personal understanding of the divine Hindu concept of 'Seeing Divinity in Everything and Everybody' inspired me to write a smallerHinduism Simplifiedbook on Hinduism called, ""Hinduism Simplified"". Thank you Swamiji,Anupkumar Shetty, the author of 'Hinduism Simplified'"
5,Excellent book summarizing Hinduism,"This is one of the best books written that will give the reader a working knowledge of one of the oldest and very complex religions in the world - Hinduism. I would say reading this book can be even more helpful for Hindus themselves (like me) who by being a Hindu may think that they ""know"" but in fact are painfully ignorant of even some of the fundamentals of Hinduism :)I feel very fortunate to have come across this book and am amazed by the author Swami Bhaskaranandaji's handling of such a complex subject in a simple yet comprehensive manner."
2,"Worthle$$, but hilarious--a Money Time!!","This book was of no use to me at all. They changed all of the chapters around for the next edition, which I was supposed to have, so that you have to buy the new one. I'll take an axe to that one if no one buys it back; the only redeeming quality of this book is the discussion on student dialog which is hilarious. They have a whole discussion on how Ebonics is a ""sophisticated language with a defined set of rules"" and they pathetically attempt to introduce prospective teachers to slang terms from the early 90s such as ""chickenhead"" ""da bomb"" and ""we had a money time last night!""Classic unintended racial stereotyping by the clueless textbook authors from Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan."
2,Listed size is not correct,"The bag is not quite the size that the Lowepro webpage indicates. The page says it has 6.5 inch height clearance. And while the bag is that size on one side, the other side slopes down, resulting in less than 6.5 inches of height. So my 6 inch Canon powershot doesn't fit in the bag well."
3,"Great Bag, Wrong Size","I had to return the camera case because my Canon 40D with the kit lens (28-135mm) was about a half an inch too long to fit in the bag. The case appeared to have great construction and I loved the size and style. I actually jumped over to an M-Rock Teton which fits perfectly. Although it doesn't have the Lowepro name, it has the same features with similar durability."
4,"Great bag, a little small","I love this bag for holding my camera, but the little pouch on the outside isn't really large enough for too many extra items. It fits my speedlight and computer cord, but that is about it. This is great for toting around, though, because it is light and very portable."
3,A tight fit,"LowePro makes very nice camera bags and cases, but this one recommended by Amazon for the Nikon D40 does not fit the camera very well, even with the standard 18-55 lens. If you use the 55-200 lens it is even worse. Nice case, poor recommendation for the D40."
4,"Good bag, a little small.","Very good camera bag, my canon xsi feets perfectly. Maybe it should have more pockets. But its very good for tourist traveling."
5,Keeps my Nikon safe,This bag has stayed intact for several years and through numerous rough journeys and inclement weather. And it's not heavy.
5,Best little SLR bag I've found,"Anyone who says that their SLR won't fit must have an over sized camera. I can fit my Canon 30D or my wife's Canon Rebel XT with an EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens UV filter and lens cap without problem.A couple of nice features:- the non-slip surface of the shoulder strap actually works.- the ""backwards"" opening of the flap while it seems funny at first is actually safer to use.- the adjustable velcro bolsters allow you to set the support for the right sided handgrip lower thus keeping the camera back level.- the front pocket is big enough for my charger and an extra battery while the inner mesh pocket holds an extra memory card and a cleaning cloth."
2,Great case but a bit small for Nikon D3000 with 18-55mm,"This is a very nice case but it's a bit too small for a Nikon D3000 with the 18-55mm VR lens. Initially, I thought this case was going to be perfect, based on the reviews I read earlier. However, the case is a bit too small for the D3000, perhaps the 18-55mm lens on the D3000 is longer than others, or maybe the UV filter pushed it over the edge (don't have another SLR to compare against). There's also not as much room at the top as I expected. Anyway, I bought a Lowepro TLZ 1Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 Camera Bag (Black)instead, which is perfect for the D3000."
4,"Good, but quite small","Got this product for half price as part of a deal with a Canon Digital Rebel XTi. The camera itself is one of the smallest SLRs out there, and it fits in the bag fine. However, if paired with even a slightly above-average sized lens (e.g. the EF-S Canon 10-22mm), the system doesn't fit into the bag.This bag is truly for small cameras with small lenses. If you're not sure, I suggest looking elsewhere. It's an okay bag for the price, but I don't think it's worth the hassle of returning it!If you're looking for a small bag that can handle more than this, I recommend the M-Rock Glacier or any one of the other Lowepro bags."
4,Barely enough room for Nikon D40,"A couple of inches roomier in depth would allow for a more agile access to the camera and its strap. You do have to fiddle to accommodate nikon's strap. I frecuently end up carrying the camera without any protection at all. It is OK for tranportation , storage and protection from impact . I might try a case that allows me to operate the camera witout a complete removal from its case."
4,Works for T2i,Fit's the Canon T2i no problem. Pouch under the lid will hold memory cards and the small extras. Outside pouch is very roomy. Strap is a little stiff but I think it will work in over time. The low price makes this an excellent buy.
2,Bag too small w/stock battery grip,This camera bag is just too small for a Canon Rebel XTI w battery grip. Unable to close top
2,Does not have storage space for the extra lens,"Good only if you are using a single lens for your camera. Does not have space to store the second lens.I'd recommend that you buy your camera first; take the camera to a store and choose the appropriate bag you want.Once you choose, you can then get it from Amazon. Regretting that I didnt do that."
3,Really a MINI Bag.........,I have a Nikon D40. If you are looking for a bag that stores just the camera with a 28-55mm lens(no strap) very snugly then this is a product for you. If you plan to use this with a 55+ mm zoom then the camera will not fit. Even if you have a strap on the D40 with a small lens it will not fit into the bag. I honestly feel that you would be better off with a larger bag so that you can store your charger and an additional lens. This may be suitable for smaller cameras but not the Nikon D40. The quality of the bag is great and I ended up getting a larger Lowepro that I really like.
4,Will not fit Canon XTI with the 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM lens attached,"Seems like a nice bag, but for those of you out there wondering: This bag will not fit a Canon XTI with the 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM lens attached. I'm sure it would fit the kit lens and then some. Seems nice."
5,Perfect Fit,This is a perfect fit for a Nikon D40 w/ an 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens. Even has enough room to tuck in the camera's strap.
4,Snug Bag.,This is a nice bag to keep a compact DSLR in. It has just enough room for my D40 camera and strap in the main section while a spare battery and lens pen is in the outside pocket. It is tight to fit the strap in however it feels secure in the case. I would have to get a larger one if I upgrade my lens over the 17-55 I have now.I feel the cushioning is quite good for the bag and it is just great for a person who wants to travel light.
4,Good Camera Bag,"Camera bag is good for camera only. No real room for anything else. Good length strap and provides good cushion for camera. Standard length lens only, don't try to fit a medium to large zoom lens. Very good for taking to the beach or for nature walks."
4,Not His Best Work But ...,"There are some great songs on here. A few of the tracks sound a bit dated but the hit ""People Gotta Move"" never gets old for me. A must have for die hard Gino fans."
1,Not good.,"A gift, so I didn't choose it, but this was a disappointment. Poor expression, superfluous minor characters given far too much space, simplistic and predictable plot with Independence Day-size plot holes... oh dear. But it wasn't written for me, I guess. If you liked Cloud Atlas or anything by Neal Stephenson, this is not for you either."
3,Simplistic and not-so-hard SF,"SciFi should be a genre with truly original ideas. I enjoyed the start of the book and the analysis of seismic data pointing to something happening on the lunar surface.Unfortunately the rest of the book is a mixture of old ideas with very little realism. If you've seen the Replicators on Stargate and recall Jean Luc Picard saving Earth after being turned to a Borg, then you've been exposed to all the ideas this book has to offer.Of course a new blending of old ideas can seem fresh, but a combination of unimaginative plotting and one-dimensional characters makes for a quick, but not very compelling, read.If you're looking for a short action story, then this isn't bad at all, but if you're looking for thought-provoking ideas, look elsewhere."
2,Heart Cutters,"Ridiculous set of heart cutters. Two of them areexactly the same size and shape, plus there's onein the set that doesn't even resemble a heart....Not sure what it is. Only one small one in the setas well. Disappointed."
3,"I like it, but...","It's a good carrier, but I hate having skis in my hand. Makes it tough to walk. I'm looking for one I can wear on my back."
5,Love these,These holder straps are great and love them. They don't take up much room and can be put on very quickly. Will be purchasing more of these for our other skiis too.
4,carrier,"Makes carrying skis easier to use although they did not come with any directions and I was not home when they were first going to be used so my kids had a hard time figuring out how to use it. Once they figured it tout, it made getting to the slopes easier"
2,a bit disappointed,"Bought this for my daughter for a Stowe trip. The skis still seems to slide back and forth with this on. Also it's overpriced for what it's made of, in my opinion. It does do the basic job of holding your skis together, but I'm not sure it does that well enough."
5,Awesome!!!!,This is great!!!! My 8 year old can carry her skis with ease now!!! Just loop the skis and clip it!! Defiantly going to purchase another one!!!
5,Have been buying them for years,Great for everyday as well as entertaining. Proud to have them on our table!
4,good book,Am about half way through and love reading it. He tends to repeat the discipline message but that's what the books about right? It is easy to read and put into practice too.
5,Right on the mark,Guarendi is LOL funny (really) and provides super insightful advice on how to raise our kids--from toddler to teen--in this crazy world. This is a must-have book for all parents who are looking for real common-sense advice. I guarantee this will become a generational favorite.
4,Your standard news,"ASTM Standardization News is the official publication of ASTM International. Each issue covers a number of standardization-related issues such as research, testing, legal and governmental events, news, how-to, upcoming publications, etc. Articles are relatively brief but informative. An extensive calendar provides information for upcoming events such as technical committee meetings, special meetings, technical and professional training courses, and symposia."
3,Buyer beware!,"The title is very misleading. You must understand that you will only receive the workbook NOT the tape. I learned this by contacting my seller because I thought my order was incomplete. The seller told me that ""the title clearly states this is a workbook and manual."" To get the full benefit of the workbook why would anyone want to purchase the workbook and the tape manuel with no tape? Bienvenidos textbook and workbook comes highly recommended however. Good luck on finding the tape, I have not found it yet."
2,"Great game, when it works.....","Sim City 3K Unlimited is definately a great game, but it doesn't work correctly on many systems. This is the only PC game I have ever encountered that my CD drives scratch just by using it (mind you I have no clue why. I excanged it twice already). It only works correctly running windows 95 or 98, none of the 2000 editions (ME, 2000, XP). If you are a fan of the Sim City Franchise, buy this game and make sure you have the reccommended requirements for best gameplay. Otherwise, I wouldn't reccommend it."
2,Not As Good as the Previous One,"This version of the game is not as fun as the previous Sim City was. The only disasters in this one include, plague of locusts, tornado, space junk, UFO, toxic cloud, earthquake, whirlpool, and fire. You can't even recreate the 1938 New England hurricane in Providence, Rhode Island, on this one (I tried to). Either stick with the previous one, or get the latest version."
4,I forgot to mention,"I forgot to mention a drawback this game has, I have a very high tech computer and this game still takes a tremendous amount of time to load, you can proabably go cut the yard and then come back before it loads."
2,"4 stars for win 98, 0 for others","Like other reviewers, I've had problems with this game on both Win 2k and Windows XP. On 2k, the game installs and loads, but stalls on the first screen. On XP, the game installs but does not load.I originally bought this in China (legally) and thought that this may be the reason. I used to play it on a Windows 98 machine until that machine crashed, and I had to upgrade to 2k, and have not played it since.I also contacted EA Tech Support who insisted that this game is/was designed for Windows 98. They suggested I run the compatibility wizard but this was a failure.Why they're still selling this game escapes me. Maybe they've corrected things on later versions though.If you can get it to run, this really is a fun game. There are plenty of improvements from Sim City 2000 that I enjoyed, especially the more logical traffic and crime patterns, and the huge increase in map size.All in all though, don't buy this."
2,Not worth the money,"This game should be lowered by at least [amount]. This game takes up a lot of space on your hard drive. Sim City 3000 Unlimited isn't much different then Sim City 3000, the biggest difference of all is that its ... more exspensive. It runs slow on almost every computer, and it will sometimes have a few bugs. Example: every once in awhile me and my friend will see people walking across water where a bridge was a long time ago. This game also crashes very often. Now I'll explane the advantages:Sim City 3000 Unlimited has all the features of Sim City 3000 plus a bit more.You get to select from hundreds of new buildings, or make your own with the new Building Architect Plus tool.You get to chose from more disasters such as whirlpools, falling space junk, toxic clouds, and swarms of locust.Play 13 new scenarios or make your own.This game also includes famous landmarks including The Statue of Liberty.Take my advice just by Sim City 3000 there almost the same."
3,Not very unlimited,"This game is barely better than simcity 2000. It doesnt fix any of the major problems that could have been found in Simcity 2000. For example, in Simcity 2000, you cant biuld your biulding on diagonal roads. This problem isnt fixed in Simcity 3000. All they did was make the game more complex and harder on the processer. The game lags on my 1.2 ghz PC."
3,too hard,it would be extremly fun if i could get my city running but i go into debt and have to get a loan i cant pay off and then i keep getting loans and i still go into negatives before i can even pay it off.ive gone trough a good 10 citys and i still havnt gotten through a year with one before i have to give up.
1,sim city 3000 unlimited/,"if you have older version computer you could hardly open it as it takes so many memories of it, and i don't know how to build it as there is no manual or explaining of it , maybe somebody knows how, but sure you couldn't use it in older version computer as i said above. i believe it even takes you long time to build stuff."
5,Pretty Cool,"Umm,my freind has this game and it's graphics are awsome and the gameplay it to is awsome!I will get it this or next week:)Sincerily,Snow Leapord"
3,Nothing new,"Seems like this series has only updated it graphics from version to version. There is really nothing new here, other than updated graphics and some new city management responsibilities. I'm hearing similar things about SC4.This series is starting to burn it self out. Our mass media culture needs to move beyond the sim experience and into new realms. I have to agree with many others about playing games that mimic our lives.Please let us mimic with something more ground breaking. There's a platform game called Disaster Report which I did not like, but found myself wishing I could put myself into the action after a disaster in one of my Sim Cities. SC2K was heading in that direction with the drive around town mode, but it disapeared from the series all together, before it could be improved and added to. Too bad."
5,"Buy SC3KU, keep SC3K","This new version is good, and its new features are cool, but it's not worth the money to buy a whole other game when you already have Sim City 3000, the Unlimited version is not much different, they could've done a lot more for the time they had to develop it. My verdict: If you have Sim City 3000, don't buy it, if you want to buy a Sim City 3000, buy Unlimited."
3,Sim City 3000,"I like this game alot. i play it at my friends house only because she has windows 98. I think they should make a simcity 3000 for windows me. Sim city 3000 has really cool stuff. You can build your own city or use one thats already in use like Frankfurt, Germany or you can make your own city. If you get sick of your town and become bored,for fun you can desstroy it by a tornado earthquake and ufos and other cool stuff like that.The producer of this company should make it for all windows and if yuor making it for windows me your taking a long time."
2,SC5?,Will Sim City 5 ever come out EA Games!? I'm bored of Destinations already and love my city building games but one can only create the same city over and over with different designs before it gets to old!
2,Don't buy this version,"I love the SIM games, and SIM City 2000 was great - but this version was annoying, and was not improvement over 2000.Here is to hoping the next version will be great!"
2,"Don't play it again, Sim","It's probably good fun if you haven't seen Simcity 3000. And it's even better if the last thing you played was Simcity 2000. But if you already have Simcity 3000, don't go for it. It's nothing but a cheap relaunch from Maxis - they better think about real game improvements next time, rather than how to squeeze the last drop out of this game."
2,Must be for younger people!,"I was very anxious to get this game. To be frank, I just didn't get it !I had it up and running but I just couldn't figure out what to do. Hope you will have better luck."
1,SimCity 2000 in a pretty package,"Don't get me wrong Sim City 2000 was great I loved it. But this game is just Sim City 2000 with better graphics. Thats all I have to say. Im mad I bought it when I already have Sim City 2000. Oh yea you can not make farms, I tried, its imposible."
2,Boring game,"This game can be fun for a short period of time, but you don't really get to control it much. The best part of the whole game is the Building Architect. I would not recommend this game to people who like to control their games."
4,its great but it takes forever to load,"I believe that this game is totally better than Sim City 2000you can do almost anything you want. you could even be able to build the world trade center twin towers. For the memories. You get too see people in the game and the cars let alone everything else are 3D graphic. you have four new disasters like space junk plague of locusts and UFO (sort of an update on Monster) and my favorite the is the whirlpoolLet alone you have fantastic gaming effects...for those of you who are too overwhelmed by the 3D graphics of 3000 you can play the very original sim city classic that started it allthe only problem is that it takes forever to load on my computer i wait for about five minutes just to load the city.Other than that, it is completly fun..."
3,Great game in its day; rather old now.,"This was a great game back in its day. However, it is old and dated now. It was a vast improvement over SimCity 2000 and the original SimCity, offering larger cities and maps and improved graphics and other details.For all the reviewers who are being so negative, look at the system requirements. This game was designed for Windows 95 and 98, not 2000 or XP. Most games like that will not run properly under 2000 or XP (if at all). For those of you with 2000 or XP, I recommend SimCity 4 (Rush Hour or Deluxe Edition) instead.Technology marches on, and it is critical to verify that your system meets the requirements of the software programs (and understanding that old programs may no longer work on newer PCs and operating systems)."
1,Addicting,"This game is great! You get to be the mayer of your own created city. Many probelms accure and you run out of money fast. The only thing that puts this sown to 4 stars, is it acn be frustrating and is VERY HARD to get started. It is much easier to use a starter town (recomendation if you are planning on buying this game.)"
5,Brilliant!,"Sim City 3000 Unlimited is SO VERY COOL! It is one of the best games ever made, the graphics are incredible, and the power you have over your city is remarkable. A great gift idea!"
3,"Fun and better then the original, but gets somewhat boring.","I loved Sim City 3000. I adored it. I played it everyday. For about 2 weeks. And then I didn't play it. I liked it, but it really got too boring for me. Now when I heard of SimCity 3000 addon I got excited. I learned about this rather early, beacuse I had some connections with the company Maxis and my website, which closed down, called MaxisNews. It was hard to wait, as it looked really good, much better then the original. But when I got it, a lot of the features were pretty useless, such as the Ticker maker. The disasters were pretty cool, and it seemed a lot more detailed, but, I would rather play The Sims anyday. Oh yeah, by the way, Maxis is releasing The Sims Multiplayer soon. Better check it out! Get full details at ModernEmpire.com"
1,Unlimited ? Except for system requirements !!,"Simcity 3000 unlimited does NOT support Windows 2000, Me, NT.Someone still running Windows 95 or Windows 98 interested by my copy ? Mr Flintstone, maybe ?"
2,"Nice Graphics, Same Gameplay","SimCity 3k has great graphics hands-down, but if you've played oyther SimCitys then you've played SimCity 3k. The gameplay is identical with minor tweaks here and there, but with most of the hype that went into this game left out. You can't tweak individual buildings, or really get into the management of a city as you would like to. Once again things like subways and buses operate without an revenue generation (what country in the world gives away public transportation?), thus tying your economic fate to basically taxes (which are a simple model as well) and some policies. Graphics are great, but the gameplay is the same as before."
2,It would probably be great - if you can figure it out!,"I bought Sim City 3000 Unlimited thinking it would be the best game I'd ever played. I can't begin to tell you how wrong I was. The game comes with no manual, and it took me 2 hours just to figure out how to get power to the houses, and even longer to find out how to put in ""on ramps"" from the roads to highways.IF you can figure it out, you might actually have some fun. But since there's no manual that even briefly describes the game, doing this might be somewhat of a challenge.Take my advice - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,this game is OK.......,"when i first saw sim city 4 come out i wanted to buy it but it was way to expensive so i thought let me buy sim city 3000 unlimited. well i can tell u this its great game well thought out and everyhting but the graphivcs r not that great andif u delete somethin it costs u money.Also how do u make money but now since its '03 and u can still build the twin toers its a little odd seeing the in the sky of ur town. well im out maybe thell cme up wit greater games other then any ""sim "" ga,mes"
4,Slightly More Intricate Than Past Games. Has Potential,"For everyone who loves the simulation games like SimCity, this edition will not disappoint as it expands the options that each designer can use to develop their city. The potential for more diverse building types and a more interesting development scenario add to flavor of the game. In reality though, 3000 Unlimited is nearly identical to the most previous editions to the game, merely adding some interactive features.If you are a big fan of SimCity and want to get even more in depth with your cities, go ahead and buy it, the price is right. If you were easily bored with SimCity 2000 or 3000, maybe you should try another scenario game. For someone who has never played the game before, it's your call. Either buy it now to test it out or wait a year or two until the newest edition is released (I assume there will be one). Most likely the next edition will be different than 3000 Unlimited."
4,Not necessarily worth paying for a whole new game!,"This game is not really worth paying for a hole new game when all you are really getting is an upgrade. As far as playing the game, it is really not very different from Sim City 3000. But still very cool."
2,redundancy compilation,"This one is not dedicated to any die hard deep purple fans, but only for youngsters who love them for the very first time. Some songs are founded in COME HELL OR HIGH WATER album.If you love DP and its relatives bands, pls buy the original albums. Keep away from this redundancy cd compilation.Deep Purple Dramatician O. Jon"
4,Begin At the Beginning,"A critical first step in your Blues education. An excellent read, but may contain more information than the casual Blues fan wants to know. What I would call a ""serious"" blues text. Along with a detailed search for the source of the blues, there are fascinating portions that illuminate racial divides and prejudices. Check out Lomax's adventures in Memphis, told in first person, for a disturbing portrait of ""cracker law enforcement""...seems almost unbelievable...almost."
2,Not essential,"Who or what is Alan Lomax? Some self opinionated person who seems to have made field recordings for which he seems to have paid very little.In other words a white man exploiting blacks and no different to whoever.I've never read this book and don't think I need to do-I just read the reviews on here which sometimes quotes his asides like ""I wish I was a black man on a Saturdey night""-not only an unecesarry remark but a pretty terible think to say when there's no need for it.If he had just written an account of the blues and slavery without poking his poke in the book would have rung differently.Apparantly he has to have a go at white musicians who played the blues.You're better off reading Bill Wyman's book"
2,"Skip the Book, Buy the CD Instead","Alan Lomax's contributions to American music are enormous. His field recordings and archives are the foundation of the American Songbook. But he's a terrible writer, and this book is practically unreadable. There are some great interviews with Delta singers and musicians, but they're embedded in page after page of Lomax's lousy prose. If you really want to know about this music, skip the book and buy the CD, which is a phenomenal collection of blues, gospel & work songs Lomax recorded in the South in the 1930s and 40s. The music says it all much more authentically and eloquently than Lomax's words can possibly convey. God bless him, but he should have stuck to the tape recorder and thrown his typewriter away."
4,LOWEPRO IS A BRAND YOU CAN TRUST,"This is my third Lowepro camera bag for all the other camera I had in the past and now. This looks good and very well made inside and out. I bought this one in particular for my Canon SX210 IS. I am looking for something that would fit other things like batteries, memory cards, USB cable, charger, lens clenaer, etc. Well, there is a separate compartment for the memory and batteries. The main compartment is too big for my camera alone. I wished it had one of those dividers with velcro that you can move around. My previous Lowepro's have this on them. With this one, I can't put my other accessories as it might scratch my LCD. It is a very good camera bag, just make sure it is the right size for your camera. This camera would accomodate a small SLR camera."
5,"Tiina Nunnally, THE translator of Norwegian, Swedish and Danish Authors extraordinaire","When first read, I enjoyed the Charles Archer translations of KRISTINLAVRANSDATTER. Tiina Nunnally's work makes this book come to life. Thankyou!Readers, should read also ""THE UNKNOWN SIGRID UNDSET"" (ISBN 1586420216)mostly translated by and with an excellent introduction by Tiina Nunnally.The author, Sigrid Undset is one of the best of all time! (So far, of course). Dag Stomberg, my date 2009."
1,Am I alone.,"I have been reading for 45 years in 7 Languages and absolutely love good Literature. I adored War & Peace,everything written by Marquez (my favorite)I like Proust and Joyce but I have arrived at page 450 of this novel and I hate it.It seems written by a religiously obsessed woman. The whole novel is a constant whining,tears and sorrow. I certainly can understand the time-period given that I am an Archeologist and European. From the first 50 pages I already knew that I was not going to like this but I keep on dragging myself from page to page hoping that it will take a different turn. I must be the only person on the planet thinks this way. I usually don't write reviews but I just had to get this of my heart."
3,sender's Review,Sender neglected to reveal that the book was torn where the inside binding attached to the cover. I wish I had known that.
2,very poor quality of paper and poor look of the book,"The content is great, and I was buying this book as a present to my customer, but the look and the quality of paper is very poor. The paper is brown, not white, and edges of pages are uncut. Half of pages are wider than other, and stick out from under the cover. It looks like it was printed and binded in some small shop, manually, and at a very low quality. Very disappointing experience. IT IS DEFINITELY NOT A DELUXE EDITION, AS IT WAS PRESENTED."
1,Kristin Lavransdatter: (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition),"Reading is one of my favorite things to do - I read at every spare minute - even walking & on commercials. That said, I love to find a lo-o-o-ong novel that immerses me in the characters & story, that I can't put down but dread finishing because it will be over. Kristin Lavransdatter was NOT one of those books. I rarely put a book down without finishing it, no matter how much I hate it because I have to find out how it ends. I struggled & plodded through this book. It wasn't boring, & the writing wasn't bad. It was just far too long for no reason. Kristin was naive & silly, even into old age it seemed. Erlund was selfish & stupid & frustrating - it was difficult to feel any real concern or interest in their story. If the book had been cut in half & told from the viewpoint of Simon Darre, I would have enjoyed it more."
5,The story of an ordinary woman who becomes a saint,"This is one of the great books of the Christian West. It is the story of a Swedish woman, married and with children, and how her response to the grace of God from childhood through adulthood to old age leads her to become a saint -- not a plastic one, but a flesh and blood one. I read this book once a year. It is perpetually marvelous."
5,"Sweeping, beautiful, moving","This is probably the greatest book I have ever read. It's over 1,000 pages long, but it's gripping throughout. It's ok to forget specific events, because the book is more about who the characters are than what they do. It's the life-story of Kristin Lavransdatter, a noblewoman in 14th century Norway. I really came to feel for her and for all the many characters in the book.The language is very medieval, which I found beautiful, and only occasionally hard to understand. Also, the Catholic Church and Faith are not represented cynically, but, instead, quite matter-of-factly (which was rather refreshing).After reading this book, I feel like I view life differently. My whole outlook towards the everyday (which was what this book was about) is changed. I now see, more than ever, the beauty and joy of such things as family and faith. I am very glad to have read this book."
2,Review of this Translation,"Kristin Lavransdatter is an amazing book. This review is about Tiina Nunally's translation. Although it is contemporary English, and is easier to read than the older translation, it is too slick. It reads like a low-quality bestseller. I much prefer the older translation, with its idiosyncracies, and old-fashioned words. It has more dignity and places the reader more appropriately in the Middle Ages."
5,the best,I thought this book was the best adventure I have ever read. I wish they would make a movie of it. Totally fascinating
1,Can't use if hard,"Ordered 2 tubes the delivery time was good, used the tubes right away the first tube worked fine but only got half the caulk out of the second tube the rest of the caulk had already hardened inside the cartridge."
2,Okay for a beginner,"I found this book rather...well...lame. To me, and this is just me, the information was nothing that you could not find on most basic websites. I would look elsewhere."
5,Patterns in Nature by Peter Stevens,"This is a book I read back in the early 80's and lost track of it. I've been refering to ideas I learned in it, such as why nature chooses certain types of patterns. These ideas relate to organizational design, such as the natural branching structures in companies. It's been great to re-read it and get new ideas. It's a fairly technical book, with explanations that are scientific and mathematical. It's worth the effort to get through it. It also has beautiful photos that show how certain patterns are repeated in various parts of nature."
5,Mangione's Best Vinyl & No CD Available?,"When every imaginable genre of music from the vinyl days has a CD on the market why is Mangione's ""Bellavia"" not available in this format? The album wins a Grammy, but isn't worthy of a CD? The best cut is ""Listen To The Wind."" Gerry Niewood's Tenor Saxophone on this almost 7-minute track is worth a CD offering by itself."
4,An Eye for an Eye,"I disagree with one of the other reviewers that this book is a ""light read."" It is assuredly not in the comic vein of most of Trollope's novels and it is, if anything, ""heavy"" indeed! It is cast in the mold of a classical tragedy with the hero conflicted between his duty to his family and his duty to the woman he loves. Trollope dearly loves to place his characters in such a bind, but this time it doesn't have a happy ending as is so often the case. It is thus atypical of Trollope's novels,though it does reveal the author's romantic preference for love over duty. In many ways this may be his most powerful statement for that preference as love does not win out in the end. I strongly recommend it, but as with one of the other reviewers, not as a first taste of Trollope. The book is quite different from most of his many other novels."
1,"Overlooked, for a reason","I love Trollope, but this one is in a different, much lower, league from the Barsetshire or Palliser novels. It has a skeleton of a plot, with no subplots or secondary characters of interest."
4,ALMOST...Platinum,"Of course you can never please EVERYBODY with ""best of"" collections.And this IS a darn good collection. HOWEVER,...It would have been perfection to have included the following songs:1) I'M A LITTE BIT LONESOME2) I DON'T WANNA MAKE LOVE (with anyone else but you)(if this song does'nt get you in ""the mood"" ..you're clinically dead)3) THE ROOM AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS (ditto)This would have made it KILLER Platinum! But I give credit for at least finally putting more of Eddie's great songs out there on CD. It's about time. Now a double- CD GOLD collection would be nice too!(I know,..we're just never satisfied!)!"
3,Rabbitt Platinum Collection,My vinyl was scratched so couldn't burn a CD - really liked this album so just had to purchase the CD. Good tunes!
3,Wasn't what I expected,Pretty but not what I expected by Sister Canteloupe. Not very funny. Some parts were funny but not as good as I have seen some of her material.
3,For fans of the Computer edition,"Most of the monsters, items and levels are quite similar to the cd game. However, if you are looking for a role-playing challenge, find a different adventure. This game crams treasure down the party's throats. It is earned, but only because this is just one long hack and slash adventure."
2,Really not useful,"This book is a confusing waste of money. For starters, my own mistake was thinking that it was 3.0 3.5, it is 2.0. Second, this book is ""DIABLO II"" but it is actually just characters from DIABLO II and the STORY line of DIABLO I, which is crappy considering they stole the monsters from DIABLO II also. This book is also ridden with typos and innacuracies. Please save yourself time and money and buy a different book."
2,Beekman's World meets Carmen Sandiego,"This was not a good title for me. I got it back when I was in college(2001?)hence the VHS format. In any format this was a good attempt but fell flat. I wish I could have reviewed the product before I purchased it so that I could see how frenetic the material was. Anyone who has gotten to the point of studying Differential Equations has some decent math under their belt and some discipline to study. A few gimmicks or tricks might be necessary but not as many as they have in the video. It is very distracting and at times hard to keep up with. It tries too hard to be fun with a crazy storyline and a lot of flashing lights and effects. I didn't learn anything from the video, nor did it clarify what I already knew. It was an amusing diversion but not as helpful as I thought it'd be."
3,Okay as a supplement,"If you're looking for insight into the material or instructive computer animation of graphs or moving illustrations that illuminate the mathematical concepts, then by all means look elsewhere. If you're looking for a dry textbook review of the material read in a funny voice, then you've hit the jackpot!"
4,Enjoyable pop album,"This accomplished 1977 album has long been difficult to find. It opens with the soaring (Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher And Higher, which is followed by the swinging and swaying The Way You Do The Things You Do. The slow and melancholy Boz Scaggs composition We're All Alone was a hit, I think, and she elegantly covers I Don't Want To Talk About It.One of my favorites is her version of Words by the Gibb brothers, and she renders Sam Cooke's Good Times in an appealing way. The Kris Kristofferson song Who's To Bless And Who's To Blame gets a rousing treatment over some really funky music.All the tracks are enjoyable, including the powerful rock ballad Southern Lady and the closing track, a cover of Neil Sedaka's The Hungry Years, a yearning ballad. All in all, Anytime Anywhere is an appealing pop album with many a soulful moment."
4,"Solid, if somewhat dated, treatment of content analysis.","This is another one of those great little Sage books which provide solid overviews of various areas of social science methodology in under a hundred pages. Like many applied researchers, I have a number of them on the shelf next to my desk. Robert Weber does a thorough job of introducing the reader to the basic approach and methods of content analysis. My only criticism is that this 1990 book could use a third edition by now. Readers interested in a longer and more current treatment might try Riffe, Lacy & Fico (1998). A good and useful book, though. I am glad that I purchased it."
5,Just what I needed,"Of course it is short, but that's its appeal. I just needed it in order to write some paragraphs on the reliability and validity of my research. The sections that I've found were clear, to the point and informative. So, in a way, I've spent 16$ for two pages of my writing on the validity of my research. If it gets published, than it is money well spent. If not, than I'll buy a more expensive book and dive into details. Five stars for brevity!"
3,More than a simple introduction...,"If you would like to know a bit more about content analysis strategies, have a look at this book. Weber wrote more than a simple introduction. Altought he introduces some techniques quite useful in this domain, he did not give a really detail application of these different techniques. Qualitative researches must have a look. esy to read."
4,nice easygoing jazz,IS you like grant Green this should be in your collection. He did not make much albums with Sonny Clark wich is a shame.
4,Grant Green Guitar Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark,I love old school Jazz Guitar from the 50's & 60's with great playing! This double CD fills the bill!
3,It is a wonderful book.,Does anybody know whether the book has a students' manual or solutions to the exercises of each chapter.
2,Looking for an Elvis discography book? Don't buy this!,"This book did not add anything to my collection of Elvis books at all. Yes, there are the standard issues of Elvis records in color, as well as many bootlegs featured. BUT, there are too many records missing to make this book the least complete. Many records are only featured with pictures, no track-listing, why? This information is very easy to obtain on the net. Seems research was very poor.The bootlegs featured, are from the author's own collection. There are great color photos of the covers, and tracklistings on most of the records. But why limit the number of recorde to his own collection? Again, has there been made a research to complete the book with more material? No.If you don't have a discography book with Elvis' records, you could buy it. If you have any before, this won't add much. If you don't have any bootleg discography, this book could be worth buying.There are far too many much better books on the market."
5,She Makes it Better,"Holly Cole's voice and words went straight through me. I never knew she existed and was introduced to the CD when traveling in a country far from home. I made love that wasn't love to this music, but it made it better. Her emotional voice and deep understanding of the songs indeed make her versions in several cases better than the originals. She doesn't have to choose between jazz and pop. She can just come in and softly claim space."
5,She's the best!!,"I think Holly Cole is a great singer, I have her cd Dark Dear Heart and Temptation, I'd recomend the cd any day, you can usually hear her on the radio with her new song 'I've just seen a face'."
4,It's a keeper,"I bought this CD for ""World seems to come and go"", which was co-written by Jim White. That song has a signature Jim White feel to it. While the rest of the album is very different from the so called southern gothic genre White is often lumped into, song structures, arrangements, etc. begin to have some similarities to those of Jim White, especially on repeated listens.Cole veers more toward jazz, and godforbid I use the words, ""easy listening"", but she also seems to have quite a lot of depth, and there are lots of nuances and different secrets to discover.I had never heard of Holly Cole till recently, but I understand she's just about a mainstream household name. Don't let either ""mainstream"" or ""household"" fool you, because just below the surface, there's lots of little twisted guitars, sultry sax solos, and half whispered voices semi hidden in the mix.This is great as background or mood music, but also great for closer listening."
3,Not as good as Temptation,"Holly Cole hovers on the borderline between jazz and pop, which gives this album definitely something incoherent. Her voice is recorded too close-mike, which leads me to think that her normal voice is too weak to hear above the instruments. The choice of songs gives me the impression that she can't decide between pop and country."
5,"""How To Make A Fortune In Finer's Fees by Jack Payne",Even though the book was written before computer age in 1981 the principles are still valid. He has a special form that you can give to companies so you can help them. He has letters that you can adapt for your finders business as well as two contracts you can use and adapt.He gives many example showing how finders found success with many different items.It is a must for finders. It has everything you need to start.
2,received older edition,"I thought I was receiving the 1987 edition, but when it arrived I found that it was the 1973 edition. I will say the seller never said it was the 1987 edition, nor did he say it was the 1973 edition."
3,Better performance on TV LIVE!,"It sounded great, and if i'm not mistaken, broadcasted on 95.5 KLOS FM. So, went to Wallecks Music City in Lakewood, Calif., and bought the album. Not the same, to bad. Video machines back then, don't think they had Bata in 1974, where real expensive. P.S. The guy that was saying something about that Red Cap he was waring, SO WHAT! I'm mean what's your problem about that anyway? This was the time when Alice Copper, Black Sabbath, and I do believe that new Group Kiss was just breaking out at that time. Maybe Rick done that because HE seen what was going on in the future! The bottom line is this! Rick and Ion ( Yep, that's His true Born Name! ) couldn't stand each other! A lot of FIGHTS AND PROBLEMS, and I know your mad about that, but that's how it goes! COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,mediocre totally dissapointing,"Spanx super footless bodyshaping pantyhose looks great , they can make an average outfit become cute and sexy But the quality is mediocre after been gently worn for 3 times they ripped . I'm am still a spanx customer but not for this particular item. Save your money the spanx super footless bodyshaping pantyhose are expensive and mediocre all that is has going for it shelf is the sheer in the bottom."
4,still have,"Not to be used as a pry bar in any way as I broke off all items that can be used in this ""wrong"" way. The pliers have held up nicely though"
4,neat design,"This item is not as sturdy as a Leatherman, but the wrist-action allows for quicker opening."
2,not easy to use,Someone was saying the tool was nice and not expensive to own. It turned out a disappointment.
5,UFO Encounters,What a great item. I have waited a long time to get this. I will watch it again and again.
3,First in an entertaining series..,"""Murder"" by Harold Adams is the first book in the Wilcox series. The series is set around a ne're do well who does odd jobs in his parents' hotel. He is an ex-con, with a penchant for attracting women, trouble or both. One of Wilcox's enemies is found murdered in a barn, and Wilcox tries to get to the bottom of it before it attracts bad attention upon him. There are a lot of suspects in this murder. Is it the brother of a ""loose"" waitress who wants to defend his sister's honor? The sleazy butcher who idolized the victim? Or the boyfriend of the dead guy's daughter? The conclusion is good, with a noir feel to it. This book is also rare in paperback, so it is mostly found in large type."
4,"Cotton Sateen Sheets, Cal King",These are nice sheets and the price was great! $20 for a Cal King set that is soft and washes well. I buy all my sheets from Amazon!
1,BORING,Teacher at a chalkboard. I bought this thinking it was a more creative way to teach math. My white board is better then this DVD. HUGE waste of mooney. THE KIDS HATED IT. One even begged for work just to get it off the TV. Threw it away.
1,SHOULD BE CALLED Stepping Stones to Boring,"Pathetic! This is so awful, it can't even be put into words. What a waste. How is it possible that someone thought this DVD was good enough to sell?!? And then make a whole series of them?!? Ugh."
1,gothabilly gone bad,"Unimaginitive drivel. These guys are ALL image and no content. The simple, stupid magic of the Misfits is not present here, and the musical talent and charm of the Cramps is not even approached. Much like the movie the band named this sad debut after, this one is not even kitch enough to be cool."
1,It's a shame,"I've seen this band on several occassions and have been a little dissappointed each time. They're still about the nicest guys in the world so I thought I'd give the disc a chance. I wish I hadn't, it falls a lot shorter than they're already tired live show. I wish there were more bands in this genre who brought new ideas to the table instead of recycling old ones poorly."
1,Really Bummed,I bought this because the description said that it came with playing cards and poker chips. I did not receive them. I was very Disapointed.
4,Very Genesis-y,"This album reflects the writing and instrumentation of 1972 - 1976 Genesis with ex-Marillion lead singer Fish-like vocals, Steve Hackett-ish guitar, Banks-ish keyboards, ect.,. This is an interesting if looking for more Genesis music. ""Late For Dinner"" tips its hat to ""Supper's Ready""...nice."
4,Sports-readin' fun!,"I'm no Redskins fan --- I'd rather die first! Warner loves the 'skins and it comes up regularly. That aside, this is a fine read for anyone who enjoys the man and the work he does. I've always liked Warner's ""schtick"" and so I also enjoyed the read. He's one of the best reasons these days for tuning in Imus In The Morning. Keep up the good work, Warner; we're watching and listening (and reading)."
2,If you bet that this would be a good book...YOU LOST!,"Warner Wolf has been a New York institution but anyone who thinks this book is great should be put in an institution. There are over 100 chapters but most of them are anywhere between half a page and 2 pages. Some of the chapters are on ridiculous subjects. It's as if Warner just wrote down the first thought that popped into his head. The book has no structure. He's not a dinosaur but some of his views are a tad outdated. It's like spending an evening with someone who tells stories that he thinks are hysterical but aren't really. Thankfully, I didn't have to pretend to laugh. I should have read Warner's first book ""Gimme a Break"" but it's out of print. Too bad this book isn't out of print."
3,gypsy davey,"Gypsy Davey was a pretty good book about a kid named Davey and how hard his life was. His dad isn't around and his mom drinks a lot and has a lot of boyfriends. His sister takes care of him mostly when he is little, but then when she is a teenager she has a baby. This story talks a lot about all the responsibilities that Davey has during his life, but it also talks about how the way he was raised helps him know how he wants to be as an adult. He wants to be a good father and have a good life."
4,Nice Review of Past and Present,"I enjoyed this book. Some of the pictures do not compare well because they were taken at different angles or from a different side of the street. Nevertheless, this is a great book. I found lots of stuff to compare. Native Chicagoans, who take an interest in the city, will like it. I purchased it for my brother for Christmas...liked it so much I purchased one for myself."
3,"Nice Historic Photographs, So So modern Photographs, Filler Writing.","I own the book ""Chicago, then and Now"" but am not sure I would recommend it, simply because it seems rather hastily put together. The old time ""then"" photographs are for the most part, quite nice, well framed shots, while the ""now"" shots are mostly terrible. It is often difficult to tell if the new shot is really of the same location, simply because it is taken from a different location and looking in a completely different direction than the original. The authors don't seem to even try to get the shots from the same angle/location or take much time to set up a decent photograph. This series could be done so much better. The text is mostly just filler between the shots with no real insight, though this can be forgiven, as it is something of a ""coffee table"" book. Nice concept, not the best execution."
4,perfect for gifts,we use these as client and referral gifts and they work great! people get to learn a little about our city and they're perfect as coffee table books.
4,Just short of terrific,"I read ""The Drowner"" a couple of months ago, enjoyed it immensely, recommended it to my wife, and planned to write a glowing review. But, now, I have to think hard to remember it. As I think about it, details come back, and I smile remembering (what's a ""drowner?"", the idea of the aquaduct, that French guy!). A great book imprints itself, so one recalls it without effort, and this book isn't there. But it's a fine novel nonetheless, certainly much better than most of the bestselling tripe available -- it's just not quite as good as I'd hoped it would be.""The Drowner"" appears to be unavailable to the US audience today, and that's a shame. It's probably not worth a whole lot of effort to track down; but, if you run across a copy, it's worth picking up. Then, tell me I'm wrong."
5,Very interested and heavily boorowed from book on Atari,No doubt if you have read Game over by David Sheff you will have allready absorbed a bit of this book since he liberally used it as a reference. A very good read for those seriously interested in the biginnings and eventual horrific end of Atari's reign.
2,Better books are available,"I probably own most books written on the video game history and this one is so full of historical inaccuracies and poor writing that I would not recommended adding to your book shelf unless you like to collect whatever the quality (by the way, I wish someone would have reviewed it before I spent my money!) Better written books exist such as ""The Ultimate History of Video Games."" A new book that probably will appeal more to software developers or technical geeks is ""Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System."" The book ""Phoenix: The Fall & Rise of Videogames"" is excellent but hard to get. I always check out the Rolenta Press web site - they publish some interesting books on the video game industry of yore."
1,The Zap! book is a fail - go here: [...],"I remember reading this book when it first came out back in the 80's and loved it. Then I got educated on Atari and found out that not only is the content of this book wrong, but after speaking with many former Atari employees, many supposedly interviewed for this book, they all came back and said they either were never interviewed or what they said and what the author wrote was completely different. The book glosses over very important area's and misses on most points. Looking back at it now, this book is more damaging to Atari history then helpful, it's false on much of its content. I'm going to add in a shameless plug here, go to [...] to see what REAL Atari history is all about."
1,Missing the point...,"I think she is missing the point of being a Roman Catholic. How can you practice a faith when you disagree with its main tenets? The simple answer is that you cannot. You cannot adhere to a religion when your heart is not in it. The Church rejects homosexuality, artificial birth control and women's ordination because those things are contrary to living a sanctified Catholic life (for many theological reasons which Dr. Ryan clearly is unaware of). If you want watered down theology, weak religious adherence, and a domesticated version of Jesus Christ, you are missing out on the beauty of what it really means to be a Roman Catholic."
2,Catholic Doctrine based on ecumenicism and popular opinion??,"Dr. Ryan is articulate and clearly well educated. She understands the issues facing American Catholics today and proposes solutions that originate in her deep and abiding faith. But the problem is that her approach and solutions are relativistic and, I must say, completely misguided. Infallibility of the ex chathedra Pope hurts ecumenicism so the Church should give it up? Gays and Lesibians have loving relationships so their marriages should be sacramentally allowed? Celibacy is causing a shortage of priests so it should be discontinued? Dr Ryan's logic is a slippery slope where the Catholic Church would give up any doctrine that is non-ecumenical or socially unacceptable in modern American society. I suppose Dr Ryan will next be calling for the Church to recant Mary's Immaculate Conception and Assumption. Perhaps Dr. Ryan would make a happy Episcopalean?"
1,Only for those who think moral relativism is a good thing.,"Another disgruntled Catholic who wants the church to change to fit her personal agendas. Eternal Truth no longer matters; pleasing ourselves, instead of God, is what would make this author happy. ""Feel good"" Catholicism is an outdatd, '60's concept that has been repeatedly shown not to work and this book sounds like a re-hash of those dated ideas. The Catholic Church never changes to fit the current era. Those that don't understand that know little of the Church and of history. That is part of the beauty of the Catholic Church. Don't buy her book but do pray for her."
1,read book at your own risk,If you buy this book you are wasting your money. Save your cash and invest in a copy of the Catechism.
4,"Nice, a little small though.","This Camera bag is a good one. It works well with the Canon Rebel 2000 and the big pouch is large enough for the camera and the lens that comes with it. The flap pouch is good for things like lens tissue and other small things. And the pouch under the flap is great for glasses or film. The one problem that I have with it is that it is a little small. There is not much room for extra film, and I find the mesh poches almost worthless. I would give this 4.5 stars if I could."
3,Why bother with Bluetooth?,"I am a photographer and use a Wacom tablet at work. There I use the smaller corded tablet. My husband was trying to be thoughtful and bought me this one to use at home, figuring that since it was bigger and more expensive it would be better. I LOVE using a tablet and the tablet works just fine, but the Bluetooth function is a pain in the neck. It seems I'm troubleshooting almost every time I use it, and I have yet another battery charger cable to keep track of. Unless you have a reason to need a cordless tablet, why bother? USB is so much easier. Buy the smaller tablet - the pen even seems a little more substantial."
5,COMPUTER TABLET,THIS IS FANTASTIC! I HAD NO PROBLEM INSTALLING IT ON MY MAC OR PC. THE PERFORMANCE FAR EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS. IT'S VERY EASY TO USE. GET ONE!
1,Worthless!,"Never did work. The pen would only work in the upper left fourth part the drawing area in Photoshop and several other programs I tried it in. I will be packing this up and returning it. The mouse wouldn't work at all.The Wacom website is worthless too. No decent troubleshooting pages. I tried sending them an email.If there were an option for zero stars, that's what I'd give it!"
1,Did not work :(,"I got the tablet today, plugged it in and saw that the tablet does not hold a charge. Amazon sold me a faulty tablet that does not hold a charge. I cannot use it, and needs to be returned to Wacom. I have played with a working version of this tablet and they are fantastic, but I just happened to get a dud. Thanks to Wacom they will be sending a replacement one. Just a bit miffed I got one that was broken from the start."
5,Haven't slept for a week :),"From the minute I have installed my Wacom Graphire, I can't tear myself away. It's responsive and easy to use, simple to install, and the bluetooth connection means I'm not limited by a cable when I decide how to hold and use it. The size is easy to work with - small enough to hold comfortably, and big enough to be accurate as you work.Graphics programs such as photoshop and painter also utilize the pen nib pressure sensitivity, making lines thicker the harder you press - just like artists media in the real world. The fact that the back end is an eraser (!) is so intuitive and logical, the work flows naturally.It's also very good-looking .. and even comes with a template so you can customize your tablet.I would recommend every designer/artist get one of these toy/tools."
1,update: WACOM FIXED IT: re: What Happened?,"update: company replaced the pen for the cost of shipping, now it works perfectly. initial ""upset"" review: I've had this tablet for a few months. Once I figured out to put the tablet to sleep before my powerbook (used to keep it waking up), I was loving that I could bring this everywhere with me. Although, quite suddenly, there has been a breakdown in performance of the pen. I've tried everything (reinstalling software, a new tip for the pen, getting updates for my computer, turning bluetooth off and on, redoing permissions, throwing out preferences.) The pen is totally unusable as it will start working and then stop (mouse works fine, but I don't need a mouse!) I reached out to Wacom, but they haven't responded. I'm back to my USB wacom, which has been reliable for 7 + years. I second that this bluetooth tablet isn't ready for release for the less patient, its way too buggy!"
4,"Love the pen, hate the mouse","I bought this set thinking I could get a bluetooth mouse and drawing pad combined, but was disappointed to find out that the mouse HAS to be used with the pad in order to work (it has no bluetooth capability by itself). When you use the mouse, it interferes with the default mouse speed settings, and really ends up being screwy. FORTUNATELY, I love the drawing pad SO much that I will just go and buy a sepparate bluetooth mouse and trash this one.The drawing pad and pen are sensational."
3,Good idea --- but a little awkward,"Pros: They are very easy to keep clean. Accidentally dip the corner in your dish? It washes right off! No need to launder.Cons: They take some getting used too. The silicone is a bit stiff, so bending it to get a good grip on something can take a little practice."
5,Great Pot Holder,"I love my pot holders. They are perfect because even if they get wet you can quickly wipe them off and use them again. I've gotten more than one steam burn from my regular pot holders because I didn't notice that they had soaked up some water. I've had similar problems with holding a pot for a long time with them but my regular pot holders have the same issue. For that type of thing I'd have to recommend a pair of oven mitts. They do take a bit of getting used to but if you hold them in a diamond shape as opposed to flat they are a little easier to work with. So while I wouldn't throw away my old pot holders, I highly recommend these for your kitchen collection."
3,Pot Holder Just OK,I found this potholder difficult to bend and much prefer cloth-type pot holders as I don't have large hands.
2,"does its job, but the price not worth it.","Nice opaque white silicone pieces, but too thin to use as trivet.It was too costly (~ USD 12) and the price is nowhere worth it. Same holder in other colors are available at USD 5. Another listing in amazon had a price of USD 5 with 4$ shipping. So they include the shipping in the price itself ?Given price to utility ratio, nothing more than a 2 star."
2,Awkward,"I don't like these pot holders at all. They are too small and not flexible enough, so I inevitably burn myself whenever I take something from the oven. I have gone back to cloth pot holders and will use these as trivets. I had the same problem with another silicone type pot holder I bought at the same time, so I will not buy any of these types again."
4,Really great! Thick and cute!,"Very thick and sturdy, we use it as a pot holder to take things out of the oven as well as a table protector under hot casserole and serving dishes."
2,"Orange ""trivet""","I'm not in agreement that these are good pot holders, not at all. They are clumsy and awkward and not even easy to hold on to. That is not a good thing when one is holding a burning hot pan! They slip and slide and tho easy to clean (and normal pot holders are THAT difficult to clean?), they might as well call them orange TRIVETS.Not my cuppa tea..."
1,"A good idea, disappointing in use","These silicone pot holders are indeed brightly colored, easy to wash in the dishwasher, and protective even when wet. They are also clumsily stiff at the same time as they are slippery, the net result being a miserable failure in the kitchen. They are useful for protecting a counter from a hot pot, but not for picking the hot pot up."
5,"Never mind ""One in a Million Girls""","To some of you younger folks, The Tubes are that horrible band that did ""One in a Million Girls,"" and other truly dreadful pop tunes that you would, quite rightly, rather have your eyes poked out before hearing again.This is different. This is their first album, and is worth twice the price for White Punks On Dope alone. The rest of the album isn't too bad either."
5,Killer Memories,"This album never grows old. Every time I hear it it's like the first time. Ahhhh, the 70,s,the recreational pharmasutical of my choice, and W.P.O.D blasting. The good old days......."
5,Oustanding from start to finish,"Despite the opinion of some reviewers favouring the original side 2 of the album (the latter four songs are admittedely incredibly strong, the least known being the superb moralising rifferama of 'Boy Crazy'), the open four cuts are essential listening too, from the amazing wah-wah guitar over orchestra coda of the blissful 'Haloes' to the SF gargle of 'Space Baby' (worthy of Hawkwind in Calvert mode) not to mention the insane 'Malaguena salerosa'. People who THINK they are avant garde need to buy this album..."
3,Bathroom iten,"It is a nicely made item for a small bathroom. However, the bowlbrush needs to be upgraded to a more specialized one to clean around the holes."
5,An Antique Print Mystery,I ordered 3 of the 4 books in this series and enjoyed them very much. (I already had the 4th one). I would suggest that anyone wanting to read a good mystery that they should read these. They will keep you guessing and you get to enjoy reading about their lives.
3,shadowy,"The title of this book was well-chosen. Qualifying as a ""cozy"" mystery, Shadows provides a slow-moving tale of ghosts, accidents, and murder with the potential to become more intriguing than it actually is. The residents of this small town in Maine are depicted as dour and unwelcoming, resentful of outlanders and bound by centuries of inbreeding and tradition. The unwitting city folk who have the audacity to buy a 250-year-old, dilapidated house are almost immediately subjected to anonymous intimidation. Nearly everyone, however, comes across as somewhat wooden, hard for the reader to care much about. And mystery becomes solvable only halfway through the book. Shadows on the Coast of Maine is a quick, effortless read that provides entertainment but not much more."
4,More delightful antiques -- and better than the first book,"More delightful reading about antiques from Lea Wait. This locale (the down east Maine coast) is particularly enjoyable and the characters are, in my opinions, much better drawn than in the first mystery (Shadows at the Fair.) There are a few moments of writing that really shine in this book -- something I would not have said about the first -- and Wait shows glimmers of clear, deep thinking and a wonderful ability to articulate -- as in her observations about growing up in the suburbs versus growing up in a little town in Maine. Altogether, a leap forward in quality from the first book, and highly recommended -- if you are interested in old houses, old implements, old prints and the people who transact in them."
3,"No as good as ""Powerful People""... But interesting!","Gino Vannelli was certainly unable to obtain the same level of popularity he got with ""Powerful People"" with this ""The Gist Of The Gemini"".Some obscure songs, overpowered sound of keyboards and synthesizers, made this album a not-so-good sequence to ""Powerful..."" However two tunes deserve to be listened: ""Love Of My Life"" and ""Summers Of My Life""."
1,Waste of money: Very disappointing.,"This album did not live up to ""Powerful People"", ""Storm at Sunup"", or ""A Pauper in Paradise"". Now I remember why I bought all the others in vinyl and abstained from buying this album. I thought it was terrible. ""Love of My Life"" is the only good song in this sad collection. Thank God his later releases made up for this meager effort. If your trying to decide whether or not to buy this album, save your money or try buying any of the above or ""Brother to Brother"" or even ""Nightwalker"" . Sorry Gino, but don't feel too bad; I have been buying your recordings since the mid 70's and have only been disappointed once."
5,Did you get the gist?,"After 25 years of listening to gino's work I still maintain that this is his best. A way-ahead-of-its time infusion of rock,dance,jazz and even classical! Genius stuff,here,folks! True musicians love this work and the variety of moods,vocals and instrumental styles make it at once serious,fun and insightful. Enjoy!"
1,Amateurish,"As a ""southern novel"" this book is more in keeping w/ Gone with the Wind than Sound and the Fury. Its simplistically written in a maudlin style that seems reminiscent of modern chick lit. Flat dialogue and a lack of detail make this book a must skip."
2,"full of functions, but not good","It has all of the function you may expect. But,1. Pictures show incorrect tune, some unpleasing blue and pink.2. Slow writting, sometimes failed writting. If you like to catch some moments, you won't be happy with it.3. Slow start up. To save battery, it automatic shut down after being idle for 1 minute. Once you want to wake it up, you have to wait for 15 seconds. You may miss everything during this time.4. Battery lasts shorter than described in manual.Other than these, it is good."
5,We love it.,"My husband's folks got this for us for Christmas. We used the camera a ton while we were home on leave, taking all kinds of different pictures of everyone. Now we are here in Germany and are able to take pictures all day of everything in sight. Our family loves being able to see such great pictures of the kids and the sights. The only bummer is that when our computer arrived, the installation software was not able to use the computer as a super disk driver (we have Windows XP), so we have as yet to figure out some way to retrieve all the photos we took on the super disk. The floppys are working fine for now though. This is the most fun I have ever had with any camera."
1,did not work when I received the plamcam,I was very disappointed when I received the camera as I the same camera and it had my mom and dad's fifty's wedding anniversary on the disk I wanted to get them download to my computer and when the camera came it did the same thing the camera I have did. SO I was not impressed with the results. Ty
5,Another excellent UFC,"Great event that includes the battle between Randy ""the natural"" Couture and Tito Ortiz, and Tim Sylvia defending his heavyweight belt against Gan Mcgee.Other fights include:Hermes Franca vs. Caol UnoNick Diaz vs. Jeremy JacksonJosh Thomson vs. Gerald StrebendtKaro Parisyan vs. Dave StrasserRich Franklin vs. Edwin DeweesJorge Rivera vs. David LoiseauAndrei Arlovski vs. Vladimir MatyushenkoHighly recommended."
3,doesn't extend far enough into the sink,"We bought this faucet when we were renovating our bathrooms. We love the look of the style and the extra handle was a nice addition. The problem is this, the faucet only extends about 3 inches into the sink. When washing hands, there's not enough space between the side of the sink and the stream of water. Water is splashed all over the counter in back of the faucet and we are perpetually hitting our hands on the bowl of the sink. The faucet itself is solid, no leaking and simple to install. Design - not the best..."
3,"Made in USA- NOT So ""Extra Capacity"" as Claimed","I wanted a C-wrench that was of high quality and NOT made in China. Klein Tools was a natural choice to fill bothcriteria. In fact, this wrench is USA made! HOWEVER, tho this is titled as an ""Extra Capacity"" wrench, the jaws only open as far as my last 8"" C-wrench, BUT THE JAWS ARE NOT AS DEEP, so you don't get a decent *bite* on a nut with it. This doesn't always matter, but i have found it to matter from time to time. I use the wrench for work; it's one of my primary tools, in fact- so i use it a LOT. I have no beef with the quality of the tool- Klein is above most other manufacturers in this regard, but the words ""Extra Capacity"" are somewhat misleading. If you are going to buy an 8"" C-wrench, forget the extra capacity and go for a normal wrench. If you need any ""extra"" capacity, get a 10"" wrench!Unfortunately, dimensions of this sort would never be found in any description."
4,Not quite a Klein,"I am a fan of Klein Tools, and did not give much thought to buying this other than the brand name. Its a fine little wrench, but not really anything special. On par with other decent brands of adjustable wrenches, Crescent, or Channel Lock for example. In fact, I think the Channel Locks are a little better machined. Mine does have a rubber grip on it, which is not shown in all the pictures. I have no complaints, and do like the wrench, but I would also not tell anyone to choose this one over others in its class."
3,"Long, But Detailed","This is a very readable account of the 1992 presidential election. As always, the most interesting elements concern the losing candidates (in this case Perot, Bush, Tsongas). However, this work provides a great portrayal of how President Bill Clinton emerged as the nominee. One forgets that it wasn't a foregone conclusion that he would win and the team's ability to craft a message played a key role in his success. The only problem with the book is how loooonnnnnggg it is. Seriously, 700+ pages is a bit much even for those of us who are interested."
1,Book for liberals,"This book was written for liberals so conservatives don't bother. Biased ""History"". The Wall Street Journal needs to be more careful in their book recommendations."
4,Classic fun,Its really fun and has a great atmosphere. Central hub keeps you focused and the game has a great hook.
5,brenda russell,"I owned this on cassette when it first came out and absolutely loved every song. Through the years I've played it at all gatherings and everyones reaction is the same they love her sound. After years of cassette playing I've decided to order the cd. This music is timeless and the best. Trust me, this one you'll enjoy."
4,Warmth with weight! Luxurious weight.,"This bedspread is beautiful. The reverse side (which I prefer) is all a wonderful golden colored fur (matches my new bamboo floors). It is soft and rich in feel. Everyone that sees this thinks it cost 3 times as much. The construction reminds me of a well made coat. It is incredibly warm but not without weight. This thing is HEAVY, even flipping it is a chore! It has a very 70's retro feel to it but fits right in with my modern decor. I would love to see more colors."
4,Whatever happened to 'Beginner's Mind'?,"dang, this is one book to discourage anyone from ever starting zen if i've ever seen one, Daido Roshi no doubt knows what he's talking about, but when he lays out a whole zen catechism of 100s of koans and various elitist sounding artsy practices required for entry into Buddha's country club, it sounds like a graduate school curriculum or something. I think this book is maybe a reaction to the laxity and scandals of 1st generation American zen. Now the 2nd generation teachers are reverting back to good-old fundamentalism and rigor to keep out the riff-raff. Guess we can see the age-old story of religious evolution happening before our very eyes here. Anyway, I sure missed the anti-elitist open-hearted Spirit of Suzuki Roshi's 'Zen Mind Beginner's Mind' while I was trying to read 'Eight Gates'.fyi, check out some critiques and affirmations of American Zen at:"
4,Good Movie,"i like the plot of this movie and the star actor along with a few of the other actors, all are very interesting, there are however a few boring moments in this film, so i couldnt give it a five."
3,white bread,"The Atlantic Years is pretty bland stuff, not NEARLY as much fun as when she recorded as ""Little Esther"". In fact she sounds a LOT like Dinah Washington on this CD, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, just redundant. Seems like crossover market stuff; didn't turn my props!"
2,Too Flimsy,"I purchased this stand specifically for the top portion - a simple way to put my iPhone onto a tripod. But before I had even tried to mount the clamp onto something more interesting, the piece of plastic developed cracks. Turns out that you screw the plastic clamp part directly to the supplied tripod. Metal vs. Plastic isn't much of a fair fight. It hasn't completely been useless and if your only intention was to use the clamp on the small supplied tripod, that works okay. It does grip the iPhone without scratching it and the clamp has a decent enough hold to do the job. If you can find something else for a few more dollars, go that direction, but if you just need a cheap little stand, that is what this is."
4,great Value,"I bought this for use with my Galaxy S II. The group performs well and is functional. The tripod portion is a bit flimsy however. You can remove the grip, and mount it to a full size tripod though. I was worried that the gripping force would be too , but is adequate. The mount works in portrait and landscape mode. For the price, it deserves 4 stars."
1,pitiful,"These hammers are the worse excuse for deadblow hammers I""ve ever seen.I wrote Cummins and they refuse to return my e-Mail.The product does not qualify for Industrial grade. Would not recommend to any mechanics."
5,Cute and Funny,"We borrowed this from the library. My 3 year old thought this was a good book, and I found it entertaining, too. We bought it as a gift for one of her friends."
1,Caution!,I purchased this tiller based upon the many favorable reviews that have been posted. Maybe I am doing something wrong because my impression is not that great. I have reviewed the CD often as to the proper procedure but i still am not happy with it. I have been tilling in fairly soft ground and two times I have had this tiller skip across the top of soil and up my leg. I view this machine as dangerous. It seems that you have to go backwards with this tiller instead of it moving forward.
5,cgpjr,"This is my second Mantis. The first was used hard and lasted probably 15 years. I broke a tilling blade and they made good on their lifetime guarantee.I use raised beds now, and it is perfect for tilling and cultivating them.You can find small tillers for less, but I believe the difference is worth it."
4,Great machine.,"I am loving the lighter weight and ease of use. Our big tiller is so hard to manuver and makes such a large path, that this makes working between rows so nice and easy. Seems to run great and has been easy to start."
5,Big things come in small packages,"This little guy gets the job done. Understand its doesn't have the weight to till new gardens ""So yes it sucks breaking new ground"". For existing gardens that have been worked season after season this little guy doesn't play. I have a 40x40 vegetable garden that this little guy allows me to till small sections as I switch from season to season. Does exactly what I want it too and more."
4,"Buy it, already!","Great product!!! I had been eyeing it for months and finally, based on reviews, purchased it. Delivery was fast and I was up and running in no time. The Mantis is lightweight and easy to maneuver. No holding on for dear life as the machine bumps all over the place. This was easy! I literally tilled my backyard garden in 45 minutes, and I live in South Carolina, known for the red clay. Now, would I use it on a parcel of land compacted for years and hard as a rock, probably not. But for areas tilled in the past, such as a yearly garden, it rules!"
1,not work well for me!,"I saw all the great reviews. Sadly it rarely starts for me. I took it to 2 shops and yes it ran after costly repairs each time. Now I want to sell it and it won't start. yes, I can read and I do it by the book.I will get the Troy electric.Wanna buy it cheap?Kayak4evr@aol.com"
5,Older Mantis tiller still works great!,"I bought my Mantis fourteen years ago for turning raised beds. During that time I've used it for that purpose plus one summer I dug holes for shrub planting in clay soil with my wife pushing down on top of the motor while I ran the controls! Insanity - but it didn't break. This summer I used it to break up old soil and mix in compost for rejuvenating old beds at a new house. I'm embarrassed to say that I've never had the machine tuned up. I drain the old gas for winter and only use good quality oil in the gas mix, and I clean the air filter. I've managed to break a couple of tines on rocks but otherwise it runs like new. It ALWAYS starts on two or three pulls when I bring it out of storage each year. It's light and hops around when it hits rocks but just chews the daylights out of anything in its path. If it was stolen or run over by a truck I'd buy a new one in a minute - one of the very best tool purchases I ever made!"
5,A great product,"After taking on a allotment, it was becoming very difficult to find the time to prepare the soil for planting our vegetables. We bought this in the US, and brought it back to england. It has proved invaluable to us, enabling us to cultivate our plot so quickly. It is tough to use, wear gloves or you will get blisters, but the results are amazing. It was also sent to us with free postage, so was great value aswell. I would say this is essential for those who just dont have the time to dig their plots."
1,Mantis Tiller only last until the warrenty runs out.,"I bought a Mantis Tiller about two years ago. It lasted until the warrenty ran out. I sent it back to Mantis, and was told it would cost around $200.00 to repair. I told them to send it back to me. I junked it and bought a HONDA. No comparison. The Honda is much better. I will NEVER buy another anything that has the Mantis name on it."
2,"If you can get it to start, it is pretty good.","It works pretty good, but it is hard to start it. The system is too complicated, and I am a 40 yo male who works out 4-5 times a week. But I have difficulty getting it started. Most time, it causes a blister pulling the chain before it would start. That is the main concern."
1,JUNK!,Save your money!!! I bought this POS brand new and could only get it to start after 2.5 hours of fiddling with it. It ran for 10 minutes and that was it. I returned this worthless piece of junk and bought a Honda FG110. Much better machine. Mantis should be ashamed of themselves for even selling this piece of garbage. My uncle had a Mantis that has run like a champ for 15 years so I guess their quality just isn't the same. Sad.
3,Good for exisiting gardens and flower beds but not so good for starting one,"I'm pleased with the performance of the Mantis 7225, however it doesn't have the power to start a garden from scratch -- for example, if you had a patch of lawn you wanted to turn into a garden. The blades get clogged with grass very fast and you have to remove them and clean them off. You can do it, it just takes a very long time. It also doesn't do well in wet or damp soil.However, it is excellent for existing gardens, to either weed in-between rows or re-till for replanting. I use it to mix in fresh garden soil and to get rid of weeds mainly.Not a ton of power but it is light-weight (20 pounds) and easy to use, though you have to walk backward to use it best. Also, because it is a two-stroke engine, you need to mix the gas with 2-stroke oil which can be a pain.But overall, for the price, this is a good garden tool for small backyard gardens and flowerbeds."
2,MANTIS TILLER,the tiller was a great price and it was not hard to put together the only problem with it is that it would not start right out of the box so now it has to get repaired. i bought this because they have been arount for a long time so i spent the extra money for it but now would it have been beter to go to lowes and buy a less expensive model.
3,Not Your Daddy's Tiller,"I bought this for my wife to use between the rows in the vegetable garden. At the beginning of the season, I always till about 7"" to 8"" deep with a PTO-driven 6' tiller behind a MF tractor. Without that, this tiller would be worthless in the Virginia soil. I've tried it a few times and, although it's light, it jumps around so much that it's just as tiring as using an 8 to 10 hp self-propelled walk-behind tiller. Even my wife is not too happy to use it... I also purchased the Mantis 1722-00-02 Tiller Weed Reducers, which make cleaning the weeds away from the tines a simple task."
1,Things Change for the Worst,"First, let me say I bought one of the original Mantis tillers about 8 years ago---it was fantastic, but finally died. So I went right back to Mantis---I'm so sorry I did.Assembly and start-up was fairly clear and easy.I ran it for less than an hour. The next day, it would start and die within 5 seconds. Contacted the mfg. and followed all directions including buying fresh gas, though what I had was only 30 days old. Still won't stay running.My old Mantis was used once a year and started with less than 6 pulls EVERY TIME. Guess things change."
5,"Easy, versatile, great overall yard tool!","I've compared a handful of similar products at the local Home Depot and Lowes and nothing comes close to the effectiveness of the Mantis for the price! Used it for tilling large patches of hard and rock covered terrain, dug holes for planting and softening top soil for cultivating. Works wonderful - highly recommended"
3,Older Mantis,"My mantis is older but looks like a new one. Runs ok . Don't leave fuel over the winter in it. If you need parts,they can be hard to get like a fuel cap.carb. parts."
2,not very durable,I bought this ring a month ago and wear it every day. It seems to have quite a few scratches for being very new. Since I have an office job I don't do anything that would cause it to have so many scratches already. I assumed that titanium was more durable than gold or silver but I quess not.
3,"Oversized book covers embroidery, crochet & knitting","I agree with the other reviewer's remarks and since there is no Look Inside feature, I uploaded some Images above because I thought it would be helpful to see some of what's inside. This is a very large, over-sized book and with being published in 1969, on the cusp of the needlework upsurge, it's a remarkably modern book. I too am not interested in crochet or knitting but the how-to photos make them look doable. I gave this only 3 stars simply because I have many other books I prefer to this. But all in all, not a bad book."
1,This Picture Is Unwatchable--Do Not Go Near It,"Tom Keene had a good voice to go with his good looks. Unfortunately, he didn't learn how to put his considerable presence and charm to use until after his starring career had concluded. Whatever you do, don't order this thing. It isn't long, but the time passes slowly. Take my advice, and JUST pass."
5,Absolutely FAB!,"I was a fan of the first 2 seasons and bought the DVDs a couple years ago but had NO IDEA season 3 was even out! I can honestly say that this is my favorite season so far. Season 3 has many of the same characters but they have also added some new ones to keep it interesting. But my favorites are the old ones though (pimp and hos and the shopping ladies). They always make me laugh. Plus, this season's guests includes the B52's! I think maybe their budget went up."
1,"This book is a contradiction in terms, it is anti-Macedonian","While the title would suggest that the book is a review ofMacedonia and the Macedonian people and their role in Balkan politics,it is really an anti-Macedonian diatribe, with articles by anti-Macedonian authors like Evangelos Kofos included. Mr. Shea's book,Macedonia and Greece is an unbiased version of Macedonian history,a much better read than Mr.Pettifer's anti-Macedonian propaganda machine."
1,The same one-sided pro-Greek garbage as always,"Investigative journalism instead of rehashed pro-Greek and anti-Macedonian propaganda would have been nice, but that is of course too much to expect from an author who enjoys patronage of Athens.Where are the accounts from ethnic Macedonians? Referring to Kosovo as Kosova also shows the author's stance on that issue.Utter garbage, which fails to pay due attention to the Macedonians and their cultural heritage. There are much better books on Macedonia that discuss the Macedonian Question from a far more neutral standpoint than this one. John Shea's: Macedonia and Greece comes to mind."
1,James Pettifer; Publicist or Writer?,"Most writers when they write, whether it is fiction or non-fiction, tend to do some sort of research. I find that Mr. Pettifers writng is based not on unbiased research, but based onhis ""patrons"" distorted view on history. Mr. Pettifer has taken a one-sided approach to the Kosovo conflict. By referring to the region as ""Kosova"", he legitimizes the aspirarations of separtists terrorists in that region.From his previous writings to this latest ""reportage"" I would guess that Mr. Pettifer could not make it as an investigative reporter, but instead choose to write for a public relations firm that has terrorists for clients.I would recommend Salonicus Terminus, by Fred A Reed, for unbiased reporting on the Balkans as well as (the Republic of) Macedonia!"
4,Cheap and effective,"I have an 80's Schwinn x-lite Voyager SP. These shifter cables were an easy fitment to my Shimano gear. Plenty long enough, and the fit was super.These cables do not come with outer shielding, these are just the cables. They would be 5 star if they shipped with cable end protectors.I would highly recommend these to anyone in need of new cables."
2,An Average Album,"Fabs new album Real Talk was just another album from another popular mc. I never really picked up on a real message or on his lyrics, there are a couple hot tracks like Breath and Don't Stop Won't Stop but its mainly just the beats that make Fab famous. I don't reccommend anyone buying this CD."
2,Real Talk by Fabolous,"Fabolous has serious skills, and his cameos on other artists albums are normally stellar, but when it comes time for him to record a full length album he just doesn't keep my attention. While the beats supplied by Scott Storch, The Neptunes and others are fire, its the delivery over them that I can't get into. Maybe its the fact that his flow is so lazy & laid back and at times I'm lookin for something more and no matter what the beat is, the flow is the same. ""Breathe"" is a fantastic single; possibly his best work to date, and Lil Mo sounds unreal on ""Holla at Somebody Real"" my early favorite for a second single. Real Talk, much like his previous albums, is very all over the place- directed to the streets, the ladies, the mainstream radio market and it just seems like to much of a mess. Great rapper, poor album."
1,Disappointment,"Man, I really feel like I'm getting old. Every song I heard either had the b-word or the n-word and it was annoying. What happened to hip-hop music? Why is rap taking over hip-hop? And why is it so cliche'? Even when the cursing and the race degrading wasn't going on, the remaining songs were corny or cliche with dude requesting a girl who had a flat gut, big butt, blonde streaks, etc. etc. I had never listened to Fabolous before really because nothing about his style really caught me, but I was impressed with the song ""Baby"". I really enjoyed #18 on his cd about the police but other than that, this whole album was cliche."
5,a lot more than i expected,"This album to me is very well done. not really being a Fab fan i wasnt really knowing wat to expect the lead single ""Breathe"" sold me tho so wen i coped the cd i was ready for sumthin. many of the songs are very catchy the hooks relly just wanna make u say hell yea....Fab has very nice aggressive flows over very good beats...i definately recommend this cd its very good."
4,Nice but Uhhhhh,"When people argue over who the best rapper is, for some odd reason Fabolous never comes up. There's no doubt that he is one the sickest dudes on the mic but he never is mentioned as the one the greats. Anyway Real Talk is a nice album, and just simply that, it isn't fantastic or anything that really blows you away. Fab's flow is sick but his delivery doesn't make it seem that way. The production is solid, Fab's flow is tight but what makes this album 4 stars and not 5 is because it lacks originality. This is why Fab probably is never considered one of the best rappers around, without a doubt lyrically he can compete with anyone (probably is the best around) anyway he doesn't have that distinctness that a Jay-Z, Naz, or Eminem, had. Many people consider 2pac one of the greatest ever, he was o.k. on the mic, but it was his charisma that made him so great, that charisma is exactly why fabolous is not great."
3,This is wonderful prose!,"I'm very high class by nature. I drink only Boone's farm, eat the finest wings and have a fade that you wish you had. I really liked listening to this album. It made me happy. My feet started tapping to the beat and next thing you know I'm busting a move! I think what Fab-O-LOus is trying to say with this whole thing is that we need to start getting real with one another. We have a lot of problems like drugs and violence, but if we keep it real no one should get hurt. I remember sitting down with Kool G. Froot Loop and he said that the farmosuetocal companies are bringing down the house and Dr. King wouldn't. That's where this is."
4,Good effort - Gangster,This album is alright... Not a great fan of Fabulous but it seems that he made an effort with this album so i bought it...Good tracks include...Dont stop...GangstaBabyGirlsCan you hear me - HOTBreatheYoung and Sexy - HOT (gotta ride to this)The other tracks are alright - Enough 'fly' tracks to call it a good album.Im out...Peace
2,At least it's better than Street Dreams,"Yo first of all let me say that I've been a Fab fan before a lot of you had even heard of the kid. However, fact remains that this album is trash. I have to be hard on this cat because I know his potential, and the kid is nice. His lyrics are almost elementary in this album, while the production isn't even that inspiring ( with the exception of JB's Breathe ). What happened to the hungry kid from BK that was keepin' it gangsta on "" Ghetto Fabolous "" ? Beats me, but thats the Fabolous I want to hear from. So here we are with the second consecutive Fabolous album with 1 decent track. ( sigh ) Fab isn't displaying his talent. It seems that in his attempt to please multiple genres, he also dilutes what made him cooked crack on "" Ghetto Fabolous "". Hopefully he'll find his way, but until then check him out on the mixtape scene ( DJ Envy, Big Mike, DJ Clue, and DJ Kay Slay )"
4,"Real Talk, Real Better then Street Dreams","I have Always been a FaBo fan, Ever since the gangsta track with Nate Do-Double, his rhyme schemes and metaphors where the best coming from any new cat. His first album was a classic, but his second album just didn't grap me, and he fell into the sophmore jinx, or was just following the pattern of the best brooklyn rapper Jay-Z. First album is a classic, second album, too much trying to be mainstream. Third Album, blend the two together and make magic. Real Talk comes straight from the streets for fabolous with the great hip-hop track Breathe, produced by Just Blaze. He of course has some ladies and party tracks, but the best part is how he blends them together to give every track the same vibe. Its Real Talk, so listen up to a dope MC."
2,I don't know Fabby,"Look I decided to get this cd because i fell in love with breathe from the first time i heard it, and i didn't own any of his previous records but i love his slick metaphors and word play so i figured i'd cop this one but on the first listen it is pretty dissapointing and i haven't gone back too much to listen to it again because no song really stood out in my head besides breathe. i got into ""baby"" after seeing the video, but the reason why i'm not dissing it altogether is because i may start to like it later on down the line but the prospects aren't looking too good. sorry fab."
5,Solid.,"Real Talk is the perfect mixture of hip hop and r&b. Fabolous brings the best of him for this one, just as he has done before with the two previous albums. Fab shows that he can put some content in his songs with ""Breathe' and ""PoPo,"" and shows a softer side dedicated to the ladies with ""Baby"" and ""Holla At Somebody Real."" Easy 5 in my view."
5,A Solid Album!,"I think this cd deserves higher ratings than its gettin' now. Fabolous is not like some other mainstream rappers (50 Cent). He got the talent and unlike other rappers he is not getting played out even after his singles been playin' all over the radio.""Real Talk"" is definitely a step up from ""Street Dreams"". ""Street dreams"" is a party album with great beats and some nice lyrics! ""Real Talk"" is a party/street/gangsta rap album with equally great beats. Lyrics, howerver, are improved in this album. ""Intro"" is performed by Black Ice. Just a accapella. ""Won't Stop, Don't Stop"" is a nice song with laid back beat. His flow is changed in the song. ""Baby"" is probably the best song with intellegent lyrics! The video is pretty good too! Some Other good songs are: ""GANGSTA"", ""Ghetto"", ""Po Po's"" and ""Can You Hear Me"".The Track listing on Amazon is wrong. The songs are not in order and some are not even in the album.Pick this album if you liked his other albums."
4,Great Album...mayb his best,"This is a great album.....it is truly amazing. Every album he releases seems 2 b better and better than the original...and in my opinion I think that this is his best album so far...... His lyrical skills really stands out on this album....especially on tracks like ""Gangsta"", ""Don't Stop Won't Stop"" and he changes it up a lil' bit on the track with Sean Paul ""It's Alright"" Overall...this album is really really good and any rap fan should cop this album."
5,True Album,Ok ARTIST TAKE NOTES THIS IS WAT A CD IS SUPPOSE TA BE SKIP TRACKS ONLY CUZ U TIRED OF HEARIN THEM LIL MO IS ON THERE OF COURSE BUT THIS IS PROBLY THE HOTEST ALBUM OF 2004 GOT IT FAB CAN U TOP THIS
1,No,"Fab can definetely rhyme, but his songs on this album are the same thing with the exeption of Breath. More songs about women and i am tired of hearing about it. I give him credit for rhyming though so i gave him 1 star."
2,Real Talk NOPE,Fab ain't the king of New York like everybody talkin. He spit on some of his songs but he got too many singin songs to be labeled hard. Go check out some Luda or the Ying Yang twins then holla back at me.
1,WACK.,"This Man is wack, He is making hip hop look like a joke. Do not bye this album. Please do not bye this album."
1,Naw diz wack... Fagolouz is garbage...,"I never realy found diz guy a bit impressive at all and he made it worse by always spelling his name on ever f*cking song too. Realy, ain nuthing special bout fagolous and his lirycs and flow will make you fallasleep real quick...Trust me man, its boring. The whole album is boring and the beats were even pretty terrible so don't buy fabolous's ""Real Talk"" insted save the new nas album ""street's disciple"" which will be a betta wiser choise, ight? Fagolous is pure boring trash and i bet going to church or school can actullie be more fun then listining to diz fagot."
1,Hez wack,fabolous aint tight at all lets just put it at that. He cant rap all that good. he alawys raps about the same stuff and his lyrics are nuffin to get excited about. this cd should been called [...] talk cuz this [...] is wack hez just another rip off of other rappers before em.
4,real talk,"Real TALK IS A NICE CD I LIKE IT SONG I LIKE2.3.10.11.13.OF COURSE 14 NEXT SINGLE,15 HOT BEAT,AND 18 LOVE ITOKAY 4,5,9 AND 12WEAK GIRLS AND BABYGOOD CD CHECK IT OUT"
5,Fab new album is f a b o l o u s,"Its not meant to be hard court street slanging rap. Its cool lay back relaxed, and listen to the whole album straight. You can not get tired of this alvum and it is of him stepping out of the shell and appealing to a wider audience."
4,"FAB-olous......better flows, best album of his carrer....","the thing with fabolous that i like is that he gets better production on each album. his beats get better and better on each album... REAL TALK is no different, this album is hot to def... but i was not a fabolous fan for a long time becasuse his rhymes seem grade school.... at least his flows are growing with times...this album is off the chain.... both joints with mr. neptunes himself pharrell are hot. the clip with sean paul is mr. paul's best cameo since his joint with blu cantrell on 'breathe remix'...but nothing touches his hit single 'breathe' that beat is off this planet... he is talkin to all the hater out there...if more rappers do their thang and change their flows more than hip hop would get more props... i hope fabolous will be the first to start a trend...4 out of 5 stars"
4,"Neat idea, but...","When I saw this desk, I just knew my son would love it. It is a great idea, but I think it was not well made. Although the price is good, I just expected the quality to be a little better. My son didn't seem to mind, though."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Several of the ""Star Trek"" actors have written autobiographies, and I've read most of them. I found ""Beam Me Up, Scotty"" to be somewhat disappointing. The book is quite short, and doesn't have as much Star Trek info as I would have liked. A little more humor would have helped too. William Shatner's books on Star Trek, although some have questioned their accuracy, are certainly much more entertaining to read."
1,can't trust this guy,"You can't believe everything you read, and certainly not anything in this book. According to Jimmy, every director he's ever worked for thinks he's the greatest actor in history (question: if this is true why is he constantly unemployed and living off his (ex-)wives?) According to Jimmy, he is a devout Catholic (if this is true, how can he be thrice-divorced?) More oddities -- according to Jimmy, every woman (especially any woman who had ANYthing to do with Trek) he has ever met has fallen madly in love with him and begged him to sleep with her. (Yes, he's taken most of them up on it.) According to Jimmy, he single-handedly saved the Allies from the Nazis. Yeah, right. To those of you who LIKED this book, where were your brains when you read it? This book is only good as an exercise in shameless self-promotion."
4,It's still good,"I read this book about 2 or 3 weeks ago. I thought it was pretty entertaining. No, he doesn't really talk much about ST. This isn't really a Scotty book. I mean, if he was talking about Scotty he would've started talking about ST on page 1. No, not a Scotty book. This is the life and times of James Doohan. It makes an interesting read, especially if you want to read about James.I must say that I'm proud of James leaving it simple that he didn't like Shatner. I'm sure we would've had 1 star reviews still if he dissed Shatner all through out the book. After reading the other ST autobiographies, I feel each one had the chance to do some major dissing. The didn't take that route. They have sense enough to realize that ST fans are interested in the show and not with the backstage battles of Shatner vs. Everybody."
5,A great book.,"A library copy, but I bought to read, not collect. Hard to find so I was glad to find it for such a good price."
3,Nothing new here...,"I gotta agree with the other reviewers here--all of the tracks are previously released material, over-polished by RCA and containing none of the live-concert feel of the FTD CDs. Tacking on the studio recording of ""Viva Las Vegas"" at the start and giving it that title is just a cheap marketing ploy. But, hey, if it reminds people of the greatness of Elvis Presley and dispels some of the unfair myths of him as just an overweight has-been in later years--fine with me.In other words, if you know Elvis, skip this. If you're a casual fan or a newcomer, you'll be amazed at the power of his live performances. RCA never got it right, and they prove it again with this release. Like others, I just can't believe this is the best they could come up with on the big anniversary."
3,I assumed wrong,"I expected the cars to be metal, but they were really lightweight plastic. I do have to say that it is a very affordable way of getting all the characters from the Cars movie."
3,Cars,My sons enjoy their collection die-cast set of cars. I bought this set for my nephew not realizing that there was a difference in quality. These are plastic and light weight and break easily. Pay more and get the die-cast cars it is worth it. I
4,My grandson loves Cars things!!,I bought these for my 2 1/2 year old grandson who is a great Cars fan. He loves playing with them in the van while we are traveling. They also work on his car track that he has for another toy. They are great.
3,Let me explain something...,"The writing of these short stories is easily 5 stars. Valerie Martin is truly a gifted writer and I was really sucked into these stories through the beautiful language. I took off 2 stars for 2 big reasons (in my opinion):1) Beautiful language elevates the mind and soul and I believe that few writers today can reach that. While Valerie Martin, in my opinion, writes exquisite prose, she also uses the F word repeatedly, which she should not do. If someone is truly gifted with language, they don't need to resort to base and foul language for effect.2) The stories become formulaic after a while. The formula is ""artist has an artistic talent but struggles with getting recognized or satisfaction from their art"" etc, etc. In a way, it's hard for me to distinguish the stories.Conclusion for me? Valerie Martin is a fantastic writer who is very much like her characters: flawed, and hoping for a big break. I don't think this book is it."
3,A Somewhat Uneven Anthology,"Valerie Martin's compendium of tales about artists and relationships is, unfortunately, rather uneven. Some of the tales are gripping and leave you wanting more, while others seem to slog along (particularly the title piece for the anthology). The good thing about this book is that it examines all manner of human relationships across sexual orientations, ethnicities and ages. I just wish the work had been more consistently good, because the well-written tales were delightful although they pointed up the flaws of the lesser works."
4,Solid collection of talent,"This is a nice collection from a very good author that takes several stories to examine relationships and the realities of people who dwell on the very artistic end of the social spectrum.* All stories are well-written, but some are much better than others -- the collection is a tad uneven* This is not a collection for someone looking for uplifting story matter* This would be a good reference book on how a writer explores several different story types in the same emotional setting* If you read them all at once, the book may feel formulaic -- I do recommend taking it in a story at a time* The use of language is very advanced yet does not feel forced, it is lovely* I would not give this book to an artist just starting out, it is bleakI really enjoyed this book; it is like hearing your favorite sad song on the radio."
2,missable,"The writer came up with good plots, but unfortunately, the rest of her writing is lacking. The writing style is reminds me of the guy on Dragnet -- flat and dry -- ""Just the facts."" The writer advances too quickly, covering too much in each paragraph. The details (sight, sound, smell, and often feelings) are largely left out. I could not get into the characters because I just didn't have the feel of being there, like a do with a good book. What ""feeling"" there was to the book was a gritty, world-weary feeling that I didn't care to experience. Maybe goths would enjoy it, others can probably skip it and miss nothing."
3,"Short stories, one has to be in the mood to read","These are mostly slow moving stories that are a good read while drinking a glass of wine. The good thing is, you can drink a glass and be done. They take you to the different aspects of art, and the artists who create, and delve somewhat perceptively into the makeup, motivations and vulnerabilities of those artists. There are some fascinating observations, and one only has to read the title story to get a good sense of where they author's mind is at. My favorite was ""The Change""."
3,Fun quick and bizarre short stories with well-written prose,"Valerie Martin's writing is very likable. This book contains 5 short stories, and constitutes first of short stories I have read in a very long time. My favorite by far was ""The Bower"" - the story of Carter and Sandra. I found the ""Unfinished Novel"" disturbing but captivating. The last story, ""The Change"" was bizarre and pointless in my opinion. All the stories revolve around artists, writers, dancers, actors - a chapter or two of their lives taken out and committed to the pages of Martin's book. I enjoyed her prose and read the book in one day. I think many people would enjoy it."
1,AMONG THE DARK STRANDS OF MY DISMAY AT HAVING BEEN SO SMOOTHLY APPREHENDED BY RITA WAS A GLITTERING THREAD OF VINDICATED SPITE,"These short stories run from melodramatically over-written to bare-boned, flat-as-a-tech manual exposition. It seems that there is a careless attitude running through, words and word pairings were tried, trite and so-what true. A veil runs through every story flattening out the characters and creating a hum-drum meter. The results: Boring, pointless, time-wasting.That the author created not one character of interest - no passions or surprises or insights - makes me think I've been reading too many good writers lately. My expectations have grown higher. If this was a first effort I'd be more lenient. But it's not."
1,Low Point of Career,"This was the worst thing Gato Barbieri ever recorded. It's nothing but crass commercialism. It's almost a disco album with Gato's sax on top. This is NOT what Gato was about. It's almost laughable, and it's little wonder that Gato disappeared for a while after making this album. Avoid getting this. Hopefully, this album will never appear on a CD. If you want to hear Gato at his finest, go with the ""Chapters"" series or the first two albums he did on A&M."
3,"An ""Amaryllis"" Not Quite Fully in Bloom","I am a huge fan of The Place in Flowers Where Pollen Rests, Paul West's staggeringly inventive novel of the southwest; but I have to say I was disappointed by this book overall. The idea sounds SO fruitful: imagine John Milton, the man who wrote one of the great religious epics of all time, Paradise Lost, as a lascivious undergrad desperate to lose his virginity. But the premise is more enticing in summary than in execution, and I was even more dismayed to find West treating Amaryllis as a LITERAL muse. West's writing is always a pleasure, but this book, sorry to say, leaves one mostly with the impression of a great opportunity lost."
3,Stylish and it works too.,"I find the Motorola H500 is best suited for quiet places. I always wondered why people went around screaming into their headsets. Now I know, in a crowded or noisy place the headset seems to pick up all sounds making it difficult to continue a conversation. But for home or the car it's great.One tip from me: Don't buy it from Ace Digital, they sent me a used one. The one I bought directly from Amazon is great."
3,makes a noise on the recieving end,"I bought and loved it at first. There arent any problems on my end, but everyone I talk to on the other end complains of a buzzing when I call and talk to them. I rarely use it now because of the problem."
1,Didn't work for me,"The ear piece is not universal - it didn't fit me at all. Just fell off. Other than that, it seemed like a quality product. I gave it away."
3,"Curious George was great, but...","we only wish there was more Curious George on this disc. My daughters are not interested at all with the two extra shorts on this collection. I myself do not care for them.So, my 3 star rating is just for the George part of the disc, which in OUR opinion, was fantastic!! It follows the book exactly which made my older daughter so happy since the hospital story is one of her favorites. This is not a cartoon, but an early 1980s film with ""Rudolph the Reindeer motion"" - and it is simply adorable. We watched it over and over again hope to find more Curious George stories by the same production group.Highly recommend it, again, ONLY FOR THE CURIOUS GEORGE SEGMENT!"
3,Not a real cartoon,"I had brought this for my 21 month nephew cause he would see the monkey on other things, but this is a clay people, and not a real cartoon, so he really doesn't watch it."
2,Creepy stories for kids,"While the Curious George portion of this video is ok (my daughter loves it). The other stories are downright morbid and creepy. They gave me nightmares, let alone my kid. I don't understand why such weirdness was lumped together with something as wholesome as Curious George."
1,Front cover is deceiving!,This is NOT a cartoon and my kids did not enjoy it. The look on the cover is that of a cartoon and until you take of the wrapping(thereby voiding your opprtunity to return it) and play it you wouldn't know that.
1,Don't buy this movie!,"Poor George cries about 4 times during this hospital episode, and my 2 year old could not help but cry right along with his favorite character - too sad to rewatch. The next 2 episodes were not sad, but really scary - Mouse Soup is about a little mouse who is running for his life, and Boris Gets a Cold is about germs that attack the poor moose (and features a really scary germ sequence). Maybe better for older kids? - Why bother - there are so many better movies out there to choose from!"
5,excellent music,"Shawn Phillips has a great voice and has no need for any electrictronic enhancementat all. His lyrics are also very good with lots of feeling and meaning. I could listen tothis recording many times without boredom and I even bought Second Contributionfor my sister as a present, and she is very particular about the music she listens to. Ithank the heavens for such wonderful music and amazon.com for their great service."
1,Whenever I watch Animal House...,"and Belushi smashes Steven Bishop's guitar because he was singing that awful tune to the girls, I think of Shawn Phillips."
4,Shawn's music transcends the decades.,"Shawn Phillips' music is an emotional journey that invites you to turn down the lights, crank up the stereo, grab a glass of wine and enjoy the experience. I've always been surprised that he never gained a greater popularity. A&R folk should have done this artist more justice."
5,The sixties music evolved into the seventies,This music listened to alone in the dark will transform you.
5,Creative Music,One disc for eternity. Mystic weaves itself to a whole new mindset.One could easily listen to Shawn everyday. I would like tothank Mr. Phillips and wish him only the best.
2,parts of some songs missing.,"songs were original from Phillips which was good, however several songs were cut short when another song started. at least 25% of several songs were cut when a new song started. this was very annoying. i would not buy from this company again."
5,If you only own one...,"This is the definitive work for Shawn Phillips. It doesn't contain all of the songs you'll remember (such as ""We"" and ""Hey Miss Lonely""), but its cohesiveness and artistry is unique even coming from a time of great acoustic singer/songwriters. I was a huge fan in the '70s and listen to this ""album"" often now that I've rediscovered it. If you only buy one Shawn Phillips album, this should be it."
4,Worldwide Loot,"Was a big fan of this book when I was a kid. Found it fascinating, pretty funnny too. Plenty of drawings. Features Dik Browne's Hagar the Horrible going around Europe, Britain and Russia. Features Dik Browne's view on Viking exploration & Viking life too. Gives some background to the comic strips that way. Worth getting for fans."
3,Collectors only ...,"I find this one a little too pricey - it contains exactly the same songs as standard European version, just other cat. numer & publisher. 5$ or less would be cool - but over 10$ is just for die-hard collectors ..."
1,awful,"This book is silly and puerile beyond belief. The characters are uniformly unlikeable, the plot strained, and there are flaws galore! Ugh! The sample was intriguing so I bought the book. A huge mistake and waste of money."
1,Just Could Not Get Into It...,"I've never read Alex Kava and I guess that I still haven't seeing as I only read about 50 pages. The story line didn't grab me, characters weak, some inconsistencies. Perhaps if I had read other Maggie O'Dell books this one would have worked for me..."
5,The Best,This is another GOOD Maggie O'Dell book I can't get enough of her. Start reading from her first book with Maggie and you will not be able to put her down.
5,Long awaited for questions answered!,"I enjoyed this one quite a bit! Very thrilling, despite the rather predictable nature of the plot. Ultimately, it was fun and a very satisfying read. I especially liked that so many of the threads from the very first book (_A Perfect Evil_) were FINALLY addressed! And after finishing this, I am even more curious about the future direction of the series. It is just such fun to discover and really love a brand new series!"
4,A little disappointed!,"Alex kava is an excellent author, and i absolutely love her character, maggie o'dell. I have read all her previous books, but i found this one a little weak. If you havent read her books before, you should before reading this one, because she doesnt go into the background of her characters very much. I guessed on of the culprits at the beginning of the book, though there was a nice twist i thought at the end, which prompted me to give this book 4 stars instead of 3.5. But i also felt like the end didnt complete maggie's personal life. It didnt say what was going to happen with her and nick, and i was disappointed that she didnt try to form a relationship with her brother. But still this book was good because maggie is an excellent character, but you must read her previous books first! Even though i was a little disappointed by this book i will still definitely read any new books by alex kava."
5,mini-grinder,"The grinder arrived in a short time,in excellent shape. After opening the package I discovered that the grinder had several features normally found in more expensive tools. Well worth the money!"
3,Not bad for the price,Speed settings are not consistant. The lowest setting slowly speeds up to much faster than 5000 rpm. Other than that it's not bad.
5,Great Camera Bag!,Great bag at a great price. Does everything I was looking for in a nice quality size. The canvas is high quality. The color is a very pleasant shade of hunter green. The seller was excellent and shipped quickly and informed me each step of the way.
3,Quality Issues,"I purchased this soldering gun to install connectors on larger coaxial cables. First thing I noticed was that the light does not work. Second, the internal transformer seems to be loose because I can feel it flopping around if I shake the gun. It DOES solder adequately though."
3,"Good Gun, Quality Issues","I have had Weller soldering guns for many decades. I ordered this one and found that the lights did not work unless I pushed them in (shorting to the core). Return was great, but the replacement had the same issue. I disassembled the gun - 3 screws, and was dismayed at the poor quality workmanship. There was a piece of wire about 3"" long floating around and many clippings. I cleaned it up and checked the light voltage (4 Vac) across both lights, but no light. The light bracket was so cheap. The solder joints were terrible.I returned for a refund - this process works very well.I am afraid that offshore manufacturing is somewhat variable and unless we push, it may not improve.roger (Systems Engineer)"
1,Defective Weller D650 (Second one),"I received the replacement for the first one I ordered. On this one, the lights do not work. I am returning it for try #3."
2,"Love my 140watt Weller soldering gun, this one only 150watt","Got this as a higher power compliment to my 100/140 watt Weller soldering gun. Keep in mind that this is the gun only, in a cardboard box, no case or accessories, which was fine with me. It is new. Didn't seem much more powerful in use. Checked it with a watt meter and it only drew 125/150 watts. Yes, I know the first click is high, and fully pulling the trigger is low. Cleaned and tightened the tip, no improvement. On the good side, the return process was great. This was my first Amazon return. Print the label, box it up (in the box it came in), take it to the UPS store, they put the label in a clear plastic shipping label thing, slap it on the box, done. Practically easier than taking it back to Home Depot."
5,Good Product,"I have owned several soldering guns and this is by far the most useful, no problem soldering 10 ga wire."
2,weller industrial soldering gun,"only got hot for a few min. and still gets hot , but not that hot. its ok but I think something is wrong with it,,by the way I Love Amazon. its not there fault"
4,GOOD COLOR,NICE SOCKS BUT NOT QUITE WHAT HUSBAND HAD IN MIND SO WILL HAVE TO RETURN OR EXCHANGE AFTER CHRISTMAS TIME
1,Slipping Socks,"I puchased these socks for my husband. While they were not tight and constrictive, they slipped down, bunching up in his shoes, causing him to remove his shoes several times a day to pull up the socks. Instead of complaining, he finally gave them to our dog who loves to chew on them."
5,diabetic socks review,"Socks very comfortable for someone who spends 8-12 hours standing per day. The socks are about 4 inches longer than my usual crew length socks, and come up mid calf. I wear them slightly lowered and they are very comfortable and stay up well, probably because they are not as loose at the top as other diabetic socks I've owned. I would recommend them and they are more stylish than other diabetic socks, which appear more like athletic socks."
3,Wigwam diabetic walker socks,This product is good but the upper end still not as comfortable as it should be for large calves. The sock is great but the top binds.
4,Good game but sometimes freezes,"The story in this game is really good. Even though it's an old game the graphics are good. But it freezes when loading second level--game still saves itself, but you have to turn the console off and then back on again to reload second level. Overall it is a very good game that I would recommend to anyone."
5,"Cute, Funny and Violent!","This game is very challenging, but somehow very fun. A violent kiddie game. It's pretty funny, too"
5,Sleeper hit of last year,I can't believe this game got slept on. It's great! I also can't understand the two bad reviews. It's a very fun and funny game too. It's little bit like Conker but without all the toilet humor.
2,Fun for a cheap price,"I enjoyed the game despite it's cheesieness. The storyline was funny. However the controls were a bit jumpy, I wished they had smoothed it out. Also you are able to do stealth kills in the game but it is impossible to pull it off. Somehow the enemies find you quicker they they should and once they know you are around they always somehow know where you are. I really enjoyed the extras of this game. You can play a golf mode and a mini golf mode where you go around and shoot the ball and try and make it in. If you have two copies of the game you can system link and play soccer against each other. Overall I found the game fun when playing it in easy mode. I found it frustrating when playing it on hard."
5,I love this book and Jesse Duplantis,"I choose this rating because it he tells the story in such simple form that any one will definitely understand and take so much away from it with them. It is funny but serious at the same time. I am looking at things differently in a brand new way.I would recommend this book to anyone, babes in Christ and adult Christians as well. Happy reading.Agatha"
2,Advertized as new but....,"I ordered this book from a seller fully expecting it to be a brand new book as advertised. What I got was a book that had taken more than a few trips around in someone's book bag. While the book is autographed, it is made out to someone named Connie. Gifting this book is not an option unless I know someone named Connie; which I don't. This was my first time purchasing from a seller. It has left me with a very bad impression of the quality offered by the seller chosen to fulfill this order. I do not know if I will ever buy from that seller again. I was sold a used book at a new book price. Not cool. I called Amazon Customer Service and a resolution was reached. It is still something I will consider the next time I am going to buy something from a seller. If you are looking for this book, be sure to get it from the author's website. If they say its a new book, it is a new book."
2,Outdated,"This book is an interesting relic of history, but it's now completely outdated. Most of the locations and stores are closed, and much of the ""underground"" information is wholly inaccurate. Only worth buying for that limited set of people who have a nostalgia for what the town used to be."
5,Fantastic!,Fantastic book which made our Asheville experience so much fun! So beautiful! So much interesting historical information! So many places to discover uncovered! High kudos!
5,Awesome Asheville,"""The Underground Asheville Guide Book"" goes beyond typical guides to travelogue-adventure. Presenting the town of Asheville, North Carolina, as more a lifestyle than a destination -- part southern fun, part counter-culture, part la vie boheme -- readers are drawn into a truly unique slice of Americana. Gail Forsyth-Kerr's stunning pics and the overall neo-deco design (props to Charles Rennie MacIntosh) make this book a feast for the eyes as well as the senses. Author Tom Kerr's prose snips, snaps, and does a double-river dance with anecdotes, southernisms, and general vivacity. A must for anyone interested in travelling to Asheville, the South, or just getting a unique slice of American pie."
1,Awful,"If you're the choir, I don't suppose you'd mind being preached to. But this is not a book for the real world or for real people. The author's advice basically consisted of pray real hard and read your Bible more. I found the book to be useless and I didn't appreciate being lectured about how I need to be more religious. Waste of time. Waste of money."
4,A Blast From the Past,"I had forgottten about this 1970's album that I had for years on vinyl. I have since disposed of my vinly collection, and was happy to see that it was available on CD. Sounds great."
4,The Phantom Still Rocks,"I grew up listening to a scratchy version of this album on my brother's phonograph. My siblings and I knew the songs by heart, my childhood favorite being ""Goodbye, Eddie, Goodbye."" Now that I'm older, ""Faust"" makes much, much more sense to me.While some of the tracks are dated, and might not make much sense until you see the movie, the music is still wonderful and somehow magical."
5,Phantom of the Paradise CD.,"Paul Williams provides a dark and quirky tone to the music which underscores this movie. Of particular interest is the song ""Beauty and the Beast (Phantom's Theme)""."
4,This CD Rocks like you've never been Rocked before.,"The first time I ever saw this film was when it came out in 1974, I was eight years old. My first reaction was WOW! It blew me away. I never saw a movie like this before and the music just added to the intensity. Then several years later I just happened to find it on record. Recently I was wondering if it was out on CD. After looking from store to store I couldn't find it anywhere. Then it dawned on me to try to look for it on the internet. Wouldn't you know it, I just found it. Leave it to amazon.com to have it. This place has eveything.I can even say that this is my favorite cult film with a soundtrack that rocks. This is a must buy for people who like things that are weird."
3,Phantom of the half paradise !,"Sure, this is a great score. The songs are marvellous. But there's much more music in this movie. Where are the interludes, the narrative string quartet ? A new complete edition please !!!!"
2,For the hardcore fan,"This cd has so many outstanding reviews these comments may seem at odds. Paul Williams is without doubt an outstanding composer, with many brilliant works penned for many artists. This sound track is not a great example of this talent. There are one or two tracks that carry the distintive PW sound but by and large it's hard to like without having viewed the movie and even then it's ok at best. Many of the performances are pitchy and one can't help feeling, a little amatuerish. If your a hard core fan buy this and enjoy, if your a moderate or new fan or just plain curious don't start here. There are much better offering of Paul Williams work on his other discs"
5,simply the best,"The Phantom Soundtrack is like Golddust here in England, but what a treat.A beautiful soundtrack for a most Excellent film. this should be avaliable in every Cd store in the world. anybody who has not heard this sountrack has not heard music."
4,Help!,"I guess I am not the only one who found the two books fascinating and read them both only to find that there was not a third! If anyone figures out where the elusive end to the trilogy can be found, I would love to know, or even how to contact the author... I found the book fun, energizing and delightful to read but I never saw the last. Did she really not ever finish? What a tragedy! Email me ... if anyone knows anything! -Bridget"
3,?????,"I did like the book, but what I really want to know is whatever happened to the third book? As far as I can tell, the author never finished the series. It has been forever. Does anyone know if there will ever be an end to this series? It just left you hanging after the 2nd book."
2,"Great Yarn, Very Overpriced","I've loved working with Lion Brand's Woolease for years and would definitely recommend it for projects that you want to be able machine wash without having that icky 100% acrylic feeling. However, I would consider finding somewhere else to buy it: this yarn is typically $3.50-$4.50 per ball, and is listed at nearly $10.00 by this vendor."
5,Recommend,I would most definitely recommend this product to others. It arrived on time and the product quality was as expected.
5,Nice to work with,I plan on knitting a pair of winter socks with this yarn. I like knitting with Lion Brand's Wool-Ease yarn because it does not tend to split at all and just seems to glide on my needles. I'm currently knitting a sweater from a different colorway of Wool-Ease and have some stashed for a Fair Isle scarf.ETA: I'm now making those socks. The yarn is great to work with. I love the subtle variegation in this colorway. They're going to look great when they're done. I've been doing them Magic Loop & trying them on as I go. They also feel great. I *am* having more trouble with splitting than I usually do with Wool-Ease -- maybe it has something to do with the dyes.
4,6 traits of writing,As a second grade teacher this shows the process that writers do in order to publish their stories. Sometimes the students get a little frustrated when they can't just do the story once. Also this book is a great example of the use of speech bubbles.
1,Trouble in first 4 days,"I purchased a Panasonic PV-DV400 on Memorial Day. This was our first camcorder so we went with Mini-DV since we don't have any exisiting 8mm or analog tapes. The controls are easily learned and fairly intuitive. I had taped about 35 mins. of video and taken a dozen photos on the memory card. All of a sudden, the next time I attempted to record, the viewfinder and LCD had white lines all over and white static on the entire left side. Also, the images appeared very dark in full daylight. It would record, but with all this noise and an unviewable image, both on the tape and the memory card. I called the Panasonic help number in the manual and they immediately said it would require service. I tried it again over the next few days and all of a sudden it cleared up on the sixth day. Other than this obvious problem I liked it. Beware this camera. Mine's back where I bought it."
4,A interesting machine,"The PV-DV400 offers several different digital effects in addition to zoom capabilities. The ""digital mirror"" creates a mirrorlike symmetrical image, while ""strobe"" digitally freezes a series of images. ""Mosaic"" turns the image into a mosaic pattern, and ""slim"" expands the image vertically."
5,bratchild,Such a great deal. My great white hunter wants his little squaw to take care of the tanning for him. It was nice to have a refresher corse. Just don't expect to see me wearing my works!! All kiding aside the book was in perfect condiction and very informative. Thanks.
5,Unusual debut filters Difford & Tillbrook through John Cale,"Though their subsequent albums would take a more staid approach to pop music, this debut is perhaps Squeeze's most interesting effort. Having dismissed the songs they brought to the studio, producer John Cale forced songwriters Difford & Tillbrook to compose a new album on the fly. The result is less highly polished than subsequent releases, but it's filled with a liveliness that would never again be this evident.Cale's production, and the band's arrangements, have a great deal more edge to them than subsequent recordings. The energy of 1978 brings something of a Boomtown Rats' snap to Difford & Tillbrooks fantastically melodic pop.Followup LPs focussed more on the pop songwriting and dropped the utter quirkiness of this debut. Which is too bad, as the combination sums to more than the parts."
3,Not quite there yet.,"This is a fun album but for prime Squeeze you need to skip ahead to the next one, Cool for Cats, and then proceed from there. This is mostly the producer's fault. Having said that, it's still worth a listen especially if you want to hear Squeeze not sounding much like Squeeze. It's just a really weird album in their discography. Luckily, it didn't ruin them for the goodness that came later."
2,NOT TYPICAL SQUEEZE,"This is not a typical Squeeze offering. If you love the great hook-filled melodies that made Tillbrook and Difford one of pop music's most endearing song writing teams, you'll be disppointed in this early album. I saw Squeeze in concert a few times, and they cooked. A great rock'n roll band. Here, the performance, vocals, and production are all far below the quality you'd expect from Squeeze. If you listen to the rest of their CD's or albums, you hear a remarkable recording history that spanned over 20 years. If you love catchy pop tunes, try RIDICULOUS, BABYLON AND ON, SOME FANTASTIC PLACE, or one of their compilations or Greatest Hits packages. Great band, brilliant recording artists, fantastic song writers."
3,Good Graphics. Bad Gameplan.,"At first the game is quite fun, the graphics can blow you away at points but after and hour or two you will become bored or completley stumped. The Graphics and music make it very pleasurable to see but the game is truly puzzling. With little explanation you are asked to solve puzzles without any clue of what to do. Most"
3,Mixed Bag,This game has spectacular graphics---makes playing it [and finishing it] worthwhile. But the navigation is difficult and clues [?] are frequently vague. A lot of trial & error solutions.
2,"An ""E"" Rating?","I found this to be an average puzzle-solving adventure game, much like many of the other games of the same caliber that are out there. I did, however, question the rating on the game. The game holds an ""E"" rating which states that it is suitable for any person age 6 and older. I believe that a young child would not be able to solve many of the puzzles and challenges in the game, unless they purchased a cheat book or went on the internet (like I did) to get hints for the puzzles. Plus, some of the creatures encountered in the game may frighten younger audiences, and a scantily-clad priestess in the Maya scene may not be suitable for younger eyes. You can use your discretion on this, but I gave the game a two-star rating."
3,so confused,"Beginning, I really liked this game. But towards Ireland and Tibet I became so puzzled and frusturated over the clues. Also my computer is too high tech so I can't enjoy the mini movies in each scene. The animation is truly breathtaking but how could anyone say they enjoy this when they don't get the full gamer experience and weird clues that I've totally given up on..."
2,too few clues,"It's too bad Dreamcatcher Games' games all have the exact same gameplay. I think they're trying to re-create the style of Myst, but they don't realize that there is a subtle art to making a game like this. The first rule they violate is to make the game possible to figure out on your own. They provide almost no clues for any of the puzzles (It's impossible to figure out where to use the crystal ball in each place unless you try every single screen). They make it so difficult you pretty much have to use a walkthrough. I was able to get through Myst without any help, but I didn't last five minutes in Beyond Atlantis.The only good part about the game is the way it looks. All the worlds look amazing (which is good, because you'll be spending a lot of time in each one).Unless you like to spend countless hours trying to figure out puzzles with absolutely no clues at your disposal, you should avoid this one."
3,Is It Just Me?,"First off, let me just say the graphics and music in this game were absolutely wonderful. Very relaxing and almost magical in a calming way. However, whatever calm relaxing feelings that our conjured up through graphics and music quickly fade away in frustration. Walk-through's are a must have for this game, not because the puzzles are that difficult, but because the game doesn't give you enough clues to figure out what, where or when you are supposed to do something. Simple instructions or hints from the many dialogue conversations would really help this game along. I was also a bit disturbed by the 'fish-bowl' look of some of the many character's faces. The Mayan & Celtic worlds were fascinating and a lot of fun, but frustrating in areas. I still haven't finished the game because I missed one of the ""have to do"" actions and I don't feel like redoing everything. Get this one on sale. It's worth the time to play, but don't expect to get through this one without some outside help."
2,It's ok...on a rainy day and you have nothing else to do...,"I enjoy adventure games, but since I'm so busy I can only play a few of them a year, and so I choose only to play the best. Unfortunately this game does not fit into what I call ""QT with my PC"" This game incorporates annoying voice acting where the words do not match with the speakers mouthes, and I found that transitions to be slow and boring. The puzzles were alright though they were not very informative and there wasn't much humor in the game. Overall, I just thought it was a good concept that could have been a better game, but just wasn't exciting enough. ..."
3,player,"It has a good beginning... but is hard to go anywhere because the clues do not lead any particular direction. The player must go back and forth between locations but the player simply ends up in a loop with no solution. The graphics and pictures are nice, but that is the best thing about the game since no direction is given from the clues."
3,It's a great game... If you can get it to work!,"I loved the graphics and music in the game... until it timed out. Dreamcather's website has a list of things to do if this happens(So it must happen quite a bit), but not one worked on my machine. Beware of this problem, I have heard that a few of the other Dreamcather games also do this."
3,Not for everyone,"I'm not sure how good or bad this game is. I can't make it past the first 5 min. If you are prone to motionsickness or have vertigo DON""T get this game. I was sick for hours after."
1,Ugh - don't do it,"This game was so icky I didn't even finish it. The rendered characters all appeared to have some sort of unhealthy skin condition, and tended to rock back and forth while delivering their bad voice bits. The locations were pretty, but the node-to-node navigation was extremely frustrating. Some of the puzzles weren't too bad, but others were pretty far fetched. Between the creepy characters, the dizzying navigation and the inane puzzles, I just couldn't bring myself to continue."
2,"It was boring, yet you feel a need to go one,","The graphics were great, but it was difficult to figure out where to go. The puzzles were exrtremely hard, and there didn't seem to be much of a point to the game. So, if you come across this game, think twice before being grabbing it off the shelf. However, if you like Puzzle games, such as Myst, then you would probably enjoy the shere boringness of going in circles around a stream or trying to talk to a giant spider, or pheraps you would like walking in a sheep's field? Maybe talking to monks? Watching a fox chasing chickens always excites me! And don't forget the shadow outside the chinease gates, too scary for words, and remember that spinning the turtle in circles is the way out!!"
1,Puzzles are not intellectually challenging,"I bought this game because the reviews said the puzzles were as interesting and intellectually challenging as the 7th Guest; but it is far less so. Too many of its puzzles require guess-work and don't require logical analysis. Also there are too many ""jump-though-hoops"" steps, i.e. completely random use of an object, not based on any clue or information from any of the characters. In fact, to get the 5th level, I had to go to a hint guide to find that I had to go back through all four previous levels and click on one completely random place in each level. Yeah I want to waste my time, but I'd at least like to use my brain while doing it."
3,At least it looks good,"I agree with the reviewer that said that. This game gives you very little to work with in way of clues. You wander randomly through locations and try to figure out what to do. I don't know, maybe I'm just not as smart as some people are, but the puzzles seem very hard to me. The concept is very intriguing though, and the graphics are beautiful. All together it is not a bad way to waste your time. I liked the mayan place, and how they incorporated in China and Tibet and Ireland. And I love games with good graphics, so this game is very nice to look at."
2,Please,"Were Can i find a walkthrough for this game? i mean yesh it gives you no type of background info that would lead you to find the answer, at one ppoint (xilgalga rainbow thing) i started looking at the sky for clues, and that lil bat is uglier then snot, but anyways back to the walkthrough, please if u know were to get one from email me at firebat02@hotmail.com or pschofreak@hotmail.com (pscho spelled as it is)"
2,This is a miss.,"I have liked every game Dreamcatcher has ever released, but this one was a little tough to swallow. In typical Dreamcatcher fashion, the graphics are wonderful and the music is very relaxing and laid back. I think the reason for the calming music was the fact that this game is very annoying. Now. I consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games, and if I get stuck, I call a couple of friends and we work these out together. But neither of us liked this game very well. the clues aren't detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious. You don't know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence. Very annoying. when they speak to you, it's like your speaking to Confuscious. Very hard to discern the clues they are giving. My suggestion is spend your money on another Dreamcatcher game: Traitors Gate. That is a game worthy of all point and click puzzle solving game players."
2,Annoying!,"Everything in this game is confusing, especially with no instructions. The game almost expects you to know what to do and how to solve clues. I struggled through this game for a long time and could not understand what was going on. The only thing I give this game credit for, is the graphic's and exotic and ancient soundtrack, otherwise, this game is needle in a haystack!"
3,"Beautiful imagery, flawed game play","Typical of Dreamcatcher games, the graphics in this game are stunning. The game play, however, is not very smooth. With several of the puzzles I didn't know what I was supposed to be doing (and this wasn't part of the puzzle) or the basic instructions for the puzzle. For instance, one puzzle had me construct a landscape by moving squares around. After 2-3 hours I finally logged on to a hint board and found out that by right-clicking on the pieces I could rotate them. A basic piece of instruction not highlighted anywhere in the game or the manual. Other puzzles were illogical. Animation sequences are somewhat entertaining. Game stability is excellent. Plot is a bit tired--you're the chosen one, travel to four exotic locales to fix the wrongs of ages ago."
4,Pricy but very cool,Product arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Product was exactly as described. These caps seem over priced for all they are: two plastic caps for the top and base of the Garmin 550 GPS... but they are very cool. GREAT TRANSACTION - pricy item. A
4,Garmin Custom Caps,"Just received my custom caps, they look great. Problem, the picture and order indicated that all four designs would be in the package for the $18.95, no where was there a place to choose which set you wanted. When my order arrived it contained only two sets of caps. Looked everywhere to see if there is some type of customer service contact info, but found none. Feel I was ripped off. Not sure if I will deal with this company again. Only good thing was they sent the custom cap set I really wanted."
4,"""Box Like the Pros"", Joe Frazier","This is a good, basic overview of boxing, written primarily for the layperson. It is a quick read and excellent for the beginner or novice. I bought it, read it, and gave it to one of my new trainees to supplement our training. Every new person to boxing should read this book. I highly recommend it."
5,Bormioli glassware (14 oz tumblers),"The perfect drinking glass - elegant but practical (dishwasher safe). In my opinion, these are comparable to glassware costing several times the price. Their only drawback that I can think of is that they are probably too fragile for use with kids - even a slight tap against anything hard will break them."
2,Not what I thought,"I have owned Bormioli glassware for a number of years and have always been very pleased with their styling and durability. In trying to find a close match to some beloved glasses, I chose these Bach 14-oz. glasses hoping they would blend with my older, (I thought)similarly styled glasses. Unfortunately they are not only very different, I think they are oddly styled. They have a very heavy bottom, are wider at the bottom than the top (both difficult to see from the photo) with a weird visible transition in the glass halfway up the side where the thickness of the glass changes from hefty to thin/delicate at the top. Odd is the word because this style has a wider bottom than top, and is half heavy and half thin/delicate.I had hoped for glasses that had a less heavy/thick base and sides that were straight and of a consistant thickness - top to bottom.I returned them for a refund which I received but I'm still looking for glassware!!"
5,A fascinating and beautiful piece of rock and roll.,"If you like Supertramp, there's no telling if you'll like their first album. If it weren't for the vocals, you might never guess it was them. But it's great. It's very moody and mostly sad, but has driving rhythms and haunting melodies. As you might expect, there's a somewhat amateurish sound to it. The mixing is a far cry from their masterpiece, Crime of the Century. But this album has an intimacy and personality that makes it a classic in my stack. There are many gems on this album, and you won't have to wait for them to ""grow"" on you. Every tune is creative and original, both musically and lyrically. If you're collecting Supertramp, DON'T save this one for last! It's a fascinating and beautifully performed piece of rock and roll."
4,Perfect set for the price,"This chair and ottoman set was the perfect addition to my living room. I live in a small apartment and only had my couch and desk chair for seating. This chair is perfect as it's small yet feels roomy to sit in and is very comfortable. It's also light, so it's easy to move in front of my computer if I want to watch videos online. It was also easy to put together, although one support screw wouldn't work properly so I had to glue it, but it still feels very sturdy. Just to note--the actual color of the cushions were a bit more cream-colored and not as white as the picture suggested, but I was happy about that."
3,Maltese plush is OK,I use this toy as a decoration only. It looks better in the pictures. The stuffing is distorted and I debated returning it--decided to keep it. The price at the pet store I patronize is twice as much.
5,Great!,"I own it, it's perfect! Looks just like a real Maltese puppy! Absolutely wonderful! Even cuter than the picture!"
1,Not satisfied,Pros:the color is pretty accuratethe price is okCons:it shedsI'm pretty sure the dog in the picture was professionally groomed to look a little cuter. The toy I got in the mail didn't look as good. Its fur is all messy. Feels like there is some sort of hair product on it; kinda oily/greasy.
2,Very disappointed,"Much like many of Aurora's larger stuffed animals, the one I received doesn't look anything like the pictures you see on Amazon. The dog I received is all white with none of the shading on the fur that gives it the realistic appearance. It doesn't even look like the same stuffed animal. Very disappointing."
1,Not as pictured,"Okay this thing does not look anything at all like the picture. I bought this as a gift and I'm almost embarrassed to give it. It was received extremely smushed and ratty looking. On top of all that the shipping and handling was pretty expensive in my opnion bringing the overal cost of this tiny little 12"" toy to way more than I think it is worth. I had to give it a bit of a hair cut and move around the toys stuffing for it to even closely resemble this picture and you know what even after all that it still looks nothing like it. I have to forwarn others that if you are not picky and don't care if it looks like the picture than go ahead an buy this but don't expect it to look as cute as it does in the picture."
4,Cute but eyes too big,"The synthetic hair is soft and the design looks realistic, but the eyes are so much bigger than real Maltese that makes it less realistic. I prefer the eyes to be smaller like a real Maltese.The quality is just so so. The rim of one eye is not smooth because a hard fabric sticking out along the rim of one eye. One side of the nose is a bit higher than the other side, not balance.Anyway, I still like the design and I let my Maltese sleep with this toy."
1,Disappointed in size,"I was looking for a full sized replica of a bichon frise that could be used for demos. This one is NOT even close to the size claimed. If you measure from the tip of the tail (stretched backwards) to the tip of the nose, you barely get 12"". Dogs are measured from the ground to the top of the withers. This one measures about 4 1/4"" at the withers and about 7 1/2 inches to the top of the head. The eyes and nose are a hard material that could cause a child or dog to choke if torn off."
4,Christmas puppy,"this is such a cute, snuggly puppy. I'm sure it will be years of cuddly enjoyment to someone who can't have a real puppy"
5,Stuffed toy Maltese,It is darling! My granddaughter is going to love it for her 2nd birthday. It looks so much like my dog.
3,Not nearly as cute in person,"This puppy is very soft, but the one I have has eyes that are off-set (and a little too big for the dog), making it look quite odd. I tried to groom the hair around it to make up for the strange eye placement, but nothing could help it. It's a shame, because the picture of it is very cute."
5,cutie pie,this puppy is just like the picture . it came ahead of time . the price was a good deal . i love to cudle with it . i giv e this 5 stars
3,Cube&Clinton Groove,this was a Pretty Good Duet to me.it was a good balance&they worked together rather well together here.Pretty Good.
4,A must CD if you followed this Band,They found and used the flat master to re-master and results are excellent. Stay away from all other re-issues on this album unless your intent is to compress to a MP3 mid bit level file...
5,Music To Feed The Senses.,"""A Salty Dog"" original release date May 1969.This is music for headphones and a certain state of mind. And if you think that is pretentious, just listen to the album, then decide.Personal favourite tracks.A Salty Dog.The Wreck of the Hesperus.Pilgrim's Progress.Boredom.If on liking this album, I would recommend their eponymous first album and, ""Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra"", which in my opinion includes the best live track ever, ""Conquistador""."
5,Agreed: One of the Greatest Albums of All Time!,"I want to agree with the previous review. This is simply stated one of the finest ""rock"" albums of music ever recorded. Every song is a gem. The songs on this album are beautifully composed and performed in a way that transports the listener. I've had this album for more than 20 years and I've never gotten tired of it. The album flows and enchants. There's a lot of emotion here, the kind of emotion that reaches deep into the heart of the listener. Its hard to describe music with words. Especially this album which transcends most categories and superlatives."
4,An Unusual Band,"Procol Harum's body of work stands out as one of the most creative of late 60's and early 70's. Any one of their albums is worth a listen, but I retain a soft spot for 'A Salty Dog'. The title song is (in my opinion) unique in their catalog, sounding like it could have been pulled from a 19th century musical, a wonderful track--- and from there you travel from one interesting song to another. Other favorites include 'Too much Sea Between Us, 'The Devil Came From Kansas, 'The Wreck of the Hesparus'. I rate the album as a 4 because not all tracks are classics---but it's hard to see going wrong with any of Procol Harum's work. They were always inventive. A worthwhile addition to anyone interested in British bands of the sixties/seventies."
5,"Great album, on CD, after all these years!!","My husband has been carrying around this album on LP, moving from place to place, hoping sone day he could ge someone to copy it to CD so he could listen to it again.When I gave him the CD to day he was extremely happy.I had never heard it before.It is great!!! I am listening to it right now.Boy from the country has always been a song that I loved. John Denver recorded it years ago. I did not know it was a Michael Martin Song."
5,Alvin Ailey:The Man and His Geniuis,"I had the unique pleasure of being awarded a dance scholarship to the Ailey School when it was located in the Minskoff Theater Builidng on 44th st and Broadway in New York.This was back in the early 1980's. This training has stayed with me unitl this day, almost 25 years later. Alvin Ailey would drop by the classes from time to time to see what was going on with the students. Unpretentious and down to earth, he was a sight to behold. This book brought those memories back to me in vivid detail.Mr. Ailey has his demons for sure. His vision of a multi-racial dance company, which performed to not only the music and interpretations of Mr. Ailey's experience of being an African American gay male in this country, yet also the experience of what it meant to be truly human; warts and all.In the words of William Shakespeare, taken from the play MacBeth, ""Heaven rest him now"". Bravo, Alvin Ailey."
1,Horrible excuse for a movie.,"I'm wondering if the people who gave this 5 stars watched the same movie I did. Oh my god, there are no words to describe how bad it was. The acting was horrid, the picture quality looked like that of a camcorder, there was no plot, and it was just stupid.If you like movies that are so stupid they make you laugh (not in a good way) then this is for you. Otherwise I wouldn't waste my money. It's not even worth what it would cost to rent it."
3,"A "" Spider Baby"" For the new fans ...","BLOOD SHEDStarring: Terry M. West, Mike Lane and Michael Gingold.Written & Directed by: Alan Rowe Kellywww.thebloodshed.net..."" Kind of reminds one of Sid Haig's SPIDER BABY !""Parts of `Addams Family, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Little Lulu', Really not too meshable.One seriously has to wonder what this cast thought at auditions,first day of filming...This is painful to watch...NOT because it has no artistic merit,It REEKS Artistic Merit...It questions what you can handle on a minimum pain threshold.One thing to really rub the wrong way of this critic, Micheal Gingold (Of FANGORIA column fame) WTF ???"
4,"Good product, with 1 small flaw, not so good tech support","Good features, Easy to use, bright enough for a good picture from 20 feet away.One problem only: If the DVI cable is too long, or not connected firmly then a GOOD projector will have display problems or show no video at all. BUT the EP910 just locks up, and stops responding to ANY of the buttons (including the power switch!) Even completely removing the power cord, waiting an hour, and reconnecting the power cord, did not ""unlock"" the Projector. Tech support was clueless to solve this problem and suggested returning the product to AMAZON, and get a new one. So I did. But the new one behaved exactly the same."
1,utter nonsense,As usual in these cases facts are concealed and false evidence put up as incontrovertible (all faked). All this was proven false by Carlo Mattogno. Thank God there are still people who keep an open mind and do their own research rather than take the propaganda at face value.
1,Don't waste your money!,"The trial transcripts are available on line (for free!!!!!). Imagine that, you can get an unbiased take on the evidence! Van Pelt gives very compelling testimony (unlike some of the other highly paid ""witnesses"" for the defense) but why pay him again for it?"
1,ll sit down,why is ll fool j still rapping from bad to crack cocaine to steroids yes we seen it all even ll's abs are gettinmg old and howe many timwes can you say you like giving girls oral sex and recruiting j lo for backing vocals is a minus remember she hated blacjk music screw her and this whjole ll project stick to acting.
2,Too bad,"What happened to mama said knock you out or radio, this album is terrible, even R/B & Pop fans are saying this is trash. There is only 4 good songs on this album.It's LL & SantanaFavorite FlavorWhat You WantWere gonna make it"
2,Not that good,"Ll cool J's new album Todd Smith is honestly his worst effort yet. It seems that he quit the whole rap thing to a pop, R/B album. There are few rappers featured on here, it's more of R/B singers. Most of the songs are club bangers and love songs. The reason why I didnt give it 1 star is because there are some tracks I can tollerate. My favorite songs in order:Its Ll and SantanaControl MyselfFavorite FlavorWhat You WantWe're gonna make itIf you want Ll's best album, buy Mama said Knock you out or Radio."
2,"Not true hip hop, but has a few song hip-pop/R&B songs","His best most recent album was Mr. Smith. It had real lyics and the wicked"" Hey Lover"". This new album has a few pretty good R&B; songs""Favorite Flavor"" is similar to ""around the way girl"" which is a good thing.""best dress"" is OK, it's a reused beat from Nelly's ""Play It Off""Horrible songs are "" Preserve The Sexy"" the chorus is horrid. ""What You Want"" is soo bad too.I don'ty know what's up with this album.I really don't get why nobody realizes how ""Control Myself"" is a whack rip-off of Missy Elliott's ""Loose Control""Overall a few good hip-pop/ R&B; songs but not a true hip hop album for the hardcore fans. Not really worth the money."
1,WHAT THE @#*!,"Only one tra... @#*! THAT! NOTHING caught my ear on this release. This is not the L.L. That I grew up listening to. I know that he's doing clean albums for the kids. Nothing's wrong with that. 1990's ""Mama Said Knock You Out"" was clean, but it was and STILL is a GOOD album! Damn L do you need Canibus to get back in your ass to make you get your swagger back?GOT DAMN!"
2,Nothing really sticks with this album.................,Big disappointment. Some tracks sound dated and some too soft.The chorus on Red Dress is cool though.L also played himself at the MTV awards. I really can't see LL taking a back seat to 50 for long.
3,Probably the only good cd out there.,"This is LL Cool J's 12th album to the 1985 classic radio, ll has sexier songs and a sexy body like he did in 10, with a decent new look, better writing, better looks and better scenes, this is a very decent and a nice album, a Marginal thumbs up for me."
5,AWESOME,This CD is great. I bought it yesterday and love it. There is a lot of variety on this cd. There are slow songs like Down The Aisle and Freeze and more upbeat songs like It's LL And Santana and Control Myself. My favorite songs are1. Freeze2. #1 Fan3. I've Changed4. Down The AisleAfter all these year's LL's still got it.
4,Good foundation for 7 card stud play.,"I found this a great book to build a solid foundation for people getting into seven card stud. Written in a way that's easy to grasp, but contains a lot of important information for the up and coming player."
4,Good Book to get started with 7 card Stud,This is my first book at 7 card stud.The book had 42 lessons and it will improve your game at the low and medium level.The language is very simple.It will give you good understanding of the game.Good buy.
1,Waste of time,This book is totally worthless!!!Does NOTHING more than tell you to fold if you're dealt 2-5-7 off-suit and to stay and play if you're dealt 3 Aces.
5,SOLID,"This cd takes me back. When I was stationed in Germany, I made a very close friend in an Italian guy who was stationed there at the same time. We both loved our music. One day he pulled out this vinyl of some guy I had never heard before. I was floored. The music was stirring and the vocals were dynamic. Since that time, the songs from this album have been in my head. I listened to the sample tracks and knew right then I had to have this CD. My MP3 is going to be giving this one a lot of playing time.This is kind of a jazz, soul, pop thing. I highly recommend it. A must have for your audio collection."
5,Gino's finest hour!,"With no less than 5 hits, this is without a doubt Gino's finest hour! Appoloosa, The river must flow, I just wanna stop, Brother to brother, (and my favorite) Wheels of life, make this album a must for anyone who wants to start buying Gino Vannelli cds."
2,Croon & Swoon,"Corny lyrics, corny arrangements, too much in love with Major7th and 11th chords ( like BbMaj7 over C in the bass). Good studio musicians, no doubt- especially slap bass, leads and drumming.I just cant get past the over-emoting crooning. ""I just wanna stop""- ok style-less pop ballad."
5,"If you love rock, funk and jazz you'll love this.","I first heard the song ""Brother to Brother"" on the radio while driving home from college in the late 70's. I was totally blown away by the musicianship of the players and the craftmanship of the writers. Here was a recording that blended rock, jazz, and funk together in a way I'd never heard before. I went out and bought the album and have not stopped loving it since. It is by far one of my all time favorite albums. Gino has managed to combine together in one recording many of my favorite musical styles. Thanks Gino!"
5,great cd,"super cuts on this cd.great music from a great human being.was lucky to meet him a few months before his passing,such a humble man R.I.P."
4,For my Dad,"All my Dad wanted last year was the first Shogun Assassin. THis year I got him the second one and he didn't even kow that it exsisted. He was totally surprised, and completly pumped. Thank you for helping me find something that my Dad would like and enjoy!@!"
4,GREAT MOVIE,"FOUND THIS MOVIE WATCHING ""KILL BILL"" (THE ONE WHERE BILL DIES): Right before the final scene. the daughter ask if she can watch SHOGUN ASSASSIN's before she goes to bed.I had to actually find the movies TRANSCRIPTS to find out what she said; b/c it was kinda muffled when she said it. (sayin that to show how committed I am/was to finding movies other movies reference)...Found it here, and many many other (Shogun Assassin 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.....)They have MOST of the WU-TANG samples for their interludes.I LOVE IT!!"
2,This DVD was dark and hard to view,Though I like the stories in this series I was disappointed in the quality of the DVD. The picture was dark and hard to view.
2,Frustrating at the start. Hopeless by the end.,"The graphics are rich and interesting as well as the sound. Thats where it ends. Controls were difficult to use. Clues to puzzles, non existent. You waist alot of time running around trying to figure out what to do. After the first hour of game play I gave up and used a walkthrough. The plot is a linear sequence of scenes (about 11 in all). Once you leave a scene you cannot return so if you forget something in scene 3 that you need in scene 11 - well tough luck. You have to start over. The scenes present puzzles that become increasingly difficult as you progress. Unless you have a lightning fast processor you won't be able to complete the adventure. Game speed will get bogged down, game controls will be sluggish, you can't draw weapons fast enough, you can't run to escape a threat, etc. Don't waist your money."
2,Loved the Movie-The Game Was Disappointing,"I have played Riven, Myst, Journyman III and feel I have a little experience under my belt. Time Machine started off with a great storyline and graphics. I found it difficult to navigate the character and to solve the puzzels. Two evenings trying to get off the first level disappointed me. My time is valueable, too and a game should not be so inept that it keeps you from progresing in the very beginning! Movement was difficult and could have resulted in carpel-tunnel syndrome! Give me a mouse to use! If you buy it- good luck!"
4,"A ""Time Machine"" review","I think that this is a really super game!True, it does get a little boring after a while (a week or so), but that would only be if you were stuck. This game is most fun when played with hints, or a trusty walkthrough close at hand. All in all, I love the fact that is takes brains rather than the click of your mouse to successfuly complete the game.The graphics are in no doubt superb, and the plot is almost easy to follow if you talk to the right people in the game.It must have took a lot of imagination to think up such a delightful game!"
2,Uh-oh,"If you have played some good quality games, you will be disappointed by this one. It's too bad because the basis of this game is a good one and a time machine alone could be a great tool towards what could be quite the adventure. But these possibilities are not achieved by this game. You can not move around freely and the controls can be difficult. Your kids might enjoy it but if you are looking for a whole lot of fun, try Myst, Atlantis or Blade Runner."
2,opn the second episode...,"I have a question, on the very beginning of the second episode, when he is trying to get to talk to the top monestery dude. How do I get there?? I don't get it. Anybody, help!"
5,"a ""must have"" for those interested in educational equality","This book offers a broad introduction to the sociological study of education. Having purchased the first edition, I was happy to see the many updated chapters in the second edition. The authors have done a great job selecting key classical pieces as well as recent scholarship in the area, particularly relating to racial and class-based inequality in education. Anyone who cares about educational equality--parents, teachers, students, politicians, etc--should have this book on their shelf as a reference!"
2,Not as good as the original,My son loves Harry the Dirty Dog and I admit I do too! While on vacation at the beach we came across Harry By the Sea and I had to buy it for him. My excitement was short-lived when I read him the story that night. It has a very poor story line. I was bored until I finally got to the end and tired of seeing Harry covered in a mess of sea weed.
3,A little shocked,"I have read Hary the dirty dog to my kiddos several times and I love it, This book was cute in the beginning but I was not happy that they referred to a lady as ""fat"" in it. I realize that the book has been around for 40 years and that it is about a cute puppy that gets covered in seaweed to keep cool from the sun, but they should of not used that wording. I am disappointed that our children's book today have words like stupid, fat, dumb, ugly in them. I think stories should be about caring, learning, sharing, and speaking up for their beliefs..not about calling people hurtful names. Sorry Harry by the sea, you won't be in our night time routine anymore."
1,Harry By The SEA,The book smells extremely musty---like it has been in a basement for 29 years. It smelled so bad I simply could not give it to the child I bought it for. Stunningly disappointing!
4,Sam I Am Says Human-Pups Will Love Harry!,"Two paws up! Comical and heart-warming!Read Sam I Am's review of the Harry books and more good reads at:[..]Cheers,A Blogger Puppy With a Love for Kids Books"
1,Text missing,"Strongly recommend buying a used original printing rather than this book which is a very poorly made facsimile copy. Whoever was making xerox copoies of the original did not take care to do it properly with the result that text is often cut off at the inner margin, making reading very awkward. Having reached page 104 I discovered that the next page was numbered 153. There are 49 pages of text missing - accounting for most of chapter 9. I regret not having discovered this before I made my own markings in the book as I would have certainly returned it.The work itself deserves a careful reading by those interested in the study of psychopathology, modern culture, and religion."
4,Nice Bag,"If you don't have many accessories this is a really nice camera bag.If you have a standard point and shoot with a fully retractable zoom lense this is the bag for you. It will have ample storage for your camera, memory cards and batteries. This bag has one moveable divider so you can adjust the compartment size for you camera.If you have a camera with any kind of lens adapter or if you have quite a few extras, I would highly recommend a bigger camera bag."
5,Using with Powershot A20,"I bought this camera bag at the same time I bought a Canon Powershot A20. I'm impressed with the quality construction- while I wouldn't hurl the bag against a brick wall without some trepidation, I'm feel confident that dropping it won't harm my camera too terribly much. There's a lot of padding here.The actual camera is a lot smaller than the bag proper, so I appreciate that the divider in the main compartment velcroes into place, ensuring that I can give the machine as snug a fit as I want, leaving the rest of the ample space for assorted extras."
5,excellent,excellent read of the actual texts throughout church history. the use of original documents ensure you dont read edited material that have be redacted.
5,great,"It was just what it was advertised to be. I received VERY prompt service and it was much appreciated. Thanks, Carla"
2,Dracula Resurrection,"Very, very, dissapointing. The graphics are great but the story line and game play are menial. The puzzles are not challenging at all and the game is too short. (about 3 hours of gameplay) Save you money and buy something else."
2,A bit too short,I must say this game had great 3D graphics. The only problem was that the graphics slowed the game down. This game dealt too much with just searching around the area for things that can be used. The game needed more puzzles to solve. Moving around from place to place took too long. Then just as it was getting good the game ended without a puzzle to solve. But I did have fun playing it.
3,Good so far......,"I just bought the game and it is going fast. There are a few glitches in the game, but the graphics are great. It is rather easy if you are a fan of Myst. I do recommend buying it, but try to see if the price drops first."
4,Its inexpensive fun,While the game was not full of compex puzzles it is by far a funner evening than sitting around watching Television. It is a very good adventure game and for someone just starting out it is perfect. You get results in a short time and feel a sense of accomplishment. Hey you spend 25 bucks going to a movie that last 2 hours...spend 15 and get 6 or more hours of fun with someone you love. I would suggest everyone buy this game...I like games that don't require a shoot out and this is that game. Do it...spend the 15 dollars..
4,Pretty good,I just finished the game. It was very interesting plot. the puzzles and finding your clues are fairly easy with only 2-3 challegaing ones in it. There are many ares to explore and advance to the next level. The only problem I had was you could not move the mouse or keyboard during the animation or the game would stall and you would have to reboot. This is a great game for people getting started in action games. It only took me about a day's work to finish. The end was great and left it open to a sequel to the game.
3,easier than the last sanctuary,"I have solved both dracual games now.i definately think resurrection is easier than the last sanctuary.I like sanctuary a little better but i thought the graphics in resurrection might get the edge.I give sanctuary 4 stars and resurrection 3 stars.I liked how certain parts of resurrection were also seen in sanctuary like the mine,the cemetery,and the courtyard at dracula's castle.I have several computer games and will get more.I have solved king's quest-mask of eternity,both dracula games and cameron files-secret at loch ness.I give loch ness a 3 star and king's quest a 5 star."
3,Dracula Resurrection,"Well, the game has incredible animation. I couldn't get over it. The story line is good and the characters have a good sinister vibe. The game is also kind of spooky, which is great. The problems with the game are that it is too short and easy. The animation saves this game from getting bad reviews. If you like games like Myst, then this game is good to get, but try to wait for the price to drop before you decide to buy it. If you solved the puzzles in Myst and Riven, then this game is too easy to be true. I happened to lime this game except for the fact that it was too short. If you happen to get stuck in the game, just retrace your steps and you wil find the answers. It is a great game to get, but wait for the price to go down first before you pick it up."
2,a bit too short,The only thing that saved this game was the graphics. On the other hand it also slowed the game down. It took a long time to get from one place to the other. The game mostly focused on finding objects and not solving puzzles. It was more of a patience factor then a intelectual factor for playing this game. I found points in the game where I knew what to do but the area that needed to be clicked was too small and hard to find. Then just when the game started to get fun it just ended without a final puzzle to solve. The puzzles in this game would be more for an elementary school student.
3,OK Game,"This wasn't a very challenging game. I did have to use a walkthrough a few times, but only because the graphics were a little too dark for me to see some items. The characters were very creepy, almost disgusting. But overall, for the price, it was Ok to play. I plan on purchasing the sequel, Last Sanctuary."
3,The game was ok.,"For a Dracula story I expect some gore, horror, and some action. I got only a fair amount of each. Though fun to play, it could have been considerably better. I wasn't impressed by the graphics and the story line did not live up to potential. Once again, I would have to say that it was worth the money even though it fell short in some areas."
3,Not what I expected...,"When I looked at the box in the store, I thought ""Wow! This game looks great, I've gotta have it!"". But when I got home, I found it far too easy. Well, let me rephrase that. The beginning was good and creepy and all, and was hard at times, and I was stuck on certain things. But once you get to the point where you want to be, everything opens up, and it just flows so smoothly. I expected much more of a challenge out of this game. Excellent 3-D graphics and compelling story line, however... I finished the game in about 2 days. Maybe 4 hours of gameplay total. I thought I'd be battling it for weeks! Apparently not. I'd only recommend buying this game if you're interested in a short adventure, or if it was on the clearance rack!"
4,Scary....Chilling.....cool!,"Hey, not bad. A bit freaky at first though, but it makes great sense at the end.Great graphics and entertaining yet tedious puzzles gives this 4/5 stars!"
1,How Boring!,"This game is like a ""paint by numbers""! An arrow tells you where to go. You can't wander around...you ""frame"" around. I like to get into a game, run around, peak around corners, hold weapons and spells, fight off enemies, gain power sources etc. This game lost me within the first 5 minutes. I don't like being limited to movement by the arrows. Maybe I want to look at something across the way...or fall off a cliff (if I wanted to) from losing my balance after being chased by a demon! I want choices!I had those choices, and so much more, in Clive Barkers' Undying and American McGee's Alice! Two of the best games you will ever play, if you want demented, heart pounding terror. Sometimes, in those games, you don't want to peak around the corner, for fear of what you will find...but you do it anyway. Now those are games!"
2,"hm, nice game","it was not what i expected. it's so easy...I'm on the second cd withing two hours. Well, i have to confess that i stuck at library of the dracula a little and don't know what to do. It has some interesting graffics, so well created. Anyhow, it's not one of the best adv.games and i wouldn't recomend it."
2,I'd Rather Be Watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"This was more of a point-and-click movie than a game. With fine graphics and a variety of characters to interact with, I expected more than what this short, easy game offered. While the storyline was interesting to a point (rescue-the-girl is not very original) the end was simply an opening for a possible sequel rather than a satisfying conclusion or even a showdown with Dracula or his henchmen. The most interesting thing to do in this game is to laugh at the unfortunately named character, ""Dorko,"" when she says ""Tremble before the rise of Dorko!"" In short, beginners and/or people who like pretty graphics more than a challenge will enjoy this game--seasoned gameplayers will likely be disappointed."
4,Great game for vampire lovers.,"Mina has returned to Transylvania. You, as Jonathan Harker, must follow her and save her from Dracula. Explore a dark forest, find your way through a mine and a castle full of traps and unknown chambers. Puzzles and riddles will slow you down (kind of), as you work your way closer to saving your wife and defeating the Prince of Darkness.Well, not really. Some of the puzzles are very easy, while others seem VERY hard. But if you examine everything and try your best, you should be able to save your wife. No time limites and no way to die.No ending, either. Better go get the next game!"
4,Very fun game.,"Was this game very challenging? No. But it was a blast to play. The puzzles were very ""real"" and by real I mean that you would find an item and you pretty much knew what you were going to do with it. The puzzle got a little harder once you got to the Castle, but this game only took me about 6 or 7 hours to beat. But the graphics and the cut scene were excellent. The music set the tone for every area you went to. It was very eerie and creepy. I would rate this game closer to 3 1/2 stars because it just wasn't a serious challenge, but for the price it was well worth it."
2,Skip this one if you're looking for a challenge.,"I was extremely disappointed in this game. This was the easiest game I have ever played....it was essentially just a game of connect-the-dots with fancy graphics. There was never any doubt about what you had to do next, or how to solve a puzzle (if you can even call them puzzles). 75% of the time the items that you needed to solve a puzzle could be found in the immediate vicinity.However, this game does have one or two things in its favor (hence two stars instead of one). 1) The graphics and cut scenes were well executed. 2) It had a fairly interesting story. 3) This would be a great game for a beginner- they could get the hang of playing a computer game without getting discouraged."
3,Nectar-Sweet Nostaglia,"I think there's a little of everyone's childhood in this book. The magic part at any rate. I've never lived on a showboat and have no real connection to rivers in general and the Mississippi in particular. There's really very little in the main character with which I personally relate my own history. But the nectar-sweet nostalgia of this story still pulled me in, with its portrayal of a charmed childhood and the inevitable progression into the often harsh bubble-burstings of adulthood. As a novel, the story offers reasonably entertaining and insightful characters and a marvelous setting. Like all of Ferber's works, this one isn't a plot-driven story, and it flags in its second half, due in large part to what feels like a personality transplant for the main character. But, all in all, an enjoyable, if purple, classic."
1,Mislead,This was listed as a book on tape (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection). I want the book not the musical! If I can get the book and return the musical I will write a favorable review.
1,Show Boat,"My mother gave me this book because I like to read ""trashy romance novels"". This book sucked. I detested Magnolia's mother. I hated the racial slurs. The husband was a royal bastard. And the daughter treated Magnolia like a simpleton! But what can I say, she was close to it. Magnolia had no real personality and absolutely no backbone whatsoever. Although she was sweet and I admired how much the loved the river and the theater I could barely stand her at certain times in the novel. I had to force myself to finish the book. Although many of you may disagree with me and certainly the other people who gave reviews do. But I have a right to my opinion and decided that what I thought of this book should be up here to warn off others."
1,Chef Beware!,I ordered this mix in the hope of finding a quick way to make sauce when traveling in my Rv. I made some following the directions on the pak. The sauce never thickened and I ended having to thicken it with corn starch. Not wishing to waste the $5 cost of the mix I ended up adding some of the ingredients I use to make my own sauce. In the end I would have saved time and money by making it from scratch.bbb
5,a must read for any man about to marry or already married!,"People tend to be kinder to strangers, colleagues or friends than to their spouses! This books shows how speaking in a gentle, sincere manner will only enhance a relationship. It's written for men but women can certainly use the advice to speak to their husbands respectfully, as well."
5,Still great after all these years,"I was given the tape of this when it first came out. I loved it and listened to it until it played no more. I have not listened to it in years and decided I 'wanted it back'. And it stands the test of time. A mix of blues, jazz and pop music but with powerful lyrics so often, too often missing in today's music. I have always thought that if it weren't for people like Joan Armatrading there would be no Tracy Chapman's of the world. Her lyrics carry strong messages, create vignettes of our world that tell us who we are and who we want to be. I love this album."
2,disappointed,"I bought this for my preschooler and am very disappointed. There are no chimes or similar reminder of when to turn the page. She cannot read it without my continuous presence to turn the page. It would be okay for children who read, though."
1,"No ""Tone""","For a Read-Along book, they simply missed the point. There is no chime or tone to remind the child when to turn the page and therefore 'read along'. Also, the narrator has one tone and limited voice intonation -- she makes no effort to distinguish between characters. Cheaply edited, not worth the money. See ""Disney's Read Along Collection"" for a better quality product."
2,No chimes,"Not what I was hoping for. There are no chimes to tell the child when to turn the page, and there is not even a hesitation. As an adult reading along, I even have a hard time turning the page before the next page is already read."
5,Our favorite book,"This is a sweet book, plain and simple. It is a father and son bonding story. My wife included a picture of her ""big bear"" and ""little bear"" in the inside front cover.Our 2 year old son enjoys reading the book."
5,Bear Games and More!,"In the fine tradition of his ""Little Bear"" books, Martin Waddell has created another timeless classic for young children and their weary parents. Little Bear wants to play but Big Bear has chores to do. Little Bear ""helps"" Big Bear for awhile, but ends up having to entertain himself... but by the time the chores are finished, Big Bear is exhausted...Barbara Firth has created winsome illustrations that will draw you in and make you feel that being a bear and living in a cave (with a fireplace and ""bear chair"") might not be all that bad.At our house, Big Bear and Little Bear are good friends and are dearly loved... all because of the winning combination of a warm story of a parent-child relationship and the cozy illustrations that accompany it. A lovely book to share with your child and a gentle reminder to parents that this time with little ones is precious (and fleeting)."
4,Lessons learned,"Marin Waddell has a great way of bringing life lessons across without being preachy. I really like the fact that the lessons were for both Little Bear and Big Bear. My son snuggled and listened to this story from the time he was two. He never became impatient or bored. (A lesson in the book) I really enjoyed reading this book to my children. I think it suits the little ones best.Terri ""Hunter"" Ward, Author of One Starry Night and Aunt Tami's Strawberry Farm"
4,Helps teaching an important lesson,"My 25-month old son requests that we read this book (as well as ""Let's Go Home, Little Bear"") very often. At first I wasn't very keen on it; it has a strange rythym and it took a while for it to grow on me.Little Bear wants to play, but Big Bear has things to do so Little Bear must help clean up as well as entertain himself while Big Bear finishes his chores. When all the work is done Big Bear is able to play with Little Bear. My son listens to this book intently and clearly working on understanding that we 'Big Bears' can't always play with him when he wants us to. It's a hard lesson for a little person, and one that I am grateful to this book for helping him to understand. He refers to Little and Big Bear at those times when he wants to play and we can't, and it comforts him to know that he is not alone in having to wait - Little Bear had to, too."
5,"Time to work, and time to play.","You and Me, Little BearLittle Bear wants to play, but Big Bear is busy with things to do. Little Bear helps Big Bear with the work, but soon is sent off to play by himself. But just as there was a time for the Bears to work together, soon it's time for them to play together as well. This story will feel familiar to parents and children alike, and reminds all of us to make time for both work and play."
5,Love for Isaac,"The real predictions of the rapture are on point with Isaac Newton, while all the others fail I take Isaac Newtons 2060 A.D as the earliest possible year for the rapture as the most credible.This book was ahead of it's time, and in a way can make you open your mind a bit on how brainiacs of the past interpreted parts of the bibleA must buy for serious theological study."
3,Great game but kind of hard......at least for me,"I got this game for Christmas and it was the first one of my new games I tried playing.Dont get me wrong im really good at video games. I beat ratchet and clank going commando in 2 days,spongebob movie game in 3 day,my cousins game for xbox dead or alive 3 in 15 minutes (story mode),and a series of unfortunant events in 4 days, must I go on?Anyways for the antigravity thing the main reason I cant beat a race is because my sister keeps on moving into the area im playing in.I think the overall game is okay but it could be better."
1,EyeTOY? I think not!,"Eye Toy anti grav was possibly the worst game I have ever bought! There was some complete false advertising too. The commercials said you could walk around the house and outside and it would still follow you. It definitely doesnt do that! It does just about everything but that. It cahnns you out of 50 bucks it barely works without the right lighting, and can hardly follow your body movement. The first eyetoy and eye toy groove were much better, if you are looking for a good game buy one of those not eye toy anti grav. I sure wish i didn't"
4,great game for kids 4 & up.,"great game for kids and adults. at first it is a little hard to control but with some time playing, it gets easier and alot of fun. i bought it for my 7 year old nephew. we plugged it in and it was ready to go. he had a blast with the jumping, dodging, and hand movement, for tricks, it is a blast. one bit of advice make sure you do the tutorial it makes a big difference. good product and i will recommend it."
3,No Controller Needed,When I first bought this I wondered if it would be hard to do stuff since you are the controller but I found out it is actually quite simple. This game has surprisingly good graphics. It is a good first game for your eye toy. Eye toy allows you to be put inside the game. You really have to practice to get good at this game but it is fun. Great for multiplayer (if it doesnt make you look like an idiot jumping around). Anyone any age can play it. Its a good change from sitting in your chair and pressing buttons. Keeps you exercised but you can get tired out from playing this game. My negative comment is you get tired of jumping around the whole game.
4,pretty fun game,"Basically, if you want a game that gets you off your feet, this is the best thats out there. Its much better than EyeToy Play. Only drawback is that you need good lighting to play."
5,Now playable on the Xbox 360!,"This is great news for people wanting to play this game on their next-gen, hi-def Xbox console! However, to get the emulator code for it, as well as many other Xbox games, the easiest way to do it would be to: make sure you have a CD or DVD burner, log on to www.xbox.com, type in the Search bar, ""Backwards Compatibility"", and find the article that says ""Backwards Compatibility FAQ, which is a little step-by-step section that'll take you to burning all the emulator codes on to the CD and updating them on your Xbox 360 console.Getting to the game, this is the most fun I've had for so long; a great platformer that's fresh, original, and really funny! End of story."
5,The gamers begging for creativity and originality need this game,"There's really not much else to say that other reviewers have not covered. However in a day and age where sequels of established franchises are the norm, Psychonauts is a welcome breath of fresh air.This game is living proof that a developer can stay independent in today's market and still produce a quality title. It's a shame less than 100,000 sold across all platforms. It was easily one of the best games of 2005. I never thought I'd see the day when a title by Tim Schafer would go relatively unnoticed.It's Tim Schafer doing Tim Schafer, and that's never a bad thing."
5,Psychonauts - A Classic,"Psychonauts is without a doubt one of the most incredible games you'll ever play. With unique character design, level design variation, a top notch soundtrack and voice cast, solid and sound gameplay mechanics, and a wonderfully odd story, you won't play many games on the same level as this one.The true brilliance of Psychonauts is how it weaves the story and characters into the environments, which allows for so much variation in each level. Each level in the game feels finely crafted to offer you a unique experience that you'll never forget.The art direction is so inspiring, as it shows not every game needs to look the same. Psychonauts is something that can't be compared to anything else; this is a game that is totally unforgettable from an art standpoint and from an overall standpoint.If you want one of the best platformers ever, Psychonauts won't disappoint."
3,Early Rock Giant/Classic,"Spooky Two is in the top 20 rock albums of all time along with Zep 4, BOC tyranny and mutation, Uriah Heep demons,Grand funk closer to home, Beatles White album, Buffalo volcanic rock, Captain Beyond etc. These guys put out the melodic rock that defined the music. Those early years 1970 were some of the best years in music and in my life. No more do you hear this kind of stuff.Tom"
2,POCO ORIGINAL... OTRO RIO QUE LLEGA AL MAR....,"DE LA PROLIFERACION DE BANDAS ANGLOPARLANTES DE LOS '70,NO ENCUENTRO MOTIVOS PARA DESTACAR ESTA PLACA....UNA MAS Y NADA MAS UE ESO..DESPUES DE TODO, ES MI HUMILDE OPINION....HUMM..HUMBLE PIE, DESCANSA TRANQUILO...."
4,"Heavy man, real heavy","""Spooky Two"" is a classic late sixties early seventies heavy metal album. The band Spooky Tooth sound a lot like early Deep Purple, though their music tends a bit more toward the psychedelic. The shared lead vocals by Gary Wright and Mike Harrison will remind you a little of Robert Plant. There are a lot of good instrumental jams through out the album and the production is first rate. ""Feelin' Bad,"" ""Evil Woman"" and ""That Was Only Yesterday,"" are probably the best tracks, though its hard to choose given the album's heavy consistency. ""Evil Woman"" is a classic of guitar and keyboard fury. A great soundtrack for any retro heavy metal party."
5,An All Time Classic,Every song is a gem. This cd is truly one of the all time rock n' roll classics.
5,Con Hunley Freshman Album,"This was a great first album, every song a winner. They were mostly sad songs but this was a great album."
5,Just a great camera bag,"Mainly I bought this bag because of price and the good reviews. I was afraid it would be on the small side, but I was surprised at how much room there is. More than enough room for my HP315, battery charger, and extra batteries. I love it. Think I may find room for my 35mm Ricoh in there too. The soft sides with a separator in the middle will protect the camera. It has a pouch in the front that holds 8 aa batteries with room to spare. The side mesh panels could hold the batteries, the front pouch the charger, and inside next to the digital camer, my 35mm will fit nicely.Just great for the money."
4,Son of Hellzapoppin',"""Crazy House"" is as entertainingly riotous as ""Hellzapoppin'"". The opening scenes of the film are hilarious, particularly their 'welcome home' at the movie studio. Olsen and Johnson's vaudeville comedy works very well here. Except for the generally unfunny (that is, annoying) presence of Cass Daley (well, you be the judge), a funny, funny, film."
3,Big Band Dance,"Good band, mediocre arrangements and a ""so so"" trumpet player heavy on the loud, brassy side, definitely not in the Harry James/Bunny Berigan class."
3,"Terrible science and crazy women, but tons of fun!","The anatomical mistakes in this book really drive me bonkers. Come on, if you're going to cite a muscle by its proper name, at least get it right! The author seriously needed a reality check by a real doctor and a real cop on many aspects of the plot. I was also irritated by the otherwise brilliant doctor who followed terrible home defense advice given to her by a (dead) man, and then suddenly mimicked the other female characters by making utterly atrocious decisions. That said, I must admit I was hooked by the prose. It wasn't gramatically correct: Instead, it was a convincing, emotional stream of thought. Toyer is well worth reading if you can get past the glaring mistakes. I rated it as a 3 because I am notoriously geeky in that regard. Not-so-picky readers will like it more."
5,One of The Best Live Jazz Albums,"I would rate this as one of the top 5 live jazz albums of all time. Bird and Diz are only together for the first five tunes, but don't let that deter you. They really tear it up on every song and Bird's amazing solo on ""Confirmation"" is probably the highlight. The remainder of the tracks is Dizzy Gillespie with his big band and while those songs aren't as exciting as the ones he does with Charlie Parker, they are still excellent. So if you're a jazz fan and you don't own this, get it. It belongs in every jazz fan's collection."
3,For diehard fans only,"This cd has five tracks of a quintet then ten more of big band music. In the quintet, Parker and Gillespie are in top form, but you can't hear the rhythm section well, especially the piano. The big band recordings don't survive the sound problems. If you are a diehard fan you may want this album. If you are looking for one or two cds that are good well-rounded examples of this kind of playing you might give this one a pass."
4,My grandaughter really likes Morris!,My three year old grandaughter really likes this Morris story. I think she's facinated by some of the problems Morris encounters and the fact that school is the solution.
2,Response to'Morris Goes to School ',The book was in good condition however i was disappointed as it didn't have the neat picture on the front that it showed online. it was a solid yellow without a picture. not very impressive to a child.
5,Great Book!,Great book! My son loves it! He is 4 years old and reading and this is a great book for an advanced beginner reader!
5,Morris Goes to School,"I gave this book as one of my son's 6th birthday thank you gifts to the kids who attended the b-day party.He's in kindergarten, as are all his friends and I found it very age appropriate.They are learning to spell,read and are doing everyday math as is Morris the Moose.This is a great I Can Read book and my sons love to hear me read it to them while my 6yr old points to words he recognizes.Highly recommended!I just wish I had it before he started kindergarten to introduce him to what school is like since he had some anxiety as to going to ""big boy school.""Morris also has to make new friends as did he."
5,Morris makes reading fun,"Couldn't help but put my 2 cents in here. My 3 year old daughter was given this book about a month ago and we've read it at least 5 times a week since.She has a bookshelf full of fun books (pop-up, little golden books, dr. suess etc) but she chooses this book again and again.I just noticed this week that if I start a sentance from the book, she can finish it w/o hesitation. We went thru the entire book this way. At age 3, she's saying things from the book like, ""they are one for a penny"", ""how much money do you have""...hearing a 3 year old talk about arithmetic is also amusing. She can almost recite the entire book, just about word for word, and she's only had it a short while. I can certainly see the potential here and I never say no to reading it. She can now spell cat and is working on dog. It really is all about repetition, and this book allows just enough details to keep parents reading it."
3,Two boys' review: Morris helps ease fears about starting school,"More than anything else, this Morris story helped ease the fears my two sons, now ages 6 and 4, had about starting school. With a childlike innocence, Morris makes simple errors that cause a bit of giggling in the classroom. However, the teacher's gentle direction keeps the other children laughing with Morris instead of laughing at him.I introduced this book into our bedtime reading rotation prior to my sons starting pre-kindergarten and continued to read it for a couple months after they started school. The book had sat on their bookshelf since then but now my eldest son has found it again as he's exploring early reader books. The book's classroom setting gives him common ground from which to build his reading comprehension.In summary, while this book is not as funny as Morris' previous adventures, I still recommend this book if your child is about to begin attending school. The story helps ease concerns about the classroom."
4,Excellent for hiker,"This is a excellent bag for hiker or cyclist who want to travel light but wish to be able to bring along a mini camcoder or camera for those photo moments. The compartment is big enough to hold your camcorder, spare battery and a few filter for your camcorder."
3,rating?,"I realize that this movie is not out yet, but what does it mean that it is ""unrated""I am planning a mother/daughter event for girls from the ages 6-11, would this movie be appropriate?someone from CT, saw it, what do you think?"
5,IT'S ONLY GOOD COZ IT FEATURES SIMPLE PLAN!!!***,"Well. (...)there is no way that we would ever miss this movie because it features the best/hottest band in the whole universe! **SIMPLE PLAN** rocks, especially in this movie. It would have no success without them. Their music brings the movie up to a whole new level!"
2,Pretty bad movie,"Yup. It's bad. And one person said Mary-Kate was fighting a cocaine problem... no. That's just something a few magazines did to get big sales and cause controversy. She's in there for anorexia, and I hope she gets better."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"This is seriously THE worst movie I have ever seen. I don't care if it's inappropriate or not, but it just has completely cliched characters and situations; a lame, lame plot; horrible acting (especially the two ""stars"") and, worst of all, sadly pathetic attempts at comedy. The funniest part of the movie wasn't intentional; it was the (incredibly maudlin) part where the sisters have this ""touching"" conversation full of cliches such as ""you were never there for me!"" and then get mad at each other, and then randomly walk around to music. This was hilarious. Anyway, the ending, sadly, is not MK + A getting run over by taxis but a (can you guess?) happy-ending cliche that is also highly improbable. I don't see why anyone would even want to buy this, but if you're thinking about it, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!P.S. I wish Amazon had let me give it zero stars, or even negative stars...oh well."
5,New York Minute,"I love this movie. It was so funny. My favorite part is well...everything. The main star is Roxi (Mary Kate) Jane (Ashley) The thing about this movie is that it has cool music. Also the main thing is that they go to New York and Jane is late to get this college scholarship to a good school and her other sister is at a concert. And they break up. Then they get together and Jane gets the scholarship. Also Roxi loves music and she has a band. Jane and Roxi are opposites in the start, but then Jane and Roxi become friends at the end. Also they have a good year at the end. Also I forgot to tell you, but they break into a hotel and a boy comes in and say is it my birthday and that's one of the funny parts. You can tell I love this movie.Lauren S., 4th Grader, Holland, PA"
2,Nothing Special,"A total exploitaion of the Olsen twins. Just for the sake of making a movie to make rich people richer. But then again what can you expect, just because they are getting older doesn't mean that their movies still aren't going to appeal to ten year old groupies. No acting, no story line, no plot, no big surprise."
5,I loved NYM!,"I am a huge fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, so naturally I saw the movie at the first showing on the first day it came out. I think they did very well. Me, 12 yrs old, my two friends 13 yrs old, and my mom all loved it. It was humorous, and not too grown-up. We heard younger girls in the theatre leaving afterwards talking about how great it was. I think the plot was good and it was just fun to watch their unique personalities differ and then them become friends in the end. It was touching and inspires girls like me to connect with their family."
4,Pretty good,"This movie was cute, it had a good story line, the actting was good. There were some funny thing's in it. I especialy liked the part where Mary-kate's person is up on stage and quotes Avril Lavigne. The movie had stupid thing's in it too. Like Levy's person was a little stupid. And there's a scene where there is a kung foo fight scene. A few skimpy clothes but that's about it. It good, I might buy it when it goes on sale. Any Mary-kate and Ashly fan would probbly love it"
4,"""Made me fart"" - My friend's daughter","Many of you know how much time I spend with my friend's daughters. I babysit them for money, but I'm also their friend and a sort of ""second mother/big sister"". One's a teen and one's a preteen - no, you can't see their pictures so hold the emails! They have long been on the fence about the Olsen twins, while I have found them to be model Young Republicans. I can only pray that Mary-Kate overcomes her eating disorder and rediscovers the joys of rich food (I know I do!).When we watched ""New York Minute"", I knew I would enjoy it fully. Andy Richter provides extreme amusement, and the girls themselves acquit themselves nicely in their first non-kiddie flick. I am convinced this film is more for an older, reflective audience. Why? Because my friend's daughters dubbed the movie ""fart-worthy"", our little code term for when a movie reeks. I did even see a small stain on the couch where one of them was sitting, which I still haven't gotten out."
1,Absolutly Rubbish!,"I thought this movie was a waste of time, the olsen sisters cant act and should just forget about trying to make money this way. Also i think that the directing was also bad and all in all it was a waste of money to go and see."
2,NO plot!!!,"This movie had no plot whatsoever! Definetly MK&A's worst movie. Boring story (no plot!), corny scenes and even a terrible song at the end. BORING!!!!"
1,Boring,"This movie was pretty lame. They missed several prime oppurtunities to put in something funny. I've seen Mary-Kate and Ashley do better direct-to-home videos. I am glad that I rented this movie for FREE from my library and didn't waste a cent of my money on this. However, I'm sorry that the producers and Mary-Kate and Ashley have made a waste of film. Their movie, Our Lips Are Sealed, is great, and I've seen it about 5 times. It is much more worthy of being viewed than this movie. The movie was almost disconnected in parts and kind of confusing. Maybe because I was getting bored, but I'm not sure....just, don't go see this movie unless you can see it for free and want to waste your time."
1,"Packaging Screwup, bad movie","Although the DVD packaging and DVD itself say ""Widescreen Edition"",the Amazon-purchased DVD is a squished-taller full screen version.As to the content, it's always nice to see the Olsen Twins, but themovie was surprisingly awful, totally wasting the cast of Andy Richter,Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Darrell Hammond with an awful script.I guess that's why the movie bombed at the box office, losing tens of millionsof dollars. If you want to see the best screwball comedy ever made, get the 1972movie ""What's Up, Doc?"" from director Peter Bogdanovich."
1,"Wow, are the people reviewing this film here for real?","This movie is hardly worth your $9 to go see. ""Envy"" with Jack Black is also a dud, but at least it has some genuinely funny moments. But if you look at the reviews below you would think this movie was a killer. Well, folks, according to the just released box office receipts for last weekend, this movie pulled all of $6M and change. Next weekend should see a big drop from these anemic numbers. Can you hear the thud? To call this stinker a 5 star makes me wonder what the person ate before they saw the film because this is just not a very good film. Weak acting, weak script, lack of good humor. My suggestion to the Twins: stick to the direct to video stuff as that crowd may be more forgiving or swallow your egos and take small parts in larger productions so you can learn your craft. For the true fan, better get to the movie theatre quick because this one will be gone faster than a New York minute."
3,"Product Good, But Price and Shipping Not OK","This product is used by my wife and it works well for her, she really likes it. My review is about the price and the time it takes to get it via mail. First of all, I received no Prime Member mailing option for it and had to pay for shipping. Secondly, I ordered multiple items like conditioner and fritz and they all required additional shipping. I received all of them in one package,except one that shipped from different vendor. In truth if you go to CVS or any local pharmacy you can buy them for $5 to $7. I paid about $11 or more and waited a week plus to receive them. This is not a bargain in Amazon. I hope this helps in saving a buck or two."
5,3COM 3c905C card. Solve my problem with a Novell Netware configuration and all the ca,Solve my problem with a Novell Netware configuration and all the cards on the market bring the DOS drivers to be configured. Save my life.
3,"a basic, and quite old, NIC","I got this particular NIC because I needed this specific make and model for device driver testing. The NIC works well, but its only 100 Mbps and probably no less expensive than other good gigabit and newer 100 Mbps units. I wouldn't normally recommend this for new computers. But if you need a 3com NIC, this model works, and is supported by pretty much all of the operating systems."
4,Overpriced,Being a fan of swiss army products and mp3 gadgets I wanted to check this one out. I buy most of my items here at amazon but this one was an exception.I bought this at a shop near my home(in Chicago) for 215$. I dont know why amazon is selling it for 259$ !!! The mp3 player works fine ... fell down a couple of times ...still works fine ... the battery charge retaining time could be better ... jus comes for 7 to 8 hours.The FM Radio option is a kewl option ... goes one up against ipods and other mp3 players ... The multiple file format support feature comes handy.The knife and scissors are of standard swiss army quality but just a couple of them makes one feel handicapped after using the regular swiss army knife.Could be a nice 'techy' gift to someone you like.
1,Insanely overpriced,"1 Gb mp3 players sell for $20-$80 depending on features and quality of construction. The current price for this is over $200. Look elsewhere, this is beyond a ripoff: it's nuts."
2,sacred amulet,"I thought this game had potential, but I was disappointed. Translation was clumsy, animation stiff . As with SO many of dreamcatcher games,controlling the cursor is frustrating.It's so fluid that it's hard to do a simple quarter turn; you wind up doing a 360!! Not many puzzles really, but a lot of running around. You want a great adventure game??? Try LIGHTHOUSE or TIMELAPSE."
2,A nice try...,"The Sacred Amulet is a game that takes place durring the time of one of the greatest empires in world history. However, the gameplay is very poor and there is no true 3d graphics. the graphics engine is comparable to Quick Time VR with 3d panoramic views. This just did not foster good gameplay. Also it was very tedious at times. The included Aztec encyclopedia was a very nice touch. It was not mandatory for game play, but the information is there in case you are interested. It does provide some insight into the culture as you play. The graphics themselves are alright although not 3D. I wouldn't recomend this game to those interested in the action genre or even anyone who engoys RPG games because it simply fails to entertain through its gameplay. However, the graphical content does succeed to allow one to see a small peak into the lives of the Mexica (Aztecs)."
3,an arcane challange,"I consider myself to be well read and to have at least an adequate vocabulary. I seldom need to go to the dictionary for non technical books.This book, however, was a challenge. It is full of obscure Briticisms and classical illusions, many of which I probably missed. It sent me to my kindle dictionary at least every other page. And kudos to the the Kindle's OED, it had all but 2 of these obscure references.The story, too, would seem to require a British sensibility to be as amusing as the author thought it would be. The dysfunctional upper class family and its ancestors did not resonate with me.However, if you are feeling self-confident and secure in you knowledge of English and its uses, secure in your working knowledge of ancient myths of varying cultures, and amused by the absurdities of the British upper classes, give it a whirl, it will re-engender the intellectual humility you may have lost, just be sure you read it on your Kindle so that a dictionary is convenient."
4,"Lotsa of bells and whistles, but easy to use.","This is the first VHS camera I have owned since my old shoulder mounted RCA. Having grown tired of looking like a TV news videographer, I jumped into this new and fortunately much smaller and lighter model.The main thing that attracted me to this camera was the very forthright review by Michael Lynch. He is right on with his comments. I just wanted to add, via this forum, that although the thing can do about anything a sophisticated user might want, you can just put a tape in, turn it on, hit the record button and take some excellent videos. Also, I feel the 26x zoom is worth the extra cost over the 18x zoom of the Panasonic 650L.Oh, and one more thing..andyboy@mozcom.com...if you hated the camera that much...why didn't you just return it?"
2,Digital PhotoShot rots,I just bought a Panasonic Palmcorder model PV-L750. It came with a program 'Digital PhotoShot' but it...well...rots. And there is no other driver on the disc except for the one that goes with that program. I've been looking everywhere for a driver to install the camera in Windows. I already have a great graphics program. All that I need to get to use it with the camera is the driver. I've tried the Panasonic site and emailing them about it.
1,Broke 3 months after warranty was up!,"I finally have a place to discuss my terrible dislike of this camcorder and service from Panasonic. We bought this camera 3 years ago and it never worked right from the start. One of the reasons we bought it was for the built in digital camera. Well my 2 year old son could draw a picture better than the quality it produces. The interface to my computer to upload the camera never worked right and Panasonic was never able to properly troubleshoot the issue. Well my warranty ran out about 3 months ago (had 3 year warranty) and wouldn't you know that it stopped working. Never dropped, hit or nothing and the day of my son's 2nd bday, I went to put tape in and the thing kept humming and spinning the tape but not recording. Not worth having fixed as I heard terrible things about Panasonic customer service, so I am going to buy a new one now!"
3,Complete?,"Great compilation of their first 6 albums remastered for CD. All songs are as excellent and clear sounding as the day they were first recorded. However it's a mistake to label this as the ""Complete"" Captain & Tennille Collection. In addition to the 6 original albums, they've also recorded spanish versions of a couple of their albums ""Love Will Keep Us Together, Make Your Move"" as well as compilations of ""Greatest Hits"" and ""Scrapbook"" and the 1982 australia-only album ""More Than Dancing"" not to mention their two newest Christmas CDs ""Saving Up Christmas"" and ""The Secret of Christmas"" -- None of these were included in this so called ""Complete"" collection. A true C&T collector would like all their albums included, not just their 6 earliest."
1,"You don't have to buy it - you get it in the mail, it's ""manditory""!","Not a review [I wanted to give this no stars, but Amazon doesn't permit that]. Sorry - but this came unsolicited (and unwanted) through my mailbox! It's been recycled. The people behind it have a (shabby) website, but nowhere on it is there a way to prevent them from sending it out to those who are not sufficiently desperate and/or gullible to fall for it. The first page of the website states: ""a manditory directive is coming and will be enforced"" - apparently they can't spell ""mandatory"", so literacy isn't a high priority with them. There have never been ""supernatural powers contending for the supremacy of the world"" - and if anyone else feels a need to believe otherwise, I recommend ""Lord of the Rings"" - it's equally valid, but far more entertaining!"
1,Some d-bag dumped this on my doorstep,"Once I finished laughing, I broke this puppy down into little chunks and tossed it in the compost pile.I do have to wonder where people get the money to toss a ""$14.95"" book on every stoop in the city? I think that's the real controversy here. Such money could go to help feed the homeless or help those down on their luck."
1,The Great Controversy,"As a child, Ellen G. White was severely hurt, even disfigured, when a schoolmate hit her in the face with a large rock. Could this have been the reason for her subsequent ""visions"" (some of us might call these hallucinations)? Just a thought . . . .If you bought and read this book, you've got way too much time on your hands. Frankly, I'd rather peruse my local phone directory than submit to this author's view of the world."
1,bogus reviews,I am willing to bet that most of the wonderful reviews are from the sheep from the Adventist Church. This woman Ellen G White is their so called prophet. She stole other people's writings and called them inspired by God. She told her followers to not eat meat while she was eating oysters. If you want to know the truth look it up. This book is nothing but a novel made to make money.
1,I hate to break the news... but..,"all of this, indeed all of religion throughout history, is nothing more than the ramblings of desperate souls who fear death and as such seek out assurances of an afterlife.Nearly all religions tell one to seek the truth, few have the courage to truly do so."
5,Good read,"im still not finished, but for a book almost a cntury old, its quite intriguing and applicable to the world today. give it a read, you will be amazed."
5,Convenient version,"I enjoy the convenience of having this book within the iPad unit. It is difficult to carry around the books, but in one unit makes it easy."
4,Thought provoking,"I find the book to be an interesting, thought provoking read. If anything it will cause you to dig into the the Word of God, and that's always a good thing for anyone seeking greater clarity in their search for Biblical ""truth"". The book presents a different understanding of ""Daniel and Revelation then what is generally taught in mainstream protestant denominations. Worth the read if you are open to being challenged and you enjoy historical accounts of the early Christian movement and how it evolved into today's various denominations."
1,Did not care for.,The book was just like a text book which I didn't expect. It was not interesting reading as I had hoped it would be.
3,Cross referencing for an unpublished work of mine,"My ""Favorite Uncle"" suggested I read this publication to give me a different view for my own subject matter - forgiveness. I have found the ideas from this writting are supposed to be spiritual revelations of the author. This to me is questionable because the Bible could have been read and this book written in reference. I have started it and it is my way to always finish a book or writting even if it isn't ineresting or to my liking. It seems to be more of a novel but that's just my opinion. Hopefully, the rest will have more substance."
5,The Great Controversy between Christ and Satan,This is what is real and happening through the writings of Ellen White. She gives us a wonderful view of Christ and Satan's fight. Heaven is the praise for us all we need only love God and trust him.
3,Good Movie,"Movie Review: Lahore; Star cast: Introducing Aanaahad, Shraddha Das, Sushant Singh, Mukesh Rishi, Ashish Vidyarthi, Nafisa Ali and Farouque Sheikh; Director: Sanjay Puran Singh Chauhan; Rating: *** 1/2 - An excellent effort.Sometimes you go in for a film with zero expectations and you come out pleasantly surprised, Lahore is one such film. Despite no big stars the film completely works thanks to its direction and acting and excelling in all its technical departments and most importantly for being a very good sports film."
4,Also on Audio Cassette,"This album is also available on audio cassette. See ASN B00000EAIC,Love and Dancing."
3,"Not as beautiful as the book, but quite funny","This is perhaps my favorite book of all time. This version stays fairly close to the book, although much is skipped over for time purposes. The incredible lyricism of the book is almost entirely lost in this rendition, unfortunately. However, Matt Lucas' Toad is, if possible, even funnier than in the book. Side splittingly, tear jerkingly funny. He is a joy to watch. I was disappointed that they completely glossed over my favorite chapter of the book - The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, but that might be hard to do justice in video/film form. Suitable for kids, adults will be disappointed if looking for a dramatic masterpiece. If you haven't read the book - do so. If you've read it to your kids, they will enjoy this video."
5,Timeless Classic,This actor based version of this timeless classic is first rate. Wonderful production and acting.
5,Something for Everyone,"This is a absolutely delightful version of the tales that gains it's strength from not being animated and the incredible performances of all of the real actors, particularly Toad and Badger. The tiniest tot to ancient adults will be enraptured by humans playing animals and the human actors allow the satire of the original stories to shine through. Don't miss it unless you care to wait for the HD version to come out which was even richer when shown originally by PBS in HD."
3,Wind with Too Much Toad,"This is not made for children. Gorgeous scenery. I bought the movie, thinking that since real actors and not kiddish cartooning was featured, that there would be a serious rendition of the book. The constant harping on Mr. Toad's psychotic behavior was entertaining but too much like all other rendtions: too in the face. Two grand chapters were cut from this movie and thus a great deal of the heart of the story are gone. Really left the story askew and slanted. We get to experience Mr. Toad's puffed up personality but not Ratty's yearning to go out into the wide world and we don't experience Mole's deep need for home or the animal's encounter with their own deity. Quite sad that this honorable book is treated so shabbily."
3,They cut the Christmas sequence!,"I found this film entrancing. I agree with those who gave the film 5 stars but was gravely disappointed that PBS edited out the Christmas sequence altogether - ripping out the most emotionally compelling and charming part of the film. Mole watching the human family in the village through the window, Mole longing for his own hole, Rat's compassion when he makes Mole's hole into a warm home, the appearance of the caroling field mice children and the feast that follows. Time restraints or no, by consigning these scenes to the cutting room floor PBS wrenched the heart right out of the film. I am hoping I can find a dvd of the complete film (which I saw recently on cable TV) at a UK sight."
1,Don't waste your money - or your time,"My girlfriend and I watched this on PBS and we both thought it was a dreadful rendition of what I knew was a beautiful story. Since I have known and loved this story since childhood and she didn't, I thought that maybe her comments were adversely affecting my own opinions, so I watched it again, alone. I didn't watch very long! Buy the book instead. I did."
2,Dell Color Laser Printer 5100CN,This printer prints very well on std size paper. But if you want to print any odd-sized cards or envelopes it won't easily work. It will print 2 at a time and then freeze up every time.Dell Gold support people don't know anything about their printers and are of no help. If you can get one at a good price and only want to print on full sheets of paper...it works fine.
3,"""HUSH"" GUSHES, BUT THE OTHERS SMOTHER","Wouldn't it be nice to get along with your sister so well you could actually sing songs with one another? I think it would. But it shall never happen to me because my sisters are too nosey to sing. So, many of us will have to settle for Richard and Karen Carpenter. Nothing could be better."
5,Read this One!,"This is adventure book. If you haven't read ""The Gammage Cup"" then read that one first. If you have read the first book in the series then please take careful note that the main characters of the last book aren't the main one's here. You are introduced to completely new characters but at least the old characters are still in the book. It is filled with excitement and adventure and I guarentee you will love it."
1,His Editor Should Be Hanged,"The book "" CS Tapestry"" often highlights terminology which isn't defined and then uses these terms for explanations in the text. It should have a glossary of terms and definitions and its editor should be hanged. The book should be written for a beginner's point of view. It's marketed as an introduction to the whole field -but gives little attention to the wider tapestry.I spent close to 100 dollars for this book and must invest extra money in supplemental books just to pass the course. He has written a book for beginner computer scientists that can only be understood by computer scientists. This takes no skill at all."
1,Decals??? More like stickers,If your looking for stickers for your young child to add to their school notebook.... these are the ones. Too me these would look really cheap added to a car.
3,Okay - but arrived scuffed,"I intended to use this on a customized computer I am building to sell..., but it arrived with the silver finish skuffed up. It was a waste of money. It would be okay I suppose to put on something else - but not for a project you want to be pristine."
4,Great story,"The story of loving families is wonderful. My kids love it. The print color is odd and the wording is unusual, but after you read it through once its not a problem."
3,"Good Story, Poor Language","My kids loved this book. It was a favorite in our house when our two oldest were two and three years old.The story is simple, but conveys a message of love and caring between parent and child that young children really relate to.Having said that, the story is written in a style that reflects poor pronunciation and word usage (""dat"" for ""that""). I found myself having to substitute correct pronunciation and sentence structure for the actual words. Children at the age to whom the book is targeted may think the story as written reflects correct word usage -- they are very impressionable at two and three!But for the writing style, I would have given it more stars."
3,I hate this book but my daughter loves it.,"I have 20 month old twins and one absolutley loves this book while the other one could care less. The illustrations are what bug me. I know I should judge the book on its outdated artwork, but when you have to stare at it all day long and read it over and over it gets to you! The dad wears flip flops and short shorts. If you're a stickler for proper grammar, you'll hate this book."
1,Terrible,This book was on my pediatricians recommended book list and I though it was terrible. There are many many better books out there.
1,A Terrible Baby Book,"I bought this book from a community yard sale... what a waste of money! Not only are the watercolor illustrations poorly painted, but the proportions are all wrong. The grammar is absolutely terrible, I would not recommend this book if you want your child to speak proper English. Here are two excerpts (capitalization and punctuation as shown in the book):""Little Guy's daddy has to run like anything Just to catch that baby up.""""Then Little Bird's mama brings that baby right up close.""How did this book get five stars? Let alone, a Caldecott Honor Book award? I felt compelled to give a review on this book, even though I didn't buy the book from Amazon, because the book disturbs me so."
1,"Oh, this book is way over-hyped","We bought this book because our toddlers love to say ""MORE!"" and they love to be hugged and chased and tickled ... and also this book got a good review on line. How could we lose? We did! The text is absolutely awful -- almost impossible to read aloud and not at all engaging for kids (or parents)! Our kids adore books, and they barely looked at it. Save your money!"
2,"Why, Why, Why?","This book contains three babies with their caretaker, the father, grandmother, and mother. The children are seen having lots of fun with that person and screaming for more, more, more. Interesting that the second child, an African-American has a Caucasian grandmother. To an adult, they might be able to rationalize this, but to a child this may be very confusing why the parent does not look like the child. The majority of children reading this book is used to seeing children with relatives that look like them. If the author wants to make a statement of interracial relatives, why wasn't this done with child one and three?"
5,Poetry in Motion,"I was so surprised to see poor reviews for this book based on grammar. I LOVE this book. I was an English major. When I read this to my daughter it flows like poetry, and the illustrations leap off the page. It doesn't sound like every other sing song book. I like sing song books too, but this book's flow and pictures made me cry.My daughter is almost 2 and I came here to order another copy because some pages have torn from overuse. My daugther is mesmerized by the pictures, and relates to Little Bird at the end who is asleep because we read it at bedtime. I agree it's outside the box, but that's what I loved about it. Why shouldn't children be exposed to a variety of narrative styles just like adults? Please don't tell me she's going to learn poor grammar...anymore than she's going to think bunnies really sleep in beds like in Good Night Moon. Where did all the creativity and imagination go?"
2,"unexciting, dispite the acclaim","It did not capture my sons' interest at any age, though I do understand that with the simple repetitive words it should have."
3,Cute book,"This book is ok, great repeating book for the ""more, more, more"" word, but not a great story."
1,Caldecott Honoree?,I can't understand why this book was named as a Caldecott Honor book. Really nothing about the book impressed me. Maybe I am too much of a traditionalist but the illustrations were mediocre. The stories were too repetitive and used bad grammar. It did not appeal to me on any level. Please inform me if I missed something.
1,Horrible!,"I hate this book. The wording is poor, the story is boring, the characters are outdated and my daughter cannot sit through one read through of it."
3,fuzzy pictures,"pictures and words are too fussy and hard to distinguish, but I like the content though."
4,She loves it!,"Well, quite frankly it is a sweet and simple story-a bit too simple for my taste! However, my daughter(23 months) loves it and has requested it every night for two weeks(groan!)"
2,Oh Caldecott.....You Keep Letting Me Down,"I seem to have purchased many, many Caldecott books believing that the award alone warranted adding it to my daughter's book collection only to be sorely disappointed. This book is another example. It is three short and related stories in one. The ways that the adults interact with the children is a little creepy in parts and the story is so long for being so incredibly drab. Moreover, the grammar in incomprehensible as each adult ""catches that baby up"" and any pattern to the language breaks down within a page or two. The As you can see from other reviews, it can be a bit painful for a parent to read through. My own toddler is not that interested in it but occasionally pulls it out to ask for it resulting in a huge internal ""Yuck"" from me. I am grateful I bought it used for $0.99."
1,Disappointed with bad grammar!,"The book is nice and colourful but I was really quite disappointed with the grammar! Phrases such as ""daddy had to run like anything"" ""to catch the baby up"" I think are really badly constructed. It appears 3x in the book! I won't be reading this to my baby/toddler, I don't want him to pick up any bad language habits."
2,My kids weren't thrilled.,"My kids didn't like this book much. I didn't like that the text was printed in colored ink. It blended in too much with the artwork. Hard to see. Also the content was just blah. Too simple for older kids, and too many words for the little ones to wait for. Not one of our favorites."
3,"Excellent concept, but baby finds it boring.","I was all set to love this book. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was not shared by my 11 month old. I also bought this book for a friend, whose child seems similarly unimpressed. If I had to guess, I'd say the kids find the pictures a bit dull and the stories too repetitive."
1,Hard to read and very annoying.,"This book was just awful. The text is very poorly written so that it's impossible to read fluidly. The pictures are annoying and the page layout is irritating. My daughter, who would happily allow me to read to her for hours, zoned out during this book. Ugh!"
3,My Beat Crazy review,"After releasing two excellent albums the previousyear Joe Jackson released 'Beat Crazy' in 1980; althoughthis album doesn't even come close to being theclassic that ""Look sharp!"" and ""I'm the man"" became thereare some good tracks like 'Someone up there', 'Biology','One to one' and, of course, the title trackIf you do get this album I highly recommend theremastered version."
3,Not the best for this group,"The third album by Joe Jackson with his original band, it just doesn't match up to its predecessors, Look Sharp and I'm the Man. There's some good stuff here, but Joe seems to be trying to get away from the new wave guitar sound of the first 2 albums, but hasn't yet reached what would be his complete departure on Night and Day. Too many songs are neither here nor there."
4,Some great songs and some other ones too,"After the great ""Look Sharp"" and the even greater ""I'm the Man"", Joe Jackson released ""Beat Crazy as this 3rd LP. The effort was credited to the Joe Jackson Band and not just Joe and it was a change in direction. There's a reggae influence here and the title track and leadoff track signals the new direction with bass player Graham Maby singing lead.There are some really great JJ songs here including the title track, ""One to One"". ""Someone Up There"" ""Biology"" and ""Fit"". There's 5 other cuts here also and they are not up those high standards. Of course, the changes in direction continue to this day. This is not as consistently wonderful as his 2 first LP's but there are some essential JJ tracks here."
2,Good...but there's no cue to turn the page!,"I expect a lot out of anything with a Disney association, and in many ways this does not disappoint. However, I believe it has a fatal flaw that makes it less child-friendly. I love to read with my children, but I view these read-alongs as a good alternative so our young children (3 & 5) can ""read"" a book on their own. However, none of these stories include cues to let a child know when to turn the page! This leaves them guessing and was a severe disappointment for all of us."
3,Needs more variety of voices,"While my kids enjoy listening to the stories that they know so well, they get bored easily since with the voice never changing. They don't use the various character voices in telling the story as they do in other disney CDs that we have. The songs and poems that are on the CD sound silly even to my kids who always ask me to skip those--they should have used a song from the movie if they wanted to include music on the CD. I'd recommend the Disney read-along CDs over this as those use character voices and are more interesting/dramatic to listen to."
1,Beware NO AUDIO CD!!,Very disappointed that there was no audio CD! This should have been listed as just a book!!! Great if your looking for just the book.
3,Where was the cd?!,This product was used but rated very good. It delivered as far as the book was concerned but with a product description of very good I expect the Cd to be included with the Cd storybook as advertised.
5,Kids love it!,"We use books on CD for ""Rest Listening"" in preschool. Listening to stories is essential to literacy and the kids love it!"
3,Missing Chimes,"I love the read along books for my pre-reader, but this one doesn't have the chimes telling her to turn the page. She needs help every couple of minutes finding what page the recording is on."
4,Meets expectations...,"After watching the show on MTV, I was looking forward to hearing the completed sounds of Danity Kane. This CD certainly shows off their unique talents; however, it does not encompass everyones voices. It seems as though Shannon is in the background most of the time. Overall, this CD is a great start for this group and I would most likely purchase their next release!"
2,Only okay,"I liked one song, and that one was only okay. After seeing them on TV, I saw so much potential and their CD was highly anticipated on my side. I was so very dissapointed. Boo."
2,Solid...Showstoppin their way to 15 minutes,"Not bad it will do i guess better than the horrible paris album that came out today but i think I'll be spending my cash on Outkast....but what idiot said this was the ""best album ever made"" you gotta be kiddin yourself they have a good buzz now and probably another season but they will slowly disappear into forgotten bad boy artist land like everybody who comes out of the Diddy camp"
1,Puffy's Broke version of the pussyCat Dolls,"Danity Kane the latest Reality Tv Group that Puffy is spring on us again. same formula. all image&little Vocal substance. Production fits the Lite vocals. not alot on the songwriting department either. but Puffy can Sell Fast-food with the best of them. He has never fully gotten the Girl Group act done Properly. but he has been able to Sell Cassie&now he has a Group of them. catchy name,can't say the same about the Vocals&the Music though."
1,Don' t waste your time,This cd is not good at all folks. Do not waste your time with this mess. Same old junk time after time.
1,terrible,"I don't like this group at all. I heard their new song ""Show Stopping."" That song is terrible!!!!!!! I feel like these can't sing. The video is stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't like Danity Kane. What in the world does Danity Kane mean anyway????? I don't like them, or their songs. They need to go away!!!"
4,Wow!,"I've been waiting for this cd since the 2nd season of MTB 3 started! I wasn't disappointed. I went to a store and bought this cd at 3:45 A.M. I think that this cd has numerous awesome tracks but my favorite would have to be ""Ride with you"""
5,Best CD I have bought in a long time,I love this CD. Usually I buy a cd end up only like 4 songs or so on it but i absolutely love every single song on this CD. Definitely worth the money! Very good album!
1,I hate this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Girls are pretty, but this release feels super empty.The lyrics are bland, and the production is all over the place!How any sane person (especially males) could get into this crap, is beyond me.I was actually rooting for them on the show though; they seemed to get closer as girl after girl left the group. I wanted the Pisces, Dominique to make it so, so bad because although she was no dancer, she had one of the best voices on the show!Anyway, glad Aubrey made it; she was the prettiest, had a nice, like-able and friendly demeanor and she could sing decently.I guess Show Stopper is solid. No substance, no depth but it's fun and it's catchy. I give them points for this one.The rest is **** though.Don't buy this.Here's some advice. When you go shopping, and you come to the music section, don't even look at this damn thing!! It's phony, generic and quite soulless.1 star. Wish I could give it less..."
1,Almost Tolerable but do you really want to listen to that?,"I will be the first to say that these girls have some talent- they can harmonize definitely. Okay, so what? That does not negate the fact that the songs are formulaic and the entire CD lacks heart- something that cannot possibly be found from such contrived set-ups as this. Also, has anyone even listened to the lyrics? ""Showstopper"" is a female version of the standard male-rap song of today- while it definitely is not meant to be taken seriously, the lyrics are downright laughable (or sad) depending on your take"" ""jiggle them keys"", ""to all my ladies in the rainbow mercedes""....if I had the talent those girls do I would be ashamed to be singing those lines. But then of course, if everyone makes money credibility as an artist doesn't mean much, does it? To summarize: the harmonies are decent but if you actually listen to the words or look for any real emotion the CD becomes painful."
2,once again the quality of music drops!!,"Being one of the many drawn to these girls for the one and only reason of them being on a T.V. show, I am absolutely positive that I wouldn't have evened listened to the album if it weren't for mtb3. But the quality of the album doesn't surprise me at all because they never could sing on the show. I feel bad for all of the wonderful producers and the great beats they have given these girls only for them to put their less than mediocre voices over them. Showstopper is the best thing on here. I was kinda hoping that since they sounded so terrible on the show that maybe all the high tech studio equipment could work some magic on their voices by the time the CD came out but I guess not.I have no doubt that these girls will be successful because you don't need talent to be successful in the music business today. So I hope their dancing stays on point because their singing is so bad. They better ride the beauty equals success train until its wheels fall off!!!"
1,I was very suprised....,"I watched this show and the clips of the songs that they played seemed very good, however, all of the songs pretty much feature Dawn, the one with the deep voice. The other girls have such great voices I felt that they were backup. I was not impressed at all."
2,Family members stop reviewing this CD,"This CD is the worst.... the only song that I like is the shortest one #10... that should have been the lead singer whoever it is... It must be Dee she is the best singer even though Puffy said she was fat... she is the Prettiest & the best..Save your money this CD is my newest Cup Holder!!! 2 stars, for effort!!!"
5,EXCELLENT ALBUM!,"It's a very good album. I prefer the slow songs over the fast ones with the exception of ""sleep on It"" a.k.a the ""untitled"" track. I just hope diddy invest time into them unlike he has done majority of his artist."
5,Awesome!!,I thought this album was awesome!! I like the entire album and just listen to it on repeat. They worked with some really good producers and it's great that they can actually sing.
5,Surprisingly good!,"I only bought this cd after listening to it for free on MTV's ""The Leak"" a while back. I was very surprised and somehow really drawn to it. I mainly like dance music anyways and this is a great dance cd! I was surprised however that more videos weren't made for this album. There are about 5 'Top 10' hits on this record but oh well! For a first album by a bunch of rookies I give it 5 stars. I guess being formed by Puff, who has a ton of connections, made the world of difference! Great album, can listen to it the whole way through... something a lot of albums don't have anymore! Looking forward to the next installment :)"
5,Very Happy Customer,"I was very happy with my order, It was delivered in a timely manner and condition of my order was in great shape. Look foward to doing future business with you."
3,Not bad at all,"I enjoyed the songs, show stopper and ooh ahh. But really all of them were not bad. The girls sound good and are in harmony. Could do past one or two of them, but for the most part... I liked it."
3,One shot? May need another one........,"I don't think there is anything new I can say from what others have already observed, but I felt like putting in my two cents! :-) The CD isn't complete garbage, but it could have been a LOT better, especially considering the kind of high profile sponsors and producers the group had at their disposal. You probably won't catch me at a Danity Kane concert, and if they make a second album, I'll only pay $10 (or less) for it just like I did this one. LOL.But they are doing their thing and following their dreams and no one can be mad at them for that."
3,"Liked the show, but....","I admit that I did like MTB3. It was entertaining and showed the hard work that the girls put in to be chosen and then to perform. ""Ride With You"" is a good ballad. I'm not real crazy about ""Show Stopper"" for some reason; the vocals are too breathy, and I just can't get into it. My favorite is ""Hold you down"", good beat and stronger vocals. While I like this group and think they are all talented (especially more so that the Pussycat Dolls), I think Aundrea is by far the best singer in the group and would have a good shot as a solo artist. The album is okay, but I expected to like more of the songs and that didn't happen, but it's worth a listen."
5,Excellent debut!! Definately worth the wait!,I first heard Danity Kane's songs on the show Making the Band 3. I watched the show religiously for the two seasons that these extremely talented girls have been there. I really liked the samples of the songs I heard so when I bought the album I was absolutely not disappointed. I love that it is so upbeat and fun(although there are a couple of slower songs). I constantly find myself dancing and rocking my head with the beat of these tracks(People in the cars next to me on the highway must think i'm insane)! I can honestly say that I really like every single song on this album A LOT! Diddy has really found magic in these 5 women. Their voices are absolutely beautiful and the mixture of them is entrancing! I can't wait to see what they create next!
5,Surprisingly Great!!!,"Puffy actually picked a good one this time. Their voices go very well together it is an all around good CD, definitely worth the money you'll love it."
3,Quit Diddy,This CD is not one of my favorites. There are only 2 songs I really listen to. I think Diddy has lost it...
2,Disappointment,The two stars i gave this album was only because I like the song Show Stopper so much. I thought the rest of the album would be similar. It is like a sad drawn out drama. It is horrible would not reccommend to anyone. Get the single

1,TERRIBLE-SOUNDING DISC; OPT FOR THE UK '98 IMPORT,"The audio on this disc obviously comes from the old LP-EQ'd master. It sounds AWFUL.If you are looking to pick up this album, get the 1998 remastered U.K. CD, which is night-and-day better than this edition.Also, the import has two additional bonus tracks that do not appear on the U.S. CD.The import is now OOP, and is more expensive, but it's worth it.Just be careful to confirm that this edition isn't mis-listed under the higher-priced import. The correct catalog number for the import is 540 807-2. You would be wise to e-mail the seller and confirm that before you buy.Link to the 1998 remaster ofSweets From A Stranger."
3,NOT as advertised,"The advertisement said this would work for my battery, and when it finally got here, it wouldn't even fit my battery. This was the hardest return I've dealt with so far, but Amazon took care of it. Thank You Amazon"
4,"Good price and unit, if your battery fits",Read the description and only purchase this unit if your battery part number is listed.
1,Do not buy the combo pack!,"I needed a both new battery pack and a charger, so I ordered the 12-volt battery shown as a combo-pack with the multi-volt charger. The batteries came from a different supplier than the charger and THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE! THE 12-VOLT BATTERY WILL NOT EVEN GO INTO THE CHARGER! Why the heck does Amazon offer a combo pack of two products that won't work together??"
4,"Works great, but my battery apparently died. :(","Well, it let me know my battery for my power drill has died! Which means now I need to purchase a new batter to.The charger is great, just can't say ""I love it"" since all it did was inform me my battery is deceased. :( Costs a fortune for a new battery. *sigh*"
1,Check your battery model!,"This charger will not work on my Ryobi batteries because the plug-in connection is different. I don't know why Ryobi does this, but you better get your battery model number and check it against the detailed charger description before buying."
4,Lowepro Z 10 Pouch (Black),Where else can you find a camera casefor $10.00. Nice case at a great price
4,A balanced look at the Prince's work and life,"Despite the pre-release promise of a flame job on Diana, little is reported here that has not been previously published in one place or another---most specifically the works of Lady Colin Campbell. If the reader is really interested in Prince Charles work with the Prince's Trust and other organizations the book provides an excellant overview of his goals for charitable work and the tasks he performs."
3,THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLES AT LAST!,"I always suspected that Charles wasn't cold and Diana might have been somewhat selfish, why would she prance around the place putting herself at risk and under scrutiny when she had two children to think about? Anyway, this book really put things into perspective and seems to back other books up that are supposed to condemn Charles and worship Diana! The book itself however, was a little boring, it went on too much about their relationship and did seem to victimise Diana a little."
4,Definitely A Page Turner !,"This book is very interesting! The author is obviously a GREAT fan of Prince Charles! From interviews that I have seen with the author, I fully expected a Diana-bashing book and I wasn't far from the mark! Just the mere fact that the Princess of Wales is not here to defend herself against these so-called ""facts"" of Ms. Junor's shows you what kind of diabolical mind the author has! Ms. Junor herself is making quite alot of money writing about the misfortunes of the Prince & Princess of Wales. I should hope that the proceeds for this book would go directly to royal charities and those who are TRUE victims all around the world! Surely Ms. Junor would not want to line her own pockets with this scathing book - or would she? Think on, Ms. Junor!"
1,Biased and sexist view of the Royal family,"Penny Junor feels the need to apologize for Charles and defend the coldness exhibited by the Royal family. To do this, she seems to find it necessary to downgrade Diana. Personally, I like Charles. He seems abundantly human, a good father, and how many people could wake up their children and have to break their hearts? He did an impossible job very well. However, on page 51, Junor writes ""Apart from the companionship,... Charles had no need for a wife. His life was ordered, his meals were cooked, his clothes bought, laundered and laid out for him; his every whim catered for..."". Is this what Junor thinks a wife does? If so, it's no wonder the marriage failed. There are far better books in this genre."
3,Charles: Victim and Villain,"This book is very pro-Charles which was to be expected. After all, both author and Charles are still alive. Diana can't fight back. And who knows what the truth is anyway?There isn't anything really new in this book except details about how news of Diana's death was received at Balmoral, actions of Charles and the Queen then, etc. There are conflicts with other accounts I've read. Was Diana's face damaged? Was an autopsy done in Paris? Other sources said her face was unmarked and body was not autopsied until it was returned to London. It is little details like this that make me wonder about rest of the book. What is the truth?I continue to be amazed at the influence the press has in England. Do they really have that much control over the Royal Family? Apparently they just make stuff up and everyone believes it. The Royals are so out of touch and isolated. I think they should just be left alone and out of the newspapers like they used to be."
2,"Interesting, but the sloppy errors make it less credible.","It's interesting. She says both were victims, by the way, with faults and good points. The trouble is, sloppy errors like wrong dates and quotes, and calling Pierre Trudeau Canada's President, make it hard to trust other information. There are no source notes. For instance, where did she get the information about their sex life together? In addition, the syntax is dreadful, even allowing for British/American variations. Finally, some terms are meaningless to me, though I presume a Briton would understand them."
2,Revisionist history,Penny Junor's new book on Charles is a great work of revisionist history aimed at putting Charles into a better light and also dear Camilla. The truth of the marriage is somewhere in-between Andrew Morton and this book which neatly refutes every one of the common stories of the marriage. Charles can't be that good and Diana couldn't have been that bad. Will Junor become a Dame of the Empire for this???
4,Bought book for a friend (college student),"I only skimmed the book, but I am dissappointed that the 9th edition didn't have more info on immigration issues post 2001. Immigration for those that come here on H1 visas, J1 visas, etc. and then remain legally.If it were not for the prof. requiring 9th edition an earlier edition would suffice (at a lower used price too.) Oh well. It's an OK book."
3,good starting point,"This book is a good foundation for understanding diversity in the United States, but is limited in scope. Strong points are some of the research that was done and presented in the book. Weaker points are that it is already a bit dated. Seems the world is changing faster than this book's authors even anticipated."
4,This book is now out of print.,This is out of print. Don't buy it unless you have to and know that you can't sell it back.
5,great satisfaction on my purchase,I was impressed with my recent purchase of strangers to the shores: Race and Ethnic Relations in United States. The item was delivered earlier than stated and the item was in the condition (new)as the seller indicated.
5,Awesome case,This case is awesome. It's very well padded to protect my husband's camera and has plenty of pockets for all of his accessories.
5,KIng of Action!,"I lost interest with action films until all the ""Bourne"" movies came out! I love all of them and will never get sick of them! AWESOME MOVIES! MATT DAMON IS THE LATEST KING OF ACTION!"
3,Lacking in Specifics,"This piece is an excellent essay on the origin and history of locks and keys; however, I was disappointed in its lack of detail. I was looking for something more focused on the differences between lock evolution in various countries. At best it is a superficial review of lock history."
3,Fun to watch but...,"I like this DVD collection. My only disappointment is that the songs are missing. I knew something was strange when the songs get cut out. For example, there was one episode where Mario sings rolling on the river. That's missing, as well as some other songs that they sing in the episodes. Copyright issues? Perhaps. It would have been better if they spend extra money to get the songs intact."
5,Very Good,This was one of the best DVD sets I bought. Dvd would nice and sayed inthe box. My son loved this show when he was a kid and I bought it and Vol 2 for him.
4,Super Show,This DVD is great except for one small problem. It is not the complete Super Show. It is about half of the entire series including animated shows and live-action segments. The episode quality is excellent and the shows bring back memories to those of us who watched them when they originally aired back in the 1980's.
5,Finally!,"It's so good to finally see cartoons that are actually funny and clever back on the tv screen.This show came out when I was only six, and I fondly remember sitting in front of the tv, waiting for it to start every afternoon. Having all of these cartoons collected with the live action scenes on a dvd set like this is a true joy.The behind the scenes segments are a real treat, as is the interview with Captain Lou Albano. Also, anyone who is an art fan will enjoy the concept art gallery that's included on each disc.Overall, if you're a parent looking for good cartoons that won't rot your kids brains, or just someone looking to recapture your youth, give this dvd a try!"
1,Super Mario Bros Super Show disaster,2 of the DVD's in the collection were badly scratched and not usable. This product should not have even been put up for sale.
2,..,The coverart to this DVD set looks horrible.Does anyone know if the Super Mario Bros 3 cartoon will be out? I liked that one much better than the Super Show.
1,Bait and switch?,"My grandkids started watching this series a couple of months ago. It was free with Amazon prime. They went to continue watching, where they left off and lo and behold, it's 1.99 an episode. What's up with that, Amazon? You get kids interested in something and then cash in on it? Very disappointed in you guys. This is the first negative review that I have ever posted about Amazon itself. Hopefully it'll be the last."
4,Great memories,"This is a must buy for anyone born in the mid 80's or just plain fans of the video games. Super Mario bros. goes way back. I love this show. The cartoons are reason enough to buy them. Although at some points the cartoon ""glitches"" a bit, with problems like mad discoloration, and wrong voice dubbs. It's actually outstanding how they messed up some things. The real-life show portion of the show is extremely cheesy but entertaining. The entire show itself is overall enjoyable. It certainly brings back alot of memories!"
4,Live action segments and missing music,"For the most part, the episodes are the way they originally aired - with the live-action MARIO BROS. episodes sandwiching the cartoons, as well as the commercial intros/outros.Unfortunately, the cartoons are the 1990's edited versions.All of the songs originally in the episodes (""Bad"", ""Magic Carpet Ride"", etc) were replaced by the instrumental portions of songs from ""The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"" and ""Super Mario World"".I hope that at some point they rerelease this set with the original music, even if they have to pay royalties. I also hope that they leave the original music in ""The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"" in place when they release that series."
3,Not bad,"Not bad. A little inacurrate here and there. For example, the Interurban never crossed the Ottawa Aquaduct. That is something that has been handed down. The Interurban railroad always crossed the Main St. bridge on its way to Marseilles. You will never see a picture of one crossing the aqueduct, but you can see them crossing the Main street - Fox River Bridge.Also for the local fans, Lock 9, 10, 11, and 12 are ignored in this video."
3,Blessings & promises through the eyes of women of the Bible,"I gave this book to female high schol and college graduates and have recieved feedback from 3 of the recipients, all positive. Ann Spangler has a good reputation and one girl was excited about the book after just seeing who the authjor is."
1,Shoddy Tubes.,"I ordered two of these tubes to refit my road bike with. Prior to mounting onto the rim, I inflated both of them to 20 PSI. I instantaneously noticed three bulges on both tubes. Two were located next to the valve stem and one located about a quarter of a turn away from the valve stem. I installed the tubes anyway, inflated them to 60 PSI, and then put my road bike back onto the bike rack of my car. This bike rack keeps the bike off of the ground, ergo, no pressure on the tires. The next morning when I walked by my car I noticed that the rear tire of the bike was deflated. After removing the tire and tube, the tube had a 3 inch long tear right next to the valve stem where two of the bulges were located.I can only imagine how un-safe these tubes are in actual riding conditions considering the fact that they burst with no load on them and having never been ridden. I would certainly steer clear of these and choose another brand before trusting yourself on something such as these."
4,So far so good,"I have an old school schwinn free spirit bike and needed replacement tubes. I bike about an hour daily in busy Manhattan streets filled with bumps and potholes and so far these tubes have done the job. I need to pump the tires about every other week, but for a month of biking without having a flat that's a small price to pay."
2,Sunlite tire tube,Bought these tubes to replace some older tubes when I replaced the tires on my bike. Tubes seemed flimsy. When I inflated the tires the tube on one tire imediately popped like a cheap balloon. Poor quality.
1,stem does not fit,No where does it list that the stem will not fit through the hole in my wheel nor would it fit through the diameter of my wife's bike wheel if I wanted to keep the tubes. I will have to send the tubes back.
2,Don't Hold Air,"I read the reviews of this product and wasn't sure. I ordered anyway because it seems difficult to find tubes that receive consistently good reviews. I installed this tube without any problems, and I suppose it's working. However, it's been a couple of months, and I have to give this tube an extraordinary about of inflation prior to each ride. The tubes that came with my bicycle did not require nearly this much inflation, and I had those for many years. I suggest looking elsewhere."
4,Holds air,"First, I ordered 2 of these from the seller, both with shrader valves, but the delivery came with one schrader and one presta which requires a completely different air pump fitting. I tried contacting the seller, but I could not find the contact info on Amazon. I did a search and called a phone number that was listed for the company. The guy who answered was nice but angry since he said that they get lots of calls with complaints about the company due to the fact that someone is using their name and they can't seem to do anything about it. Obviously they were not able to help. So I thought about returning the item but with the fees and time involved I, instead , bought a new pump. I have put the two tubes on my Schwinn and so far the tubes are holding air. That's its' job. So as far as I can tell, it is doing its' job. But I was disappointed in the mistaken order."
4,Why not?,"Work great, can't complain about pricing either. unfortunately 200 miles in, mine popped. Shipping as well as satisfaction was guaranteed. I couldn't be happier. Now to order some new ones!"
2,yosemite bicycles--5 Stars great company,yosemite bicycles sold the Sunlite bicycle tube 27 x 1-1/8 to me. It arrived with a manufacture defect. I purchased in fall and did not open till the next summer. It was way past warranty. Yosemite bicycle sent me a replacement with no hassle. Great company. Would do business in future with no problem. Thanks for great service.
3,Left Field Ending,"Not bad. Was actually closer to a 4 star until the end. The ending sort of came out of left field, and what had been a good book turned into a so-so book. All in all, fairly mediocre.."
1,Unbelievably dreadful!,"I am baffled by the 5 star reviews of this book. I tried to finish it but could not. The author over describes and over analyses absolutely everything. It is written in the first person, present tense and is really annoying. There is more padding in this novel than in an arm chair. The author gives his ridiculous thoughts over and over. I found myself screaming out aloud 'just get on with it, for pity's sake!' There is a gas chamber execution scene at the start of the book - if only the lawyer had been in the chamber, instead of as a witness, we would all be a lot happier. I will never read, or attempt to read, another offering from Mr Martini."
4,Don't miss this one,"This was my first Steve Martini book. The book is about Paul Madriani, a divorced criminal trial lawyer, who had an affair with Talia, his boss' wife, and was eventually let go from the firm. He is on his own when Ben, his former boss, is brutally murdered and Talia is accused of the crime. He defends her in court.The storyline behind this courtroom thriller is absolutely fantastic. It took about 100 pages for the book to get really interesting, but once the story took off, I couldn't let go of the book. I can't wait to read one of his other books and I hope you enjoy 'Compelling Evidence' as much as I did."
3,Mixed feelings,"I enjoyed Martini's writing style very much. He really adds a lot of detail and creates vivid images. But, for some reason, the book didn't grab me and pull me in. It took me nearly three weeks to finish the book (which is a long time for me-usually I'm able to finish a good book within a day or two). From the start, you know that the prime suspect (Talia) didn't commit the crime-so you want to figure out 'who done it'. It takes a long time to get to that point. Way too long, actually. However, once you do find out who the killer is, you are full of shock. The ending is by far the best part of the book-and that part is ended much too quickly. For those of you who like court room dramas, this is probably a great choice. If you're looking for something full of mystery and suspense, I wouldn't recommend this book. The ending is really the only part that makes you stop and say, ""Oh my God-really?"" Other than that, it's just a long book."
2,Audiobook review,"I was never a fan of Steve Martini, and, unfortunately or not, I will not be one after having listened to this audio adaptation. Now, sometimes bad audio versions of book can be due to the ineptness of the reader. But Joe Mantegna&#65533;s reading was full of energy and nuance, what there was available. I believe the problem lies within the source material. Martini has committed the cardinal sin of courtroom thrillers--he&#65533;s made them boring."
1,I'm sorry but the book was horrible. I couldn't get into it,It was horrible. One of the worst books ever. Thank youBelly Up
1,So much dialogues,"If you like descriptions, run away from this book. They just talk, and talk, and it's so boring. Make a play with this, and perhaps the characters act in the audience."
2,a soap opera of poor people,"Ms. Welty has written, seemily, a book of her people, but I just could not read it. The Renfro clan was having a reunion on the day Jack Renfro was to arrive home from prison. It was also Granny's birthday. The best part of the story I read was of Jack's indiscretion tha led him to be incarcerated. I just could see this story going around and around, making mistakes of judgement and choices that run counter to the gerenal law of the land. It reminded me of ""Tobacco Road."" It has a simalar hapless band of amilies that can not rise above the sorry state of life they are living. It is like a soap opera of poor people and it just does not strike me as interesting."
2,Most boring book EVER,Our entire book club tried and tried - and we have all types of readers..........no one could get thru it. Too much like a play and surely not enough PLOT..we all finished it by duty.....I hear her short stories are much better.
5,A fascinating collection by a great American author.,"One of Miller's earliest books,and considered to be thesecond in the Tropics trilogy, this is a collection ofshort sketches (for lack of a better term) by a young HenryMiller using the mature writer's voice that makes him sucha powerful speaker. With pieces like ""The Angel is MyWatermark"", a hilarious self-portrait of Miller in Parissuffering an excess of artistic inspiration, to a tenderreminiscence of his father's New York tailor shop, thisbook contains a side to Henry Miller rarely seen throughthe publicity but known to his careful readers; a sidethat is philosophical, spiritual, and funny. It remainsone of Miller's best and most enduring books."
5,Black Spring -- my first Henry Miller novel,"I just finished reading BLACK SPRING. It blew me away. Henry Miller's storytelling style is so personal, it's kind of like taking an unexpected medium punch in the gut. The geography becomes local, the imagery is rough, obscene and poetic, and goes on for pages at a time. Miller becomes larger than life, powerful through his honesty and vulnerability. I am amazed with his unique ability to effortlessly paint such vivid pictures, wander aimlessly through haunting nightmares, and relive pleasure and passion. From sitting around in the Parisian home of friend Jabberewohl Crondstadt celebrating each other's conquests and madness, to wandering the dark bum-piss hooker-lined streets of forbidden America, I found myself constantly stopping, re-reading and wondering how he took me there. Eventually I stopped raising my hand to ask questions, and just sat back and listened."
2,Henry Miller - Black Spring,"I thought ""Black Spring"" was typically repulsive to read. I have only enjoyed reading ""Hieronymus Bosch and the Oranges of Big Sur""."
3,Disappointing Read,"As a big fan of Anais Nin's diaries I was drawn to this by her descriptions of being with Henry Miller while he was writing Black Spring. She is a much better writer than he is. What you have with Miller is a horny crank with a terrific prose style. Sometimes the writing in this book rises to heights that are stupendous. The story Jabberwhorl Cronstadt is one. I haven't finished the book yet, as it's slow going when it's not terrific, which, so far, is most of it.Sorry to be so critical of a man who is an idol of many, but, having read Tropic of Cancer and as much of this as I've plowed through I just can't see it."
4,The Bride Wore Blood is a top-notch microcinema film! Check it out!,"Bluebox's modern day Western called The Bride Wore Blood, co-written and co-directed by founders Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, follows the exploits of a modern day hired-gun-with-a-conscience, played effectively by Travis Shepherd. Shepherd is hired to protect a man's soon-to-be bride when things go horribly wrong. Drawn to follow the facts of her death to its ultimate conclusion, Shepherd finds a weaving story of deceit and mistrust make up the driving forces behind his failure to protect the bride.The film clocks in at 60 minutes and is segmented into four ""acts"" which twist the story from one unexpected path to the next. All of the cinematic elements are top notch, from the music to the cinematography, to the acting to the directing. The writing is crisp and the camera movements create a wonderful, consistent style of the piece.This is excellent microcinema film making from two very talented guys."
2,Too promotional,"While I agree there are some very good articles, I find this magazine to be way too promotional with most of the promotions pointing to RAND products and classes. The overpromoting overshadows the articles. Not worth the money to me."
5,Love it.,Every issue covers a very wide variety of topics related to reiki. I learn something new each time I read it.
5,Reiki Mastership,"I have not read yet, trying to subscribe. I will be completing my mastership next Tuesday, February 11th, 2003, with Carla Priest, Reiki Master/Teacher of Harwich, Ma. on Cape Cod"
3,Fine if you're a book collector . . . . .,"However, the technical information is available in a revised format as the AISC Design Guide 15. Available as a .pdf download or paperback on the AISC website for as low as $60. Note: I have never seen this item. My opinion is based on it's value as a technical resource."
4,A Marshall Plan-sized amount of information,"It's amazing how much information Osprey can stuff into a slim, 95-page volume, and The Marshall Islands 1944 is a strong addition to its canon.Pros:- The illustrations are great, with the 3D-maps especially well-done.- Gordon Rottman's prose is concise and cogently-written(a small) Con:- There's so much information here it may be overwhelming to some readers.But overall this is a very well-done, comprehensive account of the campaign. Bravo, Rottman and Osprey!"
5,A book well worth the money,"I found ""Wizzil"" at the local library and thought it would be just another picture book to share with my children. As I started reading it, I was instantly hooked on the writing style of author William Steig. This book is ""awesome"" and ""highly entertaining."" I am also a children's writer myself trying to break into the business, so I have read and studied many children's picture books--this one by far stands out as being one of the best written. The imagination of William Steig is very comical as well as highly entertaining. His writing style is one of the best. You can't help but love his characters and sink into the story. I am going to purchase my own copy of this book--this is one story my kids will want to hear over and over. It is a purchase well worth the price. I was amazed to find out he also wrote ""Shrek."" What a talented writer!"
3,It's an ok CD.,"I bought this CD because it had ""Hello I Love You"", one of Crystal's greatest songs but not on any of her so-called ""greatest hits"" CDs. ""Somebody Loves You"" also makes this CD worthwhile, but the other songs are just ok."
2,Shipping Cost Too High,"I could not believe it when I found out that none of the standard consumer electronics stores had the mini jumpers available locally. So I had to order them online. I come to find out they are hard to purchase online as well.The product that was shipped to me is fine, but the shipping charges were outrageous."
2,I'm sticking with Reed & Barton,"Sorry to say the flatware arrived, and I was highly unsatisfied. The set felt cheap and the back of the stainless was concave. I've had Reed & Barton for years, and you guessed it, I returned this set and got something more expensive from R&B. Sorry Henckels, but you cannot make flatware. But I still love your knife sets."
2,"Relaxing, but far to many songs!","With this CD I find that each song is very different and its only by the end of the CD I might fall asleep. It is very good for relaxation but not the best for trying to fall asleep. So my next CD was a winner! Music for Deep Sleep, Thunderstorm, Rain and Ocean Waves has one or two very long songs. Healing Sounds of Nature gets 5 Stars with me! It is very simple & it works! CD's with 3 or more songs will not work for trying to fall asleep because they are to busy on your Brain! Good Luck & Sweet Dreams."
3,Just So So,"Liquid Mind VIII Sleep is better at promoting sleep. This is fine for relaxation, in my opinion."
5,Definitely helps me,"I have had this for almost a month now, and put it on every night. The CD is 60 minutes long, and I'm usually out well before it is finished. So far I have not had the need to put it on repeat and play all night. I can only think of one time when I had to repeat the disk and I was particularly restless and couldn't get to sleep. Try it."
3,Not special,After listening to it 10 times it gets really boring. Not special really. Electronic music and nothing else. Being bored to sleep isnt really all that restful.
5,Great multi-purpose hook.,"Great hook, for various uses. I love the rubber maid fast track sysyem, great organizer and very simple to use... I use this hook to hang up my ladder. Highly recommended."
5,Passenger Liners by Laurence Dunn,"For those who want one of the finest records of the entire world fleet of notable liners afloat and sailing at that time, including countless smaller combo-passenger cargo liners, you will find that this is without doubt the best book ever placed on the market, be it the first (1961) or second (1965) editions. The late Mr. Laurence Dunn was one of the finest maritime historians of his day, and every ship (or identical sisters) is supported by an excellent black and white photograph and a comprehensive description. This book is a must for those who love real passenger ships. Reuben Goossens - Maritime Historian [...]."
4,Secret Life of Cee Cee Wilkes,Excellent story. The author gets you hooked on Cee Cee from the beginning. I enjoyed this book and would read another by the same author.
5,AMAZING,"This is only the second time that I have written a review. All I have to say is, if you are here looking for a book to read. BUY THIS ONE! You can not put it down. I am here to buy all of her other books..................."
4,"Page Turner, Sleep Depriver","Never heard of Diane Chamberlain before, but I am sure glad that I ran into her book at Target. I found the story very interesting, and loved the way Ms. Chamberlain kept my interest going. I found the end answered a lot of my own story questions, and did not leave me wondering....I just ordered 3 more of her books. I do liken her to Jodi Picoult too, and that is a good thing isn't it? Is it a literary masterpiece, I do not think so, but then those most of the time are not page turners."
5,Amazing...,"This was the first novel that I have read by Chamberlain and I absolutely love it. I read this book in a matter of days (while working 12 hours shifts, too). I took it to work with me to read on lunch and I had friends comment on how good it ""looked."" I soon started lending this book to friends of mine who loved it as well. I don't want to talk about the content of the book just in case someone reading this is just trying to figure out how well the reviews are, haha. But never-the-less, this was a brilliant novel by a very talented author. I am now a huge fan of Diane Chamberlain!"
4,Great beach read,"Really enjoyed this book! My only complaint is that the ending seemed a little trite and could have used more grit. Otherwise, the characters were alive and well developed, the plot moved very well and the descriptions were perfect. Finished it in a day, neglecting pets, children and laundry."
4,Captivating!,"I really enjoy this author and still have more of her books to read. After reading a few others, I found this one hard to get into. But once I did, I didn't want to put it down. It was a little longer than I prefer, but a real page turner, great character development, a really good story that tugs at your heart and conscience. The only thing that prevented me from giving it 5* was the beginning, but plow on through and you will love it. It is a coming of age story, a killing, a mystery and lots of great characters that make this so good."
4,good read!,"I really enjoyed this book, I will certainly be reading more by Diane Chamberlain! She does a great job of developing the characters to where they get a grip on you and you want to keep reading. This was my first read by Chamberlain, she's got a new fan in me!"
2,I couldn't disagree more.....,"Wow....I couldn't believe how much I disagree with the other reviewers. I also like Diane Chamberlain's books, but this was not one of her best. I thought the characters were not very well developed at all. I think because of that I also could not get past the fact that they were not really likeable. The writing did not captivate. I had to force my way through it. I suggest borrowing from a friend or checking out at your local library and then form your own opinion!I'll certainly keep reading Chamberlain, but this one did not satisfy."
5,"Not a mystery reader, but I enjoyed alot","I saw this book on the Best Sellers Rack at Target and read the back. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Chamberlain sucked me in in the first chapter. The story has an amazing concept about underground societies helping protect those who want to lose their identities. CeeCee just wanted someone to love her, and that man came along and used her for her innocence. I loved how the entire time reading it, I kept asking myself, ""would I do the same thing?"" ""Would I be nieve enough to fall for the plans of her terrible boyfriend?"" Great summer read, read it in 2 days."
5,Beautifully written story!,"This is the story of character, CeeCee Wilkes, and the events of her life spanning from age 16 to 45.I don't want to spoil any of the storyline for you, but, just let me say~ this is a marvelous, well-written book that will not leave any of the Diane Chamberlain fans unhappy!Definitely a MUST read!"
4,Odd but engaging,"I have read many books that are forgettable enough that I could pick them up (or select them on my Kindle) a few years later and read them again and they would sound vaguely familiar, but it would be almost like reading them for the first time. There are a small percentage of books that stick with you...this book is definitely the latter. Definitely an engaging story, and the writer managed to bring the story to a conclusion that was quite surprising but fulfilling."
4,Good Read but Predictable,"I enjoyed this read as it was different from what I had been reading. The author is a good writer. However, I new what was going to happen the entire time. It still did not keep me from reading and enjoying the read."
5,The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes,"I love the way Diane Chamberlin develops her characters! This is the 4th or 5th book of hers that I have read, and is by far the best. Definately worth the read!"
2,The story line did not need the sleeze,The story line did not need the sleeze. Why the author found it neccesary I don't understand. It could have been good.
2,Fantasy,"Diane Chamberlain has a solid sense of the power of emotion over rational thought as well as the dynamics of interpersonal relationships. Unfortunately, she is not able to wrap this up in a story or characters that have any credibility."
1,Concerned Reader,"Being an avid inspirational reader, I was apprehensive when someone loaned this book to me. The story line was marvelous; however, the obscene words, explicit sex, issues mentioned in the story, were intolerable. An author doesn't have to put garbage in a book to be a ""New York Best Seller."" There are many wholesome writers who are on their best seller list. I give this book a 1 rating for the story line. My petition is for cleaner writting from a great story teller. Would read more of her books then."
4,"Enjoyable, quick read","This was the first book by Diane Chamberlain that I've read. It was quite good. A fast enjoyable read. I will agree that most of the characters, besides CeeCee weren't very developed, but because it was a fast read, that didn't bother me too much. While I can't say this is one of the best books I've ever read, it was good enough to add Diane Chamberlain to my ""must read"" authors list."
4,Love Women's Fiction,"As the author ofGateway to the Past (A romantic novel of a second chance granted by a grandmotherly ghost)by Lori Hayes, I love reading women's fiction. Diane Chamberlain delivers time and time again. I highly recommend this book."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I am an avid fan of Danielle Steel but have read all of her books to date and have been searching for a new author to read. I recently started reading Diane Chamberlain books based on the recommendations and reviews from Amazon and purchased this one. I read it in a matter of a couple of days...couldn't put it down! I enjoyed it so much, I purchased it for my mother who is also searching for a new author to enjoy. Buy and enjoy!!!!!"
5,great read,I have discovered Diane Chamberlain and all her stories are excellent. This one is particularily good. I could not leave it down so finished it in a very quick time. What will I do when i have trawled through all her stories;
4,Great read!,Couldn't put the book (actually ipad) down. Had to finish it to find out the ending! Great book with appropriate ending!
4,The Secret Life of CeeCee Wilkes,"I really enjoyed this novel. It chronicles the life of a young girl and a tragic pitfall that becomes her life. I could understand her point-you may not. It is a very contraversial point and many things to ponder in this book. What is right and wrong, and who decides???????????"
2,This book came highly recommended,I found the storyline and the characters to be highly unbelievable at every turn. It wasn't hard to get through but I felt very unsatisfied throughout the book. Most of the characters were very unlikeable with the exception for Jack and Dru who were both too-good-to-be-true. This is the only book I have read by this author and I'm not sure I would read another.
5,One of my Old Time Favorite Cartoons!,"I enjoyed this Cartoon when I was a Kid. I did not care if it was a cheap cartoon. I Loved Godzilla when I was a Kid and I still Love the Big Green Lizard. I'm so glad Season one is now complete on DVD, and I'm hoping for the second season, they just release it as a set."
5,It works well,It works exactly as advertised and I really like using it. My teeth feel really clean after using the Spinbrush.
5,Great value,Great value on replacement heads. They fit most tooth brushes made by Spin brush Proclean.Can't go wrong on the price.
5,Easy to find,Often can't find replacement heads in store where brushes sold.This was quick and easy.
4,"Good price, would like better longevity","This was a good price point compared to the local stores. Though, I've found that the brushes tend to go out rather fast (Somewhere in the 1.5 month to 2 month range).I'm sure some of it is them being soft heads, but I'd like to see them last a little longer before giving way."
4,Always a good value,You can buy these for a better price than at any store. They make your toothbrush feel like new again.
1,spinbrush refill,"I ordered this product after checking the photo(which is the correct one for me)and got a different brushhead, which does not fit my spinbrush. What a disappointment."
3,Spinbrush,The Spinbrush Proclean was just as was expected for replacement heads. What else is there to say about this product?
4,The bonus tracks detract,"This is a wonderful album which is slightly marred by the inclusion of two rather mediocre bonus tracks at the end. I think the industry should re-think the practice of adding tracks to re-issues if they are not up to snuff---as in this case. This alone, however, should not put anybody off buying the disc, which is otherwise a charming piece of work."
2,Completely overrated,"I don't see what all the hype surrounding this album is about. Sure, ""Tempted,"" ""Labelled With Love,"" and ""Messed Around"" are pretty good, but nearly all the rest of the songs on this cd are, at best, dull. I can't even listen to the really awful stuff like ""In Quintessence,"" ""Heaven,"" and ""Someone Else's Heart."" NOT worth the $, in my opinion."
3,Movie review!,"Marty was a good movie. The movie had a good plot of an Italian-American family. Good cultural values and clean cut movie but was disappointed with the ending. It left me hanging. Overall, a good movie to watch."
1,Missing Parts!,"Outrageously clipped! An entire scene, in fact the ONLY scene between Clara and her parents, is missing. What was the problem? Old people in their pajamas? A married couple in bed? TWIN beds! Their daughter expressing her thoughts on the events of the evening? This was a pivotal scene where the viewer sees things from Clara's perspective and really understands just how momentous this night has been, and how much more it could mean.What does a film have to do to deserve preservation? I would have thought that winning Best Picture for the year would be a good start!Shame on whoever made this decision!The movie INTACT receives a full five stars and an exclamation point."
1,Reviewing what?? the DVD or the VHS??,"What is wrong with Amazon? They keep mixing the reviews of the DVD and the VHS. It's important to read about the quality of the transfer and the media it is being transferred to, whether it is a DVD or a VHS. It is just as or more important than a review of the movie itself. Amazon should be more careful. These items are expensive. Very annoying."
5,review,"what a down to earth movie about a lonely guy looking for love, saw it on cable, had to have it"
5,Still the best intro to Unitarian Universalism,"Despite the denomination's general adoption of the newer A Chosen Faith by Buehrens and Church, this book is still the best all-in-one introductory guide to Unitarian Universalism. Some will find it too heavy on the history of both faiths; however, the bulk of the book treats what it means to be a UU as well as answering commonly asked questions.Unfortunately, as ""A reader"" remarked, while large chain bookstores generally stock A Chosen Faith, they will not have this title, and an order for it may take longer than for titles in more demand currently. Nevertheless, this book is well worth it, particularly for someone on a budget who can't afford the nearly $30 for both A Chosen Faith and 100 Questions, the two books that together cover what this one volume includes."
3,Unfortunate effort,"The subject matter here is no doubt fascinating, but this effort leaves us guessing why. We're left with the troubling impression that Zelda was raised to rely on every gift except substance, and that she ultimately suffered from the realization that life is best -- or only -- lived substantively. Not exactly a piece of original thinking, and one searches in vain for more lasting lessons, or even ideas. What makes this search so ultimately fruitless is the author's decided lack of skill, both as researcher and chronicler, and the disturbing suspicion that this ""biography"" is nothing more than a personal attempt by the author to don Zelda's party clothes, to be the belle of the ball, or to be -- even temporarily -- interesting. Sad, and profoundly unfair to the subjects of this needlessly lengthy piece of ""Page 6"" journalism. Scott and Zelda deserve much more."
3,Sometimes Madness Is Wisdom - Zelda & Scott Revisted.,"This is an incredibly detailed and ""worthy"" biography, obviously put together through intensive research, but at the end we are left with an intimate knowledge of the minutia of the Fitzgerald marriage but very little real insight into what made this infamous couple tick. As adults they behaved like irresponsible, self-indulgent children and at the end the reader is left wondering if they really deserved the amount of literary and academic attention they have received over the years. For Fitzgerald buffs this book is a must but for anyone wishing to gain real insight into why both Zelda and Scott and their marriage disintegrated so quickly and so spectacularly, sadly, this book is a disappointment."
2,zelda fitzgerald,"This book, if one wants to believe, provides new information that is interesting, but a lot seems to be sensationalist conjecture. The author writes about the treaments of Zelda's disease used at the time, which one can believe she went through, but her interpretations of Zelda's thoughts and actions cannot be backed up with any proof. The author's analysis is sophmoric, and full of factual mistakes: ""Noonie"" was Zelda's neice, not her cousin, for example. If this author can write a biography, anyone can. Mitford's book still remains the best source on Zelda, and if that book disturbed Scottie Fitzgerald, this one would have made her hair stand on end. If you like yellow jounalism, you'll like this."
2,Rambling Wisdom,"I am impressed with Kendall Taylor's supreme effort in writing this book. She has invested a great deal of her life, some thirty years, in researching all the material. It is a very interesting biography, but it seems she tries to do too much. There are so many details of the Fitzgeralds' friends and contemporaries that one gets bogged down in details. There are many repetitions of facts, and areas where one sees poor editing and sentence structure errors. It would appear that the author spent too much time on the book, and therefore its presentation is somewhat disjointed and disorganized. I would have preferred to see more emphasis on Zelda herself, instead of anecdotes regarding her frivolous lifestyle."
2,Disappointing Ramble,"Although the author, Kendall Taylor, begins her biography with a disdainful look at how all biographies of Zelda are about F. Scott Fitzgerald, she proceeds to do the same thing, badly.Not only does she discuss the friendship between the Fitzgerald's and the Hemingways. she also discuss all of their friends, enemies and the possible lovers of these same friends and enemies.There is nothing new. The biography is not well written, which I generally expect from a English professor (too self-involved.} Beside the mediocre writing, the proofing is terrible, as is the editing--if there was any--leaving mistakes and errors galore.If the reader is interested in Zelda and her descent into madness and what happened after Scott died, chose another book. I'm sorry I wasted the time and money on this one."
5,Triumph Over Tragedy,"The experiences that shaped John Carlos are made vivid by the CD Jackson biography titled ""Why?"" It brought to life the inner struggles he experienced as a young athlete who had to struggle with both racism and a learning disorder. His strength of character and strong beliefs in fairness and justice prevailed over his desire for personal success. This same strength sustained him in his later life when personal tragedy struck him repeatedly. It is a book whose message will not be forgotten."
4,John Carlos - WHY,"As the Civil Rights struggle was brewing in the 60's and mainstream schools from across the nation finally embraced African-American students, although mainly to gain a competitive advantage in their athletic programs, John Carlos articulates the struggle in a powerful way. Some see it as a ""black issue"" but believe me his dispels that notion by communicating the ""Human Struggle"" he and others lived through.1968 was a remarkable year and with all that is written, this book will provide a better perspective of how athletics and politics are intertwined. John Carlos deserves a gold medal for presenting ""WHY."""
2,didn't work for me,"I wanted to like this book far more than I did. It had so many good ideas, potentially interesting plot points or character points or just something I hadn't seen before, but it never quite got off the ground for me. I liked the introduction, liked meeting Sebastian and learning about him, but his and Olivia's interactions didn't work and I didn't believe their relationship or care enough about either of them to spend 300 + pages. I started to skim, then jump, then jump backwards and even with all that dancing around, it didn't add up. Because I couldn't read it from beginning to end, I didn't give it 3 stars (my minimum requirement for a 3 star rating - that I read the complete book) and I put it back in the reswap pile."
1,HORRID,"I am a voracious reader and an historical romance reader in particular - and I must say, out of all of the historical romances that I've finished, this is BY FAR the worst I've ever read. HORRID.The hero of the story is MEAN. Just plain mean. For instance - our heroin was accidentally locked in a dungeon that floods during bad storms by the hero. And of course after she's locked in, a bad storm erupts, flooding her cell and forcing her to move with the water thru a tunnel that empties out over a cliff. Our hero, upon seeing her clinging to the side of the cliff, knowing what happened states ""I'm going to wring her neck"". SERIOUSLY? For what, surviving? And he goes on in that vein, calling her a fool. That's just one example, though I could have put MANY.This book isn't worth reading even if free. I can't imagine who these other readers are that have given this book 4 and 5 star reviews. Although I've indicated 1 star in mine, I'd rather have given it 0 stars. Don't waste your time, folks."
1,Could the hero be any more unlikable????,"I do love a great regency/historical book. That being said, I dislike more than I like. I guess I am particular. But one thing that has to be strong in any book is a desire to finish! And one needs to be interested in the characters. Sebastian Alexander is perhaps one of the most unlikable hero's (and I use that term loosely) I have ever read. Sure, handsome, but there was really not a facet of his personality that came across as likeable so unless our feisty spinster Olivia has a martyr complex, why be interested? And yes, Sebastian spent 12 years at sea but geeze, sorry, having zero manners does not make that much sense. I found him creepy is his coldness. And the murder mystery just did not hold my attention."
2,My least favorite Jewel book,I read about four of her books already and I did not like this one at all. I hoped it was going to be like Scandal. It dragged. I did not like the heroine. Scandal I think was the best. I actually tossed this book after reading it. I don't usually do that.
3,not my favorite :(,"I love Carolyn Jewel. Just wanted to get that out before my review. I usually love her historicals but not this one. I have never read a story where I hated the hero before. I didn't even like him in the end of it. He is awful! Now believe me, I don't mind a hero who is a bit cruel at first. One who overcomes his faults and redeems himself. The hero is cold throughout the whole thing. Amazingly the heroine falls in love with him inspite of his cruelty. I just couldn't believe it. She was supposed to be smart and witty. It made no sense to me. Good writer just bad story for me. Three stars only because I was able to finish it without breaking my kindle."
5,Every woman should get this!,"I refer to this book almost every day! Everything you ever wanted to know about the benefits of herbs for women, in an easy-to-use format. If you can only buy one book about herbs, this is the one!"
4,Great book!,"This book is awesome! It was one of the first books I checked out from my local library when I began to be interested in herbal healing. I decided it was worth purchasing, and found a used copy for wicked cheap! The book just needed the cover cleaned off a bit, and it was good as new! I love this book, and still look to it often!"
3,"Somewhat insightful, but needs an update","While there are some good points made in this book, it was hard to get past the outdated nature of the examples and data that is included. References to consoles stop at the Gamecube/Xbox/PS2, and EverQuest is the ""big MMORPG"" they explain to the non-gamers. I think it would be very interesting to see how the data in this book may have changed with the Nintendo DS and Wii causing a larger amount on traditional non-gamers to get involved. Overall there are some good conclusions drawn that can be helpful for the non-gamer to understand their counterparts better, but a refresh is definitely in order."
4,Intergenerational Reading,"If you are over 34 and want to understand how those young multitaskers manage their hectic lives, and if you are under 34 and want to understand how those mono-attentional dinosaurs maintain concentration, this book is for you.This book is a good balance of conjecture and data derived from a large questionnaire."
4,The Kids are Alright: How the Gamer Gereatin is Changing the Workplace,"This book has been an ""eye-opener"" for our entire family. Our 14 year old grandson is a ""Gamer"" and we used to worry that he was wasting away his valuable growing years. We all read the book however, including our grandson, and now we can sit back and enjoy our ""Gamer."""
2,Are you kidding me?,"With all due respect - what a load of hooey! The tone of the book is insulting, and the inferences drawn from survey data are often leaps of imagination. This book, apparently written by aging boomers who are fearing for their jobs, treats gamers like an alien invasion. There are nuggets of useful wisdom, but you have to pick through the work with a fine-toothed comb to find them. The book's central message - that games are a part of American culture now and are as much a driving force as movies and television - should be obvious to anyone who does not live in a cave in the mountains and is not worth the pages of repetition the authors spent on drilling it home."
2,not terribly comfortable,"Something about the front ankle portion of the boot is really inflexible, and therefore kind of uncomfortable to walk in."
2,Havel Without Zappa,"What happens when you strip away all that was counter-cultural and leftish about Vaclav Havel's political and dramatic writings? As this book demonstrates, you get a version of Havel that neo-cons have been peddling since President Bush the 1st and Francis Fukuyama: a Vaclav Havel who appears to be a quirky surrogate for American conservative thought. True, Havel drifted into this mold during his presidency years of the 1990s. But the ""dissident"" Havel of the 70s and 80s was no Leo Strauss. And the attempt to squeeze him into this framework, as this book does, is pretty unsatisfying. The Anglophone world still needs an introductory book on Havel - such as Pontuso's attempts to be - that strives for real, academic distance on the subject."
2,I did not know this ....,was a trilogy either. It is not mentioned anywhere on the book jacket. I am not sure if knowing this would change my rating though. The book is very slow moving. I stopped at page 70 or so. The first 70 pages and perhaps the rest of the book are truly a history of India (and Britain's control of it). I found the history very interesting but there was not much of a story going on here. I was looking for more of a storyline than a history text.
2,Disappointed,"At times this book is interesting, but overall it is tedious and doesn't seem to be well edited. Less important parts of it discussing communication theory and other technical things seem far fetched. I did learn some things about the Raj, that I imagine to be true, and if that is the case, the British are more guilty than I thought they were prior to reading this."
3,"Needed a ""This is a sequel"" designation on the cover","READ ""DESIRABLE DAUGHTERS"" FIRST.I'd even go with 3.5 stars -- though perhaps I would have enjoyed it more and ranked it higher if I'd known this was a sequel prior to reading it. I have ordered the first book ""Desirable Daughters"" and hope that ""Tree Bride"" comes together more fully after I've read the first installment.Nothing on my hardback copy of ""Tree Bride"" indicated it is a sequel -- QUITE disappointing and, as it turned out, it lessened my appreciation of this book quite a bit.Well-written, definitely -- Ms. Mukherjee is a talented writer. It just seemed disjointed and, I thought, could have benefited greatly from inclusion of a family tree. Perhaps with the first book as background I might not have needed a family tree -- I do not yet know."
4,Offers good protection for your camera,"I like it, use it often, have the larger one and wish this there was one in-between the two. I still use film and will continue to do so until film is no longer available and this backpack doesn't give me enough room for the camera body, two lenses and the lead-lined bag I use to transport film through airports.I guess if you have a digital camera this would be large enough."
5,It's good to read good books,"This book has everything. RC runs all the gamut that can be run in a book. Here you'll read about a non corresponded love, a very strong parental love, a relentless quest for a next of kin and a non abiding cop among other things. But the must important thing is that the main story will compel you to read faster than you can, and that means it's a good book.So the least stars for this book are SIX stars"
4,"Not Crais's best, but still very good","Robert Crais is a terrific mystery writer, and this book will not disappoint his fans.Summary, no spoilers:The first short chapter details a horrific crime, as two policemen respond to a call, and find a family savagely murdered in their home.The rest of the book is told from multiple characters points of view (including a deranged psychopath,) as P.I. Elvis Cole investigates the murder of a strange, tattooed man in downtown L.A., who's last words indicated that he was Cole's birth father.The book started out a little slowly for me (after that first intense chapter), but then it really picked up and I read the last 200 pages without even getting up to stretch my legs.There are some good ""twists"", by book's end, and along the way the reader finds out some interesting information about Elvis Cole's childhood, and helps us understand what makes him tick.Recommended for fans of hard-boiled detective fiction."
3,"If you're new to the Elvis Cole Series, Don't Start Here","This isn't really a b-a-d book, but had I some how managed to pick it up first rather than Monkey's Raincoat I never would have read another book in the series. And that would have been my loss. The thing is by now I care about the characters ... all of them, Elvis, Joe, Chen, Starkey ... okay, maybe not Lucy because I found her annoying and was glad to see her go. Anyway, I'm still glad I read it because it filled in some background and I'll probably re-read it later on because it's good enough I'm willing to give it a second try."
2,Where's the beef?,"I've read a few Crais books and when he's good, I'm a huge fan. There is always some satisfaction in visiting old characters but this one stretches it pretty thin. In fact the book feels so weak and the story as a whole so pointless, you wonder what the point is. It's the kind of book from a good writer that can kill a series and makes you question the genre. It's not thrilling and it's not mysterious so what is it? And chapters that are half a page? Come on. There's just not allot of meat on the bones and I felt myself working hard to just get through it. Usually on holidays I roar through books like these. This one? I crawled."
3,RT Wright,"I enjoy the books Crais writes. This particular one seemed to meander a bit. The pace was slower with less action. While the prior novels he has written I have wanted to read straight through, this one was easy to set down. It was still a good book."
2,not much there,I really did not enjoy this book and am glad to be finishrd with it .... the story line was interesting - unbelieveable but interesting ... the action and character development was weak ...
4,Very Good,"This isn't Crais's best book (that would be ""L. A. Requiem""), but it is still very good.In the first place, it contains almost none of Lucy--a definite step forward.In the second, it contains quite a lot of Starkey (from ""Demolition Angel""), and she is interesting and unpredictable.In the third, it manages to deal with Elvis Coles's family and background in an offbeat and intriguing way. (Unlike Sue Grafton's regrettable efforts to go into Kinsey Milhone's family, say.)The best thing may be Crais's wonderful depiction of Cole's aloneness. This is the classic alienation of the private detective, and Crais does it marvelously.The only bad thing is the near-absence of Pike. Still, a very fine book."
2,A big disappointment,"""The Forgotten Man"" is a far cry from ""The Last Detective."" It wanders for 356 pages to a ridiculous ending. Overwritten and not at all helped by the whining Carol Starkey and her fantasies about Elvis Cole."
2,Fair at best,"I was a fan of Crais' up until Hostage and The Last Detective. Thought I would try one more book and bought the e-book version of the Forgotten Man. The book feels forced to me. The plot seems superficial and simple with no real relevance except to offer a stage for character development. Pike is relegated to a throw-away character with no real role which is a real shame. Carol is back but for no good reason. I would recommend that you stay away from this one and read the early books with real mystery/detective stories and where the relationship between Pike and Cole takes center stage. Also, do not buy the adobe ebook version if you plan on reading this on a Palm. The conversion is Horrendous!"
2,Shouldn't be listed as a mystery...,"This book would have made a nice side note in the series but it's not really a mystery. The whole premises seems stupid as to why he is even involved in this case in the 1st place. I think if we wanted to investigate Cole's origins, it could have been done in a much better fashion -- say Last Detective style. I guess I can't stop thinking at how long we've waited for this book and this is all the fans got? It's not much of a mystery and Joe barely has any space in the book. He really shouldn't of even been mentioned! And is it just me or was Carol Starkey always that dumb and co-dependent? Because she is really, really annoying in this book... hope that Robert Crais has fleshed out these characters demons and we can get back to a good mystery one of these days."
2,Not One of the Better Elvis Cole Novels,"I am a big fan of Robert Crais, but I feel that the quality of his novels has been slipping recently. ""The Forgotten Man"" continues this downward trend, in my opinion. The plot in this novel feels contrived and forced. When the ""real"" criminal is finally exposed at the end, this ""surprise twist"" is not realistic - mostly due to weak character development.Joe Pike is my favorite character, and he is completely wasted in this novel. Carol Starkey returns, and the inclusion of her character is totally unnecessary (and, quite a distraction at times). Crais always has good dialogue in his novels, and even his weaker works are better than most authors' best attempts. However, I strongly recommend his earlier works for those who have not yet read any of his novels."
2,Last Crais I'll read for a while,I enjoy reading authors who have recurring characters and Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are great. I read every book Crais wrote from the beginning and have found them to be fun to read and hard to put down. But with this book I have lost my desire to continue. His books are getting a little too violent but most of all I don't like the way his books end now. The heroes win but pay too great a price. I recommend the earlier books but not this one.
2,Forgotten Man Should be,"I have read every Crais Book based on Elvis and would give each one 4.5 or 5 stars. Elvis is a ""character"" as is ""Pike"" and I found each previous book impossible to put down.I did not care for Forgotten Man as we learned about his past (Elvis) and much relived via flashbacks. The story was a bit convoluted as an excuse to tell us about the Elvis as a child, etc. Don't need it.Frankly, I do not care about the past of Elvis because I enjoy him as he is. Also felt this book did not give us the wisecracking gumshoe that is so much fun with Elvis and Pike.I guess I don't think you need to flesh out something that is perfect to begin with. As they say, ""if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.""Elvis lives but not to my taste in this book.Bring back more of what we have in the past. I would find it hard to recommend this one."
5,Coles Biggest Case,"Without a doubt, this is the best in Robert Crais' extremely well-recieved Elvis cole series. I finished the book last night and I am still thinking about it. This is a doorkicking, heart - grabber of a story. I defy anyone to read the first few pages and then put the book down. Impossible.."
3,Should have been better,"I've read all the Elvis Cole novels and I found this one to be lacking cohesion.There was just too much going on and the basic premise of the story turned out to be unfulfilling.I'm not going to get into re-telling the story because that has been done by other reviewers. I would have liked to have had Joe Pike more involved in the story.I feel he is a much more interesting character than Elvis Cole.The pointless inclusion of the ex-girlfriend and Detective Starkey's pathetic pining for Cole was a waste of paper.I gave it 3 stars because even though it was not up to Robert Crais usual standards, it was alright."
4,The Forgotten Man,"At the scene of a crime, a gunshot victim tells an officer that he is looking for his son, Elvis Cole. By the time Elvis is notified and reaches the man, he has passed away. Elvis isn't sure whether he is related to the dead man or not. While growing up, his mother never divulged the identity of his real father, and Elvis has been searching all his life for this mysterious person.Elvis and his partner, Joe Pike, along with LAPD detective Carol Starkey, begin an intense search to identify the dead man. What they unearth reveals a man with a secret past linked to murder. Unknown to Elvis, he has been targeted by a killer who is intent on keeping the secret intact.The plot was easy to follow and the mystery fairly easy to resolve. This is a well-written novel, especially pertaining to Elvis's feelings about his childhood and his unknown father. The Elvis Cole series continues to strengthen with each outing and reveal, layer by layer, what makes Elvis Cole tick."
4,Helpful Because of Context,"I have to agree... the bad review seems to be another book. Yes, the author does mention specific products that he prefers. This is a far cry from, ""You must buy this to be successful."" I appreciated the candor.Because this book is written from one perspective, you get a lot of anecdotes, opinions, and insights as well as humor. It's not a field guide written by committee at a magazine. So it has a very human touch and a lot of hunting stories to illustrate the point being made.We are a story-telling people. The author is a journalist and seems to understand brevity, telling a good tale, and conveying essential information. For someone entirely new to hunting this is a very good read."
2,Largely Disappointing,"I'm very glad I found this at the library before ordering it. This book is essentially a bunch of commercials for companies whose products the author uses and/or which are owned by his hunting buddies (e.g., the section on blackpowder which is one big ad for rifles made by pal Tony Knight) interspersed with yarn after yarn which relate ad nauseam what a deadeye Richey is in a ground blind or treestand. I understand that an instructor has to establish his credibility AND illustrate that his lessons work, but the me-great-hunter stuff gets old in a hurry. If you were to cull the useful information out of this book of stories, it would amount to about two type-written pages.This Lyons Press edition is also a retread. The work was originally published in 1986 by Outdoor Life Books as Hunting Fringeland Deer. That was a much more accurate title; I'm afraid this one isn't the ""Ultimate Guide"" to anything. See any of the Greg Miller books instead."
5,Very highly recommended,"Daniel eagerly awaits a promised ride in his older brother Hector '63 Impala convertible “complete with spider hydraulics and gold wire wheels.” Together they celebrate the first weekend of summer vacation. They turn up the volume on their music and cruise, transforming the Impala into “a funky barrio carnival ride.” They join the cool cars cruising the beech before visiting the cousin. When the ride is over, Hector promise the car to Daniel if he finishes high school and plans to go to college.Author Michael Perry brings his street-savvy writing style to children’s books in DANIEL’S RIDE. With the lyricism gained with his musical background, and an intense understanding of what motivates children, Perry creates a fun, hotrodding tale of sun, brothers and cars certain to delight young readers. Crisp, believable, readable dialog combine lends the story vibrant energy and promise. Very highly recommended."
5,Daniel's Ride is tite,Daniel's Ride is an exellent book for children. I should know because I am a child. I think this is a good book because people usually don't write about lowriders or books for kids who are bilingual. This book has both of those subjects.
5,quality,Works great! ...just as if I had purchased the product from the dentist. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,.......and there are other uses,"This makes a great purse. I had been suffering from fashionista back problems due to too much weight in the purses I carry. Black is my essential color and I feel comfortable carrying it almost anywhere. I can carry it over my shoulder but high because of the sturdy, adjustable straps and if I drop it, the padding in the bag protects any breakable items. I am now on my second Sideline Shooter bag after having used my first one for eight years.... and, by the way, it washes well, dries fast in spite of all the padding, and retains its shape. Now I can use the old one as my camera bag!!"
2,Just okay,"First time I heard it, I liked it. On subsequent plays, I liked it lesser and lesser to the point that I don't listen to this CD anymore. I just can't. SHK's touch on the sitar is too soft for my liking. I really had to strain to hear his strokes over the drone and tabla (contrast that with the crystal clear crisp note rendition of Ravi Shankar) in the second track. The other issue is that I find his playing to be very repetitive. Particularly when contrasted with someone like Ravi Shankar, whose creative genius leaps out in the way he improvises, in SHK's case, there isn't nearly enough of improvisation. That said, the compositions he plays are truly very beautiful."
5,Great Pack - Affordable Price,"The High Sierra ""Ridgeline"" pack is exactly what I was looking for. Something sturdy, able to hold two water bottles and not overly big and cumbersome. The deciding factor to select this particular pack was the reviews on the product from current owners. Several other packs had a place for only one water bottle, the water bottle section was too shallow and/or the pack was too small or too large.High Sierra Ridgeline is perfect for a day hike, holding a lunch or some snacks, place to securely keep car keys, a small camera, suntan lotion etc. The pack is very comfortable and quite adjustable to 'fit' many sizes. Highly recommend."
4,Satisfied Overall with High Sierra Ridgeline Lumbar Pack,"After using the pack on a recent hike, I found the pack roomy and sturdy enough for a day hike. The water bottles were fine except that one of the bottles slipped out of the pocket even though I thought that it was strapped in properly. Now, I need another bottle to replace that one. As with most fanny packs, it tends to slip down some during walking, so I would suggest that the manufacturer include an over the shoulder strap arrangement to hold it up and help distribute some of the weight up to the shoulders. I would recommend it as a good buy."
4,Excellent for 1/2 day hike.,"This is the perfect size fanny pack for a 1/2 day hike. I can even fit another bottle of water inside along with my apple, sandwich, power bars, camera, chapstick, compass, tissues, and whatever. I didn't like the plastic bottles that come with this but I just switched them out my own and they fit just fine in the side pockets."
5,Great Pack,This is a very comfortable pack. Holds quite a bit more than expected. The large main compartment opens up for easy access to packed items. It's perfect for day hikes. I strapped a sleeping bag to the top of it and used it for an overnight pack. The water bottles are only 16oz. so I used 20 oz soda bottles and they worked fine with the pack.
3,"Nice pack, but way too big for my needs","The Ridgeline products are all quality products, but for what I needed, this bag was WAY too big - on the order of a small tote bag. Now, if you need something that will carry pretty much what a medium size purse would carry, then this is the bag for you. If you're looking for something that's a more manageable (ie common) size in a fanny pack, this isn't it. The measurements are misleading, but don't get me wrong, it's a nice pack... just too big for me."
4,Good Quality Product,"The pack is very well made and has a lot of great features. It's actually bigger than what I really needed. I wanted something I could easily pack my essentials in while bike riding as well as something I could use as a camera bag or carry bag while vacationing. I think it's great if your going to be out all day and need to easily carry your essentials, however it's just too big for short excursions."
2,Recieved CURAD product,Recieved a CURAD product instead of the NONNET07 product that I ordered. The CURAD product does not have the retention for reuse.
4,The reasonableness of the regulative principle.,"I am amazed that pastors would argue against the principle of God providing guidance to His creatures regarding our worship of him, but many do. That said, the author wonderfully addresses the regulative principle with maturity and simplicity. I recommend this short read to every Christian who takes seriously the admonition to worship God in spirit and in truth."
4,Not a certification book,"If you are looking for good reference material for the TCP/IP exam by Novell, this is not a one stop shop. It covers about 3/4th's of the information for the exam if you use it for that purpose as I did. I did found some great how to's about migrating and running my Netware 5 environment and make things a little better. But this book is not great if you are looking for certification. Yet it is the only one out there that comes close."
5,Rocks Gems and Minerals,awesome book-it is my grandson's favorite inthe world. He had one and lost it and we were so glad to fnd it again. He has been glued to it for a total of 4 years and he is 9 yrs old.
4,Good reference,This book is a good reference to identify rocks. I bought it for a 10 year old boy to help identify rocks in his collection.
3,short and thin...,"Thin, semi informative, didn't apply very well to what I was doing, but it had some good information. Gave me a taste of what I was looking for, but had to go elsewhere for indepth knowledge."
4,Buy This Disc,"If you're a fan of Bob Dylan, Badly Drawn Boy, or anything left of the mainstream, Simple Kid is for you. He's got a quirky vioce that smacks of Neil Young, and a sound that bounces all over the place. ""Staring at thr Sun"" and ""Truck On"" are the most accessable tracks, but others like ""Average Man"" and ""Drugs"" are socially irreverent and fun. Buy it if you dare to be different. It's bound to be popular, and that starts with you."
3,"Nice Case, Inflexible Interior","I bought this for a Canon HFS100 camcorder since it's a ""medium size camcorder."" It works, but not well. The HFS100 requires the full length and width of the interior compartment so while the padded flexible separator is there, it's useless. You have three basic choices. 1. put the camcorder in first, and the accessories on top. 2.put the accessories in first and the camera on top. 3. Put the camcorder, battery and light in the bag and the wires and thin accessories, such as the charger in the side pockets. If you choose 1 or 2 you may want to make your own pad separator to protect the camera.I've posted a picture with the Canon HFS100 inside the TBC-5.Otherwise, the case is well made, nice padding, nice size pockets. Seems sturdy.Canon VIXIA HFS100 HD Flash Memory Camcorder w/10x Optical Zoom"
5,Very nice,"I have enjoyed my Case Logic TBC-5 Medium Size Camcorder Case. I like to be able to carry both my camcorder and digital camera, also all the accessories that are needed when out on the road. It is not bulky, very comfortable to carry and does not take up a lot of space. This is a very nice case and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,I couldn't wait to watch this again...,"As someone who is a lover of biographies, especially political biographies, I was thrilled the first time that PBS ran this series on the Rockefellers. I only knew bits and pieces about the family from articles that I read. But, watching the miniseries really sparked my fascination. To see how the family evolved from the patriarch, old ""devil"" Bill Rockefeller, into the philanthropic dynasty that we know was a particularly interesting journey. I would encourage everyone to buy this series because it combines all the elements of a good story: love, sex, angst, losses and victories. You won't be disappointed."
3,"Interesting, but Too Long","""The Rockefellers"" is well researched documentary of a family with power going beyond money alone. It is over three hours long, and could have been done in less than two hours to get the main points and still hold interest. Overall it shows the shady beginnings and the family's ultimate mission of public service."
2,Suffers from typical PBS faults,"The program is annoying in a number of ways. First it is quite superficial. It never goes into any detail re how the fortune was built up. Rockefeller just suddenly owns a big refinery and is on the way to riches. You never learn how he managed to assemble the money for his first refinery. Then it has a parade of pointless commentators. Why do PBS productions always need a parade of people making one or two minute comments all the time. They are simply identified as ""historians"". Affiliated where? What justifies calling them that? Do they just appear and say ""I am an historian and want to be hired to make comments""? Most of the comments don't add anything to the story and some of them obviously dramatize what little they have to say to shine in their two minutes of glory. The background sounds are excessive. The content is so thin that everything the DVD says could be said in half the time. Another PBS failure of a production."
3,"***1/2 Good, not great.","""Place In The Sun"" #19 (1977).3rd album ""Place In The Sun"", is a fairly good album, nice title track #42, followed by their 1st big hit ""Whatcha Gonna Do"" #6 and the smooth ""Raging Fire"". You also get the spunky ""Never Had A Love"" #87 and the mellow rocker ""Atlanta June"". Last album with bassist Bud Cockrell."
3,A Place in the Sun,"A few really good songs, but a bunch of filler is thrown in. Best one to buy is Worlds Away. Far better."
4,Responding to God,"Amy Carmichael, missionary to south India from 1895 till her death in 1951, tells the story of the Dohnavur Fellowship, a group of men and women dedicated to discerning God's guidance for their lives and actions and following that guidance. The Fellowship had a significant impact in southern India, saving many children from the abusively destructive fate of Hindu temple prostitution. Gold Cord is an inspiring and instructive volume on the topic of being wholly dedicated to Christ and how to follow His guidance in a practical way in the midst of opposition and difficulty."
3,Gold Cord by Amy Carmichael,"I really love Amy Carmichael's poetry and also enjoy the 40-day devotional, ""You Are My Hiding Place,"" so I was surprised when I had a hard time with Gold Cord. Most times I couldn't follow how Miss Carmichael processed the events of her life, although I did understand the conclusions and spiritual lessons learned. It was a disappointment because other writings confirm that she was a most extraordinary disciple of Christ."
3,Disney Classics: Toy Story 2 Active Game,I bought this for my 6 year old grandson. We had a very difficult time at first knowing how to play the game. We gave up after awhile and his dad figured out how to play it and now he loves the game.There should be a manual with clear directions so anyone can understand how to play the game.
5,Pure Genious!,"The author combines a series of various origami techniques (box pleating being the most predominant) to create lifelike musicians out of uncut paper squares (only two exceptions: the dollar bill guitarrist and the awesome leaping guitarrist that is made of a rectangle). It is a challenging book, but perseverance will be rewarded! Instructions were extremelly well written. A definitive must for someone looking for a uniquely themed book (other than the many other books devoted to animals and geometric patterns) and also a great guide to develop multiple paperfolding techniques! Great work Marc! A true masterpiece!"
3,Just OK for this price..but a little bit disapointmented.,"The first, this is made by china.But I liked this color and shape.But I found small rust spots after using 3 month later.I think if you want to use for guest and keep longer, then it'll be better choose another set."
1,You get what you pay for,"Although inexpensive, I was not impressed with the quality of this hat. There was glue hanging from the plastic star attached to the front of the hat."
1,Get what you pay for.,Very disappointed. Did not fit grandson's head at all. But -- you get what you pay for and this was cheap. Recommend getting a better one and spend a little more money.
5,A great game wrapped in a brilliant story,"Psychonauts is quite likely the best platform game ever released on any platform.The game is smart, funny, challenging and overwhelming creative. There is even a level seemingly dedicated to the artistic stylings of Mark Ryden.I've enjoyed platform games like Ratchet and Clank, Jax, and Katamari Damaci, but Psychonauts leaves them all in the dust.This title gets my highest recommendation."
4,"Fun, trippy game","I love Psychonauts. The graphics aren't super new and flashy, but to be honest, it doesn't matter as much when the storyline is this compelling. I find that I love picking up this game. There are a few annoying parts, but generally any repetitiveness or frustrating parts of the game don't last long."
2,psychonuts,"This is a fun game to play but the one thing that REALLY got on my nerves was the 35 second load time. Every time you head towards a different part of camp you ""load"" and that takes forever. No other games I have played wasted time with constant loading. You can't have everything."
2,"Fun Game, but so many bugs!!!","I love the concept--but it's too free form, and there are so many bugs (concentrated mainly at the end of the game, suggesting that they rushed to get it out the door). I had to use an online faq/walkthrough to actually navigate the game, because often times I just couldn't figure out what I was supposed to be doing. And by the time I hit the last stage, i had constant freezes at important moments. I haven't been able to get it to work for long enough that i can finish it and I'm fed up. I'm gonna sell it and buy a good game that works."
5,A Must Have in Your PS2 Collection,"Didn't know quite what to expect when I purchased this game, but based on positive reviews I took a chance...and I'm so happy I did. Psychonauts is now one of my all time favorite games!! Each world was a pure pleasure to explore, the game was entertaining and sufficiently challenging, and I loved all the humor. I really hope that the game creators will soon give us a sequel.Get a copy while you can; I've recently read that they are no longer printing copies of the game."
4,A peek at the past,"I read 109 East Palace for a public library adult discussion group here in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Several people who either currently work at Sandia Labs or are recently retired from there attended the discussion.The group (27 in attendance) was very positive about this book and appreciated learning many of the details of daily life at Los Alamos during the development of the atomic bomb.This is an easy read and chronicles a very important event in the World War II era. Whether or not you agree with the use of atomic weapons, this is an informative book and gives a unique perspective. It is well worth reading."
5,Nostalgia,"I was a pre-teen during WWII living on a farm and was negatively impacted by all of the bad news coming out of the war. Not until the last year of the war, did the US seem to be winning. The scenario was not terribly different than we are hearing today.Against this background, I am always interested to read details of what was actually happening in various elements of the war effort. 109 East Palace is one of those marvelous reads of men and women accomplishing wonders that helped to bring the war to an end. This is better than science fiction!"
3,Sociopolitics of bomb making,"The book offers some insight into the personal relationships of the major players in the A-bomb project, but not much in the way of science.Some of the illustritive writing is carelessly inaccurate. In chapter 16, ""A Dirty Trick"" pp.291-292 it says: ""Trucks, loaded with tons of batteries, caables, and transistors, barreled through town...."" As the transitor was not invented until 1947, I'd say the trucks were probably carrying vacuum tubes instead. One wonders what other technical comments were pulled out of thin air."
1,This book was terrible,"Like Larry's other drivel, this book was basically his attempt to make more money off the backs of his followers. Rather than pretending to give advice that will supposedly change your life for the better (laugh) Larry takes the approach in this one of just plain rambling for the sake of it. I'm sure he figured that if he churned out another book, many of his sheep, I mean fans, would snap it up in a heartbeat just to get the latest dose of Larry's wisdom.Do yourself a favor, save your money and stop buying into this garbage. Larry is about as interesting and original as watching paint dry. The shock value, in your face stuff, and the point-out-the-obvious routine has already been overdone for years now, it's not refreshing and it's not funny.Typical Larry Winget, and by that I mean utter and completely garbage. Avoid this steaming pile of manure and save your money."
3,Alright,"The main thing i like bout this dude is his hair! LOL. His cd's alright but it gets boring after the 2nd listen. The tunes have no real ""feeling"" or ""message"" at all. It's mostly a big sappy love letter for those of ya who are interested"
2,Cute but cheap. :(,"Bought these for work to add a little humor to the day. The glue on the sticky notes was horrible. If you COULD get them apart, they didn't stick to anything."
5,Moving and Eye-Opening,"I have been a fan of Barry's ever since I rang doorbells for him in the California primary -- and even for me this film is full of surprises. I did not previously know about many things that are revealed here. Overall, the film is a moving elegy to the conservatism that might have been. A hawk on foreign policy, Goldwater was really a libertarian on domestic issues (hence the ignorant myth that he ""became a liberal"" at the end). He had no use for the ""social values"" conservatism that emerged in the seventies and triumphed in 1980."
5,mr conservative Goldwater on Goldwater,The most informative documentary I have scene on Barry Goldwater. I do believe it was done by his granddaughter
5,Exactly what you need,Finally a dictionary that contains literally every word you could ever hope/need to find!! Awesome product.
5,"Be careful, it comes with a wrong enclosure!","I got it correctly, but I was scared because the dictionary has been sent in a ""wrong"" enclosure showing ""Rizzoli-Larousse"" dictionary, whereas inside there's the correct Collins' dictionary!The dictionary is great, exactly as is written here: 900,000 entries, second, new edition.Buy it with confidence."
1,Wish to get the right book,"I'd love to get this dictionary, but like others, twice Amazon sent me the wrong book. Both times I received the Grande Rizzoli Larousse English-Italian dictionary in the HarperCollins Sansoni jacket. I've received a refund from Amazon, but now I'm afraid of ordering from another vendors (B&N, Borders) thinking I'll have the same problem."
1,Can't review the item until I get the Book !!!,"I ordered this book and received the Grand Rizzoli Larousse collegiate (335,000 entries). I tried to exchange that for the Harper Collins unabridged (900,000 entries) and was told to get a refund from Amazon. I did this.I ordered this book again from a different vendor and again received the Grand Rizzoli Larousse collegiate wrapped in the Harper Collins unabridged jacket. I tried to exchange this for the correct book and was sent yet another copy of the Grand Rizzoli Larousse collegiate.I too would love to get this book."
1,Would first like to receive it!,"I ordered the HarperCollins Sansoni Italian Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition, on the carefully evaluated basis of it's description on Amazon, plus positive reviews from friends.What I actually received from Amazon was the Grande Rizzoli Larousse English Italian Dictionary. I made one attempt to reorder the HarperCollins Sansoni, but again received the Rizzoli Larousse, at which point I gave up. Perhaps Amazon could let me know when they find it? I understand it is a good book."
4,You Really Should Kuh-know Wha-Who's Wha-Who,"This British comedy album is as guffaw-producing as it was fifty years ago when I first heard it. Something about British humor. Especially memorable are ""The Gnu Song,"" ""The Reluctant Cannibal,"" and the one near the end about the origin of the song ""Greensleeves,"" or as Flanders pronounces it, ""Greenfleeves."" Okay, the album may be a bit dated, but for those of a certain age it brings back a funnier, gentler time."
3,Language too schlorarly for the average person,"Found the language of the book too scholarly. Example: ""The verbal form expressing Yahweh's actions is characteristically participial; that is, this is not an intrusive eventfulness, but an assured ongoing process that Yahweh does regularly and everywhere."" The entire book is written in this manner.I'm sure the contents are probably excellent but I found this book too difficult to read for the average joe."
3,"Excellent Book, Poor Navigation","I bought this book to read on the iPad, since I already own copy of the print version. I was very disappointed with the navigation. I sure hope that this can be fixed or I might return the electronic version."
3,Fun but I like Q3arena,"I found this a pain in the [rear] to negociate the software in Win2K, both install and play. It can be fun and fast paced, get a Joystick. I also have RocketArena and Quake 3 Arena, ..."
2,"Too little, too late","This *is* just a piecemeal offering from Id for a bolt on other companies have for free, or as a patch. The multiplayer is fast(otherwises known as errors in their skeletal system), and the weapons now have alternate fire modes, which other game companies have had for years using the same engine... odd, that. Correct, this is not a single player game as Id never could get the AI down quite right. But, who plays single player deathmatch? Okay, if you're burned out from Counter Strike and all the other Half Life bolt-ons, get this. Otherwise, go download Counter Strike and have at it."
2,Quake 3 arena,Save your money. All you will get from Quake 3 Arena is a massive headache.The graphics are incredible but the screen action is too quick to enjoy. The game also lacks any sort of a quest.
2,The game Quake 3 should have been.,"I don't care what people think, all this is is an improved Quake 3. This is the game that Quake 3 should have been when it was released a year ago. Instead we were given a half finish, sophomoric menu driven, rehashed game...which was beaten out feature wise by the more polished Unreal Tournament. Now we have to pay AGAIN to get the finished product. I find if funny that the most popular online action game right now it Counterstrike, which is basically just a Half-life mod base on old Quake engine technology, yet it's destroying Quake 3 for players online. I'm glad Quake 3 is dead...because it died a long time ago."
4,Abrupt but thought provoking,"A strange but haunting set of stories that may cause yountonscratch your head at times, but the excellent, concise writing style lures you back o try your luck in the next story. Believable characters, angst, struggles all reveal themselves through situation, character and story."
4,Excellent prerpsective of everyday issues in Nepal,"I found this book of short stories very interesting as it presented various personal scenarios of average Nepali people. Issues such as homosexuality, father-daughter relationships and victimization of terrorism are portrayed. I am a volunteer with Nepalese speaking Bhutanese refugees in Atlanta and this has added as special insight in to their original culture. A good read and one that allows you to easily empathize and vsiualize the characters. Found some of th endings to be unique and open to discussion."
4,A Rich Collection,"I read this collection in one sitting. Samrat's characters read real and true, and not once does the reader doubt this author's grasp on his stories. Fans of Jhumpa Lahiri will love this collection and author; the story ""The Weight of a Gun"" alone makes the collection worthwhile."
5,The Master,"This box set of four CD's is a complete compliment to Marvin Gaye.The first 2cd's are of his earlier works and his duets which include Ain't no mountain high enough etc.His earlier works are quite easy to listen to and I fell that they are really enjoyable.The next two cd's are from the middle and later stages of his life.They include songs from What's going on and Let's get it on which are some of his best work.The booklet included in the package is quite brilliant with all his hits listed in it, his albums and a review from David Ritz.This box set is a must have for fans."
3,Hard to sing to.,I thought that the music was actually off key. I practiced quite a bit and still couldn't get it. It was definitely hard music to sing to.
2,Not As Good As I'd Expected,"Well I consider myself Josefina's biggest fan, having fallen in love with her six-book series, and I enjoy mysteries, so I was really looking forward to reading my favorite character's single installment in this series. But I thought it lacked a lot of the interest of the other AG mysteries. The story switches between a ghostly legend and a search for treasure, both of which plots would have been better on their own but were poorly combined. There were a lot of fortunate coincidences in the plotline, and Josefina essentially followed around while others solved the mystery. She was not proactive like the other heroines, such as Kirsten, and seemed unsure and almost melodramatic, which is out of character. Frankly, I found myself bored and hoping the story would pick up, but it never did. For much younger children this may be an interesting story, but I'm personally hoping Josefina will receive a better mystery soon."
3,"Atlantis, The Lost Continent Finally Found",The book is great but the web references are inoperative and no one responds to emails for help. Not worth the money without the web extensions.
3,"solid thesis, poor book","I have followed the research from prof. Santos already from the beginnings of when he started with his website and I was very much convinced with the arguments he presented in his 'old' website, before he published this book.The book itself is disappointing: numerous repetitions, lack of illustrations, non existing book referenced links on the website, theories proposed but not elaborated (no reference also), emotional statements versus other authors.As much as a was thrilled by the website data to buy this book, as much was I disappointed by the sheer waste of paper on which the researcher could have done a far better job.Unfortunately, the author seems to have passed away a few years ago, may he be happy wherever he is now. I sincerely hope somebody would pick up his research and at least make it accessible to complete this book."
2,A hodgepodge!,"Schizophrenically edited. Derivative of the other Eve Zibart Disney World ""Unofficial Guide"" series. About 3/5ths of this book is interesting and entertaining, but the rest is confusing (Animal Kingdom will be built, is being built, is open, goes back to will be built... all in the course of the same chapter) or mean-spirited. Whoever wrote the ""America's Adventures in Wonderland"" chapter has a chip on their shoulder - they must be the type of person who goes about searching for reasons to feel slighted and insulted. (Hint to the author: Disney World is a theme park, not a state textbook hearing.) Buy this book for the history and trivia, but if you're looking for a guide to Disney World, look elsewhere."
2,Rushed and incomplete,"Don't get this book if you're a Disney nut, because you're going to get a rehash of 99% of what you already know. You're not going to find much in the way of insider secrets or funny antecdotes about Disney or the theme parks. Also, the book has a number of glaring factual errors, once you come across one of them, your faith in the rest of the material isn't going to last long. Skip this one."
2,"Little new, with condescension to boot","I came to the book looking for interesting inside tidbits. What I found was a book not well-researched, with a number of outright factual errors, such as the old urban legend that the top of the castle can be removed in the event of a hurricane.All this is wrapped up in a post-modern smugness that makes the reading experience, while fast-moving, downright unpleasant at times."
1,Outdated and incomplete,This book is of lesser quality than other Disney unofficial guides. Information on resorts is incomplete and antiquated (such as there only being one All-Star resort). I was highly disappointed. I have found better Disney guides and information on the Internet than I did from this book.
2,Holy bad writing Walt!,"This book is filled with so many typos and bad writing, that it is an insult to the professionalism of Walt Disney World. Chapters make no sense as to why they are called what they are called, and topics drift every which way but loose.There are much better books out there that help people realize the magic."
1,DIDNT THINK WAS ALL THAT GOOD AS WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ALITTLE MORE UPDATED, NOT REALLY ALOT OF NEW TECHNICS INVOLVED IN THIS VIDEO"
4,Good looking bookcase,"This is a very good looking bookcase, I put it in the living room for display.I used it for my media collection."
3,Henckel Quality???,"Bought two sets for Christmas. Loved them, until today (mid Feb). Just noticed one of the knives is starting to rust. We have an entire set of Henckels knives purchased in Germany in the late 70's. They are used daily and we wouldn't trade them for any other set of knives, they are beautiful. We noticed the Manor flatware was made for Henckel in China. The set is beautiful, but rust is not acceptable."
5,What a relief !!,"When our 9 yr old garage door opener stopped working, I thought we would have to buy a new one. Did a little research, found this item, followed the instructions provided by others and the garage door is as good as new. The teeth were extremely worn on the old part. The shipping was crazy fast. Very pleased."
4,"Great price, easy to install, works, lacks instructions","Many of the reviewers here seem upset that this part fails. This part is designed to fail. This is a good thing. After having my garage door inspected after the original part failed, we determined the springs were not tight enough, thus making the door too heavy. So, this $15 part failed instead of the screw itself or the $200 opener. I'll take replacing a $15 part any day.This part is easy to install, and the tips in other reviews are very helpful, but this part should come with instructions."
5,Great Service,Product was received quickly and was exactly what I needed. Quick and easy service- would definitely recommend using this company
5,Superb gift and reader,"Have purchased over a dozen of these and handed them out as gifts - so simply written, so deeply focused, you don't even realize you are lovingly being led along the path of a thoughtful life...."
2,Not really good enough,"This is a reasonable light that certainly does a good job of making you visible to motorists. I would agree with the reviewer about brightness - it is not really bright enough to use as the only source of illumination.For me the most disappointing factor is the 'no tools' fitting strap. It grips poorly on glossy surfaces - like many handlebars, for example! I ended up gluing rubber patches to the inside of the strap to improve this.Worse, the strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over a year of use. The pivot pins are just not up to the rest of the build quality.Pros- Good light for sodium lit city streets- Really waterproof- Solid caseCons- The 'no tools' strap simply sucks.- You'll need another light if it is genuinely dark where you ride.Not really worth the investment. I bought a cheaper 5-led light - with a proper screwdriver tightened quick release fixing - that I am far happier with.The CatEye is now an expensive spare flashlight."
3,"Great light, very poor mount",I bought this light for commuting and to be seen. I am pleased how well motorists see me night or day raining or not. I did not expect it to illuminate the road although it does... barely. The light it self is great for it's intended purpose.The mount is really poor. It constantly slips on the handle bar of my road and mt. bike.
2,Don't fall for the hype!,"Don't fall for the hype! It's a foregone conclusion: The Hotel Costes cd series gets progressively worse from one volume to the next. Costes 6 has just two decent tracks. As much as I tried to get into it, Costes 6 just doesn't cut it."
1,Hotel Costes 6 - Disappointing,"I based my purchase of Hotel Costes Vol. 6 on the previous volumes. That was a mistake. Listen to the tracks before you purchase this album. Boring, repetative tracks. Not like previous albums in the series, which I really enjoy. Very tired, filler material. Pompougnac should retire the series after this one! Terrible!"
2,Not even close,"I have every single volume and love them all. However, this one was super disappointed with this last volume that I couldn't wait to receive. The CD Album aesthetics were very tasteful but I also (as another reviewer) fear that the production was more in tune with the appearance of the album rather than its contents and the song sequences do not blend into each other as well as they have in past albums. I however DO NOT recommend this album, unless you want it as part of your collection because you have all the other volumes. I only liked 2 songs on here. The rest was not as sophisticated as in past volumes."
4,Mediocre in its series,"Stephane has done a good mix. This album does not touch me as much as his previous Costes (1,2,3 and 4) and that's why I give it 4 stars. But the album by itself is definitely 5 stars. All lounge tracks are good especially the tracks by Slow Train, Minus 8 and Spiro Projecto. The album also includes 2 folded posters of a model for your viewing pleasure. If you are looking for a cool mellow mix to go with that gin and tonic, I guarantee this will satisfy your needs."
5,The best lounge in town,"For sure, this is the best of Costes series. If you (ever) had to make a hard decision, buy this one (then all the rest) !!!"
1,It sucks.,"Three and four are great in my opinion. I play them over and over.But six is terrible. I had to give it away so I wouldn't be reminded ofit. Very disappointing. I have not heard any others besides 3,4,and 6 so far.Too bad you can't return cd's."
5,"It grows on you, like festering mold.","This album has three of Boingo's best songs, ""Insects"", ""Private Life"" and ""Islands,"" and for those three alone it should be worshipped. There's a little less of the Mystic Knights here than on Only a Lad (the nods to music from the past are less frequent), but it's nearly as addictive and actually touching at times. (""Islands"" is such a sad and personal song for early Boingo!) You gotta get it."
4,A blast from the past for cheap!,"I bought this for the unbelievably low price of $6.98...only to now find it for $5.99. Six measly bucks for one great album. If you don't jump on this, consider yourself brain-dead.Now, that out of the way, it's not all wonderful. Reptiles and Samurai gets on my nerves. Same with Insects. But, the rest of the CD is quite enjoyable.One of my fondest memories is relaxing to Whole Day Off when I was a wee-lad of 16. And who could resist the adrenaline rush of the title track? Same with Wild Sex, Private Life, and the rest of the album.So, spend the six bucks, you cheap-skate. You won't be disappointed (and if you are, it's only six bucks)."
5,Excellent OB,"While ""Nothing To Fear"" has some of OB's most popular concert songs (like the title track), I prefer its B-sides like ""Whole Day Off"", ""Why'd We Come"", and ""Running On A Treadmill"". These songs show some of the bands most creative work.This is an excellent CD, representing the L.A. New Wave Scene during its peak. OB was able to mix their ska-punk influences with enough synth pop to make this one a classic."
3,Clear cut descriptions about the terror that prevailed in 37,"This book analyses the mode of governance of Joseph Stalin. The bureaucracy seems to have been the abode of obscurantists.Full credit to the author,as he was successful in empathizing with the unfotunate Russians of those times."
4,Cute and sturdy,"I've had this item for a while and looks good, keeps its shape, doesn't get dirty and it is pretty sturdy. It fits the essentials for the day."
2,not impressed,"i'm not a fan of the ""chitlin circuit"" plays, it was an unintentional purchase and i was affirmed in my dislike. however, if you are not as picky, you may find it entertaining."
5,Lover of Friends and Lovers,I really enjoyed this play. I have not stop watching it since I purchased it. The play had all the qualities I look for in a well developed production. The acting was great as well as the very funny comedy and the superb singing. The production of the play was of the highest quality and I strongly recommend purchasing this dvd. I am looking forward to purchasing more African American plays with the same degree of excellence as this one.
3,Pretty Good,"I read the book that this stage play is based on in about 48 hours it was so good, the play wasn't quite as exciting but still good. Leon, as usual plays his role flawlessly. I'd recommend this one if you are into stage plays."
2,Friends & Lovers,"I really didn't like this play I thought I was purchasing a movie. The characters are good, I like them in other movies, I just didn't like the play format."
3,the book was better,"i feel they could've found better people to be in this play. to me they all sounded like they were reading right from the script, and it wasn't that funny. there were parts that Leon's character was screaming his lines, but it didn't make sense. it was ok, but could've been better."
5,"Informative, fascinating, entertaining","I was born into the park service and lived the tourist experience. This book really helped me form a perspective about my early years growing up in western tourist and resort environments. Western history is fascinating, but this angle on western history really gives another intriguing dimension to america's perception of the mythic frontier."
5,Found SD memory card,"I got this bag for my wife's Nikon D80. She is pleased with the bag which is good from a review point of view. However, she held up a memory card and asked if I placed it in the bag.So our ""new"" bag has someone else's memory card and it is indeed full of pictures. Looks like New York scenes mostly around xmas time. The dates on the files say December 2009 thru January 17 2010. If you would like to claim this card - please respond to this review and tell me the brand name of the camera to help prove this is your memory card."
5,My standard carry bag,"I have three of these, for my Nikon SLR's they work fine. The D700 and a 28-300mm lens fit's perfect, a D50 and an 18-55mm fits a little loose but the internal spacers can be adjusted to fit. There's a small pouch in the top flap for memory cards, and the top pocket is just big enough for either a battery and charger or extra filters. For a day trip or just a small package to carry it's just about right. The zippers are nylon and have held up to over two years of use, and the bag is reasonably weatherproof--I've been able to take it through snow and light rain without a problem. I'm a little mystified about why it has two additional D rings on it, which I assume are for additional straps to carry it like a backpack. The only thing I'd like to have seen extra on this bag is maybe a label window for those of us who own multiple cameras."
4,not ready for pro dslrs,"great bag, lives up to lowepro's rep but simply too small for a d300 w/grip. the camera with no grip and a 30mm prime just barely fit. no way would it take a longer zoom. adding insult to injury, no room for a flash in the acc. pocket. mine is going back. would be a great solution for someone with a smaller camera, though."
4,Measure you lens first,"Make sure your lens is under 5.5"" otherwise there might be a good chance that it won't fit.Other than that it is an excellent bag."
3,OK bag for camera with lens,"After reading the reviews, I thought this bag would be bigger than it actually is. It really only has room for the camera with attached lens and a pocket for a few extras such as filters or cards. I would prefer a bag that can hold an extra lens, but the conical shape prevents that."
2,"Nice idea, bad shape.","The shape of this bag prevents it from being a really good camera bag. With a camera and attached lens inside, there is more room than the camera needs-- but not enough room to store anything else in the main pocket. The design of the front pocket won't let the zipper close with anything larger than a battery in it. If only the bottom of the bag was wider, or the top of the bag was narrower, and the front pocket had a little more fabric at the top, this would be the perfect little camera bag. Alas. I gave up trying to make it ""work"" and returned mine."
4,Nice Lil' Bag,Strong...Samll...and a few pockets....nice.I have a Nikon D200 and 18-200mm lensThe bag works great
5,I would (and have) order these again.,These Jewell cases are as good as any I have bought. In fact the center tab (ring) seems to hold the Disc more secure than many others I have purchased in the past. This is important for me since I travel a lot with a collection of DVD copies and I don't want them rattling loose and getting damaged. If you order 2 boxes (200 total cases) they are shipped in a very secure and tight fitting box and arrived for me the first order without any damage. I just ordered 200 more. The price and quality are good.
2,Broken Game,So I got this game and guess what I could not get it going looks like they terminated the whole server and the site to where you could not play it anymore. So each time I tried to play the game it said the site had been terminated so O well.
1,A Poor Game- Activision at its Worst,"Aside from the fact that the game is painfully complex and boring, the thing that got me the most is that after you spend money to buy the game-- you have to spend MORE money to actually win against opponants. It's like buying a car, and then having to pay extra for the keys, it's simple exploitation. Activision ought to be ashamed of itself."
1,DO NOT BUY - YOU CANNOT PLAY,"Just to be clear, this WAS an online game.As part of the online game, it also required secure trading with other players. That means it requires secure servers to be run by the company so that players have a way to interact.Those servers no longer exist. This game cannot be played and does not have an option to bypass the missing company servers.This game should no longer even be sold, its only value is as a dust collector or if you really like the picture on the box cover. Save your money and go buy a poster of Q if that is what you want.And for the record, even back when the game could be played, it sucked horribly and was not worth your time."
1,Terrible Game,"I highly suspect all of the 5 Star reviewers here are plants...For one, they all say they love playing this game ""After Homework"" and use certain words in all caps.Another reason you can suspect they aren't real people is because they think this game deserves 5 stars.This game is terrible, horrible, and above all, expensive. Don't buy into the system, simply play something better.If you absolutely want to play a tactics game online, try Tactics Arena Online or Final Fantasy Tactics Realms (which are mostly free), or Sanctum (which is not free), or chess or poker or something else besides this game."
3,Felt weird,"This shoe looked good, but didn't feel right when wearing it. It was a bit too long and wide."
2,MY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH MY NEW SYNERGY FLATWARE,I recently purchased and received as a gift Synergy flatware. I love how they look--very classy! But the knives look awful--they rust. They have brown rusty spots all over them. I am embarressed to use my new flatware when I have company. The flatware feels great in your hand and looks beautiful on the table--but only after you take the time to get the rust spots off each knife. What a disappointment!! My old Oneida looks better than my new flatware!!
1,Rusty Dansk Knives,"The knives rust in the dishwasher. It starts as small spots, then opens up into a full-on, brown crusty rust on the blade of the knives. Apparently, 18/10 Stainless Steel has a different meaning to the Danish, or perhaps their Chinese manufacturer."
2,JavaScript Source(of Madness)book,"This book would have been nice to keep on my bookshelf. But, at the very beginning I could see the inconsistencies of the programming examples. It drove me mad. So, I had to return it."
3,Good in many ways but confusing in others,"This is the first and only book I've read on JavaScript. Though I have some programming experience I knew little about object oriented programming. I thought the explaination was good and the book in well organized - chapters on objects, properties, methods and functions, etc. My complaint is this: there is some confusing stuff here. Programming elements are used in examples before they are explained. Though some of this is necessary, he could have used simpler examples in many places. Also, he used different ways to call functions in the examples. For example, to call a function from a mouse event, he used no arguments one time and used arguments in another example. Both ways work, but it confused me. It is a pretty good reference book. Following the table of contents most instructions are listed alphabetically with page numbers. The explainations are in sections with the program elements in easy to spot bold type."
2,"A gifted programmer/author, he leaves too many blanks spots.","This book has many pages and examples but, sadly, very few are complete with details. Author uses a subjective style which, and he says it is his intent, that provides few/no comments on coding of intricate details of a highly technical subject. Few screen displays are given of the outcome of gobs of incomplete code. I am still searching for a very good JavaScript reference and know that the Official Netscape JavaScript Book only rated a 4. Newsgroup says JavaScript Bible by D. Goodman is a 9 but can not locate it.Euphemisms of ""secret sauce"" and ""know the secret"", egads. This book had great spurts but needed additional inputs."
2,Buggy examples,"The source code has lots of bugs, and generally uses mediocre software engineering practices.The provided CD examples (when zipped) would fit on a 1.44 floppy, so don't get your hopes up that there are lots of examples."
2,Get the Netscape ONE Developers Guide Instead!,"I thought this book was too vague and too inconsistent. Beyond this the book didn't cover the advanced issues I needed to learn. Lucky for me I found a great JavaScript reference in a rather unlikely place, William Stanek's Netscape ONE Developers Guide, which covers JavaScript 1.2, server-side JavaScript (LiveWire), plug-in programming and much more in great detail. Try THAT book...You won't be disappointed. Gre"
3,Optional antenna,Product works as advertised. Actual antenna only provided small coverage. Had to purchase an additional air station for coverage I needed. This adapter works fine. The antenna is suspect.
5,Ben Cummings ROCKS!,"I love EVERYTHING Ben Cummings releases. I have been with his organization since 1996 and he has never disappointed me. Just when I think I've heard and seen it all, Ben releases seven brand new strategies to grow my chiropractic practice in this crazy economy. The word ""cutting edge"" simply does not describe his material because everything he recommends is the ""next big thing""!"
5,Delivers the goods,Ben Cummings is a chiropractic marketing genus! The info provided on this DVD is enough to jumpstart and sustain any practice in any town.
5,A Superbly Detailed Work,"Bar none, the best resource for growing your practice. The information is presented in a fully comprehensible and entertaining fashion. This guy knows what he's doing. Well done. Fully recommended."
1,awful service,I am extremely upset with this buyer. I ordered and paid for the book over a month ago and still have not recieved it. I emailed the buyer over two weeks ago and have still not gotten a response. I would not recommend bying from this person.
4,good article about this group in the London Times,"I am buying this album because of the excellent article about the choir in the London Sunday times, July 20, 2003. the article says that they are the real deal. hope it is true, since I love gospel music."
1,too foxy for me.....,"yes, I know fox hunting was legal and accepted in Regency England. But, that being said, I really don't want to read a Romance predominantly about two avid fox hunters. On top of that, the author goes into more depth about the horses relationships than the human ones. Honestly, by about page 75 of 375 pages, there had been twice as much horseflesh discussion than anything else. Too involved in that subject for a Historical Romance. It just made the book boring with a capital B. My suggestion-ride off into the sunset before buying this book.1 star."
4,Great for our four year old granddaughter,This is a wonderful way to use fantasy and dreams to reinforce saving money.
4,item works as it should,"very bright lights, keep you safer while driving at night fo sho. now just need the ones that turn when you turn so you can see ahead into dark turns"
4,"Wit, warmth, and wisdom","A marriage based on a secret does not bode well for longevity, but this one lasted long enough for Joan, the wife of a successful writer and her former married, creative-writing professor, to sit back in her first-class airline seat and take a good long look at just what she traded for when she married the man.This diabolically funny and wicked book is a rant of sorts against the literary establishment, gender, status, and fame. Excellent summer read - also excellent for autumn, winter, and spring reading, as well."
3,Quit Whining and Change Your Life,"The husband and wife ""team"" in this little novel so epitomize all that I despise that I could never quite get past my negative feelings to praise the author's occasional insight or well-turned phrase. Long-suffering characters---and people---get on my nerves. This long-suffering wife whines throughout the novel, mainly because of her husband, whom she has finally screwed up her courage to leave. And certainly she has ample reasons to leave her totally self-serving pig of an author/husband. Her final reason to leave him, which is revealed near the end of the story, comes as they travel to Finland together to receive his crowning literary award. Instead of helping to gain the reader's sympathy, however, the revelation confirms the wife's own weakness, and makes me shout: You stupid cow. How could you have waited all this time to change your life?"
2,Took too long to get interesting,"I kept at this book, hoping it would get better, and more interesting -- after all, it's certainly not a THICK book. I think the only reason I didn't put it down is because I kept viewing the professor as a professor I briefly dated in college -- and that alone made me root for her and the way she ended it all!"
2,Stupid Women Stupid Choices,"If you don't see the ""twist"" coming at the end of Wolitzer's ""The Wife"", then you've never read any feminist literature before...heck, you haven't ever read a mystery, either!Add this novel to the stack of books (most recently ""Mrs. Kimbal"" by Jennifer Haigh) about women making incomprehensible life choices.Are we really this stupid or do we just like to read about women who are and feel superior?"
1,Mean spirited with a capital MEAN!,"Now that I'm finished with THE WIFE, I find myself wondering what made the narrator's voice so throughly, unremittingly off-putting. The answer, I think, is that when not filled with a kind of self-congratulatory contempt for the ego of successful writers, (and, by the way, this book is all about how writers crave fame and not at all about many writiers, male and female, who write because they need to write), it reeks with contempt and scorn for unsuccessful writers. And the wives of writers. And the narrator's own troubled children. In fact, everyone.The voice here is so cynical, so knowing, so obsessed with reputation, that I found it unbearable. I'm not a writer so maybe I'm naive about this, but I don't buy that even in the muscular era of Norman Mailer,Philip Roth etc., all writers cared about were prizes and sales and...other people's wives."
3,"the oprah crown will love ""Wife"".","its not that it wasnt well written but rather I was disappointed at the way the main character chose to be in her life choices. ""She"" disappointed me. Initially it was compelling, or she was I should say, but she began to get irritating to me. It seems like this one will be a huge hit with the Oprah crowd, I just dont happen to fall into that category. If you want something with a little more ""bite"" to it, try ""Thw Womans Room"" bu marilyn french. I liked those characters better. I would love to read more by meg wolitzer but I want to see her characters in a little differant light. more gimption to them, if you would. keep plugginh Meg, youre talented, I just didnt care for the characters, but I like your wit!"
3,poorly timed heart attack,The character development is compelling and the issues confronted are challenging. I am dumbfounded at the decision to make a cheap Hollywood ending for this woman faced with answering the crucial question of do you negate your own self-worth to support your man/your marriage.
3,Consider the era this woman grew up in,"When I finished this book, I decided I didn't like it because the main character stayed married for too long and I didn't like the character for not having the gumption to leave earlier though she wasn't happy. I feel that way about my parents who are in their mid-60's and feel ""stuck"", but then I remembered that the author clearly points out that this couple was met in the late 1950's when the choices for women were far fewer than today which lends some credence to the length of their marriage. The author has a very interesting story to tell, bt her language is not very challenging. The surprsie at the end of the book is NO surprise at all. I like a book with a little more suspense, and a little crisper language."
2,A disappointment,"Usually I enjoy Wolitzer's books but this one annoyed me, particularly since the ""twist"" at the end wasn't surprising. I'm not giving anything away by noting that Joan Castleman, the narrator of this story, decides to leave her husband - this detail is revealed in the first chapter of the book, very early on. From there, she goes back and forth between describing the past (how she met her husband, his literary career, etc) and the present. It is the ending that seems so unbelievable to me and a throwback to earlier types of fiction, where women sacrifice themselves for love. A tale of two deeply dysfunctional people, in a marriage that lasted far too long, not particularly enlightening or engaging to read about."
2,Just another peeved off wife!,"So like many books, this is just another peeved off wife and their lacking, boring relationship where everything is the man's fault etc etc. The ending left me saying, ""That's it?!?!"". I hope to try another book from the author and have a better review."
5,wonderful and engrossing!!!!,This was a terrific book that I couldn't put down. It taugt me a lot about women and men and marriage and betrayal. Really fun and sooo smart.
4,"A case of ""Just Desserts"" ... or is that ""Just Deserts""?","I don't know this author and only bought this book because it was so very well reviewed in the Washington Post and New York Times book reviews. I have to admit, the subject matter sounded kind of interesting: the wife of a famous author who, on the eve of his greatest triumph, decides she is going to leave him. She builds the case very carefully for us and it is important that she do so because we might be inclined to think she's just a sad, aging whiner. But she manages to bring us along with her and we even understand why she stayed with this man for so many years, even as we understand why she has to leave. But do we really? We think we do...until the story is almost over."
3,"Clever with a ""K"".","While I finished this book in 3 days - and looked forward to reading it every night - I ultimately found it to be mediocre in writing and plot. I found the writing a little too cutesie and clever - like the writer was smug and proud as she wrote. Some of her 'crafty' descriptions didn't even make sense. The beginning of the relationship between the two was exciting and intriguing, but as they became man and wife and plodded through life, it became mundane. Mrs. Castleman's musings on being a WIFE felt sophomoric, and then the big twist at the end felt like the plot twist a remedial writer would construe. This book wasn't terrible, I just had higher hopes for it."
2,A brief comment on a brief history of time,This video should have rather been called a brief biography of Stephen Hawking. It only touched very lightly on his theories and works. I thought it would be a video version of his famous book but the video can not compare to the book at all. There are many interviews with people but one has no idea who these people are or what their relationship is to Dr Hawking as there are no subtitles. I suggest viewers first view the credits at the end of the movie where a list of interviewees is given and then go back and watch the film. The video is also dissappointingly short lasting only for 80 minutes.
5,An inspiring and educational story,An interesting story of the technical side of astrophysics combined Stephen Hawkings' personal story. You can tell that his mind powers his body rather than vice versa as most of the rest of the human race. I find him admirable and inspiring in the face of extreme adversity.
3,Fair,"If you are looking for information on theories than go read the book, this is a review of hawkings life. It is good in that regard but has nothing on science."
2,"Should be titled ""A Brief History of Stephen Hawkings' Life""","Hawkings is an amazing guy and this is a good biography. However, if you're craving lots of good science, you'll be disappointed with this amalgam of anecdotes about his health from Stephen's mother."
2,An anything but brief history,"This video was purchased as part of the required material for a college course. I've always been interested in science and the people at the cutting edge, but this autobiographical account of Mr. Hawkings path through life tended to drag. There were even moments when I almost became convinced that we'd been dragged to the event horizon of one of the black holes he is so famous for working with. There are some moments of interest that can draw your attention, but they are few and far between. Unless you are into biographical videos, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this one."
2,Won't stick,"The gasket was cut to the right lengths and would have worked if the gasket would have stuck to the timing cover. I cleaned the covers, peeled the white strip off the gasket and attempted to coerce it to adhere to the timing cover. The adhesive was either too old or otherwise compromised and I could not get it to stick at all.I wasn't able to use this product as intended and would not purchase it again."
5,Best Book On Loss of A Child,"My daughter died at birth one year ago. I tried many books over the past year and this book is the best one I've read on trying to make it past this loss. For any parent struggling to move forward after losing a baby, I can not more highly recommend this book."
4,Beautiful NOT clinical,"This is a beautiful book of prose and suggestions regarding the loss of unborn children. It should, however, be titled ""...: Surviving the Loss of AN UNBORN Child, Words and Poetry to Calm a Broken Heart."" Though the artwork and prose evidence Ms. Brady's talents in art technology and advertising, this book is not for one who is looking for clinical assistance in overcoming the death of a child. I was hoping for more clinical details describing the stages a parent might go through in dealing with the death of a child, and how medical and social professionals could assist them through this extraordinarily difficult period. HOWEVER, I HAD to give the book at least four stars because it is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, and the writing is spectacular. I would definitely recommend it as a purchase to give to a friend or family member who has lost a young or unborn child."
5,There are Angels Among us!,"KYMBERLI, YOUR BOOK OF YOUR LITTELE ANGELS HAS TOUCHED MY SOUL IN A PROFOUND WAY THAT ONLY SOMEONE THAT IS A SPITIRTUAL MALE COULD UNDERSTAND, LOSS OF ANYONE, OF YOUR LIFE FROM CONCEPTION TO BIRTH ALWAYS TOUCHES YOUR SOUL.

TO YOU MY FRIEND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE, THE BEST AUTHOR I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF READING AND MEETING......GOOD BLESS ALL OUR ANGELS FOREVER AND EVER AMEN.....XOXOXO Scottie"
4,Good experience,"Fairly easy to install, might need to chip away some of the mortar of your foundation w/a hammer and chisel. May also need to back the screws out all the way to make extra space to install. They have a 2 yr. garentee but make sure you keep all the paperwork and reciepts."
1,Title deceiving,"This book is not a detailed guide to the Cyclades islands as one might expect. I bought this book thinking it would have loads of information on the island of Santorini but was very disappointed to find only 10 pages or so devoted to the island.In fact the book's title is totally in appropriate. Half the book is devoted to Athens (what's that got to do with Cyclades!) and a quarter to General Info on Greece (History, language etc.) leaving only a quarter to islands coverage (hence the brief descriptions).A waste of money!"
4,easy to install,replaced previous door and was pretty easy to install. fit well. old door was worn and was not holding a good seal but the replacement we are seeing an improvement already. Have 2 dogs that go in and out constantly and its heavy enough to last for several years.
4,petsafe replacement flap,yes it is a replacement.not as simple to install as indicatedon box.expensive but one has no choiceif you want fido to go in and out.
5,Perfect fit!,I just received the replacement flap and installed it. It fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes! Ready for winter!
3,It's not an exact match...,This was definately cheaper than a new door insert. This is the correct door flap replacement; however it doesn't fit as snug as it should.
4,Well make pet door,"It fits well, but it's just a little bit shorter than the original, so there's a small air gap. Otherwise it's great"
3,A bit overpriced,Bought this to replace a 7-year old flap. It is working well but I found it a bit overpriced. Hope it lasts another 7 years.
4,"Replacement flap is abit too wide for my pet door (I have a sliding door insert), but it is an improvement over the original.","As stated above, this replacement flap is abit too wide for my pet door (I have a sliding door insert), but it is an improvement over the original - which warped for some reason. If it had been a perfect fit, it would have gotten a 5-star rating."
3,Ok but did not fit my door,"Pretty pricy for a piece of plastic! Each web site had a slightly different size listed for this model # of door flap & even within the same ad there were several discrepancies in the measurements. After measuring my door numerous times (even removing the door to make sure I had accurate numbers) I felt this was the correct flap. Mine did not have the brand name on it but after reviewing the sizes available for sale I was sure this had to be the one. It fit well except it was 1/4'"" short. If you run into this problem you might try what I did, which was to remove the bottom rail, drill new screw holes "" up & reattach the bottom rail to meet the bottom edge of the flap. Otherwise it is the same quality of an original ""Petsafe"" flap which seems to last about 3-4 years. I currently have installed in my home one ""petsafe"" model for a sliding patio door & 2 other generic doggie doors. All flaps seem to warp leak or tear after about 3-4 years."
2,a necessary evil,"This is the third replacement flap I have purchased: I have a south facing yard and a screen door with the large door flap which allows my dog + cat access to the yard while I am away from home.The product does work as it should, but the life span is aprrox. 2 years only! Despite regular cleaning with warm soapy water (your pet's wet nose will dirty up the flap)the product will eventually develop a warp from the sun's heat/UV ray which leads to air leaking in/out of the house: ie cold in the winter and hot in the summer. If the patio furniture manufacturers and auto makers can figure out a way to make their plastic parts last year after year, WHY NOT this company?Planned obsolescence?!?This is a wonderful product I wish I could love - stock up????"
2,Sorry I bought it.,"First one arrived and it was deformed along the edge. Amazon took care of with no problem in a timely manner. When the replacement one arrived I installed it and although it appears to be the same quality, it does not seal as well as the original. Maybe the magnets aren't as strong or maybe it is just a little shorter.........but the slightest puff of wind now blows the door open. I am sorry that I threw the original out with the trash, because even with a slight tear in it it did a better job than either of the ones I received."
2,Size problems...,"Beware that there are two slightly different sizes and designs available. This is apparently the right type and is nearly the right width for my older doors, but is either a bit too short or the magnets are too weak to pick up the movable bar at the bottom. I have taped the bar in the up position to compensate. If you want a decent air seal, consider replacing the entire unit rather than just the flap."
5,The only place I could find this!,"The dog door this flap is used in has been installed in a wall for over 20 years. This is the third replacement flap installed; the last one was quite worn our, dirty, and in need of replacement.A few minutes of research on line, along with a bunch of running around town (to no avail) to get a replacement, led me to this.As long as they keep making these old-style dog door flaps, folks like me will be replacing them every few years."
5,Classic door,Very easy to replace in about 15 min. Just needed A phillips head screw driver and some caulking for around the edges.
3,dog door replacement plastic,"I had to improvise a little. The replacement would not slide into place but needed the existing screws which worked but I had to trim off the upper edge. Then it was just a little too wide so that required about 1/4 inch of trimming as well. However, the door is now working fine."
5,Replacement Flap is a value,My dogs love their 'doggie' door. I have three panel for them to go through to cut down on the wind and cold coming in. The dog door is a great convience and give the dogs freedom to come and go as they like. I suggest a dog door for any one with dogs. It can be closed to keep the dogs in or out depending on what is going on.
3,Large Replacement Flap,"I have to replace this flap every 4 years due to extreme shinkage. When new, it fits securely on warm days but shrinks in cold weather and the magnet does not hold, therefore letting in the cold air."
2,Not Perfect,"The flap was easy to install and worked fine, except I have a young dog and he still likes to chew and the flap was in pieces after only a couple of days. I'm not sure what, if anything can be done to solve this problem."
3,gaps and wind trouble,"We purchased the replacement flap, because our old one had warped from extended use, and was no longer making contact with the sides of the frame. This was allowing heat & air to escape, and rain/snow to enter. The new flap isn't as sturdy as before. The magnets are weak, so every time there is a decent gust of wind, the flap opens wide, allowing heat/cold/rain/snow to blow straight in to the house! Kind of defeats the purpose of replacing the old flap."
4,"with two dogs, this is holding up very well",We have two dogs who are in and out through this dog door all day long. It is definitely tough enough to withstand this activity. We are very happy with it.
4,Too many Amazon Ad Errors for us!,"Products does not look like the required Classic Petsafe extra large dog door. The expected box at the lower inside left is not visible in the photo. The upper attachment area design looks different. There is also no product number, and the expected ""classic"" description has been omitted. Lastly, door's dimensions that are shown are illogical. Until Amazon gets its act together, It's worth the extra $10 + postage to purchase what we need directly from Petsafe.netA great product, that has lasted the lives of seven of our large dogs. More importantly, our beloved large dogs no longer have to come to us to get in and out. No more scratching-pawing the doors, or barking.[...]"
3,not the actual replacement flap for old models,The size is exactly the same as the flaps held on by 4 screws on top. But you can modify it and it will work. pain in the ass tho.
3,NOT THE BEST,its ok but they only last about a year then they start to tear on top and they are pricey to replace
3,Mistaken purchase,"I am sure this is a wonderful product if I had the door that it fits. However I purchased this thinking I had purchased the complete door. Since I didn't, I am unable to use it. I have subsequently purchased a different door. I am keeping the flap because I may find a use for it and it's not worth the trouble of returning it. I have no complaints; the mistake was mine.Darby Dahl"
4,Wish I would have read that it's ONLY ONE FLAP!,The thing fits perfectly and I have no problem with the product BUT I wish I would have seen that it is a single piece... mer. Kind of crazy that only one flap costs this much! The whole system for a wall dog door is $120
2,"Too Short for ""Pet Smart"" Brand Flap Replacement","About 3/16"" too short as replacement for my Pet Smart patio pet door. With skill you can trim off the bottom 1/2 of the placement tabs and it will be a fair, but not perfect fit. The measurements given were accurate, but in belief of other review adn websites claiming ""never mind the dimensions--it will work in Pet Smart door also"" I bought one. Shipping was almost instantaneous."
3,The dog likes it so it must be OK.,"Just a doggy door - no big deal. Getting a replacement is a lot cheaper than buying the whole thing. Was easy to install, and it does fit. Looks like it will last unless the dog eats it for lunch. Only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of five... Way too expensive. Let's face it. It's a doggy door not the entrance to the Taj Mahal. If you are tired of the wind and snow blowing in your garage, then I would recommend this replacement."
2,replacement dog door,It was not the right one but we customized it to fit too much trouble to send back and would have cost way to much.
5,Exactly What I needed,After several searches I finally came across the correct product. Exactly what I needed as my dog ruined the original flag. Much less expensive here than most places. Thanks Amazon!!
4,I wish it had stronger magnets,"Overall I'm happy with the flap. It's pretty much just like the original that wore out after several years use. My only complaint is that if there's very much wind the magnets aren't strong enough to hold the flap closed, no different from the original. I improved it by buying some super strong magnets online and with some very careful knife work to the flap replaced the originals. It's now more resistant to blowing open. For me the trick will be to remember to save the magnets when the day comes years from now to replace the flap again."
5,It's a very good replacement flap.,"The replacement flaps for the Petsafe doors are expensive. This was the best price I found. If you are perplexed about which flap you need, you can send a picture to the company and they will tell you which one to buy."
5,Quick Service and Exactly what we needed,Purchased these replacement flaps from the Amazon Warehouse deals (less than perfect package). They arrive quickly and were brand new. One package was perfect the other has a slight tear in the cardboard. No big deal as we were just going to throw away the packaging after opening the product.
5,Heavy and Good Quality,This is not the cheapest lamp out there but if you are considering purchasing you should not worry about getting a quality lamp! The wood finish is beautiful and when you hold the lamp you can tell its of high quality ... I love how it has some good weight to it as well!**NOTE** I was caught not paying attention and purchased the desk lamp instead of the floor lamp! Luckily I have decided I will end up buying both so it won't matter but you will notice that although the picture shows a floor lamp there are two types for sale ... the floor and the desk... read carefully and make sure you are getting the one you want... don't just follow the picture!
2,TOO Small - Even for someone who wanted a really small bag,"I have a Nikon D300, 16-85 for my glass, and an SB-600 flash. This bag cannot hold all three of these items without the bag bulging out into my spine. It is also very difficult to get my gear out of the bag, which makes me want to take less pictures, which is a VERY bad thing. That is the ultimate reason why I gave it two stars, and why I was thinking of only giving it one star. What is the reason for schlepping a camera and accessories around if you are never going to take them out of the bag? I was disappointed, since I have only ever purchased Lowepro camera bags. If you are a serious dSLR user, I would pass. If you have one of those not-quite-a dSLR but bigger than a Canon PowerShot ELPH cameras, then maybe perhaps possibly this bag could potentially work for you. I wish I could ship mine back."
1,Excellent Camera Bag,The bag is quite roomy and very well made. The balance is excellent so that the weight is well distributed. I like it very much.
5,Lowepro Micro Trekker 100 Camera Bag,This is a wonderful camera bag. It is light with room enough to carry an SLR a couple of lens and also most camera accessories. I love it!!!
4,Perfect size,Holds all my equipment and is very compact. I'm a beginner photographer and really like this bag ... holds all my stuff. I went on a 10 mile hike and this bag was perfect.
5,"If you want this , go for it ...","Little smaller than Lowepro 200 (which is $15-$20 more than this) but easily accomodate a SLR kit. I've packed following in my Lowepro 100 :- Canon 10D body with 17-40mm f/4 L lens attached- Canon 420EX Flash- Canon 55-200mm USM lens- Canon 50mm f/1.8 prime lens- Some more small stuffs like Omini bounce , chargerApart from this you could keep all you flash cards , wires in the front zip.Sorry but you can't accomodate any more stuffs in the bag. If you have more lenses or body then you should go for Lowepro 200. But I belive most of the ametures use to have a body + 2lenses+ Flash. This bag should be perfect for that.High quality materials.Cons : So far I've not found anything"
5,Great camera bag,"This is a great bag. I took it on our Alaska trip. I put my Canon Rebel in it along with my 200 zoom lense, teleconverter, compact camera, filters, extra batteries in the zippers, lens cleaning pen and 20 rolls of film in the front zipper. I even had room for my wallet. It worked great. We even had rain and snow and it stayed dry. My plan was to put it in my regular backpack but I decided that was to big to carry around all the time so I went with just this bag. If you are planning on putting a lot of other stuff in it then get the bigger one, but for the hobby photographer it works just fine."
3,I didn't use it.,It came with other products and was cracked in the shipment. I didn't bother with a return as it would be more hassle than it is worth.
5,A Masterpiece,"This album is awesome. It has all of Astral Projection's best tracks like Powergen, Mahadeva, Liquid Sun. I really like the way the tracks flow into one another ( yes I am aware this is a ""DJ"" album) but it makes it so much more unified and interesting. This is one of the few albums I listen to over and over again and never tire of, these guys kick ass and they make it seem so easy. Highly reccomended. Only down side for me is the Cass and Slide remix of Liquid Sun which just doesn't do it for me, but the original mix is on disc two, so I cant begrudge them that. I thought the naming of each disc Sundown and Sunrise was pretty cool too."
5,Can listen to it again and again and again and again....,"This is one of those trance mixes I can just listen to while I drive, and when it's over, start it up again. It is just simply, YUM."
4,James R. Elliot,James R. Elliot please contact me . I wll be more than happy to take this cd off your hands for the price of shipping! ....
4,A Decent Collection...,"This is a decent collection of articles on a relatively important topic. However, instead of the inclusion of some articles, which seem to be extraneous and not very helpful in comprehending Kantian-styled TA's, the text should include Stroud's classic article (1968), his 'modest' approach in ""The Goal of TA's...""(included in Stern), and his article on ""kantian Invulnerability...."" For Stroud's articles, see his anthology Understanding Human Knowledge (Oxford UP). I also recommend looking up A. Brueckner's articles (TA 1, TA 2, etc...), which should have been included in Stern's anthology.I also recommend reading over Strawson's Individuals, yet again."
3,Excellent camera bag,"I have a Canon 20D w/28-300mm zoom lens, plus I carry a 50mm prime lens, plus necessary cleaning cloths, etc. I also was able to carry an extra battery, and sun glasses in this bag. We took a Mediterranean Cruise touring multiple countries. I utilized the waist strap as well as shoulder strap as security from being stolen. The weight of the camera and lens was almost non-noticeable when using the case, even though we walked for miles everyday. Absolutely excellent! The bag features a wide waist support straps and can easily make it around a large person (I am 250), and the shoulder strap is also excellent. If you are looking for a relatively small case with a good capacity, that is secure then get this one."
4,My First How To Speak Japanese Book,"I never did take a foreign language class in school b/c I never found spanish language to me. But once I purchase this book, I caught on very quick. I also purchase this to better understand the anime I also love to watch. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,Quite good,This was the first book I used to learn Japanese. The extensively illustrated text has exercises on nearly every page. It gave me a good grasp of the basic fundamentals IN ROMAJI. I disagree with those students that say you must learn the Kana at the same time. I started with Japanese in 10 Minutes a Day and learned lots of words and very basic sentence stricture. I still use the flash cards and the stickers are still up all over my house (no they haven't left any marks even on wood). Now I'm working with more advanced books and learning to read Japanese in Japanese writing. I don't think I could have done that without knowing some of the words first.The best part about this book was that I felt that I was making progress every day.
2,ugh tourist,this book was my first look at nihongo.. its tourist level.. if you want to be fluent dont waste your time with this.. if you are going on a vacation by all means buy this book.. well this book is not worth the 20$ i paid for it.. the stickers were pretty helpful in the beginning.. its only got romaji.. no kana.. and definitely no kanji.. you cant go to japan for any length of time without encountering kanji and kana.. if you dont know at least the kana its unlikely you will be able to live in japan comfortably and be able to maneuver your way around the country..
3,It's good,"This is a good book if you really want to get into studying Japanese. Japanese: a language map is better if you want to learn it very quickly. Only thing is, language map is better for reviewing. This is better to learn."
1,Only A Buffoon,"Trying to sit through this album is like getting root canal. It's absolutely horrible! The singing is bad enough, but the music sounds like it was taken from a circus soundtrack and then spead up. How this band ever got a record contract is beyond me?"
3,Minor But Interesting Victorian Verse; 3.5 Stars,"Something of a pastiche, Macaulay's effort at a version of folk poetry based on early Roman history is hardly great poetry but is enjoyable and somewhat revealing. These efforts fall squarely in the mainstream of rather romanticized efforts to recover an authentic ""folk"" voice. At the same time, Macaulay approaches this work with a relatively sophisticated knowledge of Roman history and Medieval literature. But why Rome and not, for example, Macaulay's England? Beyond the heavy emphasis on Classical literature in Macaulay's Britain, there is also the British conception of itself as a new Rome. Some parts of these poems betray concerns also about social and class stratification of Victorian Britain.All texts available at Project Gutenberg for free."
2,Not so hot,"This book and the reviews I had read about it made it sound like a stand-alone guide to Project Planner. I found it to be inconsistent in its presentation, ranging anywhere from speaking to a infant in the computer world to assuming I already knew what I was doing. The detail in it's instruction was just not what it appeared to be, and that hurt my overall rating of the book. If you have the book right next to you and you've already gone through the tutorial, then you've got a fighting chance to get through this book without wasting your money or your time."
5,A 'must have' book!,"I fully recommend this book for any new user of P3. I considered it as a ""must have"" title."
5,Wonderful Henckels Pavillion Flatware,My wife and I really enjoy this flatware set. I even went back a year or so latter and bought the 4 piece set of the Pavillion as we use this everyday. The set is holding up well and is really well-made. Not one problem yet. This set is a great value for the money.
5,They rock ......,"I first learned of ""Babes with Axes"", oddly enough, from a column written by Bob Pease of National Semiconductor. He is an analog design guru and has worked for National for many, many years. On his recommendation I bought the album. They play rock in the ""Indigo Girls"" style and I think they're great."
5,Artazia collection,"These earrings are beautiful and all of my purchaces from Artazis have been wonderful, exactly as described in the pictures."
4,be warned about the knives,"I love the look of this set, too, but read the reviews for the 45-piece set also for sale... The knives really are of lower quality. I have both the 20-piece set and the 45-piece set and some of my knives are constructed of two pieces (with a visible seam between blade and handle) while some are one piece. Very annoying, but not too obvious to a casual user. I haven't experienced the white chalky substance leaking from them, but they definitely don't stand up to the dishwasher. Hand wash the knives to avoid brown ""rust"" spots."
1,Rubbish,"""Is french kissing a mortal sin?""The first section of the book seemed pretty bad, but as soon as I got to this question I had to laugh out loud. A mortal sin...french kissing...are you kidding me?!?! Talk about making frenching sound better than it is. After all if it could be a mortal sin, it must be good, right?eAll in all this book has a way too conversative view on sex, and it seems like it was written for a 13 year old. For me, a 22 year old that is soon getting married, this book was of little value. I don't feel that the author is speaking to me or being honest.In the trash it went."
3,Good Compilation but key artists missing,"This is overall a great compilation of music. However, there are numerous key artists missing. No compiltation on this type of country meets blues music is complete without Moon Mullican. Red Foley should be in here, too. Though lesser known, Merrill Moore should also be in there. There is too little Hank Snow and Hank Williams' uptempo blues boogie material should be in here, too. Umptempo blues boogie style material by Bob Wills and Cliff Bruner (and other western swing artists) would also have enhanced the collection. Also, some early Jerry Lee Lewis blues boogies lile ""Deep Elem blues"" would have completed the story."
4,a lot of great information,"I like this book. It has a lot of great and very interesting information. There are sections that get a little too wordy, but I really enjoyed this book and am now looking for other stuff to read of this subject."
3,Thank God they survived Disco!,"Coming from Squeeze, this album is automatically great. But it is a bit dated. Fun to listen to, but dated. The sound is distinctly disco, and the songs from this album are the ones I skip on the Singles: 45's and Under CD.This is, however, a classic album and a must-have for any Squeeze fan."
1,Useless,"I should have bought a real chuck instead of cheaping out on this one. This is completely useless: Isn't able to adequately hold even tiny pieces. The tightening arbors broke within minutes of use, and it even resulted in minor injury due to a piece of wood flying out of it. Do yourself a favor and buy a real chuck instead."
5,Outstanding! (or Outsitting...),"To put this lightly, this chair is the cat's meow! I am an avid backpacker and bought this chair after a trip to the adirondacks with a buddy of mine that had one. I can say that this is one item that will never leave my pack! I have turned numerous other hiking buddies on to this chair as well. It is very lightweight and packs easily inside or outside your pack. I have also used this chair in boats, at outside concerts, and pretty much anywhere I want to bring a portable comfortable chair. It is truly like sitting in a recliner. If this chair was $100, I would buy it again. There is nothing like being able to sit and have support for your back after a long day on the trail. Buy this chair, you will NOT be disappointed!"
4,vengo vengo,It's a pity the movie is not for sale anymore. I have heard of a few people who would like it.the sound track is pretty good but I would love to see the movie to get more of an overall understanding of the music.
