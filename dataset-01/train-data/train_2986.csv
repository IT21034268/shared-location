3,Chops soft foods,"Just bought this chopper at my last pampered chef party. I heard wonderful things about it from people who use it. Well, it works fine for soft things like eggs, veggies etc. However, my main reason for buying it was to chop things a bit harder like nuts. Nuts fly around the kitchen when I cut them with a knife on a cutting board. But it's nice to throw some freshly cut nuts into a recipe...hence my reason for getting the chopper. But, now the blade is all dented up from the nuts. The blade looks to be soft metal unable to withstand chopping nuts like walnuts, almonds or pecans. I'll probably send it back."
4,Great Chopper,"This is a great chopper for onions. It doesn't chop garlic fine enough for many recipes. The only problem I've had is with some of the outer onion layers; they're too tough for the blade. It is a honey to clean, two seconds."
5,Fantastic Chopper,"I love my Pampered Chef Food Chopper. I use it for chopping onions, carrots, green peppers, tomatoes for salsa, mushrooms chopped fine and even nuts. I used the Pampered Chef Garlic Press for garlic which is another amazing PC tool. The Ultimate Mandoline will slice your tomatoes, onions, zuchini and even mushrooms. I love all my PC tools and gadgets. The food chopper makes chopping fast and easy to prepare many different recipes. It is a breeze to clean. Just take it easily apart and rinse under water then snaps back together. My kitchen would not be complete without my PC Food Chopper not to mention the other items from PC that I mentioned."
5,Wonderful film,"This is one of my favorite WWII films. It's a story of a rather drab, boring married couple in England, who, at the onset of the war are separated as the husband goes into the service and the wife (Deborah Kerr) decides to do the same. Their war-time experiences transform each of them. To say more would be to spoil the enjoyment of this film. Do not miss seeing this fine movie."
4,Priest classic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is defintely an underrated Priest album. I had read several reviews that said it was a great start for JP but nothing memerable on it. I have to disagree. Every song on this is great. Although it isn't as heavy as their later albums, you've got to remember....it was 1974. Thrash metal came a little later.This album has some great elements in it. There's some pink floyd moments, led zeppelin, and definately some black sabbath. Although they came out a little later than sabbath, zeppelin, and maiden, JP has become a HUGE influence on the direction metal took and I wouldn't hesitate to say they are in the top 5 hard rock/metal bands of all time.No metal collection should be considered complete without Rocka Rolla."
4,i love this cd,"even though judas priest first album may not be thier heaviest it's by no means thier worst.this is a definite overlooked classic by judas priest fans.every song is great except for caviar and meths which is a plain boring instrumental.tracks such as rocka rolla,one for the road and cheater are great rockin tunes.dying to meet you and run of the mill along side rocka rolla are my favorite tracks on the album.dying to meet you and run of the mill are unlike anything the band ever recorded again.the other tracks are never satisfied which is a great song and winter which is not quite as good as the other songs but it is a decent song even though it kind of drags out.all in all this is a great album.a must have for priest fans and for fans of good 70's hard rock."
5,Judas Priest,Dont listen to the naysayers about this album.This is Judas Priest 1st album and it is a hard rocking album.They were just beginning to come to the greatness that everyone was going to hear in a few short years.This is Metal in the early stages of the band Judas Priest.
2,Judas Priest's first record,". . . and as far as first records in 1974 go, this is not bad. ""Run of the Mill"" and ""Dying to Meet You"" are great songs if you want to get bluesy-mellow. ""Deep Freeze"" is an experiment that would eventually become a guitar solo in the classic ""Sinner"" (on 'Sin After Sin' (1977)). But none of these tracks survived to become part of the Judas Priest live show because they are so out of place with the band's other material.Of special interest in this version of the record is the original studio version of ""Diamonds and Rust"" (which is better than the version on 'Sin After Sin') and the revised artwork (the original record had a bottle cap on the cover)."
2,NOT THE PRIEST YOU KNOW,"The first offering from Judas Priest is not too great. It is blues based rock, and sounds nothing like what Priest is known for. They were obviously still trying to find their sound and style. If your a major Priest fan I guess you should have it for novelty alone, but if your looking for a kick ass Priest album start with Stained Class."
5,This Book Changed My Life,"hooks does an exemplary job of illuminating, in accessible language, the ways in which race, class and sex intersect in ""the academy"" and in the classroom. I highly recommend this book to anyone who teaches -- in higher ed or K-12.If you are White and/or middle class and are willing to *listen* to what hooks offers, you may well say, after reading her book: ""I was blind, but now I see.""hooks may not cater to a middle-class, white readership (nor should she), but those of us who fall into those categories certainly can learn from her experiences and from her critical analysis.Open your mind. Let your defenses down. And sink into a book that can change the way you approach classroom instruction -- and, perhaps, the way you live your life."
5,absolutely courageous and brilliant,"Is there a more gifted writer in the world today? bell hooks demonstrates how white male patriarchy has influenced white feminist discourse, making it difficult for Black feminists to be heard. This is incredibly brave writing, and a must read for anyone interested in subverting the paradigms of the white male agenda of eurocentric patriarchy."
4,Mind Provoking,This book was very much mind provoking. It had me thinking about my thought process when someone asks me a question. I now think on whether I was conditioned to think such a way or is it my true original thought.
1,loving herself,"I had heard hooks referred to in articles and looked to forward to reading her. I couldn't believe how shoddy and narcissistic her writing was. Now I know why she uses no caps in her name--she is special; she is above any of the rules the rest of us have to follow. She claims those of us who teach must be self-actualized (like her) and must save the souls of our students. Ms. hooks should send away for the minister's certificate and open her own church. It isn't surprising that she has no footnotes in this incoherent collection of unstructured essays. One chapter is an imagined interview with Freire, another is a talk she had with someone at a conference, another talks endlessly about problems she had with conservatives at a college. Only today would a book like this be published and only in today's pc atmosphere would a lazy thinker like bell hooks be a full professor at an American University."
1,Superficial and contradictory,"Ms. Hooks--her affected name which she writes in lower case for reasons left unexplained to readers--shouldn't complain so much about feeling ""marginalized"" in the ""white male academy"": this book shows she is deeply embedded in it. She has mastered the old academic game: heavily criticizing ""the system"" while at the smae time extracting a comfortable living from it. She is indeed ""insurgent"" if you definite insurgency as holding a job in a prestigious liberal arts college. She is ""progressive"" if that progress involves studious avoidance of any involvement in organized efforts to change things (she lionizes ""theory"" in one typically rambling chapter, no doubt seeing her passive, shallow intellectualism as some kind of powerful political movement). All of us who are REALLY interested in political change should abandon the writing of people like Ms. Hooks and listen to people who, rather than simply thinking for a living, actually DO something."
2,Hooks and Hate Speech,"We read this book in class at the graduate level and her ideas caused a great deal of controversy. Some loved her and others were sure she was radical with no agenda except for blaming others for her anger. I thought that her book was non-academic because it was not an academic piece of writing. Color or gender have nothing to do with it. I was not impressed by her ranting against white middle class educational values because she was a beneficiary of a scholarship that helped her achieve her education. Besides, at least in this book, she can't get past her anger to give real examples of transformative education in the classroom, except to assure the reader she practiced it. Not good enough. Playing the race-card, flagrant self-promotion and hate speech is not enough. Being a revolutionary requires more than a polemic against the things you don't like. I wasn't impressed."
5,PIAA H11 Plasma Ion Crystal Yellow Bulbs (2012 Tacoma),"You can't go wrong with PIAA. The color is rich and the output is great. They are a lot better than the stock bulbs my truck came with. I paired these with a set of PIAA Xtreme White Plus bulbs and I am just amazed on how much light they give off. The price is a bit steep, but well worth it in my opinion."
4,So far so good,"These bulbs are bright and the yellow is perfect for fog/inclimate weather driving. I have only had them for 3 weeks, so I can't say how long they will last. I have had other PIAA bulbs where the coating comes off after a few weeks, these have not yet."
5,CASH MONEY,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Nita was a golddigger and Freeda was a hustler, both girls making they money. It was sad that TJ, BJ's little brother was killed. That was really sad. Especially when TJ didnt have to sell drugs. He probably just wanted to be known. I guess we'll never know if Kenya was really pregnant by BJ or if she lost the baby. Most likely she lost the baby, if she was bleeding like that. And why is it when a hustler get burnt for their money they always want to take someone down with them. So I guess Taye got what he deserved, but I guess no one really deserve to be infected with the ""Monster"". I really enjoyed the book. Very great read."
5,Lovde it,"Cash money was a good book. I read it in 1 day, once I started reading I couldn't put it down. The book has three main characters, Freeda, Anita, and B.J. Freeda and Tanita are best friends, but couldn't be more opposite. They both believe in hustling to make money. Freeda hooks up with guy who she starts driving to pick up pounds and pounds of weed. So this is how Freeda makes her hustle. Tanita is known around town for being a two hundred dollar whore. She has a different man for ever yday of the week and charges them all for her company. B.J is a young hustler drug dealer, he makes money but it is also smart with his money. I dont want to give the whole book away, but the three characters entertwine, creating a good book. I really liked it."
5,Great sturdy toolbox,"This box works great for what I need it for, not too big or too small, really sturdy and fits all my tools. Great price also."
3,Much cheaper elsewhere,"I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my new son-in-law. Since it was listed as a ""Professional Tool Box"" I thought it would be something really nice. Fact was is was just okay and then I found the exact same toolbox for only $16.99 at my local Menards (their regular price!) I paid over $40.00 on Amazon. I returned the item."
1,Bait & Switch,"Ordered a Stanley toolbox and received a knock-off Bolton Tools box. Equivalent in looks and functionality, I'm sure, but not what I ordered. Plastic smells. Too much hassle to return. Bait & switch. You guys are lame. Thumbs down!"
4,Massage Cart,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I think it needs 2 rubber wraps (just like the handle) on the bottom...the reason? WHen you put it down, even gently, it ""clunks"" and causes you to check is you scratched tile or something....not a big deal in my own home, but when I go to other homes with marble entryways, I don't want them to hear any ""clanking or scratching. I guess I will just apply myself. Other than that, it makes tight turns and is soooo much better than me shlepping my shoulder strap and knocking things around. It definately allows more control."
2,flimsy,"After about 30 outcalls, the strap has detached from the handle part of the frame. This flimsy construction makes its positive attributes much less attractive. I like the design: it's simple, easy to maneuver, light, can go up a step or two easily, is relatively stable at curb cuts and on bumpy sidewalks. Despite the good overall design, the lack of durable construction means I'm in the market for another cart to replace it. :("
4,Great cart,"I had been using an Earthlite table cart for the past several years, but found it to be poorly designed. I had to sew an extra strap onto it to keep the table from just falling off to the side. It also felt unstable and was cumbersome to transport and store since it didn't fold up.This cart rolls much more smoothly and is easy to store - it simply folds in half. No extra straps needed; the table sits on it securely. Of course if you're rolling it on a slanted surface there is the risk of it tipping over, but that's to be expected considering the size/shape of a massage table. Overall, this cart feels solid and stable, and I would recommend it."
2,Disapointment`,We were upgrading our equipment and ordered everything from Oakworks. Tables are amazing but those carts very cheaply done and the cheap plastic on adjusting the fickle tension strap broke in the second week on both carts. I called oakworks customer service and they =explained that carts are made in china and they dont have any control. REALLY??? they did send me replacement that broke after another few weeks...so we went and bought bunggy cords at Target that keep table on cart and cut those straps off. Its okay for now...but why we need to modify brand new product from reliable manufacture like Oakworks??? Doesn't make sense. Also the bottom part where table sits is to long and Oakwork table dont sitt sable on it..I loves oakwork product but this cart is not up to their standards.... I would not buy it again.
2,Doesn't work for my cat.,"I have a long-haired cat and I thought this would be great for picking up the loose stray hairs that are always left behind after I brush her, but it's really quite useless.Perhaps it works on short haired animals, but don't count on it for long-haired ones.The shipping was very prompt, just the product was a disappointment."
3,pet grooming glove,"fast service, but the glove didn't work as well as i thought it would for a long haired cat."
2,Very Poor,I purchased this a couple a months ago and while looking online it look like a good product...But when it arrived at my house and I opened the box i was disappointed it is very thin and bendable...and while it sits on your table the fans on the bottom are what is holding it up!
2,"works fine, the cord is cheap",I've had this cooler for about 6 months. It started out working fine. Then after about 3 months the fans were making a lot of noise. Then after 5 months the power cord started to come apart. Now after six months the USB adapter on the power cord has broken off completely. When I first got it I noticed the power cord was very thin and cheap I thought it would break but not after 6 months of light use. Spend a few extra bucks and get something that will last.
3,"This is for a Net book, not a laptop!","Good item, but it needs to say that it is for a net book only. Way too small for a laptop."
1,Not worth it,"This product came in on time all intact and it works fine. The only problem is that its to small for a 17"". And when i plug it in and use it, it doesnt cool down my laptop at all. You can either return this product or take it apart and make a custom cooling pad."
1,Cheap and Flimsy,This device is made of a very cheap and flimsy material. I no longer use it. I replaced this with a Belkin lap cooling product and I have never looked back.
1,You get what you pay for.,"This is a flimsy product.The open face design is not terribly well suited for a laptop, in that it is difficult to maintain balance and positioning of the laptp on the cooling device.Additionally, the wiring is fragile and power can easily be disrupted. I actually had to use plastic ties and duct tape to harness the power cord so that it would maintain a stable connection. Otherwise the fans would not spin.Noise level is acceptible.For me, the unit finally found use for a laptop that is connected to an extrenal moniror and is used with wireless keyboard and mouse. That laptop stays in a fixed location and is not subject to balancing or positioning problems.If you need a cooling unit, I suggest you get a closed design."
1,Don't buy it.,"After few months, the USB cable stopped working because its cheap quality. Dont buy it as its not durable."
1,Useless,"I've bought this one for my 15"" Dell. This product is indeed looks and performs cheap. While all 3 fans are working my laptop is just as hot as it was w/o this thing. Verdict - useless."
3,Not big enough for laptops,"This item is listed as a cooling system for laptops, but the one I received said it was for a notebook, which of course, is normally smaller than a laptop. It was way too small for my 15"" laptop. My laptop just kept sliding around on it. My laptop either hung over the back of it or slid off the front of it. It was a pain. I sent it back and Amazon gave an instant refund, though, so thumbs up to Amazon, thumbs down for this product.It did work, however, but it felt like a very cheaply made product.. I would suspect after a few weeks, the blades would have all kinds of lint and dust accumulated on the fans since they were just open."
2,Flimsy,"This cooler is made of extremely thin material - can't tell if it's plastic or lightweight metal. It warps with barely any effort, and ""squishes"" under the laptop.I would say spend a little bit more and get a quality cooler.Note that the fans are exposed underneath. This was as I expected, and I didn't care since I expected to have this on a desk, but be aware you can't use this on your lap."
1,A BAD buy,"This is a VERY cheaply made item. Its made in China and comes with those terrible instructions that are written by someone who doesn't quite understand english. The product itself is cheaply made. You could never set this on anything but a flat desk surface. The wires and switch connections are open on the bottom, the metal is very thin and offers very little support and the fan design is less than efficient. I couldn't be more disappointed with this purchase. Avoid this laptop stand & cooler."
1,USB Powered and Most NON Efficient Cooler Pad,"The product arrived in a nice package and on time as it was described on the confirmation e-mail. The problem that I had with this product was not the cool metal pad or the 3 built-in fans, but the fact that it DIDN'T Work. I tried it on two other laptops with the same result. If anyone is considering buying this product, research and find some other one."
2,Long lasting it's not!,"Nice enough product, but fans are already going out. The unit helped cooling my laptop and I was happy enough with the product, but it wasn't 6 months and the fans are growling and going out. They are extremely noisy on start up and do quiet down after a minute or so. I am just disappointed they didn't last longer with no more use than I gave them."
3,not very effective,"I got this because I liked the idea of having a 3 fan cooler... however I discovered that more fans DOES NOT equal more air flow. My old cooler pad has 1 fan in the middle and moves 10 times more air than this one. Do not think you will be able to use this for any laptop over 15""... the little plastic feet will make a larger laptop slide all over it. Also, because it has an open back design you cannot use it in your lap... it has to be on a desk or some sort of flat, solid surface (I started using a TV tray while I'm working with it on the couch). The power cord is about 6""-8"" too short to be useful with my laptop (all of my usb ports are near the front).Overall, I think I got what I paid for... but I would not recommend this unit to anyone who can afford to spend another $15 and get a good, name-brand cooler."
4,good deal,"Received this product in good condition. Works as expected. Keeps my lap top cooler. My only problem with this product is that the fans are all placed near the back of the cooler. There is 3 fans but I wish the 3nd fan was places a bit more to the front. Over all a good deal. All metal construction won't fall apart. Easily repaired if needed.Update 11-30-12I don't regret purchasing this unit one bit. It is working flawlessly. I am glad i chose a metal cooler rather than one of the ultra cheap plastic coolers. This unit also has an off switch, so if you don't want to leave it run when your computer is at idle you can toggle it off, and then turn it back on when you need it."
3,Fan pad,"This fan pad works great, keeps the laptop cool except the design is flawed. The laptop keeps sliding off. The bottom edge needs to be higher because the fan covers get caught on things. And the screws on the fan covers are junk, they're too short & don't stay screwed in."
3,When it works it's great......,"I like the item except the bottom is all open and the wires have come off twice now. I think this would be an excellent item if the fans were encased and there was a bottom to it. When it works, it works great. I may have to purchase something else though as I have had to have my husband fix it 3 times now.If I was to use this on a table or hard surface and not move it around much it probably would work better, but my laptop and I are mobile."
3,UCPA,This effectively keeps my macbook computer cool while I work. Plug and play. I wish the bottom was closed so I could use it in my lap but oh well cheap and does what it is suppose to. I didn't want to spend extra money so opted for this cheaper version for a desk. Wish I would have spent more though. Oh well. Still serves the intended purpose!
1,"Rebranded Kinamax, Don't buy, You might as well throw away $20",This is the exact same product as the Kinamax. It will stop working after a short while because the wiring is cheap. You will spend time removing the on/off switch to jerryrig the wires in order to keep the fans on all the time. Waste of money.See my other review on the Kinamax NTP-3. It is the EXACTLY THE SAME!
5,Chill Pad for Laptop Computer,"I have been very satisfied with this chill pad. It works very well, and there are four extra USB ports in it which come in very handy. The product has been very worth while purchasing and I would definitely recommend it."
3,It works for the purpose but the wiring is weak,"The aluminium material used to make this item is great, it is truly well designed. The only problem I found is that after about 3 months of continuous use, some soldered cables came loose and I had to fix them."
2,"Good for Desk, Bad for Lap","When using this to cool my laptop (13"" Dell Latitude) it did well when the laptop was on a desk or other hard surface - probably well enough to earn four stars. However, I really bought it to go between my laptop and, well, my lap. In that application it's all but unusable thanks to the pad's plastic feet bearing all of the laptop's weight onto the tops of my legs. That might sound like a petty gripe with an otherwise good product but after using the cooling pad for five minutes it quickly became uncomfortable. Since the laptop fails to work as I wanted it to it'll soon be headed back to Amazon."
3,"Not for 17"" HP G7","I purchased this, expecting it to be cheaply made but it's not too bad. The fans work and seem to blow a fair amount of air, so it does what it's supposed to do in that regard.I have a 17"" HP G7-131 Notebook and the notebook does NOT stay on the stand well at all. The ""lip"" at the bottom of the stand that should hold the notebook in place and keep it from sliding off is far too short and the notebook slides right off of it unless I am sitting at my desk and not touching it. I know if it keeps sliding it will scratch up the bottom of the notebook. It will work for me for desk use only.Considering what I paid for it, it'll do until I can get something larger that will fit my 17"" better."
2,"Efficient cooler, but too fragile","When I first got this cooler, I was extremely happy with its performance. It kept my usually burning laptop after a pleasant, cool temperature and kept the heat spreading well. But within a week of arriving, one of its wires snapped, rendering the entire thing unusable.There is really nothing on the back to protect the wires from bumps and scratches, making it far too vulnerable to damage."
3,good but under-powered,I like the simplistic construction and the aluminum platform. I like the fact that is raises the laptop off the desk surface to improve airflow. I do think that powering 3 fans off USB power leaves it inefficient. I would sacrifice its nearly silent operation for a little more power--so I did. I spliced a 7.5v 250ma dc power block to it after I noticed significantly increased system fan activity. Hopefully that will help.
4,Does the trick without breaking the bank,Best cooling pad on the market from my perspective because I can replace the 5DV fans whenever I need to and I can rig-up a 5VDC wall power supply when available. As of right now I am making a metal base for the pad so that it can sit on my lap with ease.This thing isn't flashy but it is light and cools...what else do you want for the price tag?I have owned previous models of cooling pads and they are cheap so that when they break you throw it away. This guy can keep going even if one of the fans fail (whenever that may be).
3,"powerful, but wires exposed. Not good for travel!","This is not exactly what I had expected.THE GOOD: I am pleased with the three powerful fans, the on / off switch, the angle it holds my computer, and the amount of air flow. Airflow, I give 5 stars! It really is perfect for a stationary workstation.THE BAD: It has exposed wires which I guess would be good if you need to repair one of the fans, but as for travel it is too easy to damage. Also, it is not good for in bed or lap. I think for the cost, I had hoped for a more durable product."
3,Well worth the money,"Been using the cooling pad for over a year now.its better than the other brands I used earlier. my previous one was plasticy and broke down in just a week. This one has a sturdy body, and I have taken it with me overseas multiple time, and despite all my ill treatment over the last year, it still works fine. the only problem is that the fans now make an audible sound, though that is probably due to me and my luggage packing skills. Would Definitely recommend !!!"
2,As Cheap as the Price,This product is worth no more than its price! The fans blow out so little air that it has no effect on keeping my laptop cool. You are better off saving your 15 to 20 bucks and just blowing out your own air on your laptop.
4,Worked well for what I had.,"I had a Gateway computer and it plugged up fine to that and worked, but that laptop ended up falling apart. I have it under my current HP laptop to keep it from just sitting flat, but unfortunately the USB cable for this device is not right for my HP. Great little thing though if it works for your computer."
1,Cheap junk,"Complete junk. Only 2 of the 3 fans worked out of the package. The wires and everything were completely exposed and hanging out. It looks like somebody put this together in their garage while drinking a case of malt liquor. Trust me on this, find a different product."
3,"The fan part is fine, but it's designed weird...","The price is right, and the fans are fine. Here's the thing: it's open on the bottom, so if you plan on using your laptop on your lap as intended, be prepared to feel the little propellers against your legs. The good news is that its not painful, since the fans are plastic, but still. Not fun.But, if you keep your laptop on a desk, you'll be fine."
2,I STILL can not play my computer games,"Sure it cools my computer for normal use, but it does not help with PC games.I bought it because Halo and Counterstrike overheated the computer. I STILL have these issues with this cooler running on high. Pretty disappointed."
1,Open back???????,What good is a LAPtop cooling pad if you can't put it on your LAP??? Nowhere in the basic description does it mention the open back. If I sit it on my lap the fans hit my legs b/c they are totally open! I would have to put a book then the cooling pad and then the computer. Rediculous.Don't waste your money.
2,Inexpensive but flawed,"As some previous people have commented, the bottom wiring and even screws are exposed. This leads to discomfort while using as on the lap as opposed to another surface. The wiring is loose and can in some instances be snagged on loose items. This happened to me where the connections near the on/off switch (which are very exposed) caught on a something and were pulled free.From my experience the fans are not as quiet as some people have said. They are regular fans used in most PCs, just serialized and set onto a lightweight frame. The only advantage the whole unit has is the frame itself which does help to distribute some heat and is angled for airflow.Luckily the unit is inexpensive and may be worth buying if you want a cheap, alternative to having your laptop lay flat."
2,Cheap,"There's a reason the product shots are taken from the top. This device has exposed wiring underneath. It's a piece of 1/8 inch stamped sheet metal with the electronics bolted on underneath. The plastic knobs that the laptop sits on are simply pushed into place and hang there loosely. If you actually use a laptop on your lap, this item is not recommended. With no bottom surface to speak of and exposed components, this pad only makes sense in a desk-mounted setting. I chose to send mine back."
2,Below expectations,"Sub par product, after two months has develops a squeaking sound, looks like a child built it, and its not even strong enough for the computer fan to turn off. I only give it two stars because it still runs."
1,Died in 2 months,"This is the worst laptop cooler I've ever had. My laptop has heat damage (thanks to my roommate first semester of college), therefore I can't run it without a fan unless I want to crash in the space of 2 hours. I've gone through a number of different laptop coolers/ fans and this has been the worst. First of all, It has no protection for the fans at all, to the point that I have to find a large book or something like that to set the cooler on so that I can use my laptop in my lap and not get the fans caught on my clothing. That was a huge annoyance, but something I could deal with. Then it turns out that the cooler ends up dying on me in 2 months or less after I purchased it. Yuck!!"
3,causes a my gateway to not function,"Hello, I ordered this to replace an old fan that I had. But, as soon as I plugged it into my gateway (model M-6843)laptop, it shuts down. Once it's off, I kept trying and trying to turn it back on, but it would not turn on properly. But as soon as I unplugged it, my laptop came back on. My fiance and I kept making sure it was the fan and it was. BUT, we recently purchased a new Hp Laptop and it works perfecty fine on his. Im not sure if its just a compatibility problem, so I am not talking bad about the seller, but it definitely did not work out on my laptop."
3,"Works great, but",Works great. Keeps laptop nice and cool. Open back feature caused large scratches on my new cherry coffee table. Need to have something under this if going to use it on a surface you do not want to get scratched.
3,"Cools my laptop, but could use some improvements","I've had this cooling pad for more than a year. When it's working, it definitely cools my laptop. It's not terribly loud, but I do notice the fan sound. My primary complaint are related to the exposed back of the unit. As others have commented, you can't really put the pad directly on your lap with the laptop -- it's just not comfortable. More importantly, if you need to transport your laptop and cooler often, this may not be the product for you. The wiring on the back of the unit is easy to disrupt; it became disconnected early after I bought it and I have had to play amateur electronics repair person several times in order to fix the wiring. Also, it does have some somewhat rough edges; once I just threw my laptop in my backpack with the cooling pad instead of putting my laptop in it's case first; the result was several unsightly scratches on my laptop."
4,Noticeably cools down the laptop,"I have an HP dv20000 at 14.1 inches its a little less than average sized. This unit fits it well and is USB powered which is very convinient. My laptop used to run very warm, now its just a little warm if keeping this unit constantly on. The only thing I don't like is that it raises it more then you would expect, especially from the back, and theres nothing under neath it so you can't use your laptop, well, in your lap, it has to be on a desk. Overall good product but keep it on your desk and expect your laptop to be pretty high in the air and tilted, some may like this but I don't. I also do not like the look, it looks very cheaply made and strange under my laptop."
3,"Good idea, a little outdated","I just got mine in the mail today, and with the cheap price tag, i wasn't surprised to find that my 15"" laptop hangs off about an inch on both sides. This chill pad would be nice for 13"" notebooks and smaller. It still stays stable on my desk, and the completely open bottom makes sure cool air gets circulated. It's pretty quiet as well. As far as the issue of my laptop hanging off the sides, I'm assuming this is an older product that didn't account for all laptops being widescreen in the future. Just a guess.Good product for the simple function of keeping your notebook cool."
1,disappointed!!!! 0 stars,"I received this piece of junk today and it is missing the back and it is not worth $2, much less the price I paid. It looks like something a child would put together for a school project. I ordered it for my daughter to keep the heat off her lap while doing schoolwork and I am so disappointed! Even if it worked, I would have been better off going to WalMart etc. I have ordered many, many things from Amazon, this is the first time I have gotten junk. Believe me this is the last order that will come from me. It is an inconvenience for me to return items as I am disabled. Do better, Amazon."
2,"decent, but some faulty wiring","decent little 3 fan cooler, but it had some serious wiring faults. they were easy enough for us to fix, but very annoying things. The switch is wired backwards (off is on, on is off..) and the wires from the fans to the switch were not soldered, they were barely touching the studs and then shrink wrapped, so they didn't stay put at all. Hopefully we got a fluke, otherwise, their QC sucks.Was easy for us to ""correct"" and get it to work, but it is certainly something to be on the look out for. My step daughter used it once. it worked, though she didn't notice the switch reversal, and then it wouldn't work again because the wires had all come loose. This is what led us to take it apart to see what was going on and fix things."
3,works good,"keeps my lappy cool, usb cord is a little short, it just barely reaches my usb in the front. when you hold it, it feels flimsy, but is sturdy on desk. all in all worth the price, i like the on and off switch."
3,Sweet,"Tiny bottle, big fragrance! This particular product doesn't last long on the skin but it was a great way to try this fragrance. A bit expensive for such a small amount."
1,Terrible,DON'T purchase this item if you believe you are buying the one in the picture. The actual item is a miniscule bottle about the size of a thumb packaged in cheap plastic and paper; unlike the floral hinged box that is shown. The bottle in the picture holds 1/4 oz instead and is much nicer than the one they actually send.
4,If you want to know more about plants and applications,I bought this book for my mom and for all the unknown plants around my house. And I find it a pretty good book for research and fast lookups of odd plants and what they do.
1,Didn't Help,I've got an abundant weed in my garden and I'm wondering if I can eat it. So I bought this book as a reference to see if I could find the plant. It didn't help. The drawings are black and white line drawings and its not laid out as a reference book. I didn't find my plant after leafing through the whole book. I live in the desert southwest and the author states almost noone comes here. This is not a book for westerners.
5,a must-have!,"I wouldn't give very many books five stars, but this one thoroughly deserves it. The line drawings are better than pictures for identifying plants (I have had better luck with them anyway). The book has humor, great info on what to do with the plant once you've identified it, and more thorough treatment of history and other uses of each plant."
1,Very disappointed with black & white pictures,Very disappointed with black & white pictures. I am new to plant identification and expected color pictures. I would have gladly paid $15 more for a color version of this book. What a disappointment.
2,Beware of Kindle edition,"All the accolades in previous reviews are accurate. However, the drawings are so poorly scanned and pixelized on the kindle version that they are almost useless. Shame on the publisher. Fix this!!!"
2,I'm not buying it,"Quick skim shows a lot of ""the component that may make you sick"" verbiage without actually naming offensive compounds.... Kind of useless information for those of us with sensitivities that we understand.Seems like an OK book but somewhat lacking in critical substance for a MEDICINAL HERBS guidebook."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed when this book arrived. It's all black and white inside. The cover online was deceiving. Also...there is lots and lots of talk about wild plants and there are a lot of recipes which I wasn't looking for. I wanted a book listing what plants are edible and what each is good for medicinally and vitamin/mineral wise. This book gives alot of information but there is no easy reference such as an index saying something like ""Dandelion: vitamin C, niacin, B2, good for indigestion, antiseptic"", etc., etc. This book will probably get donated somewhere as I'm trying to find the book I was really hoping for - listing edible wild plants and herbs and their basic nutrient/medicinal value."
1,Useless,"Amazon.com sells many fine books... this is not one of them! The only color images are on the cover, inside you'll find only tiny, useless black and white drawings. I would give this book 0 stars if possible."
5,Great Prepper Resource!,"Very helpful, good info, I would highly recommend this book to all beginner preppers who are unfamiliar with local plants."
5,Get this book now!,"This is a fantastic book. Very thorough information about finding, identifying, harvesting, preparing, and uses of edible wild plants. The plant drawings are fantastic and much easier to use than color photos. I enjoy his emphasis on finding edibles in your lawn or other ""not so wild"" places. Also includes lots of invaluable information on poisonous plants to avoid and poisonous ""look-alikes"" to beware of. He has a great sense of humor and an entertaining style. I bought the book and then had to immediately by another as a gift. I just got lunch by weeding my driveway..."
5,Nice thorough book on the subject,"Sorts edible plants by seasons- a great idea. Good line drawings, good info."
4,Great Book!!,WOW! This book has most any plant you can think of. I wish the pictures were in color but I'm sure that is a cost issue. Well worth the money! Very Interesting and Informative!
3,SoSo,I was not happy that this was not in color. If this expert knows what the plants are...it shouldn't be too difficult to take a photo. I would have been happy to pay more for the book if it included color photos of the plants.
1,Couldn't finish it,"I usually look forward to Jaid Black's novels, but I couldn't finish this one. The reason? Because I already read it. Basically it's just like the short story she wrote for the Tie Me Up Tie Me Down anthology with the same premise and same characters. Another factor working against it: it's too long. The original story was easier to read because it was so short.This time around the forced marriage thing and the limited to no rights allowed women really got to me. I had trouble getting into the romance when the woman's whole life is being forcibly taken from her. If this kind of thing works for you, go for it, the first story of this same premise was somewhat interesting, despite it being very frustrating and infuriating. If you've already read the other one, then avoid this one."
2,I'd live under a mountain with HIM,"The writing's pretty bad, the plot completely unbelievable, and yet I somehow found myself a little charmed by this book. I'll confess that the ""hero"" did do it for me and the sex scenes were decent (if you can get past the giggle-inducing phrases uttered by our hero during the act). But I found myself eventually skimming through chapters that were just utterly pointless in order to get to the juicy stuff."
3,Not one of the best,I have to say this was not one of my favorites. I love Vikings!! But this was a little too unbelivable. I understand that we reading about the paranormal and fantasy but this was just not up to notch.
4,Can you say Viking,"I enjoyed this book! The only problem that I had was the plot, or lack there of.I really enjoyed the characters and the funniest part of the whole book is Drake. She is the lead female characters sister.I will definitely read more by this author."
2,Puh-leez get an editor,"Granted, I am reading for the smut - but don't insult me with this silly stuff. I like fun amongst the hot scenes, but the writing was hard to take. This was my first full-length novel of Jaid Black's and with her wonderful Ellora's Cave claim to fame I figured it was a good bet. Good thing I'm not going to Vegas.If there is a Jaid Black novel worth my time, please let me know what it is - I might be willing to try again.One star goes to the cover - nice packaging!"
1,JUNK,"I got this yesterday, listened to it for an hour.. Tried to turn it on today, nothing, no sound, no radio, no CD, CD lid won't even open. I knew for the $$ it wasn't going to be the greatest radio/CD, I just hoped it worked more than 1 HOUR... I was wrong... Please don't waste your $$"
3,"El album ""Gaia"" es mejor que este!!!!","Esta coleccion tiene buenas canciones, pero faltó la mejor cancion de la banda que es Alma! tambien faltó La Venganza de Gaia.""Gaia"" es el verdadero album que contiene lo mejor de ellos."
2,Lackluster,"There are, sadly and oddly, not that many compositions for guitar and piano. The two most popular instruments are difficult to play together, I suppose, since the guitar is so much softer in volume than a piano. This is one of the few CD's I've ever found with duets.The musicians seem capable enough. Perhaps it's the material, or the acoustics, but this recording just seems not terribly exciting. The compositions are lackluster. I can hardly hear the guitar when the piano plays. Can't recommend it."
4,Good product. Hardware is not that great.,Good product. Hardware is not that great but it fit perfect and gets the job done
5,About time!,"I'm sick and tired of having to explain to Scottish people why I'm interested in Scottish Gaelic culture. Maybe if they read this book they'll get a good idea why it is important to Scotland as a whole (not just the Highlands), and why we should be preserving the language instead of ignoring it, or being hostile to it. If nothing else I wish someone had come up with a book like this earlier! The nearest equivalent is 'The Companion to Gaelic Scotland' which is really an encyclopedia and contains numerous omissions."
1,Great Religions of the World,This product was not as expected for the price of $59.95. I was really disappointed. It should be sold for $5.00 or less. It is about a half hour long. Don't buy it! I am returning it. I expected to receive 4 DVD's for that price.
1,33 Minutes to cover ALL religions?,"Yeah, that's what this joke of a DVD tries to do. I spend 42 classroom hours over an entire semester teaching the world's religions and it is still inadequate. To even try to pretend to cover all of that material in a half hour is mind bogglingly silly. As someone else pointed out in their review, to charge $59.95 for 33 minutes is ridiculous. EVN videos tend to be on the insipid and vacuous side, but this is the worst I have seen. I am not sure who the supposed audience is supposed to be for this. Certainly not college or high school students. Don't get this."
4,Nice Long Sleeve Shirt,"This button down long sleeve shirt fit me well and the color is rich, price was affordable and lots of colors to choose from :)"
5,Buy again - yes I will!,"This stuff is like magic, without the ""p""luff of pharmaceuticals. Non drowsy, it simply works!"
5,Works great,"This worked great on my towncar, once you grind the rivets off the old one and get it out. This one was easy to install. Make sure you order the right one for your car."
3,Ok...,Item was received as described. It worked well for several months but then in February I noticed that it was no longer secured to the ground. I advise getting a different type of adhesive if you purchase this item.
4,Great and inexpensive treshold kit which includes the adhesive.,"This is the pretty good product and it was able to cover my 2 car garage door. It covered most of the door, but having an additional 4-6 inches would have made it perfect. It also comes with an adhesive tube, but I used another high quality brand in my installation. I used the adhesive in another project and I noticed that the adhesive had a strong toluene (solvent) smell. This adhesive may not comply with local restrictive VOC laws due to this observation. It really stinks so be careful where you use the adhesive."
4,"Not bad, but would recommend a better adhesive.","As others have noted the adhesive with this product is marginal. However, in my case, they sent a large tube for a chaulk gun, so I figured the manufacturer had upgraded from its previous glues. Bad mistake. The glue provided set unevenly, and moved even after about 48 hours the first time I drove over it. So, I pulled the strip up, scraped it and the floor and re-laid it with Liquid Nails. Now, it looks better and does the job."
4,As expected,"All items as expected. You will need an adhesive gun to complete the project. I had to cut my shield but no problems. The material is hard rubber, but pliable.It gives about a 1/2 inch lip to your garage floor which is nice unless you get a torrent of rain. The adhesive is strong and I have not seen any problems in the last few weeks since I bought it."
4,BETTER GLUE PREPERATION,"Really like the product. Installation would be better with 2 people, but not impossible with 1. I think application would work much better if adhesive were in a grease gun type applicator. I'm a little older and squeezing the tube by hand was a bit difficult. I also purchased a bit more adhesive to cover better(liquid nails).I recommend this product, it does the trick."
4,Sensible Solutions garage threshold was the solution!,Works well for keeping out rain and weather especially when door closes flat to a slab. Use liquid nails instead of the adhesive supplied. It's a simple solution to an irritating issue for a reasonable cost. I recommend the product if you have the need!
4,garage door strip,This was pretty easy to install and has performed well for over a year now. It does exactly what I was hoping that it would do for me.
5,Great Itme,"This thing works great. I used to get water in under the door when the wind and rain blew from the North. Not anymore, highly recommended"
5,Sealed up tight,"We bought this product to keep the little critters from crawling into our garage. Once the product was lined up correctly, my husband placed masking tape along the line where he was going to lay the shield. That helped keep it straight to place the liquid nails on the ground. It's nice not to see any sunlight below the door any more."
5,Stayed in place for 5 years.,"I installed 2 of these 5 years ago, they are still doing the job. No more water in my garage."
4,makes a great floor dam,I used the garage door threshold to run a partition in my 2 car garage. It keeps melting snow from getting to the other half of the garage where I keep my BMW Z4 which is only driven in the warm months.
3,"Not as bad as before, but.....","After reading other reviews on this item, I took the suggestions of using liquid nails, instead of the glue included with this item, and after installing, I used a professional caulk that is made for both concrete and plastic, around the ends of the Storm Shield. Unfortunately, I still get some water coming in. It's not as bad as it used to be, but I'm still disappointed that my garage floor wasn't completely dry. I might try some additional caulk along the entire front of the shield when things dry up, as I really can't see where the water is seeping in from...Oh well...."
5,Garage Door Threshold,"Exactly what I was looking for, good quality product and was installed in a snap, and the price was more than good, most of the other sellers ask for almost twice as much for a similar product. It really does the job at a great cost."
5,Excellent for uneven garage floors,"We just purchased a house that had some issues with an uneven garage floor. Apparently some tree roots pushed up one side causing a 2-3"" gap from left to right. After installing a new bottom seal, I installed this seal to the garage floor.First I put the garage door down and pushed the seal in. Next I took a sharpie and marked the inside line of the seal, raised the door, and marked the outside line. I picked it up, put down some liquid nails, then carefully put the seal back in place.Now I have no more cracks. When I close the door, you cannot see any daylight coming from the bottom of the garage door. It's a great product. Worth every penny."
4,Storm Shield does the job,"After having to sweep out rainwater from my garage for years, I decided to install a threshold. I purchased Sensible Solutions Storm Shield and, after a relatively easy installation, I found that it solved the problem. The vinyl is heavy duty and easily cut at both ends for a snug fit. They provided two small squeeze tubes of a special cement to bond it to the concrete floor, but if I had applied it according to the instructions, it would not have been enough. Anticipating that, I called the company and was told that there *would* be enough. By skimping a bit, it worked out. Someone in a forum suggested using construction-grade glue, like Liquid Nails, but the mfr. warned against it, saying it would ruin the vinyl. All in all, I would recommend the product."
4,Saved my garage!,"I had problems with water coming under my garage door. It rained right after we got it installed and it let nothing in. The installation isn't difficult, but you have to play with it a bit to get a tight fit that won't make the door go back up. We had to trim and cut off some of the top to make a tight fit on the ends."
5,Stops the leaks,"I had an ongoing problem with water seeping intomy garage ever time it rained causing days of puddles on the floor.After installing the Garage Door Threshold, the water no longerpuddles on the garage floor. I added extra sealant to the edges.I am very happy with my purchase."
4,"Works Well, Needed More Adhesive","Storm Shield works well. Ran out of adhesive had to quickly grab some all purpose cement to finish the job. Don't think it was the best material for the job, but when your 90 percent done you can't stop and take a break to go out and get more glue."
5,Door Shield,"This product was exactly what I was looking for, to keep rain water out of my garage. I did use ""Liquid Nails"" to adhere the seal to the floor, only because there is more product in a tube of it, compared to what is provided with the seal itself.I am happy with the results!!!"
5,Dry Garage At Last,"HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH RAIN WATER BLOWING UNDER MY GARAGE DOOR. I PUT THIS STORM SHIELD DOWN AND NO MORE SWEEPING OUT WATER EVERY TIME IT RAINED.IT WAS VERY EASY TO INSTALL, I USED LIQUID NAILS AND GOT A VERY GOOD SEAL. I CHECKED OTHER PRICES WHICH WERE A LOT HIGHER.I GIVE THIS PRODUCT A FOUR STAR RATING."
4,Works well for me.,"I bought this product to help seal out mice from getting into my garage. I had some settling in the floor of the garage that provided an opportunity for the critters to squeeze under the door. I used this to help alleviate the gap and it has worked. It was a little difficult doing by myself, but I managed ok. Gluing and unrolling the threshold was a challenge for 1 person, I suggest asking someone to assist you with the installation. The sealant they supplied worked fine for me, I haven't had any issues with it as some other reviewers have noted. All in all, a good product and fairly easy installation."
4,garage threshold,The threshold was installed just a short time ago. Installation was extremely easy - however had to wait for weather temperatures to exceed 40 degrees. I am hopeful that it will keep out water seepage; it has already reduced the air seepage. The only challenge is when you have to trim for size of the door opening.
2,"Helps a little, but not great","My husband installed this, using Liquid Nails as other reviewers have suggested. Unfortunately, the product doesn't keep water from coming in, for us. Our situation is probably more challenging than most people's, since our driveway has a steep downward slope toward the garage, and therefore, we tend to get a lot of water pooling at the bottom of the driveway. Having installed this garage door threshold, we probably get a little less water. However, if there's a really big storm, we still take in plenty of water. Maybe it decreases the accumulated water by 20-25%. We're disappointed. Wish they made a one that was an ""Extra Strength"" barrier, a bit higher, for those of us with bigger water challenges."
5,Works. Dont get Liquid nails!,"Threshold dose what its supposed to. As for the glue caulk that comes with it and the review about it, It comes with a single 10oz caulk tube and was not hard or hard to squeeze out. They changed the glue since that review. I installed this when it was about 35 F outside. I heated it up in front of a salamander propane heater and it made it very easy to work with. Just follow the instructions and youll have no problems at all. I would also suggest going to the hardware store and getting a tube of Polyurethane caulking for the area between the threshold and the framing on the door. This will keep all water from coming in on the edges as well. DO NOT! I repeat DO NOT Get Regular Liquid nails construction adhesive! It is not designed to hold up to water. It will break down over time leaving you with a ruined threshold. The polyurethane caulking holds up better to water and is generally black to match the threshold."
3,Okay product,This product did not come with enough adhesive to put it down. Also trying to get it down perfectly straight was not all that easy. It does appear to do the job it was bought for. which was keep the dirt out.
3,Not exactly as advertised.,Product had some issues being deformed. Not allowing it to lay straight. No instructions provided. Adhesive not as good as some other name brands.
4,The Storm Shield works great.,"The storm shield arrived pre-cut and was easy to apply. I had a slight problem with the cement lip of my garage being 1/2"" off the driveway, but some extra grout took care of any gaps left between the garage floor and the storm sheild."
4,Wiil see,Pretty easy to install. Had everything but chalking gun an utility knif. easy to understand instructions. Took about 20 min. Will have to wait to see how well it works.
4,works as advertised,Worked well during storm. No water entered the garage at all. Hardest part was cutting the edges of the threshold to fit around the garage door brackets on the floor. I have a 16 ft threshold. The provided glue was not enough to hold the threshold- bought DAP Alex Plus to provide the waterproof inner and outer seals. No complaints.
5,Works Great.,Easy installation. First hard rain this weekend. Not a drop of water on the inside of the shop floor. Very pleased. Can't figure out why I waited so long to get this and install it. Highly recommended.
1,STORM SHIELD GARAGE SEAL,I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AFTER MUCH RESEARCH AND READING THE REVIEWS ON AMAZON.WE JUST HAD OUR FIRST HARD RAIN SINCE THE INSTALLATION AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.I FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY GOT A GOOD SOAKING RAIN WITH SOME WIND MY GARAGE STILL HAD WATER BLOWN UNDER THE DOOR.I GOT THE BEST PRICE FROM AMAZON BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE I GOT AN INFERIOR PRODUCT.I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT NOR CAN I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ELSE.
2,Didn't work,"We installed this in our garage, to prevent water leaking in during storms, but the first storm after installation, and there was still water coming in. SO, it didn't correct the problem we bought it for."
3,Not for finance professionals,"According to the Preface, Mr. Borge writes to pique [the reader's] interest in Risk Management. The reader to whom the author is writing is a reader without experience in finance. Indeed, in his effort to avoid the depth or rigor of a risk management textbook, Mr. Borge eliminates much of what a finance professional might find interesting in a book about risk management. Business professionals with a background in finance may find themselves hungry for more substance than the book has to offer.On the other hand, Mr. Borge successfully describes risk management in terms that individuals without experience in finance will understand. Throughout the book the author applies risk management principles to situations encountered in daily living. These simplified examples give the book a sort of 'Who Moved My Cheese' feel, reinforcing my experience that the book might appeal to non-financial types, while leaving financial-types wanting."
2,Not for heavier weights.,"I could not make it work with the olympic weights. I could find a video in you tube with instructions, but there too , its not shown how to use this product with olympic plate. This by itself does not come with any instruction."
4,TA for the non-witchdoctor,"""God forbid a fairly analytical book on TA minus all the folksiness and equivocation. Great read and definitely worth the time for someone who is at best suspicious of TA. """
5,How to Trade Like An Educated Adult,"Anyone whosse spend years trading anything from commodities to stocks, bonds, futures, etc., etd, etc., knows every trick, every system, every damn cliche that's come down the subway line. And it's exhausing parsing through the same nonsense year after year only to find the same systems and information you pored over the year before. To everyone who trades I tell you it's all right to grow up now, read Richard Weissman's book and trade--and profit--like an actual adult. For God's sake take a minute and actually think about the information he's developed for you and use it like you've just found the teacher's edition in your high-school statistics class. Otherwise, just read the book of the month, and continue trading your soggy tear-off Monopoly pieces from the sides of your soggy McDonald's cup in the wild hope of bring home a free order of large French Fries.Free Yourself. Free Your Trading. Free Your Thinking. And For God's Sake Grow Up."
1,Disappointed,"Save your money! I was very disappointed! I've been a student of technical analysis and mechanized trading methodologies for years, and Mr. Weissman's book presents nothing new. He mostly references previous works (some classical) by such authors as Perry Kaufman, John Murphy, Robert Pardo and Welles Wilder. He, of course, references his own publications. The few methods he does present are poorly explained and have been better developed, tested and documented by such other excellent authors as Martin Pring, and Colby and Meyers. I have donated Mr. Weissman's book to my local library. Maybe some beginning student of technical analysis will find it useful."
1,boring and useless,"I am a profitable trader. I bought this book for the promise of covering mechanical systems. Well, the book presents nothing new and useful. Its just a bunch of systems using RSI and stochastics that anyone could have done themselves. The systems are only marginally profitable and have huge drawdowns, just by sheer luck anyone could create similar systems. No equity curve is ever shown. This book is useless."
4,Stacey's Big Break,Stacey's Big Break is one of the first in the series of Baby-Sitters Club videos and one of the best. If you've ever read the books this is exactly how you pictured the characters and the actors do a great job of bringing them to life. This video is just plain fun to watch.
1,desapointing,"after reading all the Harry Potter books in english wich i enjoyed extreamly, was looking forward to find how much fun would it be to read them in spanish (my first language) also. i'm so desapointed with this ""dictionary"" translation, the book lacks feeling, fluidity, i find it choppy and to my amaizment was to find SO many gramar incorrectness in the book, this translation shows no real effort to capture the spirit of the caracters. it's a shame that the translators did not take advantages of all the posibilities that such a great language as spanish offers to give this book the same feeling and fun to read as the english versions."
3,Easily expandable train set,This set is fine for a young child interested in toy train set It is easy to set up and reasonably durable. Be sure to snap the two pieces (which make up the base) together firmly; otherwise the rails may not match and cause the train to derail. Also the crane will knock the engine off the tracks so I suggest not installing it. Finally the engine is really really fast! You can slow it down by removing the gear which couples both sets of wheels together; the instructions will tell you how to do that.
4,Cute story,This a cute sleepover story to share for a little one's first sleepover whether it be at Grandma's or a friend's.
3,Hmmm,Not as good as other similar books by the same writer.It is harder to read for some reason.Have read many books on or by Nisargadatta and he remains my favorite teacher.Would not recomend this book to a friend.
5,"""The Experience of Nothingness"" - Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj",Clearly expounds the nature of the experience at the heart & soul of this school of profound teaching. i.e. the ultimate goal of the spirtual quest.
1,Waste of time,"Not easy to use, not helpful, not a good product.I just wanted a simple way to print checks. This product is confusing and needlessly complicated. It requires you install 2 programs just to print, does not allow ""real"" print previews (you can ""mock up"" something in the print design program). The only way I will be happy is if I manage a full refund. What a horriable dissapointment this program turned out to be."
4,what i got was good,Great smell and easy lather producing. Still haven't got everything I ordered. But the product itself exceeds other soaps in its rich quality. Doesnt irritate my sensitive skin either.
4,Running To Ourselves,"This is such an important work for parents, teachers or anyone who cares about the inner landscape of children. By reading Steve's book you will be transported back to your own childhood and adolescence.Within it you will find a mixture of humor, resilience and moments of pure grace. One could not help but to come away from reading ""Running"" with more compassion for our children but most profoundly for the children we once were.""Running"" would make a great book for families of teens or junior high students to experience together, as it provides many opportunities to discuss topics appropriate and challenging for today's youth."
5,Running From the Devil,"I found out about this book by word of mouth and was intrigued by it's premise. Once I started reading, I could not put it down. Not only is it fascinating, the writing style of Steve Kissing is flawless. It's one of those rare books that you think about for days after finishing."
1,Not a good deal!,"I unpacked the mister-fan and upon assembly discovered that a critical mounting of the motor on the rotating fan assembly was broken and was un-repairable without replacement of the motor assembly mounting casting. A good deal of the original Styrofoam packing material was omitted or discarded from the prior owner contributing to the breakage in its latest shipment. (Or, it was never repaired, but just re-cycled into the sales stream.)Don't think I'll be buying reconditioned equipment any more."
2,Bad phone - avoid and get something better instead,"The phone is not bad except for the fact the price does not match the quality. I paid about $170 at Costco for this phone and I am going to bring it back next week because it is simply not worth more than $50.Here are the cons: 1) No display when phone is shut - which means you WONT be able to tell who is calling you UNTIL you flip open the phone. How stupid is that? That has got to be the stupidest design idea from Samsung yet. I generally love Samsung but what idiotic designer thought of this? 2) Static noise when you are dialing 3) Keypad is very close to other keys next to it so you keep pressing the wrong buttons. 3) Screen is terrible because colors are not very bright and resolution is very lowPROS are the big style buttons. There isnt anything else positive about this phone. I expect Costco to either drop this phone soon or else, continue to sell this crap and keep getting returns on it."
1,"Terrible phone, do not buy!","This phone is terrible.Here are the reasons:1) Bad reception. My other sprint phone worked in my house, this one doesn't work very well2) Terrible sound quality. I have a very hard time hearing people on this phone. My old sprint phone and my current Nokia phone are fine and I can hear them clearly.3) Battery comes undone and turns the phone off. The battery comes loose and turns the phone off when you keep it in your pocket. This started after 6 months of use.4) The hinge problem. My wife's phone broke on the left side when she opened it. We took it to the sprint store and they said it was ""Abuse"" and wouldn't honor the warranty it even though it was still under warranty.I don't have any problems with ""Sprint"" just this Samsung phone."
2,Phone gets VERY HOT !,"I got this phone on July 2, 2004. I charged the battery and after two days of not using the phone, the battery was dead. I recharged the battery several times and the it keeps dying even though I don't use it.I went back to COSTCO and I was given a new battery. The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT! If I call my mom and am on the phone for 20 minutes, it is UNCONFORTABLY HOT and am unable to continue conversing.My guess is that this phone is good for emergency calls but not as your only phone. Furthermore, the guy at COSTCO told me that the phone is not designed for long periods of talk time. I asked what was the phone for?Anyway, am going back next week and have them exchange it for another one. If that one gets hot too, then I may just consider cancelling my contract and getting my money back. I have never had a cell phone that got so uncomfortably Hot."
1,Samsung VI660 is defective,"Stay away from the Samsung VI660 phone. It definitely has a defect in the hinge mechanism. I have had TWO of them - both of which quickly cracked in the same location - between the hinge and an indicator light.I had to get the Better Business Bureau involved to replace the first phone because neither Sprint NOR Samsung would replace the first defective unit.I now have to go through the entire process of contacting the Better Business Bureau, Sprint and Samsung in order to get this second phone replaced. Ugh. Whatever happened to standing by your product?Hopefully this will save someone else the same aggrevation."
1,Horrible,"This Phone Is Extremely Horrible. I got this phone in 2004 and i totally hates it. it gets horrible reception everywhere, drops every single call and has horrible battery life (instead of the estimated 3.4 hours of life, it gets only 1 hour of talk time). the only way i gets service is by roaming and even then it will get only one bar. everytime i try to go online the phone freezes and shuts down every time! this is the worst phone ever. i want this phone terminated and want to get a Sanyo MM-8300 Phone, from which i hear has excellent reviews.this phone deserves to go into a trash can"
3,My phone,"I got this phone the beginning of March. I've been talking to Sprint about once a month or more trying to get problems fixed. The phone said I was in roam, and I wasn't. It doesn't always like to ring when people call me. I also do not get good signal. I think those problems are not because of this phone though. I think it is more a problem with the company because that is why I got a new phone, and I'm still having the problems. The only real problem I have with this specific phone is that the ringer is quiet. The other thing I don't like is that the games that come on the phone are demo games and only have level 1 then asks if you want to buy the whole version."
2,Great Phone but Horrible Service,The phone is great for me since I am always on the go...But I feel also the worse thing about the phone is the reception and when you text message people you get nothing but pure errors on this phone....Now I enjoy the plan I have but Sprint needs to step up in the services and reception. I love to text message but if its not going to work then there is no need for this crappy phone!
1,CRAZY TEXTS,"When I bought this phone I was told it was the best phone out there. Now after 2 months later I am sorry that I even bought it. I have no reception in my house if anyone were to call me,if someone does call and i am in a different area of my house i have to walk around and say ""Can you hear me now?"" And who wants to do that?I don't for one!!! My last complaint is the texts messages,I thought that was something we are able to do on the phone but when it comes to my phone I get error 38 and I am not even receiving my texts. So I ask why have this phone? I might just think about throwing it away and going to someone else!!!!Unless fixed!!!"
3,Samsung V1660,"Have had this phone since May, 2004. Like the size but do wish it had the caller ID info on the outside so have to open the phone to see who was calling. The number pad sometimes feels awkward and not so easy to use. Easy to hear parties and clear sound. Enjoy downloading ringers, etc to give lots character to the phone!"
1,Don't buy it,"Mine fell apart after 6 months. The clamshell just split into two pieces, with no abuse or dropping it by me. Lousy product, buy something else."
2,Garrison Keillor,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. Compared to other Prairie Home Companion DVD's, this was sort of low key, dull and did not have much action. To be honest, I found it boring when compared to the DVD giving a fictional account of the show's final radio broadcast."
5,A Praire Home Companion With Garrison Keillor,"WoW, this is very entertaining, and fun. I highly recommend this to anyone at any age. I especially loved the stories with all the sound effects. I have a great deal of love for this show and all the talented folks on it. I have been a listener for years and getting the chance to see behind the scenes was a treat. Check it out you won't be disappointed"
5,Rapid Reel GH164-PL Garden Hose Reel Parallel Wall Mount,"A fine 100% USA made product. The quality is outstanding!The details have already been covered by other reviewers.When the reel is rotated, it feel like it has ball bearings - no end-play, no leaks,& smooth as silk."
5,Industrial grade quality,"Solid steel construction adds to the durability of this American made product. Easy to use with what appears to be ball bearing roller and simple installation with instructions (about 30 minutes). The price is a bit higher but quality costs and you will be glad you paid the money every time you wind it up. Works so well that I just ordered another one. Rapid Reel also makes first quality 3/4"" garden hose. The best I've seen."
2,I don't know whether to laugh or cry,"... so I'm doing both. The highest (or lowest) form of kitsch meets the lowest (or highest) form of misappropriated fantasy.Shaking head, laughing sadly ..."
3,Survival Study Skills DVD,The Survival Study Skills DVD is a study skills program with a survival theme. I picked up this DVD from my local library. This program has solid information and its entertaining. The skills that are presented will help students. The only problem I have with this program is the 69 dollar price! My students can learn a few tips from this program.
4,Would of been her 1983 album.,"This would of been Suzi Quatro's 1983 album, but the big wigs of her record company didn't want to release it, it finally saw the light of day in 1998. ""Unreleased Emotion"", is a solid album, i don't know why they shelved this one. Here are some of the highlights,""Pardon Me"", for me is her answer to the Blondie hit ""The Tide Is High"", the hard pop of ""There She Goes"", the tough sounding ""I'm A Rocker"", Len Tuckey puts out some good chords here, the Blondie sounding new wavy ""Strange Encounters"",the funky ""Comes The Night"", the 50's sound of ""Starry Night"", The Move type sound of ""Good Girl (Looking For A Bad Time)"", the rolling ""Just Like Momma"". On the 2 bonus tracks Mickie Most produced ""I Go Wild"" and ""Tonight (I Could Fall In Love)"",they remind of Kim Wilde numbers of the era. Thanks 7t's for releasing this one."
2,They're ok.,"I was very disappointed as I absolutely adored my old dearfoams-wore them literally until they fell apart (about 4yrs), these are ok but dont match up at all, they got cheaper over the yrs-not BETTER. They're no where near as comfy as my 1st pair. Not sure I'll buy dearfoams again unless they go back to whatever they were doing before."
4,great slipper,I got this as a gift for my mom this Christmas. She loved them. She says they offer great support and mold to your foot. I got her one size larger and it barely fit so I would suggest ordering a size up to make sure it fits. She normally likes wearing socks with her slippers but with the size issues is not able to do that. She says they are so warm that she doesn't need to wear the socks so its not a big issue.
3,They're Okay,"The slippers cover my feet and are soft inside. I wish the sole were soft--bendable. It appears the sole was intended to make it possible to wear outside, but I only use them indoors. Otherwise they're okay."
4,My Experience With Dearfoams!,"I really like them, would have done 4.5 but didn't know how to do it. My Clog were not to long or short. the black will smear your floor, but not a problem. Sometime feel a little loose, but overall I am satified. The support is good, Very nice house shoe! The price was great, would I buy them again absolutely."
4,Comfort and Warmth for your Toes,"Aah,how delightful to slip your feet over the side of the bed and into a cozy pair of slippers. Warm enough for cold New Hampshire mornings yet not too heavy. Just right, I would say."
5,Microfiber Terry Clog Slipper,"These slippers are warm and comfortable. The clog sole makes them ideal to wear outside and supports the foot well. I would recommend these slippers highly! In fact, I have purchased three pairs because I like them so well. And, the price is very reasonable."
3,Wouldn't buy again...,"These slippers were just ok, the feel almost reminds me of memory foam. I prefer to have a hard bottom on my slippers and these were a little too flexible for my liking, but you'd think otherwise for as loud as they are on my laminate floors. After about a week, the right side of the right slipper started to wear down so the edge of my foot was starting to slip and my heel would be on the ground. I suppose these slippers would be good for someone who didn't only wear slippers around the house, but unfortunately I do."
3,I wasn't as satisfied with this as I thought I would be.,"When I first got these slippers I really loved them. But it seems after I had worn them for a few months, the materials started to ""unravel"" for lack of another word to describe it. Maybe I should not have washed it in the washing machine, but I always wash my slippers. It just seemed to wear away a lot faster than I thought it should. I probably will not buy this style again."
5,Excellent Product!,"These slippers have been so wonderful.I used to buy cheap slippers from Payless shoes about every 3 months. They would always wear through until you were just standing on the plastic sole. In January, I bought a pair of tempur-pedic slippers thinking that they would be comfortable and long lasting like their beds. Unfortunately, the tempur-pedic slippers fell apart in only a few months.I hadn't ever heard of Dearfoams before coming on Amazon and searching ""slippers."" After reading several reviews, I decided to buy them and try them out. They are the best slippers I've ever had. As someone else's review said, these are machine washable. I bought two pairs so that I could have one while the other was air drying. The plastic sole is very durable has barely worn in the three months I've had them. They are true to size. Excellent value!"
4,My wife likes it,It was a present to my wife.She adores the colour and in the winter she loves the heat it preserves .Good overall quality.
3,Pillow softness does not last,"I always wear my slippers with socks, and like to wear them all day at home. By bedtime, these were almost flat, very little cushion. Without the cushion, they are loose, and not comfortable at all. I think these would be OK for just a few hours before bedtime, but not for all day wear. I was really disappointed!I decided to try the ACORN Chinchilla Mules, which I got on sale for only a few dollars more. They are MUCH more comfortable and warmer too!"
5,Love these slippers,"These slippers are great. They wash up nicely in the washing machine. They are nicely padded, soft, and comfortable."
2,Loses cushion,"These slippers are very comfortable at first, but quickly lose their cushion. They are machine washable/dryable (dry them alone for a full cycle, then dry with your next 1-3 more loads of laundry to get them completely dry). They ""reinflate"" for a brief period after washing, but will be flat again after about 1-2 hours of continuous wearing. Buy these slippers if you wear them between bed and the shower, you'll love them; if you wear your slippers for extended periods of time, try authentic tempurpedic slippers. These slippers have rubber soles suitable for wear outside. Don't make the mistake of slipping them on over socks to run to the mailbox or the extra padding will make them feel super flat and a size too large until you wash them."
4,Soft!,"These are soft and comfortable. I have a rather wide foot and they are very accomodating. I bought some for my niece, who has a normal size foot and I understand they are also comfortable on her. The bottom is a bit too thick for my comfort, so I knocked my review down to a 4 star. They are still very comfortable, however."
1,Oldie but not goodie,"The original monopoly game sounded fun, but what you get is the alpha version of monopoly. There have been several upgrades to make the game more playable in the form we now know it. In the original version the board does not have the cost of the property indicated. The property cards do not have the backside printed with the pertinent mortgage information. The original tokens are not that exciting. So all in all the later versions have been upgraded to enhance playability.Even in board games the later versions are superior."
3,"Good quality, but not as quiet as you'd think","I got this fan to replace one I have at work that is failing.It works fine, moves the air great, doesn't take up much desk space in my cube, but if it is close, it is so loud I can't hear my stereo. The guy in the next cube over can hear it. Not so good.Maybe with time it will get quieter. If it had one speed slower it would help tremendously.The good news is that it has a remote control. I'm going to set it at the far end of the cube and let it roar away over there."
5,Not for the passive listener...,"As ""true lyricists"" this duo has been writing dynamic and clever rhymes for over 10 years, so as this album progresses you get blessed with a style and effect that is unmatched in the mainstream music scene of today.All in all, you will only get out of this album what you put into it. So as your ears get tugged by the sic beats and amazing work on the 1's and 2's be sure to listen just a bit closer and feel the message this pair is delivering every second of every song."
4,80's kick ass,"I love the 80's. The greatest decade of all. Great Music, Movies, Clothes, and the beging of Videogames. How can you not love the 80's. Although these cd's arent that great they only give you a few of the songs so thats why i would give it about 3.5 stars."
1,Not so fast,I was thinking of getting this set but after sampling some of the clips it appears to me that these are either new recordings of old tracks live recordings. They sure don't sound like the originals.
1,knock-offs,Betty Davis Eyes is definately a knock-off - NOT the original song. Why is Amazon selling this swill?? I want my $.99 back
3,"Classics from 80s, Not bad, FOR THE PRICE","Loved the music, and was very satisfied with price. Although, someone, MUST WORK ON PACKAGING TO MAKE SURE ITEMS DO NOT GET DAMAGED.....My CD case was broken in half, I'm lucky that the CD didn't get damaged!!!"
4,ASP.NET 2.0 XML explained,"This book was very useful. It covered a wide variety of topics and explained most topics very well. I would have liked the book to get into some more subjects a little more in depth, but when you are covering so many topics that is a little difficult to do. This book did cover a lot of the new XML classes in the 2.0 framework. I would have liked some more info on the sql server 2005 xml stuff, particulary xquery. The book talked about OPENXML and even made the statement that you should use .nodes for these types of queries now. But it made no mention of how to do so. Overall, this was a very useful text."
2,Not that great,This calculator does not have a TVM function. I need that basic function for my finance class. I purchased it online after reading the reviews it got and thought it was going to be great. I am now disipointed because I cannot use it. I needed that basic function.
5,Love this calculator,Is really easy to use and it can lead you to the right answer. I use it almost every day in college
1,Not Reliable,"I bought FC200V in lieu of HP17BII+ due to the price and reviews written about FC200V on its reliability. Unfortunately, calculation on amortisation is incorrect. In my case, the amortisation involves few series with different frequencies. Another upsetting result is in calculating TVM for an ordinary housing loan financing, FC200V could not produce BLC. PRIN and INT are not of any problem.I called up importer of Casio but the support is very weak. I can't speak to the person in charge. Was asked to explain by e-mail. Time is of an essence - so, I returned the FC200V and because cash refund was not allowed, I purchased a microwave in return. What an UPSET! Don't buy. I would recommend HP 17BII+ but since this HP can't be used in CFA exam, Texas Inst BAII Plus Professional I believe is reliable. I haven't tried Texas yet. It is certainly worth trying. Price is cheaper too."
3,too complicated to use,"I bought this calculator to be a cheap replacement over the most common HP models. Being a business student, I needed to do certain financial calculations, but I did not like the way built-in functions were presented. I guess I'm used to the old, more simplistic style of entering data.Love the big display though."
4,casio FC-200V,The financial calculator works good. The directions really helped me to figure it out with ease.
4,Calculator,Great Seller... but the product isn't so great. The calculator is confusing and hard to use...
1,RIPOFF,The product itself is great! Love it - but buy it elsewhere! Other craft supply outlets sell it for $5 or less for a 2 oz. jar! Don't get ripped off and pay 3 times what you should!
2,disappointed,"I was rather disappointed with this product. It was not what I expected. The coating is thin and hard to use. I can't get an even coat on the pliers.Also, it was expensive...I found it later on other sites for 1/3 the cost."
2,Disappointing,"So many products make promises they don't keep. This is one of them. They say it's tough.Sorry, it's not tough at all!I started making chainmaille jewelry recently and needed the softer jaws on my pliers for the soft metals like aluminum and silver. I have to redip my pliers every week and then they are out of action for 24 hours becuase I let them dry for that length of time. The coating peels off after just a couple of days use. I even tried a friend's suggestion of double dipping but that didn't last either. I'm looking for something more permanent.Beware buying it online as the price is jacked up. It's half the cost from a craft store even with tax added."
1,Can't deer spot!,I received the Spot Light about six months ago. It wouldn't light despite charging it for days on end. I found that the battery that it came with was defective and wouldn't accept a charge. I put in a new comparable battery. It works now but is definitely not as bright as the 2M candle power they claim it has.
2,Oldie but goodie,I reread this book and found it to be much more wordy than I remembered. It still was a good story and I enjoyed her books very much.
5,I love this gun!,I have had this gun for over two years now and it is in perfect condition! My two hundred dollar AK47 is only a year old and is practically broken. I have won countless airsoft wars with this pistol and I would recommend it to airsofters of any kind. I decided I liked it so much that i wanted to buy another one. I was right! Just so you know-TANGFOLIO MAGS DO NOT FIT IN THIS GUN DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND BUY THEM and pay the extra five dollars for the black one it's worth it!Pros:realistic feelgreat rangeGreat sights280-350 fpsLast wicked longHigh-capacity magComes with two paper targetsCons:ABS Plastic (do I care?)Non-blowback-which should annoy people who enjoy dual wielding pistols...:(
4,Very tight groupings!,"The gun is pretty well made with tight tolerances and smooth action. The sight is a little off, so it shoots high, but the groupings are very tight compared to other airsoft guns that I own. The magazine capacity is nice and high, but there is no way to look and see how many bbs are in it. The reliability seems pretty good. I've put a couple of thousand rounds through it and it still feels like the day I got it."
2,"Spring popped out with only light use, 2 days after returns expired","My son was excited to get this Airsoft pistol, but had only used it for target practice in the backyard 4 or 5 times when the spring popped out. We can't figure out how to put it back and are having to pay shipping to return, and I suppose, to have a replacement sent to us. It seems it should have lasted longer under such light use. However, until the spring came out, he was very happy with this item."
5,Can't beat the value,"Very solid gun, especially for the price. I've send hundreds upon hundreds of rounds (that hurt) through this thing in the few months I've had it. No complaints from me."
1,Junk!,"Having recently discovered Airsoft, I was excited to try a different pistol than the crossman 311, so I ordered this one, thinking the larger mag and metal construction would be cool.Not! MUCH harder to load than the crossman, and terribly inaccurate - at least 7"" above where I'm aiming! (and I can hit a 1"" circle at 16' with the crossman, so I know it's not my aim)Do not buy this gun."
1,not good,"I bought this for my 14 year old son who shoots son who shoots regularly and this is his review: ""This is crap, I hate it. It does not shoot good and I cant hit anything; and neither can any of my friends. Just not a good gun."""
2,Horribly inaccurate,"The gun itself is sloppy and at 15' it's hard to get a gouping of less than 8"" even using a stand."
4,no major complaints,"ive put this pistol through some serious fire fights in the last couple of days and has held up amazingly. the only things i would warn about is dropping it, which is more my fault than the gun. but this pistol is so accurate my buddies love it!"
3,Ok but plasticky,"This gun shoots well, but it's light and feels easily breakable, especially the cocking mechanism/hammer. I read a lot of reviews saying how good it was but i am skeptical about its durability over time. Definitely lighter and much more plastic than a real 1911. That may be expected, but I also have a G2 Spring Pistol of the Walther P99 which actually is heavier and more metal than the real steel piece. I also do not like the 'bronze colored Plastic' on the hand grips of this gun. Would prefer woodgrain like on my cybergun/softair thompson 1928, or even black. Bronze plastic looks fake. It's not a BAD airsoft gun its just 'unrealistic' looking and feeling, which is the opposite of the impression I got from the reviews i read here. Thats why i give it a 3. Solid performance for a spring gun. Cheap construction."
4,It's Pretty Good,"Well, this gun is alright. The sights are a little off, so just aim a few inches below. But, I'm a ten year old girl, and it's really hard for me to cock. My brother has a little trouble cocking it, too. I would recommend this gun for kids 11 and up. But it's still really good. At the place that I got the gun, this UHC 1911 was the best spring pistol there."
3,Good Gun for the Price,"I bought this gun in May for my son, and he has used it a lot. Now in September the tip of the gun has fallen apart. Even so, it is still a good gun for the price."
4,"Great gun, but...","This gun is great. I got it in 4 days after ordering. Everything works great and it feels great. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I did not get the color I wanted (I bought the black 1911, but received the black and silver one)"
4,Pretty powerful little gun.,"Seriously, this is surprisingly powerful for a BB pistol. That fact alone merits 4 stars in my opinion. However i stop there because the accuracy leaves a bit to be desired. Using the sight for precise shots just aint gonna work. The build of the pistol itself prevents the sight from lining up targets properly. That being said, once you familiarize yourself with the variance, your accuracy will return in spades, and that is where its power kicks in. I bought it to scare off raccoons and cats that have been digging up my tomato plants, lol. It isnt strong enough to really hurt them, and doesnt stand a good chance of even penetrating their skin, but it does scare them, and so mission accomplished. Also, it is just plain old fun anyways to shoot around the yard at various targets. So, all in all, a good purchase at a great price.Enjoy!"
2,Great- if it lasts.,"While I had this gun , it worked o k. But it jammed a lot and was tough to unjam. It was accurate and powerful, but when for the 100th time I had to unjam it , it broke and doesn't work."
2,"Crappy Gun, Don't Buy","Expected Item to be metal, but it's plastic. On the second day of light use the sights broke. I have never even dropped this gun. This is a crappy Chinese airsoft gun. DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,Pretty good pistol,Arrive a little earlier than i expected. This gun is more powerful than a rifle i had. Its still hard to believe this is spring operated.
4,good inexpensive gun,"This is a good gun for $20, very comfortable to shoot. Like another reviewer, mine shoots high at close range (probably due to the hop-up). I solved this problem by borrowing my girlfriends orange fingernail paint and putting a small drop on the front sight. This makes it easier to aim as well. use the top of the orange dot for close range (<30') and bottom of the orange dot for long range."
2,Not worth the money,"Got this airsoft pistol for my daughter. She did not use it much when she first got it for Christmas 2010, but recently has been target practicing, the gun stoped working after about 60 rounds. The trigger will not pull back and stay. Can not figure out what is wrong. It is past the date that we can return the item. Wasted money."
2,Not accurate,"Looks good very realistic for a cheap plastic airsoft pistol.Pros - reasonably powerful, realistic, grouping is about average for this price range, sturdyCons - sights are very inaccurate about 8 inches off at 15 feet. slow and somewhat difficult to load. Trigger action is pretty rough.There are much better airsoft pistols in this price range.I probably should have given it 3 stars but rated it a little lower because I feel it has gotten higher ratings then it deserves over all.I have not had it jam, It is sturdy and holds 21 bbs.I don't shoot it much because of the inaccurracy, rough trigger action and I don't like how it feels in my hand,"
1,piece of shit,"this is an inaccurate hard to shoot terrible piece of shit just get the crossman stinger p311 its zoo much better, this gun is a big fat poop on a stick that is not even worth a star"
4,GOOD LITTLE GUN,"i bought this for my 7yr old son to shoot. its a lot of fun, but it does feel a little cheap, which is expected at this price. the slide, is a little hard for young kids, but thats an extra safety feature in my eyes, because that means he cant shoot it unless im present. the bb's shoot pretty accurate, from about 10-15ft out. passed that, and they fall short. overall, i think its worth the price, but its certainly not the greatest airsoft gun out there. still fun for kids, though."
3,"Good for the money, but not accurate","For about $20, it's a fun toy. However, it's not very accurate. At about 10-15 feet, the bbs are high by about 3-4 inches and left 1-2 inches. They group fairly consistent in about a 1-1.5"" spread. I tried both the bbs it came with and some crossman .20 bbs.At a distance of about 20 feet, the bbs are high by about 6-8"" and left by 4"". The group spreads to about 4"".The gun cannot pierce an aluminum can or cardboard at point blank.The inaccuracy is likely due to the manufacturer's attempt to increase distance with the fixed hop-up system. However, the inaccuracy makes for frustrating target practice."
3,Nice gun for a beginner,I love the gun.It had everything I wanted.The gun is great for beginners.After shooting the gun for awhile the gun got boring because I had to cock the gun after every shot.The gun is the best spring gun I know.
4,Fantastic Sidearm!,"Great gun, very powerful and horizontally accurate, you do have to judge for vertical accuracy when aiming down the sights though because the hop up system in this thing is very strong and causes a large arc when firing a bb.Another thing is that the orange safety cap at the tip of the barrel will get shot off due to the extreme hop-up system in this gun. But without the cap, the gun functions a bit better without it.All and all, this is a fantastic sidearm to use in the midst of battle, pretty durable, accurate and powerful! A must have!"
2,UTG Airsoft UHC 1911 Pistol,"I bought this and it came in yesterday. I am already disappointed with it. When I pull the slide back, some of the pellets are allowed to come out. They usually fall out 2 at a time. The gun itself is not too difficult to pull back, but it does require some muscle. It tends to fire 2 pellets at once also, it's already happened once that three came out at once. It's got the power, no doubt about that, but this 1911 SUCKS in the aspect that so many pellets can come loose just by pulling back the slide!!!"
2,Disappointingly bad sights,It's powerful and relatively accurate but my copy suffers from poor sights. The front sight is so low that using it for a standard sight picture will shoot about two inches high with a six o'clock hold at 5 meters. Construction is mostly loose fitting plastic that the slide now wiggles after less than a hundred shots through the gun. Disappointing.
5,Increadible,"Totaly worth only $30! For a spring airsoft gun, it is an increadibe side arm. You could go into a war with only this and possibly come out the winner. Completely blew my mind and passes all my standards. Great look and will scare all of your enemies. Must buy for all ages."
5,pretty awesome gun!,"this gun is pretty accurate and cheap and fast shooting with huge clip! could have some more metal but hey its really cheap and cool. has cool hammer system! fits in holsters too! i saw this is right behind c02 guns, due too its accuracy and power for a spring. but tough and holds lots of bbs! like 30 bbs! it will last a long time! and pretty durable gun. and feels legit. so yeah recommended gun, best spring pistol around!!"
4,four stars,"this gun is awesome,but one thing is bad;the magazine just broke in my hands whileI was loading it.fortunately I fixed it with some electrical tape.I advise you toput about 12 to 16 pellets in at time."
5,love it,much better than the other spring action i bought before i really like the hammer effect and its pretty strong i punched a hole in a yugioh tin with 30 consecutive hits (i was bored and curious lol) accurate to
2,shoots way to high and to the left,So this thing had great reviews and maybe mine isnt one of the better ones but at 25 ft it shoots about 8 inches high and 4 inches to the right. At first i thought it was me but in fact its the gun. So i give it 2 stars. It does it with crossman bbs and the ones thwt come with it.
3,It's okay... No thrills,"The gun is very light and all plastic. I'm an adult and wanted this to just practice draws on the cheap. It serves the purpose. But after about 15 feet, it wings the bb's all over the place."
3,Horrible Aim,This pistol is very powerful. It shoots straight but is way off on height when using the sights. It shoots about a foot high at 20 feet.
5,awesome gun,amazing gun shoots straight very accurate falls at about 30ft. very painful hahahai would recommend this gun to anyone who is into airsoft or target shooting.so over all i think it is a great gun!
5,"Experienced shooter, first to own (mom's account)","(This is my mom's account)My first airsoft gun that i have owned!! I always shot my dads and bros guns, but now i have this, and im not ashamed. my bro says its a steal at 20 bucks, two of my friends want one for airsoft battles. a little bit hard to cock, but thats all."
4,is this gun plastic,i really want to buy this gun but i want 2 know if it is plastic please someone tell me.
3,this gun is ok,ok first of all im not a kid!! im just to lazy to make a password..and second thing is the kids review above me is a pozer!! the 1911 was not used in WWII is yea...this gun is ok its good for the money. the accarcey (sry cant spell) is ok ...its not really all that powerfull. for 15 bucks it isent all that bad.i shot my self in the leg and the olny this that happend was i got a small welt.if you want a real gun check the sig p226 now thats a gun!!!
1,Dont buy it,"The hop up system makes the gun shoot ridiculously high. At ~10ft its dead on but anything after that it gets worse about 10"" at 20ft.I bought based on the good reviews but if the gun doesnt hit what your aiming at then why buy it?Otherwise its a solid gun that cant hit anything."
4,Great Buy!,"I recieved this 1911 spring gun in the mail just last week. I am very happy with it! It will almost always hit the mark, and it's about as heavy as the real deal! I gave it only four stars for the magazine. Although it has a large BB capacity, you have to load them in one at a time. This obsticle, however, can easily be resolved with a speed loader. Over all, considering the price and quality, this gun is a GREAT BUY!"
4,Perfect for less than $20,"This gun came in very quickly and works just as expeted. VERY fast and powerful, already accidently shot myself in the leg, OUCH!!! Almost goes comppletely through kindof think cardboard from a box. I can tell that the quality is less than the full metal version, but for 1/3 of the price I think if I am carfull, this gun should last a long time."
5,Great gun,5 star gun a great spring gun if you know how i would put a new spring upgrade my gun is at about 425 fps mostly metal or very sturdy plastic i strongly recamend buying this
4,first airsoft gun,this is my first airsoft gun i have bought it shoots very good but breaks easy dont drop it very realistic looking according to a veteran who carried it even the interior looks very close to the real colt 1911
5,Epic,"Everything you want and more, not full metal but good abs plastic. my only complaint is the poor Japanese translation of everything in the manuals. looks great and easily modified, fires good and has reasonable round capacity, very well weighted and cheap."
5,Nice,"My daughter loves this air soft pistol, she walks our trails and practice shooting! Would recommend to other people! It's light and shoots nice!"
5,A great quality pistol with an inexpensive price!!,"This gun is amazing!!! It is heavier than most pistols and it has great power and accuracy. Of course it isn'nt as strong as a gas gun, but it is great for a spring pistol. Make sure you buy .12g bbs because the hop-up is speacialize for only .12g not for .2 g bbs. The only thing that I have an issue with the gun is how the slide is loose, but you can fix that by putting your slide safety on so it will not move around.Great Gun, Good Quality, and Good accuracy!! I highly recommend this pistol, it is awesome!!!!"
4,A nice gun.,"This pistol is rather nice and is very accurate. The main problems I have with the gun is the orange tip will fall off, it can become at times a bit hard to load if grabbed near the hammer and has a very extreme hop up. The things I like though would have to be the accuracy. After 200 - 300 BB's with this thing you will become a pro on accounts of accuracy."
3,airsoft pistol,this is an ok gun not what i expected 12+1 mag heavy weight no metal or rails not a good secondary gun better for beginners low fps i do not recommend this gun
3,Good for pest control,"Not real easy to load, shoots considerably higher than aim point. Does what I wanted, scares dogs out of my yard for 20 bucks."
2,Use too much to make deep colors,"It takes a lot of drops to make deep colors, I ended up using an entire jar on 1 batch of candy (was trying to make a deep rose red color and started out with red wafers). Was very disappointed, I'll purchase larger bottles from Candy Suppliers in the future."
5,Bright Love!,These colors are bold and bright! They are very high quality and work very well when making hard candy! I would recommend these.
2,"Blue was missing, 2 oranges came instead","Colors that I used came out great, but unfortunately the blue was missing and 2 oranges came. This was very disappointing because I was making my childs Lego cake...so no blue...feel I am owed a real pack."
3,A little color please,With the candy coloring product a little color goes a long way. i suggest to use a small amount because the dye has a bitter taste so if your adding to frosting use a small amount if using in batter your fine if your using it in candy do a small taste test first with a small finished product then use more if its to your taste.
3,food coloring,Would have rated this a five but it arrived damaged and the blue was every where. My hands were stained for half a day. I could not avoid the mess I opened the package and it went all over me.
2,Blah tasting,The cookies are unexceptional. Dunking them in milk helps. Love the fact they're without chems.
1,Gross,These are disgusting. I tried giving them away at work and people got mad at me because they tasted them. The ones in the red package taste more like oreo's than these do.
5,Nineteenth Century Home Architecture of Iowa City,"Great book, very informative about Iowa City, a must for anyone living in one of Iowa City's victorian houses."
5,Awesome hose reel,"I needed one for inside my garage and I first tried the plastic ones you buy at Sears and Home Depot. They all leaked at the swivel and I didn't care for the flimsy plastic so I returned them. Finally decided to break down and spend the extra and get a ""first quality"" hose reel. The Rapid Reel will not dissapoint you! The materials are superior quality metal and not one single drip leaks. The swivel mechanism is brass (not plastic) and works very smooth in conjunction with spinning the reel. Everything about this tool is awesome, including the price with free shipping and no tax. You cannot go wrong with this one!"
1,Warning - Unstable Product,I bought two of these for my church. I struggled with these products for 4 months before finally convincing the VAR to let me return them. There are severe bugs in the firmware and possibly the hardware. I went through 4 RMAs with Netgear before giving up on the product. Technical support was great but engineering just couldn't come through with a fix. Look at the forums before purchasing to make sure that the issues have been addressed.
2,"works, but lots of trial and error due to poor documentation","Got 2 of these to make a local area network between myself and neighbor down the street. We have what I think is a fairly simple network (router to ap to remote ap), and between the awful documentation, terible support (besides language issues, they just won't answer the questions you ask), and a web interface issues, I am quite disappointed. 2 stars because it took my friend (a guy with multiple network certifications), and myself (with a bs in computer science), many evenings to get it to work. Would have done 1 star if we never got it working. Even now, we don't have the house-to-house thing inplace due to needing a better antenna. My advise: go straght to the forums for support if you can't get it working on the first 10 tries. This might be a good piece of harware, but without good software and good support, it is not worth buying."
1,WEAK SIGNAL,I purchased this router to add wifi to a 5 unit CBS guesthouse.I assumed at the cost of $160 that I would be getting better signal strength than my $40 Westell router!I got a significantly weaker signal.As a router this unit would be ok at about a $40 pricetag.I found nothing about it to justify a cost 4 times that.I have returned it and gone to a much less expensive router with greater signal strength.
1,This unit is terrible,"I've concluded that while they advertise heavily that this unit supports WPA-Enterprise with RADIUS, it does not. It doesn't even support WPA-Personal. Netgear says it has something to do with TKIP.Further, Netgear has the cheapest tech support for product that is at least somewhat known.Therefore, they sell you something full of lies and they don't provide support worth squat. I even tried ""level 2"" support and they weren't able to help me.Don't waste your money on this unit.I'm getting ready file a suit in civil court to recoup my loses from this product. (about a week and half from writing this review)"
1,Mistake!,"I purchased two of these units in December. This model seems to randomly stop routing traffic to the internet on random wireless attached computers (local network is fine). Three months later and numerous emails and phone calls to Netgear they sent me a replacement; SAME issues with the new model! Not all Netgear products are bad, this one is. Don't ever try to work with Netgear support, just not worth the stress."
1,put together too quickly and it shows!!!!!,"First of all, let me say that i think Billy Klippert should have been the Canadian idol. Buy his album as it is far more superior to this one in every way. Now, objectively speaking, i do believe Ryan Malcolm has a nice voice in its natural range, but at times Ryan is stretching it in this album. I believe most of the songs sound the same, and truly there is just not enough variety on this album, at times i feel like im listening to elevator music. I think if the producers took alittle more time constructing this album the result wouldve been alot better. Now i do think his release single ""something more"" is catchy, nice hooks and sentimental lyrics, but unfortunately its the only gem on this album. Buy the single and forget the album. I believe Canadian idol fans should give Billy's new album a try, YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!"
4,Great!,"Ryan Malcolms CD Is Great! I Love the songs Home, Ride, Your Heart Will Know, and Nothing Left To Say.Although I think it is great.. There are a few low points on the album (Straight Up The Middle, Don't Dream Its Over)I Think This Album would be alot better if it didnt feature Gary Beals.Although I love Ryan Malcolm to pieces, and wanted him to win Canadian Idol, I doubt he'll last one more year in the music industry."
3,Sherry0713,"You don't have to promote Ryan's cd by bashing Clay's and Ruben's. For your information and retention thereof....Clay is a far superior singer than Ryan and Clay's cd is great. Ruben is a good singer and although his style is different, he too can out sing Ryan. So promote all you want, but quit bashing to do it. Ryan's cd has some good songs, but alas the vocals are average."
2,HOME with no RANGE.,"Limited vocal range combined with lackluster material.Possibly the worst product to materialize from reality television. Is RYAN the nail that could shut down IDOL SHOWS ? Unfortunately, I doubt it !MALCOM's level of cheese on his solo debut does remain heavy. He makes CLAY AIKEN's solo sound semi-cool.With such as lackluster, dull and juvenile product, RYAN MALCOLM has hardly any hope of ever crossing borders to obtain his 15 minutes of international fame.Canadian teenyboppers across farm land in Ontario, Canada may appreciate his pre-fab geek lack of style, but serious music fans should beware, this HOME is a real BAD INVESTEMENT."
5,Fantastic Book-Fantastic Video,"Wow! I'd read the book-but watching the video was awesome. The story is awesome, spiritual and has such depth!Thanks, Mitch."
3,Curiosity,"Very fond of Mitch Albom's writings.Was not impressed with the book. I am more for truth, not fiction.Would not recommend."
2,Best parts are still in the book.,"I really enjoyed the book by Mitch Alborn but the movie was a great disappointment. The ethereal and heavenly experiences I had while enjoying the writer's skill was not present in the film. Perhaps it was the editing or the producing which stripped the story of all its power. Which ever, my advice is to not waste your money or time on this trite, shallow, drained attempt at capturing the wonder of a life renewed and saved. Enjoy the book."
5,We all need a second chance,Had read the book before watching the movie and was not dissapointed. A grat representation of a great book.
2,Predictable,"If you like movies where you read the back cover and can almost predict the entire screenplay, this one is for you. It is NOT a challenging film. Its a shame, because the premise of spending one more day with a deceased loved one is a potentially rich theme. However, this film makes no attempt to be anything more than entertainment suited for the lifetime channel. The attempts to tug on the heart strings are way too blatant and cheesy.There is one positive note, however. When you see Chick as a young ball player in the minor leagues and on the Mets, you should get a decent laugh. He looks absolutely ridiculous. The baseball scenes are some of the worst I have ever seen; so bad in fact its funny."
4,For one more day,"Great movie, bad casting. Pretty close to the book in events. I suggest you read the book first, then watch movie, to get vitual images. Author's other two books, where casted much better. Left me wanting to know why they picked this actor as the main character? Still, anything related to Mitch Albom is exception and true. Worth watching.Every adult child should read and watch this movie. Highlights a mother's selflessness love for her children."
4,Extrememly Helpful,"I found this extremely helpful. You can nit-pick the irrelevant factors, they use cartoons, the excerpts are dated but I sort of think they are going for a little retro flavor here. Yes, it may be a little on the low budget side. That being said, the key for me was all of the information that it provided. It explained all about turbulence, a huge issue for me. It explained just how thorough the airline industry really is, how everything is checked and double checked, how there are backup systems for everything. They go over alot of factors, it's an hour and 45 mins long. I would definitely recommend this for the fearful flyer. If you are looking for a viewing experience with award winning direction and oscar worthy performances, see Forrest Gump. If you are looking for information based help with your fear of flying, buy this dvd."
5,"It may not be easy to overcome fear, but this DVD will sure help!","You've may have heard the saying, ""Face your fear and do it anyway."" That sounds great but how do you take that first step toward ""doing it anyway""? This DVD is a fabulous tool for fearful flyers. The Captain helps us understand why we're afraid, how it affects us and what is really going on with the plane, the people, the weather and other factors. The basic principal is simple. When we know what's going on, we no longer feel the fear.The information is excellent and the participants are knowledgeable. The details are presented by professionals who are working in aviation every day and you really get the feeling that they care about the struggles of fearful flyers. The visuals really help you grasp the basics of flight and you'll be surprised how much confidence that gives you!"
1,The Human Factor = 1 star out of 5,"God, this episode was awful. Considering it had some nice plot twists (and some of the best in the series) and that it still stunk out the joint tells volumes on how bad The Human Factor was to watch. The episode invloves: a scientist, his love?, a pyscho soldier, a bunch of inept officers, awful/silly dialogue, a head-scratching plot, a nuclear bomb, officiers that arm nuclear bombs to show another person how it works(?), etc etc etc. This is one of the worse Outer Limits episodes.thank you for your time, David"
3,"Good Performances, Clever Story","Not OL's best by a long chalk, though the reviewer who commented on some critics being unduly harsh to it is well-stated. It's a good mid-level episode, with a lot to recommend it.Gary Merrill, Harry Guardino, and especially Sally Kellerman are worth the price of admission alone, but this entry has other attributes, as well. It's thick with claustrophobic atmosphere, has a good share of wit (the military base, TABU - ""Total Abandonment of Better Understanding"" - being just the beginning of it), and excellent suspense, with a genuinely clever ending. Unsettling implications of invasion of privacy, national security, and nuclear diplomacy are brought up.Merrill and Guardino do a really good job of alternately playing the nut-trying-to-pass-for-normal, and Kellerman was never more adorable in her life.Don't expect a masterpiece. Just a good, solid suspenser. Well worth a look-see."
4,A Beautiful Story,"An eloquent composition of a difficult time of dealing with death and many other challenges and emotions in life. A very talented writing that really brings the reader into the story. An easy read, the writing and story flow very smoothly. You won't want to put it down before you finish it!"
4,good for oil,"I bought 4 of these for various oils and vinegars in the kitchen. They are great. I wouldn't want something with thicker plastic--these have great drop-for-drop control. The red cap covers are a bit cheap and one came split, but otherwise they are fine. There are more durable bottles out there (I've used them), but I wanted control and these have them."
4,Pleantsly Surpised,"After initally writting Sammie off, he surpised with his sophmore CD. Sammie has matured as an artist and unlike other young R&B singers, Sammie is more concerned with soulful singing than being crunk in the club.With the involvement of Austin, Jazze Pha, Dre & Vidal, and Bryan-Michael Cox and very few cameo apperances this is one of the better R&B CD'S from a singer under 21. The album's first four tracks Feelin It,I Can't, You Should Be My Girl and What About Your Friend all me nodding my head. As far for the ballads Sammie really delivers on Misson Impossible and Slow, However Sammie is the strongest vocally on Another Last Chance which is very heartfelt with it's portrait of young love gone wrong. I honestly hope that the music buying public gives him a chance as he is a talnted singer and given the right production there's no telling how far he'll go."
2,lacker!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I DONT REALLY LIKE THIS ALBUM, MY SISTER BROUGHT IT AND SHE HATES IT. THE ONLY SONG THAT IS GOOD ON IT, IS BESIDES THE SINGLES IS ""BACK TO LOVE"".NOT A GOOD CD!"
5,algy bear comes to town,we bought algy bear to replace a little bear that disappeared and he is wonderful - he is squishy and cuddly and has an incredible sense of humour. he is also very good at math (algebra in particular).
1,Junk unless you are using it as a wall decoration!,"Flimsy and light construction, Image and words are inverted on the back side. OK if you plan to hang it on the wall, but tacky as flying flag. Item description claimed a value of over $45 dollars for the thing. I paid $12.48 for it and now they are listing it for over $16!...it's worth 8 bucks tops!McB"
5,Great Rockin Disc!,"Well I just got through listening to the whole disc and I'd have to say, beginning to end, this album rocks! The album is very well produced and sounds great. The drums hit hard and precise, the guitar crunches nicely, the bass drives and the vocals rock. Avoid One Thing has a very unique sound compared to most other bands in their genre and it really stands out. Definitely pick up this album, you will not be disappointed!"
3,Not compatible with new systems.,"I'm sure this is a great game, but I couldn't get it to work on my Mac. I always go to the manufacturer now to find out what games are compatible. Unfortunately, that doesn't include anything in this price range."
1,Spy Hunter not up to par,"Tested on a G4 MMDOS X 10.5 crashes at startupOS X 10.4 random crashes (no wheel support and neither of my 2 gamepads are supported)May have been great with a wheel and ok with the game pad, but the continuos random crashes bring this down. I was unable to locate and download any patches or updates with possible fixes.Aspyr has not support for this game on their website."
3,"Sweet ""Memories"" is an Appropriate Title","I've been a fan of Mannheim Steamroller for many, many years. I thoroughly enjoy their many Christmas albums -- the first two being the best. This one was purchased at a local drugstore (where I work) and while a few of the songs listed are new -- at least to me -- the majority are repeats from other albums. Even the 1984 one.Come on, Chip Davis. There is a multitude of holiday songs from which to choose. Why repeat oldies (but goodies) as opposed to putting together a completely new holiday collection?"
3,For completists,"Variations on arrangements of material generally released before, appear to be remixed and/or have elements of a more ""matured/reflective"" nature inserted into or rerecorded for most tracks. Very immediate digital sound that may overtax car stereos with its granularity. Interesting to listen to for changes over previous/concert arrangements until last 2 tracks: which plangently assault the ear to demonstrate why the track over button is on my remote control. Nonetheless good listening as a whole and could impress new listeners not expecting conventional carols."
1,Very annoying,"I just finished reading the other reviews and couldn't disagree more. I found Linet to be stupid and clueless. She betrays Duncan several times, even after she realizes that she is in love with him. I couldn't fathom why Duncan would care about her. Skip this one!"
1,Opinions rather than research,"Robinson contends that the superiority of Northern military manpower and industrial resources were not decisive in the defeat of the South, but that discord between slaves, poor whites, and the planter class was instrumental in its downfall. Pure rubbish, since Southerners of every color went eagerly off to War and fought to the bitter end while the slaves supported the troops in the field by working back home. Even though slave revolts could have brought the South to its knees, none occurred, much to the chagrin of Lincoln who hoped for such when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation. Don't waste your money."
3,Vista Sucks,"Nice Computer, only exception was the USB & Other plugs ALL on Sides, this was an issue for my desk space. I was unable to find work around for Vista operating system with my existing software, $600-$800 to update software! Power Supply died after 10 hrs. Amazon was GREAT ! Very Helpful, I recieved a full refund including shipping after the return.Solution; I found a refurbished Toshiba with XP.Vista is NOT Backward Compatible !!!! Quickbooks and Others would like to see us buy another upgrade."
1,Wish I could give it a negative star rating,"Toshiba Satellite models come at an attractive price, but that's about all I can say in their favor. My Satellite laptop has had 4 trips to the repair depot, the first one only one week after I bought it. That repair took almost a month, and failures have included 3 mother boards. Thankfully I bought the extended warranty. I called their customer relations dept. today to inquire about my options with an obvious lemon and was told they would only repair it again. The customer service rep. refused to let me speak to anyone else when I asked politely to speak to a supervisor, and when I asked for a phone number for their U. S. Headquarters said she didn't have that phone number.At least one Satelitte model has been the subject of a class action lawsuit due to the large number of failures; the resolution was simply to repair any models whose warranty had expired. I'd look elsewhere for a laptop."
5,Great Laptop after 14 months!,"I bought this laptop 14 months ago when it first came out. A friend bought an identical one at the same time. Mine has been a perfect running machine. His needed a new hard drive within 4 months & was replaced on warranty. Since then, his has been running perfectly, too. The only thing, if you are a gamer & want to put in a high perforance game card, then this is not the laptop for you. It was a great purchase for me."
2,"Clunky, dull writing","I couldn't get past the first few chapters--Davis's writing is a clunky, dull, infodumping example of why ""show, don't tell"" is one of the first rules of good writing. I found the sheer genius of the main characters kind of ridiculous, the dialogue implausible, and the portrait of university research life to be nearly unrecognizable (but I think that's because actual university researchers are generally too busy researching to write novels or screenplays, so Davis is no worse in this respect than any number of other authors out there).I was really disappointed, since I was hoping for a good story with science nicely woven in, and instead got a not-very-well-written science book with a story buried in it somewhere. There are better adventure books and better science books out there.Two stars instead of one because at least the science is fairly well-researched."
4,Witty and delightful.,"Garrett Forester, Earl of Whitshire, had a most unusual hobby. He collected murderers. He didn't need his beloved mother bringing guests to his London house while he was in the midst of another murder investigation. Yet he found Honor Virtue quite taking and truly liked her sister and brother. A lovely young runaway from the horse show complicates his life even more, as does objects mysteriously appearing in his house.Judith A. Lansdowne never disappoints. If you love humor with your romance and would rather your heroine and hero not be at each other's throats throughout most of the book, buy a Lansdowne. Whitshire is definitely a man of many talents who loves his life. There are two other romances and three mysteries to solve, not an easy task for an experienced author to keep straight. No worries, Lansdowne can do it."
5,"Excellent book, great characters, interesting story line.","Excellent book with characters you care about, and a good plot line. Main male character is calm and strong, with a good sense of humor and main female character is the same. Humor important with these two. Also, like subplots with other male and female characters. Everyone likeable and you care about all of the characters. Makes you want to investigate all of Lansdowne's other stories. Not sensual, but the characters are so lively that you can accept the lack thereof. Very good story. A keeper."
3,Stick with the studio versions,"Sylvian has said how much he dislikes performing live, calling it an uncreative process. I think this shows here. While live albums should give you a feeling of immediacy and spontaneity, Oil on Canvas sounds colder and more remote than the studio albums. The crowd sounds like it's a hundred miles away, and there are too many slow-tempo numbers (in accordance with Sylvian's preference);the album opens and closes on uninspired instrumentals. Also, there is no improvisation or variation on the studio tracks, which you might have expected from such great musicians. So you have in effect a rather uneven, slightly muddy sounding, compilation of greatest hits, minus ""my new career."" You're better off buying the 3 studio albums!"
3,"Good music, bad art","Hey, what more can you say about David and the boys? He's a genius with the voice of an angel. So what's up with that godawful album cover? Your usual abstract paint swirls that MIGHT have worked, but wait, some lamebrain had the bright idea to put A FACE, a normal, non-abstract FACE, smack dab in the middle, resulting in one of the STUPIDEST album covers of all time. Artist, what a bunch of dorks."
3,"Good, Don, but...","I actually enjoyed this book, as I did its predessor ""The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes"" So why only three stars? Well, there was the slight problem of me buying the same book twice UNDER DIFFERENT NAMES. YEAH, ""SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE VOICE FROM THE CRYPT"" IS THE SAME BLEEPING BOOK! And here I thought old Donsy had produced another gem for my collection. Alas, how easily we who are not experts buy paste at the price of diamonds. I'm dissipointed, man. The Raven says write some more and be careful about the titles! Quote me!"
2,Collar rips near top eyelets,"I have purchased two pair of these shoes, and each pair's collar ripped between 9 and 12 months of light use. I like the fit and styling, but can't justify buying a new pair every year. Good luck!"
1,Not durable,"These only lasted six months. The pleather started peeling off of the toes. The soles are a nice non slip, though."
2,Shoes,.bad... this shoes are not the best you feet still hurt its like getting the cheap version but you pay more for this than the other shoes... i wouold not recoment this shoes i would rather tell someone to go to the other store were you will get the same shoes for less...
3,correct size,"Well it is the correct size, quality and defiantly non slip shoes. Very water and chemical resistant which I need from day to day. I would of liked the heel in the back to be a little higher, because that's how my old sketchers were and based my buying off of those and I am breaking them in today but noticed a little heel irritation after I was on my feet all day. Of course, Most of these problems come from shoes half a size too big, but they fit tight which was weird maybe I just need thicker socks with these bad boys."
1,cheap dont buy,"When I bought these shoes, I also bought the best spray, leather shoe protectant I could find, and gave them several coats, in fact I used up the whole can because I manage a restaurant, and they do get fairly dirty. After every shift I would wipe them down with a damp cloth, and then a dry cloth. Well, to my dismay, AFTER TWO MONTHS, THEY BEGAN CRACKING AND PEELING ON THE TOP!!! I have to throw them away!! Is this real leather? WHAT A HORRIBLE WAIST OF MONEY! SKECHERS, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!! I ONLY WISH I HAD SAVED MY RECIEPT! DO NOT BUY THESE SHOES!!!"
3,too narrow for a not very wide foot,"I don't need wide shoes anywhere else, but these killed my 'normal' sized feet, caution. But they did seem to be otherwise comfortable and the best looking work shoe available. I ordered ""sketchers Galley wide"" in place of."
5,I agree... everything is excellant,"I won't (can't ;) go into a long technical review since others more qualified have already done so but I agree with everything I've read so far. Be sure to catch the tips on adjusting the out of box settings, very easy to do with ""quick setup"" when player first turns on. Also, any $15 HDMI cable works great. Plays all my burned DVD's so far: +/- R/W & DL+R/W. I have a mix of brands including Memorex, HP and Verbatim including lightscribe discs."
5,Better than expexted,"This DVD player is awesome. I was a little sceptical of my purchase do to the price, but the picture is better than I expected. I use this with a LCD tv. It works with HDMI and Optical out. I am using HDMI out for the Picture and Optical out for my Audio and works great."
1,region code problem,"This player is very picky on region code. I have many all region DVDs can play in JVC and other brands but cannot play in this player. Most VCDs cannot be played either. I have 3 popular brand dvd players before this one, this is the first time I see this problem. I don't know if this is a defect or not. If I bought this from a retail store, I would definitely return it."
4,Mostly pleased,"I mostly pleased with the DVD. The slow loading time can be annoying at times, but overall I am pleased."
4,Happiness is..............,"I am extremely happy with this unit and its price. I have a regular Sony DVD Player, which costed twice as much as this unit and is too sensitive to any disc dirt or slight imperfections in the recording and won't play some of them.This unit accepts and plays any dvd I put in it and the picture on my 55"" HDTV set in my living room entertainment center makes you feel like you are in a private movie theater. My 3 and 7 year old grandchildren I babysit for at my house after they get out of pre-school and 1st grade absolutely insist on watching movies using this equipment instead of the regular player and EDTV in my family room."
3,I found it average,"The picture quality is good with my Samsung flat screen. But really didn't see a noticeable difference using a HDMI cord as compared to less expensive DVD Players with component video. But it doesn't take a long time to unload, less than 30 seconds. One finally thing, have a problem where the zoom icon will not leave the screen under this mode. It's really annoying and the best Sony told me was to unplug the DVD player and try again. What a joke...any better suggestions?"
5,Very pleased!,"Player installed on TV in less than a minute with purchased cable. Good price, works great, very pleased!!"
4,Incredible picture! with one flaw on old DVDs,"The other effusive reviews are spot-on... the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter). A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job. We have the Sony KDF-42E2000 42"" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination. A few annoyances: The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price. And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat. I'm sure there's a solution, but just can't figure it out. Any tips?"
2,Not up to the expectation,This one is no better than normal component video out put. I tested this with my other DVDplayer with a component video out put on a 58 inch panasonic plasma. I could not make any difference between this player and that one.I strongly discourage some one who wants to see a difference between and component video output and a HDMI output. Infact this player does not play some of the R/W formats of DVD.
3,Don't believe the hype,"If you are expecting your DVD's to be magically transformed by this unit and appear as HiDef on your tv, you will be disappointed. I have a Sony Grand Wega 60"" LCD projection HDTV. My previous DVD player was a Sony DVP-NS315.I can find not one bit of improvement in the picture quality using this player. At least not enough to speak of. Having said that, the picture/audio is acceptable and for $114 plus the cost of an HDMI cable, this unit is not a bad way to go. Just don't get sucked into some of these reviews."
5,you got to have for home made dvds off tv etc-- a MUST have,"i have MANY home made dvds --from ioffer.com-sell.com etc, tv shows, to homemade dvds---the blu ray player(sony)has a problem with these-(now and then--not a continuous problem but irritating enough)-jump freeze etc-you have got to realize the blu ray player is a totally different system from that of a standard dvd player-the sony model i have(bdps470) wont let you adjust the color,hue etc at the player-it has no memory-it must be done on the tv which stinks--the remotes wont even work from one player to another(blu ray or reg dvd)-as sony remotes usually do---ive since got 4 on here as back ups-(the dvp ns 75h)-because you probably will never be able to buy a non blu ray player this good in the future--to me and others this is the finest dvd player sony ever made--so if you play a lot of non commercial dvds you better stock up on these--cause down the road you will be sorry when ONLY blu ray players are available"
4,Great upscaling DVD player,"Does as it states. Only downsides are that the load up times are a bit high and it doesn't play Divx, but then again... it doesn't state that it offers that feature.I have owned 2 of these players for about 8 months and have absolutely no complaints besides those above. Beautiful picture quality on my 1080i projection Hitachi 50' TV."
4,Good for the price,"Wider than I expected, but produces a good image and good audio. Looks very nice."
4,Sony DVPNS75H single disc upscaling DVD player,"This is a great DVD player.It is compact, it looks and plays EXCELLENT.The only thing I can say is, there is alot of buttons on the remote.It takes some study time to figure it out.Other than that, it is a top notch system."
5,As good as they come,"I had to replace my old DVD player because it simply couldn't handle the DVD-Rs that I have been collecting. You know the problems: freezing, gross pixilations, hanging - VERY annoying. I tried the worst disc I had, and this player played it flawlessly - you would never have known it wasn't ""perfect"". Another great but understated Sony feature is the player ""remembers"" where you left off on up to six discs. If you stop or eject a disc, the player will begin play at that point the next time you load it, with up to six different discs in between. The remote has better human factors than previous Sony models, too, so it's much easier to work in lower light levels. A superior value in every respect. If you are into DVD-R or RW, give this player a try."
5,Works great!,"This is a wonderful product. It does just what it's supposed to without any complicated setup. The HDMI output, converted to DVI for my 40"" LCD TV, is flawless. The upscaling gives excellent picture quality on lower resolution DVDs. Sleek, low profile design. Could not be happier with this product. Great price and value."
5,Great dvd player at a great price!,"Hello there!I purchased this sony upscaling dvd player to replace a sony progressive scan player that has served me well for the last 2 years. All I can say is WOW! The upgrade in picture quality is amazing. I have it hooked up to a 51"" sony rear projection CRT via HDMI cable and at 1080i it is as close to high def as you can get. Even my wife was impressed and that's really saying something. I would also like to comment on the alledged slow loading time for dvds. I have owned a phillips, a panasonic and the above mentioned sony and this dvd player loads as fast if not faster than any of them. If you are are in the market for an upscaling dvd player I highly recommend the sony DVPNS75H."
3,It's still standard definition in the end.,"I received this player as a christmas present since i bought a new TV on recently. it replaced another sony dvd player that was about 2 years old but still worked perfectly on the new TV with decent PQ. don't get me wrong, for the price this DVD player is a great bargain, but only offers a marginal enhancement in picture if you have a DVD player from a recent generation.After I connected this player via HDMI, i wasn't surprised to find similar PQ. after playing with different resolutions, i decided that 720p gave me the best looking picture, but only offered a marginal improvement over my old DVD player running 480p through component. i would only recommend this player to anyone who is replacing an old non-progressive scan player."
4,Big Improvement,"I recently purchased a new 60"" HDTV which was a good news bad news story. The HD picture looked great but my DVDs looked all blocked up even though I was using an expensive 2yr old dvd player. Out of desperation, I decided to try a new player, never thinking it would make much of a difference. But when I tried this player the improvement was huge and immediate. Nobody was more surprised than I was. A terrific add on that I can recommend without reservation."
1,died after 1 year,"Simply put its garbage after 1 year. I had purchased the Sony DVPNS75H to use with my Sony Bravia. At first I loved it, great picture but after a little over a year it stopped working. As others have reported here, after inserting a DVD it would display loading for several minutes and then eventually display can't play.I had purchased it to hold me over until the price of Blu-Ray players came down, it didn't even last long enough for that purpose. If it had lasted for two years I might of given it 4 stars but for just over a year... its gets 1 star from me.I am going to think very hard about buying another Sony dvd player again. Or at least factor in the cost of an extended warranty since their quality control is a failure."
5,"Great product, great price","This is the second one I've purchased this year. I love it! It is easy to set up, easy to use, and the picture quality is great! I have one set up through the HDMI cable on an HDTV LCD and the other one is set up through the basic cables on a rear projection HDTV. Both picture qualities are great! Highly recommend!"
4,A Very Good DVD,"I bought this upscaling DVD player to go with my new Sony 40"" XBR2 and it delivers an excellent picture, as good as the HD picture delivered by my Comcast cable HD receiver. It was easy to connect and the set up menu was easy and brief. My only complaint is that for a DVD player that is specifically marketed to connect to an HD T.V. it DOES NOT come with an HDMI cable, an extra $[...] at Radio Shack for a 6' cable. If the product description had been clear that the cable was not included I would have bought the 70H model at my local Costco, which included an HDMI cable, for $120.00. Even with tax it would have been less expensive than this model and would deliver the same picture with movie DVD's. Otherwise I would have rated this product with 5 stars."
5,the best,"Buy this upconverting dvd player, i use it on my lcd tv using HDMI cable, one of the best things is it last unlike the 3 panasonic s-77 that i owned,the optical block that the laser sits on gets stuck for me anywhere from 6 months to as little as 30 days on the panasonic,this is a great player and is probly the simplist to set up properly,buy this until blue ray or HD dvd gets less expensive."
1,Sounds stops in middle of movie!,"Most of the time im pretty unhappy with the results of the upscaling on my 40"" samsung and then just 3months into owning the player my sound started cuting off about ever hour or so into the movie.You most eject the desk to get it working right..Pain!!"
3,Picture splits,"I recently bought this Sony DVPNS75H Single Disc Upscaling DVD Player & hooked up to my digital TV using the HDMI cable. While playing the DVD, the picture on the screen splits in two parts & then again become one. Doesn't matter what DVD you are playing, it can be brand new commercial DVD or the DVD created on a PC. It only happens once in a while. I also have a 4 yr old Sony player which now skips & freezes the DVD. So I am worried about this new DVD player. Lately I didn't have much luck with Sony products. I have three Sony CD players at home & none of them are working."
2,"I got a ""lemon"" dvd player","This is my first Sony purchase that was defective straight out of the box. I've owned Sony TV's and cameras, and they have worked wonderfully. I've purchased this upscaling DVD player for my HDTV. Was I disappointed when it would not accept ANY of my region 1 DVD's that my other DVD players would accept with no problems. The Sony display says ""cannot play this disc."" I've tried Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Aladdin, Incredibles, none worked. I'm returning it to Amazon. I just got a lemon."
1,Sony quality going down the tubes,"I bought this unit in August 2006 to replace my prior Sony DVD player (DVP-NS715P), which had conked out due to a faulty drive mechanism after four years. The 75H worked great for five months, but then was suddenly unable to play discs. After disc insertion, the display would say ""loading"" for several minutes and then finally say ""can't play disc"". This was basically the same problem I had with the first player. I opened up the unit to investigate, and saw that the disc wouldn't even spin after the tray was inserted. I tried several discs to no avail. Again, this was clearly due to a faulty drive mechanism and was the same problem I had with the 715P. I have little interest in buying another Sony DVD player. Brand-new electronics from such a reputable brand should not fail at this rate."
3,Alright but no real range for a 5.8 Ghz,"The phone has a couple of good features. But is missing some notable ones from its predecessor, like speaker phone. The phone has great difficulty with ranges greater than 2 to 3 rooms away, which should be handled with ease. Pay less than $40 and the phone is worth it- otherwise, give it a big PASS!"
3,It's just ok.....,"Well, the phone was at least a really excellent price because I got it with a great offer. I intended to wall mount this phone. When I got it and tried to put it on the wall with the wall mount, it stuck out so much further than my other phone and I just couldn't leave it there. So, now I have no phone on the wall where one should be and it now sits on a table. It does not work very well when I walk outside of the house like my old Uniden still does. I can walk into my back yard with the Uniden. This phone, I can just open the door and step outside before it starts to fade. The answering machine is annoying. I really don't need to hear the date and time, every time I replay a message. It takes too long to review that way. I just don't like it compared to my former answering machine. The bottom line is that I only kept it because of how cheap it was. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Reprint of a much sought book,"This is a softcover reprint of a book that created a big stir when it originally came out. You could call it a portrait of young men of ""the Zurich scene of Pfeiffer's friends hanging out in the studio"" with a definite leaning towards the erotic."
1,As worthless as the book,"This manual only solves the problems listed in orange in the book and it solves them very briefly, to the extent that it is still difficult to follow. I did not care for the book and had trouble using it to solve any of the exercises in the back of each section. As a result, I bought the solutions manual hoping to shed some light on how to solve these exercises. However, the manual did no such thing to alleviate this problem; certainly not $30 worth of help. Not a recommended buy, you're better solving the problems using other math texts."
4,Only useful becuase the textbook is bad.,"My title says it all. The text book that goes along with this is absolutely horrible. This book is also really bad, however becuase you will need all the help you can get I have to recommend this book. Why is this book bad? Well like the textbook this book is very confusing. The book constantly skips steps and assumes you actually know the material (which you wont). Like I said, if you are taking a class that requires the text book then you really need to buy this since it will be the only source of help you are going to get."
1,...,"I don't understand why the author only provided less than 10 problems from each section. seriously, provide more!!! that would help so much. Oh, while at it, try to make the explanations more beginner friendly!!! experienced students don't need this book, most beginners do!!!"
1,This book is a joke,"Don't bother. If you think the text book is cryptic and are hoping to find something to help you through it, you are sorely mistaken if you think this is the answer. Actually shocked someone actually published this. The textbook has answers in the back to various questions at the end of each chapter. Well guess what, this study guide only expands upon the answers the text book provided. Does that really make sense? If you are really looking to add value, maybe perhaps the authors should have thought about answering and explaining all the questions (though that would make the assumption that they could actually provide answers that the text book doesn't). If you are having trouble with the book and the material, pass on this study guide and pay 10 times the cost with a person tutor, you will be better off."
3,Wish I didn't buy it,This thing skips steps and doesn't show many solutions. The book seems to only show the easy problems and isn't to great at getting you going. Although not perfect cramster is more useful than this book.
3,my review of gunstar hero,definately the classic as i was told but a little harder to start playing then i thought. if you're looking for a 2 player might want to try something else as throwing friends/enemies becomes is annoying. single player though it's a great metal slug style sidescrolling shooter.
3,Solution to droop problem,"I recently purchased this arm for my iMac G5. I had the same problems as other reviewers, the monitor drooped and I could not adjust the tilt. I figured out that the reason for this is the low quality screws that omnimount provides you with. I went to the hardware store and purchased new, heavy duty screws, which I swapped with the other ones that were included on the arm. Also, make sure that you are using washers with the ""pivot shaft screws"" so the screws do not come out whenever you tilt the monitor. After doing this, the arm worked. My computer did not droop anymore. Other than the low quality screws, I found the arm to be very good."
1,Horrible - O stars is my actual rating but doesn't exist on this site.,The mount is unable to hold my 17 inch LCD without tilting. I have followed the manufactures advise on how to prevent this from happening and it does not work. After only 2 months I am now going to have to buy another TV mount. Don't waiste your money on this product.
4,Almost excellent,This mount is nicely designed and well-made; it fit the TV perfectly. Our only criticism is that the screws provided for attaching it to the wall were of poor quality. The heads stripped out right away and it took a trip to the hardware store to get replacements.
5,"Best mount out there, bought for 50% less on Amazon","This mount is great, it allows you to mount your TV on the wall flat, then pull it away from the wall and turn it nearly 45-degrees in either direction as well as tilt it up and down. Very secure. You must mount into a stud in the wall, so you will have to have a stud-finder and a drill. I got a stud-finder for $10 at Lowes."
4,Other Consideration,"I was considering buying this product. However, based in part upon the reviews, I choose the ""Premier Mounts' AM2 Swingout Arm for 17""-40"" LCD Displays"", sold through Amazon. I am very pleased with that mount. If you are considering this product, you may want to look at that mount before you make a final decision on which one to buy."
4,very nice music,"I wasn't terribly familiar with jesse cook's music, other than the odd track on some compilations, but ""frontiers"" is very enjoyable. Sadly, the only weak track that seemed a little out of place and contrived was the Bob Dylan cover of ""It Ain't Me"". Covers can be cool but this one just didn't do it for me. Aside from that, it is a very worthwhile addition to my collection."
4,A very good guitar music CD,"I have all of Jesse Cook's music (except his Montreal CD which was just a live performance of some of his music). He's a great musician (I also have seen him live, and plan to see him again in July 08). As to the CD, if you have heard his music, you will like the CD. It's a little fast in a couple of songs, and there is some actual singing on one song (Spanish), but mostly it is guitar music with nice background percussion and occasionally some string instruments. He's a innovative musician (with a sense of humor) that has created an easy going, pleasant background music (I pick and choose some of his music for massage background music). In sum, it's an excellent CD, but I will admit I am slightly biased. I'm not sure if I would label his music as adult alternative or new age."
5,Frontiers,"This was the first CD I got from Jesse Cook. I would hear his songs on the radio, but they never said his name or the name of the song. One day they said it was ""Jesse Cook"". Then I was on a mission to find out the name of the song I would hear. I named it my ""Happy Song"". I finally called the radio station and found out it was ""Cafe Mocha"" So I went to Amazon to find a CD. There it was Frontiers."
3,Acceptable Not Impressive.,"After listening to the whole album more than 5 times, I have found it to be acceptable not impressive.On the positive side, this album has the same shade as the first two released by Mr. Cook. I personally liked Rain, Europa, and Alone (3 out of 13).On the other side, this album contradicts its title ""frontiers"". No limists were pushed on this album, It should been properly titled ""back home""."
3,"review of jesse cook's cd ""frontiers""","prior to buying jesse cook's cd i had purchased all of his previous cd's. in my opinion ""frontiers"" is the least desireable. not that it is bad,it just does not reach the high standard heard on his other cd's. they were outstanding ' this one is avereage."
5,The entire CD ROCKS!,"I defy anyone to sit still while listening to Matisse The Cat! I usually buy MP3's by the cut because I don't like an entire CD, but this one? I bought them ALL! It's really unusual for me to like every single cut. Jesse we want MORE MORE MORE! :)"
5,Excellent!,"Like all of Jesse Cook's albums, this one is excellent! Though this might be his best one to date!"
5,jesse cook,music - wonderful music from jesse cook...have seen him live in concert...love his music...great addition to his collection of flamenco
4,Superior talent!,"Jesse is very talented, and I like several of the songs on this album. The best part of it is his guitar playing, not necessarily the arrangements. Cafe Mocha is the best track."
2,OK for the guest bathroom,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap. The material is cheap, the packaging is cheap (no instructions or template for towel bar. In addition the Drywall anchors included are worthless. Nice to look at now that is'a ll up, but it certainly wouldn't last long in a heavily used bathroom."
5,Beautiful and powerful,"I hear echoes of Puccini, Hanson and Barber. So, did Nicolas Flagello have a completely ""authentic"" voice? Well, perhaps not-but who cares when music like this is so emotionally satisfying, as well as well-constructed. The mid-twentieth century ideological constraints of serialism, atonality and dissonance are nowhere to be found. Flagello's music is late romanticism but tinged with some unique harmonic and chordal structures that make it evocative and distinctive. That's not to say I am going to throw out my Schoenberg, Sessions or Elliot Carter, but this is very wonderful music. The recording is quite atmospheric, and the orchestra, conductor, and soloists are very committed."
2,GREAT GAME,"AFTER SO MANY YEARS I STILL PLAY THIS GAME AND HAVE FUN WITH IT. I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS LITTLE AND HAD TROUBLE FINISHING THIS GAME, ESPECIALLY WITH THE PART OF THE RIDDLE OF THE SPHINX. EVEN THOUGH I LEARNED THIS GAME MANY YEARS AGO, I STILL PLAY IT, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T GET ANYTHING BACK BUT THE SATISFACTION OF WINNING AND SPENDING A GOOD TIME. IT'S A GOOD GAME TO PLAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF YOU HAVE TIME AND LIKE TO HAVE FUN."
4,Additional parts far too expensive!,"I've had mine for a good two years and find it most handy, but looking into the prices of extra work-bowls, lids and blades, they are extremely overpriced and for a set of above, one could buy a whole new machine! Shame on this gouging CUISINART!"
5,I Love This Little Thing,"I had never really gotten on the food processor bandwagon. I had bad experiences with older, larger food processors that either liquified things I was chopping, yet still left large chunks behind. Add in the time to get the appliance out, find place on the counter, and then clean it afterwards, and I could do a faster, better job with a sharp knife.Then I came upon this little beauty. It's small enough that I can leave it on the counter all the time. It has fewer pieces, and can be cleaned almost as fast as a cutting board and knife.The capacity is small, but if I'm just cooking for a couple people, it's plenty big for most chores.It works so well that I've ventured back into my appliance closet, and pulled-out the full-sized food processor for some things I wouldn't have bothered with before. In otherwords, this little device has changed the way I cook by expanding my choices of techniques to use.I really think this little thing is an indispensible aid in the kitchen."
5,I love using this little mini-prep food processor,"Considering that I love to cook so much, I have been needing some sort of food processor for a long time to cut the time of chopping certain foods like garlic and parsely. I incidentally fell upon this item on my excite.com webpage and immediately had to have this small food processor.Although small, the mini-prep food processor is ideal for someone like me who lives in a small apartment. I don't mind if I have to chop my garlic into smaller pieces before putting them into the processor. The results comes out great when I mince the garlic in the processor. I would have never gotten the garlic as finely chopped as the mini prep food processor did. The same can be said about chopping parsely. I love using the cuisanart mini-prep food processor."
1,Cuisinart Mini-Prep Food Processor,Came non-working. Cuisinart needs to do a better job reconditioning these.
1,IT DOESN'T WORK,BOUGHT THIS IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE EVERYTHING I HAVE BOUGHT BEFORE WAS GREAT AND IT WAS A NAME BRAND. GOT IT IN SEPT. WITH EXPECTATIONS OF USING IT FOR THE HOLIDAYS. IT DOESN'T WORK AND NOW I NEED TO USE IT AND DON'T HAVE TIME TO SEND IT BACK FOR A REPLACEMENT.
3,price is right,"+. strong motor; grinds chicken well in bursts+. simple and satisfying controls-. slippery; hard to remove the blade and bowl when wet-. too small to make a meallarger model of same design is far more versatile, but (...) the price is right. a good 'first cuisinart'"
1,VERY QUIET...DOESN'T TURN ON????? YES IT DOES!,"You would think that before sending a reconditioned unit out for shipping, someone might try turning it on. I notice I am not the first one to get a totally none working unit. What can I say!There is just no excuse. At least Amazon will take it back, but I am very reluctant to give it another try even though it is absolutely adorable. EDIT: I GOT MY REPLACEMENT TODAY. IT WORKS PERFECTLY. ONCE, WHEN I PUT THE LID ON, ALTHOUGH IT WAS SECURE, IT STILL DIDN'T TURN ON. THEN IT DAWNED ON ME (DUH!) THE LITTLE PLASTIC PIECE THAT STICKS OUT ON THE LID IS SUPPOSED TO SLIDE INTO A SLIT IN THE BACK OF THE PROCESSOR. YES, IT'S THERE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK UP TROUBLSHOOTING ""THE MOTOR DOESN'T TURN ON"" IT DOESN'T MENTION THIS PROBLEM. SO I GUESS I HAVE TO TAKE BACK ALL MY NEGATIVE COMMENTS. IT WORKS FINE IF YOU FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!"
1,Didn't work.,"I was interested, but concerned, about purchasing a factory reconditioned item, so I decided to try it on a small scale. The mini food processor arrived in a timely manner and was very clean. But no matter what I did, I couldn't get it to work -- absolutely no power, no movement, no nothing. So, I returned it the next day. I don't think I'll take a chance on ordering another factory reconditioned item."
5,Perfect for small batches,"I use this all the time to chop up nuts, grate hard cheeses, and make small batches of hot sauces. Works well when you don't want to pull the full sized food processor out and assemble it and then clean it afterward. It'll chop a good sized onion up to start a pasta sauce, or a couple of hot peppers for a finishing to a stir fry. Very handy and pretty well built even for couple time per week usage year after year."
1,great while it lasts!,"that is the problem! I bought 3 of these, one for ourselves and 2 as gifts. Everyone loved them but not one of them lasted more than 3 months of occasional use.Why would they want to put their reputation and good name on such a piece of garbage?"
2,I guess you get what you pay for,"I still haven't found one of these mini-choppers that really does that job right, so don't expect that this is simply a mini version of a real Cuisinart food processor.I had an even cheesier version of one of these, a noname brand from Walmart, and I'd hoped that the Cuisinart brand was going to be a big improvement. Unfortunately, while better, it still suffers from some of the same problems: the blade dulled quickly and food tends to twirl around inside the bowl without falling down onto the blades as in a full-size food processor. The dull blades mostly just beat up the food, and you'll have a helluva time acheiving fine mincing. And because the two switches are not latching types, you have to hold down the switch for the entire (excessive) time needed to fully process the food.On the plus side, the top fits tightly while processing and the unit is fairly easy to clean. But don't expect it to fully mince 3 cloves of garlic..."
2,Quality Control ?,"Looked good coming out of the box but as soon as I started to unwrap it, I smelled burnt plastic. Then I noticed small chips of black plastic in the wrapping materials. Sure enough there are pieces of something rattling around in the base and it does not even turn on. Back it goes for more ""refurbishing""."
5,No better literature regarding this famous fire equipment,"The author has gone to great lengths to cover all aspects ofthis once warrior of the fire service. The book has a fabulouswealth of information and the photos are superb. Whether you area fire buff or a firefighters like myself, you will find no other book that covers the bygone era of the Crown Firecoach."
5,Works exactly as advertised.,This product absolutely stopped my bed frame from rolling on the ceramic tile floor. This product really works and is well worth the small cost.
4,"Easy to use,good cost","These met the needs to keep iron bed frame from scratching and sliding on hardwood floor...great delivery, excellent cost as usual ."
4,Used under a piano,"I bought these castor cups to use under an upright piano on a new wood floor. My main concern was dispersing the weight of the piano so that the metal castors would not dent the wood. This product seems to do the job.In hindsight, however, I probably would have bought the bigger ones to disperse the weigth further."
5,Good grief it works!,"After years of anti-slide products that didn't work and a bed that often wandered as far as the neighbors yard, I was very skeptical about this product. However I am pleased to report that it works very, very well. Too well as getting the last one on proved difficult since the bed simply couldn't be slid around any more! Highly recommended."
3,Decent price,"Product was brand new in shrink wrap and the price was decent. However, CD case was cracked when item arrived."
1,hardly representative of the 90s,"has anyone else noticed that there isnt a single nirvana song? of all of the bands of the 90s, nirvana was undoubtedly one of the more luminary bands. and yet they appear nowhere on this compilation. instead, we are treated to the worst of the consumerist, disposable pop trash the 90s had to offer. a retrospective album should do more to cover the diverse styles of music that were prevalent at this time, but this album falls short in every aspect."
1,Ew!,"This is the worst game. I guess the first Galaxy Force game was so good it warrented a sequel. I'm not kidding when I say I made games better than this in 10 minutes on my old Commodore 64.I just unearthed this rubbish today after doing a little spring cleaning. I remembered it being trash but just needed to play it a little to jog my memory as to why. Basically, all you do in this game is fly thru a '3-dimensional' generic space level shooting things. You never miss. Even if you are in the top right or bottom left firing in the wrong direction, whatever boring weapon you have will eventually kill the non-threatening baddies. There's no story, just shooting.And the graphics are horrible. On the first level when you 'penetrate the enemy fortress' the worst graphics ever make an appearance. Ugh! It was horrid. To think that the RRP of this game was 39.99 when it was first released. I'm glad I never bought it. It just sort of appeared in my house. Trust me, it really is rank!"
2,Okay item,"I was surprised to see the coaster has a smaller diameter than my cupholder, so it moves around in there. I have a 2006 MINI Cooper S, and I used this for the movable cup holder that sits on the dashboard pillar.My 2 biggest issues - when using a cup with a plastic bottom (like Starbucks reusable clear cold drink cup), if you hit a bump, there is a loud crack when the cup lands back on the coaster.Also, a few times I have picked up the cup and the coaster was stuck to the bottom. I thought the whole idea was that the coaster absorbed the condensation, but the eject one seems to have a shiny surface that might interfere with that.I would not really recommend this - at least not for my model car."
1,Never got my coaster,"I never received the coasters. They refunded me but I really wanted the coaster, not the refund."
2,Very incomplete book,"I do not rate this book highly because it is incomplete and lacking in objectivity. For example, it does not have any information on the status of religious freedom in such countries as Canada and Australia. When discussing freedom in the USA, the author does not mention major ocurrances of religious hatred and discrimination such as the suppression of Native American spirituality, mob murder of Mormons in the early years of the LDS church, anti-Catholic riots of the 19th century, and present-day lynching, firebombing and threats which victimize Wiccans and other Neopagans.I would suggest a rewrite that would include more countries, and would treat all countries with greater objectivity."
3,Missing Vital Information,"As a huge car buff interested in all types of cars, I was thrilled when I first saw this book on Amazon as a quick reference for all those office debates about cars. The problem is, the book is missing some of the most vital information: horsepower and torque for all available engines, braking distance, 0-60. I realize the book has the potential, then to be twice as thick, but I would rather do away with some of the information in the front for usable information about each of the cars. If you're looking for the ""ultimate car guide"", stick to the web. I did like the tow ratings for each of the cars, though..."
5,Oh...the past~!,This was shipped in a very timely fashion....and a blast into the past. Lots of great pictures of people my husband and I remember ....and we learned a lot of things of interest about their lives. Unseen pictures to us....a happy purchase.
3,Practicality vs Durability,"It is really great having the large strainer suspended over the sink but I am not impressed with the cutting board. It is rather small and seems flimsy due to its dependence on the expandable metal rods that support the basket and board. It is OK for small items that don't require much force to cut through them but I wouldn't want to slice a Rheutabaga on this board. If I were to redesign this one I would beef up the suspension system and have the cutting board cover the entire strainer with a 4"" X 4"" opening to have access to the strainer when cutting veggies."
2,WOW...i thought i was the only one!,I just happened to come across this item. I've owned this blender up until recently...I thought I had done something wrong when my blender starting smoking and burning up. I too had the same problem w/ the black plastic assembly breaking in half and melting. It was however excellent up until that point (1 yr. minimal usage). At $20 it might be worth the risk...at full price..STAY AWAY!!
2,Black Motor clutch split in two,After only having this blender for a year (which I LOVED) the black motor clutch split into two pieces right down the middle. I was furious as this... blender should have a longer life than 11 months!...
1,Not So Good!,"I really liked this blender until the second day I was using it and the clutch assembly shattered. It didn't melt and burn like other reviewers experienced but it most definately was broken. I contacted Cuisinart and aside from sending it to them at my own cost, I can get the replacement part... I still haven't done it and it's been several months. It sits on my counter as a very expensive container for tea bags.Don't buy it - it's a waste of time and money."
1,Don't Buy IT!,This blender worked fine for about 20 uses then the black spinning piece stopped spinning and smelled out so we can't use it. Very expensive mistake. I bought it new. Don't buy it used!
5,Am I one of the lucky ones?,"I purchased the reconditioned model and have had NO problems. I have used it everyday for 5 months for smoothies, and it still runs beautifully!"
1,Wish I had read the reviews!,Yup - this product is faulty! The black gear piece on the base which rotates the blending blades broke on my blender - and I don't use it that often. I really expected more from Cuisinart. To top it off - I phoned customer service at Cuisinart to get the $2 replacement piece and they gave me the run around. They won't sell you the easy to replace part - you have to send the unit to them for repair which is nearly the cost of replacing the darn thing. My blender is less than a year old and I thought it to still be under warranty - but no! The 3 yr warranty is effective from date of manufacture - so if your unit has sat on a shelf before purchase - kiss that warranty goodbye! This experience has given me a bad taste for Cuisinart products.
1,Shame on Cuisinart!,"Cuisinart is suppose to mean quality, but for this seriously flawed product it does not. The company knows it and refuses to fix an easily fixable design flaw that rendures what should have been a great product a real dud!! Like many other reviewers here I too have had the black plastic drive clutch break, shatter actually in my face. Luckily I wear glasses or I would have sustained a serious eye injury. Two of the pieces bounced off of my eye glass lenses. Don't buy this product until Cuisinart repairs the problem. Your blender may work for a while but it is just a matter of time before it breaks. It does work great when it works, but it will die before its time. What a poor business decision by this company to risk their good name in this way!"
1,What A Surprising Waste,I had nothing but good things to say about my Cuisinart Food Processor. So naturally when I bought the blender I was under the same impression that Cuisinart makes a good product. Was I mistaken. I too experienced a problem after three times of use. The black plastic piece that allows the blades to spin broke into pieces. Trying to get Cuisinart customer service on the phone is impossible. Stay away and don't waste your time on this product.
2,Disappointing.,"Had problems similar to others with the black gear in the base that turns the blender. Had this piece break after about 8 months of infrequent use. Mailed the base away to Cuisinart Service and had it fixed ..., as it was under warranty... In comparison with the Kitchen Aid, which has a hard rubber gear instead of a plastic one, this product seems flawed. I've also had a Waring for 20+ years without any problems whatsoever.The blender does work well when it is working though. The capacity is good, but it does not pour well. Cleanup is fairly easy, although there is a separate gasket to help seal the blade assembly to the blender jar - on the Kitchen-Aid, the gasket is built into the blade assembly, which seems to make more sense - less parts to lose/break.I bought the Cuisinart based on the 11-cup food processor, which has been great. I also have a Cuisinart 4-slice toaster that has been fine. The blender just does not seem to be on a par wit these..."
1,A Real Disappointment Not to Mention a Waste of Money,"I received this item last Christmas as a gift from my daughter. I was delighted the first time I used it, as it seemed well designed and very sturdy. I used it four or five times since. Just today I attempted to use it and I was disappointed to find the black plastic rotater gear split in two. I immediately attempted to purchase this part only to find the part unavailable at the Parts and Services division of Cuisinart. What a disappointment, not to mention a waste of my daughter's money."
3,A Solid Work,"""A Righteous Cause"" is a very solid study of the life of ""The Great Commoner"". Prof. Cherny presents a very fair and balanced view of his life and the events that he played a role in. I recommend this to anyone with a desire to know more about the extremely important figure from the turn of the 20th Century. Sadly there is not a good rendering on Bryan's life. Nothing that I've found lifts this obviously charismatic person off the page. I've found good brief bios in various books, but no master work yet."
1,Never Worked!,"Received this item brand new. Still sealed in the package. Soon as I installed it in the controller. It said it was corrupt and would not save. Bad out of the box. Save your money and your time, don't purchase this item."
5,More than just Power Yoga,"I heartily agree with the previous reviews that praise Beryl Bender Birch's newest book. After reading Power Yoga I felt extremely inspired to start and continue practice of asana postures...but this book surpasses the postures described in detail in Power Yoga. Beyond Power Yoga: 8 Levels of Practice for Body and Soul, is truly the continuation of the Astanga practice for those yogi's who wish to improve their health physically and mentally. BBB reviews the postures described in Power Yoga and continues into an in depth description of the connections between the physical practice and the movement of prana through the chakras. She also discusses the history and progression of yoga in a direct and interesting manner. I highly recommend this book to both beginners and advanced yoga practicers because the author makes sure to cover all levels of Astanga yoga in a challenging but reassuring manner. This book provides pure motivation for the Yoga enthusiast!"
5,Beyond Power Yoga,"I am greatly impressed by Birch's new book, ""Beyond Power Yoga."" I feel that she has managed to distill all of her experience and teaching skills into an incredibly well written text that is both very enjoyable to read and also very inspiring and personally challenging. Usually sequels are not as good as the original, but ""Beyond Power Yoga"" is an outstanding exception. I feel that it is truly an uncompromisingly honest piece of work."
2,no more stories! please!,"Birch once again gives us more information about herself than is needed. Check out Donna Farhi's ""Yoga: Mind, Body and Spirit"" for a more thorough examination of the subject matter without all of the self-important jibber-jabber."
5,Very good,"Cyborg Justice is one of my favorite games on the genesis. While not quite as large as some other games, the gameplay is extremely fun. While you start out by designing your cyborg picking through a few different parts, you can change its body later by ripping parts off of your still living enemies and attaching them to yourself. Great funn ripping off a boss's arm and then trying to rip off his torso (killing him), only to have him rip off your arm instead."
1,I have two names for Michelle.....,"..... Abu Sayaf and the Moro Liberation Front. These are two radical and dangerous Islamic groups based in the southern islands of the Phillipines. Both groups have openly spoke of their desire to war with American forces. Both groups have attacked and kidnapped Americans and other Westerners. Both groups have attacked civilian areas with explosives and gunfire. So if one of these jihadist organizations were to attack America, would Mrs. Malkin own up to her beliefs? Would she recognize that, as a person of Filipino stock, she would fit the case for internment? Would she march herself off to an internment camp?"
1,"Xenophobic, hypocritical and full of hate...","The only reason to purchase this book is to prove, once and for all, that Michelle Malkin is a raving xenophobic lunatic. Michelle twists the facts and creates a ""reality"" that only members of hate groups could love. Everyone behind this book should be ashamed of themselves. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the book becomes mandatory reading for neo-Nazis. Michelle has now proven that she will write anything for a buck. The arguments are sophomoric, which is no surprise (Michelle would have trouble writing the crossword puzzle on the back of a box of Fruit Loops). The book is fueled by nothing but hatred, fear and contempt. It's a book written for bigots and cowards, and the whole thing is tragic."
1,"War on ""Terror"" becomes a war on the ""Other""","Come on. I seem to remember a certain terrorist attack in Oklahoma being perpetrated by a decidedly white guy from Middle America. Terrorists aren't a race, they are an ideology. And I for one will be thankful when we have an administration capable of fighting ideas with ideas.Malkin and those of her ilk need to realize that hate can come from everywhere and that Islamic terrorists are only one of a growing number of contingents that are violently angry at America's hubris."
1,Stunningly awful,"To call this ""crap"" would be an insult to crap. Just another right-wing shill for the Republican party inflicting their slime upon us. Her recent verbal beatdown on HARDBALL was hilarious."
1,Complete BS,There is no 'case' that can be made for the injustices that happened. Hopefully we have learned from the lessons of the past.
3,In Defense of Internment,"MICHELLE MALKIN researches the internment of individuals who were interned in camps during WWII. We can agree or disagree against this policy, but one can see that America may be faced with making this hard decision in the future. Which AMERICANS could find themselves interned in the future will depend on the next MAJOR attack that America receives. As sad as that seems....we have not changed that much.....and America will eventually defend herself...regardless of what is not politically correct at the moment."
5,Speaks the truth,"In this age of political correctness, it's refreshing to read another point of view. As she points out, of the first 31,000 rounded up on the west coast 16,000 were Japanese. Of those 16000 about 5632 immediately renounced their US citizenship and asked to be deported to Japan. How would you feel if FDR's govt left the Japanese dual citizens on Terminal Island, CA or Bainbridge Island, WA and one of the dual citizens sent word that a troop transport ship was leaving the harbor with 10,000 or 15,000 troops headed out to the Pacific past Japanese submarines. My guess is that some of the liberals evaluating this book would never have a chance to be born! To believe otherwise would be to assume FDR was a bafoon or stupid."
1,Intern Ms. Malkin,"""Women have 71% more accidents than men per mile driven."" According to Ms. Malkin's logic, she poses a greater statistical danger to the population than her male counterparts. Dare I say intern Ms. Malkin? This book was obviously written for the shock value of the idea, not because of any profound belief on her part."
2,"Nice Try, but no cigar","There is nothing new in this work, except the slant.Is there no end to the subjects our current crop of political ""gimmick"" writers will spin to advance their agenda and sell books?Ms. Milkin and her mentor,Daniel Pipes and her own Jewish husband who works for the infamous Rand corporation should worry a little bit about suggesting that we profile groups as spies worthy of interrment....they could quickly find their own getting the evil eye these days.There is a University of North Carolina professor who has done excellent work on this subject....sorry, his name excapes me, but you can probably google the subject and find him.Skip this one unless you already think we should put all the Muslims away because we are at war."
4,Book report,This book by Michelle Malkin was a very good review of history during world war 2 regarding the relocation of Japanese from the west coast. It is very accurate and well researched.
1,"RACIAL MENTALITY OF A LILLIPUTIAN ASIAN, WHITE WANNE-BE","Michelle Magalang Malkin,as a matter of fact is Asian/Filipina, a trying-hard Caucasian wanna-be with a Lilliputian racial mentality undeserving of any attention. She's a self-loathing, immigrant- bashing poor soul. In the Philippines there is a saying that goes: ""Ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinangalingan, ay di makakarating sa paroroonan""-Transalation: Someone who doesn't look back to her roots will never get to her destination. Don't waste your money!"
2,Off-base,"Both Malkin and her detractors are missing the point: there is no comparison between Japanese-American internment and racial profiling of terror suspects today. Pearl Harbor was committed by a miltary force on a military force, by a country whose people are known for honorable conduct. 9/11 was committed by infiltrators living within the United States with no loyalty to any particular country against civilians, by a group who, since 1979 have committed many such deeds."
2,. . . condemned to repeat it.,"I have assigned this book to some of my classes so the students can see how the past can be manipulated. Taking advantage of the ignorance of some, the bigotry of others, and zealousness that passes for patriotism, this author attempts to excuse one of the great shames in American history. I have had the privilege of knowing some of the internees. To be kind, their experience and her description are not congruent. I think it is important to read and understand such propaganda, just as it is important to read Mein Kampf and the history of the Ku Klux Klan. Get it from the library, though. I hate to encourage such efforts. Some people believe them."
1,Sickening.,"The fact that anyone in america would believe this, much less write a book on it, is absolutely sickening. There is a clear difference between profiling and internment of US citizens."
1,Do not bother buying this one,"To anyone considering buying this book, I suggest you read it in the store. It is definitely not worth a dime. As for reviewers calling Malkin ""the best of the best"" know tha t unless you know nothing about history or ethnic studies, you will probably be impressed by this. The reader is drowned by her conviction and well, that's about all that keeps this historical fantasy a page-turner. Just read her blog for a dose of hate, it's free."
3,Enter: Mrs. Malkin,"Unfortunately, Mrs. Malkin has done a biased review of the Japanese Internment. She is after all, a Filipina. Being married to a white guy does not make her white.Her writing reflects her confused persona. There were Japanese spies, there is proof galore but that does not make the bulk of the loyal American-Japanese guilty of spying for the Japanese Military."
1,Don't spend money on this book,"A friend loan this book for me to read, as I refused to pay money for anything written by Ms. Malkin.I skimmed through some pages and got mad at myself for even doing that.Ms. Malkin will write anything to sell a book and make money.unless she lived through the era of Japanese internment and was born in an internment camp, or lived in Hawaii or CA at that time, or even served in WWII, then she should not write a book in defense of internment."
1,"Refuted by Ken Burns' ""The War""","Ken Burns' PBS production, ""The War"", absolutely refutes this garbage. Malkin is repugnant and ridiculous. I know Japanese Americans whose families experienced this violation of the Constitution (such as ""due process""). No, I did not buy this diatribe and nonsense; I read portions of it at the bookstore because good, reasonable and intelligent people should not patronize seriously flawed authors, such as Malkin, Ann Coulter, David Horowitz et al with their hatred and outrageous invectives. One should NOT ever pay attention to her opinion. She has lost all credibility."
1,Doing Her Job,"Malkin has a job to do in this book. She is arguing points clarifying historical inaccuracies regarding the Japanese Internment camps during World War II. Let it be noted that my review of this material is less about the authors historical perspective and more about her dangerous conclusions. Malkin makes a living selling television ads by saying inflammatory things. It is only logical that her book does the same. What you need to understand before you even approach this book is, you are peering down the most narrow tube of enlightenment and intellectualism possible...for the sake of controversy. Malkins extremism sells books. It does not however sell its ideas any better than a salesman whose product is visibly leaking mercury all over the floor.If you choose to read this book, please understand, it should be valued and judged based on its historical perspectives. Any more than that may prove to be a dangerous assassin to your common sense."
1,I can't believe they even publish this sludge.,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody with brain. It's just a load of crap. If you want to know more about Japanese Internment in WWII try ""Amache : The Story of Japanese Internment in Colorado during World War II"" by Robert Harvey. Don't waste you're time on this sludge"
1,Nausea-Inducing,"This book is the political equivalent of Ipecac Syrup. I don't understand its denial of facts, nor can i comprehend the thoughts of its author, herself a minority (Philippina) woman.I mean, this book was just *wretched*. Her basic premises are flawed and untruthful.Enough. I refuse to spend another second rehashing this vomitous book."
2,Book probably will not have effect on gov't policy...,"And for that we can be thankful. I'm all for the idea of profiling, but, like the Constitution and the President (who I loathe) says, it's illegal."
1,Why did Malkin,"Let's ignore the numerous historical inaccuracies Malkin included in this book originally (I don't know if they've been corrected in subsequent printings). In this book, Malkin passionately argues that there was nothing wrong with the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.And yet, in a May 2000 column in [...], Malkin makes this statement: ""The government has apologized and provided cash compensation to victims who were forced into camps. There is no denying that what happened to Japanese-American internees was abhorrent and wrong.""Like any good little pseudo-conservative, Malkin will change her tune if she smells money.The sad thing is, if a liberal commentator made this big of an about-face over ANYTHING, it would be the lead story on Bill O'Liars ""No Truth Zone."" Word to Michelle: stop attacking women who've lost their sons in war, and start cleaning up your own house."
1,Michelle Malkin Goes Buckaroo Bonzai,"Michelle Malkin doesn't deserve the attention granted in the press, nor the attention of publications which bother to review her anti-humanist sentiments. She is a fantastic idiot of outerspace proportions. What makes her so dangerous--unlike Ann Coulter--is that she--for ten pages at least--sounds reasonable and rational enough. But in passing the first dozen pages, her writing becomes inaccurate, hate-filled and dictatorial. Don't waste your time buying the book or talking about it anymore than you have to.I would rather you just watch this fanatastic clip of a ""Nation"" staff member who--instead of asking her to sign the book--asks her to sign a tragic photo of the Japanese Americans in their cages. Her facial reaction is better than most postmodern art.[...]"
2,History,"The book was purchased thinking that inside it would be arguments for internment and detention, and while some are made in the book, it is left wanting. The book is more of a history book than a philosophical one that argues weather it was right or wrong to hold Japanese Americans during WWII.If you are looking for the unknown history of the internment and detention of the Japanese Americans and the reasons FDR's administration did what they did then this book will knock your socks off. It is really very thorough.A better book by Michelle Malkin (who I love) is Culture of Corruption."
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,"There is no defensible reason why any American citizen of Japanese descent should have ever been sent to an internment camp, no matter how ""humane"" their treatment was. My mother, who was a child during WWII, had to watch as her AMERICAN classmates and friends lost their homes, their parents lost their jobs and everything they had worked for, were uprooted from their communities and were taken away at gunpoint. It's especially appalling since some of their brothers, fathers and sons were part of the American 442nd Infantry Regiment and fought with bravery and honor and dignity.Michelle Malkin can use whatever mealy-mouthed justifications she wants but the reality is that she is a racist."
1,Racism ... and self-loathing ... are never pretty,"Michelle Maglalang dives straight to the bottom in ""Defense"" and has pretty much remained there as she runs around trying to defend the indefensible and reserve her place in worthwhile political discourse. Sorry, MM, you have neither the chops nor the humanity. Avoid this sort of hate-filled trash and you'll live a longer and happier life."
1,Expensive Toilet Paper,"This book is not worth your time or money. It is Malkin's usual peanut gallery writing from the cheap seats of the ultra conservative right. She is an embarrassment to the conservative establishment as well as an ideological liability. Save some money and go to her website: www.michellemalkin.com, where she drivels endlessly about this issue, as well as other topics of interest.Do yourself a favor and buy William F.Buckley's latest memoir; ""Miles Gone By."" He is a truly eloquent essayist who makes substantive arguments against progressives. The quality of Buckley's work far supersedes all of the ""works"" Coulter, Michelle Malkin and Sean Hannity COMBINED.Otherwise, buy this book and keep it handy in the bathroom for those inoportune moments when one of your family members forgets to courteously refill the toilet tissue roll."
1,America,"I eagerly await Ms. Malkin's future publications; 'Justifying the Holocaust', 'Twenty-five Good Reasons for Bombing Cambodia' and 'The Myth of My Lai'.This is America. I respect Ms Malkin's right to express her point of view. There are more than a few authors who are envious of her ability to engender such high levels of emotional response. Such free publicity enhances sales and since her work will not withstand true scholastic scrutiny, she must make her money before public attention fades. This is, after all, America."
1,Interesting read and definitely for you....,"...if you want comfort in ignorance...if you believe in injustice and scare tactics to justify racism...if you cannot distinguish between a religious war and an WW2...if you displace the bitterness of the Pacific War onto the heads of JAs and not the Japanese.Amazon and other sites that sell this overpriced Charmin should sell this in their FICTION area if not in the lavatories.As a critic, I applaud, even if I do not agree with the POV, authors who can justify their position without twisting the truth. Although I do agree with a lot of Malkin's blogging on her own website, I find this book absolutely a disgrace as a mother, a female writer, and a Republican (just as Malkin is). Ugh...Even reading this book for free (a gift from someone who purchased it on your site), I find it abominable at best. Save your money..."
1,Despicable,Malkin will say or write anything to publish a book or get on the TeeVee and this book is proof of that. In her continual race to the bottom with Coulter she has actually tried to defend internment camps. Sick. Even worse is that there are people out there who agree with this. I can only assume they are racist.
1,This book is sick! ...and not in a good way.,"Anyone who can defend rounding up Americans without due process isn't an American. The woman is a facist, neo-con shill."
3,Not Taught in History Class,"Malkin writes with apparent authority and with supporting documentation for her statements. The facts finally come forward to the general public about the WWII U.S. Internment Camps of many more nationalities, other than the Japanese, mostly Europeans. Yet, we have only heard about the Japanese, who got paid $$ for their alleged troubles, thanks to Reagan. Are we now going to pay all the others?Threat Profiling is similiar to Criminal Profiling which has been successful for over 30 years. Threat Profiling is used by every other counrty in the world, yet Americans think it is something immoral. Immorality is the governments failure to exercise all due caution in the protection of its citizens. Threat Profiling is based on a formula of several factors, when those factors are present a reasonable suspicion should be present and additional investigation is necessary. That is the basis of Malkin's thesis."
5,The pursuit of Truth.,"Along with just about everyone else, my sympathy for the displaced Japanese-Americans needed someone to blame for the internment. However, it is better to discover the truth, which is, in and of itself, a desirable objective. Truth also improves our understanding of history.Ms. Malkin draws parallels to our current dilemna with mid-easterers so well that a high school history teacher could use her book as a primer in reseach and historical comparison.Malkin's best quality, other than her scholarly research, is her desire to uncover Truth (capitalized). Both qualities are sadly lacking in journalism, as well as revelatory non-fiction books that are badly researched, with pre-ordained conclusions. She is an intellecutal gem, and I hope she stays on the scene for a long time."
1,Malkin's Morally Bankrupt Project,Shoddy reserch is the corner stone of this morally bankrupt book. Potential readers of this work may first wish to read the details of Malkin's retraction and apology to political scientist Peter Irons and former internee Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga at http://www.isthatlegal.org/archive/2005/05/nine_months_lat.html
2,Required reading,"This was required reading for an English class that I had, and I hated every minute of it. It is definitely not something I would choose to read for fun. The story takes place in Guatemala and Downtown LA. If you enjoy reading about political corruption and the struggle of immigrants and poverty in LA, then you might like this. It may also help if you speak Spanish and know about Guatemalan culture, of which I know neither."
4,Good air filter,"Easy to install, Not as noisy as the other after market air filter/intake. Gain few more mpg and feel more power. recommended for normal daily driving."
5,Great book!,"If you are into the Release technique or a disciple of the Sedonamethod this book is for you. It is out of print, harder to acquire anda bit more expensive to buy from previous owners but a joy to have.It is 100 percent full of wisdom and words to deepen your spiritualjourney. It is totally worth it.I received the book in great timing, real fast shipping and incondition as advertised. Thank you."
3,Split Decision,"The front section of the book, with its glossy format, is a visual treat. The latter portion, with its faded photographs and mossy contrasts in typeset and paper color made me wonder if I had received a misprinted copy of the book. Not only will the planted containers need good light, I'll need it to read about how to put them together!"
4,A very good book for gardeners,"This is a really good book if you're going to make your own containers. The pictures and recipes are very helpful for making your own designs and for adapting to your zone. I checked this book out at the library so many times, i finally decided to purchase a copy for myself. I wish Mr. Smith would do a new edition with more recipes."
3,Bru-Ha-Ha-! You Are In My Power!,"At their worst, OL aliens talk too much and superiorly sneer. They usually do so with perfect pronunciation and urbane style, and love crowing about their plans. The alien in The Guests is one of these. It's still a good episode, though.The alien's origins are never disclosed, but what he's about is obvious on the face of it: he's constructed a human mousetrap in the outward guise of a house, with which to catch subjects for study. Most of his subjects are petty and venal. Until a drifter happens on in, and stirs things up a bit.The less said about this episode the better, for those wanting to see it. Suffice it to say it has great surrealistic sets, dark Gothic atmosphere, and good performances by the entire cast.Overall, this is a great deal more like a Twilight Zone episode than an OL. It has no opening or closing narration, and no real through story-line. But it is fascinating, and pretty creepy."
4,Rango,My children enjoyed seeing Rango very much and they would see it again and again if I let them.They loved his mishaps and that he was able to use his wits to win.
4,Rango,Im a big johnny depp fan and i always enjoy his work. i liked this movie a lot but would not recomend it to any child under the age of thirteen.
4,Really fun movie!!,"Great family movie that everyone will enjoy! I highly recommend Rango for an enjoyable evening, with or without popcorn. Worth watching again and again."
3,Watch the Language with Smaller Children,"This was a cute movie and it was action packed, but I watched with my 2-year-old and I was not happy with the language use. I heard ""dam*"" one time and ""hel*"" countless times. This is an issue in my house, and we had a conversation afterward about not saying those words."
3,Rango review,"Where do I start with this movie? The movie Rango was a good movie overall with a good theme and great graphics. After this movie I wanted to be in a shoot out. But besides that I think that the message of the movie was to complicated for children. It seems that it would fly by children's head. There were somethings that seemed unsuitable for a children's movie. For example, the language they had was a bit extreme for children. They used words in the movie like ""Son of a ...."", who was not able to finish phrase because he got carried away. The complex theme of this movie also had me considering why this was a children's movie. You have a lizard that is look for who he really is in life. A misunderstood character. Most children do not think about this growing up and seems that it was aid at an older audience then children. If I had to rate this movie I would give it a pg-13 rating. Not just because of the complex theme but because of the language and references to sexual things."
2,Not cool.......,"I won't repeat a bunch of stuff about the movie's darkness, or heaviness. And I will give it credit for the best animated villain maybe ever in Jake the Rattlesnake. Maybe I'm offbase, but the thing I didn't care for was the blatant ripping off of a Western movie legend, both in appearance, and even in mimicking his voice. Spirit of the West, maybe, but use the real guy if you are gonna do it. They even referred to him as ""The Man With No Name"", with nary a mention of the guy's REAL name. Can't get much more blatant than that. Timothy who? The whole thing cheapens him too - I'm surprised he took the part."
1,Aw-ful!,"Terrible movie, too much fighting and it just really sucked. I expected more with a name like Johnny Depp, but NOPE!"
1,TOO Stupid to be funny!!,"Some movies can be stupid to the point of being funny, but this movie goes beyond that point, and is so incredibly stupid that it is not the least bit funny. Just pointess and stupid, without any redeaming qualities at all!"
4,Adult movie,Great fun for adult movie fans. Children are lost by some of the content and most of the humor. Depp makes it work.
2,Slow,It was hard to watch it started slowly and went no where slowly. BUT the visuals were fantastic. The money was spent on animation not on script and story
3,Not THAT bad...,"First of all, this IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE! It is ful of cussing, and jokes about sex. Don't allow your children to view this film... but on the other hand, it is pretty entertaining for adults. It is really funny and i liked it. I guess it all depends on your taste though, so decide for yourself. Good Luck :)"
3,It really weird!!!,"I saw this in Blu-Ray and I really liked the details and clarity, although this really made it weird. Those animals look sick. Don't eat while watching this!"
2,Entertaining Beginning,"Great beginning. Predictable bad ending. okay for 11 year kids. Mild western/cartoon action and brief cursing. More than mediocre. Younger kids will enjoy the movie, and so will parents. The ending is too happy, predictable. Ending is a dissapointment. Parents and kids are sure to enjoy this okay comedy. Could have been a whole lot better especially in the end. Ending could have and should have been better."
1,Disappointing,"Rango was definitely not as good as I had expected. The plot had a lot of potential, but things moved much *much* too slowly. Aside from this, I was surprised by the amount of not-so-family-friendly content. This ranged from suggestive material to bad language. After watching Rango with some friends, we all agreed that we would not be interested in seeing it again, nor would we recommend it to anyone."
1,"Too painful to finish watching, even for free","I wanted to enjoy the movie but I couldn't get past the first 30 minutes. I usually try to see a movie to the end, but time is precious; couldn't do it."
1,Depp should not do voice overs,This movie was so lame. Depp's voice is not for the voice-over market. I love Depp as an actor but this move was so hard to watch and then Depp's voice made it even worse.
1,Simply unimpressive.,"'Rango' just never gains traction, in spite of a few clever bits. The humor is OK, but never hilarious. It tries hard, but the story never becomes emotionally engaging. Artistically it's a gray wall with the occasional piece of glitter stuck to it.I'd give it two stars, but the glowing first review is clearly astroturfing, so here's a bit of balance."
1,Feh.,"When I played the movie, it had skips and stops in it. I was able to view the movie and the price right so I suppose I got what I paid for.."
1,Was of 1.99 (even as a deal),"I wish I had read the reviews. Just a bad, boring script. Turned it off within 20 minutes. Tried later and still turned it off."
1,rango,"very bad copy;the subtitles were stuck on,the menu would not let me turn them off,the second half of movie was scratched up and it froze up.it kinda sucked."
1,HORRIBLE,"This was the worst ""kids"" movie I've ever seen. I don't know if its possible to even keep a child still while watching this movie because it was sooooo boring. This movie was not entertaining in the least bit. Don't waste your money or time by watching it."
2,Not for Young Children,"The movie is not something that young children should see.A lot of the content and comments are geared for adults. (Minor swearing in one part and adult innuendos throughout the movie)""New Age"" thought is in the movie, such as prayer to a spirit god.Singing during the movie was very distracting.Too bad....the story line could have been good without these things."
1,"Not what I expected, not for my kids","I was eager to watch this movie with my kids given the hype it received when it came up. Unfortunately, the movie was not what me or my kids expected and was a let-down all around. I thought it was not appropriate for my children at all... there were some inappropriate words (when you consider the young audience for which this movie is marketed) and the humor and storyline, (ex, the snack with a tail that's a gun) was not kosher for our family's expectation of a family film. Sadly disappointed. If you're looking for a family film, don't look here."
1,I did not like this movie,"I had high hopes, but it was weird. Too strange for me. The characters were creepy. I can not recommend this movie to anyone."
3,A good movie with a bad idea,"This is an ok movie. It was not good, but not bad either. The idea was stupid and had been reused over and over, but they made it so that is was still creative. The movie was a classic ""the hero inside you"" movie mixed with a western movie. If you have watched both types of movies, this movie will not excite you. It repeats all of the lines you already know, like ""It's not about what you are looking for, it's about your friends,"" and ""You're the hero of this town, now"". If you haven't watched those types of movies, you will enjoy Rango to some extent. There are many funny parts. LIke I said before, it's not a good movie, but it is not bad either."
2,Very dark and depressing,Grandsons watch (9 and 5) watched and liked OK. I found the movie dark and depressing and a fun movie to watch.
4,Not a bad kids movie,The viewing of the movie was nice and clear but it did have a few spots that froze. On my kindle fire that means you have to shut off the kindle then restart it.
4,Very funny..,"I'm not sure if kids will get all the subtle humor, but there's plenty of slapstick to make them happy too. Johnny Depp is awesome as usual and his voice-over of Rango is an absolute riot. Plenty of slick visual effects and a nice feel good story to keep everyone happy."
5,"Excellent, funny, sharply written production. Great animation.",Johnny Depp and the others do a fantastic job with this. And it's more adult humor than for kids because many of the lines they wouldn't understand.
4,On the fence...?,"Great visuals/CGI for those looking to push their HD TV's to the limit! Subject matter may NOT be for the younger audiences, probably for the preteens and up. Great ""cartoon"" for adults still young at heart..."
4,Great for the Kids,"I took my kids to see this film when it first came out. I was a little hesitant at first, especially after reading about the violence in the film. However, mine (8 and 13 years old) absolutely loved it. The story line is interesting and there were even small jokes hidden in there for us adults. The whole family loved it. I had to pick this one up on blu-ray right away when it came out."
2,Very surprised... not in a good way. :o(,"Let me start by saying I did not read any reviews before purchasing this... wish I had. I assumed it would be a ""kid friendly"" movie. I was shocked that there was cussing in this movie.... why is that necessary???"
4,I REALLY LIKE IT!!,"RANGO is a cool movie...the story is interesting and the visual of the film is great!I really like it...it's not a masterpiece, but i think everyone can enjoy this animation!!!!"
5,"Rango RULES!! Great, super funny movie!!","Anyone who doesn't get or like this movie has no true sense of humor. I admit, the beginning is a tad dry, but once the aquarium hits the road, its mesmerizing, funny and I mean laugh out loud, crying funny...Johny Depp is great as the lead and its a very fast paced, active movie that you do have to pay attention to, or watch a couple of times. This was a hit for a reason...I LOVE this movie!!"
2,It was ok,The language seemed like it was too difficult for my 6 year old but he understood the basic premise of the story. I only wanted to watch it because I am a big Johnny Deep fan. I don't think it will become a part of our regular rotation.
3,Cute but too violent for a 2 year old,it's mostly my fault that this movie is only getting 3 stars from me. I should have known better then to pick it for my 2 year old. The movie is cute and very cool visually but in my opinion too violent for a 2 year old. Animals attacking each other is pretty scary.
4,"Knew it was a simple story, but had to get it any way! I'm like that. . . I still feel it was a worthy purchase NO DOUBT!","I knew it was a simple story line, but I had to get it anyway, I'm like that. . . I still feel it was a very worthy purchase, NO DOUBT!"
1,We stopped watching about half-way through,Don't waste your money. Not appropriate for children and definitely did not keep my little one's interest at all. It will be in our garage sale in a few days!
1,"NOT a Kid's movie, and I didn't even like it as a grown-up movie","My wife and I have a habit of pre-screening our kid's movies before we let them watch (they're 8 and under). This movie failed our test, bigtime. **I wouldn't even recommend it for adults because it was just a dumb movie** (with admittedly an OK meaning)I might even rate it PG-13--not just because of the adult language, adult violence, and adult humor, but because I don't think my kids would even WANT to see it until at least age 13. And even then they'd only see it just to know for themselves boring and dumb the movie was. It's really not worth seeing which is too bad because a lizard holding a bug-eyed fish makes a cool cover and Dep is normally quite entertaining."
1,This was so bad we couldn't finish watching it...,"As indicated in the title, our family couldn't even watch the whole thing. BORING!!!! And a few comments were inappropriate for children as well. There are much better options available."
1,Horrible for children,This movie should have never been rater PG. It is full of ideas and innuendos that a 4 year old should not watch. Horrible!
1,Boring,This movie was a huge disappointment. I got bored 5 minutes into the movie. I do not recommend this movie at all.
1,NOT a kid's movie,We rented this from the local Redbox and boy what a mistake that was. My almost 6-year-old luckily lost interest in it before it got to the part that would have scared him to death. Not recommended for any home with young kids.
1,Rango Review,It is movies like this that give a bad name to animated movies. I would not recommend this movie to any one since the movie story is bad and will satisfy neither adults nor children. If you want to waste either your money or your time by all means buy this movie.
1,Not for children.,"My wife and I were very excited to see Rango, especially after seeing the previews. The only positive side of this movie is the absolutely gorgeous computer animation. The textures, colors, characters look incredible. However this movie put both of us and most of the audience asleep. The children in the theater were restless and MANY families left half-way through the movie. In our humble opinion, this movie was soooo boring. NOTHING like Ice Age, Shrek, etc.. The comedy just wasn't there, the desert / wild west theme got old quick, and the story really was quite boring. I will pass on this Blu-Ray disc. This is not a children's film and has none of the humor you would expect."
4,Very Funny - Some Adult Language / Concepts may be Rong 4 Kids,"I really liked this movie, as it works on many levels - particularly the 'O-Mage' to Don Knots and ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"".A Warning to Parents / Teachers - Some Language is Rong - for certain age groups, although much of that is in Spanish.The Toad exclaims in Anger: ""Madre Del Di..."" and later threatens to ""Strangle Your Huevos"" - Not Quite Grade School stuff, if any of the kids understand Spanish, or get another to translate.Haven't seen the Blue Ray - hear it is racier still.Regardless - I know of One 'Error' So Far - involving the Paper Umbrella that burns up in the opening scene - Unless there was something in-between i missed - which I don't think so....Anyone Else get the glitch?"
4,"Great movie, not for the 4 and under!",We took our 3 year old daughter to see this movie! I think the Hubby and I enjoyed it more then her! Great movie for 5 and up!
4,A very unique film.,"This is not you're regular animated movie. First off it is a western with birds, lizards,etc. as your characters and second it seems to be more geared towards adults than childern. The most surprising thing is it really works. Johnny Depp did a really good job at voicing Rango. He brings alot to the character just through his voice, it is really amazing."
5,kids absolutely love it...,"My kids (boy 10, girls 3 and 14) all love this movie and have each watched it over five times since we got it. The wife and I both loved it...great family movie."
5,Funny and entertaining...,"Me and my friend went and saw this on a whim, it was highly entertaining, with combinations of subtle and over the top humor. The animation was phenomenal. I noticed many people are complaining its not for children, I disagree, and I don't think whether or not its for kids determines whether its a fantastic movie. Anyways great movie. See it."
3,rango,"Rango was a good watch, funny! Animated fun for the whole family. Johnny Deep as the voice of Rango was great."
1,NOT FOR KIDS! FULL OF RACIST JOKES!,"RACIST JOKES ABOUT NATIVES, WAY TO SCARY FOR SMALL CHILDREN. MY KIDS HATED IT. WE TURNED OFF AFTER THE ""DUMB INDIAN"" JOKE REALLY DISGUSTED WITH THE NATIVE JOKES ECSPECIALLY SINCE ITS ABOUT A TOWN WITH NO WATER AND SO MANY NATIVE COMMUITIES IN AMERICA STILL HAVE NO RUNNING WATER. IN VERY BAD TASTE. THERE WERE A FEW FUNNY SCENES BUT, THIS SHOULD REALLY NOT BE MARKETED TO CHILDREN. PRETTY DISAPOINTING JONNY DEPP USUALLY PICS GOOD ROLES I DON'T KNOW IF THEY JUST DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MESSED UP THE JOKES WERE OR JUST DIDN'T CARE.PRETTY MESSED UP."
5,I really Like this movie!,"I've watched this movie several time, and I still enjoy seeing and hearing it. It is very well done and has a good storyline. I know what goes into making animated movies like this, so I can appreciate the artists attention to details and creativity. Fabulous work!"
3,too cute?,"Many old movie references, but I kept nodding off. Reloaded later to actually see the ending. Don't plan on seeing again."
2,Disappointing,I hadn't heard much about this movie but thought I would give it a shot. I went in with low expectations and was still disappointed. Not much to say about it other than watch something else.
3,Interesting,"Phenomenal graphics. Okay story. Funny voices with few chuckles. Of course, while not over the top, it had to include the obligatory social commentary . . . nature good - rich people naturally want to destroy it. Tiresome."
3,Entertaining,"This had some funny moments and lots of highbrow jokes for parents, but the pace dragged in some places of the film."
3,Wasn't as good as I thought it would be,reception was good but story seemed a little disjointed to me. characters were really gross so didn';t enjoy watching it. wouldn;t recommend it to others.
3,Rango Review,There were several places where the plot was draggy. There were several innuendos inappropriate for children. I wouldn't think the swearing would be necessary for a movie of this type. Only mildly entertaining.
3,Depends on your expectations,"Rango has some great strengths but isn't an all around ""family movie"" that everyone will necessarily enjoy. How much you like it will depend on your expectations. The visuals are fascinating: the feel of the desert is captured really well, the animations of sand, water, and glass are fantastic, and the animations of the faces of the various animal characters are very memorable -- more so than most live action movies. And unlike most mainstream animated films, Rango is willing to use a variety of lighting for effect, such as a very ""high key"" desert dream sequence.The plot and dialogue are unusual and the overall ""feel"" of the movie is a little dark, more in the direction of something like Coraline, definitely not a typical Disney or Pixar feel. I think many adults would find it funny or at least interesting, but small children would be either bored or scared. The trailer is definitely not representative of the movie, but that's not unusual."
2,Adult Animated Western - Definitely not for children,"The movie was okay kinda boring. I'm not sure why it was marketed to children as the theme, the dialogue and the language are highly inappropriate for kids."
1,Blah.,Not worth watching. I just wasted five minutes of my life on this before I could stand it no longer. Thankfully it was free or I'd want my money back. Don't bother with this one.
2,Rent it don't buy it.,This movies animation was great but the story it self sucked rocks. I have never wanted to fall asleep at the theater but this movie put me to bed and I wish I had not paid full price to see this one. It really is to bad it was not better.
3,Not for Kids,"Visually there was a lot to see. But with that said,the plot was rather tepid. Of even greater concern is that this is most emphatically way too scary for young children."
2,"Terrible, too much adult humor.","My cousins watched this movie in theater, and they all agreed that this movie was terrible. Some may find it funny, but there is way too much humor geared towards adults in this supposed children's movie. I would not recommend buying it, but if you r all that interested, go ahead and rent it from a movie store and save yourself some money."
2,Rango is Wrongo,"My family sat down together to watch this movie and my daughter walked out in the middle of it, saying she didn't like it. In my opinion, it's not a kids movie at all. Neither my husband nor I liked it. Just a strange and boring movie."
2,Do not watch with children.,"I am so disappointed with this movie. ""Creepy"" animation says one child. Spiritual element disturbing in it's mocking of worshipping Christ. The movie was finally turned off on a scene where a villan and heroine are swearing at one another. Seriously disappointing. Rent something that is...well...not this!"
3,Good plot...didn't expect the bad language,"Even my daughter (8 years old) commented on the language. It is totally unnecessary in a children's movie. We enjoyed the plot...several funny scenes....interesting perspective-going from ""pet"" to ""hero"" We were also able to use it as an opportunity to discuss issues in the movie for example, how disappointed the townspeople were when they found out they had been lied to. The negatives can be turned into positives with a little parent involvement."
2,Great animation.....just slowest movie ever,"This movie has beautiful animation, but the story line is the slowest I've ever experienced. This is not a movie for kids."
3,For those who know how to appreciate it...,"I expected more of Rango,.... but it's a good movie,... for those who know how to appreciate it.Good movie.Good animation.Good story.Good lines.Good music.Good western.Ok fun.I taught the storyline was good, but perhaps more for adults, then for kids. I think the western story is too complex for small kids. I even think there's so much in the story I'd probably need to watch it twice to get all the details.I liked the music. Especially the one during the great chase, with lots of action.Watched it with my 6 year old son,.. he liked it,... I was somewhat concerned for some scenes, the shooting,... but he didn't mind. And seemed to enjoy all the action. I think a year earlier he would not have been able to watch through it. Apparently he can watch through more action-oriented movies now."
3,Hard choice between 3 and 4 stars,"It was boring the first 10-20 minutes, then the story got more interesting. The animation/movie is not for kids, but for older audience because it includes death and a few inappropriate for kids moments. Myself, I considered the world/characters to be far from pretty, a little creepy. But that is just what I think. The plot itself was good but a little predictable. Had only one favorite character and that character didn't have many lines in the movie. Overall it's okay. The art and animation are well done, but overall I didn't feel like this movie was anything special to me. Still it's worth watching."
3,ok but not for kids,"I do not think this is a good idea for kids to watch as there is cursing in this movie as such I would not allow a child to watch as they hear enough through contacts,ect.. and I would not have ordered this if I had known. Thanks. Thelma"
3,Rango,Kind of disappointed with the overall movie. I think the best parts are all used up in the previews. At least the Amazon pricing makes up for the lack of overall entertainment.
1,Off the charts...,"Off the charts for boredom, uninteresting story, characters no one cares about, lack of drama, lack of comedy, lack of anything. The animation is perfect, so is the sound, and so are the voices, but those are the only positives. The film is morbid in the bad sense of the word. It's not for children, and as an adult I hated it as well. One of the few films and the only animated film I could not finish watching. My advice is to skip it and forget it."
1,"Pretty Visuals, Terrible Movie","It seems like a unique, creative idea lost its way in the production process resulting in a collection of disjointed events and discombobulated humor."
1,May I get the 30 minutes back......,I really wanted to like this movie. Interesting looking characters but about as entertaining as watching metal rust. So glad I only rented it from Netflix.
1,Disappointed,"Enjoyed Johnny Depp movies, until this one. Although the animation is top notch in quality, it is wasted on boring desert scenery and a dusty western town. Watched it with the entire family and all were disappointed that the plot moved too slow and the characters never developed enough to care about any of them. Save your money and rent it first..."
1,Whatching paint dry is less painless...,"WOW, what a terriable movie, I'm glad I rented it first and am now saving the money of buying it.I am a Johnny Depp fan, but was so disappointed with this movie...The animation was very good in this movie, but what good is that if you can't stand to watch the thing!Just when you think it is going to get better it don't and never does.It's kind of sad, because if it was written better it might have been a real hit...If you listen to nothing else of my review, rent it first!Then you will know exactly what you are buying..."
1,Bad movie,"My husband and I watched Rango for some lite comic relief. We were sadly disappointed! Hideous, nauseatingly ugly characters. Nonsensical story line. We can't imagine what age group this ""cartoon"" was designed to reach? Barf. It's going in the trash."
1,AVOID AVOID AVOID,"I loved the movie, but regret buying the disk. It has those HORRIBLE previews that you cannot even fast forward thru. So Boycott this disk and anything by Paramount and Nickelodeon."
1,Why Would There by a Lynching in a Kids Movie?,"Aside from the poor story line, lack of character developement, and language that you have no doubt already read in other reviews, I have no idea why you would throw a lynching of the random singing characters in the middle of the movie when it has absolutely nothing to do with the story itself. I have never been so frustrated and disgusted by the contents of a movie. I wouldn't take any children under the age of 10 to this movie, and the story line and humor is not enough to suffice for an adult movie.Final Thought: The movie did not have a target audience. It should hit the $5 bin at your local Superstore in the very near future, don't buy it for this price."
1,Cartoon for Adults,"This is NOT for children.One character said ""Go to Hell"" and another answered ""Where do you think I can from?""That's when my son and I walked out. 'Nuff said."
4,Good Movie.,"I love the movie, and I have most Johnny Depp films so I needed this to add to my collection, but the copy I got was used and still had the stickers from the library that it came from. The movie plays great, though, no scratches. This movie has quite a bit of adult humor in it, but nothing that I would mind my kids seeing. It's great that a western has been done for kids; I haven't seen something like this since the days of Looney Tunes."
4,Not bad,"Entertaining, worth the watch. Kids should like it but the snake guy can be scary so be there to put an arm around them."
4,Rango,"This was a very good animation. The plot of the movie is basic: Good guy becomes hero and saves the town and gets a girlfriend too! Looks great in HD on my 55"" LEDTV"
2,Definitely not for kids; just okay...,"Not only is the language above what most adults can comprehend these days, (which I enjoyed), kids will not be able to follow along. It also has inappropriate language which some parents will not want their children to hear. The plot was your usual chump becomes hero, anti-establishment, environmentalist, religious parody...unfortunately. It was interesting and it had its moments, but I wouldn't say I'd go buy it...or watch it for free again."
2,Ugh. Not funny.,"I have seen this movie a few times only because my children are little and they don't have the same standards for things as adults. Don't get me wrong....I absolutely LOVE kids movies and watch them all the time with the family, but this one isn't good at all. I don't get it. It's dark and not in the artistic and fun way. I just don't get it."
5,Absolutely love this film.,"Cannot for the life of me understand people anymore and I don't care. The one star reviews for this are beyond inane. To be a tad pithy this has some of the best animation and detail in ANY animation film made. The characters are whacky, likeable, and downright entertaining from start to finish. I thought from some of these negs I was going dislike elements in this one. Not a chance. Loved it to death. If you enjoy almost 3D like animation, without a 3D TV, and like the western setting and buckets of zany characters there is absolutely no reason not to give this a try. I liked it more than any of Pixar's recent offerings and pretty much everything else as well from the last couple years. I haven't seen something since maybe UP that has had me hooked but this one is a quite different way. You will notice the homages to certain films on the way through but nothing distracting. Pure fun and entertainment here."
3,Rango,The movie was cute in some scenes but I'm glad I didn't waste my money at the theater to see it.
3,Not bad for the kids,Not bad for the kids. Depp is good even as a cartoon character. Not a bad family movie. Thumbs up.
3,kids enjoyed it.,My kids really enjoyed this movie. They have asked to watch it a several more times with a lot of excitement.
3,Rango,"The quality of the DVD was great, packaged nicely, and came undamaged. The movie itself, however, left alot to be desired."
2,Can't Figure the Target Audience,"Wanted a fun movie to watch with a 5 year old and a 6 year old. It's not a children's movie...it's not an adult movie. After they wandered off to do something else, I watched the entire movie wondering who thought it was a good idea to invest in making it. I would not recommend it for anyone."
1,Not for children,DEFINITELY should be rated R! This is not a movie for children and should not be bought if that is your intention.
3,It's okay,"More hype, entries were the best. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
3,Kids?,This is an adult good guy vs greed storyline wrapped in a cartoon presentation. The 5 year old and up will get it for sure.
4,Great movie,This movie is one of my most favorite animated movies. The animations and details of the characters and settings is incredible! This style of animation is what sets this mObie apart from the rest. Great story and plot are another big plus from me. Character voices were perfect except Johnny Depp. He should've got a little more into a character instead of a regular voice.
2,"Ggreat animation, weak story","Great animation, weak story. There wasn't anything great about this movie other than Johnnie Depp and even he can't turn this into something that it's not."
2,"not impressed, easily a sleep through movie...","If I were at the movie theatre watching this on the big screen, even with the high ""volume"" I would have fallen asleep, that is how much I liked this movie. I did not like it. sorry to those of you who did."
5,Fantastic Movie,"I came into watching Rango not knowing what to expect, only to find one of Johnny Depp's best performances. Entertaining from beginning to end, Rango tells a great story that no one should miss."
2,Disappointed,This wasn't what I expected at all- the previews made it appear different. We ended up not even whatching the end of it.
2,did not like,I thought this movie would be a cute movie for children and adults but it was not! Not even appealing! So far no one I know has liked it! what a disapointment!
2,Not worth the money,"This movie is just not up to par with other antimated movies out there. Even with Depp's voice, if he would have stared in a real movie like this it would have been his bigest flop."
3,Rango is toooo slow,"I could not give this movie anything higher than 3 stars because its way way to slow moving and about 40 minutes to long. Its a real shame to because the actors did a great job and the animation is terrific. But the writers got wrapped up in themselves and dragged the story out with no action to keep the movie viewers attention. The sequence of getting Dango to the town should not have taken more then 2-3 minutes, but it seemed more like 20 minutes.Save your money and do not buy this movie until you have rented it first to see if you really want it in your collection. I only bought it because of Johnny Depp and Amazon had a great sale for only $10 bucks. That is basically twice the rental fee through Amazon so I took the chance and bought it. Sorry I did. It will be going to a discount movie/book store that buys back DVDs."
2,Bored to sleep,"The trailer made me want to see the movie, but once I started watching the movie with my husband we were quite bored. The best part of the movie what was shown in the trailer. So I will admit I did not finish watching the movie do to being bored. So I would not recommend this movie."
2,"Good animation, but that's it.",The animation of this movie is first rate. However the story is a bit flat. Animators please note; lizards do not have belly buttons.
1,Didn't make it five minutes into the movie.,"Really bad. I hate this movie. This is my least favorite movie ever! Worse then Home Alone 4! And that's saying a lot. DO NOT BUY IT! I didn't make it five minutes into this movie, and you probably won't either."
1,Wonderful graphics,This DVD was played at the mall as a demo of the Sharp Aquos TV.... The graphics were amazing and I bought the disk without reading reviews about it... It stars with some cute bits but for the most part is just BORING.... it is a nice way to see how well your big screen TV puts out a high quality image but you are likely to shut it off and look for something else to entertain you.. I have no idea how kids would enjoy it ?
1,boring,This movie is absolutely boring and the characters don't develop at all. Not worth watching or buying. Quality animation but that's about it.
1,WHATS THE HOOPLA,"Huh??? I am a huge fan of Johnny Dep and he was great as always, but I couldn't get past about 20 minutes of this movie. It was TERRIBLY boring. I will give this dud away to the thrift store. I am sure someone else will be thrilled to find it there."
2,Warning!!! NOT FOR KIDS!,"This was a pathetic excuse to make a western cartoon!!??? The story line was completely unbelievable. Oh well, you win some and you lose some."
1,"Terrible Movie, Terrible language, Not worth my time","I would assume since it was geared toward a younger set, it would be appropriate, not so. It starts off the movie with blatant sexual innuendo (the night is wet with anticipation, really?) and continues on in that theme of unnecessary bad language. Hell is said many times, when another more appropriate word could be used, as well as damn, couldn't we enjoy a movie that is PG without having to deal with this? Movies like this should be rated for what they really are, another terrible adult film, not an adult film that looks like a kid flick."
1,Rango movie a disappointment,I was not happy with this movie wish I had not spent the money..The plot drags along too slow and its like torture continuing to watch it. Which we did because we thought it has to get better right?? Wrong I'm disappointed in this movie. Amazon service was great it arrived quickly and in good packaging.
1,Less than one star.,Wow. What a bad movie. Poor script. No laughs. Depressing. Boring. If you stop and look at your watch twice...well thats bad. I had to give it one star in order to do this review.If you are looking for a good animated movie then I recommend Kung Fu Panda or Megamind but definitely not Rango.What a waste of time and money.It is not worth renting...not even for a dollar.I hope this review helps.
1,Not for kids,"When I bought the movie I thought it would be a great add to our kids movie collection. What I didn't realize is that it would have cussing in it. There are things I don't want my 3 and 4 year old saying like ""go to hell"" amoung other cuss words. Plus after watching the movie once I have to say it really wan't very good."
1,Not a kid's movie,"Sham on Nickelodeon for producing this. This is not a kid's movie. Too much violence and curse words including d**n and h*ll. Now if you're a teenager or adult, this movie is entertaining but this was sold as a kid's movie which it definitely isn't. I refuse to let my child watch it again."
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"My daughter went to this movie with MY BOSS. She wanted to treat her to a movie and Rango appeared to be a good kids movie. Most of the content was over her head. All she can tell me is that there was a really mean, scary snake in the movie. She has no idea what the story is about. In addition I was horrified to find them using four letter words. All of the adults in our party left the theater speechless.If you are an adult who enjoys strange humor and stories and enjoys westerns, go for it. I you are a parent looking for a good kids movie, this IS NOT it."
1,Too many four letter words for a 5 year old,"Language is over the top and the movie drags in some spots. Had a lot of potential but I think they just went a bit too far. This is one animated feature that my daughter will not get repeat views of.Edit:I love the fact also, that the Company men, ...er, avid reviewers are on here mocking the people for pointing out that this is not a suitable movie for children. Many Many movies are PG, but they do not need to include the brash language in this film. Parents would be wise to ignore the bot reviews to this movie. It's Long, unimaginative in it's story line, and has crude language for a feature that is marketed toward children. The graphics while good, are overshadowed by the rest of the nonsense in this movie."
4,RANGO,"IT IS THE TYPE OF THE TYPE OF MOVIE THAT KIND OF GROWS ON YOU,AFTER YOU YOU BEGAN WATCHING YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW IT IS GOING TO END, THE CHASE SCENE WAS TOO FUNNY, 'LOL'"
4,"Great movie, maybe not a kids movie though","This is a very interesting cartoon. My 3 year old loves it, but I don't know that I would necessarily recommend it as a kids movie. I found the movie very humorous and the story is a good one. I also really like the characters and Johnny Depp is especially wonderful."
2,"Nice animation, but lousy story","Lots of the animation scenes were pretty amazing, but I didn't love the story. Not so great for kids, either."
4,great,"our children really enjoyed watching this movie, i heard many burst of laughter coming from the living room as they were watching"
4,Rango Movie,It is very interesting and entertaining. I was a little surprised at the use of some bad language. I guess they feel the need to insert a few where they can get a PG rating which to me is a shame because it is a good movie even for small children.
2,Damaged Disc,"Decent movie. Upset that I received a damaged dvd causing the storyline to freeze and skip near the end of the film. I'm guessing 1-2 minutes is lost. Not worth the hassle of returning, but worth mentioning.Animation and colors are very good. Story is decent, but there are many parts I would consider inappropriate for younger kids."
3,It was cute for kids and adults,Very cute movie. Not one of my favs but it was pretty good. I like Johnny Depp and he shines through this cartoon character like he does in all the shows/movies he's in.
3,One of the few movies that I didn't like,"While the movie itself was well done (that's why it got 3 stars) The story behind the movie just didn't agree with me. I remember seeing the previews for this movie in theaters and being interested but, after watching the movie, I was very disappointed. The previews gave everything away and well the story fell flat after that."
5,"Mind blowing animation, and a completely unique art direction to boot!","I watched this movie in HD on Blu-ray, and it was stunning. The attention to detail was truly mind boggling, and I never ceased finding things to marvel at. What makes the artistry of this movie truly awesome is just how different it is. Whereas every animated movie that I can think of features cute, cuddly critters (which is also cool, by the way), the animators of this flick took a COMPLETELY different approach. They made every character ugly... REAL ugly. But therein lies a good deal of Rango's charm. Whether you're looking at crusty lizards, mangy possums, or dusty birds, these universally unattractive critters still manage to be extremely likable. You're not attached to how cute they are, but rather, the strength of their character. Hilarious dialogue and superb voice acting complete the package. Kids will love this movie, and so will adults!"
2,Not for Kids,This movie was not for kids. There was language not suitable for kids and the story line was less than worthy even for adults.
5,Unexpectedly Liked,"I was hesitant to watch, but my son talked me into it. Very good movie & fun for the whole family!! 5 stars for RANGO"
2,"Terrible, not for kids.","I would not let my child watch this movie. I don't understand why they put inappropriate things in movies marketed to children. I understand that people will disagree and that's okay. To each his own. My honest opinion is that I am not comfortable letting my child watch this, and I have no desire to watch it for myself. Children are not as naive as some people would like to believe. They DO pick up on innuendo. I don't want them to hear anything that I wouldn't want them to repeat. I'm glad some people enjoy it. It's just not for me."
5,English Woman Swept Up in the Desert!,"This is a low key drama written and directed by Galvin Lambert, screenwriter of The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone and I Never Promised You a Rose Garden. It was inspired by Paul Bolwes' The Sheltering Sky and is about a lonely English governess who ends up being a village man's wife in the Moroccan desert. How did this happen? She explains. It's not very pretty. The tale is one of a first world foreigner misunderstanding the culture of a 3rd world country he/she chooses to live in until it takes over their lives usually in a warped way. This film is exceptional in being the only film Gavin Lambert ever directed and in it's interesting take on the story. It was very nicely restored and is beautiful to look at. The Moroccan setting is interesting and exotic. Recommended for film buffs and connoisseurs of film classics. I found it very interesting."
3,too complicated,We really enjoy most of the Nancy Drew Games. The Scarlet Hand takes a vary long time and is complicated even using the walkthroughs.
4,Little but a lot of fun!,"A tiny bit of railroad land. The engine runs fine and the AAA battery lasts & lasts. It takes a patient parent to put it together as the screw is also tiny, very tiny. This ceramony is repeated with each battery replacement. A good thing to be involved with family play!"
3,Fun Childs mini-train set.,"This is a fairly cheap battery powered electric train. It is small and a child will NOT be able to put the battery in and assemble the thing by themselves. The gears are plastic and will easily strip if the train is mistreated. But with just a little care this train will provide hours of fun. I don't think I can recommend purchasing the train as a stand alone item, but only for use on the XTS tracks.We run several trains on the same track with each child controlling a junction. By routing the trains down the different tracks the children attempt to prevent them from wrecking.I was disappointed that the tank car did not have a hook in the back to make the train longer, but I am guessing that this was intentional because the gears could not take the stress of pulling more than one car."
2,"too thin, too general","this book was a disappointment to me. it was very un-specific, and did not really rate places in a way that makes it possible to decide where to go. this book might be useful to a first - time, short term visitor. I was hoping for a much more detailed work that would specify particular types of antiques (e.g. ceramics, furniture), and, even better, special periods or makers (e.g., moorcroft, doulton, arts& crafts). this book really didn't tell me any more than my eyewitness guide"
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I have read many parenting books, and I read this one because I was intriguted by the title...Passion is indeed one of the things that seems to be missing in the young people with whom I interact. I wasn't sure what to expect from Shmuley but I was pleaseantly surprised by the readablity and strength of the writing and content.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with the pressures of modern life on their family. It gives real-life advice for real-life families."
5,Wish i had this book earlier,I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK..IT IS SO EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND. ITS WORTH THE FULL PRICE. HIS TIPS WORKS AND HE SPEAKS FROM EXPERIENCE NOT FROM A PHD ....YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK AND THEN PASS IT ON TO YOUR FRIENDS.
3,Too Strict,"This is a basic parenting book with a religious slant. There is a fine line between setting healthy boundaries for children and being an overcontrolling parent. Boteach crosses that line. I have two young daughters, and although I dread the thought of them dating, I know it is a normal part of growing up. I want my children to learn how to make their own decisions as well as mistakes. My job as a parent is to protect my children while they are learning, not to control their thoughts and actions."
4,It Ain't Batman! But It Rocks!,"It was wonderful to see SRK tackle this science fiction genre. I thought the science stuff in the beginning too complicated for me, but I'm sure the science geeks will get it. LOL. Otherwise an enjoyable and entertaining movie. I hope Bollywood tries expanding in this genre. Imagine SRK playing the role of Batman Hindi style with a throw down dance number, Hindi style, at a Bruce Wayne party. The gorgeous Priyanka Chopra as Catwomen? Ummm. My international movie dream. :-)"
3,Doesn't Hold up anymore,"I remember it was a arcade game called E-Swat Cyber Police, and it was a cool afterschool arcade game to play. So when the genesis came out, it was only natural for them to release a title on the genesis, so we got this game. It's highly mediocre, a fake robocop if you will, the protagonist moves deathly slow, and this game is too damn hard to play. The average gamer couldn't even get passed the 2nd boss if they really tried, and the 3rd stage is the equivalence of a African Ritual to become a man. This game is just not worth it, you'll come out better getting something else."
4,Not as good as the 1st season,"Not as original and clever as the 1st season, but still great. Seasons 3 and 4 continued the slide. It's no wonder the show was cancelled."
4,"Futurama, Vol. 2",This is a wonderful boxset of DVD's. I would recommend you to buy this but you should buy the Simpsons boxset first (Seasons 1-5). But if you like Futurama get this also. Here are the episodes of volume 2.21-Nov-1999 I Second That Emotion28-Nov-1999 Brannigan Begin Again12-Dec-1999 A Head In The Polls19-Dec-1999 Xmas Story06-Feb-2000 Why Must I Be A Crustacean in Love13-Feb-2000 Put Your Head On My Shoulder20-Feb-2000 The Lesser Of Two Evils27-Feb-2000 Raging Bender19-Mar-2000 A Bicyclops Built For Two02-Apr-2000 How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back09-Apr-2000 A Clone Of My Own16-Apr-2000 The Deep South30-Apr-2000 Bender Gets Made (a.k.a.

3,i like the episodes,"this set is ok but i wish that fox would do something about the menu on this and the first set. there is no play all feature, that is my only complaint"
5,OH I FORGOT!....,"I forgot to mention in my review below, the voice of Bender (my favorite character) is done by John Dimaggio (Not the son of ""Joltin'"" Joe Dimaggio) He also does the voice of Elzar (The T.V. chef) and Mr. Panucci (Fry's former boss at the pizzaria)."
5,Volume Two: The Most Consistent,"While Volumes Three and Four of Futurama contain most of the all-time great episodes (along with some of the worst as well), I believe Volume Two to be the most consistently good. ""Anthology of Interest I,"" ""War is the H-Word,"" ""Put Your Head on My Shoulders,"" ""X-Mas Story"", and ""A Head in the Polls"" are among the best, with Dr. Zoidberg's ""Why Must I Be A Crustacean in Love?"" possibly being the funniest (if you like Zoidberg). Overall, it's pretty hard to find a poorly done piece, and almost every episode has enough good points to watch it over again. The only problem is, while all of this stuff is good, it's rarely ""great."" After all, it is the later episodes that become both funnier and more emotionally rendered, and here everything is simply well-done. This is NOT a bad point, however, because the quality of this Volume is amazing. Again, almost EVERY episode here is good. Buy it."
5,Futurama reaches full potential in this second season.,"As I said in my review of Volume 1, Futurama is one of the funniest comedies ever, live OR animated -- but it didn't quite hit its stride the first season. In Volume 2, however, we get to see the show in full-tilt mode: truly hilarious. Some episodes -- ""Popplers,"" for instance -- are just plain out-of-control funny. The only drawback is the clunky menu structure. At the end of each episode you get about a minute of black screen, and then you are back at the menu for that episode rather than the main menu for the disc. To play another episode you must select ""Home"" and then choose the episode you want and then select ""Play.""Buy it and laugh your shiny metal a*s off!"
5,Make that Pitch your Pitch you Pastard,"Obviously edited.Once again...this season rocksAnd once again:The simpsons freakin' suck, TAKE IT OFF TV, IT IS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE. Fox doesnt know a good show when they get one, its sad that hilarious shows like this and Family Guy were cancelled and horedous show like the Simpsons and god knows how mayny reality shows that they have stay on. GAH! Something is wrong here people."
5,best show ever,This and family guy are the best shows ever. They brought Family Guy back i really hope they take back Futurama it would be the best show ever.Sooooo if any 1 reads this and nows some one on the show or on fox please help my dream
5,Futuristic Fun For The WHOLE Family!,"Even better than Season 1! This DVD is just as high in quality as the first DVD, and the episodes are REALLY hilarious. WATCH as Zoidberg wants to mate with a beautiful female Decapodian named Edna. LAUGH as Bender dresses in drag to become his new wrestling persona--The Gender Bender. SING ALONG as the crew sings a parody of""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town."" PICK YOUR NOSE as Fry picks his nose while in handcuffs. Wanna laugh? This is one of the best ways."
3,"Where is the ""play all"" option?","Season 2 is far funnier than season 1, plus you have more episodes to enjoy. My only complaint is that most new releases (including season 3 of The Simpsons) has a ""play all"" option so you don't have to keep hitting back/back/next/next buttons to start playing the next episode. Please include this on Season 3!"
4,Futurama is Awesome!,"Love the dvd's. Was not happy when it came in the ""new"" style of packaging, not what the picture indicated."
5,Futurama Volume 2,"This DVD box set includes all of the episodes in season 2 of Futurama. All of the episodes are a classic representation of Futurama's great jokes and best characters. A great item for any true Futurama fan, you wont't be disappointed!"
4,Season Two Is Great! (Audio Commentaries Aside...),"I think Futurama Season 2 represents the show really hitting it's groove.And speaking of groove, ""How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back"" has got to be one of the funniest shows EVER!Who can't love the concluding song ""Born to be a Beauracrat""?By this season, the characters have really started to develop and the episodes were tight.If I have any complaint, it is that the creators, writers and performers of this show need to watch ""Family Guy"" and see how to act during the audio commentaries. These are extremely talented people, but I think perhaps they cram too many of them in the booth to do the commentary! They talk about everything, except the relevant episode information! There are specific jokes and scenes I would have loved to hear there take on, but they yammer on right through them as if the episodes weren't even playing!If not for the commentary issues, I would have given Futurama Season 2 five stars instead of four."
4,great workout for mind and body,"I was skeptical after reading reviews, but I am so glad I ordered this and Vol.2 - I loved this tape. I only started yoga a month ago and was looking to go to the next level - these tapes did it! Also, Bryan is the only instructor so far who makes me feel good about what I have accomplished and who stresses that there is no ""correct"" pose, that every body is different, and that yoga is an individual practice, not a comeptition. And besides that, I can already see a difference physically."
3,short and sweet,"the video was great for a SHORT,SWEET and POWERFULL intermediate workout, it is motivating and having the students on the video practising to bk instuctions is well worthwhile. on a critical point of view bk doesn't refer to postures by the sanskrit/indian names which i feel is important for intermedites to learn/knowoverall loved it - thank you"
5,One of the Best!!!,"Bryan is one of the reasons I love yoga so much! This is the intermediate- advanced tape, but you can modify to your ability, if you have basic knowledge of the poses.I take his class in Santa Monica, and although that is 2 hours or more, this is a good substitute when I can't make it. A great mind and body workout. And you see results soon."
4,Good workout,"Bryan is annoying- his voice and mannerisms, but the video is good. The workout is for an intermediate and not for a yoga novice. If I did not have previous yoga experience I would be doing many poses incorrectly because the video lacks decent instruction. The video is a bit too serious as well. Otherwise, I enjoy the stretches and the routine."
5,Phyical challenging,When I started with this video I had no idea of what I was getting into. Over one year later I am still at it having gotten phenominal results. I give him his due and credit. Also I see nothing wrong with him showing what yoga can do for an individual having his shirt off. Keep it Bryan and shoot for the star.
1,Not good instruction! Not recomended for beginners,"I purchaced all three of this series, I think the form of many of the students in poor and the form is not adequate.I was very dissapointed in these tapes. I teach at a local spa and I had my entire class watch these tapes. All of my students were able to see the problems on this tape.I expected more production from these, I don't recommend them for beginners, or anyone.I also felt that there was a tendancy for bk to handle the women more than men...."
2,The quality of this video is not that great....,"This tape is actually a cheesy version of a Yoga tape (in my humble opinion) and the quality is quite bad (video/sound etc.) But on a more positive note, if you can actually do many of the yoga poses, they are fairly tough and you'll be sore the next day!"
2,This workout does not measure up,"As an experienced practitioner of yoga, I assumed this video would be challenging, hence its title, Sweat. I did not sweat or feel energized, strong, calm, or light, as Kest explained would occur. Instead, I felt irritable and anxious, mostly due to his aggravating, aggressive tone. Furthermore, he rushes through the poses too quickly to experience their benefits, especially considering that the warm up is slow, and not motivating. The length of the video is also too short, as it does not allow the student to work every muscle. Anyone who desires a serious workout that results peace and stillness should check out Mark Blanchard's tapes instead."
5,VERY CAPTIVATING! ! !,"I truly enjoyed this book. He was a highwayman that stole her precious ring and her heart. Little did she realize that she stole his heart too. Dylan Marlow was disinherited by his Uncle, the Earl of Stoke because of a prank he pulled at Oxford. He started out wanting to marry Amelia Benedict for her money but then couldn't do it because he loved her and could not do that to her as he felt she deserved better than that. He had to win her heart. A very good read."
1,Awful,"This is one of the worst romances I have read. The hero (assuming we can call him that, since he didn't have many heroic qualities) was a whiner - he kept complaining about having made one mistake, while continuing to make many more. He was childish with a nasty side. The heroine was shallow (ok, unlike the rest of the ton, she worked for charitable causes) but she was still shallow - the women liked her first suitor because he stomped on the flowers in someone's garden. These were not likeable characters. I will not be reading this author again."
3,Once Wicked,"Amelia Benedict is suffering from ennui. The only real pleasure she has is to spend time with the orphans at Holcomb House. On the way home from the orphanage, her coach is stopped, and the highwayman steals her precious ring, but what disturbs her most is her reaction to his kiss. Dylan Marlow has come up with a daring way to restore his lost fortune. He has turned to highway robbery. The disinherited youth graces the ton with his presence, searching for a wealthy heiress to wed while robbing some of the wealthy lords and ladies. He finds his heart engaged when he encounters Amelia among the garden parties. But Amelia's thoughts are on the highwayman who robs her for a second time. How can Dylan compete with himself and gain the woman he loves? If you are into aristocratic Highwaymen, Once Wicked is for you. The premise is hackneyed, and the characters not endearing."
4,A good laugh!,"Gave me a laugh when I was wallowing in self pity during the first trimester! I recommend it to any expecting mums who are fed up with the ""joys"" of pregnancy!"
2,Medicore,The only reason I give this book a two stars is precisely because it is only occasionally that it manages to tell some important insight.There are quite a lot of book out regarding business there which you shall find much more useful.
1,A blatantly sexist look at gender roles.,"I have to agree with the reviewer from Key Largo. How long must we be subject to books that claim to be scientific and accurate only to be handed a bigot's view point? If the book equated women, Afro-americans or jews to animals it would be recognized as sexist, racist or anti-semantic. Males are the last group to be denied the common decency called respect."
1,"Crappy acting, ignorant fighting mistakes, horrible.",I'm frustrated that I wasted money on renting this movie. Multiple times they fought people but then didn't kill them just so they could come back and fight again - ignorant. This movie was just too cheesy for me.
4,Okay,"The movie had a lot of action, but you could figure out the plot most of the time. I would watch it again."
3,"Bad acting, ok action","All special agent Paul Ross (Randy Coulture) wants to do is to win back his ex-fiancé, but his plans are sadly thrawrted when his love is on a mammoth plane that's been hijacked (hence the genius name of this film) by terrorists, which makes his day that much worse as he had been suspended earlier that day.While not nearly as bad as some of the reviews that I've read, it's not a particularly good film either. The action scenes are all right, it's just that it's plot is devoid of any originality and is hopelessly derivative which draws comparisons to similar terrorists on a plane films that this movie can't help but not fair well to. The acting is also not one of its stronger.points. All said, the movie while watchable is a bit forgettable."
1,No Sound,"This was the first and probably last movie ordered. There was no sound! I really wanted to see this movie, and hear it!"
3,Randy Couture UFC Fighter,Randy Couture stars in this action film that doesn't deliver on the action. It wasn't bad just expected more from this film.
4,THIS IS A MUST PLAY RIGHT HERE ANDI RECOMEND SHADOWRUN TOO!!,this game is so awseome graffix arent so good but the gameplay is great seein this is a sega game i have to say WHOA the creaters need a pat on the back!
4,an excellent background book,"This collection of essays about the Pol Pot Regime is an invaluable resource for a student of that period. It is not a very good historical overview (read Chandler's book for that), but it provides several excellent sources for analyses of specific sides of the DK regime. Particularly interesting (for me, anyway) were the chapters on the intellectual origins of the Khmer Rouge, a topic that is often mentioned but rarely explored with the depth found here.Kenneth Quinn, one of the contributors, finished an appointment as US ambassador to Cambodia in July 1999."
4,So Far So Good,"We've only made five pots of coffee so far, but everything works as advertised and it's great to have a pot of coffee made from freshly roasted beans. The procedures are simple and the unit is easy to clean."
2,"Great Coffee, Klutzy Machine","This machine makes wonderful coffee. However, it is a MESS to clean, and is fragile. One of the lid hinge pegs broke quickly, and then the front latch broke. If the lid is not latched, it won't make coffee, beeping forlornly. I have resorted to duct taping it shut. My previous grind & brew was a Melitta, and it was just as fragile."
3,Great except for the mess,"This was great but cleaning it is an unpleasant experience. I would suggest a seporate grinder and thermal carafe coffee maker. The grind and brews get steam throughout and the grinds stick to everything. I love fresh ground coffee, but at times I would rather do instant, yes instant, than have the extra cleaning time."
2,Love Hate this Coffee Maker,"I love this coffee maker for all its features, which are GREAT. Unfortunately we are on our 3rd machine in 18 months. Our first machine was replaced at 6 months old when a short in the power cord was causing intermittent operation. Our second machine was replaced at 8 months old when the grinder motor locked up. If they could make this machine reliable, I would be its biggest supporter. Too bad"
2,reconditioned tells you something,I bought this coffeemaker for my mother for her birthday last year. Less than a year later she had to send it back to the manufacturer because the coffeemaker would leak out water and the grounds would end up in the water tank. what a mess. I don't think she ever used the grinder--pretty tough area to clean. The manufacturer was ACCOMODATIVE and sent her a whole new unit so i give them credit for that.
1,makes a mess,"I received this as a gift last summer. The coffee pot frequently overflows. Water flows out the bottom and the grinds on the inside overflow into the fresh water. I recently sent it back to Cuisinart and am waiting to hear a response. In the meantime, I am using a cheap generic coffee pot that works a million times better."
3,Cofffeemaker Cuisinart DGB300FR,It performed well but a small part broke inside the unit making theCoffeemaker inoperative. The part that broke was small but itcontrolled the flow of coffee coming out of the filter but it wasmade of plastic. We sent it to a relative and we and they aredisappointed.
4,"Great coffee, fairly easy to clean","Had this coffee maker in my family for ages. Finally found one for myself here on amazon. I love it, and it's really not hard to clean between uses, however grinds get into the well and take some doing to get out (hence the 4 stars).Make sure the bean holder and top are completely dry before grinding your beans, for best results. Also, permanent filters don't seem to work for this model, so you will need paper ones. I made a full coffeepot the first time and it came out weak. Now I make half to 3/4 pot at most. But I like strong coffee, so this could be a matter of taste.I had a Krups self-grinding coffeemaker for years but it kept breaking. This coffeemaker is much more sturdy. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Love the coffee!!!! Am thrilled with this product...,"Love this coffee maker!!! I have wanted a grind and brew for quite a while, but could not bring myself to pay full price. When I saw this, I ordered it. You do have to be very careful about loading the beans, or they will end up in the water resevoir. I love the coffee it makes; several friends bought one after seeing mine and drinking the coffee. Great buy!!! I have loved re-conditioned products every since I bought a re-conditioned computer 8 years ago for one of my kids. This list ""used"" on Ebay with a starting bid of 45.00:o) So, it's a pretty good deal!"
1,Not worth the money,"This item worked twice. The third time the sensor kept beeping indicating that the lid was open. It was clicked shut. The sensors were touching. There was no reason for it to do this. So of course it would not grind or brew coffee. Had to unplug it several times, reset the clock, reprogrammed it, no amount of work would get it to perform as the book said it should. Aside from that it was easy to use and clean but it is not attractive enough to just be a kitchen knick knack."
3,Poor design,"The carafe has a plastic ring around top makes it harder to clean, hinge on carafe is cheap, lid falls off easily. Brews good coffee but is difficult to clean a lot of nooks & cranies that are hard to get to.Buying with out seeing sometimes leads to bad choises, would not buy again"
2,Very much used!!!,"I ordered this cuisinart coffeemaker thinking it would be as good as new. When I opened the all-white box, I found a coffeemaker that still had dirt on it. I had to clean the whole thing before I could use it. I think smokers must have owned it. I can smell it. I didn't get the brush or scoop, either. I am seriously debating on whether to retun the thing!"
3,Cuisinart Auto Grind & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker,"This product is easy to operate and has good features. However, very difficult to clean."
2,Stressful experience,"Twice we were shipped a broken coffeemaker, both broken in places that made it impossible to make a pot of coffee. We finally gave up and my husband used pieces from our old coffeemaker to fix the new one and we are using it. We should have bought another. Amazon.com was wonderful about the return, in fact very courteous, easy to return, and we had a replacement quickly. They are a top notch site."
5,Fantastic!,"Hands down this is the best coffeemaker I have ever owned. I have only had it a few weeks but the coffee it brews is wonderful. It makes everything specific right down to the cup. Not to mention I love that the grinder is built in, I can skip steps and save the counter space. I read that it would be difficult to clean but with just some water pressure and a damp rag it cleans up fairly easy. It is the same difficulty if you were going to clean the grinder, but only I think it easier because all of the parts that do need to be cleaned come out so you never have to worry about getting electrical parts wet. I think if you are a coffee lover and looking for an excellent deal this is the maker for you. In fact you can not tell it is remanufactured, it looks brand new, only at the better price."
3,"Fine, while it lasted.","It did all it promised, made a very good cup of coffee -- I liked all the bells and whistles, but it broke down after about 8 months of regular use (about 1 pot per day) -- would have preferred it to last longer. but as I only paid $30 for it from Amazon at the time, I guess I got my moneys worth :-) -- it did start bogging down after about 4 months (taking longer and longer to brew, making more noise, etc.), and finally gave up the ghost (coughing and overflowing) a few days ago."
1,Cuisnat DBG-300FR,The bean and coffee holder would stick in the coffeemaker from the beginning and I had to use a knife to get it out. Finally I got tired of it and took my old one out that the top broke on - it at least works if you tape it down. I could send it back to Cuisinart under warranty for $10 plus $10 return - however for $39.00 it is hardly worth spending 50% more. I'll never buy reconditioned again.
2,Good Coffee - Poor Design,"As many previous reviewers have said ... this thing is a pain in the butt to clean, but beyond that it just is a poor design. There are all sorts for uneccessary and/or useless design points.In the water delivery system there is a small knob that you are supposed to set based on how many cups of coffee you are making. IT ISN'T CONNECTED TO ANYTHING!! And doesn't how much water you pour in control how much water is heated. What sort of nonsense is that?Buy a separate coffee grinder and use your old coffee maker. You'll save a lot of time otherwise wasted on cleaning this thing."
4,"Great coffee maker, slightly more of a pain to clean","I bought one of these coffee makers (refurbed) and just love it. Sure, it's not 5 seconds to clean out like some coffee makers are, but to be able to fill the hopper with beans and water and walk away and come back to a great cup of coffee it makes the 30 second cleaning process a mute point. I would highly recommend one, especially if you can pick one up for under $40.00."
3,Broken grinder,"Loved the machine. Used it 3x per weeek for 2 years. Great coffee. Great grinder. Problem is that the grinder just gave up last week and when you call the service number, they are only open on limited working hours during the week. Why not a saturday when I am using the machine? Hardly worth the expense of fed-exing the machine and waiting the 2 months to get it repaired. Should be more robust than this. Didn't get that much use. Otherwise, had no other problems with the machine. Thought it was great."
2,Too Many Moving Parts,"It's great to place the beans in the grinder, set the timer, and wake up to the sound of your beans being turned into the best brew in the world. Then the auto-drip-stopper thingy falls off, and after that the device develops some incontinence issues, where it can't hold its water, so to speak.Granted this is after daily use (sometimes several pots per day) for 18 months, but call me old-fashioned, I still expect more life out of a [costly] device (at that time).It was great while it lasted! It just didn't last long enough."
3,Satisfactory,"This coffeemaker works well, is a little difficult to dry areas where fresh ground coffee will stick, when wet, if you are making more then one pot.It is clearly stated that this comes with a gold filter but there was no filter at all with this item."
1,THESE BREAK DOWN! NO WONDER THEY'RE REFURBISHED!,"I have purchased and used 4 of these Cuisinart machines. Although I love the ability to have fresh ground coffee in the morning, they ARE difficult to clean--too many parts to take out, clean and put back every day.But the worst ""feature"" is that they break. Two have given up the ghost with the heating element burning out prematurely (and no, I didn't leave it on, it automatically turns itself off). One refused to grind at all after about 6 months.. Really shoddy quality!"
2,Good coffee but impossible to clean,"I had this for about a year before it broke. The parts don't actually wear out--they break off when you try to clean it. For these prices they are good to buy and then throw out when they break, but when you get one for the original price it's a hard pill to swallow.Not recommended unless you get a refurbished one for under thirty dollars."
5,Great!!,"As good as any cup of coffee I ever had. I can't imagine the average Joe (pun intended) asking for more in a coffeemaker. I've seen complaints about the cleanup. I guess these folks don't know about dishwashers, or cant stand 2 minutes over the sink. I think it's well worth it for the cup of coffe you get!!!"
4,Great coffee maker,"Great coffee maker, grinding the beans just prior to brewing certainly makes a different."
3,good coffee but poor design,"like most consumers of this product I have found the coffee tastes good. not excelent but better than pre-ground coffee. The coffee maker takes whole beans grinds them in the loudents possoble manor and then blows them all over the insides of the coffee maker. Then it brews coffee. to clean it you can put the pieces top rack of the diswasher with the heat dry off. but you need a mechanical enginere and the booklet to put the thing back together again. my advice, buy a differant coffee maker if you actually intend to make coffee with other people in you house."
2,Okay Coffee Maker,"This brews great coffee; unfortunately I have gone through 2 of these in 3 years. Not heavy use either. On my first one it started to leak the water from the bottom, and now my second one doesn't grind anymore. Still makes a good hot cup of coffee thou."
2,good coffee but too much hassle,"I ended up replacing this machine afer only about a yearbecause the little grinder mechanism failed. While it worked,it did make good coffee, but it was a real pain to cleanit out every day to re-load the beans. I always had toclean it out in the morning and let it dry all day beforeputting in more beans so they didn't jam the little screenbetween the grinder and the filter. It's also prettywasteful of coffee since some of the grounds stay in thelittle grinder portion. It was a real pain to reload ifwe ever wanted to make more than one pot of coffee.Whenever the power went out, we had to reprogram the timeand all the little features. Also, since it's so messy, Ioften had to clean it out extensively and accidentallygot some water on the LCD display which then startedacting very flaky.Overall, it just isn't worth the expense andhassle compared to a simple $20 coffee maker with a timer."
4,coffee pot,i am so glad i purchased this coffee maker. I wanted to buy it for a long time but new it was so expensive. when i found it was refurbished and had a warranty the price was wonderful. I read the reviews and they were great. I could not pass it up. It was packaged as new and easy to use. I think the coffee is wonderful. I do clean it after I use it as suggested by another reviewer. I can see where it could clog up if unclean. one of the best purchases I have ever made...thank you...
1,Good one if it works,"I liked the product and all the functions it should have had, but ours arrived broken. The grinder never worked. I did send it back, but ordered another one. I hope to have more luck second time around."
3,pricing,cuisinart automatic coffee makerdo not understand pricing. ordered reconditioned unit...charged price of new ubit..otherwise satisfied..may not order again.
1,Worst coffee maker ever,This thing takes an hour to brew a pot and makes the biggest mess ever. The coffee is weak and it is impossiable to clean.
2,dear god.,"My dad got this book for me. It didn't last me too long, I read the whole thing in about 20 minutes (mostly thinking about how wrong this book was.) It's just plain DISTURBING. Not in a good way. I mean it's just wrong. I have read things like Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, the Adventures of Lenore the Cute Little Dead Girl, and Gashlycrumb Tinies and some other stuff... well I have never read something as.... weird... as this. It was entertaining sometimes but otherwise I was just waiting for the extreme madness to stop. My favorite was the Debbies. That's about it."
1,a cheap imitation,"i found these stories crude, immature, unfunny, and cheap imitation of similar brilliantly written dark satires. This was not clever or interesting, but simply morbid with no point, or intelligence put into it.IF you are looking for an INTELLIGENT book of this same genre, please read a book by lemony snicket, edward gorey, or tim burton, but do not waste your money on this"
1,please don't buy this for children,"I mistakenly bought this book for my 7-year old, thinking it is a funny book. What a mistake! Its contents are definitely unsuited for children. It may also be revolting for many adults. Reading the rave comments by some other reviewers reminds me that ours is a very diverse society."
5,Twisted Sense of Humor?,"This book is perfect for anyone who notices the smaller oddities in life and finds them hilarious. DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE EASILY OFFENDED, but if you do, just lighten up, its (...) hilarious."
4,"Dark, strange and surprisingly funny","The stories may be short, but they're definitely not sweet. If anything, I think adjectives like ""twisted"" and ""warped"" might be more appropriate. But the book still manages to be funny and surprising, filled with many jokes only adults should understand. In other words, even disturbed children probably shouldn't put this on their summer reading list.If you know someone with a dark sense of humor, this book makes a great gift. Similarly, if you like a sarcastic story, mocking characters or cynical plot, you'll probably get a good laugh from this book."
4,"my kinda girl, that creepy susie","anyone who loves or even understand edward gorey, the addams family, ""geek love"", or any good old fashioned black humor horror tale will love this book. i did!"
4,"HOLY JEEBUS, this book is hilarious","I was out last night with a friend and out of boredom, we decided to go into Tower Records and books. Somehow, I stumbled accross this book. Its truly the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. We actually paid 16.95 for the book. I love the sick, side splitting humour and the crude and twisted animations. The book is eccentric and creative. I haven't laughed that hard in a while. My abs still hurt in fact. If you want to have sore abs and possibly pee on yourself from laughing so hard ...get this book =)"
5,Genius!,"Angus Oblong wrote this book, which was later discovered and then created into whats known as the Oblongs. If you are a fan of the show, or new to it all, check this book out."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I am a big fan of black humour, but Oblong lacks the style and sophistication of an Edward Gorey, the cuteness of Roman Dirge, or the social critique of Jhonen Vasquez. The story ""Debbies"", for example, does take an unoriginal stab at cliques (see the movie Heathers), but is very weak as satire. It does reminds me of the fun I had as a little kid telling gross and ridiculous stories around campfires (it is, after all, very juvenile), however at $25 for one panel of art per page it is not at all worthwhile. Perhaps if it came out as a thin, cheap comic book I would buy it, but only then."
2,ugh.,"Perhaps i was most annoyed because i was expectingsomethingwhich this book was not. i was expecting stories. this bookis instead a collection of full page, poorly drawn, incomplete illustrations with small snippets of text scribbled at the bottom. and the stories aren't so much creepy, as preadolescent."
2,You call this twisted?,"When I got this book in the mail, I glanced at it for 2 minutes and decided to send it back. From the description, I was expecting a picture book, or a collection of stories along the lines of Jhonen Vasquez or Roman Dirge books and comics. You know-with artwork and actual stories. Instead, these ""tales"" are just lame, short descriptions of a strange person or situation. A grade schooler could come up with more imaginative stuff than this, much less the simple black/white pencil drawings. Forget Tim Burton, Walt Disney would think this was lame."
1,Don't waste your money,"I saw the Oblongs cartoon series on Adult Swim and was mildy amused by it and thought this book would be kind of cool, like Tim Burton's 'The Melancholy Tale of Oyster Boy and Other Sad Stories'. Unlike 'Oyster Boy', This book is full of unintelligent trash that is a sad attempt to be witty. Right when there seems to be a shining moment he destroys it with lines like ""Susie's [...] tingled at the thought of Eric Twinklebutt"". There is no wit, no charm, and definitely nothing hilarious about this book. I wouldn't even suggest using it as a coaster because I would be embarrassed to let them know I wasted the money to buy this and the time to read it."
1,This book is soooooo unoriginal- you should be ashamed!,"This book was obviously quickly put together with not much effort, and I must add not many original ideas from Angus himself.... For others that enjoyed this book, why not look at much better executed PRIOR EXISTING versions by the likes of Tim Burton, Edward Gorey, Roman Dirge, Shel Silverstein and Gahan Wilson."
4,"A wonderful, revolting, sick and twisted little book","First of all, y'gotta love the author's name!This book is sort of like Edward Gorey meets Ren & Stimpy. You can read the whole thing in about half an hour and be in stitches for days. This, of course, assumes that you have a taste for the sick, the twisted, the gross, and the eerie. I especially recommend ""The Siamese Quadruplets"" in this regard.This is not a book for the faint of heart/stomach. It is not merely macabre like Addams or Gorey; in several instances it is downright revolting, but in such a silly way that I have to love it!"
5,Sick! Sick! Sick!.......But DAMN it's funny!,"I suppose you need a certain kind of sense of humor to really find this book funny...but if you have it and can look at these stories as just that, stories, even most disturbing ones can have you laughing out loud."
2,Funny................not $20 funny!,"I just received my copy of Creepie Susie about ten minutes ago, and I just FINISHED my copy of Creepie Susie about five minutes ago! It would have been nice if one of the reviewers had seen fit to mention that this is a $20 dollar book that is comprised of a little over 100 pages that rarely have more than two sentences per page. It's an odd experience reading a book whose page per minute/total expense ratio seems to be on par with your average 900# Psychic Hotline Rip off.I will say however, the crudely drawn characters (Think Terrence and Phillip from South Park) and the short (so very short) stories of cruelty and insanity, were so strangely unique that you can't help laughing. Just expected a few more of those laughs for the price"
3,Disturbing,I found this mildly humorous in a sick demented kind of way. My favorite was about the Siamese twins. Hardly worth the money for how short it was. It consists mostly of cartoon drawings with only a few words on each page.
4,At the very least worth a try,"While I wouldn't say Creepy Susie is the best book in its class it's defiantly a funny and entertaining read that wouldn't take up to much of your time.Gruesome and in their own way charming tales one must keep in mind these are stories made for adults and for people who don't mind a little bit of twisted and vulgar humor. The child like illustrations of the book often add very well to the dark themes of each tale, and the majority of the stories I found to be either fresh takes on older ideas ( such as Happy Sammy and the idea of conformity ) or themes that I either haven't seen done or you just don't see a lot of ( as in Narcoleptic Scottie ) .Some of my personal favorites being Happy Happy Happy Happy Sammy, Emily, Amputee ( short but very sweet ), Narcoleptic Scottie ( if you ask me the best story of the bunch ), and Jenny, Jenny, Jenny and Babette: the Siamese Quadruplets.All in all I would defiantly recommend picking up this book."
3,Nice compact system but far from perfect.,"I recently got a genesis 3 and while it is neat for the price and the size it is NOT at all capable of stereo sound. Oh sure the seperate genesis 2 stereo av cable fits alright but i found in my stereo system that the right channel *the red plug that is absent from the yellow and white included* does not come through at all. Stereo is impossible even IF you can find the red white and yellow genesis 2 stereo cable. I know because I tried it on my Genesis 2 and the stereo comes in. With the Genesis 3 it doesn't come in at all. If you want a neat genesis console to take on the road it's great, but DON'T buy it if you want stereo sound!...That is if you even CAN buy it. Deadbeat ebay sellers buy out Amazons entire stock as soon as they come in to sell on ebay brand new. There never in stock for long..."
3,It's Ok,"Sega is ok but it is nothing compared to dreamcast,psx,ps2,ps1,xbox and game cube.My sega just broke and there is nothing you can do about it so i had my sega about 7 years it and just broke if your getting it for a beginner video game player you might want to get sega or sega dreamcast."
1,haha,"I've have my Genesis for about 10 years now, and trust me: it's not all that fun. The graphics are 2D 16bit, NO cg scenes whatsoever. I'm gonna' sell mine. Sure, they game out with a cool looking Genesis 3 but that's the only thing better. The games are worth $.50 ea, with the exception of Sonic. That's mayhbe worth what, $2.00? Don't waste your time. Get an emulator instead for free."
1,haha,"I've have my Genesis for about 10 years now, and trust me: it's not all that fun. The graphics are 2D 16bit, NO cg scenes whatsoever. I'm gonna' sell mine. Sure, they game out with a cool looking Genesis 3 but that's the only thing better. The games are worth $.50 ea, with the exception of Sonic. Don't waste your time. Get an emulator instead for free."
5,GREAT SYSTEM & WORTH THE MONEY,"This is one of the best systems ever! The graphics may not look great compared to Sega's Dreamcast (but nothing really does look good next to a Sega system) And this is where the blue blur started out, right here on the sega genesis. While this is a smaller version of the original this still plays the same golden games. But the thing is, this is NOT made by Majesco, I don't even think it is distributed my majesco, so I don't know where people got that. But that is off the point, this power house was the 16-bit revolution, the start of 16-bit gaming, this is also where sony got a start of developing eventually stabbing sega in the back which led to the down fall of sega, who started 16-bit gaming, 32-bit gaming, and 128-bit gaming. So buy this and all other Sega systems before collectors like me take them all away."
2,Poor construction...,"The Sega Genesis was one of the best systems ever, so naturally, many people should be looking for one. To the untrained eye, this seems to be great. Super small, ...I bought one and loved it at first. It broke within one month of use. I didn't drop it, or do anything to it. I didn't even play it that much. So, the Genny 3 is not a very solid, sturdy machine. Also, you cannot attach the 32x or Sega CD to it. Nor can you play Virtua Racing. I advise you to look for a Genny 1 or 2."
3,Great little system.. Just be careful,"It works great and ad advertised. Same AV cables as the genesis 2/Nomad. But be careful with your controllers. If you pull hard, the system will freeze/crash/stop. I bought extensions for my controllers to prevent it, but still its a hassle. One small bump and it crashes!"
4,Interesante pero........,"Al principio es algo tedioso por la inmensa cantidad de detalles mostrados, los que a mi parecer no le suman importancia a la obra. sin embargo al entrar en la parte fundamental, sabrán que una vez leido vale la pena su lectura, sin embargo para alguien con principios religiosos muy profundos pueda que no le guste."
5,fun in the rain,"My daughter loved this (until she tore it up)paperback book. It shows fun in the rain, and yes, the monsters do use umbrellas in the rain. Doesn't everyone? I assume it is out of print or it couldn't possibly cost 18 dollars...."
1,A student's perspective,"This was used as the textbook for my introduction to nuclear engineering class. While the information as present and relevant, it is presented in a meandering way that doesn't tell you what's important. The problems presented at the end of each chapter expect you to remember numbers and formulas that may have only been mentioned in passing 7 chapters ago. Further, each step of the problems has been rounded, making the final answer very different from that gained by simply doing the entire equation all at once. This may have been understandable when the first edition was written, but we have progressed significantly beyond the slide-rule, and the new generation of nuclear engineers is operating with much more sophisticated technology. The available instructor's answer guide to the problems does not even give the location of equations and numbers, nor is there a comprehensive appendix with all forumlas and numbers."
3,"not a pro, so it's hard from me to tell","I think I feel some difference, but I cannot describe how much since I am a beginner. They cannot hurt though. I think they are WAY overpriced for being silicone type material. I thought about using that plastic dip stuff for plier handles and stuff.....***update***After months of use, I do feel a difference, but it is very subtle."
1,Not what I hoped for,"I listened to an interview with the author on public radio. I was very impressed with her knowledge about unjust convictions and the criminal justice system. It appeared to me that she had significant and valuable experience to relate to listeners and readers. I was hoping for a book related to that subject. Unfortunately from what I can understand so far this book is about what to me is the quackery of ""multiple personalities"". If you like well written quackery books this might be perfect for you. But if you are looking for any kind of practical or realistic knowledge than don't waste your time. This author sounded in the radio interview that she had a lot to offer. I hope she writes a book about the criminal justice system in addition to this kind of nonsense.Kenneth Ellmanemail:ke@kennethellman.com"
5,Love Israel Poems!,I really liked the poems about Israel. Anyone who lives in Jerusalem can relate to the sounds and smells described in Kim's poems. I would love to find a Hebrew translation of this poem to share with friends who love poetry about Israel but can't read English. There are one million Russian Jewish immigrants in the past 15 years and not many of them know English but learn Hebrew (required by law in Israel). I think they'll really like the poems.
1,Terrible poetry conveying offensive ideas,"This collection of poems is yet another of Kim's appalling literary works. It is surprising that Kim can call this material poetry under the Trade Description act. The poems lack any flow or direction.The most despicable aspect of this collection of poems is the offensive and vile political ideas that are being portrayed. The reader only has to read a few pages to realise what the author's views are in relation to Jews and Judaism. I found racial and religious stereotypes being presented in many of these poems.It is disappointing that the author feels the need to use poetry as a vehicle to present unsavoury political ideas in a more palatable form.I doubt very much if any reader, even those with extreme political views, will find these poems a good read. If the politics doesn't put you off, the atrocious poetry will."
1,Unbelievably poor poetry!,"When one looks beyond the peurile and rather distasteful content, one finds poetry of the poorest quality. The poems consisted of racist, sexist and anti-Semitic drivel. I was incredulous as to the level of experience the author has, when it comes to writing poetry. In some of the poems Kim attempted to use various metaphors with disasterous results. This book gives very poor value for money and is definitely worth avoiding."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I got a variety pack of these different wood chips, but when I smell them I can't tell any difference between the different varieties. When I cook with them, it just smells like burnt paper and it doesn't really do anything to enhance the flavor of the food. These chips are ground to the consistency of sawdust, so they burn very quickly. I bought some coarser wood chips from my local home-improvement store, and found that I actually COULD smell the difference, and I could taste it in my food too. From now on I will buy the larger chips and just put them in the blender if I need to break them up a bit."
3,A Time to.....end the series.,"The series as a whole has been entertaining. Some books were obviously better than others. Admittedly, this one was meant to wrap everything in a nice, neat package....and, it accomplished that. Unfortunately, to achieve that, the book never really went too indepth to any of the plots...perhaps, if this had been made into a 2 book storyline, that would have been achieved. Its ironic that my biggest complaints regarding several of the other storylines is that they should not have been drug across 2 books.All in all, an enjoyable read, but not terrific."
4,Good seesion by a fine organ band,"This is the recording of a good middle of the road organ band of the kind one could find in any major Northern or Mid Western city once upon a time. Now they are a rare bird indeed.Chris Foreman plays like Jimmy Smith circa 1958 which is not a bad thing by any means. Long time listeners to Blue Note Records will find much they recognize. Bobby Broom plays well, and Greg Rockingnham is a good drummer (he does the announcements).The tune selection is typical of what you could have heard at a performance way back when. The CD the trio put out is more interesting for tunes.Sonics are excellent and the visual production leaves nothing to be desired. It is one of the better jazz DVD's around of contemporary musicians.For comparison check out the Jazz Scene USA of Jimmy Smith circa 1962-the way it was."
4,Good pick,"First time using it and it feel very different. For m acoustic guitar work excellent on hitting all strings together but to play single string i need more practice. Good pick to try something new, you will feel very comfortable with how the finger adapt to it."
3,Different sound from pick,"The pick is a bit stiff for my taste; however, the sound is much ""warmer"" than a plastic pick. I would like to try a softer version if offered."
4,Just what I hoped for,"These picks will give you another tone option without changing strings. They'll take that bright edge off of your tone, which is just what I was looking for with my acoustic. I needed a more mellow tone occasionally. I think it works really well with jazz chords. Also, it makes it easier with vocals because it does mute the highs. Very nice.Now don't expect to do fast licks with them. As they say, they're rubber. They're going to stick slightly, so quick picking is not going to happen."
2,Not the greatest pick.,"I really don't know what I was expecting considering these are just rubber picks.They create a warm sound to every type of guitar I've put them against.Warm, and dull.Acoustic- Warm, dull soundStrat- Warm, soft soundArchtop- DullMaybe these would be better on a nylon acoustic?"
3,Unfinished Business,"I preordered this book before it was released. For me it is useful, informative and worth its price. It has helped me to build on and consolidate previous basic flash skills.However, it is disappointing that the accompanying web site FLanimation.com looks like it has been abandoned (as at Jan05) - especially since the book refers to it for checking out extra tutorials etc there. Unbelieveably they are listed as COMING SOON!!! After two months I am still waiting.Also I don't want to waste time checking over a tutorial to finally conclude that the action script example was not my fault, but that the text was poorly written. I hope that any corrections in exercises will be listed on the website very soon.This book is not near the excellence of ADOBE's 'Classroom in a Book' series. But then again, very very very few computer books are. The ADOBE textbooks are the benchmark. (No ADOBE doesn't write books for MACROMEDIA products.)Overall I am happy that I purchased this book."
2,Needs much better Action Scripting Examples,I found the sections on Action Scripting to be seriously lacking in easy to follow examples. The accompaning CD had completed exercises that are useless to beginners (not enough step by step examples). I have some familarity with coding as a Macromedia Director User and could not get some the exercises to work (example:Excercise 1 Chapter 7). I got very little from this book and would not recommend it to anyone. Needs better step by step examples.
4,Good reference for animation and effects in Flash MX 2004,"In her book, Animation and Effects with Macromedia Flash MX 2004, Jen DeHaan covered the animation effects techniques in Flash MX 2004.Jen started her book with a fast introduction to Flash MX 2004, and then she moved on to the animation techniques in Flash, motion tweening, shape tweening and frame by frame animation.Also, she did not miss to mention the animation using action script. And in the end of the book, she included useful appendixes about publishing SWF, time line effects and keyboard shortcuts.However, this book is a good reference for intermediate designers and developers that want to get a solid background on the animation in Flash MX 2004."
2,This book is a mess!,"If you already have a basic understanding of Flash and just want some exercises to work though to refresh your skills and get some unexpected practise in spotting and correcting errors, this is not a bad book.It's inconsistent, incomplete, and error filled. If ever a book needed an online errata, this one does, but there isn't one. This book needed an editor, BAD!It's ten chapters filled with errors and a tiny bit of decent Flash stuff peppered in to keep it from being totally worthless.The menu line on the book's web site is cute though. (...)I'd suggest looking elsewhere for Flash instruction, maybe one of the Macromedia books, someone probably proofed theirs and there's probably errata as needed."
2,Decent but cheap as hell.,"No matter how good you are at this game, nothing can prepare you for the lame cheap fest your in for. I beat this game countless times but it never stops pissing me off that the enemies are so cheap, the game is so unfair and how they use the screen layout to their advantage. Half the time no matter what you do you can't move because your getting gang raped and your sword magically goes through enemies running past you preparing for the gang rape, then your screwed. I love games that are challenging, but not insanely hard just because of crippled controls and cheapness. Fun for a little while, but the cheapness is too much."
4,Pretty good,"This has to be one of the most recognizable games of all time. The Genesis port is pretty faithful to the arcade, though of course the graphics aren't as good and the music is a bit tinny. Still, this is possibly one of my favorite games of all time. Choose from warrior, warrior maiden, or axe-wielding dwarf. The dwarf kicks ASS, though he could use some kind of armor or something. What's with the green pajamas? No wonder he's so pissed."
1,"Great book, shame about Kindle version","Very useful reference book particularly for the primary exam. In the kindle version however it is difficult to find entries. I was excited that I might be able to type a heading and be brought directly to the entry, unfortunately you can only choose the first letter from the chapters and then browse to find the heading; this is made harder by the fact the headings merge into the previous body of text unlike the book where it is easy to make out the start of a new entry."
4,Anesthesiology A-Z,"I bought a book as a preparation for European Diploma in Anesthesiology exam. It is very good book, it includes also topics in physics, chemistry, genetics, biology...which are a part of above mentioned exam. The only drawback of this book is that it is written as an enciclopedy or dictionary and as that it is difficult to read.Regards!"
3,fun..for about 20 min,I liked this game a lot but the only drawback was tha i have windows xp and w/ windows xp the graphics really [were bad]. It totally took away from the gameplay. If you're looking for a really good shooter go try Ghost Recon. but otherwise quake 2 is pretty good for the money. Be warned xp users their is a fluke in this games graphics for xp. It worked better on my friends 98 than on my xp so something is up. If anyone knows how to fix this graphics problem please write it into a review
4,"The first was better, harder, and smarter","Quake II's plot doesn't make any sense cause why would ONE soldier go against an ENTIRE army of baddies, instead of his men fighting alongside him? I wished that your soldiers were also there, on the planet, with YOU killing baddies. And I also laughed my *ss off when I saw the ending. Games like Half-Life or the original Quake are FAR superior to this type of gameplay. But I've gotta admit... the weapons in this game are just plain BAD! And what I mean by bad, I mean GOOD. The original Quake I think was the first game to be skeletal-animated. And the AI in this game is stuupid! I just stood in front of a guy and shot, and the guy never fired back! What IS this? And Quake II's air enemies are just SO small I can't even see them! Quake II doesn't have Apaches like in Half-Life or any Gargantuas as well. Quake II doesn't have anything BIG... except for the guns. :)"
4,Baby's Favorite,"My 10 month old picks this book every time we read! After a month of significant use, the pages are showing some wear, but Mom is the only one who seems to mind. I will be looking for others by Anne Geddes to purchase."
5,Great Baking Set!,"I love this set. Simply, it's heavy duty, cleans easily and is actually non-stick. I have used the baking sheet the most. It bakes oven fries, chicken tenders, anything that's frozen just wonderfully. Nothing sticks, it cleans very easily. I high recommend this bakeware."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was so tired of my old ugly baking pans so I bought a set of Anolon, a large pan, a smaller pan and a baking sheet. Both the large pan and the smaller pan have peeled and rusted. The baking sheet I rarely use. I bought these at Costco and thought I was finally getting something of a little better quality. They lasted five months. Not a very good deal. I was just going to cook something for my dogs, and I looked at it and realized I would not feel safe cooking even for them in this pan.No more Anolon for me."
5,Great,Bought these for my wife and she likes them. I like the rubber handles and they are heavy duty... Will last quite some time...
1,Bakeware rusts,"I have had probably every single bakeware product of anolon. It has been almost a year and I'm currently in the process of sending them in to be inspected by anolon. I have not used the bakeware that often and they RUST fairly quickly. The rust starts where under the pans where the metal is folded (I guess I would call it the lip). I didn't notice this at first........but when I would take a pan out of the dishwasher, rusty looking water would drip out. Then I realized where it was coming from and sure enough.....rust."
4,"Great game, instant classic","This Final Fight wannabe is of the lowest quality -- graphically and otherwise -- out of the three Streets of Rage games that were made for the Genesis, but it still has stout gameplay. You play a white guy, a black guy, or a woman--depending upon which character you can identify with. The object is the same as it is for any such game: beat the crap out of the same three or four enemies that come at you without end, pick up steel pipes to bash opponents, and eat food out of garbage cans to regain your strength. Finally, meet a tough boss at the end of each stage. Rinse and repeat. Overall, an enjoyable yet somewhat repetitive game."
3,Dialogue Missing From Original Vinyl Issue,"This is an excellent CD, but not true to the original vinyl dual LP release.In an engineering gaffe, the transfer of the original tracks to CD has an omission. The LP includes a dialog introduction to ""Let's Get Together"" that has been omitted from the CD due to a reference to God. It does act as a prologue to the song and its absence is disappointing. Instead of this relevant piece the producers chose to leave the extended applause noise, especially after ""Windy"". If you are a die hard fan of The Association you would enjoy hearing what this CD is missing. All LP's that are transferred to CD should be done so in their entirety, not pieced together to omit that which the producers deem to be irrelevant, controversial, or ""out-of-date""."
1,Lamb in love,"I find it very difficult to read novels set in England by American authors who do not follow English expressions. As an example: the English say and write ""looking out of the window"" not ""looking out the window"". I did not enjoy the book vey much."
5,Tales from the Perilous Realm,"Fabulous as usual. I hope Christopher knows that his painstaking work, is so gratefully appreciated by all of us that love Middle Earth, Valinor etc.... Thank you for giving us, books that will be read and re-read for years. Christopher's writing prowess should not be overlooked. He used notes, many nearly illegable, to produce these masterpieces. I think he is a great author in his own right. His Father would be very proud of him. I hope everyone who loves these books, writes a review, and remembers to thank both JRR & Christopher."
3,Alright,"This is an audiobook of some less well known Tolkien stories. The quality is good, but do to the pacing of the stories it can get a bit slow. Probably only appropriate for big Tolkien fans."
3,Dramatizations of minor Tolkien works,"Fans of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are unlikely to find these works quite as satisfying as those two books. Except for the fourth narrative, the Adventures of Tom Bombadil, they aren't even set in Middle-earth. They are fairy-tale-like stories, half read and half dramatized by the BBC, and the productions can be a little hokey, almost like children's stories. If you don't mind that, and don't require the same level of seriousness as is found in The Lord of the Rings, they've very pleasant. Most are allegories of the imagination and creativity.The last disk is excerpts from the BBC's dramatization of LOTR, focusing on Tom Bombadil."
4,Excellent fun; a multi-voiced BBC production (not an unabridged reading),"This almost 3 hour production by the BBC Radio is a great deal of fun. I must admit, however, it took me a short length of time to get used to multiple actors recreating the stories, rather than simply listening to one actor reading the stories unabridged.After I realized how the stories had been produced, I had a marvelous time listening to the works. I've been a Tolkien fan since I was 12 years old - usually focusing on the Middle Earth related works - and I had never read (or heard) these stories. Listening to these stories (fables, really) provided me with new and interesting insights into one of my all time favorite authors. The actors voices are well-cast, and their parts are well-played. Recommended."
3,"Modern fairy tales, Tolkein-style","A few decent stories rather in the style of fairy tales, but nothing terribly exciting...and I still don't like Tom Bombadil."
4,More From the Master,"I am an avid Tolkien fan - so I jumped at the chance to hear this audio presentation. In essence, it contains much of 'The Tolkien Reader' - and an embellished recount of the meeting of the 4 hobbits with Tom Bombadil in the Old Forest. These are all older BBC recordings that have just been re-released.Although my copy didn't include at cast reckoning - I distinctly heard the voice of Michael Hordern as a narrator - and if I am not mistaken Farmer Giles sounded like Brian Blessed to me.This is a 3-CD set. I don't think it will appeal to a broader audience, but any Tolkien fan will get a few hours of enjoyment."
3,"Tolkien, but not Lord of the Rings","Not sure if I'm supposed to review the performance of these dramatizations or the actual tales themselves. For the latter, this is Tolkien, but definitely not Lord of the Rings. These are earlier stories, and smack of Tweed England - they are funny, and homey, and sort of proper in that old fish n chips sort of way. For the former, the dramatizations are standard BBC, which isn't bad at all.These are really fun for passing a car ride, especially if you have kids along."
4,Bre's,This is a charming ensemble from master story-teller J.R.R Tolkien. Each individual story has its own freshness and appeal that endures multiple re-readings.
2,So-so stories on audio - no replacement for reading,"I generally prefer reading to listening to books on audio and this set did nothing to change my preferences. I had previously read Farmer Giles of Ham and was hoping to enjoy hearing it on a rainy afternoon. Unfortunately, having actors' voices replace my imagination didn't work. Though I am sure it was a well-produced set of CDs, in my opinion, it just didn't work."
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"This book is mind-bogglingly boring ! It has a leathal combination of really childish stories, with those oh-so-long poems of master Tolkien, which I could never get myself to even remotely like.I love a good Tolkien book like everybody else (Lord of the rings, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion are my personal favorites), but when he starts to go on and on about that Farmer and his wretched dog, I really regret about spending my money on a book I was warned about (!) for being too childish. I can just smack myself on the head for purchasing it.My advice to you : Better save those bucks, and the next time your softcover edition of Lord Of The Rings starts to show signs of tearing, buy a new hardcover one."
4,"Great intro for Tolkien for the novice, nice re-visit for the fan","Great production values, nice quaint stories and some quintessential Tolkien poetry. I loved having stories read to me as a kid which is most likely the primary reason I enjoy audiobooks as much as I do, and this audiobook is no exception. If you are unfamiliar with Tolkien, then these stories will serve as a basis or introduction for continuing your odyssey with Middle Earth. If you're already a long-time Tolkien fan, you've probably already read these at some point, but you will most likely still appreciate having them read to you, just like beloved bedtime stories. I will definitely be listening to these again."
5,Horrible proofreading,A fine book spoiled only by the worst proofreading I have ever encountered in a similar book.
5,A must read for those with HIV & for their support system.,"Dr.Romeyn has addressed one of the most serious problems facing people with HIV, the devastating bodily wasting that occurs in those struggling with the effects of this disease. Her work is a comprehensive approach to nutritional treatment. She is articulate and yet not patronizing. Her concern and compassion for those who suffer from this dissease is quite apparent. I believe those who see her in her private practice are most fortunate. I am grateful for her work, and have given copies of this book to several men and women both in the parish and in the community at large.There is a great need in the larger community for this quality of information. I highly recommend it."
3,"Good book, but...","This is an informative book. However, it did not meet my expectations.It even gets boring sometimes. However, it is a good book to have if you are interested in learning more about vitamins and minerals, and their effect with HIV/AIDS."
4,Bottomless Bass Space,"Bouyant basscadet in search of magic noise, SKD threads Trance Ambience for Horizontal and Vertical Bass with breathless finesse. An outdoor exersize in fretboard synergism, he rejects the bass's displacement as a subordinate servomechanism of digi-culture to lift off from a barefooted biosphere with new atmospheric pressure. Weaving sheer fabric for soundness of the body-mind, supple twinelines dance in meditatively alluring low-tones for a deep breakfast with a view that could dramatically change the surface temperature anybody's groove room.~ DJ KenshoAuricle : electrozine of aural culture"
4,Better Than French Fries and Just as Addictive,Yes this album is pricey but it is well worth it. This collection of French pop songs from the 60's is unbelievably catchy. Even though I don't speak French I find myself singing along. If you are looking for something different and fun give this a try.
3,Only American called Chips as French Fries,"Richard Siegmeister doesn't even know that Katerine isn't from 60's although Francis Lai , France Gall , B.B., etc are.Woohoo and I also strongly believe that the Compiler of this album isn't french either. I must admit that i'm not french either eee!!what do i think about this album "" Mary Roos - L'Autoroute "" WORTH you buy this album.it's GORGEOUS , BEAUTIFUL, TIMELESS song and wht more.... this song on 7"" format is selling at $30 something on a japanese site. so no matter this album contain such a terrible track such as ""Claudine Longet - Un Homme et Une Femme"" it still worth for you to buy and just skip it !!!nahh overview of this album is OK i just can't stand that Claudine Longet's one , there're other million great version of Un Homme et Une Femme to put it besides Claudine Longet's one . that's what i believe that the compiler is not french and weren't in the french scene at all.."
3,Good; liked it BUT,The product was good but i did not get the Adapter Stem which is necessary to be used with food processor
1,"run away, this is garbage","This is the biggest piece of junk I've seen in my life..It makes me angry to think that I wasted good money on this.I thought Cuisenart was a good brand, but like everyone elsethey just slap their name on a piece of Chineese manufactured junk. Don't even think about buying this piece of junk. I wish I could use a stronger word than ""junk"".. junk is too kind."
1,don't waste you $$ on it,"don't waste your $ on it. spend a few more and buy something better. the blender isn't the best, actually it's pretty horrible even at just making smoothies with frozen fruit :/ not worth it!"
4,"Blender: 4 stars, food processor: 3 stars","This is a very handy appliance, but if you're considering buying it, make sure it matches your needs. Since the capacity of the food processor is quite small, get a bigger one if you use it a lot.I was primarily interested in the blender for smoothies, etc. and the food processor is a nice bonus that allows me to prep veggies or make sauces quickly.Pros:-well-constructed-excellent power, great at crushing ice and frozen fruit-easy cleanup since the buttons are integrated into the machine, and there are no cracks for things to get intoCons:the spout on the blender is definitely not driplessNo problems with the reconditioned appliance, and for the price and functionality, quite a good buy."
2,Ain't an Oster...,"After 20 or 30 years my Oster died. So I thought I'd 'upgrade'.Cuisinart does not impress. The top for the food processor arrive shattered and was replaced promptly--no fault there. Since then the base has lost bits but still gets by. The plastic used is obviously on the brittle side.Things that would blend quickly in the old Oster hang and make you shake and bang the blender to get it going again. The blades are recessed in a depression and that obviously isn't as smart as the open design.Frankly, it is more form over function for this product. The motor is a little underpowered; the fancy button are fancy without adding functionality; quality takes hind seat to pizazz.On the other hand as a limited needs item in a small kitchen the duet function is appealing. If your needs are limited and you don't make frozen drinks or coldslaw every weekend, you have something that will serve and probably fairly well."
2,Pipe not 100% for 2002 Grand Prix,"I should have read the other review first. I had the same problem and more. I purchased the resonator, ""Y"" pipe and both quiet flow ss mufflers. The left side muffler ended up being very close to the muffler hanger mounted on the body. Pushed muffler back into the pipe until it bottomed out. Then the stock exhaust tip now hangs lower than the right. Drove car and left muffler still rattled on body muffler hanger. Had to bend body muffler hanger down to prevent the hanger from hitting the seam on the top of the end cap of the muffler. I really expected more from a Walker system. Unfortunately stuck with it now."
2,Pipe to Long,"Take care, pipe is about 1/2"" to long for my grand prix and causes mufler to hit on the rear hangers"
2,Frustrating Game makes a Frustrated Reviewer,"First of all, this game isn't too original as other reviewers may have commented. Whenever I play it, it reminds me of monster party, but more cheesy. The controls on this game are more slippery than a mucus covered hagfish while ice skating on your toenails. The attacks that this ""Max D. Cap"" guy does are ridiculous. He attacks by punching out his stomach, or whatever the hell that is he shoots out. This game also is very difficult. You get 3 continues, but this game requires for you to need more lives than that regardless of gaming skills. Overall this game is rubbish, Saying that it's good, is like saying playing Modern Warfare on a Pong console is cool. Im a major fan of classic 8 and 16 bit games, and the graphics on here weren't too bad, but not appealing. It's not fun either because while you're playing it you could think of a million platform games that surpass Decap Attack."
3,cheap cheap cheap.,"this is a very unorigional and cheap game. the graphics look like that of the master system.the controls are very wierd, because yor character has to slow to a stop rather than just stopping when you let go of the joypad. what's with the character names in this game? Max D. cap? Frank N. Stein? Chuck D. Head? it's the dumbest excuse for character names I've ever heard..."
2,"Don't be fooled - this is a live concert recording, not a ""best of"" collection","Don't be fooled by the ""Very Best of"" title on the cover. This is a live concert recording from London in 2004. As live concerts go, it's not a bad recording, and Brian Setzer is in good form with both his singing and guitar playing.... but I was disappointed, because I thought I was buying a ""best of"" collection of the Stray Cats' past studio recordings."
5,Fantastic videos,"Pop Screen displays REM's videos at their most experimental. It is a true statement of Michael Stipe's artisitc vision.The videos run the spectrum for silly pop (Stand) to a very sinister and hauntingly gorgeous meditation on war (Orange Crush). In between we have a nudity (Pop Song 89), homelessness (Talk about the Passion), a boy and a dog (Its the End of the World as we Know It) and even Michael's sister (The One I Love).A must."
1,Purchase a different R.E.M. product,Yuk! The cover of this DVD is misleading -- the cover does not disclose that this product is merely a collection of amateurish (artistic?) video clips running in tandem with R.E.M. music. Be warned -- this is not a collection of the band's professional videos; and the band should have ethically disclosed this fact on the cover. This taught me not to buy music DVDs in some store; instead I'll check reviews on this website beforehand and purchase through Amazon.
4,A Rarity Worth Getting,"I had never heard of this album. Who did? It was never released.I don't know if it's kosher to release an album that an artist refused to approve for release (even if you're releasing it long after the artist's passing), but I am happy DG has opted to do so (I'm sure they can point to some contractual permission for doing so). London's singing on this CD isn't simple by the usual vocal standard, but it is simple in that it is honest, musical and enjoyable.Yes, some of the arrangements are over-the-top, but does it matter? Surely, the singing is what's important, and great singing it is. Personally, I kinda liked the couple of arrangements on this CD that have a New Orleans flavor to them.I recommend this CD, but shop around. You'll find it more-attractively priced elsewhere."
3,An interesting mix of live and studio work,"This is definitely a rarity work with live cuts of Todd and Utopia performing songs written by other artists (i.e., The Who, The Move, and the Beatles!) But there also are some excellent solo versions of Todd ballads and one unreleased studio track that is pretty good! This disc also includes promos for S/A? and a few other miscellaneous things. Until the Rhino Delux Something /Anything comes out (if ever!) this is the closest you'll get to some of his radio program songs performed by him. The Japanese sure know how to re-master. This is 20 bit and sounds great!!"
4,MUST READ,"I REALLY ENJOYIED THIS BOOK,KEPT MY ATTETION THE WHOLE TIME. THIS BOOK IS A GIRL GROWING UP TO UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES OF HER HERTIAGE BLACK AND WHITE."
4,Breath of fresh air,"""These books, IDA MEA, and IDA MAE The saga continues,were like a breath of fresh air."" The characters were alive tome, which must be a direct reflection, of the talents of the author. I found myself at the beginning of the books wondering what I could possibly take away from these stories. I thought that there would be nothing that I would be able to relate to, because of the time setting of the story...I could have not been more wrong! Though I was not able to relate to the era,... the pain, joy, suffering, and experiences that Ida Mae and her family shared, are universal...They cross all bounds...age, sex, religion, race...there is something for everyone in these stories!....After having the pleasure of meeting and talking with the author, I felt even more touched by these characters. I will never forget Ida Mae, and never forget Delores Thorton....Thanks Delores for giving us Ida Mae...she is someone that we can all be proud of...(I can't wait for your next novel ""Babe"")"
4,Many Twists,"Ida Mae and Ida Mae the Saga Continues is the life story of Ida Mae, a black woman who was raised by white parents back in a time when that was unheard and un-thought of.... This story has a unique blend of views from future to present to past of Ida Mae's life. It is a very interesting read with many twists and turns that will keep you going. Enjoy!"
5,This Book Will Make You Believe You Can Conquer Anything!,"This book allows you to get personal with Ida Mae. You will not be able to believe the triumphs she conquered and tragedies that this lady overcame. The author keeps you in awe and desperate to finish so as to get your hands on her continuing book, ""Ida Mae, The Saga Continues"", to learn the outcome of Ida Mae's life. This was one strong woman!"
4,She likes it.,"Nice piece, I have seen comparable pieces a bit less expensive, but I had to have it shipped and this was a good option."
5,Thorough but concise,This well-indexed volume covers a lot of ground as concisely as possible. Great reference or course text.
3,religious,Purchased for a class I was takeing. Personally i found it a little dull reading but it has a lot of information.
4,As Funny As Telecom Books Get...,"Those of you who are not involved in the telecom industry may not have an appreciation for this book. However, as someone that has been involved in the telecom industry since 1992, I have to admit that I was fascinated with it.Barry Harrin's writing style is casual and humorous. The book essentially is his profesional autobiography, and covers his rise from the bottom rung of the telecommunications ladder at ""Ma Bell"" to becoming one of the top technical executives in his field.The book is very short, at around 120 pages. The chapters are only 2-3 pages apiece, and you will likely read the entire book in a single sitting. It certainly is a difficult one to put down.For those of you in the telecom industry looking for a good laugh, this book is a genuine treat. It's one of my personal favorites."
4,Entertaining post bop,"Dawkins' pianoless quintet plays in a style that seems to combine Art Ensemble of Chicago with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers. Dawkins and especially trumpeter Maurice Brown are the key players. This is earthy,uninhibited jazz that should appeal to all but the most conservative listeners. Audio and video are excellent, and the Original Velvet Lounge venue in Chicago is priceless. Performance dates back to 2005, but Dawkins and Brown are still going strong in 2012."
3,"nice, but too small","I liked the quality of the glass, but yet again a regular sized bottle of wine will fill the decanter too full. I guess the magnum size is my next try"
5,great entry-level product,"This compact, elegant decanter is perfect for my $10-$20 wines. Doesn't look like it holds much, but plenty enough room for 750 ml. If you don't have much space or drink expensive wines, this one's hard to beat, especially for the price."
1,Incomplete character sketches,It must have been published and reviewed by relatives or close friends. Lazy writing. Boring book.
3,Good Starter or Refresher but MANY errors,"I finished this textbook-like book recently although at several points I almost put it down due to the continual errors that I attribute to both the author and the editor. As others have mentioned, there are simply too many silly errors-- such as the refloating of the first 'Lexington' in late 1943, the reappearance of the 'Shoho' long after it was sunk, or the Hellcat divebomber (F6F Hellcats could divebomb but the plane was designated a 'fighter'). Some of these errors were so egregious that I laughed out loud. Every several pages there was a goof regarding a name, place, or equipment.But, despite this frustrating problem, the book is a worthwhile read on the basics of the war in the Pacific during World War II.Coming in at over 700 pages the author does a good job of covering the major events and also throws in a good number of interesting details and quotes."
3,"A good one volume treatment, with some factual errors.","Costello has written a very good one volume trreatment of the Pacific Campaign. Easily one of the most readable volumes written on this part of the war. I was disappointed near the end when I discovered glaring factual errors concerning the Battle for Okinawa. It may have been simple conclusion drawing or poor editing, but it misinforms the reader as to the reasons the Japanese chose the strategy that they did. Dispite this and undoubtably other minor errors I would highly recommend the volume."
4,Good but annoying goofs,"This is a very good summary of the Pacific War. In particular the coverage of teh Southeast Asia theater and how the Allie's plans for Europe were intwined their plans for the Pacific theater are well presented. It really needs a thorough proofreading, however. It is amazing how often he says ""west"" when he means ""east,"" for instance. He will also confuse people or ships in the same chapter. Two that come to mind are Kakuta/Kurita commanding the Aleutian forces during Midway, and Lexington/Hornet participating in the Doolittle strike, but htis sort of thing happens a lot. Add to this silly goofs like saying Devastators carried bombs, and you have a book that makes you roll your eyes frequently. If you are unfamiliar with the Pacific war, however, these discrepancies could really confuse you."
5,Excellent Book,"This is a very detailed book providing information on the Pacific War I have not seen in any other book. Of particular interest to me was how General MacArthur lost most of his planes (and thereby the Philippine Islands) on the first day of the war because he refused to obay standing orders to attack Formosa in the event of hostilities.The writing style can be a little dry in places, but the detailed information and insights keeps you turning the pages."
2,"Good, but only about 50 pages worth of actual content","The stories in this book are interesting to read, especially if you spent years riding the Metra trains as I did back in the 1980's. However there just isn't alot in this book. It seems like the authors did everything they could to stretch a small amount of content to fill an already small book. Each new story starts halfway down on an odd numbered page which leaves about 30 of the even numbered pages totally blank. All the text is also double spaced with even more unnecessary space between paragraphs. Would have been nice to fill some of this empty space with a photo or two, but there are none. If this was formatted as a 'normal' book, you'd probably have around 50 pages to read at best...which isn't much for a book that costs almost $25."
4,The friendly field guide....,I found this an amazingly easy guide to use. I dont know why original product manuals aren't this straightforward.If you are a keen but not fanatical photographer this is for you....
4,Nikon D70 Field Guide by David Busch,I liked the text to sit back and get a better idea what I had bought at my own speed. I started out with a Nikon 35mm for my work. The change to Digital Photography D70 was a trip made easier by this book.
3,A better general photo book than specific to D70,"This book is quite pretty. I find it, however, to be better at giving compelling examples of photography basics (e.g. night time photos, macro photos, etc.) than specifics about the D70. Its a good book, but the magic lantern one is more helpful if you actually want guidance that is specific to the camera, instead of just an annontated list of the functions the camera has. For example, its fine that it has an auto ISO function, but how does it work and is it a good idea to use it? This book takes no position on such issues."
4,Just what I needed,This book is a helpful addition to my resources regarding the use of my Nikon. Thanks
1,Poorly indexed,"It's a sad reflection when the manual that comes free with the camera is easier to navigate. I want to use the self-timer and/or the remote. The index in this book directs you to the custom setting menu, and shows you how to change the time delay, but it doesn't tell you how to actually set it up. Now granted, the info' is in the book, in the quick tour at the front, but you pick up the Nikon manual, and you can go straight to it. No fuss, no muss."
5,The book that Nikon should have sent with the camera,"This book is way more informative than the manual. Not only does it cover all the capabilities of the camera, it covers the when to use them, and the why to use them. It also covers various types of photography, & the settings you use. I am a hobbyist photographer so I found this book extremely informative. I take along in my backpack, & have used it for reference frequently in the month since I purchased it."
2,Lacking in Details about the D70,"This book simply fails to provide the necessay details about using the D70. There are many times when you simply need to read the D70 Users Guide to figure out how to use the camera. For example, on page 23 it discusses how to use the shooting mode button and it tells the name of each mode. If you look on page 29, it shows the icons for the various shooting modes. But there is nowhere it the book where it states which icon goes with which mode. If you want to know, read the Nikon d70 Users Guide. There are countless similar places where the book fails to provide enough information. Most of the book is a beginners guide for how to take pictures. If you are looking for a comprehensive guide for the D70, look elsewhere."
4,Nikon D70 Field Guide for Beginners,I am very pleased with this book which is clearly set out and covers all aspects of the camera's many functions. One small criticism is that there are a couple of small errors in the text and this is a little disconcerting as there may be other errors.
2,if you know anything about your D70 and photography,"find another book. this book has 36 pages dedicated to the D70, and the rest of the book discusses general issues that apply to photography in general. we know our owner's manual well and had hoped to gain additional insight, but we found nothing in this book that is not in the manual. overall, a waste of our money, but might be worth your's if you've never read your manual and know nothing about photography."
2,Lacks focus,"After leaving my D70 in the closet for a couple of years, I recently decided (largely out of boredom as an unemployed) to play with it again, so I needed a refresher and bought this book. Unfortunately, like an average-joe photo, this book suffers from a lack of focus. The first five chapters discuss the D70's functions and accessories, but lack depth and breadth in coverage (e.g., where are the Speedlites?) and are little better than the D70's translated-from-Japanese manual. Chapter 6 tries to teach you how to take ""great"" photos, while the sample photos are far from being great by any measure. Again, depth is sorely lacking. Chapter 7 discussses editing pictures but is short.In the end, I found I remembered most of the advanced functions of my D70 by simply playing with it. Now I need a job so I can upgrade to a D90..."
1,This is not what is claims to be.,"This book contains brief summaries of several topics related to building pools. It does not contain enough information on anything to enable you to build your own pool, or hire subcontractors to do it. It does not address how to hire subcontractors, what type of subs to hire, things to watch out for, etc, nor does it go into any degree of detail on how to build a pool. It is a basic intro to pools -- a waste of time if you need to get information to help you actuually do something. I would return it except postage will cost me about half the price of the book."
2,Pretty useless,"The content of this book could have been condensed into 20 pages. The information was much too general, even for me (I'm a new pool owner and not technical or mechanical at all)."
3,Helpful if you are going to build,Helpful to read if you are going to build new. Good to read even if you are having contractors perform most of the work. Other books may be more appropriate for current pool owners.
3,good to see,"Although this wasnt the best effort of this author, it was good to see the progression of the character."
2,Too little for too much.,There just is not enough material for the cost of the book. This needs more photographs of the actual gear.
2,"Good songs, but there's a better place to find them.","Radiohead recently released a new compilation of sorts with some of the Hail to the Thief era b-sides. It's called 2plus2is5 and it has all the songs off of both Go to Sleep 1 & 2 and There There. So really there's not much reason to buy all three of those for 15 each and spend 45 when you can just spend 15 once and get some remixes and live tracks.Songs - 4/5 (you can tell why they were cut from the album. While nice, they have little flow to something else)Album purchase 1/5 (But like I said there's good reason not to buy this, you can now get it for an affordable price.)"
1,buyer beware,"If you order this don't expect the import - what you will get is the domestic version of ""Go to Sleep"" that usually sells for $5."
3,Radiohead. Always good. Get Knives out with Fog and Kinetic.,"Great.. Could be better, but Radiohead is always good. Try the Knives out single with Fog and Kinetic. It is my favorite of their singles."
3,Go to Sleep,"""Go to Slpeep"" is obviously a pretty cool song and it makes a great single (can't wait to see a video). ""Gagging Order"" is a great tune, it has a sweet acoustic guitar with Thom crooning beautifly over it. This single would be great if it weren't for the last song, ""I Am a Wicked Child"", which is trash and a complete waist of your time and thier effort."

5,A beautiful watch!,It's very nice. The look is very modern and it's perfect for a casual look but also for a non-very-informal look.
1,0 stars is actually how i would rate,the author writes about how most camping in hawaii is beautiful pleasant and only at certain beaches has an unpleasant atmospherewhen in reality the truth about camping in Hawaii most campsites are loaded with homeless people who are bringing tons of junk to the campsites to live there after all it is easy to live for free in a place where it never gets coldon Oahu camping is prohibited on wed and thurs to discourage this but its still a scary proposition to camp there.Hawaii really needs to charge people on a per night use fee before camping in paradise will ever work.overall this book is a SCAM on the unsuspecting camping tourist.get a hotel package instead
4,Gosh... ......,"...Hawaii, like everywhere else has a problem with litter and with homeless people. It also has some of the most amazing and beautiful places you will ever find. Meg may be trying to discourage tourism with this review. Many do. Read this book and visit Hawaii; but please do your part to keep it beautiful and leave it cleaner."
5,Tama! Tama kavud!,"If you recognize my Amazonian, then you are a true Strider. I still have this annoying line spewed out by the Amazonian women going through my head like 20 years later. Had to write this review. Also, the pirrhanas were sick. I liked to commit suicide just to see them eat me alive. Come on, you know you did it too!"
5,Wow what an album!!!,"I first saw Danan Healy perform in a small club in North Carolina and have been a fan ever since! She is an amazing performer whose voice captivates from the very first note. Port of Embarkation is an wonderful album! Danan's gutsy emotional voice shines through each one of songwriter James Durham's beautifully crafted songs! Higlights for me are Blue Sky, Virtual Woman, and Hotel Room. This duo obviously has something to say and I eagerly look forward to future projects!"
5,Absolutely THE BEST guide to Chicago. And here's why...,"I travel a lot, for both business and pleasure. I also think that I know Chicgo very well. I, of all people, don't need a guidebook for this city. I happened to come upon Avant Guide, and I was first attracted by the graphics. This is not a 'normal' guidebook. It's very stylish. Then I was taken by the terrific recommendations of places I had never heard of. Whenever I show this book to my friends in Chicago, they want to thumb through it forever. It's hard to get it back. The book is incredibly well organized and has lots of very handy maps. I recommend this very, very highly."
5,Highly recommended & exactly what I was looking for.,"The CD arrived in the mail yesterday, and I've listened to it once all the way through. The bird songs were recorded in Wisconsin and I live in Connecticut, and I recognized most of the songs as ones I had heard near my house, so it seems that birds selected for inclusion on the CD are widespread enough to make the CD useful for most of the eastern US.The format is excellent. The bird songs are arranged in alphabetical order by bird name. Each entry begins with about 20 seconds of bird song (usually 2 repetitions) followed by a speaker describing the song in words that are easy to remember and giving the bird's name, and ending with another 5 seconds of bird song. It is easy to tell when one entry has ended and another has begun. I expect to do most of my listening in the car, so this format is perfect for me."
1,Overly Short Songs Presented at Shotgun Speed,"While the coverage of songs is thorough, the acoustic quality is not nearly as good as four other bird song CDs that I also recently purchased (Stokes - Eastern Region, Peterson Field Guide sets - Eastern, Songbirds Bible by Proctor, Common Bird Songs by Borror). Moreover, the songs are very short, with minimal repetition or variation. It is nice to have narration that follows the songs, so the listener has a chance to guess what type of bird sings each song. However, given that the songs are so short, and the pauses after the songs and before narration are even shorter, there is no time for an advanced beginner birder such as myself to reflect, or even spit out the answer instantaneously. Furthermore, the next song often starts virtually ""on top"" of the narration (which is little more than just the name of the bird), making it easy to associate the bird name with the wrong song (ie, the song that follows narration rather than the song that precedes)."
5,Great Training Tool,I use my copy of the Bird Song Ear Training Guide every day in the spring to stay in practice. I set my CD player to shuffle and quiz myself on the way back and forth to work. It has done wonders for my ability to recognize bird songs.This CD plays the bird's song first and then the narrator identifies it and shares a mnemonic to help remember it. This format allows you to test yourself before the song is identified.Thanks John for a great tool!!!
4,Wish it were more comprehensive,"Very good job. Love the mnemonics. I wish it had near the calls that the Stokes and Peterson CD's did. Also, letting us hear the call first, before telling the bird name is great."
4,Makes Learning FUN!,"I had wanted this CD for awhile,and was quite pleased with it, when it came.I enjoy the woman @ the end of each call,mimicking what the bird sounds like in an entertaining way, EX: Free Beer,for the Alder Flycatcher,or Cheeseburger! Cheeseburger! of the Black Capped Chickadee.It makes it easier, in my opinion,to grasp each unique song.This CD is good for young and old birding fans.It is done in a simple, straight forward style.The only ""fault"" I had, was confusion over the cover.It says ""Who Cooks For Poor Sam Peabody?"",and I thought that was an actual representation of a call,and could not find it. In actuality,it is a combo of two bird calls...""Who cooks for you?"",of the Barred Owl, and ""poor Sam Peabody"",of the White Throated Sparrow.Not a big deal,but it may be ""misleading""."
4,GREAT ALBUM,"A VISITING FRIEND FROM THE EAST COAST TURNED ME ON TO THIS CD.I WAS TRULY SURPRISED WITH THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. IT'S RELAXING, CALMING WITH REAL SMOOTH JAZZ SOUNDS. FANTASTIC GUITAR AND KEYBOARD MIXES. HIGHLY RECOMMENED FOR YOUR JAZZ COLLECTION."
4,Depth in Words,"If you want to find yourself or explore in someone elses imagination, then this book is for you! They are not poems to just read and forget and to skim through, you really need to take it in.This is for true poem readers and for anyone else who just wants a change in reading. You'll be inspired in some way I assure you."
5,Imagination,"Imagination Poem related to reality, the loneliness of each kind. A simple meaning and imaginative too. Amazing !"
2,Good Handbook,"This book is exactly what it says, an easy to understand, step-by-step guide to developing an airline business plan.I was required to buy this book as a text for an airline marketing course, it is a lot less effective a tool for a student - I would say spend the extra and get ""Air Transportation"" which has the same general concepts in depth and is a better reference tool. Don't purchase both unless you have money to waste."
2,"wheels up, book down: indeed a waste of money","see comments of Avi8tor.girl: I fully agree.It is more a general guideline for writing business plans with here and there some point to consider wrt airlines. No content related examples. A lot, I repeat, I say I repeat, and I repeat again, of repetition. Book can easily be brought back from 130 pages to about 10 and you won't loose anything. It certainly feels as if the author sees the book as easy money."
5,MUST HAVE!!!!,I read these books a few months ago and LOVED them! They are very interesting and are also very inspiring! It makes you want to really turn to God in your trials. I love these books and would recommend them to all girls ages 9 and up! They are the best books ever!- Heather12-year-old homeschooled girl
3,"OT poor, 24kbps. NT good, 32kbps","New Testament: reasonable qualityOld Testament: overcompressed, telephone quality - no treble or bass(The cassette version is clearly better).(If the last third of the OT had been put on the NT disk, it could have been 32kbps and reasonable quality - less than half of the NT CD is Bible.)If your mp3 player holds only 1 Gig, this is just what you need - under 850Megs for the whole Bible.Alexander Scourby's recording is the gold standard!"
4,Almost Perfect,"This product would get five stars if it only had a ""slow"" speed. It's quite a powerful little thing, and that's primarily why I bought it. It's fabulous at mixing more solid ingredients. However, you may not want to use it for powder-type ingredients unless you thoroughly dampen everything first. It's a flinger! The lowest speed spun about a quarter of my dry ingredients out of the bowl."
5,Deck N Drive Surface Cleaner,"This unit cleans surfaces much faster than using the standard wand, and is light and has comfortable handles for use on vertical surfaces. The pressure adjustment feature is a nice plus since my pressure washer does not have that option. It comes with an adapter for Karcher electric pressure washers as well as many other brands."
3,Not for people with severe mobility problems,"Chair Yoga is a beautiful, peaceful, relaxing DVD. I am a secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patient. Most of my disability is in my legs, therefore I was unable to enjoy all of the leg exercises. This is a great DVD for pregnant people, and people with mild or temporary disabilities, not severe disabilities. I will still watch it, and do whatever I am able to do, and hopefully, see results."
2,Not ideal for people with severe heart problems/ looks good for others,"I purchased this DVD based on the reviews, in hope of finding a good product for someone with heart problems. However, as the DVD does have some more rigorous movements towards the end of the practice, it was not suitable. I gave it to an expectant mother, whom I think this might be more suitable for."
1,No tenho nenhuma critica a falar sobre o produto.,"Moro no Brasil Me chamo Virna Leasy e descidi comprar a camera de fotos porque achei bonita e super barato é esta ai vou comprar obrigado pelo o saite muito bem colocado e espero uma resposta de vocs sobre a minha compra e todo o proscesso. Bay, Bay."
1,The different one is delivered.,"The camera that was sent to me is the next camera.""Polaroid i-zone Translucent Pocket Camera (Phat Blue)""It is very regrettable."
1,"Few pictures, way over-priced","Ordered this ""picture"" book for a friend from Guatelmala. It was nearly $30 and I was very unhappy upon receipt. The book does have a lot of small pictures, but few that actually capture the beauty of Guatemala. The book has more writing than pictures, despite the title ""Guatemala in Pictures"". The book is the size of some children's books and at this cost, I would save the money. It is being returned to Amazon the same day received."
5,"Life's a b*tch, .............","I'm glad I purchased this series. I missed it when it was out! Vic and company was off the hook, totally out of control.....from Shield 1, episode one. I thought ""The Wire"" was bad. Can you imagine living in those areas! They all kinda tie in together, though, from rogue cops to corrupt politicians. and sprinkled in between, is the ordinary citizen who has to put up with all that fraggle naggle. Phew!!!!"
5,absolutely amazing,"Season 2 amazed me by being even better that season 1. The Shield is the only show with enough balls to give the people the cops we would love to have. If there were real cops like Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis' character), I really think things would be a lot better. Then again...maybe there's a reason I'm not a cop, and that Mackey's a fictional character."
5,Wow!,"This show is amazing. I have to admit however, that I missed Season 1 completely and although I started to watch Season 2, I missed a few episodes in a row so I quit watching it becasue I wanted to see the action as it unfolded, not be informed about who Mackey took a bribe from and then beat up in the ""Previously on The Shield..."" clips. You know what I mean right? Anyway, I'm going to buy Season 1 and Season 2 on DVD and watch them back to back. The characters are very likable, each with their unique view on how Mackey goes about doing his job. ""The Shield"" is simply phenomenal. I highly recommend it."
4,Police story,Surprisingly in-grasping story of corrupt American policeman and his tireless fight with crime endless surrounding-in the USA and Mexico neighbouring.
3,No compatible with cards over 512mb,I owned one of these for compact flash worked great.Bought this one for my new digital camera and found out that it doesn't support anything above 512mb. Too bad it wasn't listed on the item at amazon.com.Tech support from Sandisk is the one who informed me of the limitation after struggling to get the PC Card to work correctly.Probably works great for anything 512mb and under.
4,Sandisk Media Card Review,"Received unit and had no problems with getting it setup on my Dell laptop. It was recongnized by the Dell operating system and works well doing what it is supposed to do. The only negative comment I have is I wish the media cards themselves could pop back out by the common method of pushing the media card in slightly and having a spring pop it out. Because the Sandisk adapter fits completely inside the laptop (desired), it makes the media card itself hard to extract without the benefit of a pop out type assist. A secondary comment might be price as there are lower cost options on the street. However, these may not operate without other issues."
2,Still need another adapter for Memory Stick Duo,"You cannot put a Memory Stick Pro Duo Card in this without first inserting the duo into the larger Memory stick adapter. So you have to either leave your memeory stick adapter inside it all the time and take it out whenever you need to insert an SD or other card type, or risk not having it and not being able to use it with your memory stick duo.The second bad thing is that, at least for Memory stick/Duo if you have a Dell laptop, you have to eject and re-insert the whole PC card for it to recognize the memory card you inserted, which is annoying; not sure if this is Sandisk's or Dell's fault."
3,It works but design could be better,"To remove a card after inserted, you must eject the Card Adapter from the computer."
4,Sandisk reader,"I got this so that my laptop, which came without a memory card reader, could always be ready to read these ubiquitous cards. It would have been nice if this card could also handle compact flash, but I have never seen any other brands with them combined. I give it 4 stars because this does what its supposed to do, and it would have been a 5 if it had CF capability."
3,It works for some but not others.,"I bought this product at the same time as my xD 1 gig (type M). Well, when I just got off the phone with Sandisk, this model will never work with Type M xD and there are no plans to patch the PC Card adpater.Why didn't they just put in the disclaimer ""Does Not Work With Type M xD Memory""????It was a lot of work trying to find the right adaptor, a lot of time wasted..."
2,POWERBOOK USERS: AVOID!,"I bought this 6-in-1 because it was the cheapest PCMCIA reader I could find that could read SD cards. Turns out it is a total loss in my PowerBook G4 ""Aluminum"" because it is near impossible to eject. There are tiny metal tabs (somewhat loose, I might add) that catch on the side of the PowerBook's PCMCIA slot. It is worth noting that the card fits and ejects just fine in my roomate's Dell, so it may be a situation where this works fine in most computers, but not those built exactly to spec (or those without a little wiggle room).That said, I also gave the card a poor rating because it is hard to insert memory into the 6-in-1 slot. SD cards go in kinda crooked and you have to use too much force to line them up with the reader. Overall, I don't recommend this product."
3,Wish they would have mentioned.....,"Wanted an adapter so I wouldn't have to plug my camera to usb port. Tried it out and my computer recognized the devise as being present..but it wouldn't assign it a drive. Got a hold of technical support and the person was hard to understand and was getting too technical. Then I remembered from one of the earlier reviewers, that if you insert a memory card of 1.0GB..it might not work. Sure enough that's what the problem was when the device worked with a memory card less than 1.0 GB. Wish the manufacturer would emphasize this point. Other than that..very happy with it."
1,Insufficient info,"product would have been great, IF, it was what i needed and expected. more size, shape, compatibility info would have been helpful. while i did get timely shipping/refund service, i lost money in the process."
1,San Disck 6-in-1,The card arrived on time in a well packed box. I tried to use but the card did not owrk on my computer. I have another Sna Disck card with Flsh memmory card and it is working fine. I don't know why the purchased cardis not working.
3,SDAD-67-A10 Does what it says but slow,"I found that when I used a USB 2.0 card in my pcmcia and connected a USB 2.0 card reader to it, I was able to pass files three times faster than with this item plugged into my pcmcia. But it did work and had no touble installing it."
1,The worst Sandisk adapter that I ever had,"I really like the sandisk product... but this PC Card adapter is the worst pcmcia card adapter that I ever had. I have only TWO WEEKS with this item and I DON'T KNOW how this thing stops to work... simply the slot is obstructed with the own pins... This item is VERY DELICATE and I'm a very care full person... lamentably I live outside of the United States, so I can't do nothing... I want my money back!!!... this thing doesn't work!... sincerely only for paperweight..."
1,San Disk 6 in 1 PC Card Adapter,"Initially I liked and enjoyed the adapter. It allowed me to us a digital card to listen to music in the car. However, it no longer works and I will be exchanging it."
5,It works out even better than I would have anticipated,"I just received the SanDisk 6-in-1 PC Card Adapter yesterday. Today I plug in it a 4GB SD card and use it in my car. It works out perfectly with the Command system in my Mercedes Benzs E300. With a 4GB SD it carries 20 sets of opera, 6 sets of Broadway musicals, and many other jazz music that I frequently listen to. Now, with more than 60 hours of music there, I also have 6 DVD/CD slots left to play any additional. Your car dealer may offer you some pcmcia memory card with 16GB or 32GB at the price around US$150 to US$200 a unit. Don't do it. At US$32 a piece, SanDisk 6-in-1 Card Adapter is a much better solution for you. You can get it from Amazon within just a few days after placing your order."
4,Quite a handy ...,"... gadget for us who have more than one sort of card to read. Works fine, no problems under Debian GNU/Linux on a ThinkPad."
5,This has great Quality for the money!,Well I bought this camera hoping to get a good one finally. And it turns out that I love it. It has a beatiful picture quality. For a 8 mega pixle that works as good as this I don't think you would find a better price. And it's also very easy to opperate.
5,Great Camera,"This is a great camera at an exceptional price. It's compact and the LCD screen is a nice size. I'm not an expert when it comes to electronics, but this camera is very easy to use and the pictures are beautiful! Highly recommend to anyone."
4,Spiritual warfare DOES exist,"I am writing this mainly in response to those who believe spiritual warfare does not exist today and that therefore there is no need for books like this one. True, God is omnipotent, but Satan is still, through the fall of Adam, the prince of this world. God's omnipotence is exercised in his eternal plan, though it may not seem apparent from today's point of view. Part of God's plan is to use Christians in the field of spiritual battle. God's omnipotence guarantees victory, but does not prevent battles from taking place.For examples of spiritual warfare, read about missionaries out in the field or intercessors who's prayers have resulted in supernatural healing and protection."
5,The Battle Is the Lord's,I am familiar with the books written by Tony Evans. He is an excellent communicator in his field. The book is very interesting and needs the reader to be thoughtful and digest the message. Diane Poenie

2,Ugh!,"Though gorgeously recorded on a very attractive piano, rarely have I heard such fussy, mannered playing. It's just loaded with sophomoric expressiveness -- contrived swells and subito pianos all over the place, even lost inaudible cadences because he plays so softly that the hammers barely touch the strings. I want to shout, ""just play the notes!"" Such playing makes ""molto espressivo"" seem a nauseating term. Clearly this man wants to set his ""stamp"" on Mozart. With a rather heavy and gauche boot. Remarkably bad. Almost anybody's Mozart is better than this."
3,Check the contact configuration before you order,"I thought that this switch would work for my 10-year old Craftsman Garden Tractor [Model # 917275285].While the NUMBER of contacts is correct, the CONFIGURATION didn't match the one I needed.HINT: Check the picture AND description carefully before ordering, and you'll probably end up with a fine switch (I ended up ordering the correct one the second time around)."
1,A guide to increasing publisher profits,"The way to maximize the profits of a book is to sell the book without placing any useful information in the book. A perfect example of that is ""The Casino Management Handbook"""
2,Race City Z,"Well the product that I got, was not the product that was pictured in the photo on Amazon.So I ended up with a hood scoop that is three(3) times bigger than I wanted.The scoop that was shipped is well made, but it is to large for vehicle, what I wanted to use it on!!!So my thoughts are,""what you see maybe not what you get"", since this was a first time buy on Amazon,I don't know if I'll buy again?"
2,clunky translation,"When I read ""Death and the Penguin"", I found myself carried along by the prose, even when nothing much was happening. This time, even though it's the same translator, the prose was clunky and graceless. It's still Kurkov, but I keep stubbing my mental toes on phrases that just don't belong in an English sentence. A shame. I really liked ""Death and the Penguin""."
4,A Solid Sequel,"While not as breathtaking as Kurkov's orginal ""Death and the Penguin"", this sequel was still highly amusing and captivating. After Viktor abandons his pet penguin to save himself at the end of the last novel, ""Penguin Lost"" picks up with Viktor trying to make ammends for his earlier actions. A great book, but you should read ""Death and the Penguin"" first, if you want to follow the plot."
5,Wonderful product!,Thank you Bones Skate! You have made it very easy and a non time consuming way to clean skateboard bearings.
4,Gets the job done. Essential tool.,"I don't think I can say I could go on without this product. It has helped me so much and is so easy to use that I can honestly say that it is an essential tool for my skating. Buy it. It looks cheap, it isn't..I've stepped on this bottle, its been crammed into bag after bag..shoved into storage, kicked, beat up..and still looks like new. It just works. get it."
3,Overpriced and didn't seem to do much,"This works as you would expect, though I thought $10 was a little much. I noticed that it didn't work magically either...there was still plenty of work involved to really get the bearings clean. I eventually just took them completely apart to clean them thoroughly as they didn't get super clean just sitting on the bolt in the solvent."
2,Looks nice but not so practical,"This product seems great on the surface, but was actually not very practical for me because it only holds 8 bearings as designed if I remember correctly. ( I gave mine away) I often need to clean 2 or more sets of bearings at a time so this is just too slow. I've found that spinning the bearings in solvent is more efficient for removing contaminants than just shaking them when held staticly anyway. You can remove bearings from any container with a tiny telescoping magnet from Auto-Zone ($1.99) Bones does however ,make fabulous bearings!"
4,hrm,It won't fit all 8 bearings on the device! not to mention it's nearly impossible to not find a non water based cleaner! :) but other than that it's nice
5,convenient,This bearing cleaning kit makes a tedious job quick and easy. Just buy acetone and clean up your bearings. Convenient!
2,You get what you pay for...,"There's a reason they're not showing the top of the box in the pictures. There's a huge (about 1.5"" X 2.5"") embossed Watch Pavillion logo on the top of the box. :-/The interior is tan by the way, not grey as in the pictures. The leather is shiny and looks like vinyl. The toolkit is as advertised, though the tools appear to be cobbled together from various manufacturers or products lines (IE the screwdrivers are not from the same line). No biggie, but looks a little homebrewed.I guess the bottom line is that there's a reason you're getting a 12 watch case with the toolkit for $65. If you intend to use this to display your Timex collection, you'll love it. If you want to put your Breitlings, IWCs, Panerais in it, it's probably not for you. I fit neither of these groups, but I sent it back. Fair warning..."
3,Helpful Customer Service,"Although I received the product in the incorrect color, I contacted the customer service department and they promptly contacted me. They didn't have the color I ordered originally, but were nice enough to give me a discount to keep the one I received. The box itself was nice and my husband liked it. The product was received on the day it was expected."
3,Nice but came broken,It's nice but when I got it the drawer was broken. I requested a new one which they sent. That one also was defected but I just replaced the drawer in the first one I received and that worked. Other than that my husband liked it.
3,Watch Box,"I thought it was a very nice watch box and well worth the money, but my only complaint is that the little bronze plating by the lock was all scratched up. I wasn't very happy about that."
4,Watch Box Storage Chest,I was very pleased with the arrival of my new Watch Storage Box. It was packed well and makes a nice enhancement to the decor of the room.
3,Does not perform well,"Pros- dimensions very close to Glock 17 so I can use it for training. Nice feel, works well...sometimesCons- very inconsistent performance. Many times gas blows out in excess. Don't get many mags, out of one filling with gas. Springs are extremely week. sometimes bbs don't load, slide very weak. Finally magazine sometimes has trouble locking in and slide won't go forward when pressing latch. You have to actually pull it back to let it out.When it works its great, but very iffy and inconsistent."
4,Beyond Oasis -- the definitive Zelda for the Sega Genesis,"Barring Landstalker, which later gave rise to the Sega Saturn's Dark Savior, and influenced the EXCELLENT PSX title Alundra, Beyond Oasis is THE definitive Zelda title/action role-playing game on the Sega Genesis. I bought this used about a month or two ago from amazon.com marketplace and am thrilled with the game. Simple but illustrated black and white instruction booklet, along with the same cheap packaging of other late Sega Genesis games cannot hide the fact that a great game series was in the working. Colorful bosses, and challenging puzzles, in addition to a Prince of Persia-meets-Zelda theme give this game real personality, and elevate it head and shoulders over other Zelda-clones on the market. Too bad the game was only followed by one sequel (1996's LEgend of Oasis) before sega stopped producing game machines. All in all, I'm happy to be able to play this one from time to time, and Beyond Oasis is one of the last great Genesis games."
4,One of the last best Genesis games,"Beyond Oasis combined action & adventure elements, hack & slash dynamics, and RPG elements to make this one of the last best games for the Genesis. When I play Beyond Oasis now it kind of reminds me of Sword of the Berserk: Guts' Rage for the Dreamcast, which is kind of weird considering the time lapse between the games. The graphics are pretty good; the animation runs smooth, some of the smoothest on the Genesis, but the control is rather awkward when trying to pull off some of the special attack moves. There are secrets abound in the game, many of which take a lot of skill to find, but you will find yourself engrossed in Beyond Oasis once you get used to it. If you have a Genesis and like action or RPG's then I strongly suggest looking for Beyond Oasis wherever you can find it. Also recommended are the two best Genesis games on the system; Phantasy Star 2 and Gunstar Heroes."
2,Disjointed,I am working with a student required to read Neverwhere and I thought this might help clarify the confusions for him. The graphics are appealing but the story is even more disjointed . I also found it confusing with information for links between episodes lost.
5,Awesome Game,This is the coolest game. It's my 2nd favorate sega game. These monsters are taking over the world and you need to find the legendary equipment. Once you do that you find this space station with all of the prev bosses as mini-bosses and then you fight this really hard machine. Its so hard i havent beaten the game. This is the perfect game for an RPG lover! I wonder why its under action and not RPG?
2,See the website! (don't) Rad the book!,"I first came across Millington's website a couple of years ago when I did a Lycos search for something. I have long since forgotten what I was searching for, but the title of his website (It's the same as the book) intrigued me. I spent an enjoyable hour reading the enties there, and got a kick out of how he and Margaret could find some of the most inane things to bicker over.Flash forward to last week. I ran across the book while browsing the new book section and decided to read it. The same inane bickering is here, but it is padded by one of the most ridiculous plot contrivances I have ever seen in a novel.If you can stand the padding, be my guest. Its my suggestion that you skip over the plot and just read the arguments. That's the only valuable effort this book has to show."
5,Smashingly good fun...!,"I don't know why you'd rank this book under 4 stars, unless you were a fan of the website and was expecting more non-fiction tales such as are found there. I had this expectation, and for a page or two was disappointed. Then, as I continued to read, I got more and more hooked.The only drawback to this book is that the ending seemed a bit rushed-all things wrap up in a crazy 5 page car chase, with a stop for an accidental brush with sex.Other than that, it was funny, and it reminded me to not take things too seriously in life-heck, EVERYONE has the same darned arguments!"
1,blah,"What a waste of the second half of my vacation week. Hateful, annoying people bickering all over the place. A convoluted, ridiculous plot that manages to be very boring. I also wished it would just return to Ursula and Pel's bickering rather than any of the workplace stuff, and yet when it got back to a bickering scene, I wanted that to end, too. These people deserve each other, but I don't deserve this."
1,Appalling waste of talent and paper,"Do you enjoy reading about toxic relationships between spineless pedants and abusive harpies with absolutely no redeeming characteristic or indeed anything in common? Then this book is for you!If, however, you don't find domestic abuse funny in anything more than small abstract doses - as in the author's web log of the same title - then avoid this sloppy and self indulgent semi-autobiographical mess.It's poorly written, shoddily edited, thoroughly depressing, and terminates abruptly and unsatisfyingly. There is humor in here, but it's not even black, more of a tedious muddy gray color.Avoid, avoid, avoid."
4,Good for a chuckle or two,"By the owner/creator of the hysterical website of the same name.Unlikely story of Pel, who works in an Enlish university library. When hisboss suddenly disappears - as in skips town - Pel is thrown into his position -while still expected to hold his old job, too. And suddenly he finds himselfdealing with the Triads, who apparently have a regular transaction ongoingwith the uni. Add to the mix one more job Pel is expected to fill... Ohyeah, and his girlfriend Ursula, who never agrees with Pel on anything.Amusing farce, well written and very clever. I enjoyed this one."
5,Mil,This is by far an original. I encourage anybody with a witty sense of humor to start thier Mil Millington collection of novels with this book. I wish he could write faster so I could get a novel every month from him.
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,"I, too, ""discovered"" Mil Millinton on the web and proceeded immediately to purchase all of his novels. His self-depricating dry wit is exactly the kind of humor I adore.I hear that this novel may become a movie and it has the potential to be way funnier than Bridget Jones! Bring it on!"
4,Excellent book on packing,"As with all Chic Simple books, this little book is filled with good advice, beautiful pictures, interesting quotes and a nice attitude. It addresses questions such as what should I bring, how much should I bring and why should I bring anything at all? It also discusses different kinds of bags, and when they are appropriate. Not only is this book about packing for travels - it is about how to pack to commute to work or going to the gym as well.Details about how to pack clothes and how to build a travel wardrobe are also included, plus some very good lists to use as starting points, as well as a packing chart to personalize."
2,"Great piece, lousy retailer","The piece is beautiful, great for deserts or other individual servings of dishes. Wonderful if you have vegetarian or vegan friends and you want to make variations of the main dish for them.This arrived with a chip on one of the leaves. It was a holiday present and I did not inspect it before wrapping. When we discovered that it was damaged, we tried to exchange it. After numerous un-answered voice mail and email messages, we were informed that it was past the 14 day period that they allowed for exchanges.Lovely piece, but try to find it from someone other than The Kitchen Clique."
4,No cast iron in this berry,"I was mostly pleased but a little surprised when my blueberry Le Creuset mini-casserole arrived. It's as cute as a bug, totally adorable -- though I haven't figured out what I'll use it for, I just like it. However, I'd somehow assumed it would have a cast-iron core with the ceramic as an overlay, as the big le Creuset cook-pots have. BAAMP! Nope! If I'd read the description more carefully, I'd have realized this. You can even put this blueberry into the microwave, because there is NO CAST IRON inside. It's too small and funny-shaped to use on the stove, so maybe I should have realized?I can imagine a kitchen with a row of these crocks lined up on a high shelf or whatever (the punkin, the strawberry, etc. etc.) just for cuteness' sake! So could the designers at Le Creuset, I suppose."
2,Cute but frustrating,"Le Creuset Stoneware Petite Blueberry Casserole is absolutely adorable, but I baked apples in them and was very frustrated with trying to get the ""lids"" off and on for basting/checking for doneness, especially when they are hot. They baked my apples wonderfully, they were delicious, but I am simply not sure whether to use them again or not, because in the process I burned my wrist in the oven and chipped the top of the ""blueberry"" when I jerked my arm back.So sad ; )"
3,Great Show Bad DVD Quality,I love the show but every dvd in this set/season was bad. It kept freezing throught the show and would un freeze cutting out parts of the episodes. So far I have not seen this problem with the other seasons that I have purchased.
5,"It was a gift, but I have not head there was any problems with it.","This was a gift for my 15 year old grandson, and I hear he loves it. I personally have no knowledge of it, other than that."
4,Templates - not rotary cutting instructions,"This book was written before rotary cutters,I guess. There are templates for every block. Most of the blocks finish fairly large 12""- 15"". Instructions are given with each telling how many to use for a particular size quilt. Each block pattern is rated as to the degree of difficulty.There are no color photos, but the blocks are shown colored with ink to indicate where lights and darks should be used for the best effect. Drawings are of blocks only - not full quilts.As another reviewer mentioned - there are some block patterns here that you wont find in the newer quilting books, giving you the opportunity to create more traditional looking quilts (like the title says, lol).Overall a good instruction book....but not one you just look through for eye candy. Those with a little experience will not have a problem figuring out how to cut block pieces with a rotary cutter."
2,Over-rated and over-priced,"I was disappointed with this book. I didn't learn anything new from reading this book, which was really disappointing. For the price, it's just not thorough. There are many other books on the subject that offer the same advice and are a better value for your money. If I'd have had the chance to flip through this first I would not have spent the money on this book. Over-rated and over-priced."
3,"Durable, works well enough","I bought this pitch pipe because it was the only GDAE pipe I could find that wasn't plastic. So far it seems fairly durable and the pitches are all decent. E is great, but on the lower tones I've found that I have to blow very gently -- blowing too hard (which is not really that hard at all) easily sends the pitch sharp."
5,Much better then the first one IMHO,"Remember Streets of Rage? If liked that one, you will most certainly love this one. It follows the same theme as the first one, but with some updates. First of the game play is much better! You no longer have the police car helping you with his rocket launcher, but you do have some more killer moves which help a lot in tight situations. The music is VERY good. I can't ever seem to forget the theme song from the amusement park! Graphics are way improved, plus you get to see how much ""life"" your enemies have left (in other words they have their own energy meters.) PLUS you have extra characters (other then Adam) like Skate and Max. So..go ahead and get this game. You won't regret it!"
5,Excellent beat em' up action!,"best one in my opinion better than the 1st and 3rd one. inhanced graphics, easier enemies (no return of the 5th lvl bosses from the 1st one the two girls that were hard to hit but they return on the 3rd one. 3rd ones pretty hard too) great lvls, better character combos (and know have special moves) and great gameplay. Highly recommended for BEAT EM' UP FANS."
1,Does not work for Motorola V60i,I purchased this for my Motorola cell phone (V60i) and it is thicker than the original battery. The back cover on the phone will not go on so the battery is the wrong size.
3,Solid storytelling. Rich alien culture.,"Where Prodigy was lacking, Earth Herald more than makes up for. The world Jan Clark creates here is both rich and engrossing. Thee boos are big blue creatures that talk in metaphors and math... an odd combination. Auries resemble big Scotsman with bibbets on their foreheads that act as mood rings. I especially loved the RadiMo character that lives in a whack-a-mole box, popping out of various holes, and eventually playing the game with the help of a laser gun. One commenter said that Rieka was a whiner which I find strange. She spent more time kicking butt than anyone else in the story. I must have missed the part he was referring to. Great story. Too bad it's Jan Clark's last one."
1,Not what I'd hoped for,"Reika got under my skin so badly that I was unable to even finish this book. At first I was a little broadsided by the fact that this turns out to be the second of a duology, but figured nothing about it on the cover had suggested as much, that I could probably proceed with caution. Perhaps it's because I didn't read the first one that I just can't stand Reika. She comes off as a spineless whiner who's just kind of lost in life, regardless of her new position. I could only handle so much of this behavior before I threw in the towel."
5,If your spirit longs to fly,"A rare book I keep re-reading, it is at the same time haunting and nurturing, fantastic and familiar. The protagonist, Sephony, has long since outgrown her husband, whom she married in obedience to her controlling parents. She aches for intellectual growth and emotional connection in a partly Huxleyesque future England that discourages both. From her isolation, a man appears and urges her to follow him to a different reality. Among his people she experiences caring, sensitivity, and truth -- normal attributes there, as is being able to fly. She longs to remain in his world, but cannot. Returning to London, she must re-make her life in light of truths she was blind to before. I was particularly touched by Sephony's re-visioning of her relationships with her adolescent daughter and with her own mother. And when Marder's characters fly, my spirit soars!"
1,"Mystical, but Missing","Chronicles of Air and Dreams: A Novel of Mexico by Rosa Martha Villarreal uses the mysticism of the Mayan pyramids, the jaguar, and voices on the wind and in dreams to create a patchwork of current events interrelated with the history of Martin Cortez and his family curse. There are many visions threaded throughout several characters, but the problem is that the story is told by the writer rather than shown by the people who are experiencing the events. This type of story telling leaves many unanswered questions and loses the emotional impact of the reader becoming involved with or caring about the characters or the story. I had a very difficult time finishing the book."
2,"Uh, no.","Any marley compilation with only ten tracks to its name should be considered with the highest suspicion, and this collection proves why. Even for a label-specific collection, it's grossly underwhelming and any reggae-neophyte probably has this stuff already.Even at this price, it's not worth the money."
4,This is not a toy but,"a cute,ceramic figurine of a white kitten. It is tiny and adorable, but as is breakable,so is not a toy."
4,Touching,"When I first started reading this book, I was a little skeptical about Raymond's caharacters' actions. I debated whether I should have read on and I was so glad I did. The book, for me, was profoundly touching and inspired some ideas for my own novel. I agree with IPB@mindspring. The last chapter was simply the best ending to a heartwarming tale. The story-swapping old women in the novel were real as well as their stories and I got a sense of how their stories had affected them as they grew older. Raymond painted a fine picture there. This book won a book award because it deserved it. The Kirkus review was a bit harsh but in the end, everyone is entitled to their own opinions. My opinion is that the book did what it was suppoosed to do: it touched at least a few of us and told a good story."
1,Try the Annie Brand instead!,"These rollers are so flimsy and aren't as sturdy as the Annie brand mesh rollers. If you really want mesh rollers, go with Annie. They are much better!"
3,"1 1/2"" Mesh Rollers",The rollers work but do not really dry the hair as many other rollers from the past. It is the type of material that is used in the rollers.
1,Misrepresentation,"I searched for ""brush rollers."" This is what came up. They look like brush rollers, but when I received them, there was no brush inside any of the rollers. Useless junk."
1,Disappointing product,"These rollers are difficult to use and do not stay in. I thought they would have brushes inside the mesh or at least that the surface would be such that the hair would cling to it. They are worthless. I'm throwing them away, and would never buy them again."
1,Diane Mesh Hair Rollers,"Diane Mesh Hair rollers, are really heavy, so keeping them in your hair and on your head is a challenge, and frankly not worth the effort, especially if you have fine hair. Maybe it's because I bought the largest size possible, but I I thought they were ineffective and not worth the hassle so I chucked them. Maybe they work better if you have coarse hair, or super long hair or something, but for me they were a definite No."
2,Mesh Rollers,"These are ""ok"", but each roller was heavy in weight and needed to be adequately secured in place. It was my own error in mistaking the ""mesh"" rollers for ""brush"" rollers (which I really needed). The mesh rollers are heavy wire coils covered with plastic mesh. If this is what you're wanting, then you're in busines. However, if you're needing lightweght brush rollers, these aren't the ones."
5,It's a Sega!,"It feels so good to go retro. Since I don't have a the console for this controller, I got an adapter to use it from RetroUSB.com. I play games on my computer with this old school controller! Just the way I remember it!!"
2,Not As Promised,"Product was marked up and written in, although seller represented that it was ""like new""."
5,I've been looking for this for years!,"I too had this book in the 70s. Bought it in 74, and referred to it all the time, whenever I had a few pounds to lose. It has such a rich collection of wonderful diets. Get tired of one, start another. I lost the book sometime in the late 80s, during a move. Now I can have it back again. God Bless you Amazon."
2,Great book... poor printing,This book is a one of a kind... it is a must have for those who want to know what cells and tissues look like in life...the artist is a genius.Unfortunately the reproduction is very poor and I would recommend not buying this book.Buy an older one and contact the publisher as I plan to do... encourage them to republish the book in such a way which does justice to the artworkThanksA
5,Worked like a charm,The builder didn't use sizing on the walls before puttig up wall papaer. This took it down no problem. There were 1 or 2 pesky sheets that required a little more time and mist but they came down as well. You may want to invest in a manual spray bottle as the power one included with this kit doesn't hold the charge as long as needed.
2,Not easy to use,"I had a very bad experience with this textbook in my Spanish class at school. While it is very easy to do well on the accompanying tests, it is also easy to escape without learning very much Spanish at all. The main drawback is that the book uses much of its vocabulary without ever having officially introduced it. Then, when you go look words up in the back to find out what they mean, they aren't there! Further, although topics are introduced in logical order, they are not organized in the chapters in a standard format. This makes it difficult to locate a previous concept if you wish to review it.I have found so many other Spanish products that are much better. I would not, therefore, recommend this one."
2,Not recommended,This textbook makes it very hard to learn the vocabulary because they do not define the words they use. Many of the directions for the exercises are confusing. The culture sections are decent and contain contemporary pop culture. I find the textbook to be of very little value.
3,Ok Bart,I do not know if it was the seller or the product but the Bart I bought was different than the one in the picture. The head extends above where the hair is which looks completely off. His lips are smashed together like a mummy. The rest of the body is good though.
4,A most un usual cd,"I found Suggs on the Avengers soundtrack. Intrigued I sought the actual CD that the song came from. I must say I was not sorry to have bought it. It is definate mood music, and is entertaining. I would recomend it for anyone who likes a good male vocalist, and neat music..."
5,Excellent source for herbal treatments,"This source book is excellent for the beginning layperson to use herbs as supplements for his/her health care. Spices were not included. For example, garlic tea is excellent against food poisoning."
5,Drink tea to your health,Have a stomach ache? PMS? Then this book is what you need. the natural way of making and drinking tea is in this book of herbs for teas. The origins and properties of these herbs are explained. A natural way to enhance your health. This is cross-referenced to find out any symtom or name of herb. I read a book where the characters where always drinking Red Clover tea and I went to this book to find out that red clover is good for coughs and dry scalp. There is a wealth of information packed in this little book.
4,"Good, but be careful..","This book was extremely informative and very well set up. Everything is straightforward and it is very easy to locate exactly what you are looking for. This was my first book on teas and I understood everything that was said, no technical jargon. With that said, many of the herbs used in this book do not have the proper warnings or listings of what medications they cannot be used with. Also, a few of these have been proved to be carcinogens when ingested so be sure to research the herbs before following these instructions. It turns out, that since I am on birth control, I cannot utilize 85% of the remedies in this book, so be wary if you are on any kind of prescription that requires a delicate balance as this book may prove to be useless unless you want to use herbs in EVERY area of your life."
4,"20,000 Secrets of Tea","Victoria Zak's book includes herbal tea history, remedies,directions on making your own teas,detailed lists of herbs + ailments to treat.She lists herbs with cautions as well as parts of plant to use in making tea along with historical facts about many herbs. Recipes and quotes make this book an interesting read + educational reference to your herbal tea library."
5,Had I known,"Had I known about this book a few years ago, I would have saved myself a great deal of time and expense on teas that don't really ""do"" anything. This book teaches how to choose and blend herbs not only for flavor, but also for function. I was never interested in blending my own, but thought what were on store shelves were the best way to go. Not necessarily so. I've created some of the most flavorful and functional teas I've ever tasted and enjoyed - because of this book."
5,Brilliant little book!,"Such a brilliant book, small yet encompasses so much information in an enjoyable-to-read manner. A constant go-to, and a must have for tea-lovers!"
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book, but I don't know if I'll be using as much as I thought I would. I don't have most of the herbs on hand at any given moment. Some of them would be difficult to find in a pinch. The basic ones I have, but some of the uncommon ones are things that I've never even had in my house."
5,I love tea,Very informative book about the benefits of tea. I have been drinking tea for over fifty years and this book has been very informative.
4,Made me want to buy loose leaf tea to try all the different flavors and aromas that can be had.,I found this book interesting and learned a lot. I will be brewing my own tea instead of using tea bags in no time at all. First I have to decide on which one to try.
4,Ringmax does the job,"For people who are frustrated by not being able to hear the phone ring, the Ringmax may make a difference. It has various types of tones and volume controls that help the hard-of-hearing be aware of a ringing phone. [For people with normal hearing, when you are near the device it will be a shock everytime it rings because the volume can be set high.] Since the unit does not come with a short (""pigtail"") connector, but instead a long connctor, if used along with a wall phone you may have to wire the Ringmax directly to the phone itself, rather than use the longer line. It would be simpler if they supplied a short connector as well, or if you purchase one at a Radio Shack. We have two Ringmax units now. One in the kitchen and one in the bedroom."
4,the other side,This is a great source if you wish to see what the other side thought about the Constitution.Anything by Patrick Henry is golden.
1,Don't get this edition. Font is SMALL!!!!!,"I don't mind reading a page or so using a magnifying glass, but the whole book? We're talking small print here. So small that I finally threw it into the dumpster.Is/are the Fed Papers & Anti-Fed Papers knowable? Over the years I've purchased many copies and still can't make heads or tails out of the convoluted writing. I always thought Shakespeare was complicated, but this stuff is like a foreign language. And the ""Fed Papers in Modern Language"" isn't much better.Sorry for the rant."
4,Psychopath or Moral Crusader?,"I became riveted to this movie after catching some of it on TV, prompting purchase of the DVD. The theme is well described elsewhere here.Initally all my sympathy was with the protagonist, Kenzo Okuzaki, fearlessly rooting out and confronting the wartime executioners. But, even with much material edited out, it quickly became obvious that the man was mentally imbalanced and a murderer himself. It is also not clear why he took nearly 40 years to start pursuing the officers and men shown in this piece, wasted his youth making pathetic gestures towards the Emperor and killing someone not related to this story (and spending a long time in jail as a result).To answer my own question in the review title - both!"
4,Security Officer Training Manual,"The book had a lot of good and useful information, however, it was published 14 years ago. Many things have not changed, but an update might be in order."
5,The Greatest Book Ever Written,"As the title suggests, ""It Is The Greatest Book Ever Written!""Maybe not for Baptists but for anyone with an open mind it is, at the same time, farcical, hysterical, insightful and existential.I humbly suggest you buy da damn book now!It went outta print in the '80's or so and I treasured my 3 or 4 tattered, page worn, funky old paperbacks. Even went so far as to scan the pig in to my hard drive.Desparate men resort to desparate measures.All seriousness aside (Simon Wagstaff might, maybe have trouble with that), the book is fabulous!You like to laugh?Read it.You like absurdity?Read it.You like to ponder 'important' stuff like existence?Read it.And come away laughing like hell.Seriously, Baptists will not like this book!"
1,Not what I expected,"This seems more like someone trying to write like Kurt Vonnegut, this is not Kurt Vonnegut, it is Philip Jose Farmer. If I knew this I would have purchased a real Vonnegut book."
1,A Feeble Hoax,"In case you're still not sure, this is NOT a book by Kurt Vonnegut. Unless you've already read everything by Vonnegut several times and are still craving more, don't waste your time with this deep space twaddle. If you want to read something by Kilgore Trout, pick up God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, one of Vonnegut's best, which contains summaries of some of Trout's greatest hits."
4,More like 3 1/2 stars actually,"Good, but not (is it) great. I wanted (just) a little more humor, perhaps something along the lines of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is one of my (me) favorites of all time. If you're a fan of (or) that series, I would still suggest you read Venus on the Half-Shell. There are (is) not that many -- or at least I have a hard time finding (rating) many -- books that combine humor and sience fiction. I think the length, however, was perfect, at about 200 pages. Not too long that (the reviewer) will get bored, even if it (a) was slightly (very)disappointing. And, of course, on the very first page is one of my favorite (bad) lines in a book: something to the effect of, ""The universe is a very big place, perhaps the biggest."" I love that line (idea?)...."
2,"Not the greatest book I have ever read, but still enjoyable.","Although this wasn't the greatest of science fiction books every written I am glad to have it as a part of my library considering I am trying to collect all kurt vonnegut books that are (or were) available. This is, for the most part, how I'd expect a Kilgore Trout book to be written. Don't expect much from it and you'll enjoy it."
3,Not Quite Trout,"This novel had been given a lot of hype by a cousin of mine, I found it not worthy. I am a Vonnegut fan and hoped something bearing the name Kilgore Trout would contain the vision and originality that I've tasted by reading Vonnegut. What I've learned of Trout gave me every confidence that any novel of his would be eternally amusing and innovative, ""Venus on the Half Shell"" was not that. It dragged, it was sometimes boring, it was very similar to many other books I have read. But it was good, good but not great. And great is the only thing Kilgore Trout can be."
4,For real Vonnegut collectors,"Definitely not an intelligent novel. Anyone who expects this to be a Vonnegut book will be sorely dissappointed. But I'm a huge Vonnegut fan and I thought it read just like a Kilgore Trout novel should. It was bad stylistically, it was rife with blatant sexual innuendo-- but the ideas were worthwhile, and that's exactly how Vonnegut has described Trout's books and stories. I think the real author did an excellent job of replicating the style of a fictional bad writer. If you're into Vonnegut, this is a must-have to complete your collection."
2,Better imagined than read.,"Since Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. claimed to have freed all of his literary characters in 1973's _Breakfast of Champions_, on the surface it seems only reasonable that Kilgore Trout should begin producing books on his own. But, like the movie monster that is only scary while it remains unseen, the ""reality"" of Trout is better imagined than read._Venus on the Half-Shell_ is a terrific pastiche of Vonnegut's writing style and Trout's half-baked science fiction plots, but too many ideas and too little plot make a story that simply isn't worth the effort. I can't imagine this book inspiring Eliot Rosewater to suggest that Trout should be President of the United States. Perhaps this book is why Vonnegut ultimately reclaimed Trout as a character in _Galapagos_ and _Timequake_.Besides, it can't really be a Kilgore Trout novel when the cover art isn't half-obscured by a lurid blurb for ""Wide Open ###""--Well, you get the idea."
5,one of my favorite books,"basically its a sci fi book with some decent humor..""why are we born only to suffer""? great story of a mans journey to answer a very big question a lot of us may have asked ourselves at one time or another..if you look for it , it has some great messages just under the surface of its science fiction plot. highly reccomend especially if you enjoy Kurt Vonnegutenjoy"
5,"Great read, fun and short!","I loved this book. Even though I havent read it since high school I still think about it. But, where have all the soft back copies gone to? I'm also a huge fan of Vonnegut, and until recently I thought he had written the book. However, Vonnegut's satire and humor is usually a little bit more subtle and dark."
5,A satire approch to the meaning of life,Simon is a great charactor to use on a high-flying imaginitivly funny prediction of how the universe was created.
5,"Great book, but don't buy this printing","This is a classic sci-fi farce, bringing to life a fictional book originally described in Vonnegut's ""God Bless You Mr. Rosewater"", while making fun of sci-fi, Vonnegut's early writing style, and generally delivering on the premise that Vonnegut creates for Kilgore Trout.The trouble with this hardcover binding is: 1) It's hardcover, which isn't how Vonnegut described the book to begin with, and 2) It lacks essential cover features described by Vonnegut, such as the ridiculous photo of Trout that appears on the back cover of the paperback.So don't buy this in hardcover; seek out a used copy of the paperback edition."
3,Hilariously Awful,"This is Kilgore Trout's best known novel. Trout is a fictional bad science fiction writer appearing in Kurt Vonnegut's writing. This fictional fiction is altogether too silly to be taken seriously; but, if you can stomach the deliberate awfulness of it, it is awfully hilarious. If you like Douglas Adams then you will get a kick out of it. Be warned that this gratuitous joke of a book contains gratuitous sex."
4,As concrete as nihlism can get,"I am of the mind that Mr. Trout is indeed the only surviver of some long ago tragedy that had wiped the earth of the human scourge and that we, you and I, are mere inklings, mere suggestions of ideas still left in Mr. Trouts head. I, for one, feel privlidged that I am being devinely guided by Mr. Trout and I hope that, in his infinite wisdom, he lets me get rich soon. A 10 would be presumptous (Trout talking) but an 8 seems about right"
1,Daft if not mad,"When I was studying the history and philosophy of science way back in the 1980s, I was an assiduous reader of Steve Fuller. His books and articles were truly insightful.I have no idea what to make of this work. The original, by C. Wright Mills in 1959, was a model of clarity, and a brilliant introduction to a contentious social science, which some have described as ""producing unpopular explanations for the bleeding obvious"". Dr Fuller's work is some sort of rant which I am obviously too dim to appreciate, especially the extended chapters about Nazis.C. Wright Mills work was an exemplary attempt to introduce sociology to the uninitiated. I have no idea what Dr Fuller's version is about, and the only reason you would introduce it to a student thinking of studying sociology is to make sure they never do so."
4,The Last Posse,"A good old fashioned western even in Black & White there was plenty of action even though there was flash-backsfrom the beginning to the end it was well worth watching Broderick Crawford played a good part in this movie as well all the other actors if you are a keen western fan this is well worth buying to watch i'm sure you won,t be disapointed."
5,Works up a good sweat on an intermediate/advanced level,"This video was great! I like to work up a sweat when I do my workouts and this one did it. There is alternating of lots of jumping moves in this video with lower body toning(squats, lunges, etc.). There is not much of an upper body workout if you are considering to do a workout with some upper body toning. At the end there is like a 5-10 minute section where you do some punches like Tae-Bo and some calisthenics for the upper body. Overall this tape gave me a good aerobic workout."
5,First Class,"This is a terrific overview of infrastructure, very clear and accessible to anyone who is willing to read a bit carefully. I plan to use it as a text in an undergraduate course for social science undergraduates next academic year."
5,Infrastructure: A Field Guide to the Industrial Landscape,"We have all enjoyed this book immensely. I have a waiting list of friends who want to read it.Everything you ever wondered about, about the construction and workings of the industries and infrastructure that supports Western civilisations, written in the most approachable, down-to-earth and, at times, humorous manner. Mr Hayes has obviously enjoyed this project himself and shares that enjoyment and sense of wonder with the reader.A treasure."
4,Critical Lifelines,"I have looked for along time for a book like this. No where is more information packed into one book about our ""critical lifelines"". This is a coffee table book that explores the full spectrum of every lifeline/infrastructure society needs to exist. The only recommended improvement areas would be to add more in a another volume. I could not put this book down! For disaster managers or community planners, this book is for you. The price is misleading, so much information for so little cost."
5,CAN'T STOP DANCING,This is one of my favourite disco/dance album ever have. The remixes of 'Follow Me' and 'Queen Of Chinatown' are the best. Thumb up! Truly want to buy the two big hits' maxi single.
3,"A glimpse into the soul of a man, who like us all battles with piety and thankfully loses more often than not...","I adore WH Auden's gifted poetry and in this book we have a glimpse at his conflicted tussle with Christianity. It is such a human book, written about an intensely human, yet magnificent poet that it is well worth buying for those not convinced by over pious texts and those who relate to the contradictions, conflict and peace found within Christianity and belief."
4,"Captures a wild, crazy time quite vividly","It must've been a crazy, hectic time for the all-girl hard rock band: 16 and 17-year olds, traveling around the world, trying to get famous. This album(prev. unreleased gems, live tracks, studio hijinks)really captures The Runaways' world perfectly, with laughter and madness and mayhem mixed with great music. Probably the biggest find was Cherie Currie's pseudo-lament ""Hollywood Dream""(actually a better song than ""Midnight Music"" from 'Queens of Noise')and of course the fabulous ""Hollywood Cruisin'"" with Lita Ford & Jackie Fox 'doing the Boulevard'. Sounds like they were having a blast--too bad it didn't last."
4,Runaways - 'Flaming School Girls' (Cherry Red),"Nicely assembled Runaways compilation,that was originally released in 1980.Good old school 'girl's night out' style hard rock.About every cut here rocks out,like ""Hollywood Cruisin'"",""Secrets"",a couple of Joan Jett penned compositions ""C'mon"" and ""I Love Playing With Fire"" as well as their two covers,George Harrison's ""Here Comes The Sun"" and the Beatle's ""Strawberry Fields""(well done).A definite should-have."
3,ok,"The Runaways are my ""closet"" band. I found them from listening to Joan Jett. Are they great no, but for thier time they were ground breakers and they must be recognized for it. Cherie Currie does some nice solo piano work the Strawberry Fields and here comes the sun.If your a Runaways fan, just take the plunge and dive in no regrets.If your new to the band Go Live in Japan first."
5,Going 'On with the show' is what they always did.,"I loved their version of Chicago, I also loved Cassandra, a childhood favourite, as well as Jungle Jiver, Jubilee Morning as well as Au revoir. I am thrilled this is on CD."
3,Overly Academic But Still Interesting,"As a polio survivor, I was interested in reading this book which pulls together accounts from over 100 other polio survivors. While it was interesting to reading these accounts, I found the book to be over ""academic"", which hurt its readability quite a bit. It was thoroughly footnoted and scholarly, but was quite a slog to get through. There were also a number of places where the same points seemed to be made over and over again, sometimes separated by several pages; closer editing would have helped. Still, it is an important pull-together of narratives from these survivors, and the author's efforts are to be applauded."
1,Living With Polio,"As aa Polio survivor who has read other documents and a book by Dr. Lauro Halstead on the same subject, I found this book very poorly written, and very very repetitive."
5,Great battery,Received in great condishtion and I would buy another one when I need one.I would tell all of my friends about it.
2,THE DIRTY SOUTH,"I was reading some of the reviews on here and one person said this book was as good as ""THE COLDEST WINTER EVER"" that is a lie.... This book had its share of errors and misprints.. This book did nothing for me, but I finished it. It was ok but where was the story line, it had so many different people, Im still trying to figure out where some of the charaters came from. And Rae-Kwon and Donita had 4 kids together, later in the book it states they only had 3... Like I said I got through this book, but what was the purpose of writing a book with no story line, just talk... Thats my opinion.."
4,Have gorilla glue on hand,"It is what it is. The glue it comes with is weak, so you'd better use something that bonds better. Also plan on being frustrated for a while trying to get the pegs into the holes. Works good, and looks okay though (just like the picture)."
2,not worth it,it was even cheaper than it looked. we ended up buying something else. this one is going to the donation bin.
1,Blah,"WARNING: May contain spoilers.This book was rather boring and I'm surprised I even read the whole thing. Towards the end things just wrap up a little too neatly.The number of villians is this book was ridiculous, it seemed like everyone was out to get Carolina. And their reasons for it were just lame. Too many characters (mostly the villians) didn't seem to have brains. Leland, Mercedes, Payton, and Antonio all acted so surprised when they were found out.I've never read anything by this writer before, and I doubt I will in the future."
3,"Like, when?","The book was okay. I read it with excitement. But ultimately, I was disappointed. The best never came. It is like the author got tired around page 225 and decided to end it as quickly as possible. Carolina, the main character, must have had her head in a flower basket not too see all the things going on around her. Things get really bad. Then, all of a sudden, things are explained and tied up quickly with a big ribbon like a fairy tale. If you want only the happiest of endings read this book.P.S. I did learn a lot about flowers and decorating and haute whatever."
2,Messy!,"This dry shampoo may help with doggy odor, but it is so messy that I only used it once. The dry powder gets everywhere and continues to get on everything after lots and lots of brushing. It only helps with the doggy smell for a short time, too. For me, it wasn't worth the mess."
3,Easy indeed,"My own fault for not noticing the 'Easy Piano' portion, but it is indeed the watered down version of the song, so be careful! I'll be handing this off to a friend someday... and purchasing the full version in a few minutes as replacement."
1,dissapointing,"This disc is shortened versions of the songs. Double Dutch Bus is only 1:40 minutes, I Wanna Dance is :49 minutes, and so on. If you want whole songs find another disc."
3,Black Panther,The Black Panther is my favorite Marvel Supper Hero. Too bad there's no Storm like the motion comic... and the juggernaut looks funny.
1,Never Came,Ordered the product and about a week later (around when I was expecting delivery) was told it didn't exist. Got a refund.
3,weird,I don't remember this purchase and I've looked and can't find this book. I can't rate this transaction and I'm concerned I didn't actually make this purchase
3,Wax-works for me,"I like the first Waxwork movie on this two movie set. I admit I am a horror fan, but am somewhat picky about the movies I watch. This one is cute and silly. The stories are ok if you enjoy some light horror. There's a bit of gore in this one, so be prepared. I haven't viewed the second one, Lost in Time as of yet. I will edit my review once I do."
5,Ah Ohhhh...That's gotta hurt...,"As if the original Waxwork wasn't enough to make this an excellent DVD, the makers decided to throw in the sequel, which is just as good as the first movie. This is a must have DVD for horror fans. The special effects and plot are wonderful. There's something for everyone in this flick. I was absolutely obsessed with these movies as a kid and I still love it today!"
1,Ugh!,"Let me start by saying I have never given anything a bad review on here but this movie....sooooo disappointed me.....I remember seeing it when I was younger and loving it but I lost 4 hours of my life on this....yes I watched both hoping for something....but nothing came of it....it had a good idea but went nowhere with it.....and the acting...in a word, Cheezy on all accounts....sorry, I hate being negative but I got nothing else on this one."
1,Not Good,"I'm a big fan of Horror Movies from the 80s. However, this one just didn't work out too well. Even though I knew it was going to be a goofy one, I guess I was expecting something better than what I watched. Don't fall for all the big reviews as I did. Now the second installment was worse than the first. The price was good for a double feature, and the product (movie) had great reviews. Why not buy it right? Save your money, and save your time. Don't waste it on this."
1,Not Fit,I have seen horror movies but this one was not fit to look at I know some people gave it 5 stars why ? I don't know .This movie REALLY SUCKS and the following one Waxwork 2 my goodness EEECH ! I might be picky but grandma certainly wouldn't approve of these two DUMB MOVIES .
5,what's not to love about it?,"It's really impossible to be bored by these movies if you're a fan of horror comedies and the 80's. They're just perfect fun, you can watch them again and again, and best of all, you get both movies for the price of one. I wish the DVD hadn't put on the fullscreen version, but that doesn't matter so much, not with cheesy fun horror movies like this. Pure cheesy fun."
5,Camp and not so good camp,Waxwork is a great campy 80's horror flick. It is ridiculous without being cliched. The plot is a good horror plot and it is very good all around for anyone who likes good camp films. The sequel is only okay in comparison to the first. They went too far on the fight scenes and didn't focus enough on the plot or making it campy!
2,New Bach,this was not at all what I expected. that is probably my own fault. Not the sellers. teach me to research more
2,Rather dull,"I have a number of excellent books on Flower Remedies and bought this because I thought that it would add a new angle. In fact, it was rather dull and obvious in its approach and did not have a new, or intelligent, or intuitive addition to the already overcrowded market on Bach remedies. There are more than 650 other remedies out there, Bach is only a small sample. To write yet another book on the subject you need to have a very special feel for them, and the author doesn't. He's no medical intuitive. I sent the book back."
5,Shostakovich's Brilliant Masterwork Well Served,"There are so many breathtaking moments in each of the three movements of this symphony that attaching word descriptions to them seems futile. Just brace yourself for some of the most imaginative scoring, combinations of instruments, sparing of dance forms with the vitriol of underlying fear and sadness, and an ending that has all the tender resignation and pathos of the composer's String Quartet #15: after using every instrument created Shostakovich allows the symphony to fade into nothingness with a soft celeste solo agains pitzing harps and tam tam effects in the strings. This is a magnificent work - one well worth the multiple listenings that are required to get into it. Valery Gergiev manages to get it all and while there are many choices of recordings for this masterful work, this one is about as perfect as they come. Grady Harp, January 10"
5,FOURIER SERIES,"EXCELLENT BOOK WRITTEN BY A WELL KNOWN RUSSIAN MATH TEACHER. IT IS SLIGHTLY ABOVE MY ENTRY LEVEL MATH BUT CAN BE INCORPORATED AFTER SOME TRIG, ALGEBRA AND CALCULUS REVIEW"
2,What gives?,"Why is it all of these Fourier books start-off deep in the math? This book expects you to know everything about Fourier series before you even pick it up. Just once, I'd like a math text book that doesn't try to show how smart the author thinks he is."
4,Bulldog roots,"If you are looking for a book on the history of mack's this one is for you. If you like pictures of old trucks (and really old ones, 1920's-30's) you will like this. The book only covers the beginning to the 60's. Some of the pictures are really nice. If you are a semi truck fan, this book will still be likable. Of course, this book only showcases mack trucks, and sometimes, the photos become repeditive, because the author shows a lot of shots of one particular model."
3,the way it ran in the '20's?,The train stopped running in 1914 and didn't run again until the 30's... what is with this?
3,Not iPhone 5 compatible.,"I purchased this almost solely as an iPhone charger on my desk to avoid having to plug in to computers. My wife has an iPhone 4/s and I have an iPhone 5. The older 4/s charges just fine with this hub, but the 5 wont charge at all. I have the A/C adapter plugged in and everything is connected properly, its just the apparently the iPhone 5 requires more power then the hub provides. Aside from that it seems to be a great hub. Installed just fine, looks very nice and discreet.I had questions before buying this and couldn't seem to find answers, so I am providing them below:- This comes with an A/C adapter to make it a ""Powered"" USB hub. However the adapter does not fully fit in the device. There is a 1/4 inch of the male end still sticking out when plugged in.- As a powered USB hub it will charge an iPhone 4/s or older.- The light on mine is red not green like the photo."
1,Worst Product!!!,"This is the best concept ever. Keeps my USB cables much more organized. Too bad it's a horrible product. I have owned 4 of these now, and EVERY one of them has failed within 6 months."
2,"Nice looking, but didn't charge","The grommet itself was nice looking and a matte black so looked professional, etc. However, went to plug in my iPhone using the USB port(s) and the phone wasn't charging. Grabbed my husbands cord and same thing. Perhaps the one I got was defective, but I'm reluctant to order another fearing the same outcome."
4,USB expansion -- Neat addition to a desk setup,"Neat addition to a desk setup. Requires external power. Beware if you are planning to drill a hole to insert this in -- it's pretty touchy. The hole-drilling-bit I used wasn't _quite_ the right size and I spent some time and tense moments customizing the hole. It installs by placing a circular sleeve in the hole in the desk, then placing the USB-hub-section in and rotating it 90 degrees. The hole in the desk needs to be pretty much perfectly round (easy with a factory-drilled hole, hard to do with a hand-drill and dull bit) or the sleeve will distort and the hub will bind up.Don't underestimate this, though -- everything worked well once the hole in the table was correctly dimensioned. Neat device, works as advertised. Comes with software drivers, I think, though I don't recall actually needing it for my computer."
4,Informative,"This DVD was very interesting and informative for non-Jewish viewers like me. For many years I have been interested in the Jewish religion and way of life and this was a good way to get my feet wet. I've watched it several times now, which has sparked my curiosity to find out more. As I've stated, this is a good start - but there is much more that could have been done to make this type of presentation an excellent presentation."
5,The Organizer has orgainized his book in a superb manner !,"I would definitely recommend you to read this book if your into gang stories. This book is one of the thrilling books I have ever read. It's filled with murder, suspense, mystery and passion. It grasp the reader's attention . It was so intriguing that I finished the book in a days time. It went beyond my expectation. This is by far the most sensational book I have ever read. As there is an old saying ""Never judge a book by it's cover."" Well.. there you have it. Presenting you ""THE ORGANIZER."""
4,"Fast moving, action packed mystery!",This book will keep your attention with it's ups and downs -- then you'll find yourself running right alongside the characters. It's a storyline that is easily related to and I look forward to the continuation...
4,Wheelers -Stewart,"As the co-author, I am delighted with this book. Stewart's writing is (mostly...) beautiful, and we got our philosophies over pretty well..."
1,"Read Vinge, Egan, anything but this book","Simply put, this book is terrible. It's advertised as ""hard sci fi"" but the ideas, not even to mention the story or characters, just aren't there. The characters are all paper cutouts and the storyline drags very badly. I kept checking the page number and thinking, ""Is it possible I've read this many pages and still feel like the interesting part hasn't started yet?"" Worst of all, the ""hard sci fi"" consists of a Jovian gas-based society (which has been done much better by other authors) and nanotech machines, the Wheelers, which they simply *skip* actually describing in detail in the book! By the end I felt scammed by the marketing of this book. If you are looking for hard sci fi, do yourself a favor and buy anything by Vernor Vinge, Ian Banks, Greg Egan, or any of the many other authors writing much better works in this genre."
3,Deceptive=Buyer Beware!,"If you are a fan of the ORIGINAL Fleetwood Mac, this CD might be just what you are looking for. I bought this knowing that the songsmp were from that era so I wasn't disappointed. The cover implies that Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks perform on this CD. That's not the case. If you buy this, you will be getting the early works of the band that predates the Rumours era lineup and even Bob Welch."
3,English Sunshine,"If you're an Agatha Christie fan, this is probably one for the library. If you appreciate Joan Hickson's translation of the spinster sleuth's character, it's a must, despite the poor quality of the video, which has not survived well the move to DVD for US TV screens from the UK's more advanced system when the film was shot. Features are fuzzy, as if through a Vaselined lens . . . But the fun of Joan Dickson's performance is worth the frustrations, and as Jane Marple fuddy-duddides along in her relentless quest after yet another murderer - picking up her moniker of ""Nemesis,"" means this little gem is worth having in you library. When the rain patters on the windows and the chill knocks on your door, you could do much worse than light the fire, curl up with a spot of tea and a couple of crumpets with clotted cream and raspberry preserves and enjoy!"
5,one of the best remakes,"really enjoyed this dvd one of the better Agatha Christie movies cast was fabulous and Helen Hays as the not quite there slightly dithery Miss Maples is excellent, A really good murder mystery"
5,VHS tape,I DID NOT HAVE THIS MISS MARPLE MOVIE AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT- IN BOOD CONDITION. i LOVE TO FIND AGATHA CHRISTIE B OOKS AND MOVIES THAT I DO NOT HAVE YET.
5,Mooran more - last of a trilogy,"Mr. Maclean's excellent review gives you the historical perspective and Amazon's description gives you the story details of Munif's final book in his Cities of Salt trilogy.While I didn't enjoy this quite as much as the first two, it was still an enthralling read - if for no other reason than Munif's ability to write and Theroux's ability to translate.The trilogy provides an in depth story of a way of life that we can hardly fathom. The time span covered is not that long ago, but impossible to recapture except for dry textbooks or (much better) books by someone like Munif. I'm not sure there is another Munif, and if there is I'm don't know how a better job could be done.Read this for enjoyment. But make sure your mind is fully engaged so you can achieve some understanding of a place and time which is the basis for so much of our current world."
4,Hoya UV Filter,"This is one of a number of Hoya UV filters that I use. The use of UV filters was recommended by an experienced photographer, and though I have not used this particular camera without filters on the lenses, I am entirely satisfied with the result. The filter also offers the lens a degree of protection from damage.Raymonte."
2,So hard to clean using best lens cleaners,"As couple of other reviewers have noted earlier, it is so hard to clean the filter even using best lens cleaners and microfiber clothes.Otherwise it seems to be good at reducing flares and cutting down uv haze."
2,Not Worth the Trouble,"The Hoya DMC Professional UV filter is built fairly well and the lens glass quality as well as coatings both serve a purpose specific to detail work but with a single caveat that causes this filter to lose value immediately. The thin lens is not only easy to break but, as the previous reviewer noted, it is so difficult to clean that the only place it seems useful is in a clean room with the requisite white suit.If you can't manage to frame a shot to compensate for vignetting and absolutely must purchase this filter, I feel no pity at all for the misery which will inevitably follow. Both HMC and Tiffen try their hardest to market ultra-thin coated UV (as well as a polarizer) filters to the people who want to buy any and all accessories for their shiny new camera's. Don't fall for the bait."
4,Great Lense,"While I might say a polarizing filter is more valuable, this filter gives the sharpest image without distortion and does an incredible job keeping the lense clean and undamaged. Fits nicely on my Canon T2i and I would reccomend the Hoya brand to anyone who is looking for a filter like this one."
2,impossible to clean,"I can't say anything bad about image quality.I bought this filter to protect a very expensive lens, minimizing the loss in image quality due to flare. Well, I think I made a mistake, since this lens is VERY hard to clean, and so, you have to be extremely careful not to touch it or get it stained, because you'll have to go through a lot to clean it.You CAN'T use lens cleaner liquids, the filter will be left worse off because of it. I ended up using a not recomended liquid just to remove the stain left by the recomended cleaner, and I think It might have damaged the coatings.I think a protective filter is meant to be cleaned constantly. This filter seriously diminishes your possibilities, since you have to handle it with more care than the lense itself."
1,Coating delaminating from glass,"I purchased a 52mm Hoya Pro Digital filter and a 58mm Pro Digital filter about 8 months ago. These have seen little use, have not been exposed to the elements and have only been cleaned using professional lens cleaners and micro-fiber cloths.I was inspecting and cleaning filters today and both of the Hoya Pro filters have the coatings delaminating from the glass. I saw absolutely no problems with my B&W; or the Marumi filters. They have all been exposed to the same environments and cleaning techniques. I have used Hoya filters for many years but never again."
2,Sex and drugs should be more interesting than this...,"There is no Parental Advisory label on this CD, although you can just tell from the track listing that there should be.The lyrics are included in the booklet, and they read like a bad porno novel. If you're into pedophilia, golden showers and enemas, then this CD is for you! If not, then you might want to give this one a miss.Even if I could overlook the dreadful lyrics, the music and singing are bland and uninspired. Sex and drugs should be way more interesting than Chevy Heston makes them sound.I give it two stars instead of one because I've listened to rap, so I've actually heard worse... but not by much."
5,Wonderful interpretations of straight-ahead & Brazilian jazz,"In a world of cliches, jazz vocalist Maija (pronounced ""Maya"") gives us a refreshing and always-surprising mix of straight-ahead and Brazilian tunes, alternately upbeat and lyrical. Her talented voice has the backing of tight arrangements and able musicians including appearances by guitarist Charlie Byrd and trumpeter Claudio Roditi. As in her first CD (Before We Lose Tomorrow), Maija brings a unique originality to her interpretations. Notable tracks include the haunting ""Sea of Stars,"" her fast-paced ""A Sleepin' Bee,"" and her own composition ""In Another Lifetime."" From Reuben Jackson's liner notes: ""A wondrous mix of sublime yearning and bracing originality ... bursting with lyricism and sensuality."" A must for serious lovers of jazz."
4,"As it says, literature and the Gaeltacht community","Gearóid Denvir is known as the face of Irish Studies abroad; besides he has almost an insider perspective into Gaeltacht life, as he belongs to the generation of non-native speakers who moved into the Gaeltacht in order to work for the community. His collected essays reflect this very appropriately; however, I am too irritated by his rather unfair (although understandable) depiction of Séamus Ó Grianna to give him the fifth star. Gearóid's proficiency in Irish equals to that of a native speaker, and linguistically speaking he is probably the best essayist ever in the language. His views on the Irish-language community in Connemara are especially interesting and important."
3,The Forever Man - Not Eternally Fun,"This game is just okay. Not a game you should expect to keep playing for a while. While some of the moves ARE rather cool-looking yet simple, the gameplay doesn't offer much variance from level to level. Also, some of the end-of-game challenges are not merely difficult, but nearly impossible. Thus, while this game is fun occasionally, its value is little more than as a novelty when you get it, and the thrill won't last long."
3,The original size please,"Why try to do something different when the original size was the best frog lure out there. I finally find the Wee Frog by Rebel everything about this frog is the same , except the most important thing , Its size. The frog is now twice the size it used to be . But it still looks the same , swims the same ,Wiggles the same but it's not the same , It's just too big No Bass wants to go up against something that looks like it could kick it's own ASS. If anyone knows where i can find the Wee Frog that is the original size , I would love to know. Thanks Cooper"
2,Let's be honest,"I'll get right to the point. The orchestra is so atrocious as to make this DVD almost unlistenable. If you want to see a performance of the Schumann sonata, perhaps this is for you. But be warned. If you can get through the Triple Concerto without cringing, you are a better man than I. The Prokofiev? A student work by a second-rate composer, performed by a third-rate orchestra. Gee, does it get any better than that? Even the redoubtable Argerich can't rescue this disaster."
2,Badly Dated: a voice out of 1999,"This might have been a good book in 1999, when the author wrote it. Despite its 2002 copyright date, the original printing was 2000, and most of it was written in the 1990s and not updated. So, if you want a detailed look at what guns were available almost 10 years ago, this is it. If you want up-to-date information on CC handguns, this is a waste of money. The other is highly opinionated, and won't even discuss smaller caliber guns, so it's 9mm Luger and up only, folks. Also, many of the models he discusses in detail are no longer made (or are made by other manufacturers now) and many of the very best, most advanced and up-to-date guns aren't covered here because they didn't exist. Overall, this is a historical piece only. It is badly in need of a new edition, and not a quick makeover, but a ground-up rewrite. $16.50 for what you get is too much. There are far better, more up-to-date books out there on the subject."
3,Not so great,"Quite disappointing. I guess someone who knows nothing at all about firearms would get something out of it but for anyone with the least bit of experience in using guns this is not worth the effort. I thought some of the information was off target (pun intended). Photos did not match captions in some instances. The same old dogma about .45 caliber being the best choice. And, yes, the photo on the cover is Wiley Clapp's favorite snubnose revolver--despite the vast number of other reviewers who report you risk nerve damage in your hand by shooting magnum loads in such a lightweight handgun.Oh, well...."
3,Decent overview of conceal carry pistols,"The author attempts to cover too many pistols in too little pages. He provides a generalized over view of a great number of pistols -- concentrating primarily on larger caliber handguns (9 mm Para and up). He raises issues regarding conceal carry which provides the reader things to think about. However, he doesn't really provide enough comparison between the various pistols nor a detailed enough explanation to aid the reader in making an acutal selection. He does provide a useful top picks list, but without little to no explanation on how those picks are better than the other guns described."
3,One experts guide to concealed carry handguns,"The author left out all the handguns he thought were underpowered so the book was much shorter than it could have been. The book is a good overview of different types, makes, and sizes of handguns, but It is hard to compare them to each other."
4,Excellent...but..,"Our Son has become concerned with both local/State/Federal Govt. review and involvement in gun ownership....we thought this could help us understand ""how to do it right""."
4,CWC,"Great service...got book as a gift, some info seems ""dated"", read in earlier material (in another article); basic info for the novice."
4,Decent flag... but,"My only beef with this flag is that, unlike the picture depicts, the star is angled. Oh well, for the price it's alright I guess."
2,"Stainless Steel Cup, Chrome Plated structure.",Quality not as stated. The Cup is Stainless but the structure looks Chrome Plated.The juicer is too light to stand still while pressing and it tilts over.
4,looks nice.,"The car looks very nice, it is a very good replica. The wheels feel some loose and weak, so the car isn't recomended for some play."
1,Made of cheap corrugated colored cardboard that I could of done myself!,"I would give this negative stars if I could. I could of made this myself for less money. Once I saw how cheaply this gift box was constructed I quickly put it back in the box and returned it for a full refund. It is not at all how it is described or pictured. It is constructed of colored corrugated cardboard. There are dents, holes and glue marks everywhere. I am still in shock how much this cost me! It resembled something my child would of made for me in kindergarten as a project for Mother's Day. I have posted some REAL pictures under the product page so you can see for yourself."
1,Terrible quality not worth the price,"for over $15 I was expecting at least a nice looking gift box. Instead I got a ""gift"" box with glue all over the place and with poorly finished edges. It honestly looks as if it would have been made by a 5 year old."
1,Yuck,"I purchase boxes for handmade jewelry, but had to toss these, would be a loss to return. They looked like dime store finds and made my jewlery look cheap."
2,Condition of Product,"The item itself was what I expected, but the box had sticky stuff on the back and a stain on the pink front.A little disappointing since I purchased it as a gift box."
2,WRONG AUTHOR,"This book is not by John Forster but rather by B. W. Matz, a reprinting of his 1901 CHARLES DICKENS: SOME NOTES ON HIS LIFE AND WRITINGS"
3,"Cute, but . . .","I'm not sure if it was just the one I ordered or if it was all the suits, but I washed it and the sequins that are inside the tulle ruffle around the waist came out of a rather large hole. I'm not a great seamstress, but I did manage to sew it well enough that my daughter could wear it. But, what were they thinking when they put tulle on a swimsuit? Better yet, what was I thinking?"
3,Learn from the great minds of Wall Street,"This book contains personal interviews with the past and present great minds of Wall Street. The interview questions however are very similar for each person, and therefore make this book quite boring after a while. If you are into investing and Wall Street, it's not a bad read."
2,"Average book, significant omissions","Why was there not an interview with Warren Buffet? Some of the 'gurus' performance has lagged the S&P500's, e.g Gabelli. Better books exist -- read the books by Peter Lynch, for. eg. or Buffetology by Mary Buffet"
4,Nice idea; Great Job!,"Entertaining for a money book. Brisk interviews with people who gamble with billions of other people's money. Interesting debate on the Efficient Market Theory, or passive vs active investing. Author has excellent interviewing and research skills, nice minimal cross-referencing."
