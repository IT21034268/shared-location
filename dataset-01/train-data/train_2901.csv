3,More Theoretical Than Instructional,"I've read some of the other reviews on this product, and I agree that it's hard to find core rules of inking when sorting through Klaus Jansen's ""preachy"" style of writing. It also doesn't expand a great deal on anything that wasn't laid down already in ""How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way"" by Stan Lee. However, I would say that Klaus' experience shows through his writing. The images that he provides in the book, along with the blurbs he writes with them, are far more instructional that the main parts of the text. The main parts come off as a stream-of-consiousness that switches between the subject of inking comics and working in the industry as a whole.Long story short, it covers the basic tenets of inking, but also gives a lesson spread throughout about working in comics as a whole. I did learn some things to try in my own artwork, but nothing that changed it a great deal. Still a good reference for an aspiring comics artist like myself."
5,More Sturdy Minicons,"Many buyers are weary of buying minicons (understandably so)because they have small parts and pop apart very easily. This set is one of those that are constructed well. The Sea team is a set of original designs all the same color. I like the fact that Hasbro finally had a minicon team made of water vehicles. Each has missile that can be launched with pressure from your thumb. Waterlog and Stormcloud look good both as vehicles and robots. Waterlog's my favorite. Oceanglide, though is good in vehicle mode, but is a little goofy as a robot. These figures are fairly easy to transform, and I have never had a part pop off of them. They stand up fairly well. (Sometimes you have to position their arms carefully for balance.) I recommend this set to any transformer fan. It is safer than most others."
5,It's BIG,THIS IS A FUN PUZZLE IT IS BIG AND THE DRAWINGS ARE QUITE NICE. MY 3YEAR OLD SON IS LEARNING THE ALPHABET AND THIS HELPS
4,BINGO! It is a hit!,My son received this toy for his second birthday. He loves to match the round pieces to the corresponding fence by color AND animal. He loves to fill the barn and empty it. I love that all of the pieces are housed together in a small amount of space. The game rules are simple and fun.
5,Wonderful first game,"This is a great first game. It is very short in duration and teaches the basics of game playing (taking your turn, wining, following rules) without being overly involved or lengthy. The bingo chip dispenser is great fun for toddlers and makes the game very enticing. I highly recommend this game! However, I think that this game is probably more appropriate for 2-4 year olds than 3-6 year olds. I've played this with several 2 years olds and they've gotten the game immediately. This was some of the best 9 dollars that I've spent and will be giving this as a gift many times."
4,Good game for beginners,"If your kids are starting to want to play games, this is a good one to start with. It teaches colors, animals, and matching. It is a fast-paced game so smaller kids will not get bored. You can either play BINGO with the animals or just colors or you can play another version. The best thing is that this game comes with its own plastic case so everything is put back and there are no loose pieces all over the house. Cute game for smaller kids."
1,Product does not match title and description,"Item title is clearly ""Rogar 4"" Grid Hooks for Professional Collection Pot Racks 9860-6, Finish: Brass Plated, Quantity: 24 Hooks "".Well they are brass finished... and they are 4"" hooks, but that says 24 hooks, TWENTY FOUR! I received one package of 4 hooks.There is nothing in the product description to indicate you will only be receiving one card. Buyers beware, the title is inaccurate at best. Mine are one the way back. Go to Lowes and get a bag of 6 for less than $5."
3,A fast and somewhat cliched read...,"Marin's book was something I read less than day. It was easy and, at times, quite amusing. He is something of lovable Cad. His New York is one most of us never get to experience and is somewhat exciting. Still, after while, you start to wonder when love will find him again. The stories aren't as outrageous as I hoped (perhaps I've watched too many sitcoms), although there are a few laughs. The end, which was real life for him, seems cliched and forced (even if true). And a bit sad. Still, I hope for the best for the ""cad"" and his ""Cadette"" as he calls her in the opening."
3,Some wisdom from a wanna be CAD,"I read this book, but like the other reviewers, there was a lot that did not ring true. I believe that most CADS are not really this cerebral. If you aren't their target, I love the way they sort of ""look past"" you at parties. I am always reminded of Warhol's quote from his diary ""looking at you like a gay guy looking for something better.""Marin's jacket photo does not qualify him as a classic CAD--who is handsome/boyishly cute. I remember a girlfriend who joked about her boyfriend who had a large nose--""Do you think I'm going to pass that down to my kids?""Nonetheless, since the real CADs can't be bothered to expose themselves or their fraternity, Marin's book offers insight into the mind of a pseudo-CAD."
2,Not what the hype whould have you believe,"If what you had in mind when this book piqued your curiosity was a sparkling, witty, acerbic read on the New York singles scene from the guy's point of view - don't bother. I ordered it thinking there would be some fun and pithy tongue-and-cheek moments written by a self-described 'cad' and found instead a dated, boring, thin, badly written quickie - although certainly a well-hyped quickie carefully crafted to sell. The 'cad' it turns out is a balding guy who looks like a squirrel - next time leave your photo off the book jacket and allow a flattering mental image to form in the imaginations of your readers. The author says he was a television critic during the long-ago-dating-mating-days he describes. That, at least, was believable. Save your time and money for something worth the effort if you're hoping for a good read."
1,Skip it,"Cad is the equivalent of a nightmare first date. Sure, you think, he's not cute or particularly intelligent, but maybe he'll be fun and, let's be honest, any date is better than staying at home watching reruns of Sex and the City.Unfortunately, it turns out he's even uglier than you remembered and not funny at all. On the contrary: he's crude, boring, goes on and on about himself, and it's obvious he considers himself the catch of the century, which leads you to conclude he needs a shrink--and a new pair of glasses.Most of us have had at least one of those dates, the kind that make us cringe and wish we were home doing laundry, or at the dentist having a root canal--anywhere but here, listening to this horrible guy. Well, Rick Marin is that man and Cad is that date. Run."
1,Mildly entertaining...,"Mildly entertaining is being nice.He has really done nothing more than any other guy that has faced the dilemma of having to date again after the break-up of a long serious relationship, or in his case marriage.The truth here is he tries to make his life sound more entertaining than it is; his circumstances make his life interesting not him (He is in NYC). After all, put him in Idaho and have him tell this story and nobody cares - he wouldn't even get the book published.If that doesn't persuade you not to buy it, check out the companion website and you'll see how truly average this guy really is."
1,One Question...,Rick Marin thinks he has what it takes to be a cad. I only have one question: does he own a mirror?
3,Lighthearted and fun,"There's nothing profound or meaningful about this book, but it sure is a good read. All guys will surely nod their heads in sympathy as they read each episode in this guy's landmine-filled love life. And I think most women would find it insightful, in a lighthearted sort of way. Rick Marin really does get right to the heart of what it means to be a single guy - not that we are all that complicated, mind you, so I'm not saying his achievement is worthy of any kind of prize, be it literary or sociological. But this book could have easily been written badly by a lesser author or lesser human being. Marin, I think, demonstrates quality in both categories."
1,"A Banal and Tedious Batchelor, Too","These can be interesting and fun articles in GQ, sometimes Details and less frequently in Esquire where editors try to freight every article with cultural meaning. This book falls into the Esquire category. And like many modern books it's a magazine article padded and padded and padded to get it between two hardcovers. Oh and it probably has an industrious agent along with the author pitching it for all sorts of cross-media opportunities. Subjects like these--bad men, bad women, etc are only worthy of a book if there is something particularly insightful, dreadful or writerly. This has none of those. This book is simply a long look back at lots of hangovers, lies and sadly extremely everyday crap behavior. Tiresome. Not worth the investment in the book or the time.[...]"
2,Mediocre,"The book is a boring description of a boring protagonist (who thinks too much of himself) dating a bunch of boring women. Not as witty and charming and insightful as I hoped. Reads just like an drab memoir of any single person I know. The book wasn't bad, at least it was a fast, if colourless, read."
4,A Great One Night Stand,"RICK MARIN's ""CAD"" is pointless and meandering...and that's why it is entertaining. You probably won't reread it when you're done but you'll have fun reading it the first time. The only thing really holding it back is that a) the hip attitude seems forced as if Marin does not believe himself to be as cool as he wishes us to believe, and b) he doesn't seem to have an underlying modesty to take his actions with a grain of salt. We're laughing at him, not with him. In Rikki Lee Travolta's ""MY FRACTURED LIFE"" he covered all the same areas of womanizing and being a ""cad"" but never took himself too seriously. His is a book I continue to reread, like a regular fling. ""CAD"" though was like a one night, good for the moment."
5,Funniest book since Lucky Jim,"And that blurb is from my former live-in gal pal, so Cad clearly has chicks-appeal. Zippy little book. Can't wait for the movie."
2,The mind of a shallow man,"I found this book depressing in an unenlightening way. Aren't ""cads"" supposed to be charming and, well, good looking (I saw him interviewed on TV)? I was expecting something fun and sexy but this book is about a judgemental creep with terrible values. That can be interesting. See Bret Easton Ellis or early Jay McInerney but I always got the feeling those guys knew what they were.Marin seems clueless. Could be redeemed by Hugh Grant starring in movie version. There's a cad who deserves the moniker."
1,Bait and switch,"This claims to be the Kaiser Noblesse springform pan at a wonderful price from the seller Shop and Save. In reality it is the Kaiser Classic line, which does NOT have the leak guard rim on the bottom *as seen in the product image*. The pan was properly labeled as the Classic line on the product insert by Kaiser.I will say the pan I received was of good quality and the price is most likely reasonable for that line. However it lacked the key feature I desired, which was the reason I ordered the Noblesse version instead of the Classic in the first place.The pan was promptly returned for refund.Lastly, if they are selling the Classic as the Noblesse line I do not want to think of what they are passing off as a Kaiser Classic pan."
4,great enhancement to notepad,"This is an incredible enhancement to the NotePad music application. I use NotePad to compose and play tunes on my Visor, but have been limited to the lame built-in sounds. This module not only improves the overall quality of the sound far beyond what is built into the Visor, but you can pick among 128 instrument sounds. The headphone jack allows me to use it on airplanes without bothering the people around me. Quality module well worth the money. One star off because BeatPlus support never responded to my e-mail."
1,Greek Myths With Roman Names,"This book is a disgrace to scholarship. The author muddles the entire subject by using the Roman names for the Greek deities. This is simply unacceptable in this day and age. It is disrespectful to the cultures of the ancient societies that produced these sacred stories. It is scandalous that a reputable publisher would have allowed such a travesty into print. As a university instructor of children's literature courses for thirty years, this is the absolute worst book on this topic I have ever read. Avoid it!"
1,Uses Roman names instead of Greek names...,"""The myths in this collection use their Roman names..."" -Quoted from page 71 of book.Um...why does this book use Roman names if it is supposed to be a collection of Greek Myths? Very confused.I think that ""D'aulaire's Book of Greek Myths"" is a better book of the same caliber."
2,There are Better Greek Myth Books Out There,"I love Mary Pope Osborne and all of her Magic Tree House books as well as ""One World Many Religions"", but I was not very impressed with ""Favorite Greek Myths"". For one thing, she uses the Roman names in all of the myths. What's up with that? Why would you title a book ""Favorite Greek Myths"" and then use the Roman names throughout?Osborne also crams every single minor deity into each story. So in ""The Kidnaping: The Story of Ceres and Proserpina"", she also works in Mercury. In ""Lost at Sea: The Story of Ceyx and Alcyone"", she also includes the god Sleep, his son Morpheus, and Iris. This gets really complicated and confusing. Other Greek myths we have read are a lot easier to follow.On the plus side, this book has beautiful illustrations by Troy Howell. They are in an Art Nouveau style, reminiscent of Alphonse Mucha."
2,Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach with CDROM,"The listing on Amazon specified ""with CDROM"" which implied that it was the 3rd edition. Instead a 2nd edition was delivered which included no CDROM. Moreover, all illustrations are black and white line drawings with a few B&W photos of people. The CD would have made all the difference."
4,Progressive Dynamics PD782WSBCV Double Ceiling Light,"I bought this light for my boat. It is bright and appears to be constructed well. I will lower my rating by one star because this light while being a double light, does not have the ability to use only one light at a time for a low or dual setting like my previous light had. Overall happy with this item."
4,Works well.,This unit works well and looks good but the switch works both lights at once unlike my old ones that do each seperately.
1,10 Amp bulbs in a RV?,"This overhead light was shown on a page with LED lights but there was two regular bulbs in the fixture. I sent it back as soon as I received it and checked it out.RV owners don't want to use regular bulbs anymore. Too big a drain on the batteries when ""dry camping""."
2,potential good cd rather disappointing,i purchased this cd expecting it to be a really good seclection however i was wrong. there were a few songs that i knew which made me think the cd would be good. the only downside to the cd is that the songs arent by the original artists they are remakes of the original songs. this cd would be so much better if it had all the original artists songs on it instead of someone else copying their hit. if you dont mind a lesser version of the original order this cd if you want the actual hits look elsewhere.
1,It sucks.,This previous reviewer was right. Save your money and buy the original songs. This sounds like reggaeton karaoke.
2,Hard work for poor reward,Fundamentally Clute is a sci-fan fan with an academic vocabulary. It sounds good until you examine what he's saying.Then you might just as well review fan-boy reviews for all theillumination he gives you.
2,Uh oh...,"I bought this VariZoom swivel to mount a H4N to the top of a Canon 7D, (it seems that many people have used this mount with success, and it is much cheaper than other options available), however once the shoe mount arrived the bottom screw would not turn to fasten to the 7D, so it freely slid in and out of the camera's hot shoe plate... AKA the bottom screw was locked up and wouldn't fasten. I've only sent two items back to Amazon and this was one of them. Perhaps I just got a dud though since many people have said on here that they have used them with success. (I needed more security so I purchased the Manfrotto brand shoe mount, also on Amazon.)"
2,Loose hot shoe connector,"I tried using the VariZoom to mount a SmallHD DP6 (5.6"") external monitor on a Canon 550D/T2i.The hot shoe connection would not tighten securely, so I couldn't trust it to hold my monitor in a production environment. I returned it and ordered theMarshall V-LCD-MT Monitor Adapter 1/4"" Mount Adapter To Video Camcorder Hot Shoe For LCD Monitors."
3,Good solidly built,"I purchased this from one of Amazon's vendors Adorama, the product was initially 'out of stock' after stating that it was in stock at the order point. I find it highly unlikely that someone ordered one of these at the same time!Regardless I did still receive the order within about 10 days, so it wasn't too bad."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I needed a FASCO motor but the one I needed is no longer made. I called FASCO and talked to an Engineer who assured me this particular motor was the ticket. I got 3 estimates and Amazon had the best cost, the fastest delivery and I received a brand spanking new motor. Working GREAT!"
1,Cheap Plastic Junk,First try out of the box while gluing 2 boards it broke. Medium pressure on the handle caused it to snap off. These clamps are not good for joining boards together. Stick to bar or pipe clamps.
5,Cute,"Nice product! Everything was in great condition. The stamps are nice, the ink is not dry, the pencils work and the box is a nice bonus for storing everything. Great product. Well worth the money. Great packing and fast delivery."
5,Fun set,"My daughter got this for her 5th birthday. She doesn't even like horses, but likes to use the stampers and make up stories about what the horses are doing. She also likes to color in and draw items along with the stamps, so it's great for her imagination... and to help her illustrate the ""books"" she's started to make now that she's learning to read/spell."
3,Nice gift,"Nice toy, realistic stamps. Child liked it, then put aside. Will need to see how it does after the holiday bustle."
3,Nice set but...,...one of our stamps was a repeat. I would have rated this 5 stars if it had all of the correct stamps.
4,horse stamps,"My daughter loves horses and playing with stamps so this set was a perfect match for her. My daughter loves this set. The only problem that I have with this set is the clean up. Now, I don't know much about stamping; but my mother does and she has a pad that you can spray a cleaner on and brush the stamps clean. This set didn't come with anything to make clean up easy."
5,Horse Stamp Set,Fast shipping! I ordered this stamp set for my horse camp girls to use it for an art project. They made bookmarks and Thank You cards for the owners of the horses they were using.
4,my horse-crazy daughter loves this!,"My daughter was absolutely thrilled to receive this stamp set as a gift. She likes the realistic look of the horses and their scenery. I have to say that I also prefer the idea of her creating projects with realistic horses and not ""pretty ponies"". The stamps work well, though the stamp pad included is a little small. We have many other Melissa and Doug products in our home, and they tend to be very durable. I'm pleased with both the quality and the price!"
1,The Seller Was Out of Stock,"When I searched for this item, I found it. But, after purchasing it, the seller came back that the item didn't exist. I am happy with the quick response and refund. But, the item itself is unaccounted for and therefore not a good review."
5,An amazing experience..,"This is not just a book..it's an experience that takes the reader on an incredible journey through time and history..and beyond! It's about humankind and its fantastic, diverse spiritual development through the ages, but at the same time also about each and every one of us personally, whoever and wherever we may be.The writing is so clear, the content so spell-binding and the consequences so mind-boggling I was profoundly immersed in it for weeks.Sorry Amazon, this one I'll keep forever..to start re-reading soon!"
4,The author knows what action/adventure lovers want!,"This is the second book in the Nina Steel Adventure series. I have to first admit that I have read all three books in the series about a year ago, but not in order. I would suggest to anyone that they read the series in order, which is the only problem with the books. If you don't read them in order you can get confused as one book leads into the next. I started reading Banking on Torture around 9pm with the idea I would read a few chapters before going to bed. Eight hours later I finished the book. Wow! The problem was there just wasn't any break in the action. I love it when you can't stop reading. That really says something about the author, he knows what action/adventure lovers want! Banking on Torture takes you to a new level of international banking."
1,Can't get it,"So i have been waxing my underarms for years, used to use microwave wax but when we got rid of the microwave i started using Nads which works well but is more expensive so i thought i'd give this a go. I'm not sure what the trick is, i tried thin layers, thick layers, the crappy paper strips that it comes with, my own cloth strips, my underarms are red and sore, but still hairy. I KNOW how to wax, and i CAN'T get this stuff to work. Waste of my money and time (and pain)."
2,"Easy to clean up, but doesn't work well...","I've used this product twice since I bought it the other day...I cannot get this product to work...I have been waxing for years...some of the other reviewers said it took a while to get the hang of it and maybe that is true, but it shouldn't be so hard! It really does wipe away nicely with warm water, which is great if you are attempting to wax your brows and misplace the wax...but I couldn't get the wax to take away more than a few hairs at a time on my legs, Ouch!"
1,Not Worth It,"This gel is easy to clean up but the process is VERY tedious and you get VERY sticky in the process. You have to apply the gel JUST right in order to get results. In my opinion, it's just too much work... I don't have hours to spend practicing until I get it right. There are MUCH better products out there."
3,It's alright....,"At first i bought it, i was really excited and kinda nervous . >< and it worked pretty well and got most of my hairs off my legs. but i had to practice to get MORE hair off. u have to apply a VERY VERY VERY THIN layer of the gel to be more effective.it lasted about 5-6 weeks for me. but sad thing was, my hair grew thicker and longer than before. it says that the hair will be thinner but my hair grew thicker.. =( now it hurts more to pull my hair out than my first try.. sucks but oh well."
2,Newbie...but still can tell this does nothing...but pain...,So I bought this..recommended by my sister...and then I read the reviews...yea all of them are bad reviews...but I gave the product the benefit of the doubt...I took me 30 mins and 3 sheets...and was like NOPE!! no more...I tried it on my fingers...it pretty much just pulled my hair...not even out...so I figured ok...patch too small..so I tried it on my legs...lilttle bit better results...it pulled out probably 35% of the hair...but even in the patched were it looked like a good patch of hair is gone...I rubbed my fingers over it and it wasnt smooth...I could feel some thinner hairs were still there...I was dissappointed but I guess I was warned...granted this was my first time self waxing...but I feel that I should have accomplished more even though Im new at this...
1,worst waxing I ever tried,Waxing with this product has the same result as you would put honey on your hair and then lay the strip over and pull. It doesn't remove ANY HAIR!!! I would take it off the market because it is USELESS!!! And now I have to go to the store again and get something that really works. What a waste of time!!!
1,Does Not Work!,"I should have read these reviews before buying this product. Albeit it was my first attempt at brow and lip waxing, but this didn't do anything. And, like the other reviewers, I tried putting it on thin and thick, and it still didn't work. I will try another product and am returning this one, thankfully I saved my receipt. How can they even market this product, it's like putting soap on your skin and rubbing it off, nothing happened at all!!"
3,THEY GOT THE DISCRIPTION ALL MESSED UP!,"That gurl that said the water doesnt cum out was wrong, u have 2 PULL UP on the rocks!! This toy is pretty fun., by the way the doll w/this set comes with the MONKEYS!!! Thx 4 reading this,Darcy, age 11"
4,PP Hot Tub Review,"Am very pleased with it and my daughter loves it. Recommend you put a towel underneath because of the water, but what's a little spilled water compared to making your child happy."
3,Terribly Incomplete,"The basic problem for this 2-disc set is exactly what I condemned in the 1 disc Ultimate Waylon Jennings: it fails to include 'Honky Tonk Heroes' and 'Lonesome, Orn'ry, and Mean' Not only are those two songs among Waylon's definite 15 best; they are 2 of the 6 that each singly can be said to define Waylon ( the others are 'Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way,' 'Good Hearted Woman,' 'Luckenbach, Texas,' and 'Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys'). It is bad enough to omit that pair of masterpieces on a 1 disc 'best of,' but it is criminally stupid to omit them on a double-disc set of 40 songs.RCA has already made a fortune on Waylon, and it can rake in more bucks by doing the right thing and re-issuing this set, with 3-4 added tracks. Most who bought this disc would buy the expanded re-issue, and many who refused to purchase this set (like me) would buy the expanded re-issue."
2,Not the same??,My first Lucky Day was not like the other I bought? It ia already empty--It seemed I only had a few sprays? I shook it good but it is done.Roger A Palmbos
1,Not as cool as it looks,"I just put one of these into my new Honda Pilot and I hesitate to give it even 1 star.First of all, when loading a cd into the deck, it takes an extremely long time for the music to start.Once the music finally starts, it skips really bad. I tried several different audio and MP3 discs, but they all had the same result. I looked the discs over for scratches or anything else that might cause that, and there was nothing that should cause a car deck to skip.Once the car started moving, the tiniest bumps in the road would cause this deck to skip and start the loading/reading process all over again.Radio stations don't come in very well. After checking the antennae connection several times, local stations are barely audible and mostly fuzz.A car deck should really be more durable and less sensitive to bumps and small blemishes in cds. And there is no excuse to not be able to pick up a radio station or two.Don't buy this deck. Go with a Pioneer or JVC instead."
3,The root of all evil.,"This pre-Travis McGee John D. MacDonald crime novel does not hook you from the beginning. The first three chapters show little promise as MacDonald draws verbal character portraits which strongly suggest The Price of Murder is going to be merely a hackneyed melodrama pitting good against evil.Fortunately, by chapter 4, things start to heat up as the novel's underlying plot begins unfolding in earnest. The Price of Murder is a tale of hardboiled crime wherein greed and covetousness lead to multiple shocking murders in a small city somewhere in the American heartland.This is a book which starts off slow but in subsequent chapters gets better and better. Recommended to aficionados of hardboiled crime."
1,buyer beware,"Alan Moore's Another Suburban Romance is an attempt to make a buck off Moore's name. Avatar Press actually calls it a ""graphic novel,"" but it isn't. This book is based on Moore's performance works. In other words, someone has taken Moore's words, drew illustrations (black and white) for them, and placed them in some kind of sequential order (no, Moore isn't the one who did it).The truth is, ASR consists of three illustrated ""poems,"" only one of which (the title piece) is any good.Save your money; if you are interested, pick it up off the shelf at your local comic book store, and start reading it. (You can read the whole thing in less than 10 minutes.) After reading some of it, my guess is that you'll place it back on the shelf.If you are interested in Moore, read Watchmen, Promethea, Swamp Thing, or just about anything else, and forget ASR."
1,Another Avatar Ripoff.......,"Once again, Avatar backs the truck up to the Alan Moore cash vault by releasing a ""Graphic Novel"" composed of adaptations of Moore's poetry. To be fair, I am NOT a fan of poetry, no matter WHO the author is. Although I love Alan Moore's work, I resent being tricked by Avatar, not once, not twice, but a whopping THREE times, with their so-called ""Original"" Alan Moore graphic novels. The art, by Juan Jose Ryp, is really nice; It's intricate detail is reminiscent of Geoff Darrow's work on Hard Boiled and The Big Guy and Rusty the Boy Robot, but great art in the service of a non-existent story is meaningless. Poetry fans might like this, but I didn't. This is the LAST time I'll be burned by Avatar."
4,A very readable history of American Civil War Naval Battles,"This is an out-of-print three volume set. It reads like a novel and the only reason I don't give it five stars is because it could use more photographs, maps and drawings than it has."
2,missing the civil war at sea,"Jones writes an attractive and generally engaging narrative of nautical aspects of the American Civil War. Because he is a glorifier of the ""Lost Cause,"" his episodes tend to favor Confederate exploits. As a result Jones misses the woods for the trees. He says almost nothing about the U. S. industrial effort or the chores of blockading or, surprisingly, much about diplomatic elements of the struggle. (This may be because many of the activities violated British law. No mention in the text of the ""Alabama claims,"" the U.K.'s eventual settlement of damages.)The authors of the prefaces, mainly naval historians, save the day in so far as they identify the important dimensions of the conflict, in particular the possibility of mobile warfare. Only on the last two pages or so of his three volumes does J. take note of the importance of the U. S. Navy. So, dear reader, enjoy, but do not expect to learn much of importance about the Civil War at sea."
1,"Important, but amateurish","While the premise of this book is absolutely wonderful, I have to say that I was highly disappointed. Hansen does an admirable job presenting the real life hardships of the mentally challenged and those who love and work with them, but the book seemed stilted and almost ""too"" autobiographical at times. By expanding his personal experiences, what seems only a limited degree, the author has flattened the characters and taken some of the interest out of his story. There was little emotion in the dialogue and character struggles, and even the heart-wrenching climax seemed distant and contrived. It was a good effort and an important story, but just not what I had hoped."
3,A short read but fun nonetheless,"I read the book in an afternoon, but I enjoyed it. About a teenage boy who is disabled. I think people should read it. Or at least learn more about disabled children because there are many ignorant people out there."
4,"A good read, Enjoyable.","This is the first book by Hansen; I know because we read it as part of our book club. That being said I was impressed that this young author touched upon some very important issues. Although I read one review by Andi Miller saying it was amateurish, I wouldn't go that far. It was certainly done by a new author, but very well written nonetheless. It was a tad short, sure, but I loved the beginning and the way all the characters were woven.The story is about a disabled boy and his problems in a highschool with all the so-called ""normal"" kids. I won't spoil the ending but it is very very exciting and heart-wrenching. I encourage all people with an interest in disabled kids to read it. I look forward to reading more of Hansen's stuff. I don't think this story is personalized at all -- it is a short read but reads really well and I loved it."
4,Good read.,"Ok, here we go. Like the book, slow at start but then it picked up and really went to town. Didn't know much about Disabled kids, but the book was fairly educative.Liked the main character, Joan. Had spunk. Most women in books don't have spunk anymore, so it was a pleasure to read a man who could write from a female perspective. Ending was fantastic, I laughed, I cried."
1,A gross misrepresentation,"Heider misquotes and misrepresents people continuously. In some cases she attributes positions to them that were the complete opposite of what they said. She misspells names and gets basic facts wrong. She claimed, for instance, that Malthus was the first to apply Darwin's theory of evolution to social issues. Malthus wrote his book before Darwin was born and was dead before Darwin wrote his first work on evolution. Her research was shoddy and amateurish and she quite blantantly distorts and falsifies positions taken by people. One of the worst books on the topic and virtually worthless. It can not be trusted even in basic facts."
1,Very deceiving description,"The description says 12pcs, beware you are only getting one filter NOT 12pcs like in the description."
3,nothing fancy here...,"this does help with the odor but when i do change the litter i spray this with some fabreeze to ""refresh"" it. I also rinse/wash it once a week and let it dry by the window."
2,Van Ness Filters,"When I ordered, after much hunting for the filter(s), I thought I was getting a packet of several. Needless to say, I paid a hefty delivery fee for a packet of ONE lone filter. I can't seem to get these anywhere else...including the Pet stores that keep these nice large boxes, so I was NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!!The boxes take two -ya think ya could put TWO in the package, Sunshine???"
2,Hed Kandi - Mark Doyle = Forgettable...,"I absolutely loved the first three installments of this series, but since it's ""rebirth"" last year, I've been completely disappointed with the selections. Apart from a few good tracks (Koop, Aim, Kenneth Bager), this compilation is pretty lackluster. I've been waiting for another Winter Chill album since 2005, but with the direction Serve Chilled has taken since Mark's departure, I can only imagine that it would also be a disappointment."
3,Out of date now. Here is an alternate recommendation.,"I am the author/publisher. This reference was useful 15 years ago, but today it is out-of-date and out of print. -- Instead, if you want a current reference, I recommend the book by Donald Pipkin, ""Halting the Hacker: A Practical Guide to Computer Security (With CD-ROM)."" Pipkin's book is available here on Amazon.com. Also, check Amazon for Computer Security titles specific to your needs in networking, firewalls, identity theft or other aspects of security."
2,Not a good source for prep,"It is like reading a table of contents...does not really read like a text book.Red Hat has a very difficult test, and this book will not prepare you for the exam."
3,RHCE Guidelines,"This book tries to cover all topics of exams for RHCT and RHCE.It is helpfull because it guides you beyond the various topics, but It shows just the basic configuration of services, probably because just them is required on exams.At the end of all chapthers are good exercises that helps you to fix the concepts learned before."
3,Good Book - Just beware,"Great Book for RHEL version 3 of the test. Currently exam focuses on RHEL 4. This is a significant change in email services and other services which could hinder the test taker.Although it is in the notes, CENTOS operating system is a great way to practice on RHEL without a license to the Red Hat version.It is a step by step guide, if RHCE was still on version 3 I would say it was a great book."
5,"Read this, Do the Labs in it, Pass the first time.","My Background: I have about 8 or 9 years or Linux admin experience, My full time job is as a Linux Administrator.I got this book about a month before I was scheduled to take the exam. I went through the book, doing every lab, even if I thought I knew that particular subject matter. This book covered the list of things to know on Red Hats website in depth.With the combination of the RH300 class and this book, I was able to easily pass the RHCE on my first try. I highly recommend it to anyone prepping for the exam."
5,Excellent Study Guide,"This is one of the best study guides I've read. Some people expect that a book should take you from novice to master simply by reading it. The truth is you only get out of it the effort you put into it. Some of the examples in the book were remedial for me, others not so much. I think this book provides good information for those that will take the time to use it and learn from it. I will be taking my RHCE exam in a few months, and look forward to passing it. This book is a good resource for anyone serious about taking the RHCE exam."
2,"No CD, despite the summary above.","Review of the Fifth Edition, out of the box: Despite what the summary from the Author states above, this book comes with no CD. The PDF version of the book, which I used heavily for reading on the train, is no longer a part of this product. The sample tests are now paper and pencil.I will read this book, but I will not pre-order again from this publisher again."
3,"Big book, but don't expect just reading it will get you through the test...","But if you are studying for the RHCE you already knew that.... I am working my way through this book, and the Red Hat official class guide to prep for the exam, not to mention working on the systems on a daily basis. The challenge is working through the aspects of the system that are not related to your day to day job. You really need a small network, or just a virtual network of boxes at home to test and practice on.What I would LOVE to see in one of these test prep books / software packages is the sorts of labs, practices and simulations similar to the actual Red Hat material."
3,RHCE Red Hat Certified Engineer Linux Study Guide (Exam RH302) (Certification Press),"Overall good information. But the author makes too many assumptions and provides little details for complex topics, such as LVM and physical device configuration. However, in fairness to the author, this is NOT a book to learn LINUX. The book prepares you for the RHCE test. That's why the author assumes that you know LINUX already."
4,Great exam prep book and desk reference,I plan to take the example later next year. Great resource overall. Would be nice if there is a soft copy on cd.
5,Great Exam Prep,"I wish I could say I had finished the book and passed the RHCE, but I am still a month or two away. Still, I have advanced my Linux knowledge significantly and am having a blast. Of the 6 or so Linux books I own, this is the best and should have been the first. If you are thinking about taking the RHCE or are just wanting to make Linux admin easier and/or more straightforward, then this book is a must have."
3,Good content except for an unbelievable number of typos,The subject is covered well but the book is full of typos and they are not unimportant typos. The examples have many errors. You just can't trust it.Osborne has an errata file for the book on their web site but only for the 3rd ed. and it is useless for the 4th ed. Osborne get your act together!
2,Good but in need of revision,"The whole book is a good source to study for the RHCE, but it has a lot of mistakes, some of them i believe could had been avoid with a simple review before publish. It is also not completely updated for RHEL5."
2,Great book but outadated,Great book for somebody whom wants to learn Linux but this book is outdated and is nothing like the test. Don't waste your money if you think this book will help you pass the test.
3,Decent Book for RHEL 5,"This is a decent book to get background on the RHCE exam and have an idea as to what it would take to pass. However, the one I purchased was for RHEL 5, which wasn't completely applicable to RHEL 6, especially given the changes made to the structure of the Redhat exams. That was the only option in the time frame I had to get my certification, however. This book was well written, and easy to understand. I did, however, find a different book more helpful to me:Hands-on Guide to the Red Hat Exams: RHCSA' and RHCE Cert Guide and Lab Manual (Certification Guide)"
1,An experience that I would not repeat it!,"I have not received the item(the book)yet. I ordered the item 4 months ago. I sent many emails asking for refund, No feedback from Amazon"
2,disappointment!!!,"there's nothing that's exceptional in this album. i was so let down by how mediocre their production was on here compared to their past work with the b.c.c. - if you dont believe me, make sure you listen to the samples above. i read the reviews for their other album 'brace 4 impak' and i think that i wont even attempt to listen to it.if you dont know who da beatminerz are; this cd is still a lack luster album. save your money."
1,Total ripoff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a huge fan of Huggies but these preemie diapers suck! They don't hold up on preemies and I know for a fact since I am the mother of a premature baby. You get more for your money with Huggies Newborn Diapers which hold up better and will last your baby longer than these. Mothers, just because you have a preemie doesn't mean you need to get these diapers. Preemies are expensive enough, it is completely unnecessary to piss away money on a product like this. This is just a shrewd marketing campaign Huggies and Pampers are launching to fatten their pockets. Don't give in and regret it later."
1,Useless,"I was given these diapers as a present when my premature son came home and at a skinny four pounds, these were too small for him. Now my son is slim in the hips and tush and these are supposed to hold up to six pounds? I couldn't get the tabs around him. All I ended up with was frustration and my son shooting me his sh*t eating grin while i struggled with these! Preemies are very fast growers so buy the Newborn diapers and skip these and anything else labeled preemie! I got the newborn diapers for him and they lasted up intil he was six months! What does that say about preemie diapers? They are a waste of money, don't get them you will regret it!"
1,These are a waste of money,"I AM THE MOTHER OF A PREEMIE AND THESE DIAPERS ARE A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE HUGGIES AND WILL ONLY PUT MY SON IN HUGGIES, BUT PARENTS OF PREEMIES, LISTEN TO MY PLEA AND PLEASE DON'T BUY THESE DIAPERS! MY SON CAME HOME AT 4 POUNDS AND MY AUNT GOT ME A PACK OF THESE AND HE OUTGREW THEM BY THE FIRST WEEK! PREEMIES WILL SPROUT LIKE CRAZY WHEN THEY COME HOME SO DON'T LOAD UP ON THESE AND OTHER PREEMIE DIPARES AND CLOTHING. BUY HUGGIES NEWBORN INSTEAD. THEY WILL SUIT YOUR PREEMIE LONGER, THESE AREN'T WORTH THE PRICE AND THE LIMITED WEAR YOU WILL GET OUT OF THEM. I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE AND OUT OF CONCERN FOR PARENTS ON A LIMITED BUDGET WHO HAVE YET TO SEE OR ALREADY KNOW WHAT A PREEMIE WILL COST. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND USE IT ON A NICE DINNER OR HUGGIES NEWBORN DIAPERS!"
1,Takes Forever,"Ordered this video almost a month ago and still haven't gotten it yet!! Amazon needs to get off their rear and ship products on time intead of equivocating with customers about ""out of stock"" and ship their orders!Bad customer service on this one!!"
4,Great Solo Effort,"I Got this disk i think 2 Years, ago i still listening this CD, there are great songs on this disk .. the Remake of Sabbath song called Jerusalem is almost great as the original version of the Tyr Album .. the Hot spots in this disk are ...the Ballad if There's a Heaven, Great song, great Vocal Performance by Mr Martin, Why Love and Title Song ..Recommend for the fans that like the Sabbath CD's with Tony Martin on vocals .. this CD is more soft than the sabbath CD's but worth a listen ..."
5,All you need for MOS certification for Project 2002,"I spent 2 months on this book, and practised using the trial software that came with the book. Believe me - that was all I needed to get certified. I just needed one attempt! No retaking business at all. I am now Microsoft Office Specialist in Microsoft Project 2002! I did not spend on any other training or books. This book deserves 5 stars and nothing less. Thanks to the authors who did a splendid job."
5,Best book out there,"You can learn every topic listed in this book using this book all by itself. It has the clearest introduction to these topics that I have seen. I read this book from start to finish, and it was a revelation every step of the way."
3,Worth a read,"Fans of Futurama will greatly enjoy this volume, while it may not be worth the buy for most, if you like comics this is a book for you. While the stories are uninspired, and probably not even written by Matt Greoning,they are enjoyable and fun to read. Except story four, blah!"
4,Classic Dixieland from trumpet player Muggsy Spanier,"------------------------------------------------------------Muggsy Spanier""The Chronological Classics: 1949-1954""(French Classics, 2005)------------------------------------------------------------Later recordings from trumpet player Muggsy Spanier, who was one of the major Dixieland/trad jazz player, particularly among those who stuck to the old style long after swing and bebop swept the jazz world. This disc is split between ""sweet"" and ""hot"" material: I prefer the slower, sweet style, and there's plenty of it here, including an epic, ten-minute jam on ""Careless Love,"" with some particularly lyrical riffs. If you enjoy artists like Sidney Bechet, Eddie Condon or Jess Stacy, Spanier's right up there in their league. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To World Music)"
5,well pleased,"This product was the best thing for me. For years I kept my beautiful porcelain horses in a box for fear they might get broken. Since I used this product to secure them, I have no fear they will fall over."
4,Compares Well to Sticky Tack,"Quake Hold is very similar to Sticky Tack, the blue or yellow stuff widely sold at discount stores and supermarkets for hanging posters and such. If your application isn't very demanding, you should probably try Sticky Tack first, as it's very cheap.Quake Hold is noticeably denser than Sticky Tack. It takes a bit more muscle to work it into the desired shape, but in return, it gives you stronger holding power. The color is also far better for blending into the surroundings. For my money, I like it better."
1,Not good for posters,I have used a similar putty in the past for posters. I bought this and used it but the posters fell down after about 3 months.
4,Great product!,"This product works very well as described. I have a small antique store and use it a lot to secure fragile items. The items can be easily picked up when a customer wants a closer look or to purchase, but the item remains secure when in place. I also like that the product can be easily removed from an item and re-used over and over. I also use the product at home to secure items that I don't want to get knocked over. I live near the ocean and get strong breezes when I open doors or windows and have previously had items blown over and broken."
5,Cats and glass,"I have a collection of glass figurines. I also have a collection of felines. Without museum putty, I couldn't have both!"
5,Quakehold!~ Museum Putty,This is a great product. I bought it for the pictures in our office so they will stay straight on the wall. Once there it does not come off until you take it off. You don't even see it. People just think you are great at hanging pictures. And I like that!
5,Fantastic adhesive,"As a teacher, I spend an inordinate amount of time putting posters on my classroom walls to inspire and instruct my students. Too many of the products sold for this purpose have proved ... well, ""inadequate"" would be kind. Coming in each morning to find another poster (or several) on the floor is not the best way to begin the day.This year, I decided to try some alternatives to the usual types. Quakehold! 88111 Museum Putty is just fantastic. Once up, what it holds stays up. I even subjected it to a severe test - I am using it to hold a framed poster on a paper covered bulletin board. It has not budged a millimeter."
5,VERY QUICK SHIPPING! GREAT SELLER!,"GREAT ITEMS. WE USED IT TO KEEP OUR GRANDMA'S PHONE SECURE TO HER TABLE, AT HER HOME. SHE KEPT DROPPING HER PHONE AND NOW IT IS SECURE AND DOESN'T GET ""DROPPED"" OR KNOCKED OFF ANYMORE. IT COMES OFF EASILY AND CLEANS UP AS IF NEVER THERE."
4,Good for klutzes,"I have a lot of glass in my home but sadly no grace. If I brush against something this saves it. Not really sure what I would do without it actually--clean up broken glass frequently? Buy everything in plastic? I don't really like either of these alternatives. Depending on where you plan on putting it though it can be unsightly (little white blobs if you put it under something clear), so take that into consideration. There's another product if you need see-through."
1,Not for Wall Hanging,"I bought this to hang a laminated world map in my child's room. Despite using plenty of it, it fell off the wall in less than a month, and the putty is not sticky at all anymore. We have a slightly textured wall, but it seems like museum-grade putty should be able to adhere to it. And it's not clear why after a month...it's not sticky anymore. Perhaps it works for objects stuck to a flat horizontal surface, but it didn't on our wall."
2,did not work well for me,I tried this on a small accessory piece for a ceramic village. It did not hold up the item. Perhap I needed more practice.Jean
3,Too long,"It's okay. I wanted this book because when I was in Seminary we were required to purchase ""What are they saying about Isaiah"". So I wanted to see what they were saying about the Pauline Churches. Too long and not interesting enough for me."
2,Disappointing,Good information that's a struggle to use because it's written by people who have assumed that access to a word processing application makes them publishable writers: hire an editor!
4,Best Rusalka on record,"I recommend this recording highly. There are a great many recordings of Rusalka available now, but the title role has been given an idiosyncratic twist by nearly every soprano who sings it. I especially dislike the recording with Teresa Stratas because of the lack of a legato line. Also, the various conductors have sometimes tedious tempi that really make the music drag. This recording has a wonderful Rusalka, a sweet-voiced tenor singing the prince, and a conductor who really has a feel for the right tempi -- not too slow! Except for some quality control problems with the recording itself, I like this recording the best of all the available Rusalka recordings. I especially like the characterization of Rusalka and the prince by the singers. Overall, it is the best performance of this opera that one is likely to hear."
3,Item acceptable,The item is good if it would stay in place. It moves to the side and won't stay centered in the heel.
3,Chase a Rainbow by Sandra Field,"Back Cover:Tascha Dennis hadn't crossed a continent for romantic adventure, she'd left Montreal for Whitehorse convinced that somewhere in the Yukon wilderness was the father she had never known.But the one man who could help her, Seth Curtis, owner of a lodge rumored to be close to her father's hideaway stubbornly defended the man's privacy. Even Seth's electrifying interest in Tascha could't allay his suspicions of her motives.So Tascha chose her option-going to the lodge behind Seth's back, knowning that in pursuing one dream, she may have forfeited another."
4,I could not put it down!,"I read this book in a weekend. I didn't expect to finish it so fast, but I just couldn't put it down once I started it. Things happen in this book that could happen to any of us. The characters are very down to Earth. I recommend this book; it will keep you wanting to know more with each page."
5,Great book,"I do living history and make many of the items I use including armour. This book has a weath of information on the subject, clearly written and great photo in color. I would recomend this book for all living history members and even the causal reader."
2,R-296 White Toaster Oven-reconditioned,"I had been looking for a Krups white toaster oven, but didn't want to pay [too much]. I ordered this reconditioned unit on-line last year. It cost [not too much] including shipping, came promptly, and looked perfect. It quit heating entirely after about 2 months of minimal use (about once per week.) I didn't remember where I got it, so it sits in my kitchen holding papers."
1,toster oven,"Arrived promptly, looks brand new. During initial test started smoking-the broiler tray required cleaning (oil-I think on the surface).Toster is slow to heat, slow to toast, slow to bake. Suggests a problem with the thermostat???I gave it away & bought a new one (Black and Decker) which operates far superior."
3,olympus headphones,good construction but sound is really deep sounding even with adjustments on pc. Would be good for music but hard to hear dictation
1,not good,This is the worst headset I have ever purchased. I cannot hear anything clearly out of these. I wish I would have spent a little more and got the better set. My earbuds for my MP3 player sound better than these ~ and I only spent three dollars on them!
2,Bad sound quality,"The headset was comfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. It may be okay for music but NOT ok for transcription."
1,Not good quality sound.,"The sound quality of this headset was not good. The box had Olympus on it, but I really do not think it was an Olympus headset. May be good for general listening, but definitely not good for transcription."
2,A Book That Misses the Forest for the Trees,"After reading this book, I found myself disappointed with an author that seemed to miss opportunity after opportunity for insightful analysis and instead focused on the minutiae of, say, the banter between an M.C. and a pageant contestant in a decades old tape of the Miss America pageant. Unless one is for some reason in need of highly detailed information on the proceedings of past Miss America pageants, I would suggest looking elsewhere for a book about beauty pageant culture."
3,It's okay... I guess,"I actually bought this because I went to highschool with one of the directors (I haven't kept in touch with them, but I thought I would check it out). The action scenes in most of the shorts are really great, the stuntwork is amazing, and the production values are suprisingly decent.I think the main shortcoming is the short-film format. Without any sort of development of the characters, there's no real reason to be interested in the action.Action without a story just sort of becomes monotonous. I'd be a lot more engaged in the action if I were playing Soul Caliber II. If you're really into fighting, then maybe it wouldn't be as boring to you as it was for me."
4,Nice for the price!,"Nice product, better looking than the picture and the colors match a tie that I have. I paid much less than they are currently selling for (I think I paid $3. yes, $3.) so watch for sales from this seller."
3,initial setup,"It seems like a nice machine. Two concerns were that the holes did not lineup to fasten down the actual fan portion of the unit, so I had to drill new holes in the right spot. Also the six inch imput splits into two 4 inch imputs, one of which was cracked slightly when I unpacked it."
1,BAD MOTORS!!,PURCHASED THIS ITEM APPROX. 1 AND 1/2 YEAR AGO. NEVER USED IT TILL YESTERDAY. AFTER ONLY ONE HOUR OF OPERATION THE MOTOR BURNED UP! WIRES IN MOTOR RUBBED THE WINDINGS AND SHORTED THEM OUT. I GET TO EAT THIS ONE CAUSE OF THE DELAY IN USE. THE DAY YOU GET YOURS PUT TIME ON IT EVEN IF ITS NOT CONNECTED TO A SYSTEM! RUN IT FOR HOURS AND DAYS. IF IT MAKES IT MORE THAN TWO DAYS YOU GOT A GOOD ONE AND NOT A LEMON.
2,Very disappointing picture and sound,"As a huge fan of the Sheena TV series, and as the owner of all the episodes on VHS, I can't tell tell you how disappointed I was when viewing the two discs in this set. I would rate the picture quality as ""fair to poor"". Most of the episodes look like an COPY of an EP-recorded VHS tape, with a very soft and sometimes blurry picture. The picture quality of my SP-recorded VHS tapes is considerably better than the quality of these DVD's.The sound quality is also below par, somewhat muffled, as opposed to crisp and clear. Wow, what a MAJOR disappointment!Hopefully the release of 15 of these episodes on three DVD's from Alpha Video on September 25 will do justice to the picture and the sound of these wonderful episodes. Until then, I would advise you against purchasing this version."
1,Not for latest IPAQ,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this combination does not work with the new IPAQ 3800 series, especially if you try to carry it with the protective sleeve that already comes with the IPAQ. In addition, the Stowaway Keyboard requires an extra adaptor piece to attach with the 3800 series, and there is no place to put that in the case."
1,Not worth it,I purchased this item for use with a Palm Vx and a Palm folding keyboard. The flap closure is almost useless and the zipper broke within a week.
4,Nice PDA Case,"I only have 1 problem with this case, and it's the lack of belt clip or another sort of hanger. the lack of this make it unpractical to use it outside the briefcase."
1,Wait for redesign,"Great idea, poor execution. The Stowaway Keyboard does not fit in case. Current product is unusable."
1,Doesn't fit the Palm portable folding keyboard,I was beside myself with joy when I saw this at Best Buy. Fortunately I asked the guy if I could try putting my keyboard in it and it didn't fit.I wish it were a little bigger--it's a great idea!
4,Handy Dandy,"Like this one. In black leather looking professional with my suits. It's Very handy and always keep my PDA in very goodcondition. I dropped my PDA couple of times since I bought it,but hey! no harm done since this handy dandy saved my PDA's life.It fits very well with my PDA too."
2,A bit too snug,"This case has a looped leather closure, which really should be a zippered one.The keyboard compartment is indeed SNUG. It's a challenge to get the keyboard in. Forget it if you're in hurry.The PDA comparment is fine.This case lacks business card slots and comes with one credit card type of slot. I need something about 20% roomier."
3,think again before making a purchase.,"stowaway keyboard is well protected on it's own. metal shielded when it's fold. Ipaq already come with protected case. what people really need is bag to put in accessories. such as cables, adaptors, CF memories.. etc. I feel redundent opening the zipper to find everything is already protected inside."
5,Great 9v battery charger,"I've been using this to record sermons 3 times a week for a year now. It charges very fast, within 2 hours, even the larger 275mah battery and shows green when it's finished."
1,MAKES MORE WORK!,"So I have had cats for the last 8 years- and I have had my share of cat litter concepts and failures.I used the van ness sifting pan before.. and ended up returning it a few days later.My cat would use the box- and when I went to sift- the urine would stick to the grate and I had to ""whack"" it out or scrape it off the grate. This made it more work than just basic scooping.I would not recommend this product at all."
1,Would not recommend,"This SOUNDED like a great idea. The problem is that with the clumping litter, the cat urine clogs up the holes in the sifter, and is hard to clean. I used it for about a month, and then took the sifter out. I just use it as a regular litter pan. It does have a snap on piece that serves at a shield to keep my cat from scratching litter everyplace. I would not recommend it. I'm sure there are other litter pans available with the shield."
2,Not good for FELINE PINE,"Someone's review claimed this litter box is good for the Feline Pine pellets.. NOT TRUE! The pellets fit exactly in the grid. You can shake a bit of the sawdust through, but for the most part, it's a huge hassle because the holes are all blocked with the pellets! It makes a huge mess! SO BUMMED I just wasted ~$20 on this thing! (Get the official Feline Pine sifting box.)"
1,Sad disappointment,"I already had a sifting pan from another vendor that I really liked. Unable to find another, I decided to try this brand. All the complaints listed turned out to be pretty accurate. I even tried the technique recommended by one person to pour it out through the sifter, rather than putting the sifter in first. It would be easier to just get a regular pan and use a hand scooper. I'll be going back to my sifting sheets; I get a relatively clean layer each time, and after the ten sheets are gone, I just change the litter."
2,Not the best if you have more than one cat,"Urine will glob up the sifting clay litter and stick in the sifting holes. You have to bang the crap out of it to get it out, literally. I do have more than one cat and sift the pan daily, more than once if needed. But in the end it is not worth it. Go for the Breeze if you want a sifting box with NO SMELL!"
5,Buy several --my plan,"I bought this but lifting up the litter and pouring it into the empty pan after sifting the waste out, each day was heavy lifting. I bought 7 and used only the sifters from six of them. Then each morning I lift out one sifter and set aside. By the end of the week it is not so heavy to lift. It makes sifting out the waste a snap.Downside: Need more litter to fill up past all the sifters. Messy to store the sifters after lifting out. Need a large mouth reseptacle for dumping the waste.But I use this in an outbuilding. Not recommended for in the house."
4,Sifting Cat Litter Pan,"This is exactly what I needed for my cat's litter. It allows for easy, quick sifting that eliminates scooping. It works best with clumping litter."
5,VanNess Large Framed Sifting Cat Litter Pan,"I purchased two of the Van Ness sifitng pans so I could put them together and get four days of sifting rather than two. The sifting litter pans are very easy to use and I liked them so much that I contacted Van Ness to see if I could get 3 more sifitng sections, so I could clean the litter 7 days in a row rather than 4. I was very dissapointed when I recieved an e-mail stating that they would not sell the sifting sections separately. Since I bought two of them, I drilled wholes in the extra solid pans and they work great. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it."
4,"No more fishing around for that one clump, pickup the top and toss.",Theres no such thing as a pleasant litter box. Even the fancy automatic ones have some quirky problem. This works as it should when you use cat litter that clumps properly. Generally I use Scoop Away but the Tidy Cats has worked fine for me as well. I've even successfully used the Feline Pine pellets in this in the past. My cat has an annoying habit of over-compensating when he scratches around in the litter so this puts a nice stop to that.
1,Messy,"Too messy - sifting the litter creates a lot of dust which goes right into my nose. Also, the pan is too low near the entrance, resulting in a lot of spilled litter. And finally, the process of disassembling, sifting, reassembling takes longer than scooping. I will use the pans for something else."
1,Inconvenient,"I've always used the regular ""litter tray with the scooper"" procedure but when I saw this type, it seemed too good to be true. It was. When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional ""sweeping step"" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have ""strained"" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method."
3,Not for wood pellets,"I bought this on the chance that it might work for wood pellets. The simple answer is 'no'. The sifting tray sits directly on the bottom of the main box, meaning that wood pellet dust has nowhere to go other than the small amount that would fill the sifting tray mesh. I'm sure it would work well with normal clumping clay litter, but for wood pellets it gives no advantage. It does seem well constructed and if I were using clumping litter I would probably give it 5 stars."
2,Good concept; however there was still a mess to clean up.,"Although the concept of this product was good, it still provded to be quite messy. I am not using the sifter because of that."
2,doesn't work,"We are using Pine litter. It doesn't work as expected. It makes a big mess when sifting, also it's hard to sift because the unused bits stuck at the bottom, and the powdery part will not go through.We are going back to our old Booda Dome litter box."
1,Waste of Money!,"If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. The description sounds great but what they forgot to mention is that when the urine clumps up it doesn't go through the spaces. This cat litter box causes triple the mess to clean up. Buyer beware. Don't waste your money!"
1,Bad Product,"The door on the litter box gets stuck inside the box, trapping your cat inside.Avoid this product."
4,Comfort floated from the poems,"The poems were very insightful and I found comfort within the pages. Since I am a person who reacts to colors of nature, flowers, sunshine and the endless green, yellow, red and blue, the paintings did not hold the light for me."
1,Bad..Bad..Bad,I Needed a device to change recessed baby spots in a high ceiling. Device has a suction cup about the size of a fifty cent piece. You put this on top of an extension pole. The writers of the descriptive blurb give the impression of a one tool serve all device. This is misleading. They should work for P T Barnum.Anyone need an extension pole???
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap!!,Very Cheap Product. Handle Broke. Attachments broke. I bought two and both broke during the first use. I would not recommend this product.
5,Roosters,I love the way it accents my kitchen when I have the covers on my stove. I collect roosters and that just sets it for me
3,Misled Info,"The product was very reasonably priced and shipped in a reasonable amount of time. However, when I bought the book nowhere in the item listing did it say unedited proof. It wasn't a final published copy, so there were mistakes in it which confused my daughter who was reading it for school. The product description could have been clearer."
4,If you have a racing saddle and wedge pack you need this,"This product is great. I only wish you had an option to choose this fixer or the standard fixer that the wedge pack comes with. For this reason, I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Fits perfectly on the narrower seat rails of the racing saddle. I tried to attach the one the pack came with and even though I got it to fit it just did not sit properly on the rails because of the wider bracket. I have read other reviews about the wedge pack and how the fixer breaks or they do not fit right well this is the reason why. Get this and you will have no problems. They should put this as an option to buy when you click on the wedge packs. I put the standard on my mountain bike and it fits like it is suppose to. Now I can switch the bag between bikes with ease."
5,Works as advertised,This works on a Fizik Arione Wing flex. The one included with the saddle bag purchase (not the f22) do not.
5,Excellent fit and function,The F22 wedge pack adapter works great for fitting your favourite wedge pack to a racing saddle. If you buy one for each bike then you can just easily switch the pack around. This is the fixer that SHOULD come with the pack when purchased.
5,Very Exciting,This book kept me turning the pages I was so excited about how Roy MacGregor uses suspense in his novels and this one is no different. Very good read.
4,Good,This is one of the good Screech Owl books. I would recomend i to anyone so go and but it today.
5,x-acto alternative,"I love these chisel blades for scraping and cleaning the surface of materials. I felt these blades had a sharper and more solid edge then the x-acto equvalent, at half the cost."
3,haven't used yet,"I haven't had a chance to read this yet, I'll update the review when I get around to reading the book"
5,Book,This is a great little book to help with identifying gemstones. It has easy to understand language and very nice photos.
2,Not One Of The Best,"This was the first book that I've ever read by James Neal Harvey. I have to say the artistry on the front of the book does absoulately nothing for the actual contents inside of it. I found this book to be a very slow read, that is until the last 100 pages. Near the end things seemed to pick up and go quickly along. The romance that was in the book was rushed through, there was too much police talk in the beginning which may have been what turned me off a little bit. I just didn't find the book to be as captivating as I thought it would be. This only proves one thing ""NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER""!"
5,"A FAST PACE, THRILLER! A MUST READ!!!",I'm sure you already know what it is about so i will get to the basics. I found the book to be an interesting thriller. the kind of book you don't want to put down! Not just this book but the others i've read by James Neal Harvey are just as great! I highly suggest you pick up this book!
5,"If you want the best, you'll find it here","No one can touch this guy in terms of finger style. I usually play this CD in my car to/from work, and by the time I reach my destination, I feel better. Highly recommend"
1,"This is LIVE ACTION, not ANIME!!!!","I wish I'd kept on reading!!! The first review i saw was a review of the animated series which i had seen a bit of to get me interested, the next one said ""this is not anime"" and bashed it, so i assumed they just meant it was so bad it shouldn't be considered anime...i would have realized this was a power ranger-esque live action show if i read more reviews, and the lack of picture is misleading too; if they showed the cover, a real person(Miko Mido) being grabbed by slimy tentacles, it totally would have been clear this is no cartoon! I too am out $40 like every person who got this horrible cartoon-to-reality junk before reading enough reviews to make a sound judgement, zero stars, not one, i just didn't see a ""no stars"" entry."
3,"A bit tame, but all good","First and foremost, I'm a HUGE fan of the series. I've seen LaBlue Girl 1-6, and let me tell you, this is where it's at. Some say it's for wankers. Damn skippy. It's nothing more than a porno in anime. But no porno I've seen is this spectacularly engrossing, this dramatically staged, and this, uhem, effective, as LaBlue Girl. If you are looking for something for the family, don't even think of getting this. If you don't like any cartoon erotica, pass this by. But if you are looking to have some serious adult anime fun, get the box set, you will not be dissapointed. Oh, and don't even think about getting the dubbed version, it does not do it justice at all! Get the subtitled version and get ready to fly>"
1,It Ain't Anime,"Not anime at all, lacking entirely the erotic power and vividness of the Japanese animators. Instead it's a crude live-action thing done on a mini-budget with extremely bad actors going through the motions. The special effects are shameful by Poverty Row 1947 standards. The plot is one of those crazed demon things, with cruel strains of sexual anger throughout (typical of anime, I know, but not in any way justified by elegance of execution). Really, a mess and E-bay should be ashamed of listing such a shoddy product as ""anime."" It ain't anime!"
3,anime hardcore for a narrow audience,"Story follows a young Japanese girl who's ancestral mission is to fight demons with sex. Yes, you read me correctly. Fast paced, slightly comic, graphic violence, nudity and sex. Main character's (I forget her name)sister is kidnapped and taken to underworld where our hero must battle the legion of monsters and grotesques who threaten to overcome good with evil, guess who wins. For those still interested,it should be a unique, memorable experience. Recommended for serious anime collectors with high tolerance levels. My version was subtitled, would recommend dub if available."
1,amonra311,"I wouldent even give this a star to begin with!!! WTF!!! I mean, this isnt even anything close to anime!!! All it really is, is a warped perverted version of the power rangers. And it dosent live up to what the cartoon is. (----THIS IS NOT A CARTOON!!! THIS IS LIVE PEOPLE TRYING TO IMATATE WHAT THEY SAW IN THE CARTOON) I was veary disapointed in the product placement of the ad.I give it no stars and now im 40 dollers or so out because of this garbage! but if you dont believe me, i cant stop you from buying this."
5,Fun at the movies,This is a great film for people who like to see demon tentacles raping women. There's nothing more erotic than a woman screaming in fear and pain because a myriad of tentacles penises are forcing themselves on her. This movie has human sex intercourse in it so believe men it's porn.
1,An attempt to get around the reasonable distaste with rape.,"I suppose if its monsters engaged in rape, then its not really rape. Bizarre to say the least. Interesting and effective animation. Not entirely what I expected to say the least."
3,Classic Erotic Anime,"Much more than just a ""cartoon porno"" La Blue Girl shows the kind of imaginative perversion that I have only seen in Anime. Summary: a young Tokyo girl fights a sexual battle against demons from another dimension to save earth. I think. Very graphic! Awesome!"
4,"Pretty decent, though not for the faint of heart (or kids)","Plot is a bit cheesy, but the La Blue Girl series is still pretty good anime for adults. Decent animation and FX. Little weird, little freaky, lots of monsters and other gnarly stuff. If you like this one, then you'll love the rest of the series- they DO get better."
5,ATTENTION TENTACLE LOVERS,"The first movie in the series has poor picture quality, but gets better each movie. This is very HARDCORE and should only be watched if you have a strong stomach and love tentacles!!!"
2,Rape porn hidden under the guise of Anime,"This movie is rape after rape with the occasional masturbation cene. Nothing interesting happens. If you want porn, you can surely find one that doesn't contain the continual rape of teenagers. Granted, I have nothing againstn those who make, stock, or buy this kind of Anime, but the fact that it is so pervasive in the US paints an un fair and often incorrect view of anime, and of Japanese culture."
4,Mmm Mmm Good!,Pretty good Chai Tea. I saved plenty of money from Starbucks by simply making myself a cup of Chai in my home or office. Would recommend to anyone!
1,mr,Wrong item was sent. Vanilla chai is not the same as Spice chai. I've been ordering this one several times. I am very disappointed with this one!
3,Great at first but something went wrong,"I'm a chai enthusiast, so when I first tasted this, I was excited. It's not ""authentic"" but it was milky and sweet with a kick. After the 2nd canister, however, the taste changed and it just wasn't good anymore. I don't know what happened. I had to trash the entire pack."
2,Weak....,"This chai latte mix is weak and not creamy. For Starbucks like taste, try the Big Train canister."
4,PAcific Spice Chai Latte,Spicey and tasty. You can make it with water or milk. Even add a paddy of butter for more creamy flavor
5,Great watch for the price!,I bought this for my step mother and she is very happy with it. It was exactly what she wanted.
4,Nice CD,"Nice compilation of songs by various popular artists, my personal favorite is Michael W. Smith's track To The King Eternal"
1,"KEEPING UP APPEARANCES, SETS 5 TO 8",this the second time I have been asked to evaluate this set. DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY READ THESE EVALUATIONS???? I stated previously that the sets NEVER ARRIVED!!! If Amazon could please check into the problem I would deeply appreciate it. Don Martin
5,I love this show! Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth is hysterical!,"I'm glad I am able to buy this show on DVD. I'm no longer able to watch it on PBS and, of course, it's convenient to pop in the DVD and watch the show whenever I want. I recommend both box sets. My favorite episode in this box set is ""What to Wear When Yachting""."
5,A great read to keep you turning pages as fast as you can,This is a great read for middle-graders on up. Smart-mouthed but insecure Allie puts on a good self-defense act and alienates herself from family and those who might become friends. Her obsession with funerals (of people she doesn't know) and trying to unravel the mystery of what or who really killed Jimmy Muller will keep you turning pages as fast as you can read.
3,Light reading,I enjoyed this book it was a great read for my holiday!The characters stood out and created real interest..... I will be reading more from this author
4,Highly entertaining,Enjoyed the book. Will no doubt read nook three of the series. The third book has to be a good one also.
5,The best thing since Lego,These items are awesome! Not only does my 9 year old play for hours with them but his 13 year sister and her friends love them too. What a great creative diversion away from video games.
3,the Nurember war crimes trial,I expexted to read more of the testimonies but what was there wasn't very interesting. maybe that is the way it was. the book was very dry reading. i still haven't finished reading it and it is a rather slim volume.
4,Zyxel G3000H,"The product works well. I was able to attach up to 7 machines and block those machines from the internal network. The setup is tricky and some of the parameters don't make sense to you until you call tech support. You will recieve a live person fairly quickly but their direct knowledge on the product will be hesitant but still helpful. I ended up resolving the issue myself but most likely their initial support guided me in the right direction.I wasn't able to test the distance this device will reach becuase I was in a small area and it did fine. For security it's great, especially if you want to protect the internal network becuase it uses Layer 2 isolation."
3,Gabriel 49228 shock review,Shocks were delivered on time without issues but shocks do not come with the hold down nuts or the mounting bushingsas you have to use the old ones from shocks being replaced. All air lines and fittings were present & worked without any issues. I replaced the OEM air self-adjusting shocks on my Pontiac SSEI and set air pressure at 40psi and did not set off the level sensor warning. Increased cornering and stability was noticed over old stock shocks as I was trying to accomplish.
3,G Shocks,"The shocks ride very nice, better then stock, but I only gave them a 3 because they need a boot to cover the exposed shaft. This most likley shorten the life of the shock."
1,oh dear,"And I thought you people couldn't get any nuttier. The music is crap, the message is wonderful until you realise he's worshipping someone who doesn't exist. Also, what's with the (...) You people reaaly need to consider getting a (...) Also if you were a true Christian you'd (a) not mention your Cadillac, flouting your wealth to all around you, or (b) give the money to the needy and buy a cheap car. Hypocrite."
3,Further reading on Hilarion,"Hilarion the Healer: The Apostle Paul Reborn (Meet the Master) (Meet the Master)An interesting booklet offering a structured path to follow.I feel that there are too many affermations (108 in all) which although helpful to some, will distract others from the more important lessons on concentration. However if I remember rightly there are 108 beads on a Japmala and you could work with each affermation allocating 1 to a bead!However if you are new to the pathway and need guidance to begin you on you way to self Mastery then the step by step guide at the fron of the book should be helpful.There is no subtitution,for a good physical teacher offering tuition.A good one will not charge much if anything."
4,dated but fun for young readers,"Originally published in 1960, this tale of a curious cow is dated and has its problems by today's standards, since the cow is constantly chastised for being curious and is told that it's liked despite its curious nature, but an author's note after the story tells boys & girls that it's actually GOOD for kids to be curious. Little ones will enjoy the low key but amusing color drawing and the situations that Katy gets herself into.Lots of pages but not too much text"
4,MOOVING,"Wonderful story and pictures. An excellent opportunity for adults to explain to children animals other than human are neither good/bad or curious. That children are neither good nor bad. That children are naturally curious and often require guidance. The guidance has nothing related to good or evil. Strictly possible outcome. Is the parent, just observed, telling their child, if you go into the street you will be killed, or another recent observation,if you go out at night, the monsters will get you, in anyway being anything but being mentally lazy? Everything human is choice."
4,A bit expensive but good quality craftmanship,I would rate this item higher had it been a two piece unit.The escutcheon plate is welded to the pipe and if you have an uneven wall as I do you will need to caulk around it. It is a good quality item and comes packed very carefully. I had no problems installing and is just the right length for my shower.Would recommend.
5,Gorski get it right.,I've read dozens of relationship books and this is the best. Not only is it great for personal application but it's a wonderful source for information that we need to be teaching each and every one of our children.
4,Better than a plastic strap,I think that the packs should come with this type of connector to start instead of the plastic strap and plastic bolt that that eventually wore out and snapped...I use this new connector to hold on a Topeak mobile phone bag onto my mt. bike frame since I ride alone a lot and I use different gps tracking sw on my iPhone. I also trust this connector/bag to hold my vehicle keys.Around 2 seasons and this connector is still strong and trustworthy.
2,Plastic....what do you expect?,"I gave this a 2 star instead of a 1 because it does workbut because the mount is plastic, the very first time I made a move that pushed on the phone pack, it snapped the plastic. I'm going to need to return or replace this and two other non-durable Topeak plastic parts."
5,A Collection as Rich and Tasty as any old Christmas Pudding,"This collection featuring the words and music of Christmas is the perfect companion for a quiet December or January evening. The world's greatest poets and writers are represented here in all of their Yuletide glory in renderings by some of Britain's finest actors. Whether you're getting into the Christmas spirit following Thanksgiving's turkey dinner or savoring the full twelve days of Christmas (Remember, you have until January 6th!), this two-disc set is a must have for any lover of the history, lore and prose of the season. Heap another log upon the fire, pour yourself a mug of wassail, dim the lights and enjoy this most delicious treat. Happy Christmas!"
3,Thumboard Caveats,1)When trying to install the software found it conflicts with the Targus Keyboard and hangs the Visor. Disable the Targus Keyboard driver before installing and the install will work ok.2)The Thumboard program interferes with the working of the alarm function. The alarm will sound but the alarm display is suppressed and you won't be able to deactivate the alarm. The only way to deactivate the alarm is to disable the Thumboard and reset the alarmed item to activate again. Then both the original alarm and the reset alarm will display and can then be cancelled.Out side of these 2 items it works as advertised. The Manual is Tiwanglesh but is still understandable.
2,Annoying glitch,There's an annoying glitch when powering off my Visor Deluxe via the Thumboard half the time the unit goes into Hotsynch mode...I then have to physically pullout the Thumboard unit and turn the power off...no doubt this is probably not good for my Visor. I've contacted Seiko-Austin via email and they have yet to reply. Very frustrating!!! If I wasnt in Japan I would have returned this product back to Amazon. A friend of mine also had the same problem with his Thumboard...so be careful. If it wasnt for this pesky problem I would easily give the unit 5 stars as its works well otherwise.
2,Not particularly useful.,"I thought this product might make it easier and faster to enter data into my Handspring Visor but frankly it was wasted money.First, the keyboard is harder to use than the touch screen keyboard. If you have 'average' size fingers you'll spend a lot of time correcting errors.Second, it adds bulk to your PDA - and isn't that why you have a PDA in the first place, to improve portability? Just another thing to drag along.Third, it lacks intuitiveness (is that a word?) - well, some things are just about impossible to figure out...Overall, if you need to enter data into your PDA you're better off using your PC or buying a full size or folding keyboard (if you need portability a folding unit isn't that much bigger).I'd really hoped this product would solve my spur of the moment input needs, but I guess I'll have to learn to use the stylus."
4,An interesting keyboard alternative,"I'm not very good with the graffiti function on my Handspring, so I purchased this little gizmo to save myself the trouble. While the lure of the Targus stowaway (or something similar) may seem impossible to ignore, the Thumboard is ideal for ""snap and go"" people like me. There's no unfolding or need for elbow room with this little guy--it's near the size of a Gameboy and just as easy to hold. While typing may feel a little awkward at first, it's nothing that time and a little practice won't fix.But! Be warned that the glitch that you've read about in other reviews is a rather common one. I have the same problem with the ""On/Off"" button sometimes activating my HotSync function. Other than that minor annoyance, it's rather a handy little piece of technology to add to your Handspring collection--and at this price, it's hard to pass up!"
3,Pretty neat for the right visor...,As already mentioned in other reviews - make sure you only have one keyboard driver activated - the targus and this one conflict.One point that might come in handy is that this is NOT compatible with the VISOR PRISM (dang).
3,DOES NOT WORK ON VISOR PRISM,"Bought this thinking that it would work on my prism (that is the color one) and it does not fit. Otherwise, i would have liked it to work, it is really nice. Like a blackberry!"
2,Not very good.,"The thumboard has the following flaws:1) Very big, hard to hold with one hand.2) Does not fit very well3) Does not work with visor phoneOn the plus side, I can type about 20 wpm with it."
4,almost a year now,"I purchased this keyboard last January. I could live without it, but I've found that it makes entering text a lot easier. I have had some of the same problems that others have had with it. I've found that if you wiggle the keyboard while its connected to your visor, and the visor is on, then problems with hotsync are more likely.My biggest issue with this product is that I couldn't ship it outside USA. I had to ship it to a US address and then get it forwarded to Canada. Well I have it now, and you can't have it back."
2,Clearly Marked Manufacturer Price of $2.99,Amazon listed the towel as a $5.00 towel--NOT. It is thin and of the same quality as the ones at the 99cents store. I was expecting very nice towels and received low or standard quality at the price on the label.
3,Cannon Vertical Rib Cotton Kitchen Towel,Love the color and size. It really doesn't absorb water. If you want it as a decoration to accent your kitchen then it's a great price.
5,graded lamb,"Most lamb is actually not graded by USDA. But, a very select amount of domestic lamb does get graded USDA Prime. It is rare, but it is absolutely valid. I sell meat to white tablecloth restaurants and this is where the USDA Prime lamb products go (Not to retail)."
1,meat head,I didn't know the USDA graded lamb...much less had a Prime grade for it. I think this is miss leading advertising.I didn't buy this item because I don't believe this is a valid grading for Lamb.
5,Great CD - thoroughly enjoy it,"I really enjoy this CD and most or all of Curtis Stephan's music. His ""Born To Us"" CD is one of my favorite Christmas CDs."
5,A must read for church leaders considering a survey,The Gallup Guide is informative and gives one all the tools they need to successfully survey the congregation. The chapter on the Lay of the Land is packed full of details about individual spirituality and people's perceptions and needs of the church. The data points that the church of the future will be shaped by the laity taking and increase role in discerning the will of God for the church and their lives. In the chapters that follow all the details to completing and analyzing a survey is concisely laid out in an easy to follow manner. This book even contains ten reproducible surveys. After reading this book I had everything I needed to successfully survey my congregation. In addition it is great to read a book written by Michael Lindsay and George Gallup because they are leaders in their churches and realize that this book is only a tool in discerning God's will for the church. I highly recommend this book to any church leader.
4,Funny Money,"It is about time! We have been waiting for YEARS for this book. I have read all of the Haskel Blevins novels and loved them all. I have loaned out these books some many times that I had to buy a new set. When you start reading Funny Money, just like all of the rest of these books, you feel like you have found some old friends again. The characters are wonderful and the story line is really good. It is nice to have a mystery that makes you laugh out loud. However there was 1 loose end left unaccounted for - who was responsible for the incident with the garage door? Ms. McCafferty, please don't make us wait this long again."
5,LOVE this bed wedge!,"My husband just had surgery and has been in bed for the better part of a month. This wedge has given him the back and neck support he needs, as well as extreme comfort that is welcomed when in one position for long periods of time. The little neck pillow moves with him when he slides up or down in bed. The only down side we have with bed wedge is where to store it when not in use. It's huge!!"
1,Too huge to use to sleep on,"I ordered this and just could not believe how huge it was when I got it. I tried placing it in every possible angle and there just is no way in the world you can use to sleep on. I wanted something to replace the three pillows I use to make a wedge shape that I sleep with - this had such high ratings every place I checked that I took a leap and spent the obscene amount they want for it. It's not worth it if you're looking for something to prop you up a bit so you can sleep. This is solely for sitting up in bed to read or eat of something else where you need to sit up straight. If you want to relax and sit back and go to sleep with an incline, this isn't the pillow to get!"
3,They do what they are supposed to do,"These coasters really do soak up the water when your glass sweats. And they are very unique.My one complaint is I realize since these are all original designs and no two are alike. But two of mine came with a very wide gray shaded area. It makes the coasters look dirty. So I have to put those on the bottom of the stack because they are ugly. If they were all like the other two that do not have the gray area, then they would have gotten 5 stars.So these do perform well - but in order to leave them out on display, they need to be inspected for huge defects before being mailed out by the seller.UPDATE 08/20/10These coasters chip VERY easily. I do not have kids and these are used very gently, but still they have all gotten chips out of the edge of them. Wish they were a bit more durable! Do not buy if you have little ones or will use these often cuz I do not think they will last long. Just my opinion."
1,"This book is a waste of money, it is very poor","I have actually reviewed this book for publication but the journal's policy is to not use negative reviews so it never appeared. It is difficult in just 1,000 words to summarize my review but I will say that the book is loaded with technical deficiencies, flat-out errors and inconsistencies that make it a very poor reference work. Furthermore, it was translated by someone who knew nothing of minerals so the errors introduced by the translator are monumental, hundreds! There are terms devised by the translator that mean nothing to English readers and don't appear in any other mineral/gem book of any kind!A truly bad look, yet it enjoys good sales because the public is so ill-informed about mineralogy."
4,A reviewers are not equal,"After reading a negative review on these pages at the advice of the reviewer I bought the Cambridge book he recommended. That was a mistake. Whereas the Cambridge book is a good reference book with lots of technical info and good photographs, it has not one photograph of rock in the field - precisely what I need. I've since purchased Schumann's Hand Book and I like it considerably more. The Cambridge book will sit on my shelf, Schuman's will get out in the field and serve me well."
5,Great book,This book is packed with useful information. I fing the book helpful in my exploration of minerals and rocks as well.
5,Go with the real deal,"I have had a Xerox solid ink printer for 8 years. For most of those years, I have been using after market ink sticks. I recently decided to do some personal comparisons, and I wanted to share my results. First of all, there is no comparison in the vibrancy of the colors when you compare Xerox ink to the generic counterparts. I did some bind testing with friends and family, and the results were unanimous. Also, the Xerox ink produces more pages per stick. I alternated the Xerox ink with an aftermarket brand in my printer and found that the Xerox ink consistently produced 25% more pages per stick. So when you are comparison shopping, you can add at least 25% to real cost of generic brands. I buy most of my ink on Amazon now, but I have a local business that I try to frequent also. The price of their generic is $60 , and the Xerox is $80. Add 25%, and there is only a $5 difference in the real cost of ink, but the results far outweigh the cost savings in my opinion."
3,WWE Night of Champions 2011 Review,"The tag team title match was not great but pretty good with the DQ ending to ruin it. The IC title match between Cody Rhodes & Ted Dibiase Jr was passable. The 4 way bout for the US title was good in trems of 4 ways. The Worlds title match between Randy Otron & Mark Henry was a classic David & Goliath battle but this time,Goliath(Mark Henry)won. The Divas title match between Kelly Kelly & Beth Phoenix was also not great but pretty good. The WWE title match between Alberto Del Rio & John Cena was a mediocre bout with a predictable John Cena win to make it worse. The No-DQ Match between Triple H & CM Punk was a smash-mouth,wild,hardcore & ruthless brawl. I give this event a 7 out of 10."
5,Enjoyed it vey much,It plays very well and came 2 my home with in a few days. It didn't freeze up at all.
1,Big disappointment,"I got this for my 9 year old nephew who was initially very excited about it. It turned out to be a big disappointment. It moves relatively fast through the water but has little power when it comes to the ""soaking"". It produces a thin stream of water - nothing to write home about. The batteries are difficult to install and only last a few hours (even in the off position) ... this resulted in us having to replace the batteries every time anybody wants to play with it. I would definitely not buy this again and think it was not worth the money."
3,Intresting,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK HAD A GOOD STORY BUT IT FELT RUSHED. It was too short. but a nice twist ending as usual
2,Not good,"Not how it used to be the story was predictable which is why I gave it two starsNeed to bring the old stories to kindle hunted mask, say cheese and die and etc."
3,UPDATED: Now would give it four and a half stars,"UPDATE ADDED: After continuing to read this book, I want to change my review to 4 1/2 stars. It really picks up steam in the last half and I have been really enjoying it. There is much more of a storytelling element.(ORIGINAL REVIEW) This is a very well researched book, but I found that the author often would tell of one event, such as the Five Dollar Day, and just repeat the same basic things over and over again. This makes for a very stilted and somewhat rambling account. I wish he would have stuck more to storytelling and less to reactions from others."
5,The most accurate of all,"I read many books and articles about the Ford Dynasty, but this one is much better than most. The author really did some research."
3,BARGAIN BOOKS!!!!!!!!!,"This is a review of the condition of the book - not the content of the book.I purchased this because I enjoy biographies of iconic American figures - and at 7.99 this book is hard to pass up so I figured I would add it to m y collection.This book came wrapped in celephane as a new book would - with a tight binding and inexpensive material for binder cover. The pages at the end of the book did not line up as the same width along the edge where you open the book. It looks like a 100 year old library book where pages could be falling out.The paper quality for a hardcover book is also below what one would expect. Most of my paperbacks have a better quality more durable paper than this book does.I guess I'll chalk this up to "" You get what you pay for "" but If I paid full price for this book - I'd definitely send it back for anohter copy.I'll try and update the content review of this book later after I read the book. But I'm currently reading another title."
2,Opinionated and Verbose,"While the facts are presented in a more or less historical fashion (Watts jumps from one year to the next and then back again with dizzying speed) the author continually and exhaustively repeats himself. He resorts to quoting newspapers of the day (make that ALL of the newspapers of the day) to reinforce his already over-stated and rambling views. In fact, one wonders how much of this book was actually written by the author. Three out of four paragraphs on every page are nothing more than quotes from newspaper articles. The title of the book should be something along the line of, ""Henry Ford -- According to the Newspapers -- With a Smattering of Left Wing Collegiate Opinion Thrown-In for Good Measure.""A long-winded, anti-corporate, pro-Marxist-Unionist perspective by a college professor obviously hoping for PBS to turn this voluminous sleeping pill into an equally borish mini-series."
3,The People's Tycoon,"Content is great, riveting story, but the book is too small with font size also being too small. Feels like a cheap book where you didn't get your money's worth compared to the other larger more normal size books that are similar biography subject matters. Further, whilst the content and life story are rich in detail, it lacks so many historical photographs that are quite accessible only to find a handful of photos from this highly accomplished man rather including many photographic images that his other contemporaries of his time included."
2,"nice pictures, but not as helpful as Fodor's Japan","I read both this book and Fodor's Japan prior to two trips to Japan (Kyoto, Hiroshima, Miyajima, Fuji, Tokyo, Kanazawa, Toba). While this book contained nice, glossy photos, it was heavy and lacking in the detail to be helpful as a guide that could be carried around. If you want a Fodor's publication, get the most recent edition of Fodor's Japan instead. Don't forget to use the Japan National Tourist Organization as a supplement. They are accessible on the internet and in various major cities."
1,Not Based on Science - Not Based on Reality,"The introduction to this book states: ""The people who have prepared this book have tried consistently to put the Word of God first and science second."" and ""If the conclusions contradict the Word of God, the conclusions are wrong, no matter how many scientific facts may appear to back them.""This book promotes creationism, which is rejected as a pseudoscience by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of Biology Teachers and the National Science Teachers Association. Parents and students should be aware that any student who uses this book as a science book may be damaged by it, as it rejects generally accepted scientific knowledge and explicitly rejects the scientific methodology generally accepted by the scientific community."
5,wall charger,This satisfied the need for the charger. The one I owned previously fell apart and I paid a lot more for it.
3,Good deal,"Works just fine. I have to add words here so they will let me post this review, review and review."
1,Not what I expected,"The bridge was unfinished, as in not having grooves for strings. The strings are off center from the fingerboard. I am thinking I will send this back. Very unhappy.I also did not realize this was considered a ""Toy"""
2,Wont stay in tune,"I'm not a violinist but i've always wanted a violin. Since i wasn't very serious about learning the instrument, i decided to go with a cheap model and got what i payed for. I've spent more time trying to tune this thing then actually learning how to play. When you somehow finish tuning it, you have a small window to play it before it goes out of tune again."
1,Very disappointed!,"I just received a violin and I'm very disappointed at what I saw.(Actually, when I picked up the box, I was wondering why it was so light weight!)It doesn't look like the nice violin in the photo on Amazon,also doesn't look like the pretty violin in photo from other customers uploaded earlier.The violin I got has plain pegs, looks different than the photo.The violin case is different, too! Not as nice as the photo.Anyway, the violin with case which the Seller sent to me is very cheaply made.I'm very sure that I didn't receive the violin I paid for.I ordered the violin because I saw the nice photos from other customers uploaded.But the violin the seller sent to me doesn't have the same quality and appearance.I'm trying to contact with the seller and return it.I will update my review later.Update on May 13.Thanks to Amazon! I just got the notice that they will send the refund to my card."
1,broke,The tailpiece on this violin broke on me soon after I received it. The wood was just bad. Don't believe the 75% discount because nobody would ever pay $300 for this thing and it's not even worth $100. It's better to buy a violin in person at a music store. At least I got a refund.
2,Ahhhh My Heart is Broken,"Well after reading all reviews I decide to purchase this as a gift yesterday with special delivery which was perfect I receive it today, but here is down part it doesn't even look a like the one you see in picture, and too small and come with broken bow(I mean hair broken from middle) I think they send me wrong one. I suppose to give this as a gift tomorrow and I think I am so shame to do that.can anyone tells me how I can solve this problem I mean I wants to know if they send me right product, coz every thing look so different even the box..Thanks in advanceKami Ali"
3,Worth Seeing for McQueen and Rest of Cast,"By no means a great or even good comedy, it is worth seeing for a rare comedic role for Steven McQueen and for the supporting cast of Paula Prentiss, Jim Hutton, Jack Weston and Dean Jagger. Together, they make the most of a weak script based on a very minor play. Will watch again. There are some funny scenes, but for the most part, it comes across as a quickly adapted play. There were scratches on the DVD."
4,good comedy,the part was meant for steve mcqueen. enjoyed the lighter side and you will see why so many big names picked this movie as a vehicle for their craft. well done
1,poor reading of a lousy book,not worthy of a TV movieI may have enjoyed it more past the dismal reading but I doubt it.a cliche tale with the stink of the author all over it.
2,DVD watcher,"I bought this DVD for the Stallion Canyon as it was filmed in Kanab, Utah, and it was the first movie for Ken Curtis. The quality isn't very good and it isn't that great a movie. But being familiar with Kanab, it was fun to watch a movie made there (over 200 movies and TV shows have been filmed in and around Kanab, Utah)."
1,For the MONEY..!!!,"I agree 100% with Patrick Noonan (reviewer) this CD should have been a nice well done combination of tunes & musicians, instead it is a lifeless, un-imaginative fuax attempt at spinning a project for MONEY.Don't buy this CD.Perhaps someone with real bluegrass chops from the actual tradition of bluegrass will do this properly someday.THIS IS NOT IT...."
1,Neither bluegrass nor Floyd,"Alas, I bought this elsewhere without reading the reviews below, which with the glaring exception of ""Mortie"" give you a good sense of the false advertising at work here. What you get here is not Floyd, nor really bluegrass. Instead it's competent playing but of odd, pointless, or simply dull arrangements with little flair -- listen to the ""Wish You Were Here"" or ""Comfortably Numb"" samples available here and you'll know all you need to. Or I'll save you the trouble: all you need to know is, buy something else."
1,STOP -- YOU'RE ALL WRONG,"There is YET ANOTHER Pink Floyd bluegrass album that DOES have ""blazing harmonica"" -- some of the most amazing playing I have heard, on the song ""Money"", at least. I am visiting this site because I'm trying to find it, BUT IT IS NOT THIS ALBUM as a quick listen to the sample of ""Money"" here attests."
3,A great twist on Pink Floyds work,"I liked this CD very much, but I love Pink Floyd and Blue Grass music so it was a home run!"
5,What an ending!,"Until this series, I had only watched a few series (Tenchi Muyo & various spinoffs, Ranma 1/2, Gundam Wing)This one ranks no. 1 as my favorite, with Ai Yori Aoshi as a close second. They do a very good job about tying up all the loose ends, and closing off the series in a spectacular way. I highly recommend getting this DVD, and enjoy the conclusion!"
4,Great story about a boy adjusting to a new dad!,This story is about a boy with a hard time adjusting to his dad's death and his new dad. A dog named smoke helps him grow up and think of someone besides himself. Earl Holliman did a great job in his part of the patient and understanding step dad. This is a great family film and we enjoyed it. Too bad more films aren't this good.A Concerned Christian Parent
5,Smoke,Ron Howard stars in this film. It was nice seeing him in one of his childhood roles. It did serve to demonstrate some of the difficulties that can occur in blended families.
4,smoked cheese...,"...made for sun. pm movie of early 70's which was a 'lil better than i thought; its entertaining thruout with enough varied scenes. wish it had just a lil more action; andy devine-always a trip,(in this show, who did the flipper series w/ luke halpin-also a trip-who became marine tech. advisor for water based films but hard to find as an extra in few movies like the remake of mid 60's movie flipper) boy did i drift off; so what, a good extra trivia info."
5,Holy Hot Gun Batman:),"""Well what can I say except...excellent!!!! A word of warning my friends, it gets really really hot!! When you glue something you need to be very cautious because the first time I used it I burned myself. All in all it is a great product:)"""
4,my favorite live Ween CD,"All Request Live is my favorite ""live"" CD from Ween so far. I like this one better than Paintin The Town Brown and At The Cat's Cradle. Having the 5 part Stallion all together is really cool and the highlight of the disc. Happy Colored Marbles, Cover It With Gas and Set It On Fire, and Reggaejunkiejew are also outstanding on here. The whole CD, originally performed and broadcast live on 7/22/2003, is a great performance by an amazing band."
1,no luck,"Bought these Anco's due to price and needed winter blades. I have a 2010 Dodge Ram and these wiper blades work lousy. Always jumping on the windshield. When driving down the interstate forget it, misses whole parts of windshield. I bought four and tried all four and they all do not work. I think the cheap price reflects performance. I some reviews had good luck, but I did not. Am searching Amazon for better wipers."
4,can't stop listening to it!,I had been lusting after this album for some time and finally ordered it last week. I have never been to India but love the music. I can't stop listening to this album. It's so much fun and so quirky. Dramatic and fun to dance to...buy it if you like music of the Indian cinema!!
2,Top 40,"Each song sounds like (U.S) top 40, every decade represented. The only difference is the language. I was bored."
5,Hilarious!,"For those with a dark sense of humor, this book is for you. With bright candy-colored graphics, the author recounts Oopsy's bad day. It's like a children's book for adults, with some minor drug references to a ""bad trip"" and other unfortunate incidents. I liked this book better than the author's previous ""Emily the Strange."" I also purchased the ""Oops I said the f-word journal"" and Oopsy Daisy's Fold and Mail stationery, two really cool artsy accessories. This book just made me laugh out loud."
1,Beware of Overstock,"Sent me a used item, to the point of worn out. Item description said new. Thay have not replyed to my concern. Beware of this company (Overstock.com)!!"
1,Very Poor,"I installed this item, used it for about two weeks and it came apart while I was driving. I'm in the process of trying to find the best glue to repair it."
1,Junk,Bought this for my golf cart which I use to do home utility and yard work. It lasted a couple of weeks and then the ball came off the shaft.
4,The Hollywood Jr,"You know what? At least in 2010 we have the son of one of Hollywoods greatest yest most underappreciated stars, yes full of bravdo and double talk, maybe Leo Gorcey knew all along maybe my son will carry on, I mean heck I did give him a full dance card."
3,Didn't Like It,"I couldn't finish this book and returned it to the library. Fortunately I did not purchase it. I was excited to read it, but after the first few chapters I quit. I read LOTS of bios, but this one I couldn't get into. His style of writing I think it was. He wrote mostly from the first person and in the speech manner which Leo Gorcey used in his films, but this made it difficult. I would have much preferred a straight forward biography and the authors personal thoughts tossed in. It just wasn't the kind of book I like."
1,judea,the book to me seemed to blame leo gorcey for everything wrong in the life of his son.i never saw a side of leo that was anything close to what is being said in his sons book. his praise of his step mother brandy just dose not fit or have any ring of truth.leo gorcey drank himself to death and that is sad to say the least but i cant believe he was a monster as this book seems to paint that picture. leo was special and very gifted.
3,Need the Cradle,Cable does not stay in hand held very well. When you push the hotsync button it will fall out.Skip this and try and find yourself a serial cradle for your palm.
2,"Sorry, but this is disppointing at best","I don't know what album the other reviewers are listening too, but it can't be the one I've got. I'm a HUGE Kim Wilson fan, I just love Kid Ramos to death, and the T-Birds have always been in high rotation in my house. But this? This is ""Kim Wilson and the Contractual Commitments featuring Kid Ramos""Seriously, if you want live Kim Wilson, get ""Smoking Joint"" if you want live T-Birds, get ""Different Tacos"" and any of Ramos' solo albums are way better than this. (And if you enjoy hearing Gene Taylor play 8-to-the-bar octaves, there's no hope for you, so buy this...)I'm giving this 2 stars only because I like Wilson's voice, and Ramos does his usual crack job on most of it.But T-Birds?!?? No way, man."
4,T-Bird blast,"The California Geoseismic Institute must have sworn The Big Quake had hit LA when these guys hit the stage and let loose on ""The Things I Used to Do."" David ""Kid"" Ramos romps-there's no better word-on guitar behind the bulldozer drumwork of Steve Hodges, Willie Campbell's relentless bass, and Gene Taylor's cracking piano. However, it's Kim's love of singing that makes him the perfect lead vocalist: he can hold a phrase in his voice like Aretha Franklin until the dials jump on their own (check it out on the aforementioned ""Things""), and there's that great baritone barrel chest to support it. Even better, when he grabs the harmonica and starts to pump, it literally buzzes like a giant barber's electric shears. Whooo, you can feel it right down to your shoes! This is what a house party should look and sound like."
3,Ok but...,"My daughter got this for her Bday and she loves it. I wish the slide connected to the pool a bit better. It is always falling off/down, you get the picture. She is constantly fixing it when she is playing with it. It also comes with these ridiculously small starfish and lotion bottles."
2,Grammy's analysis,This add on to the fountain falls set does not snap into place well and is continually coming apart from the other parts. It is frustrating for a child as well as their grandparent.
3,Daughter love I don't,"THIS IS A DUPLICATE OF THE REVIEW I WROTE FOR THE HOT TUB - I wrote a much longer review under the fountain. Just know that my daughter loves the set (we bought her all three pieces)but as the parent you should be aware that it is messy and unlike most polly sets, not a very good design. The three pieces do not fit well together, the tub needs to be rigged to drain into the fountain, and the upper drain does not work well. That being said, my daughter has had a blast playing with this. She plays in the kitchen (you want a very flat surface) while I do dishes, clean and cook. I am very pleased she likes it and I believe that is really what matters as long as you have time to mop up afterwards."
1,SPYWARE DOCTOR POS,I bought Spyware Doctor about a week ago. It will crash your computer do not buy!! The program uses up the computers cpu causing slowing and crashes. Theservice is called swdsvc.exe. Do not install this program!
4,good,"Ordered this cable for my camera. The one they sent me was defective and they quickly with no hassel refunded my money. For the price, very good quality"
3,Don't be misled by comparisons to Mahler,"Melartin's symphonies are often compared to Mahler's by critics simply because he introduced Mahler to the Nordic audience. But they are hardly Mahlerian at half of the length. In fact, they are typical miniaturist's symphonies, which vaguely reminded me of Sinding. Powerful and ambitious openings are drowned out by overflowing lyricism in the middle movements, which, despite their colorfulness, are sterile of ideas. No doubt there are many good tunes in the symphonies, but they are nondescript, easily fade from memory and soon become tiresome. Grieg, though his only symphony is often dismissed as derivative, seems the only miniaturist capable of large scale works."
4,Good for longer entries,"I was a also a bit dubious about the usability of this product. And living in the UK it meant I had to post it to my mate Rick in Philly, and he posted it on to me! Anyway, when it arrived I was pleased in all respects. The size is good, the built quality seems fine, the keys response was good (not too spongy - if that's a word), and the main thing the response time is immediate. I was worried that you would need to s-l-o-w down the typing speed in order to allow the software to keep up, but last night I was merrily typing in telephone numbers and never found I was going to fast. While its a bit of a clunky unit to use ALL the time, its fine to keep in your bag, and when the thought of typing a long e-mail using Graphiti (how DO you spell it?) seems a bit daunting, just plug this in, and away you go. The keys are a BIT small, but then we'd all moan it was too big if they made them bigger! Highly recommended."
3,Caution,"I find this type of products very usefull, I own a Palm m125, and since I didn't see a good reference picture of the product (the one presented shows only the front) unfortunatedly I purchase this article by mistake so be VERY CAREFUL when buying it, this product won't work with the m125"
4,Something to remember,"I have the model for a Palm VX, not this one, but I expect they work the same. One thing not mentioned in the manual, and which I never thought of either, was that if you have keyboard drivers installed, you have to disable those first to get it to work. Otherwise, they conflict and when you turn on your Palm, it goes right to HotSync and you can't get out of it. Knowing that ahead of time can save a lot of frustration.That said, between the Function button and the Command button, you can do almost anything with it."
3,Not stiff enough,"This spatula is very flexible. Sometimes when I am turning eggs and holding the spatula level, it bends and the egg slides right off."
3,Handle grip is not heat-resistant,"I have had this spatula for about three years. I use it two or three times a week for flipping eggs, burgers, or sandwiches on nonstick and stainless steel pans. I have not had the problems that other reviewers have had with the silicone cracking. I wash mine by hand, not in the dishwasher - I wonder if that makes a difference. The problem though is that the ""soft, comfortable, non-slip grip"" is not heat-resistant at all. Any time it touches the edge of a hot pan, even for a couple of seconds, it leaves an ugly melted scar on the grip. If they had spent a few pennies more to put a silicone grip on the handle instead of this soft, easily-melted plastic I would have given this five stars."
3,Plastic handle is a bummer; silicon eventually split,"Like other reviewers, the silicone on my spatula eventually split. It did take a few years to happen, and in fairness, that's really more a problem with the material than manufacturing.The handle isn't silicone, it's plastic, which is a bummer, because when you're using the spatula and if you forget and lie it down on the pan it melts. Yech."
2,I'll never trust the OXO brand again,"This spatula/flexible turner didn't last very long--less than a year. The very thin edge began to chip off, and I had to junk it or risk small particles of plastic in my food. I had confidence in the OXO name when I bought the thing, but that venerable brand name meant nothing when it came to almost daily use of this basic cooking tool in my kitchen. A spatula should last at least a couple of years, and this one didn't. As another reviewer pointed out, this spatula tapers to a very thin edge, all too prone to breaking off in small bits. Metal spatulas used to last for years, but coated pans have forced us to rely on these virtually disposable items--what a waste. We need a better mousetrap, or at least a more durable turning tool for use with non-stick cookware."
3,Works OK,"I bought the turner to use with cookies on non-stick pans, hoping to get similar results to a metal turner. It works okay, but not as well as a metal one with tender cookies."
2,Not good for flipping,I am disappointed with this product. I find it difficult to slide this as far underneath the food I am flipping as I need to. This results in a lot of food mishaps. I never use it now.
3,Handle Always Ends Up Melting,"I have purchased THREE of these!Why? Well because it's a normal/natural habit to rest it on the skillets edge. I love this item, but the manufacturer NEEDS to make the handle silicon too, so they don't burn up.I will now upload a pic of my third one I just ruined :("
2,Not in Title Decription,"I will always check the description for measurements from now on. This is a very small size style of the larger OXO silicone spatula sold everywhere. I have two large ones and needed another large one. The price was good, but I was shocked to see the mini spatula in the box when I opened it. I discovered later that Amazon advertises the larger one as ""large"" in the description title, but leaves out the word ""small"" for the smaller one in its description title. I feel deceived."
4,loved it but....,I loved this spatula but it somehow got left in the oven and the handle melted. The turner part was fine. Does anyone know what the handle is made out of? I don't think it's silicone.
2,Not a kitchen star performer,"Sure, this is a well made, solid tool that is plenty slippery and flexible but it seems too narrow for pancakes, sandwiches or burgers and a bit too wide for brownies. It will be fine for some cookies but it will not be my first choice out the drawer for anything because while this has an ""average width"", each food is not average in size."
1,It lasted 13 months and gouged/ruined a $60 pan,It says it can handle up to 600 F. In the 13 months I owned it I never left it sitting in a pan. I was using it last night and the silicone cracked and revealed the metal in the turner and gouged my $60 pan ruining it. Seriously? It lasted 13 months and was never abused. Avoid this product. Very disappointed.
3,"too big, too flimsy","It's not the fault of the turner, but I find myself avoiding using this for day to day cooking. It's fine for cookies, but I really wanted it for flipping eggs and such. It's too big and thick for maneuvering."
2,cracks after a couple months,"I bought this and in two months, the silicone had broken off of a corner and now off of the whole thing, allowing food to become trapped inside the spatula (creating risk for food borne illness) on top of the fact that it is now no longer scratch free."
2,Design flaw,"Silicone is great, I am trying to move all of my cooking utensils to this superior material. However this item has a fatal flaw that other reviewers have noted -- it will break on you.The silicone is coated around a metal core. The silicone is too thin, or the metal inside is too sharp, in any case as you use it and bend it over the course of a few months, the silicone will become cut at the edge of the metal, so when it is bent you can see the metal poking through at its front edge.My recommendation would be to look for a different silicone product, I see many good choices here on Amazon.Gave it an extra star as it is silicone and that is better than a plastic item, but based on the quality issues and the price, it doesn't get more than this."
4,The only spatula I use!,"I have actually owned one of these for about 3 years and just ordered another one through amazon. It is my preferred spatula for everything. It fits comfortably in your hand and allows for very nice control of anything your cooking. It's not too large, not too small. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because after about 2 years the silicone started to crack where the handle meets the flipper. I am very hard on my things so this is really no surprise and to be honest it has really not gotten worse since then (about a year). The spatula still continues to work but more flexibility at that location would have made it a very long-term item. I suspect, given my roughness on kitchen utensils, it should last about 5 years total before it won't be usable any longer. In that time it has and will be the best spatula I've ever owned. Highly recommended!"
4,like the shape and size but too short,"Longer would be nicer so that my hand is not so close to the heat. For some cooking that will stick, I still prefer to use wood/bamboo turner."
5,Very nice for fragile items.,I have a couple other spatulas for normal use but this one works great on fragile things prone to break or be very thin.
1,So far so good,"My nylon turner just melted and sticked to the bottom of my nonstick frying pan, it is so gross. I have to throw them away. I saw this at amazon and decide to give this a try and so far it is doing a good job and not melting away like the old one. It seems like a sturdy product and hold up to 500 degree without any problem.I have these for a few months and start noticing that all my food taste funny and have a strange smell and taste to my stir fry food. I finally find out it is from this spatula. I am throwing this away and not a good product if it give off strange smell and taste to foods. I will not recommend this to anyone."
2,Was great until the silicone fell apart,"Was happy with this spatula until the silicone began to fall apart (corner fell off while cooking) less than a year after purchasing, exposing the metal inside. Cannot recommend this product. Hopefully Oxo will release an upgrade with better materials."
3,"Stands up to heat, but not to wear",If you are vigorous with your stir fry's you will probably need a sturdier spatula. There is a layer of metal that is encased by the silicone and if you press down on the tip of the spatula while stir frying it can cause the silicone to easily tear and the metal to be exposed.
2,"Terrific for a few months, silicone is too thin.",We have all 3 sizes. The small and medium began to tear after a few months just where the tip tapers. These are metal coated with silicone. The design does not stand up after flexing so many uses and begins to split - exposing the metal inside to your nonstick surface. We loved these and are so disappointed. The largest omelet spatula is still going strong!
3,Love it but doesn't last,"Granted I love this smaller size spatula, but I go through one a year it seems. It's probably the most used kitchen tool in my house but over time, the metal becomes exposed and it's time to replace it."
5,"Excellent materials, but be sure about the size!","These Oxo appliances are excellent, and make cooking much simpler. However, bear in mind this particular model is the smaller one. They have another bigger model.They are both great for their independent purpuses, though."
4,Good spatula for non-stick cookware,I really hate those plastic spatulas that are stiff and curl over at the edge after little use. This spatula isn't like that. The stiffness is almost perfect so that it flexes easily to get under food in the pan but is stiff enough to lift food out of the pan. My only complaint is that the Silicone coating will split at the leading edge if the spatula is used to cut apart food in the pan such as when scrambling hamburger. It doesn't happen right away but it will happen if you're not careful. You can use it with the split but it doesn't seem very sanitary so I usually replace it at this point. This is definitely the best non-stick spatula I have ever used.
4,Works great,"I love the silicone surface of this turner because it doesn't scratch my pans. I use it pretty much every day for eggs, and it does a beautiful job and cleans up easily.Because it's meant to be flexible, it really isn't the best for jobs that require a very sturdy spatula. For most basic cooking tasks, it does just fine.I have been using this product for about 1 year, and it's in great shape after heavy use."
1,Junk,"The spatula warped upon the first use. I was cooking sausage over medium heat, and using the spatula to flip the sausage. This is exactly the kind of job that I need a spatula for, but this one is a piece of junk. One single use, and the spatula is no longer flat - it curves about 45 degrees away from the plane it should be on. This is my second bad experience with OXO, and there won't be a third."
2,Piece broke off,"Used this happily for 12 months or so, until attempting to turn crispy roasted potato pieces on a baking tray and the entire corner of the spatula broke off. It hadn't been damaged in any way before, but suddenly there was a piece of black silicone on my child's plate mixed in with the potatoes. I'd hoped it would be a robust kitchen tool, but clearly not."
4,Amazing,I used this product for so many different things. Several drops will keep your Tollett sparkling and disinfected. I recommend this product to people who are tired of using harsh chemicals and still want certain areas disinfected around the house.
3,belt review,"Belt was too small for our child, would recommend it for only children under 4. Our son liked it well enough if it had fit properly. Not much adjustment room."
2,The Science of Crime Scene Investigation,"Has a good overview of the science pertaining to crime scenes, university programs, and job availability within the career area. Not what I thought it was which was a scientific approach to crime scene investigation. I would buy it for an adolescent seeking information for a potential career. In fact, I am donating it to a high school library after I write this review."
1,Splatter?,"The author clearly does not know the subject. He can not even get the nomenclature correct when he starts to talk about ""blood splatter"". If you know anything about forensic science you know that it is not ""splatter"" it is spatter."
2,A casebook or just a good read,"I looked at the title and thought - Yes this looks great. Then I read the first sentence and came across ""blood splatter"". Not the correct terminology and an immediate let down. The correct ""technical"" term is ""blood spatter"".This may seem a small matter to some, but it immediately made me dubious to the authenticity of the rest of the material, and whether more of the content portrayed incorrect technical information.This book maybe a good read, but is not for someone who is looking for CORRECT procedure or technical insight."
4,Excellent Corvette History,"I bought this book to help me in my search for a car to buy. It was useful in that regard, but it is also a very interesting history of an iconic automobile. My research interest was in the fifth generation of the Corvette (the C5) since that is the model I was interested in buying. The chapters on the other models were very informative and entertaining. I enjoy reading history, especially automotive history, and this book fit the bill for the Corvette. It is a little short on raw data, but I don't think that was the intent of the author in the first place. All in all, a good buy."
5,Excellent source for corvette collectors,If you are a corvette collector and want to really understand how the car has changed over the years this is a great source of info and pictures.
3,Not too bad but I found something better!!!,"These books are ok, but if you want to take the hasle out of planning the night & do it all for less than doing it yourself just go to Armcandygirls.com they planned it all, we didnt have to negotiate or stand in lines, they did it all, for less than if we planned it all out ourselves ,just tell em what you want to do and they take care of it all and it was hastle free..check them out and use the money you would have paid for this book on tips for the strippers..."
1,0 for 2,"I bought one of these chargers. It broke within a couple of days. So being loyal to palm I bought another... which never worked! I have a ton of palm stuff and I havent written anything bad about the company, but I found that workmanship to be much lower then what I would expect from such an established company."
5,The only way to fly in the winter!!,"I love the Raydiowarm, this thing really gets the job done in keeping wind off of your hands, which keeps the thumbs nimble for precision and 3D flying. It feels a lot like using a radio tray, so if you are a thumber using a neckstrap, there will be a little adjustment getting used to having the radio further away from your body, instead of directly in front of your nose, but it's far easier to fly that way with warm thumbs, than the usual way with thumbs frozen stiff. Stuff a few hand warmers in there, and it is game on."
3,A+ Certification Sixth Edition,Received book within a week. The book was actually not what I wanted. Because I was looking for a sixth edition and I received a fifth edition. Also the book was bent and looked on the old side.
2,Book Was Over My Head........,"I'm a software trainer who wants to become certified as a PC technician. The author claims that this book will be able to teach the novice (non-PC technician) everything he/she needs to know to pass the A+ certification exams. That's a joke.The first few chapters start out fine, and seem to provide explanations that are thorough and clear enough for the novice. But then at some point (right around chapter 6), the author forgets who his audience is and seems to assume we're all working as PC technicians already. His explanations start to get more more vague, and he uses more and more tech jargon and inside jokes that only a tech would get. It's obvious who he's really writing for."
4,This is The Best Book on the Subject,This is by far the best book on A+ certification I've used. The explanations are clear. The topics are well organized and the chapter cuestions are on the button. I now work as a PC Tech and still use the book as a reference.
2,Good for class and labs. Not good for new A+ Tests.,"This book came out in OCTOBER 2003. The new comptia A+ exams came out November 26th, 2003. Although this is the premier book for class room study, it does not focus on the new exam questions or related detail. Five stars for class room study. 1 star for real exam focus study. This book should be called Computer Basics 101, not A+ Certification. It's a marketing gimmick."
1,Good luck with Amazon,"The book is great... I gave a bad review b/c of amazons way of charging me 6 dollars to read the book online when I never saw any print about that... I didn't want to pay for that, and there is no way they going to let me get out of paying it. I would recomend this boook to any one intersted in A+ certification, however buy the book from anyone outside of amazon."
4,All you need for the A+ exam.......maybe,This book was great. I used this book along with an older boook based on the 2001 objectives and passed the exam. The 2003 objectives are covered in this book. If you know the basics about hardware and OS then get this book......it will get you through the A+. Did have a few typos hence the four stars.
4,Very good book but it may not help you to pass the exam,"I just passed my A+ exam. I used this book as my primary reading tool. I want to say that if I don't have enough background, I may not pass this test. A lot of questions in A+ does not cover in this book. I feels that this book will not help you to pass the exam but it will enchance your technical skills in the future. I hope this book can have better presentation. like, if the author can use a (whole page) to lay out all the differences of cup , irq, dma and Ram or windows specification, common use troubleshooting utility that will help."
4,All I needed to pass the exam!,"This book got me through the exam quite well. I had not even been employed as a tech, but only building and fixing PC's as a hobby when I decided to work toward certification. I spent a month reading this book and taking notes and passed the exam no problem. I struggled a bit with the old network technology questions (pre-ethernet stuff) but I don't believe it was a lack of info in the book, but rather my laziness in studying."
5,Buy This...Don't listen to others,"The author writes very well about subject matter that is inherently confusing and highly technical. He manages to guide you through how most important aspects of computer hardware / OS work. He does so in a clear and easy-to-understand method.This book is the one book I would suggest to any person who wants to know more about computers and is considering IT as a career. IT starts with A+ (lame pun intended).Forget the long winded reviews that say bad things about this book. If you can read, and you have even the slightest bit of a technical aptitude, then you will have no problem passing the test using this book. Just make sure you get the latest addition.Well done Mr. Meyers."
4,THe Only Book You'll Need......maybe,This book covers everything you need for the A+ exam based on the 2003 objectives. I studied for the exam using an older book based on the 2001 objectives and this one. I passed no problems both hardware and OS. If you have basic working knowledge of both hardware and OS get this book and it will get you through the A+. Were a few typos (hence the 4 stars)but nobody's perfect i guess.
2,What a disappointment!!!,"I gave this book two stars out of sympathy, and the fact that a couple of subjects got decent coverage. I'm not sure Mr. Meyers even read the 2003 objectives before revising one of his earlier editions. This book is outdated, and according to my PC hardware professor at the school I attend, it's also got a lot of mistakes. Get ""The Complete Guide to A+ Certification"" by Michael Graves instead. It's a better book with better coverage, and at least Graves knows how to write."
2,"Covers hardware exam well, but lacks proper coverageofOSexam","This book provides a good coverage of the A+ Core Hardware exam with about 80 percent of the questions on the Core Hardware covered in some part of this book. However this book does not provide as good of a coverage of the Operating Systems exam. A lot of questions that came up on the OS exam were not mentioned anywhere in this book.The practice exams included with this book are fairly basic. About 80 percent of the questions on the Core Hardware practice exams with this book were covered on the Core Hardware exam. Only 50 percent of the questions on the OS practice exams were covered in the OS exam.This book also needs to be better organised around the A+ objectives.Overall, this book covers the Core Hardware exam very well but the OS section of this book needs quite a bit of improvement."
3,A+ Cert All-In-One Exam Guide,"Not too bad... Mike Myers is irritating on video. Don't expect too much ""real world"" scenarios. Really enjoyed the Chapter on Hard Drives."
4,A+ Study,This book is thick with extra information to get the whole conceptual idea of the topics. Very good. I've yet to take the A+ exam yet.
5,Mike Meyers is the only choice in computer knowledge,"With the ever changing computers, this book is valuable in learning what is expected as a computer technician."
3,"Well written, starts better then it ends","The characters are interesting, especially how they react to each other. The writing is good, it grabs the reader, and brings them deep into an inovative universe. However, many of the major plot twists were either expected, or lacked the impact they shoudl of had. This book pulled me in strongly, and then failed to live up to that potential. Don't get me wrong, it was still a enjoyable read. I think I'm mostly disappointed because the book had such potential, and never capitalized on it. I'll definitely pick up more by the author."
4,A Good Book -- No Fooling,"FOOL'S WAR is one of the best scifi books I've read in the last couple of years. No humans with far-fetched mental powers. No apocalyptic ending. Just a good, fast-paced story with some engaging (and generally believable) characters and a plot that keeps you guessing. Not all the plot twists were entirely unforeseen, but there were enough surprises to keep it interesting. Also, the technology was mostly plausible and understandable for the casual (scientifically challenged?) reader. The book is a little hard to get into at first, but this is true of many books. It can be unclear at first how seemingly unconnected people and events relate to each other. A little patience is well worth the effort with FOOL'S WAR.I had never read anything by Zettel before, but this book kept appearing in my ""recommendations"" from Amazon, so I gave it a try. I'm definitely not sorry. Kudos to Amazon and I'll be reading more of Ms. Zettel's work in the future."
2,Nuthin' spectacular.,"Is it just me, people? I can't relate to what I call ""chick-fiction."" Take a female sci-fi author and you're gonna get all this relationship crap. Oh, gee, I like him, but I think he's p***ed at me--just look at the way he ""jams his fists into his pockets"", and besides, I'm an artificial intelligence anyway, and... Ye-gads! I think Ursula Le Guin exemplifies this--check out The Dispossessed.So, here you've got female relationship mumbo-jumbo which is already sending all the guys heading for the hills, and now on top of it all we've got all this Islamic gobbley-gook to deal with. Yeah, I can really relate to this book, Sarah! Sheesh!The only redeeming factor was the cyber-punkish net-travel. Other than that--this book is to guys what kryptonite is to Superman... emasculating."
5,Great story,"One of the more unusual and interesting SF novels I have read recently. Although I agree with some of the other reviewers about weaknesses in the characterization of male characters and less than perfect descriptive skills, the interesting cultural background and plot still make it a very enjoyable read.Something I did not understand was the reference to Neuromancer (another SF title I like very much) in one of the commentaries - apart from both books including characters zooming around in cyberspace, the background and mood of the books could hardly be more different, Neuromancer being much more high-tech oriented.In my view definitely superior to ""Reclamation"", also by Sarah Zettel."
3,OK sf with some dodgy premises,"""Fools War"" is OK sf. A cast of women characters occupy the key roles in this story about a tramp freighter of the starways which inadvertantly gets involved in smuggling and AI rights.There are no new real ideas in this story. The tech is a little dodgy, and the background culture is a bit thin. For example, the idea of physically transporting data in a starship's hold when there are faster-than-light communications reminds me of ""coals to Newcastle"". In addition making the ship's captain a devoted, Islamic women strikes me as a bit far fetched.I rate it an OK read, but nothing exceptional."
2,A perfectly generic book,"As noted by some of the reviewers above, this book does not explore new ideas. The Minds of Iain Bank's Culture could use these AIs as sofa cushions.The characters are taken from the Michael Crichton school of generic action figures -- one label serves as an entire personality for the entire book.I have no idea why this book got good reviews. Probably for the same reason Michael Crichton does."
2,What's the big deal?,"""Fool's War"" follows the recipe for a mediocre book perfectly. It mixes a sloppily thought out premise with stereotyped characters and below-average writing. Here's one way to make reading this book more enjoyable: try and count how many times characters ""take the stairs two at a time."" The plot seems as if it were cobbled together out of Star Trek episodes; every twist revolves around revealing another convenient property of their technology. The characters are completely undeveloped; they bicker because of the ""dark secrets"" in their past until they suddenly decide they have a crush on someone.Why is everyone so excited about this book"
4,Demon Seed,"The Novel ""Demon Seed"" by Dean Koontz it was a very good book. It told alot of interesting details it told alot about the girl and her live with the home security. The way that the person in the security talked to her. The other reason was that she could talk to it and it could understand her and what she told it to do. It was neat how the computer could see her and everything that she did and it knew all about her. What she liked and what she woreit was a unsalf world so thats why she has a home security system. The book was good everyone should read it."
5,Producer,"Determined Zionists--Jews and non-Jews alike--travel to Jerusalem to demonstrate their solidarity with the brave people of Israel. In addition to meeting with prominent Israeli leaders, such as then Mayor of Jerusalem Ehud Omert and Natan Saransky, these devout Zionists have the sobering opportunity to hear from regular Israeli citizens who have suffered directly at the hands of the despicable terrorists intent on driving every Jew in Israel into the sea. This short film brings to its viewer the same unfiltered message of strength and courage the Rally in Israel participants received during their trip."
1,Don't Buy or Buy Larger!,"Before buying I checked tire sizes, then went to the ""fitment guide"" to look up the correct size. When I tried to install the chains they did not fit! The closing lever/ hook barely reached the first link in the chain and no matter how and with what tools I tried I was unable to close it -- no twisted links or cross chains either, to account for the problem. I ended up taking some odd generic chain I had, cutting open a link and, after attaching it to the tire chain, welding it shut. With the added link the product works although it's still mighty snug. Granted, the tires are brand new and therefore a tad larger than the average for this size but the sizing chart should certainly allow for that. Good thing I can weld or we'd still be stuck up here in the Blue Ridge."
3,Worked good until it worked!,"This was our first time buying snow-chains. We were going skiing and we expected it to snow! It worked great for the first few times we used it, and then the hook that keeps it together, twisted! A mechanic was able to fix it for no charge. But we couldn't use it until it was fixed. Its been 3yr since we bought it, but its still in great shape. We wash and dry it after each use and for storing."
1,Broke Early On,"I bough two pair of these chains thinking I would put them on all four tires. They were a very tight fit, but after getting every row and link lined up with lots of wiggles and adjustments they just fit. It was so much work I opted for one set on the back tires. I drove my truck an 1/8 of a mile about four times on dirt roads packed with snow and ice and they broke. I double checked directions and suggestions, and made sure my sizing was right, and tried the second pair. Again, tight fit but got them on after a lot of wiggling. These broke after only two trips 1/8 mile on snow. Bummer. Reluctantly returning both pairs."
1,Did not fit.,I ordered the chains that were specified for my tire size. The manufacturer's packaging also listed my tire size. They did not fit my tire size.
2,Incomplete sale,"Ordered these chains along with the tensioner. Chains were delivered in a timely manner. Weeks later, a note came saying they would be unable to ship the tensioner as they were out....period! Chains don't work without the tensioner guys......!"
4,recommended by our marriage counselor,"Haven't yet read it, but it was the only book recommended by our marriage counselor specialized in relationship enhancement."
3,Depends on what you are looking for,"If you want to read a book that is anti-government and anti-corporate using a little humour, this book is for you. If you want a lot of humour, forget it."
4,Excellent peeler,"I bought this peeler as a replacement for another one of the same model I bought several (~5) years ago. (It was finally getting dull from its hundreds of trips through the dishwasher.) I really like these peelers: they are easy to handle and sharp. At the same time, I feel safer with it than I did with my mom's old dull one. Additionally, I prefer this form factor to the other style with the blade that goes across; this is much more comfortable. My only dislike is that it doesn't have a tool for removing potato eyes, but that's a minor nit."
5,Peels thru anything!,"Excellent product, great quality, peels everything! Dishwasher safe and doesn't slip out of your hands."
2,Gandy,The Trudeaux peeler is satisfactory for peeling. The handle is a bit large for my hand and there is no pointy end for digging out the potatoe eyes.
4,Good start and reference,"Read and familiarized myself with the book on the plane to Rome. By the time I got there, I was able to greet people politely, ask directions, order food and get the check among other important things. Being that the book was on my Droid, I was able to search words and quickly jump to the Table of Contents etc. That was a great help. The only drawback was that the book has a limited vocabulary list, so sometimes I was unable to find a word that I needed, when I needed it. But overall, I definitely had a leg up on the people I was traveling with and it was a great resource to get started!"
5,This Dummy loves this book!,"Book is very well organized with excellent pronunciation tips. The ""proof will be in the pudding"" when I travel to Italy in a few months, but I'll have command of some important phrases and a basic vocabulary so hopefully won't come off as an ""Ugly American."""
5,Great Review of Useful Phrases,I have lived in Italy in the distant past and studied Italian in the not as distant past. But it all atrophies when I don't use it. This little book which I have on my iPad brings me back to a level of confidence in communicating in Italy. I read it on the plane ride over.
5,insightful introduction to science fiction for neophytes,"whether you want to read it or write it, this is a terrific introductory course in science fiction by our finest living sf author."
3,nylon Pants,"I'm a 36"" waist and I ordered these in XL, they run small, I would have ordered them in XXL but they do not offer them in that size."
3,Pant Size,"The quality of this product was outstanding; however, the size didn't seem quite right. I've worn Large 36-38 waiste for years in every pair of pants I've owned. I ordered Large 36-38 in the Defender Nylon Pants, but they are way too tight. They fit more like a Medium 33-34.Defender Nylon Pants From Holloway Sportswear"
4,Great for Fall outdoor exercise,"I wore these pants during a Fall bike ride, on a windy day. My goal was to stay warm. They did their job!"
4,"Good book, hope they update it soon.","This book was probably just right when it was released, but it's time to update it for 2000/XP and drop NT entirely. I only looked at the 2000 stuff, since those are the kind I support, but the info was very helpful, and even though we're several service packs down the road, it's still accurate. I didn't read the NT information (though it's largely the same, since they have the same roots) for accuracy as much, but it's still worth the price for the 2000 answers."
3,"Cute, but not thigh high.","They seem like decent quality, but are just knee high stockings.You would have to be like 4 feet tall for them to be thigh high."
4,These r so soft. ^_^,There is not much I can say for these thigh highs thy r soft and look great only thing is thy do tend to run pretty easily.So u have to be really careful when wearing them but other than that thy r the best colored thigh highs out there I think.
4,"Sexy, but they don't stay up very well","My wife got these in combination with a very sexy school girl costume. She looked great in these, but did complain about having to frequently pull them up. The length appeared to be perfect, went to mid-thigh. To put it into perspective, she is 5'7"" with relatively long legs. Overall, she likes them."
2,one size does not fit all!!,I did not like the pink tights beause they did not fit to well!so if you are slighty biger then super skiny people don't buy this it will no fit!
4,Good quality,These are really nice truly opaque white stockings. They will look great with the costume I plan to wear them with. Very good quality with high lycra content so they will fit well and last long.
3,Okay for the money,"There kind of thick, a little itchy, and not nearly long enough to come to my thighs, the price was great... But I think I will go with a little high priced ones next time."
3,great!,I got this for an Alice and Wonderland costume I wore last October- They served their function perfectly-- but they aren't the kind of thigh highs to wear for daily heavy duty use- one snag and FINITO!
5,Love them!,Got these a while ago and didn't have a reason to wear them until last night. I wore them with jeans and was VRY surprised that they didn't budge a bit!! Great pair of tights! Now that I know they stay up so good I am really excited to wear them with a skirt!
1,Not as pictured,"I was looking for opaque stockings--these are translucent nylons. Flimsy and cheap, not worth the five bucks (or the wait--they came a week after the expected delivery period ended)."
3,"Good, but a little long","The product was good - they were white stockings like I expected. But they were a little long. I wore them with a short skirt and they looked like I was wearing pantyhose. They went all the way up my legs, even though they are supposed to be thigh-highs. And I'm 5'8"" with long legs. Served their purpose very well, though - received them in time and the price was cheap."
1,HORRIBLE,"these stockings are ridiculously cheap. when you get them in the package they come with a piece of cardboard in them...they snagged as soon as i pulled that piece out! i put them on so i could see how bad the snag was. it was pretty bad, not that it mattered because the stockings were way to long to wear anyways (im 5'6 with LONG LEGS). i pulled them all the way to my butt, and they still needed to go up higher. it looked like i had nasty loose floppy skin on my legs, ESPECIALLY around my ankles. i threw them away and went to the store to get a different brand of stockings. i would NOT recommend this at all."
2,too tight,i'm 5-2 115lbs and the tops of these gave me muffin top on my thighs. If you're wearing a garter you don't need them that tight.
2,Stockings,"Ok there was a day delay on these stockings. They were a bit long, i was wearing a skirt and tried them on and my skirt covered it. I was hoping it would just go to my knees or a bit higher like shown in the picture. The picture of the stockings didn't show that they are see-through. When i got them they were see-through which i didn't want at all. If it wasn't see-through and long i would of love it. If it helps, i'm 5'2. Hope this review helps!"
4,Rewards repeat listens,Bought this at a gig in London. He was excellent live and at first I wasn't sure about the cd. But by the second listen I loved it with Jamie Cullum like swing on Small day tomorrow and On A Summer Night is a lazy bossa nova with a pretty melody. Very jazzy. Nice late night atmosphere and he has a sexy voice. Definitely recommended.
5,A jolt of self awareness,"This book reminds us that every word we think, speak or write springs from an intention deep within us. We are free to choose to be aware of the power that our thinking has in creating our lives. Mr. Johnston gives the reader many insights concerning the intent hidden in words we commonly use and demonstrates how we can change our lives by changing our language."
4,GANSTA B$#!H,"THIS IS SOME GOOD STUFF RIGHT HERE,WITH ENUF GUEST APPEARANCES FROM BIG TONE....LOOK OUT 4 THIS CHICK TO BLOW"
4,So rich!!!,"This books gives a glimpse into the world of the dog-eat-dog world of mega rich. Some characters can be sophisticated, likable and kind one moment and a master villain the next. This books is un-pun-downable!! Loved it."
4,"A ""Can't Put Down Book""",War andPeace and Crime and Punishment-10-hence the reason for the -8-rating. Mr Dunne understands these people and their motivations. He did an excellent job in character delineation! Ruth Roberts
5,A HAUNTING STORY,"I LOVE DOMINICK DUNNE'S STORIES AND THIS ONE HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE FOR YEARS. I BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY SISTER (WHO WAS NOT A D.D. FAN) BUT FOUND SHE LOVED THE PACE OF HIS WRITING, ETC."
2,Not as good as the true story,"This book is a fictionalized version of the true story of Vicki Morgan, Alfred Bloomingdales' mistress. The true story, ""Beautiful Bad Girl,"" is far more engaging and has the ring of truth to it. If tales of the rich and powerful are what you are looking for, why read the watered down version.Beautiful Bad Girl: The Vicki Morgan Story"
2,Stopped halfway through,"** There's a semi-spoiler in this review. **This was my first Dominick Dunne book. I was immediately fascinated with the characters and settings, so I ate it up until I got halfway through. At that point, one of the main characters spun out of control in a ridiculously cartoonish, implausible way. The character lost my sympathy, so I closed the book and gave it to someone else because there was no one left in the story for me to root for."
1,"Very, Very Bad Writing","I could barely get through the book due to the very irritating and smug writing style. The overuse of phrases such as ""I heard with my own ears"" and ""I saw with my own eyes"" made me want to barf. Once you've read anything by Dominick Dunne (including articles in Vanity Fair with all of his very knowledgeable ""unnamed sources"")you know his writing style and the questionable validity of its content. This is of course non-fiction but so over the top and full of self-importance that if it had been written by an unknown author it would never have been accepted for publication. Garbage."
1,"Awful, don't bother",This book was a complete waste of time. The story is boring and you don't care what happens to the characters.
4,excellent,An excellent piece of history with captivating stories from those who can tell them best....the heroes of that time.
5,Movies on the Fantail,Helen Grenga presents her brother James' diaries and his shipmates' notes and memoirs with such eloquence that the reader lives in combat with the citizen sailors of the USS Barr as they contributed heroically to our victories in the Pacific in 1944 and 1945.
4,A great addition to any album list,"I'm really enjoying this first album from Norton. It's a great anytime, anyplace CD. My spectrum stays pretty close to Staind, Tool, Evanescence and the like, but I really appreciate and enjoy eccentric folks in the same vein as Beck, Johnny Cash, and Bob Dylan. That's why this is a great album, because Norton works his unique voice and style into each genre and it fits perfectly there. Nice work, sir.Another nice feature is having something I can pop into the home CD player and the whole family can enjoy.Favorite tracks so far are the more rock-laden, ""January Comes Down Hard"", and ""Ode to a Leader""."
5,Gets better and better,I've been a fan of Lester's work since the (in?)famous Teddy Bear Picnic Concert. Lester's a great artist and continues to grow with his latest work. I listen to it over and over at work and it always puts me in a better mood.Buy this CD immediately.No...sooner than that.
4,A Look at On-The-Job Training,"""President Kennedy"" examines the subject's life during his White House years. At times it literally covers John F. Kennedy's life on an hour-by-hour, meeting-by-meeting basis as the president and his staff try to figure out how to run the country and influence world events.This is one of the most interesting and scary biographies I have ever read. Interesting because the reader gets a glimpse of the inner workings of a president's decision-making process. Scary because apparently Kennedy was learning on the job and seemed poised to use nuclear weapons on several occasions.This is a very readable biography that gives a good view of the politics of the time."
1,Bumblebee- broken,I bought two of these Delux Bumblebee Autobots and BOTH were defective. The first stage of transformation which is engaged by pushing a button on the hood did not function on either transformer. A piece of plastic in each was either stuck or broken off. I have had several other adults look at the transformer and the conclusions were the same.
3,Classic Bumblebee Camaro,"As another review indicated, as soon as I opened up the package and tried the first step in transforming, it would not work. You have to press a small button that pops open the front end, which did not work. Then after finally getting it transformered, when we went to put it back together, the front end does not snap back into place so now it always has a droopy nose.... Seller was willing to take a return but could not locate the instructions on how it goes together, so now we have to keep it."
2,dissapointing :(,"This transformers toy is horrible! It looks ok in robot mode but looks like cow dung in vehicle mode. In robot mode it falls apart too easily and in car mode, the car has no bottom! It is very frusterating trying to put it together. I was lucky because I got it for $10, but now its $50!!! It is a pethetic exuse for a childs toy. You can't get a good movie transformer. If you want a good transformer, get a 25th anniversery g1 transformer.Transformers Universe GI Series Optimus Prime 25th Anniversary Pack with DVD"
2,picture is decieving,The toy is made of plastic and is made to look like metal in the picture. It is also a lot smaller than it appears in the picture and no size or dimension is listed on the info page
5,Great stuff,"Heard some of this on the radio at 2AM. Didn't have any in my music collection so decided to take a chance on this collection. I was worried it might not have aged well but it did. Stuff sounds as up to date now as it did as it was out front back in the days it was released. Not a bad cut in the collection. Besides being the funk collection to have, the guitars are as hard as any in rock. Certainly Hendrix influenced. The only issue is that no real listing of musicans on each cut. STILL above 5 stars for the music."
4,"Where is ""Super Stupid""???","Great band. Everyone should hear them, and this collection would make a perfect introduction/overview, except for one glaring omission: the hair-raising, blood-pumping guitar freakout ""Super Stupid"" from the Maggot Brain album. That track is surely one of Funkadelic's best (it's my personal favorite) and any so called ""Ultimate Compilation"" that fails to include this song is not an ultimate collection. Hard to believe they overlooked it. What would otherwise get a top rating loses a star."
2,Twelve steps are twelve steps,"I wasn't too impressed with this book. If you know your 12 steps, they are part of your whole life, this book didn't add much to me. I bought it to perhaps do a ""Bible"" type study, but just stick to the regular 12. If you are a Christian, it all folds together anyway."
5,Book / DVD Review,Great product - Well worth the price - Has helped me understand addiction and the recovery process.
3,Weakest Tiger Army album,"I've been a fan of Tiger Army for years and have thought each album improved upon the last--up until this one. Where as GHOST TIGERS RISE expanded upon their psychobilly sound, this album makes some truly unfortunate missteps, particularly with the new wave inspired ""As the Cold Rain Falls,"" which is not only a lousy song but removes all of the band's distinctive sound. One sure way to alienate a psychobilly fan is to drop the stand-up bass and instead use synthesizers. This would seem to be a stab at commercialism except for the fact that it followed by an all Spanish-language, Latin-flavored song, ""Hechizo de Amor,"" which is pretty much the opposite of the bad New Order imitation that preceded it. Puzzling.There are still some fine songs here--Nick 13 has always had an impressive voice--but the production is overly slick, and the stylistic changes often feel contrived."
2,What happened?,"I've been a huge fan of this band since their first self titled disc and I have to say this is Tiger Army at it's worst. The energy is lacking and some of the songs are just terible. The songwriting on some of these tracks would embarass a third grader. On one cut, they even sound like ""A Flock of Seagulls."" I don't think every disc should sound the same, but it's the lack of energy that disappoints, as well as the songs themselves. Hopefully, the next disc will be better."
4,"Lucid, for the non-economist","An amazingly lucid study of the Great Depression. Pitched squarely to the non-economist. Greenfield strives to make the Depression explicable, primarily on the basis of decisions made by governments (mostly the US) concerning monetary policy. Most of these decisions revolved around wrongly constraining the money supply at the worst possible time.Nothing here is markedly different from conventional consensus explanations of the Depression. The value of this book is in its simplicity of expounding key ideas."
3,"Great Price, Product So So",I subscribe for this product for the savings however somehow the taste is not the same from when I order directly from the manufacturer or from another seller. I feel a little bit leary about ordering again.
5,LOVE IT!,"This drink is so delicious, I could drink it many times a day (but I refrain).I believe it to be the highest quality and it is undenatured. Comes from Canada. I wish Amazon would offer it with free shipping."
3,"Good quality protein, but flavor mediocre","Tried the vanilla whey powder when it was on sale. I usually get Jay Robb cross-microfiltration whey, but this one was similar in composition (same type of protein, both use stevia to sweeten) but the flavor is vastly inferior.For me it is worth the extra money for a protein powder that tastes really good - so I am going back to Jay Robb."
4,"Natural Factors Whey Factors, Whey Protein","Works well, but there is a lot of dead space in the container when you first open it up. The container comes 3/4 - 4/5 full and the rest in empty space."
5,Love this product!!,Love this product. I sometimes mix it with almond milk and other times must plain water.....I have the Strawberry flavor and it is really good....also purchased a container with a mixer ball and that works super for mixing the whey. I use this for breakfast and I am not hungry until sometimes 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon!! Will order this product again and again.....
1,French Vanilla is gross,This stuff tasted disgusting. Weird. Maybe i got a bad batch? Who knows. The chocolate one is very good though.
2,Dirty & broken.,"I recieve this yesterday, the package was wrap in tape, Took off the tape , took off the cap, Yuck brown spots all over the spray area, don't even know where the brown came from, didn't want to even touch it, had to put on splactic gloves just to see if the spray works, which it didn't, !!! Had to wash the bottle and then kept messing with the it, just to try to get some of it out. this was a joke, Your better off to but the diffence in the store and get one that really works...."
3,levil heddid,"3 STARS FOR GOOD INTENTIONS AND ORIGINALITY. BUT IF YOU DONT LIKE THIS TRIBUTE CHECK OUT ""Look at All the Love We Found: A Tribute to Sublime"". CONTAINS COVERS BY PENNYWISE, FISHBONE, NO DOUBT, SPEARHEAD, JACK JOHNSON, G LOVE, LOS LOBOS, OZOMATLI, AND FILIBUSTER."
1,"Waste of money, waste of time...","I wasted $20 bucks on this CD. I put it in and it blew me away--in a bad way. The voices are terrible and they butcher the lyrics and add bizzare words like ""shoo-ahh"" and you can barely tell that it is even a Sublime cover. It is awful. It is like being trapped in the elevator of hell. Don't buy this."
1,Not what I expected,"It says ""various artists"" ..you know, I thought it might be fellow groups like No Doubt & Long beach dub all stars singing songs by Sublime, but noooo...this is JAZZ music!!! I was so mad ..the beats aren't even like sublime's. it was a waste of money and I wouldn't suggest buying this cd."
5,Love Love Love It!!!!,I first did this Video on Comcast On Demand. I was able to get it from Amazon cheaper then buying from the place Comcast suggested. I really enjoy doing this video. Its set at a great pace. You can feel the burn but it doesn't kill you. Lauren's moves and side comments are hysterical. I give it 5 stars! :)
1,A Travesty,"This was an absolute travesty. This modern production of Shakespeare's Othello was awful and didn't even follow they story line. Sacrilege! The names were replaced with pathetic alternetives: Iago - Ben Jago, Othello - John Othello, Cassio - Micheal Cass, Emilia - Lulu? Lulu? haha where did that one come from. There were some stronger points to this, some of the black and white symbolism from the original was there but overall a complete disappoinment."
4,"Amazingly enough, it works","Not merely a recasting (like Ethan Hawke's HAMLET) of a Shakespeare play into a modern setting, this is a translation of the story into a contemporary police station, so that the themes of racial strife and sexual jealousy are even more palpable. Andrew Davies (who supposedly wants to do this with all the Shakespeare plays) dispenses with the Shakespearean language, but keeps the characterizations and some of the stylistic elements intact. Eamonn Walker is a quiet, thoughtful Othello, while Christopher Eccleston, as an Iago with a motive, is chillingly malevolent in a riveting performance that stops just shy of scenery-chewing. It sounds like it should be awful, but it's not. Definitely worth a look, and certainly a good companion piece to the Laurence Fishburne OTHELLO for a high school English class."
1,Very dangerous - missing a lot,"Maybe it's because the exam has changed since this book was written. But this book is very dangerous.If you took the CISSP exam and could refer to this book in the exam - but it was your only source - you would flunk the exam. It flat-out does not cover areas of knowledge that the exam asks questions on. (And also covers a number of areas that the exam never touches on.)The danger is if the book was your main basis for the exam, you will walk in to the exam totally unprepared. (I can't give specifics because you sign a confientiality agreement when taking the exam.)My suggestion for taking the CISSP exam; 1) Exam prep alone won't do it - you need to be an experienced security professional to take this test (that's what saved my a**). 2) Get a prep book that was written recently (I am assuming the problem with this book is that the areas being tested has changed).And good luck with the test."
3,Good book to create a knowledge foundation,"This book is older and I think it is a little outdated for current CISSP exam. That being said if you don't use this book as your sole source of CISSP studying , it is a great book. I found this book very informative for the very basics of the of security. Mike Meyers' Certification Passport CISSP is a great starting point to build your knowledge foundation. I would recommend The CISSP Prep Guide: Gold Edition."
1,The colapse of Zimbabwe's economy,"The total collapse of the economy is totally the fault of the ruling party Zanu PF.The spending by the rulers of taxpayers money is well known and it has all to do with power and the thinking that all the land and its people belongs to Zanu PF. They should have left at least a decade ago for new ideas and new leaders, who in turn also should stepdown when their time is up.The tragedy of Zimbabwe is a following up story of Africa.Hopefully South Africa will not go down the same road.Be carefull of too much power and power crazy leaders.Any country that demands that the photo of the leader should be displace in every shop, restaurant or railway station is heading to total power."
2,Horrible,I can't believe I even bought this thing. It is small but the reel isn't- so it serves no purpose having the pole small- my son is going to lose the reel. It is flimsy and cheap.
1,lame,"Cool idea. I got one shipped straight from from China. It doesn't cast only works like a winch. you can reel it and unreel it but not cast due to the fact that it is ""fixed"" to the gears and not free spinning. Would make a great novelty gift since it does look like a big pen. But, IMO, not worth $5"
1,Save your money,Rod snapped in half the first time I used it. Save your money and buy a slightly larger telescoping rod.
3,For my son,I purchased this pole for my son and he really likes it. Make sure that you are catching small fish so the pole won't break. [...]
2,humm ok small but well could be better,as it states it is amazingly small..myself ive modded a reel to work with it..like other reviews said this works like a wench for the flipping technique..not for me ..i bought this for a survuval kit..this is going to sit in the closet until massive diasaster happens..this is life line for catching fish to eat..like i said the reel sucks for casting ..it cant be done normally you have to let the line out and try to flip it..so grind your reels down if they can fit and it will work perfect for casting..this has nothing to do with the seller in fact i got mine 2 days after by mail..which is amazing..best shipper i ever had on amazon..if you want a small fishing rod like this look for the new series they all work fine and are much better quality and will cast normally..
4,Next Step for Zalman King,"The writer, director and producer of Red Shoe Diaries created this new series as the next step in his career. This has more nudity and sex related comintary. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I was hoping for more interaction between the two main characters. But all in all it was well done. Definitly not disappointing for those who like Red Shoes"
2,"Very, very bad. Wow, so bad. My goodness.","This DVD contains what is actually the first episode, a film, of a television show done for a cable channel. It is not very good.The way it was filmed looks dated now - very 1990's, lots of jump shots and faux-music-video scenes. The plot is odd and unrealistic (and not particulary interesting.) There is a lot of nudity, but it's not particularly appealing.I believe this film is supposed to be erotic. The filmmaker was not successful.I got this to see one particular actor who is in it. Not worth my time, even for that. Terrible, terrible. And worse, BORING.I gave it two stars, rather than one, because it does at least have a plot. And the locations are quite nice."
5,Awesome,"I've been into Jim Starlin's work lately and purchasing Infinity Gauntlet, War, Crusade and alot of others. This one just adds to the collection and it is such a great read, interesting, and good to own. It is pricy but I work hard for my money so I bought it anyway and I love it. Jim Starlin is da man!"
1,"Hey Marvel, Put This Excellent TPB Back in Print!",This is a great story & I agree 100% with the previous review.What I do not agree with is the inflated price of this Trade Paperback Reprint on the secondary market. Such a shame... No wonder the comic book industry is struggling.
1,Visit Nanjing and then decide,"I visited Nanjing last year and toured the massacre museum. I challenge anyone to view the materials there and deny what the Japanese army did to the population of Nanjing in 1937-1938.If you are in doubt, look up the diaries and/or records of Christian missionaries who sayed on in Nanjing during and after the Japanese occupation. They are remarkably detailed, and include names, dates, photos, and other damning evidence."
1,History from Japan's perspective,"If you believe the writings in this book, then you'd have to also believe that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki!!!"
1,This author has been obviously brain washed,"If this author has lived through the Nanking massacre by the Japanese army, he will be eating his own words now. Failure to admit and remorse for this atrocity is one of the biggest crimes in human history. I'm afraid this author has been so disillusioned by his own nationalist thoughts that he actually believes his own lies. Sad and people like this Author are really deplorable"
3,The fact...,"Here's one... When I was younger, 'til this day I still remember what my maternal grandmother had once told me: When the Japanese soldiers forced into her house, they had slapped her and beaten her up badly, and even made my grandmother's friend [a girl] kneel on broken glass in front of everyone...Even today, when asked, my dad still won't go into the horrific details on what he saw the Japanese did back then, and 'til this day he still refuses to buy a Japanese car.I think my dad's a little silly about that, but then again, I have not experienced on what he saw and witnessed. Also at one point in her life, my same grandmother had to work really hard as a servant for a Japanese family, and she said that they were really nice to her, and each day they had given her a cup of rice for her and her family. She just told me that recently [she's 92 now] and I just couldn't help but wept..."
1,Unscholarly,"Quote from another review:Since when do communists tell the truth?Such a moronic comment just shows what kind of people read this book. Tanaka's work is filled with the most basic fallacies of reasoning, ranging from broad generalizations to post hoc conclusions, and deceptive quoting out of context, a technique that only pundit Ann Coulter could stoop so low to.He even has the audacity to say on page 37: ""This writer is unable to understand why Japanese textbooks contain accounts that distort the facts, and encourage our children to despise their motherland and their forebears."" Typical childish, illogical right-wing whining about how truth = hatred of one's country.Tanaka brings forth some interesting evidence, but until he learns to grow up and start writing in a scholarly fashion, he needs to do a basic review of how a writer constructs reasonable arguments."
2,Prevarications,"I have read most of the books out in Japanese, Chinese, and English on the Rape of Nanking. I have personally met survivors as well as Japanese officers that were stationed there. According to all I've learned, I've learned that though figures are fuzzy and there's some funny math going on, more than 200,000 people were killed in Nanking during the 6 months it was occupied by the Japanese. Not all these people were killed during the first few weeks of the invasion, and therefore, the number is more plausible. However, the injustice done to the Chinese people that happened there remains and should be remembered through time."
1,Think About This,"Think about this for a moment, every Japanese book ever written about this incident calls it a lie. Every other book, Chinese, American, European says it happened and sites the same information over and over again, from a magnitude of sources. Didn't the Nazis deny the holocaust too? At least until they couldn't anymore. Just some food for thought."
4,For fans of HMS Fable.,"The Pale Fountains were the first band Michael Head of Shack and Strands fame was in. This is their debut record plus assorted b-sides and singles from the same era.It is pleasant enough, and makes a nice companion piece to HMS Fable. Sadly though, some of the tracks are better represented on the 12 inch singles if you can find them. Most apparent is ""Just a Girl"" which as the B-side of ""Someting on My Mind"" remains an excellent tweepop masterpiece but the version represented here has somewhat annoying female=soul background vocals.Still, minor quibbles aside this Pale Fountains release remains an intriguing look into one of the great modern misunderstood geniuses, Michael Head. And because not many people bought Pale Fountains records when they came out, this CD reissue is probably the only way most of us are ever going to hear them at all. So, Kudos."
2,Not bad but could be better.,"Personally, I found this movie rather boring. It's got it's moments and there are a few laughs. Basically, it's about a typical night at a little restaurant in England and how each of the women deal with working there instead of whatever they really want to do. The main selling part is that Neve Campbell performs a really nice nude scene toward the end of the movie. I doubt that I would have watched this movie if it weren't for that scene and I'm not sure if I will watch it again."
1,I really hate my job.,"I'm a huge fan of Neve Campbell, but this movie was a complete mess. It was really boring and Neve was the only one who could act in the movie. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this."
1,Nice coffee--when it didn't leak!,"I purchased TWO of these units and both had the exact same problem: I'd pour water into the unit, turn it on, and come back after a few minutes to fetch my coffee only to find the unit sitting in a huge puddle of water! (Not a very good thing to happen to an electrical appliance, either!) The first unit broke after two years; the second after 4 months! No more Krups for me; I'm only buying Braun or Cusinart from now on."
1,Leaks like a sieve,"Don't buy this product. We can't use it without a towel under the unit, as it begins leaking all over the countertop towards the end of each cycle."
5,Took My Breath Away!,This set is amazing! I just finished listening to the 7th. The Finale was like no performance I have ever heard (and I've heard hundreds over the years). It took my breath away. The whole set is a a gift from the gods. I can only imagine that WF had plenty of rehearsal time to refine the highly crafted phrasing and astounding articulations. Buy this set if you love Beethoven!
3,Unexceptional,"I was hoping for an extraordinary performances but these are really run of the mill. I heard some recording of Wagner by Furtwangler at Bayreuth Festival in early 50's and they had great patho's , which is what encouraged me to buy these .I forget that the players in the orchestra create the feel of the music. Maybe I'll look into some of his later Beethoven .Two star because they are old recording so we miss the fidelity and clarity of newer creations.Perhaps what I'm really looking for is Beethoven's son , somebody able to take up the baton. Or at least permutate his symphonies into a new listening experience.Any Ideas anyone?"
3,Late Romantic Beethoven/Furtwaengler,"This performance may be a good representation of Furtwaengler at his peak but it is a poor representation of what Beethoven wrote and intended. I have only heard the 5th from this set but it is so slowly paced and weighty that it misses all the power and energy that is in the score. This is a prime example of what Beethoven (a classical era composer) became at the hands of the turn-of-the-century romantic conductors. I find it just too ponderous to listen to more than once. To hear what the bold and brash Beethoven really wrote, find a recording that is at least performed near the written tempo and without extra pauses put in for effect. Carlos Kleiber is better but still has the extra pauses. Benjamin Zander is correct but less exciting than Kleiber. It may take another generation to get back to the originial Beethoven in recordings."
2,I cringed.,"This one disappointed me. My reference is the Abbado (not that it's the Holy Grail either) and this was quite mannered by comparison. Not to take away from its genuine importance to historians, completists and fans of this style. For me - and probably only me - the problem is the phrasing and rhythm. I can hear its era, the innocent syncopation of the day. It reminds me of Snow White. (Kill me)The performance must have been impressive, judging by the zealous reviewing going on here, but it didn't speak to me that way.No loss. I am always interested to hear how music evolves over the decades. Recording technologies are not the only thing to advance."
4,"Cyprus, paradise on earth","I am from Cyprus, and I found this book very intresting. The author does a good job talking about the culture of the island and gives the basics for anyone that wants to pay a visit to this beautiful island. It is not in great detail but for a pocket book and for its prize has a great deal of information."
5,Great toy for little girls,"I bought this product originally for my daughter, age 4, for her birthday, and she liked it so much we got it for her best friend's birthday (also 4) two weeks later! What's so interesting is that my six-year-old son also enjoyed making ""cool"" necklaces with it. It greatly helped with fine motor skills but mostly was great fun."
2,Cheap,"If you're gonna call something ""Connoissuer Line"" (which is mis-spelled BTW), and charge $13 for it, you should at least make a quality product. I'm giving it 2 stars because I like the looks and the non-round dial. But, if I run water over the dial, it fogs up inside. Cheap."
3,Schermerhorn Genealogy & Family Chronicles,"The book is out of print and this reprint has terrible photos-could have left them out. Since this is my family tree, I really wanted photos too and it should have said that somewhere."
1,Not what I ordered,I Ordered Adobe Illustrator 8. Adobe Illustrator 7.0 was sent. It is 32 bit and does not work on my system. I am highly disappointed. I can't rate a product I have no use for.
1,still waiting for my order,This is the worst service i have ever encountered on amazon. I purchased a book and payed for two day shipping. Now a week after my order i still have not received my order or any return emails from this seller. I had to file a claim with amazon and found out that Lisa's Great Books still hasn't even shipped my order. I highly recommend not buying from this seller as it will only be a waste of time. If i could give 0 stars i would
2,weak characters but fasinating ideas,"OK, this is not the stuff of new. Basically what we have is a first contact story with a non-human race that once again proports to have staggering powers and abilities that far surpass humanity. Nevertheless, Haldeman weaves tremendous amounts of satire and wit that keep the readers attention through a rather overdone plotline. While I enjoyed the read, I found this was a book with great potential and fasinating ideas that never bears fruition. The characters are cardboard cutouts and integrating any type of romance in that atmosphere (which it did) leads to some tedious dialog and pointless situations.The book gets interesting once we meet the alien race and becomes a great page turner. I loved Forever War as well as All My Sins Remembered but this felt a shadow of a book compared to the former two."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Important new technologies not fully understood.There are a couple in this book, one method actually allows physical transportation over huge distances, the other allows mental communication in a similar fashion.The book takes a look at some of the scientific process that went into these discoveries - some accidental, and the upshot of what happens when you don't actually completely understand what is going on, or why you actually have this."
4,Science fiction after 30 years,"Having read this book 30 years after it was written is fascinating. Back when this was written, computers were just in their infancy. Yet, Joe Haldeman dreamed and wrote about outer travel in typical science fiction manner which would work even today. In fact it even makes a better read in 2009 than it could have in 1978."
1,Slim pickings,"Alex Belth's ""Stepping UP"" is slim pickings. It is a sportswriter's cursory portrait of Flood sacrificing his career for the benefit of all players suffering from the restrictions of baseball's reserve system. It is a creampuff light example of what can be done without real research, and it is full of errors--major character's names misspelled, a reference to small claims court when the venue was federal district court, and much more. For a serious book about Flood, see Brad Snyder's ""A Well-Paid Slave,"" and for a challenge to both books, see Stuart L. Weiss, ""The Curt Flood Story: The Man Behind the Myth,"" due in April from the University of Missouri Press."
1,Skip this dance,"I have never started a book and been unable to finish it, especially an espionage novel that boasts to be in the same tradition of Ken Follett and Robert Ludlum. Unfortunately, there is always a first for everything. Spy Dance has an interesting plot that has the potential to be good, but the writing is so poor that I couldn't even finish half of the novel. The dialogue is cheesy and the characters are one-dimensional. You never get to really know the David, Daphna, Sagit, or Madame Blanc and they certainly aren't believable.I can't even describe how bad this book is and can't believe it was published... Too bad, because as I said, it could be an intersting story."
1,Not worth the read.,"This book appeared very interesting until I started reading it. Without belaboring the point... the dialogue, the characters, the storyline... stilted, shallow, predictable. I could go on but it's really not worth it. There are plenty of other GOOD thrillers out there. Read one of them."
2,The Speed of Its Plot Is Its Only Merit,"This book is terribly written. As another reviewer said, I am surprised that it even found a publisher. The dialogue is unbelievable, the pacing uneven, many of the plot devices are transparent, and the characters make Pinnochio's stillborn brother seem human.The only reason I am giving it two stars is the speed of the plot; it works (just barely) as a brain-dead page turner. If it is the only book in the airport, it'll keep you occupied for at least half the flight."
4,Fast Fun Ride,Out of the headlines and onto the page. Sometimes I couldn't keep track of what I was watching on CNN and what I was reading in the book. Loads of plot. Twists and turns. (...) spies. Middle-Eastern politics. American hero. The book has got soon-to-be-a-major-motion-picture written all over it. A lot of fun.
2,Do you enjoy children's music recitals?,"Because that is what this ablum feels like. It's like your little brother proudly displaying his ability to play ""Voodoo Chile"" while he labourously plucks out the basics of the lead riff. I'm not saying that the musicians of this album don't have talent, it's just that the arrangements aren't very musical. It's just a bare husk of what Ok Computer is. It's not music itself, it's just a shadow of a greater work. It could have been good with a full orchestra, and some more varied instrumentation. All in all, it's not worth the purchase for anyone less than your a most hardcore radiohead fan."
2,Could have been much more,"This is not much more than a retread of radioheads original arrangements, and there is just too much empty space where proper string arrangements should have been created. Many opportunities for beautiful harmony that are missed. Some tracks are haunting and lovely, but its a fairly static sound overall. Great concept, could have been much more."
5,RADIOHEAD FANS WILL LOVE THIS,I love radiohead and i love the classics... and what a better way to listen to radiohead than with a radical violin guy and some other classical instrument players wailing on OK Computer tunes.My favorite track is the haunting and dark Exit Music. I love how these musicians turned it into something sad and kinda scary- a huge leap from its original intention.Overall a daring undertaking that must have been as emotionally draining as it is to listen to.Bravo guys. Bravo.-Music Genius
4,Worth the Money,"This is a great album. There are some comprimises made being a translation from Rock and Roll to Classical, but I think they're liveable. After the comparisons to the original stop running around in your head, you can appreciate it for what it is.The fact is, OK Computer translates well to this format. Radiohead is *that* good that what almost seems like a note for note transcription from the original, converted to four part harmony, can first of all, translate. Second, at times convey the original despaire and desolation. Without even a voice to latch on to, without familiar drums it can be even more haunting than the original.While I don't think I'll listen to this as often as the original, it will certainly get plays, and it gives you a greater appreciation for Radiohead. It's not everyone whose music can translate so well to a different format... The ""Strung Out"" folks might disagree with me as this is one of several CDs from them."
2,"A Good Idea, Poorly Implemented","When I first heard this album was going to come out, I felt the concept was great. But after purchasing and listening to the album, I realized that all it made want to do was listen to the real OK Computer. The music lacked depth and emotion, but I felt the pieces were played well technically. I ended up returning the album, after all if I want to listen to OK Computer I have the album and it sounds much better than this rather dry cracker of a tribute."
2,Collection Piece; Musically Bland,"I would have to agree with the argument that this CD was added to my collection mostly for fan-based reasons. The music itself is fairly bland and uncreative in its interpretations, and as it was also previously said, the quartet lacks the power to make the climaxes in many of the songs work. After listening to this album once, I gave it a second shot a few days later, but quickly just ditched it for the real Radiohead album."
2,silly,"I love Radiohead, this is a silly representation of the songs played note for note by people who have no clue about the band . I found it somewhat painful to listen to; in my mind, a squandered opportunity. Then again, a challenging one. To pull this off, the musicians would have had to be true fans, capable of adding something new. Oh, and mimicing the vocal note for note with a violin? Please. How uncreative can you get. Everynow and then..little pieces of float out there that are actually pretty good. But then that vocal violin kicks in. ugg. There it goes, filed with the rest of the CDs I never listen to."
4,Amazing!,"OK Computer is already a very orchestrated album, full of subtlety and angst and melancholy goodness, so the intimate and morose setting of a string quartet brings this quality out in spades. there are admittedly a few times when i do wish the album had made use of a full orchestra rather than just a four-piece, but again, i think the smallness helps convey what radiohead was trying to convey on the album...a certain solitude, desperation. So ultimately, it works wonderfully. i want some of these tracks played at my wedding, they're so good! my fave tracks are probably paranoid android, karma police and climbing up the walls. and the little solo in airbag is way cool. listen to me and all these other reviews...this album is good. top-notch musicianship, arrangement and production. the only reason i gave it four, rather than 5, stars is that they didn't write the music...radiohead did. but top props to The Section!"
3,Couldn't quite take it ...,"One of the great things about Radiohead is the amount of texture in their songs, which I thought the string quartet doesn't quite manage to emulate. I also think the replacement of vocals with a violin sounds a bit naff. Covering Radiohead with a full symphony orchestra - now there's an idea ..."
2,Flat,"This is such a good idea, executed with skilfully but perhaps too closely tied to the source material. The arranger has actually done a great job of creating organic quartet pieces from the source material - elements such as the mood changes in android are handled well. The problem is that the result is very flat. If you are a mad fan of Radhiohead and buy this, don't ever listen to the Balanescu Quartet's arrangements of Kraftwerk or David Byrne. It'll kill this disc!In short: like watching a movie that _could_ have been good."
3,eh.....It's OK,"I am a Radiohead fanatic.. they are by far my favorite music group. BUT to put this review simply, I'll never listen to this CD all the way through more than once in a GREAT while and maybe pull it for the occasional ""Hey, look at this"" for my friends. I think one person put it the best.. If OK Computer is going to be put to strings.. they should have been backed by an orchestra. A quartet just doesn't put forth enough punch in some of the more climatic parts of the CD.. I do agree however, that because I love Radiohead so much, I needed to buy this CD only to add to my collection. It would have been incomplete without it I suppose."
4,brings even more variety to a Radiohead collection,"'Ok Computer' is my favorite album of all time. While listening to the entire album through you go through so many different emotions and thoughts. I love how it was put together. The album by Strung Out is definately worthy. They are really good musicians and they change the music to string form as good as can be done with a 4-piece. Listening to the strings version of Ok Computer brings even more variety when you're looking for a radiohead disc to put in. My favorite is probably ""no surprises"" It is melancholy and bittersweet sounding at the sime time. I would say this is a must-buy. I agree with another review that said he/she rated it a 4 because they did not actually write the songs."
1,Hackwork,"I bought this hoping it might do for Radiohead what Philip Glass did for David Bowie's ""Low"" and ""Heroes."" Wrong! It sounds like a bunch of bored amateurs bought sheet music for Radiohead, divvied it up amongst themselves, and recorded themselves sight reading. A number of reviewers have already commented on how the ""artists"" here failed to interpret the music they were playing (it apparently not having occurred to them that a string quartet is a different medium than an experimental art/rock band). But it's worse: the instruments sound hard and scratchy and none too well tuned, either. This tribute is unworthy, both for the band and for the space it took up in my iPod."
1,Flimsy,"This is a very cheap product in several meanings of the word.Its female connector is very flimsy: a bare layer of metal, definitely not the product depicted on the web page.Its male end is pretty hard to fit into my Sony laptop's iLink slot.I can't download my videos from my camera with this: whether that is the failure of this hardware is a question yet unanswered, though I would't be surprised.Since this piece costs $0.01, sending it back is not an option.You may want to do yourself a favor and buy something for a few more bucks that has quality."
1,Failed within weeks,"The adapter worked out of the box, then suddenly failed less than two months after purchase. You get what you pay for."
1,Very poor look at the world of business innovation,"As a manager who has looked at business innovation for nearly three decades, I can assure readers that this is not the correct approach. This book is sycophantic nonsense. It is a rag bag of ideas, none of which tie in in any coherent way. There are a million business books out there- skip this one."
5,Cheesy but Great!,My daughter loves these cheesy gory flicks...it's an evening of laughter for her! The price was good for the entertainment.
3,the quality is no good,"the color are great , but the quality of the fabric it no good , dont waste your money and look for a better brand"
5,better than tazo!,I love Chai latte. It's what I spend my Starbucks gift cards on. I recently found this at my local grocery store. Awesome!
1,Not a book for Unix/Sybase web server builders,"If you are like me looking for guides in building Sybase-based web servers on unix machines, you can safely stay away from this book. It says practically nothing about sybperl, dbi and that sort of creatures."
2,"Not an advanced book, good for new programmers","The book is good enough for a person to learn sybase and we-sites, but no good if you are familiar with sybase. It's not an advanced book."
2,Very Disappointing--Not at all what I expected,"When I bought this book, I expected to learn HOW to create a website that accesses a Sybase Database. If you are trying to learn the same thing, then this book is a real waste of time. This book does a good job of telling you what you need in your website, but it does nothing to tell you how to get it there. It is very informative on the different possibilities out there for a Web-based database, but then you will need to buy other books that show you how to physically write the code for the website (i.e.-CGI Script, PERL, SQL, etc.). All included, this book helped me to understand the scope of the project, and what needed to be done. However, I think he could have done that in about 100 pages, rather than 400 pages."
1,This book is quite bad.,This book was written with no regard to any UNIX sybase systems and seems to be a manual for the online tools that are provided with the book. It does not actual tell you how to do anything but rather what approach you you should take if you were going to do it. I'll be returning this book.
4,Fun Game for Using Imagination,"I love this game! My daughter got it for her 4th birthday and it is a wonderful way for her to use her imagination. This is a game the whole family actually enjoys playing together. My one disappointment is that the rules ask each player to recited the entire story before adding to it with their next card. She got bored and frustrated with the repetition. I understand the purpose of this rule, and it was fine for a while, but it really slowed the game down and I could see her interest waning after 10 or 15 cards. She just wanted to bust out the creativity! We now play by just adding to the story, but will try following the intended rules when she gets a little older."
5,Wonderful game,"I have 5 kids between the ages of 9 and 18mo. They all love the game. We have played it several times and they all love it. We took it to a family gathering and everyone had a great time playing, from the kids to the grandparents. Even the college age Aunts had a great time. Wonderful game. I would recomend it to anyone looking for a fun and easy game for all ages!"
5,Learning and fun,"This game is wonderful for the imagination of small and even big children! As you make up the story from thepicture on the card, the child can let their imagination go anywhere, and as an adult playing with the child,you can expand on their knowledge of how to make interesting and fun stories."
2,Ok cheese cutter,Good cheese cutter. Each wire lasted about 6 months. I would even hand wash this thing so rust would not set in as advised.I wish I could order more wires.
3,Trudeau adjustable cheese slicer,"I am not sure I like this product, it is made sturdy, but the cheese is either too thick or too thin..."
2,Not good for left-handed users,"I can't figure out why it would make a difference which hand is used with this product, but so far, when I've tried to use it (with my left hand), the roller immediately falls off. This happened three times in a row. I was attempting to cut a nice smooth block of cheddar cheese. When my girlfriend tried it (she's right-handed) it worked fine and the roller didn't fall off. I would return it, but it's not worth the bother, and I already threw away the package. Anyway, I'm able to use it without the roller attached at all (just with the wire), though I don't have as much control over the thickness of the slices. I guess I'll try again in the future with a different piece of cheese, but I'm not optimistic!"
1,Trudeau Adjustable Cheese Slicer,"I ordered this slicer from Amazon.com and I'm back again looking for another one but this time without a wire. Now, it's my turn to hopefully help someone from making the same mistake I did with the purchase of this cheesy wire slicer. Before long you will be cutting convex slices of cheese due to the wire stretching, and put up with it until you feel the need to change the wire. When you make the decision that it's time for a change I hope you get the wire in place and ready for more slicing, but if not; 'cause the new wire won't stretch enough to get the brass squares into place for the screws, even with needle nose pliers, you'll be back here looking for another slicer without a wire while this one rests in a garbage can."
2,Are you interested in health improvement?,"I was impressed with the build quality of this slicer. I also liked the replaceable wire feature, in case it breaks. The novel method of adjusting for thickness of slices was ingenious, too. However, the metal roller is made of aluminum. Personally, I do not want aluminum in any kitchen product to contact the food I eat. The health hazards of aluminum are considerable, and are well established. I cannot recommend this product to anyone who is concerned about improving their health. To me, improving one's health is a far more important issue than convenience or ease of use. I have decided to use steel knives to cut cheese instead, although it may take longer, or be more difficult to do."
1,OVER HYPED.,ACTUALLY I WOULD NOT RATE THIS ITEM WITH ANY STARS.INSTRUCTIONS WERE CONFUSING AND IT WAS MORE TROUBLE THAN IT WAS WORTH. AN ORDINARY SHARP KNIFE LEFT THIS ITEM IN TEE DUST.I HAD TO RETURN IT.
2,Worth $40,"[...]Printing envelopes is a challenge. Just figuring out the proper settings to print envelopes was a headache. Moisture sealing envelopes cannot be used because they seal themselves as they pass through the printer. Only pull and seal envelopes can be used. Often the addresses come out splotchy with part of the address barley visible.After about 6 months of using the printer, everything I print has a vertical yellow streak and the left side of each page.Included cartridges are half filled and replacements are very expensive.UPDATE:I just took a baseball bat to mine and I feel so much better. This thing was going into calibration mode for hours on end. Completely unusable."
1,"Good Printer, BAD Shipping","I received my purchase on time, the first thing I noticed was that the packaging was not conducive to receiving the product in good order. My worst fears came to be, the printer made a lot of noise, the pages it printed were smudged appearing and the paper had a sharp crease as it came out.My technician inspected the printer and found evidence that the printer had been dropped damaging the fuser unit. I purchased a new fuser unit, replaced it repaired other shipping damages and put the printer into service.So far the printer has been working properly, it is quite and no crease.Having to purchase a new fuser, the labor and down time made this item very costly, but I needed it for my business.At this point I would be reluctant to make another purchase like this from Amazon. I recently purchase another printer from EBAY and received it in perfect condition, probably will use EBAY from now on."
1,"Died, HP refuses to support","Printer worked quite well for a while, print quality and speeds were what we expected. Then the printer began giving error messages indicative of an internal hardware error.I called HP thinking (stupidly) that they would stand behind the quality of their products. they asked for some numbers inside the printer, then told me that it was out of warranty, and I would have to pay $40 to get technical support. I find it funny that they never bothered to ask when I bough t the printer before stonewalling me with a claim that it was out of warranty.So now I have a paperweight, because I refuse to spend$40 just to find out what replacement part I need to order to fix HP's garbage. This printer lasted half as long as my Epson inkjet.DO NOT BUY - The company that makes this product refuses to stand behind it."
2,Cannot share printer on network,"Printer prints fast and great from the PC it is connected to, but when I shared the printer and installed on other computers in the network, it does not print from those PCs. The job gets queued on the ""serving"" PC but hangs in the queue. I have to restart the print spooler service so the job prints. Contacted HP and they said ""We would like to inform you that this printer does not support network printing"", I said, ok I know it doesn't support a network card but surely you can share it using windows file & print services and print to it from other PCs on the network. They said ""No, we do not recommend sharing the printer through windows"". What a joke. Who ever heard of a printer that couldn't be shared through windows. I still suspect their support personnel just don't what they're talking about and I'm sure I can get it to work by trying different drivers but to just come out and say that it doesn't support netowrk printing is lame."
1,"nice until it breaks, and it will","Mine broke after 1 year of light use. It started to marble the page and smeared a vertical red line on the left side of the page. Other users reported similar problems.It's an excellent printer for about a year, after that you can throw it away (which is not that easy btw).You save money because it is low priced, but it will cost you a lot in the end. The expensive toners are not that much of an issue because it probably doesn't last that long ..."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"I brought this printer thinking it was complete with printer cartridges. I called the seller directly and she stated that Amazon put the wrong ad on this product. I could have brought this ""COMPLETE"" printer from Tiger Direct for $75 more then what I paid Amazon, but the printer is no longer on sale at Tiger Direct. The company gave me an 800 # to buy the printer cartridges for $160 (rebuilt) and I found out I would have to pay $346.00 for new hp Cartridges. I was promised other solutions and the company never followed through. I have filed a complaint w/my credit card company."
3,Not for Scrapbookers!,"The printer has nice colors and prints beautifully if it's on regular paper. However, if you scrapbook and need to print on cardstock, do NOT buy! As a previous reviewer stated it starts to get messy after one copy. I returned mine. Also, it is quite a beast (tall and with a large footprint), so make sure you've got a large space for it to live. I would recommend this printer if you want bright, clear colors on basic paper only (especially if it's on sale for $180 at a local office supply store), which is where I bought and returned mine..."
2,Cartridges are more expensive than actual printer,The actual printer is fine and the print quality is excellent however the cartridges are $85 for black and $94 each for 3 color cartridges! $367 for cartriges? Crazy...
1,junk junk junk junk,"i did research before buying this printer on the cost of printing versus the cost of ink toner refills, and this printer was more economoical than the Brother color laser that was similar. now i wish i had bought the Brother printer, my cyan toner ran out. so i ordered a replacement. it came and i put it in the printer and flashing light kept telling me to order more toner. so i then went and took back the toner and came home with another. thinking that after having the printer for 4 years and using it very sparingly, how could it possibly be my printer that broke. after coming home today and being told by a printer repair shop, that the cost of this broken sensor is more that the cost of a new printer. i am making the switch from HP to Brother. save your MONEY do not buy this printer"
4,Repeat Customer,"This is my 2nd Color LaserJet 1600. First one got me 78,000+ prints before problems with Magenta color. Repairs more than cost of new printer so am using old one for B&W jobs."
5,HP 1600,"I have had this printer for about 4 years and it's beautiful, prints beautiful, etc.. I paid $169.00 brand new from HP.... why would anyone pay $599.00 for this printer? At this point it's old technology even though it's a great printer."
1,Don't buy if you have a mac.,This just won't work well with a Mac. It is not directly supported by HP and the open source drivers produce muddy color pictures at best. Go with an HP 2605 or The new Brother wireless color laser printer instead.
2,Very large and ink very expensive...,"In a weak moment I fell for the hype about this printer. After having had such god-awful printers with poor print quality that always ran out of ink I wanted a great printer. This HP performs beautifully, no jams,copies are pretty,the colors are amazing, etc. The downside of this HP 1600 is that it is very large and takes up half my desk and the worst part of it is the ink supply did not live up to the advertising. Also, the replacement Ink cartridges are too expensive! There is no gray scale level which would use less ink and thereby saves money and ink. If you want a test copy-it will use 100% ink. The life of the ink cartridge was suppose to be 500 printed pages before requiring a new cartridge but that hype turned out to be untrue so that is a huge disappointment. All in all the printer was too expensive and now that I am stuck with it and have to buy expensive ink! Do not buy this it's a money pit even if you do not do heavy printing."
1,Poor support--especially for Vista.,"Go to their website and try to download a Vista driver. Good luck. Go to their installation troubleshooting webpage and look for Vista help. You won't find it.This printer worked fine with XP, but it won't work with Vista. Online support is terrible. Buy it at your own risk.I'm rapidly souring on Hewlett-Packard. Their one-time reputation for quality is eroding fast."
3,Inability to Edit,"I think overall the camera is a marvel. The quality of the images and the audio are much better than I was used to with VHS-C. And the compactness of the camera goes without saying. However, I belatedly discovered that there is no way to edit your the tapes on a computer as the comparable (and cheaper) JVC model can. JVC includes free software so that you can download, cut, reassemble, add effects and so on. With the DCR-PC1 you must purchase Sony's editing machine (if you can find it) at a list price of approximately $2,000. I am now patiently waiting for Sony or a third party to develope editing software. If editing is important to you, this not your camera."
4,Digital Video Editing on your PC,"An earlier review stated that it was not possible to edit digital video from the DCR-PC1 on a desktop computer. I bought a third party FireWire board and DV editing program bundle for my PC (I paid $80) and had the board installed, the software running, and video downloaded from my camera in under an hour. While cracking open a computer case and installing a new board might not be everyone's idea of fun, it is a simple procedure and greatly enhances the value of the camera. I've been very pleased with the DCR-PC1 and carry it everywhere I go."
4,Outstanding,"I purchased this camcorder Oct. 1999. The picture quality is crystal clear in good lighting conditions, grainy in low light conditions. I also purchased a ... hardware/software package from Pinnacle Systems ... that allows me to edit video and audio captured on the camcorder on my PC. This is a very innexpensive way to produce high quality home movies. The best feature of the camcorder is its size-you take it everywhere."
1,Very dissapointed with picture quality,"To make this unit useful I had to spend $500 more and by a wide angle lens, in addition the color quality is very poor, there are no features available on a $400 Sony, like infared link, and 0 lux. Save the money and buy something else."
5,A Very Important View of the Future,"The Support Economy stands out from most books about business because it is rooted in history and explains the cause ( not the symptoms ) of many of todays problems. The idea that value no longer resides inside the company but outside it ( is distributed) is fundemental to Zuboff and Maxman""s argument. It may seem radical but it also makes sense;- people have played with this idea without being clear about it. This idea sets the stage for a whole new view of the future, where the money is, how cash moves and what technology can do. Support of the individual ( you and me ) becomes the goal and products and service are part of support. Control, ownership and IP follow value and become distributed.... the peer to peer techie delight. This book will stand the test of time and is brave and bold invitation to look at the big picture rather than next week."
2,I am smarter than you !,"The core of the book is correct, but much is an attempt to show how clever the writers are and how much research they have collected over the years. Sure a business does need the people who drive their own car to a passenger's home 150 miles away to deliver a birthday present left on their aircraft, but if you have more than a few of these, you go broke. If things look too good compared to the world around them then they probably they are just too good to be real. Markets are a fine balance bewteen giving paying customers what they will pay for, and having a few layers of very thin gold plate (based on extreme service stories) that make the offer look better than what they are paying for today. Ask anyone who started a business (and gets paid last after the staff and the government) if they believe in the tooth fairy of good times capitalism, and they will tell you if this exists, they are yet to see it."
1,A Pedantic Mess of a Good Idea,These authors are on the right track but they are more interested in impressing readers with their vocabulary than following through with some do-able solutions. I firmly believe that corporations need to catch up to what the customer really wants but this book meanders through a maze of technical and non-related issues which distract from the great theme it is about. I trudged through the whole book waiting for an answer to the problem I could understand but there was absolutely no common sense I could grasp that would lead me to a satisfactory conclusion. Felt like I was back in school again. Ugh!
4,Awesome puzzles,These puzzles are great quality and very durable for a 3-4 year olds. My grandson loves the puzzles and i am very pleased with how well they hold up.
3,This puzze is kinda scary for a 2-3 year old,"Guess I should have looked at this puzzle a little more closely. I think it would be okay for an older child, but I was purchasing for a 2 1/2 year old, who loves to put puzzles together."
5,Dinasaur cardboard floor puzzle,"Bought this puzzle for my [...] and [...] grandsons. They loved it, particularly the younger boy. It is a beautiful and sturdy puzzle."
4,Great gift,Bought this as a gift for a friend's son for his 4th bday. He loved it. Big and sturdy. Hard enough for him to have to work at it with his mom but not so hard that he was frustrated. She said it was a great next step from the puzzles he'd been doing and he loves the dinosaurs.
5,Ultra Quiet! Hooray!,"Finally someone has created a hair dryer that doesn't assault your ear drums! Now I can have a conversation or listen to the morning news while I dry my hair. I agree that the airflow seems a bit light compaired to the other Conair dryer I own, but I think that is because the nozzle is wider. When I attach the ""air flow concentrator"" adapter that came with the Ultra Quiet, the air flow is equal to that of my other dryer. I love that it is Ultra Quiet and am so happy with it that I just ordered a second one for travel."
2,Not enough POWER,"This is VERY quiet but i feel it compromised the power. If you looking for a quick blow dry, forget it, this thing takes forever. And the cord is way too short for me! Not satisfied."
1,Ultra Quiet=Poor Performance,"The bi-product of an ""Ultra-Quiet"" motor is lack of air pressure. I hope that product development/evolution will truly synthesize a ""true"" functional ""Quiet"" Hair Dryer.This product certainly is quiet, but it is not a good Hair Dryer."
5,I love it!,"What I like: Low blow! I prefer to have a blow dryer that doesn't blow my hair all over the place. This gives me the opportunity to actually style while I dry. Heat! The temperature is good and hot. Hair dries quickly with out all the air movement. Quiet! Yup. It's quiet. Conclusion- I have some natural curl, but diffusers don't seem to do the job for me. Not enough heat. This dryer supplies lots of heat without too much wind."
4,"Interesting, Inovative",I very much enjoyed this album. I'm a VV myself and the music spoke to me experientially. And maybe more important it was good jazz!
4,Bang's first take,"This is an earlier CD, worth listening to if you want to see how Billy Bang got to the place where he could record Reflections. And a good CD in itself, worth listening to if you are a musician wanting to break out of the Jazz Standards rut."
2,"I wanted to like this album, really I did...","The concept of this album intrigued me--a Viet Nam vet writing a jazz violin work of his impressions. Unfortunately, the execution did not live up to the concept. Billy Bang's composition is sadly cliched and repetitive, and his playing is less than competent. His intonation is so bad that it was painful to hear. I sold the CD a few weeks after buying it."
2,Too Small,"I didn't give enough credence to other reviews about these items not fitting properly; thought that since I matched the tire size with the product I wouldn't have the same problems. Needless to say the chains are too small, by one link. I have not used them, so cannot comment on their worth. Needed the chains for a trip to SLC, so just added the links. Don't know if I'll return them or not."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"Bland and boring, with the exception of the last chapter about the program at the Ohio Reformatory for women where inmates work on various needlework projects which are later donated to charities.While the author told us how impressed she was with what the program was doing for these women, she did not let us in on that in any significant detail or with any depth, we just had to take her word for how impressive the experience was, since she did not bother to allow these women more space to tell just how knitting was affecting them.Good intentions, flimsy and superficial execution, and, all in all, very little substance."
5,THIS MAN IS TRULY ANNOINTED,I JUST LOVE TO DO MY PRAISE AND WORSHIP NIGHTS TO THIS CD!! I CAN'T FOR YOU TO GET IT!! REMARKABLE!!
4,great!,My students love this floor puzzle. I love that they acctually talk about the characteristics of the people in the puzzle.
5,Educational and FUN!,"Circle format makes this one a little more difficult but it balances out because it is only 48 pieces. Love that the children are dressed in traditional costumes and are all holding hands. This is a beautiful puzzle....wish that the relationships between the nations of the world were this simple but.....Nice, simple, introduction to the differences between the world's cultures."
5,fun with my grandson,These puzzles from Mellisa and Doug are super! very sturdy and large enough to get some calmer time with my 3 year old grandson.The bright colors keep him interested and the pictures lead to much discussion and learning.The price on Amazon was much cheaper than Toys R Us and shipping was fast.My daughter runs day care and researches everything before allowing me to purchase.We will continue to buy this brand.Love it!
5,Great purchase!,This puzzle was a real hit with an active group of first graders at their Christmas Around the World event. The cross-cultural characters are charming and provided an opportunity to discuss differences (and similarities) among people. Pieces are durable and fit together easily.
4,Toddler Teacher Terrific!,It's always a challenge to open the minds of young children to the world outside. This puzzle has openned some great conversation already. It is a wonderful visual for kids of all ages!
5,"Fun, bright, and educational",I bought this for my little sister. It was easy to put together and very fun for the both of us. The colors were soo vibrant and the puzzle was larger than I expected! Great for kids! Definitely will buy for another child.
5,Excellent reference,Your book is excellent: I keep it beside me and use it almost daily. Many thanks.
2,not for the professional,This book while well written contains too much stuff that Windows2000 Professional shares with WindowsNT. It is not a good reference book. Perhaps it would be better off positioned as an introductory text because it has too much fluff.
5,"Well written, with in-depth coverage","This book is a welcome reference to Microsoft's latest OS, with thorough coverage and a comprehensive index. Cowart/Knittle's book has deep discussions about networking, VPN, web folders and web-based printing, security, MMC, a chapter on multi-booting, another on Windows Scripting Host, and other meaty topics that I wanted to understand better. Well done, and an entertaining read at times, too. I recommend this book if you want to know what Windows 2000 is about, how to use it, and how to administer it."
4,Aussie Act,"Kisschasy are an aussie pop punk band.At least thats what they say becuase in my opinion there is nothing pop about them.They would be more indie than pop.This is their secong EP.Their first being Darkside/Stay Awake and their first album being United Paper People.This EP has a more rock edge to it than their current album UPP.With tracks Reminder, A Love Affair With Distance, One Mistake and The Way They Walk being outstanding.this EP is brilliant to anyone who like Aussie rock, and to any one for that matter.plus these guys sing with their australian accent so its all the better..."
1,Disappointing,"Rekdal's sentimentality in A Crash of Rhinos is almost as cloying as her sentimentality in The Night My Mother Met Bruce Lee. I want to like the poems, because the author seems genuinely smart and insightful, but what music and power they have is drowned out by a pervasive self-consciousness."
5,Alive,"This is a book of poems with a pulse. Page after page thumps with a rhythm and a language that is both corporal and spectral, sensual and sacred. The inspiration here is a breath of fire, and those with a passion for poetry will most certainly feel invigorated by it."
2,Unclear on the concept,"I bought this cookbook with the expectation that I would make desserts sweetened only with Splenda. To my surprise, the recipes use Splenda to reduce sugar, but include other ingredients such as corn syrup, brown sugar, honey, fruit juice, raisins, sweetened yogurt, candied ginger and canned fruit. On the plus side, it does give you exchanges and a nutritional breakdown for every recipe; but I will have to keep looking for a Splenda-only cookbook."
3,Not for Low Carb-ers,"I have watched Graham Kerr on television since I was a preteen, so I am well aware of his cooking talents, as well as the fact that he changed his lifestyle a complete 180 degrees since his wife had a heart attack; but I was not overly impressed with the cookbook. His recipes are not exciting, just plain simple fare, and absolutely not low carb."
1,Graham Kerr Splenda Cookbook,"Not really happy with this item. No pictures. Recipes are okay, but I like to see what I am cooking. Will probably sell it down the road."
2,Not very helpful,I was disappointed in the small number of recipes in this book. The recipes were very plain.
3,"Sweet, but too dopey","Like Vol 1 the characters are charming and the technical quality ofthe animation is absolutely first class. The problem is that the storylines just go uniformly down hill. By the last episode, Gilligan's Islandlooks like MacBeth in comparison. There will be fouteen year olds whowalk away saying ""Too dopey."" The characters have wonderful potential,so I hope they elevate the writing in later volumes."
3,Average anime with no huge breasts,"Comedy anime isn't really my thing. I'm an EVA style anime freak instead. Now I know that there are a lot of you out there eager to collect (if not watch) every new anime release coming from Japan. After all, sometimes that's me. But slow down and consider what you're watching. ""Love Hina"" is an anime sit-com. It reminds me of ""Three's Company"" set in a scateboarding universe. The animation is so-so, I've seen a lot better. The story pace is quick, almost too caffienated. What makes this show fun to watch is the love story. You watch it hoping (cheering, pulling for, pleading...) that Naru and Ketaro will stop crashing into each other and start falling FOR each other. Romantic sit coms do the same thing (Friends). I just don't know if this kind of writing is enough to keep the show afloat. If there were better animation sequences, more subtleties, less gravity defying Ketaros..."
3,"Great Anime, Bad dub","Love Hina is one of the most popular romanic comedy anime availible. It really pains me to have such a great show be slaped together by a company whos out just for profit. The terible english dub is one proof, and to add to that the subtitles are small and in a font that's hard to read, which make me think they are forcing me to watch it in english. But the only way to watch this is in Japanese, so I bear with the subtittles. This is one of the animes that I wish would be done over again with a better dub and bigger subbtitles in a easy to read font."
4,The fun continues...,"The second in the Love Hina series, this DVD continues the fun, though there are points where the humor goes overboard, i.e. the first episode contains a chase scene where Keitaro runs from a mini-van just before he takes his Tokyo U exam. The stories kept me entertained, and I giggled through each when I wasn't laughing outright. The only gripe I have is with the third episode on the disc. It left me wondering why it was done in the first place. Other than that, if you liked the first four episode, this disc won't be a disappointment."
5,Exelente recurso informativo,"Este libro lo compre como sugerencia de una persona de ALANON Hijos adultos de alcoholicos.Como hija de un alcoholico pasivo, vivi en negacion 30 anios de mi vida siempre con el estigma de ser la ""inadecuada"". Al leer este libro me di cuenta de todas las caracteristicas que vivi en mi hogar y sobre todo como la mayor parte de mi vida sabotie por ignorancia mi forma de vida.A pesar de que Espanol es mi primer idioma, este libro es super facil de leer y comprender.A este libro no le falta nada."
1,Ancient piece of crap (Legacy Technology),"There is no hdmi input/output the subwoofers are incorporated into the rear speakers. I don't know why people purchase this item. Not even a DVI connection (only component) what crap is that in todays day and age. For the same price you can purchase other items which don't solely rely on legacy technology (old ancient technology used for nostalgic purposes). Its like buying a brand new computer with a printer port but without a USB connection. Absolutely pointless! You are purchasing an item that is obsolete today, not tomorrow, but today. Look elsewhere."
2,Disappointment for an organization freak,"The organizer is well made and matched my cabinets and drawers perfectly. However, most of the compartments are stationary, only a few of the pieces are adjustable. I did not have the desired freedom that I imagined when purchasing the product. There is nothing wrong with the organizer itself but it is not as adjustable as I would have liked."
1,Worst DVD purchase yet!,"Basically, I just spent 15.00 for a coaster! I was dissapointed in everything about this DVD. Terrible and repetitive audio, boring ""raw uncensored"", and stalker training/""Ways to Catch a Cheater"" tips. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz in every way, shape, and form."
2,Too Much for one disc,"I like the Cheaters TV show and knew I would like it without all the editing, so, I quickly purchased this product. I assume I should have looked closer,but,I thought I was getting a mulitiple disk set and I got only one disk with two episodes on it...that was it. Two episodes. I was disappointed especially since I paid in excess of $27.00 including the shipping. I won't buy anymore unless I am sure I am getting my moneys worth."
4,Caught on Tape Anyone?,"Like a mixture of Jerry Springer and Candid Camera - Cheaters made me happy to own a television when it premiered in 2000. A classic show that chronicles what must be the wort moment of someone's life. If you like watching people put in uncomfortable situations like being busted cheating on a spouse - and you think that watching someone having to watch a tape of their boyfriend having sex with another girl - then this is the tape for you. However, many people I know just find the show and the whole idea behind it distasteful. While I'm a fan of the show, I think that this DVD may go a bit too far, it becomes pornographic at some points and even slightly disturbing. But if you really enjoy reveling in the pain of others, then this DVD is guaranteed to please."
3,"Quiet, heavy, and a long barrel for shorter arms","I was interested in the Conair Ion Shine hairdryer as a means to keep my hair healthier, plus, my older Conair dryer needed to be replaced. Since I have owned the Ion Shine (in the last 6 months) I've noticed that much more of my hair is breaking off near the scalp and I have a real problem with dryness and lack of body. (I haven't changed any other hair products.) The position of the ion switch is also a concern. I am a short lady so the weight of the dryer and the length of the barrel with the attachment is a problem as well. The dryer seems to run either too hot, or on warm is too cool to dry my fine hair in under 5-7 minutes. This is too long for me on work mornings."
2,a Bit Disappointed,The on/off switch on this dryer needs improvement. I find myself turning the dryer off constantly while using it.
1,Maybe it's just me..but this hairdryer did NOT work for me,"I have really coarse, frizzy, and thick hair. Yes..a rat's nest. Haha. Anyway, I needed to get a new hairdryer and I had heard about the Conair Ion. I bought it. The price was good. The next day, I blew dry my hair and my hair was a complete frizz ball. It fealt like straw. I see this hairdryer is getting good reviews..that's why I'm saying it might just be MY hair that this dryer doesn't work for. But, yeah...just thought I'd put in my input."
2,A disappointment,"My several-year old Conair ""Quiet 1875"" has a cracked casing, so I purchased this to replace it. It is much, much, much noisier than my old Conair ""Quiet 1875,"" takes twice as long to dry my hair and leaves it flat. It does leave my hair soft and shiny, but so did my old hair dryer. It also emits a lot of unpleasant odor, although that might change were I to keep using it (which I won't). I never write reviews, but if you want quiet, really, look elsewhere, such as the ""Quiet 1875."" I did not want a folding hair dryer, which is the only version of the ""Quiet 1875"" available on the 'Zon, but I wish I had bought the folding version of the ""Quiet 1875"" instead of this. In sum, if you are looking for a quiet hair dryer that dries your hair in a reasonable amount of time and also leaves it soft, shiny and looking great, you can do much better without breaking the bank with the ""Quiet 1875."""
3,could be better,"I purchased this hair dryer to replace one my daughter ""borrowed"" from me. I thought this was the same item, but was sadly mistaken. My original blow dryer was also Conair Ion Shine 1875 watts, but it is a much better product, this one feels very plasticy and cheap, it does not have the power you would expect for 1875 watts either.All that being said for the cost of the dryer it works and I will keep it, but next time I will spend a few extra dollars for a higher quality hair dryer."
3,blow dryer,item was shipped quickly. however i was rather disappointed at the quality of the item. it didn't leave my hair as soft as i would have liked it to be. it left my hair big and frizzy.
4,Good purchase!,Pretty quiet and has been working well so far! I like the blue and black color on it and it has nice settings. I reccommend it!
4,3.5,"The air that comes out is strong but I'm used to hotter dryers. It does the job, i like it and give it 3.5 stars! The price is cheap but comes as advertised."
4,nice blow dryer,"Gets my hair dry fast. Has enough power. Two setting high and low, and two heat setting. Only complaint is that the on/off switch is by where you hold the handle, so you do accidentally turn it off sometimes. Otherwise it gets the job done fast and it was a great price."
2,Poor Results,"I've been blow drying my hair for 20 years and this is the worst blow dryer I have ever used. It takes forever to dry my hair and it doesn't give me the sleek results I'm used to. My hair dries to a wispy, flyaway state w frizz. It really doesn't get hot enough and doesn't produce enough air. Really terrible. Someone said it was heavy, but I find it lighter than most. It gets the job done just not well. I have to go over each section of my hair w a large curling iron to smooth the strands. I'm causing extra damage and wasting extra time for no reason. I'm going to go back to the Revlon line. It produces much better, quicker results."
2,Not Good for Thick or Wavy Hair,"This dryer doesn't blow hard or hot enough to straighten the waves out of my hair without a lot of extra styling, which is time-consuming. I have pretty fine, thin hair, so I think this dryer should only be good for people with very straight hair that only want to dry it, not style it. I tried using a styling brush, but the style didn't hold due to the air from the dryer being too cool. I had to use a curling iron. It does leave my hair soft and fluffy, but I wouldn't buy another one."
2,It's really cheap,This is not a heavy-duty hair dryer. It hardly heats up and feels like it's going to crack at any moment. I don't recommend.
4,Does a Good Job,"I have had expensive blow dryers but after research on the web, I decided to try this one based on an article about the best blow dryers - at any price. I do like it and think it does a great job on my hair (and I am etremely picky); however the downside is a short cord. I have had to accomodate by drying my hair in the bath vs. my room. The expensive ones have a much longer cord; however, I will get used to it eventually."
3,Nice for the price.,Nice basic hairdryer. A little slow on the drying though. A little on the large size. Does get the job done.
5,IT BLOWS!,"I can't believe I'm writing a review for a hair dryer... So I won't. :)It works as advertised, and for the price, it's WELL WORTH IT.Buy it now, you can't go wrong!"
3,"all right, but awkward","For the most part, I like this hair drier. It works fine, and I can use it while my kids are sleeping because it's quiet and not high-pitched. But as others have remarked, it is awkward to hold because if you don't get it just right, you can keep turning it off accidentally. (It's especially a problem when I'm using a round brush because part of the control of the hand holding the blowdrier is given to the round brushing.) Really annoying."
3,Overall; Disappointed,"Everything works as advertised, however, it did not meet my expectations. I have generally been very pleased with Conair hair dryers, and the Ion feature seems to really tame the frizz. However, the blower on this model is very slow, so it takes a long time. Sometimes I have to pull out my old dryer to get the wet out, then use this one to finish -- otherwise it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair. Also, the high/low setting is for the blower only, which is useless since high is so slow anyway. The heat is not controlable, except for the ""COLD"" button you have to hold down to get just air. As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are terrible. I almost can't hold it by the handle without turning it off. Occasionally I have gotten through with drying and realized the Ion feature got turned off -- how annoying, especially after having spent 20 minutes drying my hair."
5,YES buy this dryer,"Don't be misled by the price. This is an amazing hair dryer - truly quiet, for those of you looking for a quiet dryer rather than one only labeled as such. Lightweight, easy to manage controls. Wide barrel for larger air flow, which I prefer for my waist-length, thick hair. Concentrator and large diffuser, for those who care, and at least for now, they snap in securely. Two-year warranty. I've never bought a dryer I liked more, even at 3 times the price. May Conair keep making this dryer for decades."
4,Decent hair dryer,"I purchased this dryer because I have another Conair model 1875 that I absolutely love - and I want an extra to keep at work. This one isn't quite as quiet or as quick at drying as my other model 1875, but nevertheless, it is much quicker and quieter than my old ""regular"" hair dryers. I would definitely recommend the product as a replacement to an older or non-ionic model hair dryer."
4,Best Type of Hair Dryer out there!!,"I just started using an ionic hairdryer recently after my cousin requested one as a Christmas gift. I used hers once and I was hooked. My hair is long (mid-back long),wavy and usually frizzy if I don't use straightening products or a blow dryer straightening hair attachment. It used to take me atleast half an hour to completely dry my hair straight on a regular dryer high setting. With the ionic dryer my hair (WITHOUT any balms, gels or attachments) is super shiny, has lots of volume and dries in half that time and has gotten more straighter! There is an even better newer model Conair IonShine Dryer 1875 that has a more ergonomic handle with better settings and buttons. I would recommend this to all my friends and family."
5,"Fast, quiet and less frizz!","Pros:-QuietI usually wear earplugs when drying my hair, but no more! This one's nice and quiet-FastSome people mistake quiet for less power, but this is not true. This dryer dries my hair in half the time of my old noisy one, and I can tell by how much it blows my hair around that it is powerful.-Less frizzThis does not mean NO frizz, sadly, but my hair gets VERY frizzy when dried with a hair dryer, and with this hair dryer, the frizziness was about half as much - a vast improvement!-CompactFolds up and fits in our little drawer!I don't really see any cons with this product. The cord is not very long, but I find that to be a pro because it doesn't get tangled. After all, how far from the outlet do I really need to go?"
5,"Works well, reduces frizz","For its price, it is a good deal. Dries hair nicely and quickly. The ion feature works - it makes the hair shinier and less frizzy. Overall a good investment to manage your hair."
4,"Good product, but care needed with power cord","I purchased this dryer about 3-4 years ago. I have very long hair (below my waist) and it worked just fine for me. The ion feature makes a huge difference in the condition of my hair. Less frizz and less tangling.The other day I was putting it away and noticed a crack in the cord's plastic insulation. When I flexed the cord (after it was unplugged) at the crack the insulation completely separated exposing the wires. Further inspection showed cracks in the insulation every where the cord had been bent when stored.Normally we are very careful to stow appliance cords by folding (accordian style) and using velcro to hold in place. For my new hair dryer I will be less fastidious with the cord storage!You probably should inspect the cord before every use to make sure the insulation is not cracked. It could have caused a fire, electric shock, or worse."
5,nice dryer,"i dont have much experience with dryers, but this one is pretty nice. high speed mode is pretty loud to me, but like i said i have never used any other dryers. i never use it on high speed. low speed and high heat is more than enough to dry my hair...very fast might i add. excellent hair dryer."
1,Conair 1875,"Conair 1875 hair dryerstopped working in less than a month. The reset button won't click, so it won't start. Don't feel like the hassle of trying for a credit or return, don't have packaging. Am going to buy local where I can easily return something."
2,Below average,"If you blow-dry your hair several days a week, I highly suggest getting something nicer than this. I find that this model promotes hair breakage, the plastic accessories come off easily, and the ionic feature doesn't seem to work like it's supposed to. This item recently died on me, and I was actually glad, because now I don't have to feel bad about throwing it away."
2,The accessories are horrible,"I'd say this is just your average hair dryer. I didn't notice anything magical happening with the ionic technology, and the accessories that it comes with are pretty cheap. Particularly the straightening-comb, which falls off every time you run it through the hair. The diffuser worked ok for me."
5,Best dryer I have ever owned!,"This dryer is absolutely AWESOME! It drys my hair very quickly and I have very thick hair. It also doesn't get too hot so that my head doesn't feel fried when I finish with it. I was surprised at how quiet it is to be so quick to dry!I love the fact that it not only has a cool shot button, but also has a straight cool setting. This means you can dry your hair completely on cool in the hottest summer months which is great in the south!This is the best dryer I have ever owned and I would highly recommend it to anyone!!"
5,i like this hairdryer a LOT!!,"This hairdryer is a lot quieter than any others i have used before which allows me to listen to music at a normal level and dry my hair at the same time.. some thing that i havent been able to do with others. It took pretty much the same amost of time that with a non-ionic hair dryer, but the results were a lot better! When im drying my hair straight, it make it very sleek, soft and shiny, yet when i am drying it curly, the curls are well defined, soft and not frizzy at all. At one point i left the dryer at my friends house, and was forced to use an older Revlon regular 1875 watt dryer that make my hair very course and frizzy, and in the end i couldnt wait to get my Conair back!!!"
4,Good hair dryer,"When I read reviews about this dryer stating that it takes longer to dry hair, I was a bit apprehensive about buying it as I have thick hair. However, given that it was not too expensive for a dryer promising features like shinier hair and lesser frizz, I decided to give it a shot anyway.I have now owned the dryer for about a month and I love it! It is pretty quiet and when I dry my hair in sections, it takes just as long as (or slightly lesser than) a regular dryer. I also have noticed that there is lesser frizz and shinier hair (both more noticeable a day *after* I did the actual drying).The one star I have docked off is for the position of the ionizer switch. Initially, I turned it off accidentally once or twice while drying my hair. But now I am used to it and it really isn't a problem any more.I would certainly recommend this dryer."
1,Disappointment with dryer,"I purchased it because it was supposed to be quiet. It's every bit as loud as my old dryer. It's heavy, cumbersome, hard to manage. I kept turning it off because of the location of the buttons on the handle (I didn't have that problem with my old dryer). It kept sucking my hair in the motor area.BUT, I do think there's something to this ion thing. My hair seemed softer and straighter - no frizzies. It also seemed to dry faster. So, I am now on a quest to find a ion dryer that is light, quiet and easy to manage - oh, and doesn't eat my hair."
4,What a buy,"Bought this for my daughter. Very good buy, put in cart and went back to buy and it was even cheaper"
2,Not the best,I always buy dryers with a diffuser because of my big curly hair. But this one is a small bowl shaped diffuser and when I bring it up to dry my hair if blows it out and all over the place. It has these long holes on the side and the air blows straight through and causes my hair to blow all over the place. I have to admit I did like it because of the color and that's why I purchased it; not to forget that Conair is a good product. But if you are using it for the diffuser I'd skip this one.
3,Not a bad dryer,"This really is a good hair dryer, it gets very hot which I love and dries the hair quickly. I have long hair and it didn't take me long at all to dry it. The dryer itself is pretty heavy but that was not a problem for me, to others it may be though. The reason I gave this product a 3 is because I bought it on Sept 4 2010 and finally just had to replace it about 2 months ago because it started to make the most god awful noise when I would use it, I can only describe the noise as slowly murdering a cat behind the engine of a plane. I do like conair products and it was definitely a good dryer and lasted me for quite a while."
2,Lukewarm,"It's more or less sufficient for my thin hair and semi-bald head, but the hottest setting is no more than warm-ish. Other than that, works well."
4,Great blower!,"Love this blower, it works great. It doesn't have the button issue for me like other reviewers said. I would recommend it."
4,conair hairdryer,It is okay. It doesn't get hot enough and the buttons are located where you hit them with your fingers. I am not crazy about it and certainly would want more heat fromit
5,"Works well, great value","I'm on my second one of these. For the price, it's unbeatable. It does its job well, doesn't burn my hair, and dries my fine hair. A great and cheap alternative."
3,Its too heavy...,"if ur a small person.....this is not the dryer for u, ur hand will break while drying ur hair. im reli small an i didnt no it wud be so heavy....so i guess im stuck.....got 2 years warenty with it so i'll see how it goes...."
1,Conair 146XR is Too Cold!,This hair dryer takes forever to dry my hair and it also makes my head cold. I'm going to return it.
4,Good Hairdryer,This hairdryer Works great.I do not see any shine diffrence in my hair though.Transaction was smooth and fast service.
1,NOT VERY STRONG,THIS DRYER DOES NOT BLOW VERY STRONG AND TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HAIR TO DRY. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH PRICE IS GOOD.
2,Hard to handle,This is a bulky and hard to handle hairdryer. It would get to hot. I sent it back for a refund. I don't recommend it.
2,Lasts Less than a Year,"I initially really liked this dryer. I liked it enough that I bought two, one from Target and one from Amazon. It's been a litte under a year and both have serious problems. One no longer gets very warm, and when held at certain angles it looses power. The other one is warm, but the speed/force decreased dramatically a few months ago, and now it's sparking inside while I use it.I usually expect 2-4 years out of a hair dryer, and for me to have two of these, for less than one year, speaks very poorly of the line of dryers."
4,nice dryer,Bought this for my 12 year old for christmas! Great first dryer for her not alot of buttons on/off and hi/low all she needs! and great for travel as well not overly big!
2,Don't buy if your hair is actually thick,"I rarely write reviews. Only when I am very, very pleased or very frustrated. I'm frustrated. My old cheap hairdryer went out on me and since I have very thick hair, I needed a new one immediately and this one had good reviews. Because this hairdryer takes so long I usually dry my hair in 2 sessions before leaving home in the morning. I do a short session to help dry my hair and then again later in the morning. If you have thinner hair, it does leave your hair shiny, so I gave it a 2nd star for that. My 10 year-old daughter has thick hair too and she usually goes to church or school with partially wet hair now. I wish I'd done more looking. I suppose I'll just have to call this one a loss. Hopefully it's not ion thing because all hair dryers seem to be that now.Oh my other major disappointment with this is the cord is SO short. I like to not be attached to the wall when I dry my hair."
4,It is still working,"It is still working, I like that. I ordered it up sometime ago for the MRS. She's has made no complaints which pleases me so Conair has done good with this one."
4,Love it but need now 220v/240 HELP!!!!,"I love this item have no complaints about it, it dryes my hair just the way i want it to do it, is hot but no burnng, my only problem is that i want to bring this blower on my trips to India, and it doesnt really work there cause of the voltage!!i got to useit the last time - i didnt really investigate about the voltage there!- so i had to use adapters and it didnt really give me it 100%; once i got back from India and i started using it here it was just awsome! i wish i can find the same one or a similar one!! PLEASE HELP i need to find the item but with 220 or 240 instead of the 125v that it is now, can you recomend any item??"
1,Never again!!!!,"I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago, and now it isn't even blowing hot air. I have bought conair hair dryers before and never will again, just because of my past two bad experiences. I didn't keep the receipt which is my own fault, but the dryer isn't even six months old and wasn't exactly the most inexpensive dryer in the store. It just turned me off when it quit working."
3,Great hair dryer but won't last long,"This hair dryer is great: it's quiet, powerful, and has all of the functions I need. That said, I've purchased it 3 times in the last 5 years. It will not last long (6 mon. to 12 mon. maybe). This last one I bought has been the shortest lived and it is dying slowly. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to look for a more expensive model that will hopefully last longer than this one."
1,Rubber fingertips on diffuser broke off immediately.,"I have thicker, curly hair, so my stylist recommended I get a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment. I got this dryer 3 weeks ago, and have been using the diffuser attachment, and kept noticing little black things on the bathroom floor. Then I realized they were the rubber fingertips from the attachment. More than half of them are broken off. I don't use the attachment aggressively, and have not dropped it on the floor. I'm really disappointed it was such poor quality it didn't even last a month. Now I'll have to buy a new blow dryer, because without the diffuser attachment, it's useless to me. And buying a new attachment with shipping is as much as a new dryer. Bad job, Conair!!!"
3,Decent hair dyer but nothing special,"My old Conair ceramic hair dryer just died after about 4 yrs. Thought I would try this Ionic dryer. I've used it for about 3 wks now & have noticed no improvements to my hair. My hair is always shiny, so who can say? But as for frizzies or static hair, I have some issues & they were not improved by using this dryer. As others have said the buttons are a challenge to not press when using. You have to hold it by the sides only. Also the high speed is not much different from the low & neither blow that much air compared to my last dryer & many others I have had. But for what I pd it is a decent dryer. Nothing special, but it gets the job (of drying) done."
1,A question for the other reviewers...,"I have never played a computer game other than solitaire, mindsweeper, etc. The ones that come with windows. But I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and was reading your reviews. You guys take this stuff WAY too seriously.Have any of you ever actually touched a girl?Just wondering."
5,The best of the best gets better,"When I first turned on Madden '04, it blew me away. First of all, it has a great soundtrack with the likes of AFI, Bubba Sparxx and Blink 182. The graphics are stunningly beautiful and the details are flat out impressive (Ricky Willam's hair, Kyle Turley's tatoos). The stadiums are impressivley detailed and the gameplay is flat-out amazing. Also, it has easy controls, though not as good as 03's.The franchise is also the best ever! And this is Madden for godsakes! The revolutionary ""Owner Mode"" is fun and challenging, for example, you can have a good team that will attract fans, but you can't be a a-hole owner like Jerry Jones. (Tip: if you give out $1 beers, your fan support will go way up. You can also hire coaches. The only bad thing about Madden on computer is that there's no Madden Cards. NO MADDEN CARDS!!So whether you're a first time Madden gamer, or you've been playing since '87, you'll love it."
4,Madden 2004,"Madden is a good game. The graphics are good, every thing is set up nicely. However, the franchise is very confusing if u don't have enough time 2 really learn about it...Even then it's still a little confusing.It is very realistic, as you can sign players, cut players. You can also create your own teams.I would give this game a B+ to an A- grade."
5,Better graphics than on PS2!,"One of the best games EVER, Madden 2004 rumbles on. 2004 is much better! The jagged edges of the players and field have been removed. The graphics are better than on PS2. Everyone else covered the basics, heres a huge pro-con list:Pros:Best graphics of any game next to GTAVCEasier to do hot routes (and hot blocks!)OWNER MODE - AWESOME! infinite power over your franchise!Create-a-stadiumCreate-a-playbook is much easierEasy 2 learn controlsMicro-Manage and Micro-General Manage your team.30 Year franshise modeReally good draft prepPlamaker control (if u hav a controller)Cons:NO MADDEN CARDSNO MADDEN 101 (only console)QBs fumble when they dive (more than real life)Hard to escape the pass rushHard to run to the outsideOverall, the PS2 edges the cpu version out by a hair but if you dont have a PS2, it is DEFINETELY worth the money. Gamecube and XBOX versions are choppier and CPU and PS2 are better."
3,Football,"It is kinda fun, but it will only please hardcore football fans. Personally, I give it a C+. I don't like the inaccuracy but if you like football a lot, this is the game for you"
1,A bad game,this game was just not fun. Madden jabbering the same lines over again was plain annoying[they didn't even make sense]! The game just got boring! You played a game and could not play it for the rest of the day! It just shuat me off[most of the time].
3,No spark,"This is my third Catherine Anderson book, and I've decided that she is an okay writer, but just okay. I think she has a talent for creating interesting and believable characters, as well as interesting storylines, but I'm often knocked out of the world she creates by the sudden unrealistic dialogue or stilted turn of phrase.This particular book had an interesting story, but a very predictable ending to the conflict. I saw it coming a mile away. And the romance side of the book simply had no spark whatsoever. Even her love scene fell flat in my estimation. We just weren't given enough electricity between her two main characters along the way. Yes, we know he's interested, but we only hear that she's interested a few moments before he confesses his love and has her naked on the sofa.And I have no idea what the title, Sun Kissed, has to do with anything. She evidently just pulled it out of the air."
1,Awful,"This is my first Catherine Anderson book, and I can't imagine the circumstances which would make me pick up another one of her books. Hoping that it would get better after the first few painful chapters, it just continued to spiral into utterly terrible writing, almost to the point of being humorous with how bad it was. The characters were so poorly developed, the plot was so flat... I don't know where to begin with where exactly it could have been improved. I am a little concerned that at the time I'm writing this review, Sun Kissed has an overall rating over 3 stars. This is certainly not my idea of a good read. Future readers, please take a moment to evaluate how much you value yourself and your time before gambling with this one. The reviews are split pretty clearly, you'll either love it or hate it. Good luck!"
2,Looking for a great romance? ... Keep Looking!,"Catherine Anderson used to be a great author. If you're looking for romance, look to her earlier (early 90's) books.If you're looking to attend a Catholic mass without leaving your home, then perhaps this book is for you.If you're looking for romantic fiction, you can find MUCH MUCH better - elsewhere. Keep looking!This book tells no real story, the characters are dumber than dirt, and there's no ""romance"" in this badly written tale. It's too bad, because there was such potential.Bottom line: Learn from my mistake. Don't waste your time with this book.It was so bad, I won't be reading any further books from CA again, ever."
3,Not the best CA I have read,"Not a bad book. Definitely not a wall banger, but absolutely not my favorite Catherine Anderson. I was looking forward to the book about Tucker, but he was so different from the past. He was really a completely different person. And I would put this book in the inspirational category without a doubt. I'm not a Catholic and if I want to read about this subject I don't want it to be in a romance novel unless I know upfront that it is an inspirational novel. There are a few reasons for buying this book. First: you really love horses. Second: you are a devoted Catholic. Third: you love everything CA writes and you would even enjoy her grocery list.If this is your first CA I would strongly advice you to try the rest of the Coulter/Kendrick series. The other books are so much better. I really loved My Sunshine.I hope that CA reaches that level again in the books about Samantha's brothers. I will give it a try but maybe, just maybe the next one is also my last one."
1,Worst I've Read in Years,"It's been a long time since I've bought a book that I just couldn't finish. ""Sun Kissed"" is so sickeningly sweet it's not even interesting. If I'd wanted a book on catholic laws and rules, I would have gone to a catholic book store. If all of this had been worked into a decent plot with more substantial characters, it probably would have worked better. However, it felt like Catherine Anderson's real purpose with this book was to convert her readers to the wonders of the catholic church. The plot, characterization and storyline were so insipid, it seemed they were secondary to her religious goal.Save your money if you are looking for decent fiction."
4,Another good Anderson book,"Great characters and nice plot. I really enjoyed seeing the same characters from her other books. Overall, not Anderson's best, but worth a read."
4,MUST SEE if your a FAN,"If your a fan of any of the HitchHiker Books you will love this. Now if you hate SCI-FI, comedy, Brit humor, low budget TV, somewhat dated tech. then you WILL hate it. I think that this version has a charm all to itself.. Better than the new movie version.""...Now it is such a bizarrely impossible coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the nonexistence of God. The arguement goes something like this:""I refuse to prove that I exist,"" says God, ""for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.""""But,"" say Man, ""the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't.

4,Excellent adaptation from book to video.,"This is a classic! Its dated look does not diminish the satire. I read the book and the characters live in my head. Sometimes one becomes disappointed with the movie's interpretation...but, Marvin, at his whinning best is exactly how I perceived him."
2,Poor Quality Recording,"This release of HGTG has two major problems. First, the quality of the video is about that of a very old movie that has been lying in an attic for years. There is a lot of video noise and the picture quality is extremely poor. Second, there are sections on the film where ""the Guide"" is talking but the sound track is silent. I returned the original one purchased thinking that it was just a bad copy but the replacement was equally as bad. It appears that the BBC used a very poor and incomplete master to generate this copy. The video quality of the series shown on the Sci-Fi cable channel is very good and includes the missing ""Guide"" sound tracks."
3,Adequate Collection of flawed but famous series,"Big fans of the late, great Adams will see this as a required item. They will also generally admit that the show was hokey, the special effects were unintentionally humourous in their lack of realism, and that the whole thing never really found its pacing. I would steer newcomers away from this incarnation of the Hitchhikers' Guide and towards the brilliant radio drama and/or books"
1,Poor Quality Video,"It's real shame that the quality of this recording is so poor. It's almost unwatchable, doesn't track properly, the sound is mushy. I sent it back, believing it was a faulty tape, but no, they're all that bad. GET IT OUT ON DVD ASAP!!!!"
1,A Shameful Waste of a Great Resource,"The quality of this tape is nearly as bad as that of the DVD version of ""One-Eyed Jacks"" (q. don't v.)! The Beeb needs to Do the Right Thing and issue a ""complete"" (whatever that might be) DVD issue, along with the entire radio series, which was The Absolute Best. This would be a fitting tribute to Adams, and they would Make Money (read the other reviews). Adams was a man of integrity and consistency, as I found out when I wished him, tongue in cheek, to ""Have a Nice Day"". I thought he was going to kill me. He really did hate that expression, and I feel guilty now about having caused him that stress. May he outsell Disney."
2,Terrible!,"I've read the books a dozen times and listened to the play a lot. All marvelous. And I bought this video. It made my heart sink actually, and now I don't want to watch it again. Actually I'd rather forget I ever saw it. But for newbies I suppose it's ok, although the budget is REALLY low. Of course it's the story that matters most, but the costumes are really awful, and Zaphod's head is by far the worst. I'm afraid people are not going to laugh at the jokes but at the costumes and props. So long and thanks for nothing."
5,"Classic, Acerbic Guide to More than the Galaxy","This is still my favorite of the various versions of Hitchhiker's Guide. It covers pretty much the whole of time and space, since the infinite improbability drive occupies every possible location before setting you down on your destination. Now that we're hearing news that a neutrino has been caught exceeding the speed of light, nothing seems impossible anymore.Not a day goes by that I don't peg someone as B Ark material, or remind myself of Marvin the Robot. No doubt the story is more well developed in the radio series, and this version doesn't have quite the sophisticated special effects of the theatrical film, but it does have the best Marvin and more time to give some of the more humorous entries in The Guide. All in all, it reminds me of the Bob Dylan lyric, ""Here I sit so patiently, waiting find out what price/ you have to pay to get out of going through all these things twice."""
4,Still Funny After All These Years...,"I originally watched this as a mini-series on PBS back in the early 80's, and found it to be utterly hilarious. It still holds up after decades, and is very faithful to the books. Brit-Humor at its' broadcast best!"
3,It's fine BUT ...,"I'm writing this primarly for those not familiar with the HGTTG - ""the story"" is one of my favourites of all time. My introduction was through the BBC radio drama as broadcast by PBS in Boston. The television show was made much later and leaves out far too many crucial plot elements. It's not bad but if you purchase it and enjoy it, please move on to the radio drama or the actual books. My favourite is still the radio play by the BBC. If you purchase it and do not enjoy it ... please try and find the BBC drama or get the book! The ideas expressed by the late Douglas Adams are a real treat!"
3,Excellent Job on Representing the Book,"I waver between rating this movie between 3 stars and 4 stars. I'm going to have to lean towards the 3 star rating. The movie does justice to the book, superbly replicating the book's storyline, characters, humor and tone. However, I found the movie to be only midly entertaining.As is usually the case, the book is most definitely better than the movie. It is much more enjoyable to read the book, rather than view this visual representation; its plot is very abstract and when replicated visually, the abstractness can be be distracting, whereas if one reads the book in its written form, it can be better comprehended and digested, thus ensuring that the humor will be better appreciated. In fact, I don't think one can easily follow this movie unless one has read the book.An O.K. movie that's has some entertainment value, however I highly advise to read the book instead as sure bet for laughs and a jolly good time."
5,call me slardibarsfart,"i guess i am old skool. i was very disappointed when i saw the new version of the hitchiker's guide to the galaxy, and i will call it drek. it did not follow the bbc series, which was excellently done. zooey deschantel did not do a very good job as trillian, she does a much better kat on the second season of weeds. this the only version to have, and whom ever did the film, ok, i'll give mos def credit as ford prefect, should be made to listen to poetry read by the vogons."
2,The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,Having been an avid viewer when this BBC show aired originally in the States we were eager to watch and savor this comedy series again. We were however disappointed to discover that quite a bit of the narration has been omitted from the video-leaving large gaps in the story. Several scenes include the video and background music but are missing the narration that explains what is ocurring-without this narration the viewer is lost. Shame on the editors!!!
4,"Not bad, not bad","I finally saw this after years of hearsay, and found it was worth the wait. My only major difficulties: Trillian was nothing at all like my concept of her (I was thinking more along the lines of Red Dwarf's Kochanski in terms of physical type), and of course Zaphod's head, which I really, really think could have been done better even considering the budget and technical capabilities of the time. The graphic montages that accompany the Guide's narration are really funny, though they're probably better seen on a bigger TV. But really, a good time had by all, except perhaps the sperm whale and the bowl of petunias."
2,Not the way to remember Douglas Adams,"This is an embarrassingly bad rendition of the HHGttG saga. The production is poor, the actors are flat, the special effects are anything but special. Rent this movie if you want to see how bad it truly is, but don't shame Douglas Adams' memory by remembering his legacy like this."
2,It's not the book,"While the book was great, the movie was somewhat lacking. I had never even heard about before stumbling across it a few weeks ago. Do yourself a favor and read the book, but forget about watching the movie."
1,DVDs are better?,"Well from the reviews I have read about the DVD HHGTTG I will sick with the VHS tape it has all of the computer audio. The tape has a running time 194 min (where the DVD is only 180 min). The sound on this tape is good, for a tape made in 1981 and re-releasted in 1993. If anyone would like to get this tape the UPC is 086162579936. The cover box art has a hand (hitching) and the green guy over a field of stars. If they come out with a good DVD maybe I will buy it."
1,"2 to the power of 7,000,000,000 and falling",Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy was a lot better as a radio show. 'nuff said.
1,A Comedy?,"Last time I checked, comedies were supposed to make you laugh. This set completely (I'm not kidding here) fails to make me laugh. The best it could do was remind me of places in the books where the same material was actually funny. This series tends to rehash exactly what's in the book, adding nothing and removing everything (humor, sarcasm, zaniness, etc) except the plot. For anyone who's ever read the Hitchhiker's books, you'll understand that the plot is nothing worth writing home about.BTW, I feel sad for the narrator, who apparently was never told that he was narrating a comedy. He deadpans like this is a children's story throughout."
4,Ahead of its time,"This series took place around the time that Doctor Who was Tom Baker. As I adore most things BBC related (All Creatures Great and Small, Doctor Who circa 2005-present, Primeval, Torchwood, Sherlock, Robin Hood), I am proud to admit this still remains clever and fresh 30 years later, which is quite a feat for any sci-fi series. When reading Don't Panic, a Douglas Adams biography written by Neil Gaiman, I learned that Adams was quite frustrating on set and late with turning in scripts at all. However, the novelty of the machine scan graphics for the Guide remain painstakingly interesting, I have to pause the feed just to marvel at the little statistics surrounding the diagrams. I was not half so impressed with the Tom Baker years of Doctor Who, though well done, these effects are appropriately absurd and improbable."
5,Wonderful!!!!!,"So full and complete that you will be impressed not only by the wonderful extras on the second disc, but by the quality of the episodes, themselves. One only hopes that the BBC will release some sort of audio edition that is comparable in its hoopiness. Frood stuff, baby!"
4,Hitchhiker's Guide still great after all these years.,"The original British version of Hitchhiker's Guide retains the wit and humor that I remember. If you enjoyed ""Monty Python,"" you will love this."
3,Decent diversion only if you loved the book,"This is a low-budget British television science fiction show that lasted 6 episodes. The quality is exactly what you'd expect, given my first sentence. I got my share of laughs from it because I've read the books a few times and THHGTTG is one of my all-time favorites. If you don't know and love the book, steer clear!"
5,Just as good as other brands.,We use them at dinner time to wipe our hands and faces and they work just fine. No fancy pictures just a napkin that I don't feel as guilty using.
5,Excellent,These are great to use. They are very sturdy and very attractive looking. I highly recommend them.
4,Good Napkins for Everyday,"These lunch napkins are handy for lunch boxes and everyday use at home. They are a step-up from grabbing a paper towel for daily family table service. In addition, the paper towel roll will last longer not using them for napkins all the time. These napkins are economical and a worthy purchase.The quality is ok for family, but go with a more expensive choice for something other than everyday fare."
1,They ruined a great shoe,"I have been buying New Balance shoes for 15 years and have been very happy with them. I've been buying the 850 series for 5 years (10 pairs) and was extremely happy with them.Now we have the 854's. Junk. New Balance ruined a great shoe. The sole is stiff and hard. The balls of my feet hurt if I wear them for walking, which is why I bought them.If you want comfortable shoes for walking or other activities, stay away from these losers!"
4,Good shoe. A little short,I think it is a good shoe for the price. It does not run big like some shoes.
3,Pretty good book.,"Very short, and written more for the ""beginner"" than for those more informed about Catholic sacraments. Has review/reflection questions at the end of each Chapter which are helpful."
4,Likeable Roque,"I saw this film as a child and as an adult tried to get a copy but this is quite difficult as the film is only available on VHS and only in selected stores. As a movie it suffers in comparision to the Liam Neeson/Tim Roth version which has excellent dialoque, superb sword fights and first rate performances by all the main leads in an adult tale. However, this Disney version is a thoroughly enjoyable children's story with Richard Todd as the dashing highlander and James Robertson Justice as Argyll. The remaining cast, including Finlay Curry give fine performances and the scenery in glorious technicolor is beautiful. The story is utter historical hokum but again enjoyable childhood fantasy where the villains are bad and the heroes are good and a demure kiss is as far as yucky emotions go! Well worth watching with your family of young kids who enjoy escapist adventure."
2,Waste of money,"The patterns in this book look very dated and are hard to read. I wish I'd saved my money to purchase something more ""up to date"" in style."
3,a clever book,"This book has several nice black and white pictures of the pieces. I particularly love the egg and ornament covers. The patterns are written long hand and can be difficult to follow if you are brand new to the art. It's good for inspirations and seeing what is possible. I'm a needle tatter, and the patterns are written for shuttle, but I could translate them over easily enough.My results are here: [...]"
4,Nice Book,"I was pleased with this book. It was a decent price and has a number of designs in it that aren't in my other tatting books. Although I haven't tried any designs yet, the directions do appear to be written and organized nicely."
5,Perfect Replacement for my IQue M3,These are also for the M3 even though it doesn't say that in the description. Fits perfectly! That's all.
5,EVERY WOMAN IN AMERICA SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.,"""CHOOSING TO LEAD by Constance Buchanan is quite simply one of the most important books on women published in this decade."" -- Karen Page, Chair, Harvard Business School Network of Women Alumnae and Executive Committee, The Council of 10"
5,Radical Grace,"The format of Radical Grace encourages the reader to pick up the book for a meditation each day. Rohr's choosing to set a particular day for the reading made it easier to keep the book handy. As an eager reader of some of his other books, I realize that some took commitment to follow through with the chapter topic. Not so with this work.Even before seeing this book, I knew that the contents would be inspiring. Years ago, Richard Rohr's email newsletter came to challenge growth in the spiritual area. This compilation lives up to the expectation of combining contemplation and action."
4,"Classic Rohr, one of my favorites.","This book is a ""sampler"" of selections from other works, not one book in itself. Some sections appeal to me more than others, but overall it's a great addition to my collection."
4,Great for sys admin,"Yes this book covers a lot. It shows you how to hack and what tools do you need. Be prepared to spend many hours reading and testing, just likes hackers do :)If you are not willing to invest many hours, stick to web site security alert and apply the patches...py"
2,Linux exposed was much better,I like the other exposed book much better. This book contains too many outdated hacks and again very little detail.
3,good book,"good book, much better than the first but lacking detail. i can find exploits on any security website. as i read from another review, wheres the beef?"
2,Not what I had expected,"This book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. I guess I should have read the title before I bought the book. I was expecting Computer security auditing 102 and got Hax0r1ng ExP0sed: your 800 page ub3r l33t guide to take you half way to script kiddie! I'm not saying that this book doesn't have any decent information, I am just saying that it's not for the guru. I could rewrite this entire book in fewer than 40 pages."
1,Whhheeerrreeesss The BEEF?,"i have been in the comminications field for 13 years now. this book reviewed like it was one of the best out there for hacking methods and vulnerabilities and i thought it would compliment my library. after going through about a third of the book, i now know it is poor. this book is nothing more than a internet directory listing for hack sites and software. it gives no detail at all. it explains next to nothing. where as i was looking for actual mechanics for attacks, to include protocols and logic, this book simply references web site, after site, after site. i would not even recommend this book for a beginner due to no depth. you could do better pointing your browser to the internet than read this book (well, the book does pretty much tell you to go to the internet). look elsewhere, even if you are looking for a starter book on the topic."
3,More like a collection of CERT advisories.,"This book is a good introduction to script kiddies, programmers who want to know about tools to attack systems and novice system administrators. It is a compendium of most of the attacks known. I did not like the way the attacks are classified according to the operating system rather than based on the bugs involved. For each attack mentioned in the book, they describe the tools needed to carry out the attack, a high level description of the attack strategy using the tools and ways to protect against the attack. However the book fails to explain the flaws in the protocols or programs that allow these attacks. I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't care how an attack works, but is just interested in knowing about various attacks. Definitely not recommended for someone working in this area or someone with basic OS knowlege."
4,A frightening but necessary read,"A thought-provoking and disturbing book for anyone whose business involves the Internet -- and that makes reading it all the more important. I've bought copies of this book for all my systems staff. A caveat, however: ""Hacking Exposed"" is a highly technical book that's not for the novice or the technology-challenged. If you want to give your boss something to read to bring him/her up to speed on information security, you're better off with something like ""Secrets and Lies"" by Bruce Schneier. But buy this book for yourself and your techie co-workers."
4,A good start for those interested in Computer Security.,"I work for a major government contract in the DC area which supports over 100,000 internet/email users. We have a highly secure network with multiple firewalls, etc. This book will not really help you secure a network but it will give you a good background on theory for detection of potential attacks. Since it is relatively cheap, I suggest that this book be added to your collection if you are pondering getting into computer security."
3,"Good for reference, but...","This book definitely contains a lot of useful information. Unfortunately, it could be organized better, and doesn't go into enough details about the concepts. It is very focused on the use of publicly available tools and information. That said, I still use it as a reference book for specific pieces of vulnerability information."
5,Excellent overview of hacking methodology,"Superb book on the methodology of hacking. It is more important to understand the way hackers think, then to rely on security tools that come and go. There will always be new and better tools. Great resource on many different topics, researching your target, OS vulnerabilities, network security, internet user security, and much more."
5,An essential book for Linux admins,"I read this book cover to cover and bookmarked half the pages with tips I want to use. It's not just a book on preventing hacks...it's full of great productivity tips as well. Nowadays, I rarely buy computer books because all the info is on the internet. But this book is an exception. The internet can't substitute for the education you'll get by walking through this one page at a time."
2,Try another 'Marvel Essential' collection instead,"This giant volume collects the twenty-five issue 'The Man Called Nova' series that ran from 1976 to 1978. Also included is an Amazing Spider-Man issue guesting Nova and a Marvel Two-in-One Annual. Like all 'Marvel Essential' titles, this 500-plus page black-and-white collection is a good value for Amazon's current price of less than twelve bucks.Unfortunately, this series reads like a poor clone of the early Spider-Man stories. High schooler Richard Rider randomly inherits his cosmic Nova superpowers from a space beam fired Earthward by a dying alien. A typical issue features Nova/Rider clashing with a forgettable villain and dealing with an annoying supporting cast of clichéd friends and family. It took me eight months to struggle through this, finally finishing it to clear space on the shelf. The series even ends without resolving the final storyline - Marvel should have included the pertinent issue of 'The Fantastic Four' for completion."
3,Nova rises and falls,"Nova began as the poor man's Spider-Man storywise which worked for the character, but as the hero went more cosmic, the fun bcemae lost and the book meanders. Artwise, there is some solid work from John Buscema and Sal Buscema. However when Carmine Infantino enters the artistic fray later in the book, it becomes more stylized, not really fitting the character. I wish Marvel added the stories from Fantastic Four that would have completed Nova's early saga, but I guess they were kept down for price constraints. Nonetheless, it's worth a read just to see how teenagers were written in the Bronze Age with lots of self-doubt and morasilty questioning while kicking bad guy's tails. Recommended, but not highly."
5,All the songs are great!,"If you like ""old cumbias"" You would love this album. All the songs are great. It's all fun! I was very happy to find this kind of music on Amazon."
1,Not for gerbils.,"Maybe for other little rodents this would be okay, but my gerbils demolished theirs. We set it up for them as a wheel in their cage and they gnawed through the flimsy plastic stand in a matter of days. They also didn't use it as a wheel because it kept popping off the stand. Totally useless. If you need an exercise ball or wheel, just get a regular one, not this."
4,Realistic,"this book is informative. It shows you what you might expect. For me, it was a review of what has happened and a quick look at what I might have to look forward to. It was a good book. It showed me that my illogical, so to be ex-wife, is not the only woman out there who cares more about herself than the best interests of her child. When do we, as a society, get real about this and do something about it? Keep in mind that the best way to divorce (even with children involved) is to be able to discuss things with your spouse and to work them out amicably. If that is not happening please, for the sake of yourself and your children, do not just roll over and let her walk over you. Read this book or a book like it, and seek out an attorney who communicates and has experience with what you are going through. It will cost money but it is well worth it. Most of all, your child will appreciate the effort you put forth to continue your relationship with her (or him)."
3,decent advice but extremely depressing,"In my opinion, Seidenberg's book had one purpose: depress the reader. How many times does this guy have to talk about the gender bias in domestic courts? This issue is no secret, and the author address the gender bias as though he was the first to discover it! Seidenberg does address other relavent topics, but I felt as though he speaks too much about cases in Virginia, D.C. and Maryland. He would have done better to address the many custody issues from a more broad perspective. There were some tidbits of useful information, but they all seemed to be overshadowed by Seidenberg's negative attitude. Also, this book seems better suited for a father who is still married but sees a divorce/custody fight in the near future."
2,Not much here but gloom.,The few workable ideas are over shadowed be the negative tone and self serving anger. There are much better books out there.
1,"Info reasonable (if dating quickly), but twisted by anger","While much of the info is correct (if changing quickly, thanks to the rise of shared-custody arrangements), the tone perpetuates the stereotype of raging ex-husband who demonizes the wife, and aims to ""win"". There's no winning with an attitude like this. And I see this attitude leaving woman after woman feeling like she has to simply shut down any attempt at communication and relationship-building with her ex.Bottom line: There are mature points between ""but I trusted her completely and gave her everything"" and ""kill"". I would read it for the raw info, but leave the emotion behind, and leave the emergency out. Divorce doesn't need any more sense of emergency.I would also recommend Mr. Seidenberg read Joan Williams' critique of child support and reconsider his notion of what child support is."
1,"Horrible book, written in a woman hating, victim manner.","(Negative Stars would apply here) I was so unimpressed by this book I actually considered calling Amazon to get my money back. (knowing they can't do that). The fathers in this book are complete victims, child support is referred to as ""gender extortion"". A complete affront to every father who wants to be a positive influence in their child's life. The paranoia and ex-wife bashing that goes on is so pathetic I would suggest major therapy for the author to get through their own issues. It's a shame that this book was written thus painting normal fathers in the same light as the extremist father wannabes that should probably not be allowed near their children due to their unresolved anger."
3,Needed a copy editor desperately,"It's hard to take the book seriously when you spend most of the reading time being distracted by numerous spelling and grammatical errors. Sure, the book may contain some valuable information, but to me, the author's credibility was diminished with his lack of attention to detail."
2,Poor editintg hurts credibility,"Although the book may contain some very good information, the poor editing makes it hard for me to read. As a magazine editor, I probably notice these problems more than others, but I find them very distracting. I may change my rating once I've made it through the entire book, but as it is, I'm having trouble reading more than 2-3 pages at a time without putting the book down in annoyance."
5,good addition to a dieter's library,"When i recieved this book off the UPS truck I was a little dissapointed in its size, about 150 pages. So I was wondering and even skeptical at the author's ability to title a book ""EVERYTHING...."" But, I was equally (and pleasantly) suprised to find an invaluable amount of information regarding losing fat and preserving muscle mass. I think the author did a good job at presenting what is pretty complcated information into readable words. I would also point out that this book could dissapoint you if you want a book that gives you a day by day menu with recipes. This book, in my opinion, is more for us pseudo-researchers with BS degrees who didnt really get the stuff the first time around (lol!) Overall, I recommend it. Its strength is its science based. Its weekess...not enough meal plans and sample diets!!"
3,Good info but badly in need of editing,"Chris Aceto is incredibly knowledgable when it comes to bodybuilding and fat loss. The information in this book is solid. Unfortunately the book is in need of editing both grammatically and for ease of reading and use. If you're willing to spend the time needed studying his advice, it's well worth your time. If you're not a bodybuilder but just an average overweight person wanting advice, Bill Phillips' Body for Life would be a better book for you."
5,Excellent,I would highly recommend this book. I have been experimenting with my diet the past 5 years and reading numerous books. This book is right in line with what has worked for me and also with other books I have read. This book should be one of several books to read if you are serious about fitness.
5,Best book on weight loss,"This is one of the best books you will find on fat loss. Its detailed enough to teach, yet written to be easily understood. This isnt a miracle diet. It describes how to eat healthy and lose fat - not muscle. It really works. I used the fat loss techniques from this book to diet for a bodybuilding building contest. I got down to 5.5% bodyfat without stripping muscle. Its not just for bodybuilders, but if you are one and you have trouble with the diet part of competing - you really need this book!"
4,Spellbinders Dies storage sleeves,"These sheet protectors go along with the Avery Durable Binder for 5.5 x 8.5-Inches Pages with 2-Inch Round Ring, Black (27275) which hold the magnetic vent covers and the Spellbinder dies."
5,love this cookbook,"I really enjoyed reading this cookbook...Lots of great recipes in a style I like to cook.. Nothing difficult ,just good food. The history provided was very interesting. Colonial food was very good at the City Tavern!"
3,"Good book, Bad restaurant","First off I myself am a chef and know that chef Staib can cook. This is a good book that gives some good history on colonial cooking. However I can not say the same about City Tavern. It was one of the worst meals I ever had. I ordered the lobster and Shrimp Pot Pie($42). It tasted like the lobster and shrimp were frozen. It was so overcooked it was like eating rubber. The whole meal was hideous for me and my wifes meal. I have to say they refunded cost of the meal and the chef sent me a sign cookbook but I will never go back. Later I looked at the Zagat review and Geno's cheesesteak had a better rating for food. On the whole good cookbook, bad restaurant."
3,Not as Good as 2006 or even 2005,"I like this short films series and I'm looking for 2008 and 2009 - it looks like they've stopped making these. I tend to pick out a couple and show them to my students if they relate to what we're doing in class. Many of these are slow. Most have subtitles. I liked the ""Mozart of Pickpockets"" the best, but I won't even show that one to my students. The only one I did is wolf claymation story. It's a little long, but it's OK. The others are kind of depressing or something about them doesn't quite sit right. I enjoyed them - they are curious. I liked the Tanto Woman and would show that one to my students if it wasn't for the brief nudity. If you're looking to try one, pick up 2006 (the one with the blue cover)."
2,disappointing,"For the most part, this DVD was disappointing. Most of the films were foreign and the topics of the films were depressing and boring or bizarre. The animated films in particular were disturbing in their content even though the animation technique was fantastic. I can't use most of them for my film appreciation class, which is annoying."
3,Good but a lot cheaper at Lowes,i found the same item at Lowe's for $16.95.This is a good product but not worth paying the price asked for here.
2,Messy,"I poured this into my toilet and it clumped up inside the jar. So I could not get in all in the toilet fast enough. I should have flushed sooner. This stuff started foaming up to the brim of the toilet bowl. What a mess! Even after flushing twice, it stayed in the toilet. After leaving over night, the foam went down. I have no idea how it did in the sewer line to kill the roots. I had to get a professional to clear the roots from the sewer line.I would not waste my money on this. Better to put it toward a professional to clean it out right."
3,Didn't work for me,"I have tried this product twice with no luck. I have a lot of roots in the line and have had the drain snaked multiple times. I have another bottle that I am going to try again but so far no go. We have had a really dry spring and the trees are looking for water, so its possible that is the reason for it not working. Hope others have better luck with it."
4,Works Great,"I have a major root problems in my Septic Tank due to nearby trees, which clogg the system too oftern in Summers. I've been using this product once every 6 months since the last 2 years and have had no problems since then. There are some other similar products available too, but I purchased it based on its reviews I read and it works great.Would definitely recommend this product."
2,Old Stock,The Roebic was impossible to pour. I had to chisel it in lumps out of the container. I then tried to pulverize the lumps with a hammer (being careful not to inhale it).I ended up flushing pebbles. I did not see any foaming action.
4,pretty good overall,"It soften the roots for sure, but it doesn't deteriorate and clear away. The website saids ""it would take up to 2 to 7 days to clear the line"" and I waited for 4 weeks, my sewer was still backing up. I had to finally rent a rooter from Home Depot to push the roots through. The product made it a easy push, if it wasn't for the FRK, I will need to pull it out. AND THAT would have been a hell of a mess. All and all, FRK did half of what it was suppose to do in ""2 to 7 days"" and it has a lot to do with the severity of the blockage. I would recommend this product for severe existing root problems but followed by a ""push"" using a sewer rooter snake. Once the line is cleared, you'll maintain it with this product. I will continue using this every 3 months to make sure the roots doesn't grow back, or if it does, this will kill it before it builds a blockage."
1,One big solidified clump,"I am not sure if this particular bottle of this product was good or not. Upon opening the bottle, the powder was one big clump which I had to try to break up. Given the warning on the bottle to not get any on your skin, this was difficult. Plus there were strange pieces of plastic-like strips mixed in with it. They looked like pieces of plastic sheeting. I was afraid to put this down the toilet. I put some in and it did not foam at all. I was very dissatisfied with the item and confused as to was this the state that the item should be in."
4,clumpy root destroyer,"I've had roots in my sewer line for years,as many others have. I've used Roebic copper sulfate root destroyer for ever and it has always kept my lines open and clear when used at least twice a year. The last time I couldn't find the sulfate at Wally World but they had one bottle of the FRK-12 by Roebic so I purchased it. I was surprised when I went to install it in the stool, it wouldn't pour out. I got a paint stiring stick, dug out the clumped material, put it in an old butter container, mashed and broke the mixture down to small chunks and flushed the stool and dumped the whole container full down the drain. Hope it works as well as the copper sulfate. Sounds as though my experience is about the same as several others. Time will tell."
1,Not worth it,i thought this would be the regular size 2# that i usually purchase for the same price...it was the small 1# bottle...wish i would have paid more attention to what i was purchasing...definitely not worth it and i wouldn't purchase this again =(((
5,Works great,Tried this after using a few other bottles of root clearing stuff. This stuff cleared the blockage and enables the water to go out the pipes without coming out the basement toilet.
4,Body shop time saver!,This tool saves a ton of time when replacing panels. On my 1970 Karmann Ghia I was able to get the rocker panel prepped in a fraction of the time it would've taken to drill. Good tool. Great investment!
1,the gastley ones,"terrible, but, hal borske was my neighbor in taos, nm and i told him i would buy the movie.....tc"
1,Terrible films by a terrible film maker,"These films are appauling. I can't understand why Andy Milligan has such a cult following, he is a total and utter hack. Sure, nobody watches a movie called ""The Ghastly Ones"" expecting high art, but these films aren't even entertaining. I love low-brow films as much as the next guy, but there is good bad (i.e. the films of Roger Corman, Llyod Kaufman, Herschell Gordon Lewis etc) and then there is just plain bad. These films fall into the latter category. Milligan doesn't even understand basic cinematography (axis of camera etc).I'm not the kind of guy who gets his jollies writing scathing cynical reviews (you can check!), but after seeing all the four and five star ratings I felt compelled to be the voice of reason. For the love of god, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE."
4,Ummmmm...gross,"This film has sub-par acting, poor production quality, and unsettling violence. Combined together they create a dark and eerie cinematic experience that is thoroughly enjoyable to a serious horror fan, not despite the low quality but because of it. It's not meant for mass consumption but if you are looking for a dim and grainy vision of terror this is the ticket."
2,Felt somehow cheated...,"The first novella (Love in Three-Quarter Time) was pretty much okay. The second felt like a joke to me because the characters were, quite frankly, awkwardly built up and the chemistry between the couple was highly unlikely.But come the third one, Tapestry, and I felt like I stumbled into a scene right out of any sane woman's nightmare. I kept glancing at the back cover and looking at whatever clues I could find just to assure myself I was still reading a romance anthology. Whatever moral the author wanted to send by the end of the story was eclipsed by the bitter aftertaste I had with the whole plot. It was more fitting as a psychological, crime-thriller... so, yeah, that's why I could only give 2 stars...and that's being polite =("
4,Should have left the last story out,"O.k. You are probably wondering why I gave the book four stars and then the title is to leave the last story out. Well, the reason was that the last story was totally inapporpriate for a collection of love stories. It was dark and disturbing and I don't care to read something like that again.The first two stories were pure magic. I found the references to ""Taming of the Shrew"" very funny mostly because I loved that movie. The first story with the private eye and his daughter is all about misunderstandings and how they can blow things right out of proportion. It was so nice to see two happy endings. The stories just flowed and made me feel like I was right in New Orleans at the ball. Oh just once I want to be able to dress up in a fancy gown. This was the next best thing. Best of all, was that the stories were short and were easy to finish in a couple of hours without taxing your brain."
3,Too Complicated -- When you just want a simple flight sim...,"Conclusion!!!! There is no good flight sim for Mac --IF YOU JUST WANT TO FLY A PLANE ON YOUR COMPUTER. X-Plane is a great software if by next year you hope to be earning your living flying. This is a very complicated program and there is no way to just fly and enjoy. I have a G5 dual core Mac with the large 20"" display -- and you can only use a protion of the screen to get the right display to see the entire cockpit etc.The developers are great people and will assist you in anyway -- but you will spend more time gathering information and ""fixing"" things than flying. ABSOLUTELY GREAT SOFTWARE FOR A PERSON WANTING TO REALLY LEARN TO FLY -- but I want to sit at my computer and just have a simple take off and landing experience. Thinking of buying a PC again just to get back to Microsoft Flight Sim. -- And Fly II? I bought it twice over the years and didn't take me long to throw them in the trash."
1,You need a supercomputer to run this sim,This program is just too much work to be fun. Unless you have a ultra high end computer with a massive amount of RAM and a massive amount of video RAM save your money. I have an iMac Dual Core with 2GB RAM and 256MB of Video RAM and had trouble getting this program to run with any of the high end scenery and graphics touted on the box. I returned this program as well as the joystick I bought. I wanted to have fun and enjoy some flying. I already have a full time job. I don't want to have to change all of the settings on my computer every time I want to run this sim. Nothing on the outside of the box gives the user any warning about the troubles of achieving the great graphics it touts. I feel just plain misled. It is very promising but the computers necessary to run it properly are just not all that common. In the end I am very disappointed.
1,Outdated flight simulator,"This product was great a few years ago, when Mac OS supported Cocoa. Now days it does nor work in Macs running Mac OS Lion or Mountain Lion."
2,XPlane Review - by a pilot,"Have used this product for two weeks now, with CH Products Yoke and Rudder Pedals, and have found it erratic in operation. Constant need to recalibrate controls (often while in the middle of a flight), the ILS instructions will inexplicably change to another airport, often hundreds of miles away, the online charts are cluttered, some control knobs can be difficult to discern (and I am on a 20"" Imac), the fixed window size (about 60% of my usuable screen area) seems unreasonably small, and ATC instructions will sometimes seem illogical and contradictory. This product appears to be seriously flawed, but that probably has as much to do with the complexity as anything else. It seems to try to do a lot of things, and accomplishes this poorly, instead of doing a few things really well. Just my opinion, and admittedly there might be ""workarounds"" for these items. If so, I haven't found them."
1,could not use,"holster was for a 1911, i had to return the holster because it can not be used to carry condition one, which is the proper way to carry a 1911.return was easy with the Amazon customer service policies. no problem with Amazon, just the item."
3,Basics for the amateur and advanced artist,"I bought this dvd before there was youtube, I was about turning 15 years old then, i must say that at that time the video helped me get a general idea of what marvel artists worked like, which i always had an interest to find out since i was even younger. Spoiler: this video isnt going to hold your hand and draw for you, like Buscema keeps saying: ""practice!"", and I did, before i purchased the video, and after i viewed it for the fist time. To me, this video is more an inspirational one than it is a how to, i say buy it and enjoy what it has to offer, but don't think its going to automaticaly make you a better artist because of it."
3,book review,Great book! Someone else had written in it - column notes etc but just in the first few pages.
3,Why must we take this exam?,"This book contains fragments of the other core MCSE exams. I couldn't even find an author mentioned on the cover. If you have passed the server exam (70-215) you shouldn't have too much problem with this stuff. Networking is mentioned but only briefly. If you'll get a lot of networking questions on the exam (you should I think, but I haven't taken it myself yet) then the topics in the book will not learn you too much..We know well the things like MMC, users and groups, remote administration, file systems and so on.."
4,Microsoft Press + Sybex Virtual Lab + Transcender worked,"My friend, who is an computer instructor at a local school, recommended that I get this book, Trancender, and the Sybex MCSE Virtual Lab. The combo worked, as I was able to pass the exam pretty easily. This book was my guide, and the Transcender questions showed what I needed to study, with the Sybex Virtual Lab was sweet because it simulated a network so I could do my lab exercises on it. The Trancenders were the most expensive part, so you might want to skip them if you're trying to do it super-cheap. Read the book. Learn group policies. Practice hands on (on the Sybex simulator). Review with Transcender as needed. Worked for me."
1,"Once again, MS Press rushes to be first out","You would think that a Microsoft Press certification book would be useful in exam preparation. Again, it seems that this book is rushed. In addition to this book being based on old objectives--there are numberous objectives that do not appear to be covered--the book also seems thrown together. It lacks any organization, and is written more like a White Paper...boring!!!!I think you will be very surprised after reading this book, and then sitting for the exam. Do yourself a favor, and wait for the other books to come out."
2,Decent conceptual overview only!,"This book provides a good overview of a lot of different material, but covers nothing in-depth. If you are going for your MCSA certification, and you don't have a lot of experiance, I would recommend that you study this manuel first, then study for and take 70-210 and 70-215, followed by 70-218. You will have a better concept of the technology on the 70-210 and 70-215 exams after reading this book.If you have already passed the 70-210 and 70-215 exams, you should ace 70-218 without any additional study material. If you haven't taken these exams, this study manuel alone will not get you through 70-218.My final words of wisdom -- if you have a fair amount of Windows 2000 experiance, skip this book altogether and take the test!"
5,Right on the mark,"Although this is officially a children's book we have used this book in adult Bible studies because of its powerful message. The pictures and the simple way it shares the story make it unforgettable. We had this book many years ago, but it got lost with all the moves. We knew we had to have a copy to share these truths with our new friends here in Russia."
5,Don't Hug a Grudge,I am 6 1/2 and this is one of my favorite books. Grudges are not nice and bring more ugly monsters like Bitterness when you hold onto them. I like this book because it reminds me to be forgive my friends when they hurt my feelings.
5,Great for kids and adults!!,"This is a children's book, but it is my favorite, simple, teaching for anybody on the dangers of holding a grudge, bitterness, resentment and unforgiveness in our hearts. Even for us adults, sometimes, the simpler, the better, right?"
5,Don't Hug a grudge,"It is a good presentation of your reaction to someone who has hurt you. You can either forgive the person,or not. If you can't forgive, you develop worse attitudes which causes up to hatred of the person. Hatredruins all relationships for many years and spreads from one family to another. One simple ""I forgive you""brings love and good feelings between people. Many wars could be prevented with this one statement."
4,"Good, Bad and well ugly",I used this book in conjunction with their web site and found it very good. The book by itself was rather insufficient however the web site proved to be the saving grace in my opinion. This book paved the way for me to move on the the JavaScript Bible (a bit more complex).This book is a Good Start for a beginner - just make sure to use the web site.
3,Not for programmer or non-programmer,"I read the reviews after I bought the book (dumb!). As a programmer, this book is easy (boring) to follow but I can see how non-programmers would have a hard time following it. I didn't get too much out of it.However, the examples were so trivial as to be non-interesting to pursue. I bought the book as a follow-up to the SAMS ""Teach yourself HTML and XHTML in 24 Hours"" so was disappointed to find that this author didn't provide examples that were XHTML compliant. And the few explanations and samples in that book were better than this whole 2nd book."
2,"Not bad, but the promised answers are not on the web!","I picked up Sams Teach Yourself Javascript, 2nd edition, because I have immensely enjoyed other Sams books. I was quite disappointed from the outset. I am new to programming and while there were in depth explanations about some things, others were just introduced and then left hanging. I think the worst though, is that all chapter exercises are supposed to have answers on the web, and this is clearly stated in the book, yet as of today (20 Feb, 2001 - book printed October 2000) there are still no answers to any exercises anywhere on the ""official"" website for the book. A disgrace!! I dont know how they are allowed to print lies like this, if it is stated in the book it should exist. Exceptionally disappointed! This book, and the author, have made me become hesitant in purchasing other Sams material. Real shame!"
1,Too bad I can't give it 0 stars.,"This book sucks. There are not NEAR enough examples, and the examples that ARE given are both incomplete (for example, giving ONLY an example of a loop instead of a complete script) and CRYPTIC AS HELL. This book should be used to stoke fires, not to teach JavaScript. It's not for beginners or pros. SKIP IT."
2,OK...And Then???,"I have a good background in HTML, ASP w/ VBS, and SQL. JavaScript was my next step. I was really getting into the book for about the first 6 chapters, and then before I knew it, I was at the end of the book. I knew all of these symbols and ""code"", but I did not feel as if I knew anything about JavaScript. If I had it to do over, I would buy a different book to get started. I am going to try one of Wrox beginner books and just start over."
3,"Not great, but not bad.","The Sam's PHP books made them my preferred publisher of tech books, this book didn't live up to my expectations. If you are somewhat competent this book will frustrate you. It doesn't provide much detail on the fundamental concepts. The last third of the book goes further and is devoted to examples that have ""cook book"" value but not a lot of educational value.It's not a bad book by any means. I think it may even be a great book, for the right reader. The right reader I think is someone who: knows just a bit about html, what javascript is in vague terms, and wants to get something up and working quickly. If have a basic knowledge of javascript already and are looking to strengthen your foundation this may not be the best book for you."
4,It's JavaScript review.,"I bought the book because it was recommended if you've been programming two to threes years 99% of what you do here you already know. There is some JavaScript specific functions and details but nothing you can not Google. If you're a novice, however, buy it!"
5,I can't wait to start applyin this stuff,"I'm a PTSD survivor w/brain damage. If I can grasp this, (and I can due to the excellent learning methods used.) Why couldn't you? The bullet that killed my friend will not take me out! Not by suicide & not by killing my joy! I'm living and growing til I die...I plan on even more after that!What does this have to do with Teach Yourself Javascript in 24 Hours? Nothing & everything.A dry tome w/all I need to know & much, Much more would tell me this is hard you can't. This book tells me this is not so hard and you can.I can't wait to unleash this on multiple web sits. Now I am confident I can do multiple sites: Poetry, Philosophy, Christianity, Humor, Radical Politics.I am now confident I can manage to build and maintain multiple blogs & sites.Whoa! Time to stop this & apply my learning!"
2,A good overview but ineffective,"I came to this book with intermediate knowledge of XHTML/CSS. I bought it at a bookstore and thought it would be an effective teaching aide. I was able to follow the first few chapters but got lost soon thereafter. The author jumps too far too soon. Even though I tried to carefully read every chapter, highlighting and annotating, I was unable to comprehend many aspects of the language and felt entirely unprepared to do the examples. I ended up reading the book once through as an overview in order to get my head around Javascript but I don't think this book deserves a second reading."
3,Just Skims the Surface,"I like to know more detail than this book provided and by trying to keep it 'light', they weren't giving me enough information to really understand the core of what was being done. I found myself struggling through the chapters trying to keep up with the concepts and ultimately gave up."
2,Not a good book unless you have a lot of time to kill!,"I did not benefit from this book much. Too much fluff... As a result it takes a lot of time to find anything useful in it. If you are familiar with any programming language at all (say Basic, Pascal) this book will dissapoint you as it spends a lot of time on explaining basics you already know. On the other hand, not enough emphasis is put on more advanced concepts such as objects, for instance. Also, the examples in the book are hardly inspirational. Buy another book and avoid wasting your time and money!"
1,Don't bother,"I usually read books reviews on Amazon before purchasing a text; I picked this book up at a bookstore, and was very disappointed. I would not recommned it, unless you like to feel that you are wasting your time. It's very cryptic and spends no time on significant topics: functions, arrays, loops etc. Perhaps, one is supposed to read between the lines?? Get the Beginners Javascript by Wilton."
3,tough book,"my main problem is that some examples arent explained. and he sort of rushes through basic stuff, the book itself is not well organized. some stuff I had to reread, and some stuff I just gave up on. So I would recommend a more basic book and then tackling this one, If you wanna buy it, get it at a discount, dont pay full price like me."
3,Motherboard issues,"When i 1st got this computer, i liked it very much, everything worked very well. Because i didn't need to used the ethernet connection(used wireless adapter), i didn't realized that it didn't work, until i tried to use it. The next thing that went, was the video card. Because the video card is built on to the motherboard, well guess what, i have to replace the whole motherboard. Sony sells it for $450. That's a new computer in itself alone. So basically, if i decides to pay to get it fix, it'll cost me over $600(parts/labor) and that just depends on who repairs it. So after spending over $1200 for this, got abt 3 1/3 yrs usage, it's basically trash now. I'd say, i would never buy or recommend anyone to but this product. I called Sony and complain, all i got was, we're sorry you are having issues, but there's nothing we can do, since you are out of your 1 yr warranty. Go figure."
4,Very nice,"Last semester I used this book as textbook, and I think it is really wonderful book! It combined molecular development into plant taxonomy, and introduced many basic concepts and methods which was widely used in molecular research, but was not familiar to the undergraduate students. However, the author didn't pay much attention on the vegetative terminology, which gives readers some trouble."
3,Not so fitted sheet,"I really like this set for its quality and found it to be quite cute. My issue with it is the fitted sheet. It is supposed to fit a standard crib mattress. Well I don't know what size they used to measure with but it in no way stays on the bed. It looks sloppy because it is so loose and just about comes off from just looking at it, let alone having my son sleep on it. I just make his bed using a fitted white sheet with the rest of the bedding, which looks fine, but you are paying to have a complete set and it was a dissapointment. Something to keep in mind...."
5,"Playful, light-hearted lesbian erotica... Very Sweet.","This TPB (Trade Paper-Back) collects issues #1-4 of Colleen Coover's beloved comic-book series about Annie and the little fairy (Nibbil) who's sent to watch over her.Unlike most comic-book erotica, which tends to be very mean-spirited and somewhat ugly, this series is extremely playful and light. The sex is fun, silly, and occasionally downright erotic!If you're looking for thought-provoking literature, this definitely aint it, but if you're looking for something fun and kinky, Small Favors is da bomb!"
1,Avoid!,"This is a cheaply-made product: The paint (which fools one into thinking that the drive is made out of some type of alloy, when in fact it is made out plastic) cheeped within a month. The hook broke off soon after that. Avoid it!"
1,disappointed,I'll keep on trying but no matter how clean my surface is I'm not able to get this thing to stick!
2,Easily Breakable,"This was a disapointment. It broke almost immediately (plastic cracked). Although, it was exactly what we were looking for & perhaps we just got a bad one, but they're too inexpensive to send back."
5,Amazing Again,"After reading this book I was left with the ""wow"" feeling. Forche has done it once again! She is an amazing teacher, as well as a writer."
3,Not as good as expected...,"I purchase this book as a guide to the Windows XP Registry. There is probably more useful information about the registry than any other book out there. That said, the book suffers from poor organization and many inane jokes.The Registry information is comprehensive, maybe overly so as there is no emphasis on what are important tweaks and changes to the Registry as opposed to insignificant details. Other sections point out many different ways to accomplish a task, but no suggestions as to which technique is the best. this book is best as an encyclopedia rather than a guide to using the Registry. Also Hipson recommends installing a second copy of XP to a different directory rather than a different partition. Bad idea! Try Honeycutt instead."
4,Interesting and Different,"Kay writes this book more for the general reader, but reading it from the Historian point of view is not altogether lost either. There are a few misquoted facts, but the good thing about this was the author's willingness to point this out in her introduction and explain why she took the route she choose. This single aspect does not take away from the whole of the story.The only disapointment I found personally were the lacking of expansions for some of the entries. She began to weave an interesting tale; and then it ended quickly, leaving more questions than answers for myself, and I would have loved to have seen more details since Kay obviously knew about Mary Todd, and wanted to give her character justice.Taken together, this formula worked successfully, and I do hope to see other novels like this in the future.-Lincoln09"
1,Ridiculous read,"I read this book by mistake, thinking that this was the book my friend raved about, only to find out later it was Team of Rivals. It is unbelievable that a woman of Mary Todd's era would have even thought about so completely enjoying her sex life but impossible to think she would have ever written so much about her feelings about it in her diary. This book was ridiculous."
2,The Bloomsbury Group,"to Emma Ohara of uk re names of Bloomsbury Group:the main ones are Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf, Vanessa Bell, Clive Bell, Duncan Grant, Lytton Strachey, Maynard Keynes, Saxon Sydney-Turner (an original member from Cambridge), also you could include Carrington, Roger Fry, David (Bunny) Garnett, Desmond McCarthy,Ralph Partridge, Frances Marshall (Partridge), Ottoline Morrell, Adrian Stephen, Alix and James Strachey. I hope this helps-they are fascinating people well worth exploring"
2,not yet,i have not yet read this book but would like to now the names of the 12 members of the blooms bury set please send it to my e-mail address
4,"Useful Q&A format, Well-Documented, Helps Clarify the Issue","How objective is this book? Very, I think. At the least, it lays out common claims and appeals and tests them with logic and cited research. It's easy to read (though some of the information is disturbing), and easy to use as a reference."
3,Galvanic 8 function machine,"The machine does what it says it is supposed to do. But know that it is a bit 'flimsy'. I don't expect this machine to last me more than a year -- that's a lot of money for about a year (or maybe two if I 'baby' it.). The light (not the Wood's lamp) doesn't tighten up and I went and bought some teflon washers to help - it does, but the light is still floppy. I do love all the 'accessories' -- brushes and such that it came with. The instruction booklet is written by someone for whom english is a 3rd or 4th language...my favorite quote was ""bald like a monk"" when talking about the metal roller! The instruction book was inadequate for me - I am still a trainee."
4,Like the pocket size,I got this book for a supplement to the Spanish for Dummies book.... it does just that. I like being able to bring this book with me so that I can review common phrases when I have a couple of minutes. I think that the book is useful and follows the same format as the Spanish for Dummies which makes is easy to use (I am not sure it would be as useful as a stand alone book)
3,More Hablar for the Tourist.,"I just briefly thumbed through this book after it arrived on my doorstep. It looks like more of the same stuff that a tourist might need on a trip abroad. I would recommend this book for someone who is planning a trip and has time to study the content. Overall, it's not a bad book for the price."
3,Just what I needed.,The book is an easy read. I didn't get to put it to use so can't really help much with whether it will work quickly or not.
3,Unrealistic yet readable,"Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni in her latest offering-""Sister of my heart"" has rendered a book that is easy to read but does not leave a lasting impression. After puttting down the book,I missed the feeling of newness and the impression was more of another-book-read instead of a special book. That is the difference between a mediocre offering and a reaaly good one. Sudha is too perfect(the writer fails to reveal any of her weaknesses). She is shown as a typical heroine of the Hindi cinema of the 60s. Too good to be true. Anju is more lifelike and her weaknesses are more profound since they are constantly in comparison to Sudha's goodness. Realism is sadly but surely missing in the book. Read it,if you have time or if you like Devakurni style but not if you are seeking a special something. This book is not in that league."
2,"Polished Prose, Soap-Opera Story","The author evokes some vivid imagery, and the book moves along smoothly enough. But the plot is straight out of the sappiest soap opera or Bollywood film, and the feminist message is crudely formulated. Every man in the book is a liar, a fool, or a coward - and most are all three. The two main women make every serious life decision as if they were 13 year old girls in the throes of their own hormone-driven emotions. My sympathy for their often horrible situations wears somewhat thin by the end of the book.Having said that, the author can turn a phrase, and she shines when writing the fairy tales that the main characters tell each other."
4,A bittersweet tale of love and loss.,"This is an amazing story of love and loss as seen through two young cousins, Sudah and Anju, who live in Calcutta, India. They are born on the same day, and are as close as any two people can be. Divakaruni does an amazing job of exploring the exotic culture and society of India's upper caste. She weaves a tale that will keep you spell bound and hungry for more.The only problem I have with the book are the last two or three chapters, and the ending is downright terrible. There are too many loose ends, and not enough answers. And I got very frustrated with Sudah's martyr complex. If it weren't for the breath-taking way Divakaruni told the rest of the story, I would have given this a lower rating. I only hope now that she writes a follow up novel to tell the rest of the story."
5,A pleasant surprise!,"I had read Divakaruni's Arranged Marriage which I thought was just okay, so I wasn't really expecting much, but this book was certainly very impressive. Its worth all its five stars!! I didn't want to stop reading after I started. I had never read a book before with alternating narrators, i thought it was handled very well. I really liked the way she portrays the central characters of Sudha and Anju. The story is very life-like, very true...there are still millions of homes in India where you can find the exact same situation. This book should certainly help give hope and courage to all those people.And after completing the book, you just can't help feeling better! The doors to happiness aren't always closed, you just have to muster the courage to open them! Good job Chitra!"
5,Magical,"This is a brilliant book. I couldn't stop reading and now that I finished it, I feel sad that there isn't more. Beautiful the way Divakaruni still seems to believe in true love. A great gift for beloved ones."
1,Chitra Banerjee is probably capable of better writing,"I bought ""Sister of my heart"" with great anticipation. Sorry it turned out to be a real letdown. I resent writing that tries to substitute exoticism for substance.Yes, the cave of rubies had me rubbing my eyes in disbelief.How far are Indian writers willing to go to peddle exotic India to the west?There is so much about India that can be conveyed without having to resort to exoticism. ""Arranged Marriage"" was very good.But ""Sister of my heart"" is a terrible letdown.The cover is well designed and thats the only nice thing I can say about the book. Its too much of a rehash of ""The Ultrasound"" for it to be published separately as a novel. Good luck with your next book,Chitra. I hope it turns out to be as good as ""Arranged Marriage""."
2,I used to be a CBD fan...,"I read Mistress of Spices, swallowed the schmaltz and applauded the style and insight. I used to follow her Salon columns with a touching fidelity--and she never let me down. And then I opened Sister of my Heart. Why would a novelist of such talent resort to the worst sort of cliches? Ruby mines? Mysterious (and scarred) drivers turning up shortly after the mysterious death of a father? A completely unimaginative take on marriage-in-India gone wrong, on marriage-in-the-US turned sour, and the final, completely predictable denouement. Say this isn't true, Divakaruni, say it was a momentary lapse of reason and get back to the kind of writing we all know and love."
5,Fascinating look into Indian culture,"This book is about human relationships set amidst the culture of India. It works on both levels so well. The intermixing of the excellent plot with the cultural mores of the country is exceptional. A good GOOD story with super twists and turns, as well as an education about the power of families and culture.Can't wait to read the sequel, 'The Vine of Desire.'"
5,Our bookclubs favorite book,"This book is so moving. The best part is the surprise ending! Amazing, usually books are predictable but this book keeps you glued. I loved the details of life in India. So wonderfully warm...don't pass up the opportunity to read!"
4,Touching and uplifting,"I actually picked up this novel for a quarter at a yard sale and I can't believe my good luck! This is a story of love all around -- sisterly, romantic, and parental. The author seems to know how to perfectly capture each one. This is one classy novel. The plot continually surprised me and left me wanting to know more. I truly loved these characters. Best of all, it had a satisfying ending even though not every piece was wrapped up. You could put your own ending to it and still finish the story fulfilled.Only gave it four stars because the story did seem to rely heavily on love at first sight to the nth degree. Sudha and Ashkok spent most of the novel madly and deeply in love even though they'd only spent maybe 10 minutes together."
4,Sister of My Heart was beautiful,You thought you knew what was to happen and then it takes you down another path. You get frustrated and fall in love with the characters all at once. I had to read it for school and I thought it would be boring but it was a very pretty story and I'm glad I read it.
4,a warm and friendly read,I don't usually read thgis type of novel but my sister raved about this book so much I had to see what all the fuss was about. She was right. From the very beginning I fell in love with the characters and enjoyed spending time in India growing up with the girls. I got so caught up in the story that I was saddened when it was over. There are some great twists and turns to the story and I loved them all. A great summer read or any time.
4,a beautiful tale,"rich with the sights and smells of the culture of india and the lives of its women, this story takes you away... and yet does not.The trials of Sudha and Anju, from their ominous birth to their marriages, make you identify with them in a way most authors can't manage. They are so foreign to me, and yet so familiar. Part of that is the author's talent for letting you know the character. Another part is the universal nature of life - our problems are different only in the details.I am, in many ways, glad that I had more choice in my life than the girls of this culture. But the relationship between them is the salvation that brings the sory to the fullness that it has. In the end, the story wasn't about each of the women, yet it was about the joining relationship they have.My only problem with it was that it didn't close out well. It's like there's a sequel waiting - or, rather, life waiting. And I don't get to view the rest.(*)>"
3,High-pitched intensity!,"Interesting, imaginative, poetic, but unrealistic. Ruby caves in the Sunderbans? Give me a break! The plot line imitates Mrs. Henry Wood's East Lynne where the wife reappears disguised and becomes nanny to the family. Poetic prose is alright in small doses but extravagance can cloy. Sudha's stories are unrealistic, even bizarre, and there is little to distinguish the characters' dialogue. They all talk the same way. In fact, do people actually speak in such long poetic paragraphs? The author should beware of a characteristic in contemporary Indian women writers that smacks of exaggeration: larger-than-life women, weak/imperfect men. It looks like feminism is finding its balance in the West, but Indian women writers have just discovered it."
2,DIDN'T LIKE IT,"i REALLY COULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I FOUND IT VERY PREDICTABLE IN MANY PARTS, SLOW AND A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY."
5,A book to be treasured always.,"I am an avid reader and I must say that this book has taken over the number one spot of all times. It is the life story of two young girls born to the same household on the same day. Anju and Sudha are cousins growing up in a house full of women in the city of Calcutta, India. Their personalities, like night and day, bring us a blend of rich and exotic culture wrapped up in the ideas that society imposes upon them. The author entwines this richness with the silent sorrows and heavy heart of the unknown. A secret so dreadful that one of the girls can never shed light upon it without fear of losing everything that she holds dear.There were several unexpected surprises in this book. The author is a fantastic storyteller and I found such astonishing insight into the human heart I was moved to reread the book just to spend time writing down quotes which I found to be words one could live by. I have yet to meet the person who was disappointed by this book. 3/17/01"
5,This book was really great fiction!!,I have been doing a lot of reading lately and have found bestsellers disappointing in this way or that. So I feel I am qualified to say this book is a great read w/ surprises and a sweet plot!! I like it even better than Mistress of Spices which was OK. I didn't want it to end!! So now I anxiously await this authors next book!!!!!!
2,A romance novel,"Be aware. And beware. This is a romance novel. Women make improbable choices in order to deal with guilt they have neither earned nor deserve and out of an obligation to ""make someone else happy."" It's a frustrating book, because the descriptions of the cousins' home in India, and their childhood and the ""mothers"" are lovely and rich. Then they each start doing the feminine ""everything that happens is my fault"" stuff and the book comes apart at the seams. As a woman, and a sister, and a friend and a wife I found the book insulting to women's intelligence and strength. There were numerous flaws, but the worst is that these two intelligent women kept doing incredibly dumb things out of ""love."" Perhaps I am too old to tolerate that as a literary devise, but I am concerned about young women who might read this and think these women made appropriate choices."
4,A great read,"Being from India, I can identify with a lot of the themes of this book - from the caste system to the importance of marrying ""well"". I very much enjoyed the book but found a few of the parts quite sad. I'd definitely recommend this book for anyone who likes books with a lot of culture."
4,Not the best but a very good read,"Easy & captivating read. Lives of two ""sisters"" interweaving through life kept me reading to the end although I could see some of the twists coming. Glad everything was left tidy at the end. Enjoyed the ride through Indian culture, myths & stories. I definitely recommend it!"
5,As Good as Factory Battery,"This battery operates and preforms like the factory battery. Charges fast, holds a charge when stored just as long and I can get 600-800 shots with this, depending on flash use (which I rarely use). I would buy another just to have another spare."
5,A must have,This battery is a must have for your Nikon D40x! There is no sense in paying $50 for the Nikon battery. This battery works great!
1,Terrible,"I bought these batteries based on the reviews. At first I thought the batteries were pretty good. They seemed to have okay life, not as good as OEM but acceptable for the price. The biggest problem I noticed was that when they died, they did with little warning. My camera battery meter has 3 bars. After 2 bars, it was time to charge the batteries as they would die rather quickly at that point. Now after 8 months, a new problem. The batteries don't last more that 100 shots. I have a grip and so both batteries are in at once. Together I am getting less than 100 shots. I probably would have given these batteries a 3 or 4 starts just based on their price (value vs. quality), but now I find them to be worthless. Save your money."
5,The best book ever....,I love this book. I read in it nearly every day. I would never be so good in Painting Digital if I had not read this book. I recommended this book to everyone who wants to learn Painter IX. This book has given me inspiration and courage to become the Painter I am today. Thank you Jeremy SuttonKind Regards
3,Painter Class,I will take this class in the fall & as always I need all the help I can get ..... I am sure there will be something for me in this book....
2,"""Paintings"" no art","The book goes in detail through the different options available, which is OK.What I think is not good are the sample ""works of art"". Sorry to say, but mostly the original photographs are more beautiful than the ""art"" created based on them. They are just smudged and distorted versions of the photographs. This makes it less interesting to read.Painter IX Creativity: Digital Artists Handbook"
5,Yes - Symphonic Live,An incredible experience. Yes have brought classical and Rock together in an exciting and brilliant way. Old and 'new' songs included. Would love to have a CD of the show for my car.
5,Its About Time,"Yes with an Orchestra?? Of course.... If you are a Yes fan, this has been a long time coming. The mix (I prefer the DTS, has the best bass range) is wonderful and the animation is a nice addition with the ability to turn it off if you like. The playing is superb (yes, I know its not Bruford, but let's face it , he was only there for a few albums compared to White who went through a lot more with the band) and the absence of Wakeman is noticeable, but the keyboard player plus the orchestra really makes up for this. For the purist this may not do, but for a real prog/Yes fan, it sounds wonderful. Anderson and Howe are totally up to the task (Jon sounds incredible although he is a little flaky on the song intros)The funniest thing is Squires Spandex pants (he still thinks he's 18.)Track selection is marvelous (Even a 'Ritual' performance Mmmmm.)New and old combine nicely here and we get the classics (as always) including 'Long Distance Runaround' and 'And You and I'"
5,"YES , Great Sound, Cute European Orchestra Women","This DVD actually choked me up. I couldn't be happier that YES has been captured in a concert that is so representative of both their past and present. The highlights include Gates of Delerium and Ritual. But all of the cuts are good. I missed Awaken and Wonderous Stories, but the song selection is so strong that I can't complain.The orchestra is filled with youthful females who move to the music and charm the viewers with their sincerity and musical competence. They wave their instruments in the air at times catching anticipations and subtle nuances with the precision of a choreographed dance team. Finally, for an encore, the orchestra actually joins YES on stage dancing joyfully to Roundabout which even manages to get a smile from the ever-stoic Steve Howe!A little over-edited, but I loved it."
5,MAGIC,"This is pure musical magic, if you love YES like i do this is a must buy problobly the best YES dvd out there. Its yust fantasic, the playing is awsome as you whuld expect when its YES and all but realy wooow this is great. Okay there is no Wakeman, but hes replace man is not bad at all, sometimes i whonder if it is Wakeman jr or somthing. Jon sings as good as he ever have, he sound fantasic and as for Squire, White and Howe they play as good as ever. And the orcestra ads some greatness to the musical magic. The only bad thing is the bonus meterial it whuld easy have fited on disc one a whole extra disc for yust 30 min extra is a litle rediculus if you ask me and they suld have aded more ather then that every thing is great.A MUST HAVE, IF YOU LOVE YES. If you have never heard any music from YES it is still very recomended becaus its a great introduction to the magic world of YES."
2,Very Nice Sound....but no energy!,"This dvd has great sound....just like listening to the YES cd Magnification. The video is just plain boring. The only ones worth watching are Alan White and sometimes Chris Squire. Jon Anderson is hopelessly annoying with his song anouncements and Steve Howe acts as if death is only minutes away. I think he falls asleep during ""Owner of A Lonely Heart"". And the creative input he gives this song is shameful. It makes you wish Trevor Rabin showed up for a guest appearance!!!!!Don't buy this for the video features or the extras, they are boring as well. Close your eyes and it is not too bad. I want to remember YES when they were young and vital and had some energy. Oh by the way, did I mention this video is boring."
2,Their Song is flat... not melodian...... notes,"If you compare their song with Lezeplin, the Who, rolling stone,slade, Sweet etc.... Their way far out behind... all i remembertheir notes is close encounter third kind ""not a actual root ofrock and roll beat.... except...""Owner of the lonely heart!!""their get it right!!!."
5,Yes at their best,"Simply seeing -- and definitely hearing -- Yes perform Gates of Delirium and Close to the Edge with a symphony orchestra is alone worth the price of this concert DVD. Production values far outmatch other recent efforts such as Keys to Ascension. While Close to the Edge is inlcuded in the accompanying CD, Gates is not. That's a real shame because it is the highlight of this fantastic film."
5,Just beautiful...,"Here is an example of orchestra and rock group that just soars!Beautifully done camerawork,and fantastic sound,plus the young orchestra members are really grooving(is that the proper expression?)to what's going on around them!A joy to behold! Marvellous!"
3,A disapppointment,"Having seen both Symphonic Live and early 70's video Yessong it is interesting to compare them. First plusses of symphonic live: sound and picture quality is excellent, recorder in Amsternam in 2001 with youth orcherstra. And the finally play Gates of Delirium which is IMHO maybe the first or second best Yes song (other is Starhip Trooper). Both are seen which is excellent. Minuses: too many of them. Very boring newer songs, horrifick Owner of the lonely heart that tells about lack of musiclal understaning of newer Yes and above all, clinical and dry performance. Especially once great Stewe Howe is like risen from the grave, playing correctly but acting like a mummy. Very disapointing, and his guitar solo is laughable. In summary Yes guys are old, a bit tired men (the only one that impresses is the singer John Anderton, otherwise band looks and sounds tired.IHMO Yessong, recorder 1974, is much better concert despite pooor sound and picture quality."
5,Fantastic Yes! Yes! Yes!,"I first saw Yes live during the Yessongs tour and later for the Relayer and 90125 tours. Great stuff but this show with the awesome symphony backing made songs like ""Gates of Delirium"" and ""Ritual"" so much more accessible to me anyway. Keyboards were mixed down too low and Steve Howe lacked a little fire, but Allen White's drumming and exaggerated accents worked well with the symphony backing. Chris Squire is great as usual in spite of tights(!) and Jon Anderson's vocals have never been better. Good viewing for any new Yes fans too."
3,well...,"as i was just trying to add another quality dvd to my growing selection, and not being a yes fan, i failed.the quality is great, but the songs arent that familiar to regular people, (dumb review this is...i know), and the lead singer is, well, annoying. extremly!sorry, no fun here... cant ""grow"" on this band, dvd will go for charity..."
3,A review without a view!,"I know a) from having been there and b) from my much played and now worn out VHS version, that this is a stunningly good concert. Unfortunately, Amazon sent me a Region 1 DVD when I live in Region 2. To be fair, they have refunded my money, but I would much prefer a working DVD. Anyone with a multi region player into a swap for this DVD?Love to all Yes fans.Alan"
2,"Trevor, where are you?","This DVD is not that bad, but it's not that good either. Lacks any real energy. Even Chris seems bored by the whole thing. And Steve Howe's guitar playing has never been so messy. Quick, get the banana peel off his guitar neck! Trevor, where are you? YES needs you!"
2,Too many disappointments,I found the DVD to be borderline good. The audio wasnt as good as others claimed it was. My sub woofer almost never came on. Jon Anderson has become so boring.
1,Jack Of All Trades Master Of None,"Good sound,lousy guitar Steve Howe has no clue how to play with a band,he has a million electric guitars on stage and as he switches from the next to the next his sound just gets thinner & thinner(even the mighty Steinberger sounds [bad] in his hands) and all hell breaks loose when he launches the Telecaster.His intonation is always way sharp and his vibrato is nonexistent along with a picky-packy scale technique results in a very amateurish sounding guitar player.""The amazing guitar styles of Mr Steve Howe""? More like the cacaphonic mess of Mr Steve Howe.The brass section of the orch. is also wildly out of tune in too many places for my liking.On the other hand Tom Brislin?,Alan White & Jon are very good.Another thing,the opening harmony vox on DONT GO are certainly prerecorded,not on!These guys need Steve Morse or Trevor Rabin."
1,A waste of money,"There are just a few proverbs, not even the most common ones and just a couple of those have both Polish and English versions."
2,pretty disappointing,"I guess I understand why this album came out last year without any mention of it on the MMW website. Half of the tracks are interesting readings of MMW tunes, from the faithful to the more obscure sample. The other half of the album is just really pedestrian house music, and while I'm really familiar with MMW's catalog, these tunes do not reference them at all. This album is for completists only."
1,Not into it at all,"This album has basically no redeeming qualities. I really could not find it more boring and if you are looking for Medeski Martin & Wood - this is about as far as you can get. If you feel like you need a twist on MMW's music, check out the remix CDs. This is a total waste of your time and money."
1,NOT RECEIVED YET,I NEED TO KNOW WHERE BOTH MY ITEMS ARE. I HAVE ONLY RECEIVEDONE. PLEASE EXPEDIATE AND ADVISE.
5,Best money I've ever spent,"I give this item 5 stars based on its price. Sure there are easier machines to use. This one took me about a month to really get in the groove with, but now it's prefection every time. My 3 year old loves to help, and even he can steam the milk (with supervision! ) so it's really not that hard. You just have to watch over the coffee as it drips down and switch the machine off before it gets too watery. I just had a second baby so I need caffeine every day! And don't have time to run downstairs to Starbucks. For the priece of just about 2 weeks worth of starbucks addiction, I have my own little coffee bar going. It's a HUGE hit at playgroups. If this machine breaks tomorrow (which i doubt since its working awesome) it will have already been worth its weight in gold. Or Lavazza. :-)"
3,Could Be Better,"Like any book on any computer subject, I found this book to give a lot of information, but it is not the only one you should have in your library on Win2000 Server. This book could have given more explanations and detailed information on each subject. It gives a lot of screen shots of ""click next"" stuff, which I find is a no-brainer -- nothing that I could not find out on my own by doing point and clicks. It lacks in real-world application."
4,"Useful & Authoritative Reference From MS, Nice CD","I planned and installed Windows 2000 Server and Active Directory Services using the pair of books on these subjects by Curt Simmons. This 1464 page doorstopper from Micorsoft Press with a 60 page index is my technical reference when I need to see the obscure options or fine details.All of the text (with enlarged graphics) is included on the CD, which is searchable. I installed it and use it to supplement the regular online help files.It's about as much fun as the unabridged Webster's but no less essential. If it were fun, I could give it five stars."
3,Bring Decius Back from Egypt,"A good book; but not the best of the Decius Metelius series. I've always liked Decius because he mixes it up with Caesar, Pompey, and his old enemy Clodius and because he's a little like Lindsey Davis's Falco - a bit of an unorthodox scamp who doesn't take things entirely seriously (unlike Steven Saylor's Geordanius the Finder who aged too fast and seems a tired old guy. Decius loses his ideals at a slower rate). Anyway, Clodius and Caesar don't appear in this volume, so although Decius's involvement with Caesar's headstrong niece (who wants to stick her nose in Decius' investigation) continues - none of the old conflicts do. Please bring him back to Rome and the people who hate him."
5,Attractive Period Drama,First of all I am a huge Timothy Dalton fan. I also adore period movies. So these 2 factors were enough for me to buy this film. Did not know what to expect but was happilly surprised at how drawn in I was by this story. I guess this is more a chick flik. But sensitive men should enjoy it too. Good acting all around. Would make a great addition to anyone's collection who enjoys these sorts of films.
1,no longer installable!,"I purchased this with the intention of using it on a Mac, and upon putting it in my new macbook pro I was told it was not installable because it was no longer supported. I am screwed. The seller did not indicate any where that it was no longer usable on present day Macs, and the return policy does not allow for software returns unless damaged, with a 15 percent restocking fee and you pay the shipping. In conclusion, I would say that the product was misrepresented, because it is no longer useable and no information was given next to Mac version, that it only runs on older macs! Sometimes we just get ripped off by people who like to not tell us all the facts before they take our money."
2,Poor Sound,"I was really looking forward to getting the second Dragon Tales DVD for my daughter. I picked up the first at a local discount retailer and was really pleased...especially for $3.00. Unfortunately, I spent more than twice of what was spent at the discount retailer and the sound quality was EXTREMELY lacking. Nowhere near broadcast quality. Even after turning the volume up to the maximum level on the portable DVD in the car, you have to strain to hear what appears to be an excellent set of story lines. Too bad we can't hear them."
1,Oh god...,"this cd is great-as a frisbee that is. Sheesh! I heard the ad and thought it'd be great. THAT was when i missed the 'kidz' singing.I bought the cd, listened to it, and returned it. The songs are great, but the 'kidz' are BBBBBBBAAAAADDDD. They totally [destroyed] the songs! You could buy this cd but it's a waste of money.C'mon. I have an older sister and she keeps me up-to-date. She says the 'kidz' singing [is lame] and I agree."
1,I am Number 89,"Hello. I am Number 89 from the Kids Next Door. We are fighting the evil force known as ""Kidz Bop"". NEVER, EVER buy Kidz Bop. It is a plot to brainwash your kids and make them MINDLESS SLAVES OF FATHER AND THE DELIGHTFUL CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!! Please believe me. If you listen to me and don't buy this you will save more than one kid's life."
1,WhAT THe hEck,"I have been listing to this kind fo music for years, weird al can do a better job than that. But would anybody want to listen to any kidz bop CDs?"
2,Leave the hit songs to the professionals!,"I heard some of the songs on Kids Bop in the TV commercial--The renditions of those hit songs were not good. Let's face it, they're doing versions of some very expensive productions from those big name artists. Sadly, they sound cheap, as if they recorded it on some karaoke machine instead of live. And only Britney Spears should sing ""Oops I Did It Again,"" not have some kids sing along to it. I know this is an attempt to make these familiar pop songs clean for the kids, but kids get into music pretty quick these days. They know every song and lyric, line and chorus, and hum to every 22-second section of these songs.I know that the KIDZ BOP series has been successful in the sales, but leave the hit songs to the professionals--they know how to do it right, no matter how good, crazy, bizarre, explicit, funny, bland, magnificent or superb that they make it. Have your kid listen to a NOW 15 compilation, an '80s compilation album or an artist's album instead!"
4,Better & Cheaper than the real thing!,"My first grader LOVES this CD. She saw it on TV and was humming the tunes all the time. Now we all are...they're fun, upbeat and contemporary songs. Some of the lyrics are inappropriate for young children and she's asking questions like ""What does Oops I Did It Again mean, Mommy?"" If you are squeamish about the lyrical content, this might not be for you. But if your kids like to dance and are young enough to think these copycats are cool, then this is perfect for you."
1,Don't buy this!,"I hate all kids bop cd's! I put 1 star but this cd dosen't even deserve 1 star!!! Kids bop cd's take great songs and make them sound horrible! I have always and always will hate kids bop!You'd think maybe the kids would atleast TRY to sound good! It's like they make it sound bad on porpose! Even my singing teacher who majored in music thinks the same!Don't waste your money on this horrible cd! Even adults should know better and most kids don't even like their songs! Don't spend your money, even litsen to the samples, they sound horrible!Thank you, I hope you don't waste your money,Nori"
2,Unbelievably funny (in a terrible way),"This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. The songs they pick are pretty decent when done by the original artists. However, I find it hilarious that kids would be singing these songs! Some of them have lyrical content of which pertains to sex and drugs.THe funniest to me is ""steal my sunshine"", which sounds so innocent, and the kids are singing with such enthusiasm. In actuality, the song is about LSD and other narcotics. Simply hilarious!"
1,Why might this be neccessary?,"Kids already have NOW cd's, why do we need this? I mean, any kid that could actually tolerate this actually listens to the radio and would rather have the actual song, not some stupid, cheap remake of the song with kids singing in the background. If you want a CD with kids singing along with it, just get a kids barney sing a long tape or something. I mean, i'm not a parent or a strict conservative but some of these songs are by artists definately not meant for kids. Smash mouth (all star), Blink 182 (all the small things), sugar ray (fly) and more all have parental advisory stickers on a couple of their albums. The only reason they make this is to get your money, and you have good reason not to get it!"
1,There is no excuse for this,"This is completely awful. Parents, please don't buy your kids this crap. It might seem like a cool idea to have kids sing popular songs, but its just terrible. What age group is this aimed at anyway? Any kid in their teens hopefully would have enough sense in their head not to buy this crap, and the lyrics of the songs aren't really something I'd want my kids listening to. Please just buy your kids the original albums that are actually produced well, with people that can actually sing. And if nobody buys it, maybe they'll quit having the info-mercials on ALL THE TIME. Thanks for passing on this."
1,shut up you biscuit heads!,this is the one that started the whole kids singing. its full house meets the brady bunch:The musical. do not buy this. buy the cd from the actual singers.
1,What a POS!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, I agree with everyone else here that this is the biggist piece of SH** that I have heard. for those who want to know who the idiots are that released this album and predecessors are. They are a label called RAZOR & TIE. Plese don't buy this for ur kids as this is not appropriate for them in the first place"
1,THIS CD SUCKS!!!,"The singing on this cd is really pathetic. You're better off buying the Now cd's, 'cause at the original artists sing the songs better. This cd is a cheap knock off for the same price as a GOOD greatest hits cd. Don't buy this crap. If your kids wanna sing along with Britney Spears or Avril Lavigne, get them a karoke machine."
1,Travesty,"The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this!"
2,Stars given only for the song choices.,"All I can say is ""wow"". This is worth getting just to hear their rendition of Barenaked Ladies' ""One Week"" - I never thought I'd hear a crowd of kids singing lyrics like ""Like Sting I'm tantric, like Snickers guaranteed to satisfy,"" or ""Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon, Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes, That make me think the wrong thing.""Oh yes, and we also have the wonderful ""Livin La Vida Loca"", a song almost entirely about sex... but hey, if we make it a bit more poppish, and add little kids for singers, we got wholesome family entertainment....Just thought I'd point out the irony in the songs here. By the way, the 2 stars are there for sheer humor, rather than for any sort of quality."
3,"My 5 year old daughter loves it, but it's not for me!","Its not my kind of music! But my daughter really enjoys it. She has listened to it over & over again. It might be less anoying if the songs were by the orginial artists. But somehow, I really don't think that would matter. I guess I'd rather listen to nursery rymes!"
1,KIDS BOP... WHAT THE F*U*K !!,"hi there, yeah i know this is for kids.. but i just have to laugh ok.. i mean.... have you heard these songs?? they are so horribly re-done, and sung by little b**chy kids with some 40 year old pyscho child molester for a singer. but at the same time i would like to congratulate kidz bop for making songs i already hate 10 times more painful to listen to. and hey you! yeah you think you're all cool with your ""z"" at the end of kids... yeah.. thats right... what!!! what now!"
4,My kids love this CD!!,"I was reluctant to buy this because of the reviews I've read, but my girls (5 year old twins) begged me, so I bought it anyway. No, its not the original artists, and the kidz bop kids only come in on the choruses, and its not as good as the original artists-- but the Cds are not for me, they're for my kids. The lyrics are easier to understand and my girls really enjoy singing along. I even catch myself singing along with them in the car. The songs are catchy and I much prefer listening to Kidz Bop than other kids songs CDs. My girls feel ""cool"" because they can sing ""grown up songs"" and they just sound so darsh-gone cute belting out these lyrics :) Kidz Bop gets an A+ from me-- we also purchased Kidz Bop 2, and are planning on purchasing Kidz Bop 3."
3,Almost my perfect watch,"This watch has all the functions I need - altimeter, barometer, compass, time etc, in a fairly small and impressive looking case. The backlight is superb. The alarm is very quiet. It is inaudible to the point of being a joke."
2,"I wanted to love it, but...","I wanted to love this watch, but after two weeks, I am sending it back. Great features on paper, and in reality the watch, chrono, and compass work well. However, the instructions are confusing, it is hard to see the face, the altimeter seems to have a mind of its own and reads inaccurately by hundreds even thousands of feet (to say nothing of changing randomly), maybe it's me but despite numerous attempts to calibrate it, I can't get it to work. Also, the alarm sound is so faint that my wife and I both slept through all three alarms. Until they get it right, I'm buying the simpler Timex version of this watch."
2,Not thrilled,"I received this watch for Christmas 2006. I live in Colorado and last weekend was my first opportunity to go climbing. I set my altimeter at the trailhead (known elevation 11,000') by the time we summited the Suunto Observer read 200' below the known summit elevation of 14,260. btw the weather was clear and sunny all day. Not impressed at all. It is a nice time piece but dont count on the altimeter."
2,Railway buff's gift,"This was a purchase from a wedding gift certificate. It was the perfect gift for my new husband, an extreme rail and bus (basically, London Transport) buff.P.S. to Amazon: There was no way to fill in an answer for question #1."
5,Sensual and sexy concert,"This is my favorite DVD in my collection. I popped in one night planning only watch one or two of the songs I like and ended up staying up all night watching the entire DVD. IT is that good. It's a great combination of songs, lighting, dancing and video images on stage and catches the mood of the audience, it makes you wish you were there. This is the next best thing, but I will go see her concert next time she's on tour. Great DVD, I highly recommend it!"
5,So Intense,"Best ever Sade comes alive on the screen you forget about everything,Her bare feet then her dancing erotic and taboo."
4,Lovers Live,"Sade is in great voice, the band is working, and there are no silly theatrics or dancers to take away from the most important elements of the show - the voice and the music. When Sade breaks into her greatest hits and the audience goes wild - whew, what a rush! Aside from the songs, my favorite part is toward the end when Sade does a little dance routine with her background singers. Classy, classy, classy!"
5,Classic!,"Great performance, sound quaiity and picture are good. DVD menus are crap and waste your time, but we have to get past that. Nice to hit play and have it going on the monitor. Classic Sade."
3,Good but not Exceptional,"I waited in anticipation for this DVD but to be honest I'm disappointed with it. While its great to see another live concert from Sade this performance pales in comparison to the Sade Live DVD. The staging of Sade Live is better, the band have more charisma and energy and the recording quality is better. If you are getting one Sade DVD get ""Sade Live"" which includes much of the material on this release and captures a far more engaging stage peformance in my opinion."
4,DVD w/DTS Logo,"Does anybody's DVD have the DTS Logo on it, but doesn't have DTS has an option for listening?"
5,"Worth getting, Sade's stylish, classy and fun","This one is a must-get for Sade fans ... her voice, poise, charm, grace and singing voice are terrific as always, and the ""Paradise"" mix is one I watch over and again...Hearing the crowd chant ""go Sade, go Sade"" and her reaction is nice to watch ... it's definitely worth getting if you like Sade. Classy, well done."
5,Sade in her element,"This is one dvd that I have played over and over again since receiving. The crowds reaction to No Ordinary Love and By Your Side is really something, not to mention all the other great songs. The visuals used in Slave Song and Somebody Already Broke My Heart were lovely....and as for the two backup vocals who nailed the ending of Somebody Already Broke My Heart....no wonder Sade exited the stage with the little grin on her face, she must've known what the crowds reaction was going to be.Let me just say that if you are a Sade fan, this is a must have and something you will not regret buying at all...the footage on the dvd of the audience enjoying themselves says it all."
5,Sade puts on a great show once again,"Sade does all the hits except ""Hang Onto Your Love"". She even jams on cuts from her latest album ""Lover's Rock"". There is a bonus clip featuring India.arie who was the opening act on this tour with Sade. This is a must have for Sade fans and funky jazz-soul music lovers alike. Awesome!!!!!!"
5,"If you're a Sade fan, you'll love this DVD","With regards to one of the earlier reviews, this DVD DOES have Dolby 5.1 sound. As for the concert, this is classic Sade. Her style and voice are so smooth, she compels you to want to listen more and more. At almost two hours, you definitely get your money's worth. Technically, I thought the camera work/lighting could have been better, but that's a relatively small point."
5,Sade's luxurious voice shines through,"This DVD showcases a somewhat new (as of the 2001 recording) sound for Sade, with slightly poppier and quicker supporting music. However, Sade's voice adapts beautifully, and she is one of those singers who just doesn't need the standard studio treatment to sound tremendous. Her buttery, chocolate lyrics come through with mesmerizing clarity on this DVD.After a few years of owning this DVD, I still enjoy and am transfixed by the wonderful editing, sound, and lights on this DVD. I highly recommend it to add to your ""chill-out"" collection. No longer the jazzy Sade of yesteryear, the versatility of songs on this long (almost 2-hours?) dvd will keep you grooving for hours."
3,It's okay,"Again, bit disappointed with the picture and sound quality. Blu-Ray for me from now on I think. Service was good tho."
3,worse than San Diego,"Same Sade with almost same band members from the legendary San Diego performance in '93(?), performs much worse in '00 MGM Grand performance.Her voice loses power, charisma and charms. Only left with her husky tone.Her band loses liveliness in this performance. Especially the guitarist/sexophonist looks much older than in '93 and plays like old man. What is worse is the second guitarist. What is his backgroud? Metal, Thrash? Intro power codes he played in ""Paradise"" is just aweful.The overall sound quality and picture quality of this DVD is just average, not excellent.Don't recommend to buy one if you already have '93 performance or unless you are collecting every album of SADE. '93 Performance is much more artistic, inspiring and attractive."
5,Simply the best,This is one of the best performances that I have ever seen of Sade. The woman left the business for some time and comes back rocking audiences like she never left. She is truly a remarkable woman with huge talent and this video concert shows it.
5,A sensuous performance,"I wasn't a Sade fan until I saw this concert video on a long flight to Paris. I was amazed at the seemingly individual relationship Sade is able to maintain between herself and each audience member. Her graceful body movements compliment her beautiful voice and alluring eyes, and her band is first rate, grinding and grooving through a long set of great music. If you haven't given Sade a close listen in a while, this DVD is a must-see."
1,Not unless it is required reading,"This book is many citings of other texts, almost a compilation, difficult to follow. The abundant citings are distracting making it a difficult read. If you are required to write a paper or presentation, as I am, prepare yourself for a frustrating task."
2,not what i expected,"i was disappointed in this book and had i had a chance to look at it first, i would not have bought it. i expected the book to explain ""inside jokes"" or ""hidden meanings"" of symbols in various paintings, perhaps point out bits in paintings i may have overlooked. it does not. the book shows a work and gives a brief description of the artist, the wrok's history, why it was painted, etc, and maybe a brief history of the subject of the painting. i am not an art major and have no formal education in art, but i didn't need this book to explain 90% of the points it made. you can learn more from a children's book on art."
1,Screw Chuck Immediately broke,The expanding jaws are okay on this but the screw snapped off the first time I used it. Very shoddy quality. The chuck can be found elsewhere on Amazon at a better price. I'd look for the one that screws onto the spindle rather than this one with the taper..... as the taper tends to creep out while you're turning.
3,Not enough to pass the exam,"I passed the exam by using this book in addition to other materials.I thought that this book was very good in providing information on every topic. I especially loved building an application from beginning to end. But if you are purchasing it to pass the 70-176 exam, you will need additional material. For example, combining this with MSDN and Transcender is a pretty good combination. I also purchased New Riders MCSD Training Guide. It provided a lot of detail and was quite helpful as well."
2,Supplement this with something else.,"I have sworn by MS Press books for all my certification exams and have to say that this one is by far the most disappointing. I found it to be too superficial to be of much benefit. It works as a decent complement to other resources, but can't really be a primary resource itself."
4,a must-read for people interested in Internet law,"This book lucidly debunks the notion that the Internet inherently possesses territorial independence or extra-legality, mostly by clearly laying out various ways that governments can (and do) enact enforceable restrictions upon Internet content and behavior. Recommended."
2,outdated - already!,"When keeping up to date with news and stories about the internet you'll just find a compact, but not to detailed summary of it all."
4,PSI MOISTURE METER,I turn wooden bowls as a hobby and this meter allows me to check the moisture content of the bowl as it dries. The cost of the meter was very resonable and so far has worked very well.
2,It worked okay... for 2 years,It is easy to use and gives reasonable readings.And then it just broke.2 stars for 2 years.
1,Jim in CO,I ordered this meter from Orchid-depot.com. The meter will not work on wood. The only contact information for this seller is via email and seller will not respond to my request to return the defective product. Do not by from this seller!
5,Worked as described,"I tried the meter on some wood in my basement. The basement flooded a little bit I tried the meter on several pieces of wood from osb, 2x4's,old yellow pine. Scrap pieces that were in the basement. The meter read the differences in the moisture in the pieces that had in been water and the ones that had not. I was even able to follow the moisture up the wood to see how far the water had soaked into it. Pretty cool. With comparing moisture reading that I knew were dry and also the ones I knew were wet I am confident it is giving me accurate reading."
2,Flimsy,"I think these are ok, but they were very flimsy, thin and light. I rarely wear these, it is not for daily wear because everytime i touch them i feel like they are going to break. The size was great though."
4,Good CD...bad cover art....,"It's like a Master P album with the cheesy cover art, but the CD nonetheless is very good."
1,Poor listing,"With all of the Sonicare products, I thought that I would find the right charger for mySonicare toothbrush. My model has no number of any kind on it so I thought theadvertised charger looked appropriate. Not so! It is useless to me as my toothbrushwill not fit in it. Wasted money!"
3,Universal Charger for Sonicare Elite,"This charger is not the OEM charger, but some after market replacement (no label on the charger of any kind). But it works well for my Sonicare Elite 9600 brush. Will see the long term reliability."
3,Universal Charger for Philips Sonicare Elite,"Quick shipment and the charger appears to function fine but not UL listed. I suspect this is a knock-off to the original Sonicare Elite charger as there are no identification markings on it and no UL listing.The original charger has the marking Philips Sonicare on the front and the UL Listed 1T26 Personal Hygiene Appliance information on the bottom.I tried to contact the seller regarding the non-UL listing and never got a response.Here is what the UL site said, ""UL is the trusted source across the globe for product compliance. Benefiting a range of customers - from manufacturers and retailers to consumers and regulating bodies - we've tested products for public safety for more than a century."""
1,"Killed my toothbrush, DON'T BUY!",I used it once. After about 24 hrs of charge time I tried to use my 100 dollar sonicare and it wouldn't even turn on. I know it charged because the charge lights were working. I don't think it ever stopped charging and killed my battery. DON'T BUY!
3,Not original equipment,"It appears to work, however, there is no product information (i.e. part numbers) or U/L certification. Even cell phone chargers I have bought that say made in China have part numbers and U/L certification. I was concerned that it would stop working or cause an electrical problem further down the line so I am returning it. Fortunately the seller has a 100% satisfaction guarantee so I'm only out shipping costs.FYI, there are really Sonicare Elite chargers out there; you just have to look harder."
2,"Cheaply made, but it does the job ... expensive.","The company not providing readily spare parts leaves some room for Chinese knockoffs to fill the void... I use the product, but it is cheaply made and turns to be expensive in the end. I felt kind of cornered after searching for an alternative."
3,Works great (but not new),Just want I need to replace the original that I plugged into a 220v outlet.I still don't understand how this does not come with universal power adaptability. All electronic items for personal use (hygiene etc.) need to be world wide capable.Anyway. The description that I brought this under said new. This item was not new. Came without original packaging supporting documentation (usage and directions) and was scratched. Definitely used.I would have given it 5 starts without a doubt if it arrived in new condition.
1,works fine,"works fine, no problems. No ""Sonic"" or proprietary names on it, so apparently imported, which had me suspicious at first. But there are no hitches and I'm completely satisfied."
4,Better than a replacement,"This product is exactly what I needed. It came in a timely manner and it looks very similar to the original charger. It works with quite a few models. I would definitely recommend it. Although there are cheaper vendors, this seller had a high rating.."
4,Happy Sony Viewer,"I purchased this TV 6+ mos ago and I'm very happy. It has a great picture! Although, I purchased the 3yr extended in-home warranty just in case. (The thing weighs about 90+lbs)There is a slight rattle in the speakers, but by simply reducing the bass it almost goes away. I plan to build an entertainment center around it, so I will be turning off the on-board speakers... There's more than one way to skin a cat!All-in-all, IMO it was certainly worth the $ including extended in-home warranty."
2,IS THIS TV WORTH THE PRICE?,THIS TV COST ME $549 US DOLLARS IT HAS TO MANY PROBLEMS THE SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT & WHEN YOU WATCH A DVD MOVIE THE PIC HAS A TILT TO THE LEFT YOU WILL NOTICE THIS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST A PINKISH GREENISH PEACE IS ON THE TOP LEFT OF THE SCREEN THIS TV COST TO MUCH AND IS NOT THAT GREAT!
2,Leupold need to redo this one,"I got this scope based of the Leupold name. I have had several rifle scopes that I have been most pleased with. But the Leupold Sequoia is a POS for the money, I have seen better optics on a $200 spotter. For less money the vortex and Alpine offer better optical quality. The Sequoia's optics are far from Leupold's usual quality, they are fuzzy at 30-60X and there is something that looks like lint in the tube its self that is irritating through the entire zoom range. Overall this scope does not deserve the almost 500 dollar price tag. Overall I'm disappointed with the optical quality of this scope, and would highly recommend another brand for the money."
4,Still using Acrobat 4,"I bought this when Windows 95 was the latest Microsoft offering. As I have upgraded my system I have kept this version of Acrobat. I thought it would need to be replaced when Vista came along but never did. Out of curiosity I reloaded it under Windows 7. A pop-up warned me there would be compatibility issues, but I ignored the message. It never said what the issues were, and I haven't found any, it does all I want to do. So I will put off upgrading until the next Windows upgrade, at least."
2,Not so great,"I bought this because it was MUCH cheaper than the official apple product. When it arrived, the wall plug side of the thing and the computer side would not go together. I ended up having to use a knife to cut the plastic power cord to the correct size for it to fit. My house hasn't burned down...yet."
2,Broke in a few months,"Maybe I just have bad luck...but this adaptor broke after a few months of use. I was happy with it at first--it's a tight fit, not loose like my original adaptor. And I don't think I'm rough on them--generally I plug in and turn on my computer in the morning, then unplug and turn it off at night. But now I'm back to my finicky old adaptor (which, despite its flaws, still more or less works three years later) because this one didn't even last six months. Ouch."
3,Been using it for 2 months and it works OK.,"This product doesn't have the same excellent design of the name brand Mac power brick, but it gets the job done. At the time that I bought it, the Mac power cord was $80, so I didn't have high expectations for this generic, less expensive version, but it has been fine.The tight fit mentioned by the other reviewers was no problem for me. I actually like it, since my battery is so dead that the slightest interruption in power will shut down my ibook. The firm connection prevents the cord from jiggling loose, but it isn't hard to unplug intentionally.I did have one problem. The outer metal ring slid out of position once, when I was in a rush and yanked the plug out. I pushed it back into place and I haven't had a problem since. Still, that is why I give this 3 stars instead of 4.Overall, considering the price, I'm completely satisfied with it."
1,new tribute (is bad),"normally i love tributes to bands, and the first manson tribute, anthems of rust and decay, was a really decent one but the new one (is bad). it has all the right songs, stuff from portrait to holywood but all the wrong bands. the recordings are sloppy and the vocals are completely wrong. i love most if not all of manson's stuff and enjoy covers of his songs but this cd is absolutly wretched"
4,Good investment,The cover of the book which I have been received look different from the one amazon.com have been shown but the meaning of the vocabulary is very good.
5,CLANCY'S BEST,"I have read this one 3 or 4 times and it has always been my favorite by Clancy. I am a big Clancy fan but through the years he has become overly descriptive and long-winded. This was early in his career and he hadn't reached that point yet. This is a classic COLD WAR espionage thriller. The characters are wonderfully written and the action is described with real drama and panache. Check it out and at the very least get chills from the CIA operatives working with the Afghan freedom fighter ""The Archer"". Yes we helped them fight the Russians. The Russian spy ""Cardinal"" is an excellent character very realistically written.Crack this one and enjoy a masterpiece of the genre."
2,way below clancy's usual fare,"It is not a complete loss, however, it is way below usual Clancy's level. Turn off pages are ones describing personal relationships in FSU (apparently Clancy does not know anything about it) they simply should be skipped because they did not add anything to the action either.Just an example of getting things wrong. One of the most ridiculous passages is related to Ryan seening a skating ring as the only place where mid 80's moskovites could have fun. Fun at the time was behind the dark windows of Moscow appartmets and it has all three necessary parts: booze, sex and excitment of playing with the danger of violating numerous Stalin's period laws which were still on the books and some of them were even enforced from time to time."
4,Incredible Book,"I have lots of Tom Clancy books, but this one, along with Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games were definitely my favourites. Everything from the characters to the description of the satellite systems was incredible, and the book was very interesting. I recommend this book to anyone who is a Clancy fan."
4,"Despite His Politics and Latest Duds, THIS IS CLANCY AT HIS BEST!","I do not like Tom Clancy. I despise his totalitarian amoral politics and I canNOT stand him slapping his readers with them in his latest oversized and underwritten door-stoppers.However, Tom Clancy was once an EXCELLENT technothriller writer. He might not have invented the genre, yet he launched it into the stratosphere.This is HIS BEST BOOK and it is actually very good.The mid-80's Cold-War atmosphere, the paranoia, the double-agents, the clandestine methods and the hardware are all expertly presented.Now, him being, well...Clancy there still are stereotypes and bigoted characters galore. Deciding to overcome this however, the reader can actually enjoy this one.Do not judge CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN based on his deteriorated career."
4,Could be dangerous!,"This is how good this book is: I was reading it while walking down the street and was so engrossed I walked into a stop sign! And my only complaint was that I dropped the book and lost my place!More techno than Clancy's best stuff, but a very good read. And, though the Cold War is now history, I read it again last year and it holds up. A good yarn."
5,STUNNING!,"This is easily one of Clancy's best works, and I have read them all save one (which I will read next). The ""Cardinal"" is a High-Ranking Russian War-Hero who has become disenchanted with all the ""chekist"" in his government. He has been supplying the U.S. with information, but still considers himself a patriot. This book provides a wonderful insight into Russia at about the time of the Cold War and still manages to provide several other story lines, including the ever-popular Jack Ryan. A MUST READ for any Clancy fan!Also recommended:Without RemorseExecutive OrdersPatriot GamesWar and PeaceThe Count of Monte CristoHarry Potter (for ""light"" reading)"
3,An adequate early work,"I read this one some years ago and have read quite a few of Mr. Clancy's other works since then. It is a very good techno-thriller and gives an early glimpse into Jack Ryan, the predominant ""hero"" in his books. I think I'll dig it out and read it again!"
2,"unfortunately, this is the weakest of all his books","While I enjoyed the entire body of this author's work, this book is clearly the weakest of the lot. There are several character development problems in this novel. In particular, I suppose heterosexuals may be naive enough to believe an intelligent woman, involved in espionage, is so foolish as to try a seduction of another woman in the way Clancy writes Bea's ""pass"" at Candy. It is simply NOT believable. This character, Bea, is a very intelligent woman as Clancy writes her. If she is that smart and that closeted, she is NOT dumb enough to take such a high risk upon so little evidence the ""pass"" will succeed. Clancy is a good author but OUT OF HIS DEPTH when writing about lesbian characters. He should stick with straights and the military where he does well, or do his homework! This GLARINGLY flawed characterization RUINS a rather nice effort."
4,Lots of Plot Twists,Very entertaining book with lots of plot twists and action. One of Tom Clancy's better books.
3,The Book Gets Better,For all you Tom Clancy fans out there tis is definitely a good book. Th only problem is that it won't really have you in it's grasp until you reach around 200 pages. So for those troopers out there continue reading becaue the book does get better.
3,"Kindle version of ""Cardinal of the Kremlin""","I read this when it first came out, and loved it.Having decided to go back and read Jack Ryan's adventures in chronological order on my lovely Kindle, I've just reached ""The Cardinal of the Kremlin""; it is still a great book.However, the KINDLE edition is terribly tacky. There are no indications when the action changes to different characters, not even a simple double-space between stuff happening in Moscow, and stuff happening in Pakistan.You really need to hire a better class of transcribers. I give the BOOK a 5-star rating, and the KINDLE edition a 2-star rating---it's not the WORST Kindle book I've gotten from you (big chunks were MISSING from THAT one) but it's right down there in the basement with it."
3,Too long-winded!,"I know just about every Tom Clancy novel has turned into some blockbuster movie, and I can understand why. All of his books are really pretty good overall, but they are too long-winded in one area: descriptions of airplanes, trains, submarines, etc. I get kind of lost when he goes into describing what some piece of equipment looks like from the inside out.However, this book was really good if for nothing else than the spy thrilling part of it. I'm a spy-thriller lovin' kind of gal. I didn't want to put the book down for fear the CARDINAL would get killed.I would not recommend this book for someone who does not like descriptive talk on transportation vehicles, but if you like a good spy story, this is the one to buy."
5,Totally Awesome - Very Well Written,"A great story line, very relevent to American foreignpolicy. It really makes one think about the possibilities.Also provides a look forward in terms of technology. It ismy belief that the technology portrayed in the book is nolonger as farfetched as it might have seemed when the bookwas written.Tom Clancy has a great ability to see the direction theworld is moving and write one step ahead."
4,The Cardinal of the Kremlin,"Clancy is the most action-packed writer I have ever read of. His settings, usually the Cold War and the Superpowers, have intrigued me and always gotten my attention. ""Cardinal"" is no different. It tells the story of the Hero of the Soviet Union and his sad, insecure life which he has devoted betraying the Rodina (motherland) to help the Americans. It tells the story of detailed spy work, interrogations, and rescue attempts. They are truly well written. However, the only drawback I found was that it had somewhat less action than the Clancy novels I've read (Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, Politika). The ending is great; it was predictable but there was a twist that I didn't expect. Once again, a must read for any espionage fan. Also, pay attention to Captain Ramius, Captain Mancuso, Mr. Clark, and Col. Bondarenko if you decide to read other Clancy novels."
5,A Clancy Masterpiece,"To sum it all up, this book is awesome. The way that the CIA handled the concept of spying fascinated me. It was amazing how agents communicated with each other right under Communist noses. The way that people got extracted from the Soviet Union and toward freedom was hair-raising indeed. The reader also gets a realistic view of a star wars system and its huge strategic importance to world peace, or war.The new characters Mr. Clancy introduced in this book were interesting people. I hated to part with them. I highly recommend reading this book."
2,Only Clancy book I couldn't finish,I am a HUGH fan of Clancy. LOVE his novels. I don't know why this one was so different for me. I found the details interfered with the plot; which according to my husband was the most realistic of all his novels. I have tried three times to continue; but i doubt that i will.
2,Hard to follow,"Too many subplots. Not Clancy's best. This review requires more words. I don't need them, but you can judge for yourself"
2,Kindle Edition is Poorly Laid-out,"This is one of my favorite novels, but the Kindle edition has been poorly laid-out and edited. There are many dropped spaces and dropped line breaks which run words, sentences, and whole sections into each other. In a novel of this type that changes scene rapidly, the effect is disorienting. There are at least a dozen instances where a missing line break makes you miss the transition from one setting to another. Simple proof-reading would have caught and fixed these errors, but it seems the publisher didn't consider that step necessary when making the e-book. If this were a free book, I could forgive them--but when I buy a book I expect someone to have edited it."
2,Yawn,How very disappointing. I've noticed that Clancy has difficulty with moving a story along. This really could have been a much shorter book. The premise was interesting but it didn't really go anywhere. Flat characters and directionless story. At least we aren't buried in technical jargon like some of his other books.Not recommended.
5,Very Scary,I was unsure of what to expect from this book given the mixed reviews.As soon as I picked up the book I could not put it down. This is one of the scariest ghost stories I have ever read.
5,HOw Could a Person NOT Find This Story Terrifying???,"A seemingly normal person who slowly stops being herself. She does nothing to bring this on and then loses time and herself. Animals who liked her start to growl, she drops a fork under the table at a restaurant , bends to pick it up and is confronted with the grinning face of her dinner companion with their head upside down!It is subtle, more THE CHANGELING scary than NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Expecting more SENSATIONAL fright may be the reason some reviewers didn't care for it. It is being made into a movie , I knew it would be! I can't wait!"
5,One of the Best Horror Novels in Years,"I have written a few horror novels, and read quite a few, and Come Closer ranks among the top few I have ever read. There are things in this book that feel as if they could happen, and that is quite an achievement in a story about something as medieval as demonic posession. I was thrown by Come Closer. Actually, really frightened. What a wonderful experience!"
2,Come Closer by,"After reading Claire Dewitt and the City of the Dead, I couldn't wait to read ""Come Closer"". Really was looking forward to a mystery and not the paranormal. I much prefer the Claire Dewitt and the City of the Dead writing style."
4,Why can't there be more like this?,"It only seems to happen twice a year for me. I pick up a book that pulls me into another world from the first word and keeps me there until the end. This was one of them - the first in a long time.Come closer manages to affect you, even scare you from very early on even though it is written more precisely and to the point than most novels. The chapters are sometimes only one and a half pages. There are no lengthy descriptions of setting or character development. It doesn't matter - you don't miss them. The author manages to pull you in in her own way.My only nitpick is that (spoiler alert!!!) you almost don't feel the main character has much reason to fight the demon. Her life doesn't seem perfect nor does she seem happy as the back cover describes. Her husband seems absent and clinical and the area they live in depressing. I could have missed some deeper meaning here though.A damn good book."
3,decent book bad ending,"I did like this book...in fact I read it in one day. Well written and easy to follow. This was the only book I have read by this author and I'm interested in her other works. Now here is the reason I gave it only 3 stars, the ending ...or should I say lack of. The whole thing goes pretty fast like it was building to some plot-twisting explosion, but nothing it goes, goes, goes and then just stops no wrap up or even cliff hanger. Now spoiler! But don't expect a happy ending, which i wasn't and was still disappointed. So I recommend reading just have another book ready to move onto"
3,A hypnotic and disturbing novel,"Amanda and Edward appear to be a happy and stable couple with a good social situation.But soon Amanda's mental equipoise is put to the strain and it is the beginning of her slow decline. It all begins with the sound of tapping she seems to hear more and more frequently, only when Edward is present. Then she is harassed by nightmares and soon she shows signs of severe kleptomania and her perception of time becomes confused. She cannot say for sure if she is speaking or if it is her inner ""Naamah"". Inevitably her psychotic behaviour is bound to lead to crime...A swift and rather stylish narrative about the loss of sanity. ""Don't read it alone"" advises The Times. Well, most readers will safely survive even if they read ""Come Closer"" alone!"
3,Modern tale of terror.....,"I'd say this is the yuppie equivalent of ""The Exorcist."" A happily married couple, more or less, comes unglued when the woman in the relationship finds herself possessed by a demon. Her behavior grows so strange that it's a minor miracle the husband suggests a therapist instead of saying ""What the f*** is wrong with you?"" It's probably because I live in NYC but I began to wonder if the woman possessed were really possessed by a demon or if this were some sort of metaphor for urban living. High-maintenance career woman or demonic possession? Sometimes, that's a fine distinction but, all kidding aside, I'd say it's because I live in NYC and not the author's fault at all. This is an easy, exciting read that holds your attention from page one and I could easiy see reading it in one sitting. Is it scary? Sure but it's always scary when the person you're married to turns out to be someone different."
2,"Interesting premise, lousy writing","When I read two horrible cliches in the first 2 pages of this book, I almost gave up on it. (""My head spun"" and ""I felt like I was in a bad dream."") Lazy, lazy. The prose is clunky and boring, more like a ""Reader's Digest"" article than anything. The only thing that kept me reading was the question of whether this woman was truly possessed or just psychotic. I give it two stars because the story stayed with me after I read it, and it raises interesting questions about the nature of insanity."
4,we all need a quicky every once and again.,"I enjoyed this book. It was short, more like a journal or a novella. I found it well written and interesting. It was a very creepy little read. I think it would be good to read on a flight. It would definately have you looking at the people around you at the end and wondering."
2,A carton of crumbs,"My carton of biscuits arrived this morning looking like it had been shipped via a war zone -- crushed and completely open on one corner. The contents were equally crushed, except for a few biscuits in the middle of each package. I will not buy these again until I'm assured that the packaging problem has been fixed."
5,Lyons Wheatmeal Digestives with port and blue cheese,"These are heavenly with a GOOD blue cheese (Stilton, Gorgonzola) and a glass of port. They are also very fine with tea. If you are less British and want an American twist they are fantastic with a bit of real peanut butter spread on them and a glass of milk.Carrs used to make a decent wheatmeal, but it now seems to be only available in the small size in the assortment box, with a bunch of other cracker types. I came across Lyons in a Tea Room in Lompoc CA when I was doing a winery tour. Then I couldn't find it in grocery stores, but fortunately found it on AMAZON."
2,"Sweet, crumbly, stale tasting","The price is good but the product is not. The biscuits are crumbled and broken. They taste like overly sweet, stale animal crackers and do not have the distinguished, nutty, wheat flavor that a good digestive should have. Won't buy these again. McVities is far superior."
4,"Great product, poor packaging","Taste and freshness cannot be beat but unfortunately, the packaging for shipping is so poor the biscuits at the ends of each roll are broken and crumbled. So if you don't mind a third of your product broken and crumbled, these are tops!"
1,Awful,"Inconsistent quality and freshness.The first time I received the Lyons they were fresh yet in pieces, we ate the pieces since they tasted good..The next shipment was not fresh and did not taste good. Complete waste of money because they are still sitting in my pantry. Very disappointing.Unfortunately I am discovering that amazon is hit or miss on grocery items as of right now."
1,Spend your money elsewhere.,"Look, i've bough quite a few books like this, to data i have yet to find a good one. If you honestly want to learn something then pick a more concentrated area and by a good book on it. Experiment, play around, ask people questions.Oh, and let us not forget the loads of stuff you can find for free on the internet. Come on, this book is just not worth as much as asked for. It's not WORTHLESS, just not worth as much.Pick up a unix manual. Read RCFs, put some effort into it."
2,Anonymous strikes out,"An odd sequel to Anonymous' previous novels: ""My Secret Life : An Erotic Diary of Victorian London"" and ""The Autobiography of a Flea and Other Tart Tales"". ""Maximum Security"" is written in a fashion suitable for reference material, but without wit, humor, or intelligence. The literary style drags the subject to a standstill and weakly supports the tenet that experiencing someone else's fear of the unknown is worth more than the price of a paperback."
4,Very Informative!,"This book covers a broad range of security topics, including some that are well known and documented and some suprises in between. A great single-volume reference for anyone new to the field."
1,Anonymous is not a hacker...,"This book does not worth the money i payed for. Anyone can write a book about computers and internet security and put in 1000 urls and 1000 computer books and tell you to turn to those resources. I so this title and all the reviews that gave it 5 stars and i thought.. ""Cool, This is a book that will help me improve my technics!!!"" Well gess what? This book is worthless. Don't make the same mistake i did. Don't buy this book. Buy practical unix & internet security or firewalls and internet security."
4,"As security books go, a good resource.","I picked this book up after a trip to New Mexico. I was told it was a great book, and I bought it after a brief pass through at the local bookstore. I would suggest this book to anyone with some prior knowledge of TCP/IP and operating systems in the UNIX and Windows families, but it has some technical inaccuracies that keep it from being a great book. However, anyone with an interest in their system's security should pick up this book as it is an invaluable resource, even if there are some errors; the locations of all the tools and utilities mentioned in the book are worth the price alone."
5,An informative interesting mustread resource,"This book is interesting and informative. it provides information about mac, unix, and windows platforms and is incredibly revileing. If gives information about what are secure services, servers, platforms. It uses the approach of cracking your own server to protect it. it also makes for interesting reading, a little humorous. Must read."
4,"Recommended reading, but avoid the laundry lists","I am responsible for a 50+ person intrusion detection mission, and I do recommend this book to my analysts -- but only after ""Hacking Exposed,"" ""Network Intrusion Detection,"" and ""Core Internet Protocols."" The first edition of this book caused quite a stir in the community, which may have been the greatest contribution made by the Anonymous author. Many other books explaining security and vulnerabilities followed, backed up by corporate-like public resources, like SecurityFocus.com. Now that security professionals are relying upon public databases, and tend to share information more freely, it's not necessary to spend lots of time reading specific vulnerability descriptions in ""Maximum Security."" I still appreciate the author's candor and courage. I look forward to the third edition, which will hopefully spend less pages cataloging exploits, while still explaining the root causes behind them."
3,Maximum Security : A Sysadmin's Perspective,"Being both a hacker and a Sysadmin (no my boss doesn't know and never will) I read this book with pleasure. It offers a good perspective on the basics of The Deed. Although I must admit, that it wouldn't be a top-shelf-starting book on hacking. It is written primarily for the admins. The information and software in the book is somewhat outdated; what is so good about this book is that is lines out basic defensive measures that any of my fellow sysadmins can grasp and carry out. These are timeless; as is the awareness it will probably give them about their position in this world. Was very amused about the Microsoft-section! If your company is based on NT, and you feel fine about it, get this book QUICKLY. And pick up a copy of Novell for Dummies on your way. For the fellow Haxors: Don't buy this book. The Phracks, the Technicals on Blacksun, or the hackers.com archives will give you much more info than these books might ever provide you with."
3,Information contained is old but still worth reading,I bought this book in 1998 and it was an instant knock out at that time. Being interested in hacking and security for a long time this book helped me alot especially the CD cotained some neat software. It also some email addresses for some nice security mailing list. But i think it would be better if they launch a new edition. The sequel to this books Maximum Linux Security ... is much better than this one. I recommend you read the later one.
1,Total Waste of money. 800+ pages on nothing (0 stars),"This is without a doubt the worst computer related book I have purchased. The author points out basic security issues and refers you to web pages to learn more. His section on cracking the root password is not even a page long- when this is one of system admins biggest concerns. If you are a system admin you'll learn nothing and if you aren't, not much more. The whole hacker motif of the title bothers me to. Whoever wrote this most likely neither a hacker or a cracker. If he is, he's either bad or been censored a lot. The latter would be ridiculous, because simple UNIX or 95 books provide more info that this book. Get technical!@!"
4,A hacker anatomy.,"Well, this book is a shock if you believe you are qualified professionals in security. Seasoned professionals may be a little annoyed knowing that stuff. If they had a measure, we have to build a countermeasure. We are back to Cold War era. At least, we have a lot of stuff to study and devise a set of policies and procedures to take in order to make our sites more secured."
2,"An introductory text, encyclopedic but superficial","A grand compilation of tidbits on Internet security. Lists many system- and version-specific vulnerabilities, along with attacks, attack tools and countermeasures. Easy reading (if somewhat verbose) as introductory material but technically too superficial to be used as a reference. It nevertheless provides a wealth of bibliographic pointers and covers Windows as well as Unix. The Macintosh occasionally gets a token mention but is not treated in any detail. Wide rather than deep (""the children's---or maybe the journalists'---encyclopedia of Internet security""), it does contain some nuggets but on the whole there are more useful books on the subject. Because of the way the book is arranged, with emphasis on specific holes and attacks rather than general principles, it will quickly become outdated.NB: this review refers to the 1997 edition and the core of it was originally written in 1999. I have not read any of the subsequent editions."
2,doesn't age well,"The main problem with this book is that it's essentially a series of links to tools. Tools are known to age quickly, and what was a useful took a month ago is now obsolete. By being too tool heavy the book lends itself to the same problem - it quickly becomes dated and useless. Compare this for example to some other textbooks which delve into the underlying principles of crypto, networking, operating systems, etc., and you'll see that this is not a necessary evil."
3,"Good Book, Not Enough Meat Though","Still a good book, and much updated. Good background information. But still only references and references... Where is the real thing?"
5,"Black, White, or Colorblind, read this book.",A provocative and extremely funny book. The only person who could give this book a poor rating would be someone that hasn't read it.
5,Funny Book,"This is a funny book! Many racist people are scared to read it, because they may learn something about our society that is rather embarassing -- the poor keep getting poorer for a reason."
1,This author is such a poseur.,He's now making excuses for the looters in New Orleans...not the ones who took food but the ones who took Plasma TV's. Puleeez. Don't buy the book.
4,Swimming,"This suit is nice, but is better for someone who has less of a figure. When I say figure I mean curves."
2,Recorded live ? maybe...but the sound is Playback...,"As one of the other reviewers wrote (""Sonically fantastic, March 22, 2002"") and I back him up:The whole music score in this dvd is PLAYBACK. The sound is exactly THE SAME as in the Audio CD; if you watch carefully you may see that both singers doesnt really sing...and the backgrund choir...well, some of them are standing still, moving there hands a bit - they don't sing.If this was the original recording than you should hear the clapping from the croud also in the Audio CD; You don't.If we put aside all the above - the sound is great. that's it. watching the two singers, choir and orchestra does'nt really do too much good...Omer, ISRAEL."
3,only a little bit good...,"because of the movement 2 and the encore (chariots of fire). The ladies singing sounded creepy and almost the entire thing was boring, i was only able to watch up until movement 4 (out of 10 movements), and the encore. The encore however almost makes it worth buying, the piece is so awesome to listen to, and you can finally see it performed."
5,I was spellbound,"The first time I saw this work on television 2001, I was spellbound. The music and visual effects were ""out of this world"". I literally could not get up from my chair although I had another pressing engagement. I felt I had found ""my kind of music"". The combination of the beautifully powerful, haunting music, the visual of the drummers, the costumes of the choir and the images refected on the backdrop of ancient Greek artifacts, and images of the NASA mission to Mars all in the setting of the ancient temple of Zeus filled my senses. As soon as the program ended, I went on line to find out more about the composer and this work in particular. Today it remains my favoutite musical DVD."
5,Greek Themed Soundscape,"Mythodea is still a captivating escape years later because it embodies an element of universal awe and soul shivering ecstasy that is enhanced in an outdoor live concert setting. Images fade in an out of a mazarine background pinpricked with stars and seem to enhance the music, although most of the images are statues.The entire concert is spellbinding in its heights, although it feels ominous at times in the depths of thunderous revelations. Throughout the first few movements there is a sense of anticipation and then the fascinating world-renowned sopranos, Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman bring in an element of emotional complexity.The Ancient open-air setting at Athen's Temple of Zeus, a 120-member chorus and Vangelis on electronic keyboards makes this an experience that goes beyond a concert and takes your soul to new heights.~The Rebecca Review"
5,"Wonderful, Amazing, Brilliant...","The concert was so exciting and mesmerising that I couldn't stop watching until it finished. I really liked the new music by Vangelis, a true genius. The picture was great and sound was very clear and magnificient especially on PCM stereo. The stage on Zeus Temple was spectacular. Oh... watching two amazing sopranos, Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman, was also true pleasure. They made the concert brilliant.As the previous reviwer mentioned, Vangelis performed ""Chariots of Fire"" as encore, which is a great bonus.This doesn't contain a liner note, which is inconvenient to know track information. However, it would be easily forgiven because the real content is really fabulous...."
5,Sonically fantastic,"This is really one to test out your Dolby Digital 5.1 sound system (what do you mean, you don't have one? Get one now!) Vangelis in Dolby Surround is an enticing prospect, but the reality surpasses all expectations. Truly galactic sound quality and size.Highly recommended (even though it appears that the concert is mimed to a playback tape!)"
5,Beware! This REALLY IS a childrens book!!,"If you want to explain the concept of robots to children, this is a good book. If you want to know anything on the subject as a teenager or an adult, there are better books out there showing better robots.I suppose that's not really a problem as this is clearly listed as a kiddies book, but look elsewhere on Amazon for truly informative books on the subject, as anyone over the age of 10 won't find what they're looking for here."
5,5 stars of stunning smut!,"Jackie Collins, how can she make so much money by writing such trashy novels that we cannot stop reading (only to mock it)? This was the first Jackie Collins book I'd read, and I was positively roaring when I read it. Chalk full of cheap love affairs and sleazy characters, it'll make you want to meet Jackie Collins if only to ask her, ""What the hell were you thinking."""
2,Disappointing!,"The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect. However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry! It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending. To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel! Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS! It is absolutely unnerving! This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know. But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst."
4,The Little Camcorder that Could.,"I had been using a 2-chip Hi8 camcorder for years, but my baby finally conked out. This machine was a godsend! Image quality almost as good, the ability to playback my old Hi8 tapes, and the digital recording and firewire output to my computer has completely changed the way I shoot, edit, and present my videos.The only thing I could think of that I would want is a 3-chip version of The Little Camcorder that Could.Whether you're an old hand, or just getting into video, you need to check out Sony's Digital8 system. The tape stock is a lot cheaper then Mini DV, plus you can still play back your 8mm/Hi8 tapes on it."
2,Unraveling is an apt title for this puppy.,"Unraveling is one of those extremely frustrating tomes you come across every now and then. I will stipulate that Graver can write. I will admit that the overall concept of the story is viable and of some interest. It's just that, for me, this thing never got off the ground. To say it is deliberately paced would be generous--plodding is another term that comes to mind. The characters are--or would be-of interest if they were ever fleshed out. The back - and - forth between childhood and adulthood irritates rather than informs.As one can tell from the other reviews, there are many who found the book absorbing. I did not. That may say more about me than the book but, on the other hand, I seldom have this reaction to a book I've assessed a bit and found interesting enough to buy.It's not so much that the book is bad, it just never seems to get anywhere. And, given what it might have been, that's a shame."
5,Did not want this book to end!,"This was, in my opinion, a beautiful, poetic, amazing work of art in novel form! I read it very quickly, then I was sorry and sad that it was over because I wanted it to keep on going. I guess that would be my one criticism of the book------it was too short! I have always found the Lowell mills to be an interesting part of history, which was one of the reasons I enjoyed this book so much. I recommend this to anyone who loves American historical fiction and prefers realism instead of just a love story which happens to take place in a previous time period."
2,A disappointment,"Elizabeth Graver's first novel proves once again that the workshop process is the best way to learn to write dull, predictable fiction. I saw the incest subplot coming from practically the first page and quickly grew tired of the main character's constant litany of pain against her mother. She also belongs to that group of women writers who seem to think puberty comes to their characters as a complete surprise, but it's not exactly a revelation to the girls who grew up on farms. What could have been a wonderful slice of 19th-century life turned out to be a therapy session in sepia tones."
1,"Predictable, somewhat contrived.","Unfortunately, not recommended. Occasional wonderfully descriptive writing is marred by a contrived and predictable plot, bringing down the quality of the book as a whole."
3,Different Documentary style but well made,"Well made, but the style may not be for all viewers. It addition to interviews with historians, reenactments, and pictures, this documentary has LOTS of scenes where the actors look straight at the camera and talk. It seems like the actors are being interviewed. This is a good documentary for adults, but may be a little slow for high school students. It is interesting but not gripping."
2,"Good advice, Bad photography",I wish there were photography books with good photography. It would make reading them a lot more interesting.
2,There are better ones out there!,The illustrations (photo) in this book are out dated. Although the information is straight-forward I think the images need to be updated.
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,"These belts are absolutely wonderful! I really can't think of a single complaint that I have about them. The design is ingenious. We actually have the red ""ABC's"" version. Of course it's made to be easy enough for kids to open and close themselves, but my son is 2 1/2 and still in diapers. It makes it a lot easier to change him when I don't have to undo a buckle. I'm getting ready to order one in the next size up and one for my 4 yo daughter."
3,artfully done,"...but not compelling, somehow. These ladies sing well together - it's a professional enough job. The recording is clean, the musicianship sure. Just nothing to write home about. The only song I really like is DON'T LOSE YOUR COOL. Sandy Cressman's solo CD, HOMAGEN A BRASIL is a lot more satisfying."
4,Great DVD for Car Entertainment!,"I bought this for my one year old. He just recently started to enjoy Dragon Tales. Although, he mostly likes the songs. He likes watching these two episodes and it makes for great entertainment while riding in the car."
4,seeing these guys live makes you..,"..wanna ask where these guys get there energy from. Billy Talent, the boys from Mississauga, Ontario. They went to the high school i currently attend (Our Lady Of Mount Carmel Secondary School). They came two years ago and i regret not going down to the cafeteria now because back then all i would listen to was hip hop. These guys are great. It also shows me that i can become a musician despite where i live. Best tracks are: Try Honesty, Line"
4,Excellent,"Billy Talent's self titled debut is nothing short of amazing. In 2003, this Canadian four piece exploded into the mainstream and they have had more success than most Canadian bands would ever dream of getting.One of the highlights of this disc would have to be the lead singer Ben's voice. Its loud and obnoxious and all around original. Its not for everyone though so be warned. As well as the voice, the guitar is great too. And the lyrics are witty and all around great, even though you have to check the CD booklet to understand them most of the time.This is one of those CDs that you can't just judge by the singles. The singles aren't nearly as good as the other songs on the disc in my opinion. Standout tracks are Prisoners of Today, Line and Sinker and Lies.All in all, this is a good CD. If you like emo/screamo, then you will most likely love this disc."
5,"best CD I own, awesome !! totally worth the cash..","I can't get enough!!! BT is great, They have a great sound and are extremely talented. They really have that garage band feel. A word of caution, if you dislike it when Ben screams then don't buy the album, because there's screaming in every song. They are also really great live."
2,Billy Talentless,"I bought this cd listened to it and almost threw it in the garbage.... if it wasnt for the really cool guitar playing and the semi good drumming i would have...The lead singers voice annoys me.. i cannot get over it... i do not beleive he is a ""Hardcore"" singer i think he just trys to sound like every other emo band out there and he adds a touch to it... their songs have not evolved from other emo and it overall should not be purchased unless your wanting to hear Simple Plan on Steroids..."
5,Different and good,"I was little apprehensive when I first heard Try Honesty.After hearing Try Honesty a few times I was in a certain music store and listened to the first track. As soon as I heard the first guitar riff I new I would like this album.The style is definitely refreshing with solid vocals, instruments and screaming. Not hardcore unintelligible screaming and not quite an emo scream.It's new and I like it a lot."
4,Unique,"This type of music is very unique. This is not a bad thing though, i like this album a lot. The only song i skip is ""Standing In The Rain"". My favorate songs are ""Try Honesty"", ""River Below"", ""The EX"" and ""Line and Sinker"".I cannot put this music into 1 category, but overal most would say its punk but it gets heavy and you can get a little bit of metal in some of there screaming chorus'and heavy riff's. You can even get a little sprinkle of rap in this with some of the verses."
1,The worst thing ever.,"I have difficulty believing that I paid for this horrible cd. I could have written better lyrics in my sleep... when I was 2. For the love of all things holy, don't waste your time."
5,This album is good.,"This is a great CD, with the exception of Cut The Curtains. That song is not so good....But the rest of the album is amazing.Best songs on the CD:River Below, The Ex, Lies, Nothing to Lose, Line and SinkerToo bad the song Beach Balls wasn't on the album.And the guy below me can suck it as well.BILLY TALENT IS NOT PUNK!!!!!!People who say that, obviously do not know what punk is."
5,nothing to loose,Billy Talent is a great band. i don't know if you would call it screaming. it's just great. like high pitched yelling at some parts in songs. you should listen to Billy Talent for motivation. its crazy vocals and cool fast music.
3,It's Good!,"Ok after reading the reviews, I thought I should write my own. I'm 10 years out of High School and I have a decent CD collection (Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Pink Floyd, Neil Young, Soundgarden, etc.). I know with Billy Talent there's no middle ground because of the voice, so I respect every review.I like the voice and I gotta say this is a good CD. There's two things I really like about the album:1) It's original. To many new bands rip off Pearl Jam or Green Day. Love 'em or hate 'em, Billy Talent does their own thing. I like that about bands.2) Every song sounds different. Besides Nothing to Lose, the album is pretty much the same tempo, but no two songs sound the same.If you can stand the voice, buy this CD. If you don't like the voice, then buy something else."
2,one hit wonderous,"When I first heard ""Try Honesty"", I was enamored. So much passion. Very unique. Incredibly catchy. What happened on the rest of the album? It sounds like too many other albums with one song written for the radio/MTV then the others were just filler. It makes you wonder if they even wrote ""Try Honesty"". A bit harsh, I know, but whatever happened to bands writing entire albums you could listen to?"
3,Whoever said that about incubus(that their a sorry excuse),"Incubus has more talent then billy talent will ever have. billy talent has produced 1 cd with generic bass and guitar riffs and catchy choruses. Wow. Jump on the Bandwagon. Incubus has created 5 unique CDS, and most sound different from the previous and they all sound good.(except for morning view and a crow left of the murder even though i still think they sound good too). wow you want to know what thats called? talent. Heh, sorry i rambled."
1,ughh,"the fact that someone told me that ""punk rock"" sucked bsed on this cd is disgusting... all these new bands are the same and they all suck you ignorant fools"
5,Album of the Year?,"What a day, what a day!... I received this on the same day as the new Thursday album expecting to get 2 amazing albums, well I only got one, and this is it.Having seen the video for 'Try Honesty' I knew this was a band worth checking out and I was right. Every song on it is very strong, there simply is no filler on here it's all top class emo/punk/post-hardcore blah blah blah you get the picture.If you liked 'Try Honesty' that is good advert for the album, it is one of the best songs on the album but the rest are just as strong, basically just buy it!!"
4,Converted,"Just saw these cats live with Alexisonfire. In all honesty, I think the song Try Honesty is pretty bad...but I went into the show with an open mind. It was a rockin' show. The joint was packed, the crowd was thrilled and Billy Talent was on fire. If the album is anything like the concert (and i'm going to bet it is) get ready to drop some cash on this disc--it's sure to be well worth it!"
3,"Pretty Good, but not very deep","I bought this book and I did find it very helpfull in understanding the basic concepts behind 3D graphics. It even has little code snippits here and there, but not a lot of them. I was dissapointed though, at the lack of any real algorithims or practical applications found in the book. It is more of a summary of 3D theory then a real guide. I think this book would be best used as a companion along with a more in-depth book, so you could refer to this one when the more complicated book gets confusing."
4,THE book for beginners,This is an exlenet book if u starting out with computer graphics. It takes you through the basic principles of CG and rasterezation of primitives and only than goes into 3d. But if you are looking for some cool GI and NURBS programming techniques this isn't the book for you. This book does it's job well
3,Lots of math and details - does it make my life easier?,"I don't know about this book. I has a CD with it, but I've bearly used it in 4 years. Some reviewers love it. It is definitely not fluff. Lots of math, and well written. BUT it's about OpenGL and a bit about Direct3D. BUT I've found gaming coding books which are much more readable, 10x more useful at the same price (see any of Andre' LeMothe's books."
4,A good 3D Graphics Programming Resource,"3D Graphics Programming: Games & Beyond, is an in depth look at the world of 3D Programming if you are just interested in creating 3D graphics for video games or just to pass some time. However, it is not just a great book for the graphics programming rookie, this book is also a great source for intermediate and advanced programmers. I highly recommend this title for young programmers."
4,Excellent espresso machine value,Krups Gusto espresso maker has many features found in more expensive machines. Makes great espresso and frother does a great job of frothing milk for a real cafe experience. The price of the unit coupled with its great quality make it a deal that shouldn't be passed up.
4,Warning: Espresso is addictive,"I purchased this model (new not refurb) about a year ago, and I'm already itching for a bigger badder model. This is an outstanding model to get your feet wet, see if you like the idea of making your own espresso drinks. Originally I bought this to save a few bucks making my own instead of heading to a trendy overprised espresso bar, and it's brought me nothing but joy.However heed my warning, you could become addicted and need espresso the rest of your life!"
4,Useful for Replication,"It would have been better if the author has addressed the common problems faced during replication, how to detect them and solve them. Otherwise a good book. Many packages have changed in Oracle 8i. Better wait till the next release covering 8i is out in the market."
3,"well written, but badly out of date","Well written and useful, but badly out of date. In spite of the claim that is updated for 8 and 8i, it's not there."
5,Bone Crushing Implement of Destruction,Works great as described and how you would expect. Saves time and mess. Safe to use. We like it.
1,Good product except,"I almost did not purchase the shears because of the review that said it does not cut skin. But, I'm glad I did. It cuts skin quite nicely as long as you use the front end of the shears.The problem I'm having is that they come apart when I don't want them to - usually when I'm trying to open them wide enough to cut through the bone of a chicken thigh [which I do often] and when I'm cleaning them. I am afraid I'm going to lose the little black ring and they will then not work.But they do a great job cutting through the bones - MUCH better than any of the other poulty shears I've tried.July 15, 2012I am downgrading my review of this product. It is losing it's ability to cut easily and the little silver spring piece has broken off. I've only had the item for just over a month and I am hoping I can obtain a refund so I can replace it."
1,You Get What You Pay For . . .,"I bought these sheers to butterfly whole chickens (remove the backbone). Used them yesterday and was a little disappointed. Really not much easier than a knife...but probably 100% safer. They just don't seem that sharp. You have to position the scissors just right to get maximum torque. Probably the only item I've ever ordered from Amazon that hasn't absolutely delighted me. Now, if you're not butterflying chickens...just using them to cut parts for example, they may be just fine.EDIT: I ended up throwing these away. They broke while butterflying a chicken...exactly what they're designed to do, I'd think. I'm going to stick with a butcher knife. If you buy poultry shears, but the best or don't buy 'em."
1,Don't buy,"I really read and tried to check out these Poultry Shears. They had good reviews.What a waste of money!!! They already broke. They did not even last 30 days. I feed my dogs raw so I need good shears. Now I have to save up to buy another pair. Unless you just want to have these in a drawer ""Please do not waste your money"". I will think twice before I ever buy any product from OXO GOOD GRIPS again."
4,Handy tool,"Guess I watch too much Food Network, after seeing Guy cut out a chicken back bone and now it lays flat, got to have this one in the kitchen, and Amazon wasted no time getting to me..."
5,The Title Says It All,"""Sunday music"" it definitely is--at least it was, back when church music was spiritual, elevating, and interesting. My father is a retired church organist, and listening to this CD brought back a lot of fond memories of sitting in the choir loft, watching Dad at the console making blissful music. I grew up hearing this kind of stuff every week--I didn't realize how lucky I was till I got out in the big bad world and found out how dreary and mundane the music is at most churches! Judith Hancock employs a straight-ahead but accomplished technique to bring listeners some authentic church music that is not as often recorded as the big, blockbuster pieces. I would like to see more CDs like this on the market, since you can't get good music like this at church anymore."
4,Consider yourself,"These ""games"" offer alot of enjoyment and knowledge.Fun to watch with another person, too.You will be surprised and amazed with what you find out!"
4,"Fun stuff, but not deep","Silly intro to neuropsychology, which is quite glamorous & has at most a page of actual information. Good for sparking interest in the subjects & getting a few key concepts.I actually found the special feature ""How to Build a Beating Heart"" much more worthwhile than the main feature! It talks about the problem of scarring, the varying complexities of different organs & tissues, & the potential of ExtraCellular Matrix (ECM)."
2,Less than engaging,"I find psychology and the brain very interesting and I don't mind hearing about things I have already learned. I did not expect to be bowled over with a lot of new information but I did expect brain games to be interesting and fun. Instead the narrator/host was a drag and the lame mind games were a drag. Albeit there were lots of colors, magic tricks, and men in monkey suits but all of that was just fluff. The program is informative but the way it is presented is a turn off. The secret life of the brain, although from 2002 and less current, is an interesting program."
1,This is not my favorite documentary on the brain,"Basically this DVD shows how easy it is to fool people who are not concentrating on what is going on around them. If you really want to learn more about the brain, I recommend the DVDs Secrets of the Mind from NOVA and How Does the Brain Work? from NOVA Science Now."
4,use with supervision,"Don't buy this for a zhu=zhu pet - it't won't work. It does work for a real hamster wonderfully though. As with any toy your hamster is playing with outside of his cage - you must supervise him. If the cage falls down some stairs and opens his little feet can be broken - or worse. And yes if you have a cat or dog and the ball comes open he may become food. MAKE SURE IT IS CLOSED TIGHTLY! That being said, the hamster running in the ball is fun for him. Yes, they have poor eye sight but it gives them a chance to explore and run in more than just one direction. If it was torture (like the other poster commented) the hamster would not WANT to go in it. Mine loves it. Sometimes I make it as a turn in a maze I set up for him - and he climbs right in and starts running before I can get it all closed up!"
3,Ultimate Flagpole,"The flagpole arrived in a very reasonable timeframe. It was not what I thought it was supposed to be, however, I did look at several and may have remembered the wrong base support mechanism. My challenge is that the flagpole is MUCH smaller in diameter than the base support is, and is so thin that when I hand tightened the thumbscrew, in order to prevent the flagpole from being very wabbly, the thumbscrew perforated the flagpole. I have since had to go to Home Depot to purchase something to assist holding the flagpole in place."
1,Crap,"Stopped working without warning... sort of thing you find out only when your nice, large, expensive lamb roast is totally overdone. Its principal virtue is its price, but you get what you pay for. It is a matter of some irony Taylor calls this the ""connoisseur line."" One wonders what they'd produce as the ""value line."""
1,Unreliable,"This thermometer has not worked well since we got it. The meat will not register as done and will be overcooked. Did not purchase through amazon, but had to review the product. I will now be looking for a digital thermometer."
4,worked fine,Part fit and worked fine. Too bad it stopped snowing and I did not need to use the snow blower again ;-)
5,What's Not to Like About Any Tim McCoy Movie?,"Granted, Col. Tim McCoy made a boatload of B westerns across his career. But he was always the handsome hero, wearing a ten (or twenty) gallon hat bigger than Hedda Hopper's. He was particularly graceful in the saddle and had a clever habit of twirling his guns as he reholstered them. This Tim McCoy film has only recently been re-released. A collector's find for sure!"
5,Book review,This is a great source book for anyone looking to increase their knowledge about California's archeology and those who made it. Definitely worth reading.
5,A wonderful well-written love story and socialist primer.,"We think of socialists in one way, Carl Sandburg was probably not it. But his letters to his soon-to-be wife, Lillian Steichen, are full of his fabulous prose and whimsy. They met briefly in January, this book takes us from then until their marriage in June. Sweet and full of love, their letters also tell the story of the socialist party in the early 1900's."
2,Not very sturdy,"The SwirlyGig isn't stiff, like I expected. It is a bit springy and flexible. It doesn't hang level on the mic stand. A pint glass that is more than 3/4 full will spill over the side when the glass is in the SwirlyGig. There is no way to tighten the attachment, so it slips down the mic stand to the joint where the two rods meet. It is fine for me height wise, but just doesn't seem very stable. If you wiggle or bump the mic stand the SwirlyGig will jostle its position around the pole (this aside from the obvious, that if you tip your mic stand you will tip your drink)."
5,Swirlygig Drink Holder Rocks!,"I bought this just as a gag, but it truly works wonders. Performing on stage, one of the biggest problems is losing track of your drink, and if you are a vocalist, it is of the utmost importance to be able to grab some hydration in between songs, or even in between words (sometimes). This is a little tricky to figure out the first time, but once you learn how to hook it up, it's a gem. It holds very fast to the mic stand and your cup is safely suspended at a level that's comfortable for you. The only downside is if you jump around alot or if you play guitar and sing, it might be a dangerous spill hazard (careful!) but overall, I found it to upgrade my live show by a few notches and people were asking me after where I bought it. If you're sick of kicking over cups of beer or searching for yours in a sea of half empties on the guitar cabs, kick up the fifteen bucks and get a swirlygig. (For us germ freaks, it's a necessity)."
4,Easily grab a drink,"I saw one of these when my friends band was playing. It holds a pint glass nicely. Some glasses will not fit. A bottle fits just fine. The drink holder will want to slide down from vibrations, but the stand adjustment knob stops it from going any further down the stand. I like the fact my drink is there and after a song or two you are not bending down to the floor to retrieve your drink."
1,Broke after 4 uses,The spout broke off after 4 uses. Very loud and jumps around. Not worth the money. Made with cheap plastic.
2,LIght Duty Machine,"Good performance for an entry level machine. Loud when operating, light duty construction. Conncetions are fragile and the slightest pressure may crack or break a plastic joint/connecting pin. Satisfied with operation but construction will send you looking for replacement parts or a different style machine. Received as gift."
1,Avoid this product,"We received the Smoothie Z SMZ500 for a christmas gift. At first it worked great (the first 3 times). Then the stir stick broke off at a seam. We glued that back together. Now the motor is DEAD after the FOURTH USE! I can't find a place that carries these to get it returned. It MIXED things really well, and I liked how the smoothies turned out - that part is great... but the durability of the design is aweful!"
4,Good machine,"I got mine yesterday and have used it twice already. The smoothies came out very good. The only complaints I have are1.) It is VERY loud. I live in an apartment and am afraid it will upset the neighbors! :) and2.) The spout clogs easily. I'll just have to add more juice/milk than the smoothie kit says to use. It has a lot of frozen fruit and it becomes too thick.The great thing about it though is it crushes ice VERY well! My blender won't do that.So overall, I really like the machine and recommend it. Just be courteous to your neighbors and use it before 10:00PM! :)"
1,Not very durable,Worked great for 2 weeks and then the gear on the bottom that spins the blade broke. It chewed up the entire piece that connects the glass to the spinner. Even when it did work there was a constant burning smell. This product is not well made.
2,Parts keep breaking,"After the second use, the spigot broke off. Not a big deal, we just poured from the top. Then the handle broke off about a month later. So we now hold it by the sides to pour. Then the stirrer separated top from bottom. Granted, it's now about 4 years old and we use it regularly, but it is becoming a bit ridiculous.The motor, however, is noisy, but has never given us a problem. It makes smoothies well from fresh and frozen ingredients. Cleaning is another issue altogether though. It needs to be taken apart into all components and it is still difficult to clean thoroughly. Served its purpose but will not buy again."
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"Just in case the negative reviews of others have not fully registered on potential buyers, I would like to second, third, and fourth the negative reviews. As other buyers have described, we used this Smoothie maker without incident about 10 times. Last night, we started the machine up, only to smell burning plastic. Upon inspection, what was left of the smoothie makers working parts was a small pile of black plastic chips. A word to the wise: working parts on a Smoothie maker should be metal, not plastic!"
2,smoothie user,"I bought the smoothie maker in August, 2003 and it worked great, although noisy...for awhile. The last and final time I used it smoke was coming out of the base where the motor is. I returned the machine to where I purchased it and got my money back - did not ask for a replacement."
3,Just a few improvements,"The smoothies are VERY good and it does crush ice well, but I am not so impressed with it's basic design. A handle would be SO usefull, as would a small spout for pouring directly from the blender (this is almost always necessary as the spout becomes clogged very easily). I can also see strange electric ""sparks"" beneath the buttons in the little space where the buttons are not entirely surrounded be the plastic. I have talked to some friends and I have been assured that this is nothing dangerous, but it still bothers me.Overall, I don't see how this too much better than a regular blender."
2,Nice Concept - Poor Execution,"I agree with the other reviewers; had the machine for a couple weeks, after 5 uses the machine didn't sit right on the base, causing the teeth between the base and the container to grind a bit. After that, it was all downhill. The base teeth were completely ground down within 2 uses. Interestingly, the new back to basics smoothie machines seem to have a better locking mechanism, and teeth that seem to be made of more durabe material."
5,Great Product,"I love this product, I have two of the machines myself. I have found the company very easy to work with and the customer service very friendly. They were able to handle any problem I had with the machine and had all parts avaliable to be sent to me immediately. I was able to find their website easily at www.backtobasicsproducts.com and it was great that they had a 800 #. I love the product and will be recommending it to all of my friends."
1,What a MESS!,"This machine is a cheap disaster! It worked great at first, but after probably 10 smoothies were made over a few week period, it started to leak from the base. Then it would shake and leak when in use. Finally, the top separated from the base while in use and the smoothie exploded all over the place! Do you know how long it takes to get strawberry goo off of the ceiling and every other surface in the kitchen?! I assumed it might have been my error or it just accidentally loosened over time, so I tried it once more a few days later while screwing the bottom on as tightly as I could, and holding down the blender while it was on. Same thing. Shaking, bottom separated from the unit, massive implosion. The entire thing went straight into the trash. There are MAJOR design flaws with this smoothie maker!!! Stick with a normal blender. Much cheaper and much more reliable. I'm off to buy one today."
2,"Awesome in theory, but doesn't follow through.","I was really happy to receive one of these as a birthday present because I love smoothies and slushies and anything like that. I thought the spout was a great idea too. Well, it did blend well and it made nice smoothies. However, it was very loud and emitted a horrible, rubbery smell. Then, for no apparent reason, the handle of the spout broke off. Maybe it was just my model, but after seeing the reviews I've seen here, I highly doubt it. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It seems to have a lot of quirks in design that need to be resolved. Stick to your regular blender."
1,Disappointed five times!!,"I first bought this machine in April and 3 months later my fifth one just broke!! After each breakdown, all major (the plastic teeth both on the machine and the bottom of the jar are much too weak for the intended use and one or the other would break after just a few times of use) I went to get a new one because when it works it is wonderful. I am now giving up and though my 14-yr old son has very much enjoyed the smoothies produced with this machine, I am certainly not getting another one and would definitely not recommend it to anyone. Besides the breakdowns, it could also be very messy through unexpected leakage. The concept is good but the realization is very poor."
3,Not for everyday use!,"This machine works fine, but I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use. The little rubber gaskets inside the spout mechanism wear out and the machine begins to leak from the spout. Can't just replace them from the hardware store either as they are a speacial size. I am in the process of trying to get some from the company which looks to be very difficult. The motor and ability to crush ice are just fine from my experience. Bottom line...use it once or twice a week and you should like it fine for the money spent."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF CRAP I EVER OWNED. THE BOTTOM COMES UNSCREWED WHEN YOU USE IT. WHEN YOU TRY TO TAKE IT OFF THE BASE, IT IS UNATTACHED AND THE CONTENTS SPILL ALL OVER THE FREAKING PLACE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY UNLESS YOU LIKE TO CLEAN YOUR COUNTER AND WASH YOUR FLOORS!!!"
1,Bad,"We owned this for 2 months until the motor went out, we had to send it in to get fixed. After we got it back, it worked fine, but it still is a cheap peice of trash. I just threw it away after owning it two years. Invest in a better product."
1,AWFUL MACHINE,"This machine is a total waste of money, don't buy it! We got it for a gift and used it about 7 times before the part on the bottom of the liquid container broke! We used as per instructions as well. Could not find this company anyplace to find parts so I could fix it, it was well past 90 days and it probably comes from some little village in the middle of China that has no phones anyway. (not trying to be prejudiced here, just making a point as to the available service, NONE)DO NOT BUY IT!"
1,Teeth at bottom of liquid chamber worn down,"I agree with Terry Cappetta's review. I've had mine for about 2 months and used it about 25+ times with no problems, and like his, the teeth at the bottom of the liquid chamber wore down. The unit with the motor still spins fine, but the teeth at the bottom of the liquid chamber will NOT attach to the base unit and therefore will not grind the ingredients. All I see are black shavings from the bottom of the liquid chamber. That's too bad, considering it worked fine until now. Unit still LOOKS new, but what good will a good-looking unit do me if it doesn't work properly? I really liked this product until now."
1,Not likely to last!,"We tried on and the thin stamped threaded adapter plate on the motor shaft stripped out on the second smoothie. As an engineer, I am not supprised. The threads are too short to hold up to the stress of chopping ice. A total waste of money!"
1,great idea if it wasn't all plastic,Too much plastic-the spout broke off after a few uses-it is just held on with two little plastic pegs. Then the gear in the bottom unit stripped out. It would be a great machine if it was made with more durable material. I would not waste my money.
1,Plastic Gears are Trouble,"This blender blended the smoothies very well. However, the vibrations of the machine caused the jar to shake itself off the gear assembly, causing the plastic gears on the top of the machine and at the bottom of the jar to wear down until it became unusable. It lasted about 2 months (60 smoothies) and ended in the trash since the repairs would be about the same, or more than a new one. It would be a great little machine if the plastic was replaced with metal parts. But alas, manufacturers want you to go out and buy another one. I have refused to buy any blender with plastic parts, and when someone makes one I will pay gladly their asking price."
