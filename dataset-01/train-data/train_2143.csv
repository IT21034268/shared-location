5,Tells it like it is!,"Excellent product. Dr Phil is a straight talking, easy to understand, no psycho babble genius! Simple to follow step by step guide to improving your life and ridding yourself of your ""baggage"" in a healthy way."
3,Well..,"I thought it was a good book with more-than-common-sense ideas, but well, I can't really say this book CHANGED my life in any way (as much as I wish it did.) For some of you, it might be different. This is a good book, but didn't make it up to my expectations."
1,Is this guy real?,"Dont buy this book, you could get more wisdom from fortune cookie fortunes!This was the most incredibly trite book I have ever read....half of the book is an ancedote focused on Oprah....he writes 5 page acedotes that dont make any sense or tie to any point...it was impossible to read without getting extremely frustrated...it was so bad that of our book club of 8 people only 1 read it all the way through and even though I was the facilitator of the book club meeting featuring this I couldnt even get through it...."
1,"Coach says ""Go! Go!""","The reader might as well go ahead and buy this book if they are like I suspect most people are-- that is, ready to respond, for a moment anyway, to a good football coach telling them how to improve their life. Never mind that the book is unforgivably shallow and weak, and that it is just a bit goofy. The self aggrandizement of the author who makes it sound like Oprah is riding his shirt tails rather than the other way around is pure rah rah coach hucksterism. At least Coach McGraw does give his followers exercises to do in addition to the pep talk. Were life so simple."
1,Talk about an emperor with no clothes,"A friend saw the author on Oprah and bought a copy of the book for me. I was 65 pages in to it and getting nothing in return. Rather than give up, I read another 50 pages and found nothing but list after list of trite cliches and hokey exercises sprinkled with tidbits about Oprah's trial. I'm glad she didn't have to pay those cattle rustlers and I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this book."
5,happy student,"this book has been a great review for my real property II class and i would recommend it, especially for students who are as confused by property law as i am!"
2,Annoying mistakes cause needless confusion,"Most people will purchase a book like this as an outline-style helper to supplement their casebook in law school (I'm assuming). Substance-wise, the book does the job pretty well and lays all the concepts out with helpful examples. However, its inexcusable when a book has errors that potentially result in sentences meaning entirely different things. For example, I've spotted at least two places where the author uses vendee in place of vendor. Using the wrong term of art causes unneccessary confusion in a book that is supposed to clarify the situation- especially in a subject like property law where there are so many loaded words. In short, these authors are all lawyers who I'm sure like to pontificate on the importance of careful editing- practice what you preach!"
2,Not the best T,"Very low in front, need to wear a tank top underneath or undergarment will show. Very transparent and had a hard time getting wrinkles out after it had been laundered"
4,I rode a bus once with Sam.,"Never knew who the guy was as he rode next to me on a Greyhound bus. I was a teenager in a Knoxville, TN military academy on my way home for a visit.I offered him a cigarette and he politely declined and we began to talk. Seems he had missed a flight in Knoxville, TN and took the bus for a 5 hour trip into Columbia, TN for a private flight which was waiting for him there. He told me who he was and that he was a kind of famous performer. When he asked had I ever heard of them, I dully replied ""nope...never"" lol I was only interested in smoking up some cigs and getting home. He said ""I bet if you ask your mom, she's heard of us. Well when I told her and my Aunt that owned the bus station in Columbia, they were really excited, but happened to somehow just miss him for an autograph opportunity. After all he was in a hurry. Just a lil' story...."
1,The Emporers new clothes?,"Please, somebody email me and tell me what it is about this kind of music that people enjoy listening to it. It seems so disonent, it has no melody, rhyme, or reason. It sounds like Ferris Bueller playing the clarinet when he says: ""Never had one lesson."""
5,Excellent service and product!,"Excellent product. Glad I purchased it! When taking off the wax, it does create small wax balls but I didn't really care, it got the wax off me! I would purchase product again!"
1,Wrong picture for the item,"The picture is 3M CG6000, also for inkjet printers but the item is actually 3M CG5000, which is only for copiers and laser printers.Wrong info."
4,We have been using this for a long time!!,This is really great for presentation package.We have been using this for a long time.
2,not recommended,Nastassja Kinski is totally hot but the movie is long and not worth it for dedicated viewing but if you multi task if has some interesting scenes.
3,"John Savage is superb, but Nastassja Kinski is better","Savage comes back from the war to find out his crush when he was little has a boyfriend but the 2 end up being married. Mitchum and Carradine seem miscast but that doesnt count the fact of the good story and good performances by the leading man and woman. god I want to just, take Kinski home and butter her up, lick her, prop her on the couch. shes a lover in my eyes. there are some scenes with her where I just shivered and my jaw dropped, shes a goddess"
3,"Chilling movie, lousy transfer","""Pitfall"" is the bleak, beautiful tragedy of a man who makes one mistake, and watches his life spiral out of control as a consequence. I'll forgo a plot synopsis (earlier reviewers have that covered) and merely note that the print-on-demand Synergy Entertainment DVD is a lousy transfer of a terrific movie. The image on this disc is faded and slightly blurred from beginning to end -- for viewers of a certain age, it's like catching this picture, with uncertain reception, on a local TV station's late, late show (back when there were things on late night TV besides infomercials). The sound, though, seems fine.In the absence of any other available DVD transfers of this movie, this disc will do. It'll have to."
3,Improved Over Synergy Release,"Ok, the Film Chest release isn't exactly pristine, but it is an improvement over the Synergy release. The source material just wasn't in that great a condition--which is probably why it took so long for this film to come to DVD. Anyway, it is quite watchable and is in fact a great movie. With Raymond Burr (who steals the movie in a very menacing fashion) along with Dick Powell and film noir diva Lizabeth Scott---how can you go wrong?"
2,Terrible betrayal of a wonderful film,"Pitfall is one of the underappreciated gems of the ""classic noir"" era. I was tremendously excited to see that it had finally been released on DVD. Alas, the excitement was premature. The quality of this transfer is simply execrable--the VHS tape looked better. Poor resolution and contrast rob this film of its power. And it's burned on a DVD-R, which means that the disc will start to go bad within a decade, possibly in a few years. I suppose this disc is better than nothing for those who can't see the film any other way, but this version does no justice to this terrific film. Synergy Entertainment should be ashamed."
5,A Great Film Noir Classic,"'Pitfall' is one of the great flim noir classics of the 1940's. The screenplay, direction, and performances are all pitch perfect."
2,Ug. Hardly gets going.,"A movie without any dressing-up and sadly missing music early on. Emotion does not build like it should.Lack of wonder, dressing, flirt, makes it stark in a dull way, not a noir way. So mildly direct-to-the-point without complex build and without supporting characters much involved that movie is almost too technical, yet the actors give it something personal saving it from a technical presentation-only death.A complete story but an incomplete treatment that does not build the surrounding world well. Actors are great so story gets the blame.Would work for a movie class training film to show this problem of lacking support world excitement thus letting the main story fall dead."
1,No delivery - Find another vendor,"We really wanted this old-time candy that we saw in the picture. We ordered it on Amazon and received shipment notification. After 10 days, we contacted the seller who was unresponsive. We then got another shipment notification saying it will be there in 3-5 days. Nothing arrived. Finally, we got a message saying they were out of stock and Amazon refunded our money. In all, it took about a month to resolve. I'm very disappointed."
3,Old Time Christmas Mix,Was great for one time memory but was too expensive. These candies however bought back memories of younger days. I love it!
1,Bad Program & Unresponsive Customer Service,"1) When a file folder is encrypted, one cannot open a single sub-folder or file without un-encrypting or de-crypting the entire folder contents which can takes well over an hour if, for example, you protect your ""My Documents"" Folder.2) Digital Vault fails to recognize all removable drives3) Customer Service NEVER RESPONDED to my request for help when I completed the customer service request on their web site.4) DO NOT BUY. I wasted my time & money. Do NOT waste yours."
1,use free deVault instead,"If you need digital vaults, use deVault instead. In addition to compression and encryption it also has built-in categorization, revision control, easy search and retrieval options, fully automated backup and vault synchronization, email, ftp, printing, scanner and virus scan interfaces. Free for personal use, download direct from ekwintools.com"
1,Dangerously bad software,"It won't reliably encrypt and decrypt for me. Attempts to decrypt have resulted in the error message ""An unexpected error occurred while Decrypting (filename). Would you like to retry?"" Pressing Yes just sends it into infinite loop: the files never get decrypted, and so they are lost. Even when it DOES tell me that it has decrypted successfully and no error messages are generated, the files still do not re-appear in the directory tree, so they remain inaccessible. This is probably the worst software I've ever purchased."
3,it is plastic not metal,"By the picture and expected use I thought this item would be made of metal not plastic. However, do to the low cost I feel it still warranted a like rating."
4,Pirate fun,This product arrived over 2 weeks later than promised due to bad weather in the area....well after Christmas....contacted vendor but no response...not very good customer service...vendor chose to use Fed Ex ground as shipper even though I paid extra for it to arrive before Christmas....my son says it was worth the wait. He loves to battle this ship with his other smaller ships.
5,"Well written, enjoyable reading, excellent research source.","Haley's book on Glenwood Canyon is extremely well-written, attractively illustrated, and exhaustively researched. He does an excellent job of detailing the design and engineering problems, the concerns of the environmentalists, the personalities of the myriad individuals and organizations that provided unput during the planning and construction processs Finally, he shows the reader the engineering marvel that is Interstate 70 through Glenwood Canyon."
5,Excellant,I very much enjoyed the technical information and the more humanaspects also included. I would have enjoyed more pictures but Iknow it is already a large volume. It is worth taking with youif you plan to travel the canyon. One can more fully appreciatethe beauty and struggle that went on in the building of thehighway.
2,You get what you pay for,"This pot was a bit of a disappointment. I guess that the adage ""You get what you pay for"" is true. I picked this one because it was the cheapest I found and now I know why. It is made with thinner aluminum and is less quality. The pot was distorted out of shape from pressure on the carton during shipping. This was actually easily fixed by just squeezing the pot back into shape. A good quality stockpot of this size would never be that flimsy or easy to bend out of or into shape. I can't wait to fill it up with water and pick it up by the handles. It feels like it is likely to distort just from the weight of the water and pressure of the handles on the flimsy sides. I would recommend paying a little more and getting a thicker, more commercial quality pot."
4,Great pot for the money,"The ONLY reason it is not getting 5 stars is that the pot walls were thin, however the insert was a great fit, the burner that is recommended for this pot heated the water very quickly. we cooked 300 pounds of crawfish in five hours."
4,Harry does bossa nova: Nice!,"Sometimes a whole album of bossa nova renditions can get tiresome, but not in this case. Harry does a fine job with these bossa tunes. His sound is warm and compelling. ""Corcovado"" and ""Once I Loved"" are particularly good. If you enjoy the sound from Brazil, you'll like this CD a lot."
3,"The style, not the story","While the style of Annie Proulx's prose gripped me immediately, the story never did. The prose is very carefully crafted and is worth taking time over. She writes very methodically using metaphor very skillfully and creatively.Unfortunately, this is not a story that will move you too deeply. Sure, the characters can be related to and in particular Quoyle is depicted so clearly you feel like you are very involved in his life. But I finished the book wanting more and wondering what, in fact, the story had really been about."
4,A Knot,"This book was more of a reality than most fiction books. It went through the real tradgedy of a man who was an outcast his whole life, easily fading into the shadows. He was married to a two-timing wife who met her untimely demise in a car accident, Quoyle, with the help of his Aunt, was left to raise his two daughters on his own in the harbor of Capsize Cove in Newfoundland. Annie Prolux used great imagery to describe the Newfoundland coast and even the many colorful characters emotions. I would definetly recommmened this book to someone else."
1,and the point is...?,"this book seemed such a waste of time on the part of an obviously able author. Yes, she conjured up wonderful landscape and characters. Yes she has a... let's say interesting... way with sentence structure which might be viewed as Literature by those who think chopping a senetence up means the author is Very Clever. But if you're going to invest that skill and time, do something with it for goodness sake. I was left at the end of the book thinking ...AND???? What was the point of wading through all that, just for that? This is only elevated above Mills and Boon status by the poncey critics who blather on about it in the media."
2,I Didn't Get It. Pulitzer Prize ???????,"Maybe I'm old fashioned, but sentence fragments annoy me. I'm especialy annoyed when the author uses them over and over. This book is lushly written, but has no central plot. I was left only with a feeling that Newfoundland isn't too nice of a place to live. I know that I'm out of the mainstream. I mean, Pulitzer Prize and all. ( God, now I'm using sentence fragments, too.)This book is for the reader who loves lush descriptions, and who doesn't care much about a story never going anywhere."
1,This is the worst book I ever tried to read!,"I just don't get it. Maybe it is a sign of my literary ignorance. I tried to read it and listen to it, but it was too painful to endure. For me, the book had no redeeming qualities - not the characters, the plot (or lack thereof), or the writing style. A complete waste of time."
1,I must confess...,"...I never finished this book. I started it three times. Each time I would struggle a little farther than before, in search of anything more meaningful than banal characters with silly names, trying to find out the secret: why on EARTH would anyone praise this drivel? It's novels like this that have led me to believe that the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award are more about self-congratulation on the part of the prize committees (""Our critical judgement is soooooo superior to that of the average reader"") than literary merit on the part of the works considered."
1,UGH - 4 years and I STILL can't finish this book,"I picked up this book because I heard she was a great author and this book had won the Pulitzer. That was over 4 years ago and I still haven't made it half way through. Although her writing is very descriptive and lush it just DRAGS and feels like such an effort to read. When the movie came out I thought ""Good, now I can at least I can see what the story was all about"", but guess what? My husband and I walked out about 1/3 of the way through - we just couldn't stand it. Guess it wasn't meant to be and I'll never know what happens to Quoyle. P.S. Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune recently wrote a column about how much time one should invest in trying to read a book before calling it quits. Interestingly ""The Shipping News"" was one that he also couldn't get through! At least I'm not the only one."
2,High Hopes Squashed,"I have a 100 page rule. If a book does not engage me in 100 pages, out it goes. I broke my rule for this book and kept on and on. I kept thinking it had to get better soon, after all it won all those awards. I just kept struggling through the entire book. And then the ending - the ultimate disappointment. I checked out this site after the fact, just to see if I was crazy. I'm glad to see I'm not alone. It looks like many of you were disappointed too!"
4,an inspiration,"I was very happy with the way the book worked out -- I found Quoyle's denseness at the beginning very difficult in a protagonist, but I stuck with him through the hard beginning and was rewarded with the vision of his slow and steady maturation. I even have my doubts about whether such profound changes are realistic, but finally, I think, one realizes that this character is EAP's gift to her readership, for us to mock at first, perhaps, and then cheer on, but eventually to empathize with, since we could all use a little more gumption in our lives, a little more courage, and a little less drifting with life's tides. Of course, the language and descriptions are luminescent, and one could profitably read the book for those alone."
1,If only I had the option of giving it less than one star...,"I am an avid and open-minded reader. I enjoyed reading just about every type of book that exists and, until ""The Shipping News"" came along, I was proud to say that I had never put a book down half way through. Those days are over though! I struggled through this book, thinking ""It won a Pulitzer Prize, it has to be good!"" and ""John Travolta is going to be in the movie, it has to be good!"" but I finally realized that only a rewrite was going to make this a good book. I found Quoyle to be annoying and stupid. But, even more than that, I found the poor use of the English language to be so distracting that half way through the book I gave up. After reading the reviews, I was astonished to find that people actually enjoyed this book! I've read many ""difficult"" books but this was beyond ""difficult""; it was impossible!"
1,I just didn't enjoy it,"Her writing style was hard to follow. The characters are boring, depressing, and didn't compel me enough to want to try harder to understand. It wasn't my cup of tea. I see that some loved it, but I prefer writing that is so smooth and beautifully written that you forget you are reading and become enveloped in the story. When I read this I had to say ""What the h*ll is she talking about?"" too many times. Call me unrefined. This is probably the kind of book 10th grade English teachers are assigning to their unwitting students. Poor kids.To be honest I just gave up and didn't finish it. Thank GOD I had that option, life is too short."
1,This book won awards?!?!?,"I will make this review short- I don't want to waste anymore time even thinking about this book. These characters were completely underdeveloped. Quoyle was supposed to go through a psychological transformation. He was supposed to ""...confront his private demons..."". Unfortunately, this was lacking. But what's worse is the absent plot. Proulx's descriptions of Newfoundland were vivid. But let's face it, how many times can you read about the blue water and cold weather? Honestly, I wish I never read this book."
1,I have more fun playing bridge with my Grandmother!!!,"Annie fails to captivate the reader as she tries to expound upon the meaning of bucolic life in Nova Scotia in the late 20th century. Her writing was less than charismatic and seemed punctuated by over zealous hand picked dictionary idioms. These terms seemed out of style and context in an otherwise bland plot line. In summation this book, does little to enhance creative North American literature, but merely serves as a verhicle to pass a few hours, if that, on a foggy Norwester day"
1,Plainsong - with cold water,"Here I go again, out on a limb - or is that plank? As I said of Kent Haruf's ""Plainsong,"" this book is too ""artsy"" for me. I borrowed the unabridged audio version from my local library system (Thank Goodness!) for a recent long car trip.What we have here is a failure to communicate or to adequately introduce characters - they just suddenly appear and disappear in a fog of what the author must consider ""beautiful new prose."" After re-winding several times to answer the question, ""Now who is THIS?"" I hit the Eject button midway through Tape 1/Side 1 and drove on through the beautiful North Dakota Plains in silence."
2,Same story... different setting,"A lot of books are about man's struggle, etc. Frankly, it gets a bit boring and ""ho-hum"" after awhile. The only difference with this novel is the location: Newfoundland.As a Canadian, I have been to Newfoundland and I think the author's depiction is really off base. I believe it gives readers a false impression of what this maritime province is really like.Some characters are annoying and I'm not a huge fan of her narrative voice. I also dislike the excessive use of sentence fragments. This is, of course, personal preference. My opinion of the book is that the use of descriptive detail and imagery and other literary devices conceals the fact that the plot is fairly bland."
2,I don't get it,"I got within 100 pages of finishing The Shipping News when it occurred to me that I no longer cared about a single one of the characters. I really, really tried to like this book, but it just wasn't happening, then I got tired of trying. Reading a book should be a lot more fun than this was. Yawn!"
3,An Insight into Newfoundland,The Shipping News wonderfully illustrates the landscape and life of Newfoundland. The bleekness and bitter cold of Newfoundland serves as a backdrop to this dark comedy. Proulx brings out the culture of the area by carefully crafting the dialect within the conversations.The 3-star rating is due to the difficulty I had involving myself in the book. I did not find the book openly invites the reader.
5,"A new brand of ""Americana""","Occasionally I find a book which is ""complete"" -- character, theme, writing style, imagery, mood, different strands of story -- all become interwoven (or remain appropriately separated!) to a satisfying end. The story moves along at a clip and, having been told that Proulx is a good short story writer I fancied her short story style was nicely evident throughout. The mood and scenes in the book match my experience of the physical settings. The story line is good."
1,"girl nearly shoots herself, throws book in corner first","after finishing and thoroughly enjoying ""the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay,"" i thought these pulitzer prize people might know what they were talking about. i bought ""the shipping news."" i read the first chapter and threw it across the room. proulx's writing style is infuriating. ridiculous descriptive sentences that are trying very hard to sound ""deep"" or ""profound"" are just, well, rediculous. i suppose some people will see that it won a pulitzer prize and, if they don't like it, will just assume that the pulitzer committee are smarter than them, but they'd be wrong. this book just stinks."
1,"No stars, please ...","The choppy writing style (I honestly don't believe that there is one complete sentence in the entire novel) wore me down. It unnerved me, made me edgy. I know there are probably some people out there going, ""That's right! That's it!! It unnerved you like a good novel should!!!"" Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Even edgy, unnerving books should allow you room to slip into the prose and become one with it. I tried in vein to slip into this book. It had nothing to do with the subject matter, just the style of writing. If this is what makes a Pulitzer prize-winning novel, you can count me out."
1,!!!Can't get any worse than this!!!,"The Shipping news is about an average guy named Quoyle who tries to start a new life in Newfoundland. His two-timing wife died in a car crash and his parents have committed suicide so his aunt comes down to stay with Quoyle and his two lovely young girls. Soon after the aunt, Quoyle and the girls set off to Newfoundland to start a new life. Quoyle gets a job at the local news paper and the aunt sets up an upholstery shop. They both uncover various things about there past and their ancestors. This whole plot line is just way to confusing and not interesting enough. This book is lacking in irony. There are no surprises or any hooks to pull you in. You also don't feel any connection to the characters and it is pointless to read. This book is filled with detail, but it uses such strong vocabulary you forget what is being described in the first place. This book seems to go on forever; the pages just drag on and on. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
1,The Shipping News,"Got the unabridged audio tape from the library. Tried to listen. Couldn't hack it. Gave it up after 1 1/2 cassettes. Dreadful dull. Traffic was more interesting. All inane prose, no action. Don't get it. A Pulitzer Prize? Why is relentless neglect of pronouns considered a literary style? Find it annoying. Reads like a George Bush speech."
5,"Boy, I could see the people and smell the air!",Just tremendous - absolutely loved it! This book is one I will actually read again. Have loaned it to friends who also thought it wonderful. What good fortune to have picked it up :-)Thankyouthankyouthankyou!
5,A true gem,Please bear with the first 30 odd pages; they are an anomoly to an otherwise beautifuly crafted book. This is a story that not only pulls on your heartstrings but also allows you to believe that there is hope for Everyman/woman. I love this story
5,"A ""zinger"" on every page.","As all books must end, ""Shipping News"" was rationed for the last 80 pages. I simply did not want to say goodbye to my friends. Hopeful characters that gained color and fullness without revealing all, left me with enough room to muse their pasts and hope for their futures. It's not every day that one grieves the end of a book. Whether or not this was a true picture of New Foundland (NOOF'und-lund?) or not, it's endeared the Maritime way of life for me. I'll continue to rave and recommend it, as I have for the last 2 years!"
5,Unforgettable!,"The books I have forgotten in the past twenty years could fill a trailer truck (they haven't though, Ive thrown them out). I Will NEVER forget this treasure of a book. I'm not surprised by the few very negative reviews, only by the reasons given for why the book was distasteful: 1)One reviewer found it ""Hard to understand the popularity of a book where the characters are off-the-chart maladapted and cast into bizarre situations"" MacBeth? Ahab? Most any character by James Joyce? 2) A teacher laments that Prolx's overuse of sentence fragments is subverting her attempts to teach proper writing style. Too bad. Haven't read Ulysses? Improper writing style. Seriously, this is one of the great ones."
2,Derivative and overpraised,"Proulx novel is in the tradition of those contemporary American novelists who cannot disgengage their voices from the previous generation of more distinguished storytellers. It displays a somewhat lively imagination, but one in which scenes and characters are drawn through the lens of so many novels before it. The characterizations are affected and mannered, and the narrative itself never manages to break out of its studied grooves. Although the novel attempts moments of poetic intensity, and occasionally manages to acheive a vision of the natural world, such moments stand to the side of the bulk of the novel."
2,When Bad Things Happen To Stupid People,"I read this book while visiting some relatives in Nova Scotia a few years back. Having read it already, my aunt gave it to me with the lukewarm encouragement, ""It's won several awards, they say.""None of the characters engaged me in any way. Nothing compelling seemed to happen, perhaps the only exception being when Wavey revealed her late husband's true self. But by then it was too late in the book for me to really care. As a whole, it seemed to be the same sort of misadventures of the maladroit as _Beavis and Butthead_, a work that can only be enjoyed by standing steadfastly outside the narrative frame and smirking at the mishaps within.After vacation, I got rid of the book by handing it off to one of my co-workers. His reaction to it was, ""Great books don't come out every year. Sometimes not even good ones come out. But every year, they still have to pass out the awards."""
2,"Weird book, hard to get through","The Shipping News by Annie Proulx is a rather odd book. Little action, nice descriptions of Nova Scotia, and far fetched characters are in this book.The book tells the story of Quoyle. Quoyle is a newspaper reporter for a 3rd rate paper in New York. He is ugly, fat, and has very low self esteem. After his wife leaves him for another man and sells his two daughters (as I said, odd book), his wife dies in a car accident. Quoyle takes back his kids and moved back to his ancestrial homeland of Killick-Claw Nova Scotia. There he lives day-to-day.I read this book with several other people. All of them found this book very boring and hard to get through. Nobody felt any remorse for the protaganists problems, or even cared.I would not suggest this book. It is kinda like a roller coaster,once you think that you are going for the sky (an interesting plot development), you find yourself plunging toward the ground. For the story gets worse."
3,Humorous,"Throughout, the novel is tastefully peppered with rich language and witty humor. For example, Quoyle often imagines his life in newspaper headlines that loathingly announce his shortcomings. After buying his first boat, he is told it is ""a wallowing cockeyed bastard no good for nothing"" and ""not only is it no good for nothing, but it makes you cry to look at it,"" to which Quoyle pictures the headline, ""Stupid Man Does Wrong Thing Once More"" (89)."
1,A Colossal Bore,"All of the Pulitzer Prizes in the world (yes, this book won in 1994) can't save ""The Shipping News"" from terminal boredom. Proulx belongs to a segment of the modern school which deemphasizes plot, which might work if the characters and their inner thoughts were fascinating. But this essentially plotless novel is populated by some very dull individuals. It's one thing to write well, which Proulx does, but it's another thing to have something to write about. If your want to read a book which celebrates ordinariness, this slight tale might be for you, but don't be surprised if you, too, end up as bored as I was."
2,pulitzer schmlutizer,"Like others, I don't get how this book won any type of award. That was the reason I kept reading this family yarn set in Newfoundland. I actually thought the first half of the book was interesting and liked the imagery used by the author. Quoyle, a young widowed father of two young girls and the rest of the cast were quirky and I felt the story was setting up a more interesting second half. Boy was I wrong! To use the author's style of short sentences. Boring. Goes downhill. Not. Maybe some may like her abstract way of communicating a story...read at your own risk."
2,The Shipping News,"One of the more average Pulitzer prize winners I have encountered. What I feel the book lacked was depth of character, the characters are touched upon but not fully explored, even Quoyle I do not now feel that I know much about. The story wends and falls a few times, just as you think the author could be creating something dramatic it stops and turns another direction, much like the Northerly polar winds.The main theme of the book, Quoyle's plight, I enjoyed. From hopelessly desperate and unrequited love and then to eventually find happiness again is well handled, the final paragraph excellent, but this theme too could have had more depth.The book is different with a refreshing style of writing, for which I will long remember it, but lacks what I would expect from the company it keeps in the annals Pulitzer winners."
1,Forget it!,"I don't think I even read to page 100, just could not get into this book. I read constantly and keep track of the books I read by author, by year to make sure I don't pick up one that sounds good that I have read before.I think the main reason I checked this out from the library was because it had been made into a movie. All I could think about when I started it was the description of the main character sure didn't fit Kevin Spacey!So giving this one star even is not a qualified rating. Sorry but no thanks."
2,Kinda Boring and Pretentious,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I never saw the movie, and so I can't compare it. I'm a book reader not a movie watcher.There were occasional good moments (the articles from the newspaper, the recollection of the party, some of the characters were great) but not enough to make this novel very good.And the ""NPR-Like"" descriptions using incomplete sentences as descriptive devices. I found that very very annoying after a while.Anyway, obviously, many people disagree with me here. This book won the Pulitzer. I try to read all Pulitzers..just to know what is out there. This was definitely not near the top of the heap of Pulitzer history."
2,Yet another collection of many ink blots on dead flat trees,"This is an okay book. I am quite unaffected by it. I am not impressed with Quoyle's development as a blah blah blah and his harrowing trials and tribulations with blah blah blah. Nor does the. Paragraph structure. Really have a negative effect. On. Me. All in all, this was yet another of the multitude of books assigned for me to read by my English teacher. One final note: Why give it a 2 and not a 3? This book reads slower than an upside-down, mirror-imaged, badly-spelled Swahili manual on sub-atomic particle dynamics."
4,An inside look at this wonderfully harsh province.,I really enjoyed the The Shipping News although I found much of the sentence structure to be slightly difficult to read. The wonderful descriptions and characters made up for that. It was like a return to the past for me--having lived in Newfoundland for 2 years in the 1960's. I can hardly wait for the movie version!
4,A charming book thats rather funny.,"This book is very detailed and funny. The characters are well worked and realistic. Sadly I found myself wondering how bland and dull the life is in Newfoundland. It does not deserve 5 stars as I have read better books. But I would recommend it to anyone looking to break away from more convensional subjects, as the plot seems so sublime it is original."
3,"But in the end, do I really care?","The story was quite charming at times, and I was seduced more than once by certain events in the novel to plow through, but in the end I found the story unconvincing and the characters not well developed. The novel's version of Newfoundland just sucked the life out of them, I guess."
4,It's becomes worthwild reading it when you reach the end!,"A difficult book to read. Reading as a Year 12 VCE (Victoria, Australia) student I found I wasn't imersed in it as I was reading it out of work and not out of pleasure. An excellent book to read if you have visited Newfoundland or are considering going their. The book is full of mystery and excitement, love and tradegy. Read the first 100 pages before you turn it down. The first 40 are back ground which build a base for the book later. A good novel overall."
2,Get the OFF!,"Proulx is a solid writer and fresh voice in fiction. However, getting into this novel's plot was like wading through a mosquito infested muddy swamp; exhausting and painful."
5,KUDOS FOR THIS PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR!!,"Being a connoisseur of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, I felt The Shipping News true poetry! The hero, Quoyle, is reminescient of Ignatius, John Kennedy Toole's also bumbling, elephantine character in A Confederacy of Dunces. And Ms. Proulx's writing style has that unique quality inherent in award winning authors. The Quoyle/Proulx and Ignatius/Toole combos are indeed treasures for book collectors and aficionados of award winning sagas"
3,Better at the end,"I bought this book to read on the airplane, and it was a good diversion for a long flight. It took quite a while to get into the book and for me to care what happened to these characters, but I did and in the end I enjoyed seeing Quoyle triumph, even if only in a limited way.The writing style gets a little tiresome, because it is a little too staccato, but the style fit the characters and the place and provided kind of a sensation of the place, which is harsh and difficult.Overall, I liked it."
4,Well worth reading,"This work is not flabbergastingly brilliant, true enough, but it is a very good read. I found the story interesting and I related to the main character. There were points where I found myself thinking ""I understand how he feels here."" At other times I thought ""Wow, I never looked at it that way before"" and I felt much better about how I felt about my self as well as things that have happened around me. I would certainly put this on my list of books that are worth reading. I really enjoyed it."
1,The Most Overrated Book I Have Ever Read,"I think it is a shame that such a self-conscious, pretentious and contrived book has ever gotten the attention this one has. The dialogue rings so false that it's just laughable, each character speaking with virtually the same clever ""quirkiness"" which soon becomes completely draining. I am dumbfounded that readers do not see through the phoniness of this writing. I hope Ms. Proulx's other books are not this abysmal or eventually the world will wake up and see through this sham. There are so many better things to do with one's time. . ."
2,Boring and Contrived.,I tried very hard to get through this book but I cannot. I think there are three chapters left but I just cannot bring myself to read them even though I always try to finish a book once I have begun. I just went to pick it up again and realized how little pleasure it brings me. The characters are boring and do little. The prose is choppy and awkward. I keep expecting something to happen but nothing does. I am not surprised that I never heard of the movie before looking up this review. Save yourself hours of torture. Do not buy this book.
1,Disappointed,"A slow, dull story with settings and characters that I found impossible to in the slightest way. Hardly the page-turner that some say it is. The written language often lacks fluidity, and often sounds as if the author tried too hard to add color and texture to the prose. The main character is very flawed -- so much that I found it hard to sympathize with him during his hard times."
1,Judge this book on its own merits - not critical acclaim!,"Despite my high expectations (due to critical praise & trusted recommendations), I found this book to be completely miserable. The protagonist is perhaps the least compelling creature in the history of literature. Read 10 pages before you purchase this book - it does not get any better!"
1,More in sorrow than in anger...,"Yawn, yawn, yawn! We tried to like it but the relentless quirkiness, the puddle-deep characterization, and the too-good-to-be-true protagonist finally defeated us. It's like Forrest Gump for snobs."
4,Different Perspective,"Not a traditional perspective on life for a Texan, which is why I recommend it. It is inventive and truthful, looking at life in Newfoundland. Proulx does not try to solve the mysteries of life; nor does she paint the picture of life ""happily ever after"". Rather, she honestly shows how those mysteries of life accumulate to become life itself."
2,Hope the Movie's Better,"Being a writer and hoping to break into the field, I was curious about a book that has been chosen for a movie. Maybe I missed something. It took awhile to get into this book and found it to be a little sluggish and plodding. I personally like characters with humor and strength as well as strong dialogue and action. I hope the movie's better."
4,Truly well written book!,"Although the piece can be hard to understand sometimes because of the constant references to boating and Newfoundland it is a very well writen book. The characters are compelling and the anologies are great! I love the way Proulx uses the knots to help us understand the many stages of love and life in general. Quoule is a great,unique and complex character that will inspire you and teach you new things. Overall it was a fine read and I can't wait to see the movie with the great Kevin Spacey as Quoule."
3,"I felt castaway to Newfoundland with quirky, boring people...","Although not meaning to be too critical, it is somewhat hard to believe this book garnered a Pulitzer. Okay yes, the book is exceptionally well written. The narrative is rich, and the characterizations are complete. Oh, and the author really seems to have captured every nuance of Newfoundland and its people. But honestly, the story itself is quite dull (it's about a dysfunctional family returning from New York to family roots in Newfoundland). The author probably wants the reader to see how the family adapted and in essence were enriched by the experience. But to me it was an endless churn of tedium with just a few breaks of interesting, sometimes very interesting moments.Bottom line: proof that an extremely talented writer's skill is sometimes not enough to make a book an enjoyable read. Not recommended."
4,"As usual, better than the movie","A strange book, a little inaccessible to non-Canadians. I think seeing the movie first helped a little by setting the scene and providing images. The motivation behind some of the actions of the characters is not always clear, such as, after their friend spent a long time refurbishing his boat, why did they sink it? Still, an interesting read that makes you think about how our actions toward others can reverberate down through their entire lives."
3,"Slow start, nice finish.",My book club picked this book to read. I had a hard time starting this book. It took me about 1/2 of the book before I started enjoying it. It had a good finishing though and I ended up being able to say that I enjoyed the book.
2,A dramatic but dark comical of a man's recovered life.,"After finding so much pain in love, Quoyle decides to get away and rediscover his life with his two kids. He meets many new people that change his life, but some things he just can't get past. This book showed promises and hardships, but it didn't interest me much. Annie Proulx used a great plot yet she put so much detail into matters that it ruined the whole point. This book has many twists and turns that make it hard to follow all the characters. Also, the author put a lot of useless information that made the storyline drag. Although I didn't enjoy the book, it is all in the perspective of the reader."
3,Finished it,"Though I was close to giving up -- no big payoff at the end, though maybe that's my Hollywood-bred expectations talking. There's no doubt that Proulx can write descriptions that are lyrical, vivid, stirring, etc. The question is, can she tell a story? The story and characters here are much better than in Postcards...but that was a pretty low bar. Quoyle eventually does develop a personality, to my pleasant surprise, and everyone undergoes some type of change, though it takes hundreds of pages to do so. A slow start, long, fairly interesting middle and rather slow end. And her writing style. All those fragments. No verbs. A bit irritating after page 70. Not a grammar Nazi, but still. I ended up being glad I stayed with this book long enough to get to the good stuff. Oh, by the way, when I got to the line about kisses flavored with seal-flipper pie, I had to pause for a moment because I really thought I might throw up."
4,Shipping News,I saw the movie on TV. Told my wife there has to be more to this movie than they showed. So I bought the movie on DVD. But I decided I wanted to read the book before I watched the DVD. I found it to be an easy read. Not really alot to ponder or spend alot of time trying to figure out what might be underlying in the plot
2,You're kidding! THIS won a Pulitzer Prize?,"I am probably being too generous in giving this book 2 stars, but I'm the one who forced myself to finish it, so I'll go ahead.I found this story extremely tedious and a real chore to wade through. I also thought if I read one more reference to the sea or sky looking like milk, I'd be sick. Ms. Proulx's weak attempts at creativity through the use of fragmented sentences, and her vulgar use of language, only made matters worse. Her characters are underdeveloped, to say the least. I was three quarters of the way through the book before I finally realized that fat, pathetic Quoyle was supposed to be going through some sort of ""humanizing"" transformation.I was disappointed with this story and relieved at the same time. Disappointed that a Pulitzer prize winning novel could be so lousy, and relieved when I finally came to the last page."
1,Could not wait for it to end,"This is the story of a man, damaged by childhood traumas, which caused him later to suffer a really bad marriage, and how he moves back to his ancestral home in Newfoundland to start a new life with his capable and anchoring aunt. Frankly, I could not wait for this book to be over. What started out as interesting, due to Ms. Proulx's quirky writing style, quickly devolved into a dull, boring and highly grotesque type of endless soap opera, where the character development was shallow, the action slow and ponderous. In a gray atmosphere of bad smells, bad weather, dirty places and weird food, these strange characters wove in and out inside a community portrayed as really dysfunctional. I was so wanting it all to stop. It could have been a much better book with characters that were more than one dimensional. The last few pages are a bit redemptive, but I'm not sure the entire slog through it is worth it."
1,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!,"I picked up the shipping news to read for my 10th grade english outside reading assignment. Once i begin reading the story, I realized this choice was a terrible mistake! Try as a might, i could not get into the book, nore any of the BORINg, POINTLESS characters...this book is the pitts don't attempt to read it, it is a total waste of time!!!!!"
5,superb,"What a wonderful book ! It's the first time in my life I finished reading the last word and turned back to page 1 to begin reading it all over again. This woman is a marvelous writer, with a unique style and a warm understanding of the human heart."
3,what is the big deal,"The only types of books that I read are the ones that win awards. So when I so the accolades given to this book I expected a lot from it. But when I finished the book I didn't now what the big deal was. Can someone please tell me. I thought that this book should've even come close to winning the Pulitzer. Past winners like Beloved, Lonesome Dove, and The Color Purple which by the way are some my favorite novel are 100 times better than Shipping News."
5,"bitter, sweet, and salty","E. Annie Proulx fully captures the tortured emotions of her main character, Quoyle, as he moves back to his family's native Newfoundland. It is a richly wrought, beautifully captured story of love lost, of making a home in an inhospitable place, of finding solace. Proulx's eye for detail works so well with her economy of words, and her prose reflects the environment in which the story is set. A remarkable book."
3,Metaphors Galore!,E. Annie Proulx uses an irritating amount of methaphors and similies in the first few chapters.The story is engaging and somewhat overcomes the writing.
4,"Subtlety, thy name is Quoyle","before i knew it, i was wrapped up in these characters' lives. what a nice book! a TRULY nice book. now, i can't argue that john Irving (my favorite) spins a nice yarn as well, but what was there not to like about Quoyle, the aunt and the supporting characters like Billy Pretty and his tale? simply one of the great books that lets you ride along its waves....if you need 334 pages of DIE HARD, don't read the shipping news"
2,"No thriller, that's for sure...","The Shipping News is well-written, and not unpleasant to read, but the problem is that the story is just so dreadfully boring. Of course, writing about very simple people living dull lives in a cold and underpopulated place doesn't help. How did this book win these two prestigious awards? You tell me. Yet more can be said, for this novel presents us with the underdog's version of the American Dream: ""If you work hard, don't complain, hang on to your loved ones, and are prepared to go where opportunities take you, there's a place for you too."" What do we see shining through? The values of the pioneers, of course, ie work ethic, perseverance, mobility, and family values. Is that enough to redeem the book from a one-star rating? Maybe, but not from a two-star one."
4,This is a Good Book!,"This is really a good book! The characters are rich and engaging. The prose is wonderful. The story really drew me in and kept me reading avidly until the end. This is NOT the kind of book I usually read, but I really liked it! It is a rare book that can create such a vivid atmosphere - you almost feel like you've lived there yourself. I recommend it."
4,Original and Moving,"If you can deal with the unusual style and simple subject matter, this book may prove to be one of the most moving you have read."
3,Newfoundlander with mixed feelings.,"This is a good work of fiction but it saddens me once again to see my homeland portrayed in this way. Newfoundlanders are warm, intelligent, witty and lovely people. I hate to see them appear, to outsiders, as stupid, uneducated, inbred idiots. It appears that this story took place part way up the west side of the island as they mention Deer Lake. I'm sure those people are truly insulted. I have lived in California since 1959 but grew up in NFLD and have family there. We are from St. John's area-all educated and successful. Not an inbred idiot in the lot."
4,Life's difficult and quirky,"This was a difficult novel to read. I agonized over the main character, trying to will him forcefully out of his stupor. The dry, undercurrent of humorous headlines was delightful. The picture of the people and culture of the land and the stark, bare emotional quality of the people just hurts! Ah, it was a great time. The way the weather, the house, the characters, the triumph of the people against the harshest of odds and the way that the difficult experiences were brought out made the characters so real. I hope to have the time to read this one again. Brillant."
5,Dizzyingly beautiful,"To those who claim Annie Proulx doesn't know how to write a ""proper sentence"", I ask this question: has anyone read any really good poetry lately? For this novel is a sensitively-written prose-poem, which gets into the deeper layers of both the characters and the atmosphere/setting as only a top-notch poem can. It's anything but dull and plodding; this is sheer artistry, a dazzling performance by one of our finest writers. The movie was okay, but it was like a nice box of raisins compared to lush, dew-misted grapes eaten straight off the vine. I love you, Annie Proulx!"
1,Difficult to read,This book would have been easier to read if Ms. Proulx did not use so many sentence fragments. I know that she deliberately used them to give the reader a sense of the characters' thoughts. But there are simply too many of them that they actually detract from the story.
2,Disappointing,"I simply bought the book a few years back because of the Pulitzer prize. The book starts off with interesting, non-ordinary points. However, it gets boring, what with the uncommon, if existing, words. After some chapters, it was abandoned because it was no longer appealing to me. I only continue reading it because of the upcoming movie. Of course I would hate it if I see the movie without finishing the book.Maybe the expectation is raised because of the award, so it suffers the disappointment. Her sentences are unique, OK, but it's not fair for people who do not expect such complex prose-writing in the first place."
2,Very Rare I can't finish a book!,"It is very rare that I can't finish a book, but I just couldn't do it! I found I had to reread many paragraphs, maybe it was because I am from the midwest, but the language seemed very strange. Living in Chicago area I thought I had heard every dialect in the world, but this one confused me. I gave this a fair chance and read more then half of it, but I had to give up. I don't care what awards it won, I was bored to tears."
2,Disappointed,"The Shipping News is one of my first Book Club reads. It's a Pulitzer Prize winner...so I knew it had potential to be a good one! It took me a while to get used to the language and rhythm of her writing. Once I settled into the dialect, I was better able to connect with the characters in the story. I did find parts of it to be so interesting, I was completely immersed and wished I could have heard more, while other parts were a little dull and I found myself tempted to skip over passages. I found it different than anything I had ever read before. Unfortunately, the reviews from the rest of the Book Club were mixed, and the story left little in way of discussion.[...]"
5,we loved it,My book club read this one and we all loved it. Annie Proulx gave us the most grist for discussion of any author we have read. The characters are unique and well developed. The story of a loser coming into his own is universal. The theme of resurrection comes up over and over. Some of my favorite things about the book are the descriptions of the sea and weather and the vivid images of the people living in this little arctic town.This story is also an interesting view of the Newfoundland people and thier seagoing culture. It is no mystery why this book earned a Pullitzer Prize.
5,Didn't want it to end.,"This book wrapped around me like a blanket, I loved it and wished it wouldn't end."
5,Great Novel,"Annie Proulx gives the masses a great treat with ""The Shipping News"". The novel shows the live of Quoyle, a man who has had it rough his whole life. His parents hated him, people in gereral seemed to hate him, and just recently his wife just left him with two kids, while he doesn't really have a stable job. After his wife died, he gained a substantial sum of money from life insurance. So his aunt comes down to vist him and convinces him to return to his ancestrial home in Newfoundland. While their Proulx gives us a cast of strange, yet funny people. While in Newfoundland Quoyle finds love, people that like him, a stable job as a writer for the local newspaper, and discovers a part of himself he didn't know was there. This book truely is a great, and if you havn't read this book yet, GO OUT AND BUY IT, because it is definately worth it."
1,"NEW YORKER FINDS NEWFOUNDLAND NOVEL ""AN ORDEAL""","I'm afraid I must agree with others who panned the book. The main character, Quoyle, seemed like a lumbering idiot, who happened to luck into a bit of happiness. I'm sure that Quoyle was a manifestation in abundant flesh of a certain internal ugleness that the author feels. But Quoyle never became real for me, and I saw this book as an exericse more than a novel: Can the author find symbolic characters and landscapes and objects (the knots! enough already!) to express her torment. On the other hand, the author's use of language was remarkeable, and her apparent knowledge of Newfoundland life was sweeping. And I did like her occasional expression of life in terse headlines. Like the one above."
1,Not as Advertised,I felt this book was poorly written. The writing was difficult to follow as there were many 'non-sentences'. Too many random phrases and thoughts. I hope the movie is better.
1,No more Prouxl for me,"The plot and characters are contrived and unbelievable. Prouxl's relentless dwelling on Quoyle being such a schlmiel becomes quite tiresome by two thirds of the way through. How can Mrs. Melville dismember her husband on the barge, when we have been told that it requires four other strong men as crew members? (maybe Prouxl reveals this secret later ...) Prouxl makes Newfoundlanders look like ridiculous bumpkins (with a peculiar interest in sexual abuse), whose only saving grace is some practical wisdom about the sea. Prouxl should try reading Graham Greene or Paul Theroux to learn how to place a novel in an exotic locale without turning the exercise into a cartoon."
1,"Um, yeah, that emperor has no clothes on","It's obvious that the Pulitzer Prize was done a great disservice here. This is a dull book with dull characters and an overbearing narrator who won't go away to allow me to get interested in the story. Though I don't know why I'm complaining--there is no story. A lot has been said about this being a book geared toward the more ""literary"" crowd; well, I've got an MA in English and I find this plotless little thing intolerable. Don't let anyone tell you that if you don't like this book you're stupid."
4,a darkly comic methaphor for a hard lived life,"This darkly written novel slowly absorbed me,its richly woven story steers you through the dullest and harshest landscape of humanity.The story of a simple man finding his soul in the strangest place on earth with the help of his practical old aunt and her dog Warren who was named after the aunt's deceased lover.The characters are out of this world for their quirkiness and somehow it all rings true.A very disturbing read and one that will stay with you for sometime.Take the journey."
1,I would give this book 0 stars if that was an option.,"One of the worst books I have ever read. How did this book ever win the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize? The story was absolutely banal. It was a struggle just to finish the book, and I wish I hadn't."
4,"Quirky, funny, maybe a touch too cute","The Shipping News is precisely and humorously written. Proulx knows how to construct a novel which walks a fine line between the comic and the painfully real: the characters never devolve into clichés, even when they are written in broad, singular strokes. But the Shipping News does suffer from an overabundance of cuteness. There is the end, of course, which was a bold narrative choice. A reader can either think it brilliant or perhaps too trite, and the road folks both ways at that point with no convergence. And this points back to a more general (but forgivable) flaw in the novel: Proulx wants everything to turn out alright, even if it does violence to her novel; even if it sacrifices the trajectory she seems to have planned. But this is a forgivable vice in this book. Its charm is apparent, even if it has the bad manners to end poorly."
1,"Very, very bad","I'm from Newfoundland and I was a little offended by this book. We are not all that ignorant, we just have a very distinct culture.As for the plot, it really wasn't great. I didn't like Quoyle and I certainly didn't enjoy his daughter or mother who were both moody, spoiled brats. And his wife irritated me everytime she was mentioned. The family moves here so Quoyle can start a new life where he originally hails from. And he also finds out that he is better than anyone expected - he gets a job and a girlfriend.If you liked the movie, don't think you'll like the book, too. The movie was not incredibly true to the book. Case in point - Kevin Spacey is not a large lumbering fool as our hero is described to be."
5,"A masterpiece, the life of the very ordinary!","I found the first 70 pages or so very tough going. I am not sure at what point, I became totally gripped by this book. I so thoroughly enjoyed it after that and plan to read it again soon.Annie Proulx build up and development of the main characters is remarkable. They jump out of the pages and speak to you. The details of everyday life in this frozen corner of the world, the chatter in the offices of the shipping news and life of an unusual family emigrating to an unlikely destination; all come across so vivid and live.No doubt this is Annie Proulx best book to date"
2,The Shipping News,"I began this book with high expectations. I was let down quickly. I stuck with the book and finished it, only to feel empty in the end. I had high hopes for the characters, especially Quoyle and his life struggles. However, a FEW interesting characters, and beautiful descriptions of Newfoundland were all I came away with. I felt as if the E. Annie Proulx chose to stop writing this book rather than ending it. Of course, how do you wrap up a novel that has no story. I would have given this book only one star had it not been for some of the characters. Perhaps this would have been a better book written as a series of short stories involoving these characters."
4,A truely amazing love story,"This novel, although a little boring at first to me, was simply an amazing love story. Quoyle wanted to give up on love altogether, but he met an amazing woman who loved him for who he was, and he, again, believed in love. Although it was extremely difficult, he wouldn't let a shallow woman and a broken heart ruin his life. He realized that his life didn't end with the death of his wife and end of his marriage. It was simply time for him to start over, and find someone who really did love him."
3,Missed the boat!,I was looking forward to this novel with great anticipation. I felt like I saw the lives of the characters only in glimpses... controlled by an author who did not develop them fully. Disappointed.
5,Brilliant,It was brilliant. My life feels emptier without this book in my hands. I've been searching for a book like this since I started reading 20 years ago. I hope it's not another 20 before I find another!
2,Dim and Slow,"I bought this game for my 5 1/2 year old daughter. First thing she noticed was it was a bit slow, even while running. I noticed the game was poorly lit. Between these two misfortunes, it doesn't matter how good the game is! We will be returning this.- Devin"
1,IT'S TOO EASY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,First of all I'm twelve and a girl and I got this game for Easter. I finished this game in ONE DAY!!!!!!!!!! (I'M SERIOUS!!!) I finished it in one day and the horse does not go very fast and Barbie walks VERY SLOWLY!!!!! AND I HATE HAVING TO REMEMBER CODES TO GET BACK INTO YOUR GAME! I hope this review was helpful!
1,This game..... was...... STUPID.,"the game was real dumb, it was impossible to control barbie asnd her freako horse, and when you climb off to lead the horse, you WALK THROUGH ITS NECK. How lame is that? And, I REALLY DO NOT think this was Barbies favortie role, either. I hate Barbie but even though i hate that game i will always luv horses. its stupid. REALLY STOOOOOOPId get that in ur thick skull and do not buy this game."
1,worst game I'f ever played,"The game is not fun at all, It's impossible to control Barbie and her horse,the first level is sooooo easy, I don't think that you can make the level without winning 1st place. Anyway the next level is ok, the 3rd level gets harder,but the 4th race is very difficult it's impossible to control her. But the worst things are that you don't have enpugh time, barbie never goes into the direction you tell her to go, and if you wanna jump over something you have to hold on to the control pat and press B at the same time.P.S.: WARNING: Don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Inversion Is For me.,"I looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my Life Gear and have no regrets in buying it. I am 6'2"" and weigh 220 lbs. and it performs beautifully for me. It is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on. It was easy to assemble and took only a short time before I was using it.I have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too. I no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders. I would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back."
4,Ease,I particularly like the ease of gently inverting and coming up again with the help of the angled hand rails. I feel safe with the stop strap so the table will not invert beyond a comfortable position. The ankle locking bar and straps are a snap and comfortable too.
3,Joe Mills,"Joe Mills was the younger brother of naturalist and ""creator-father"" of Rocky Mountain National Park, Enos A. Mills. Joe, like his brother, also lived in Estes Park, Colorado, running a summer tourist hotel while exploring the surrounding mountains. He wrote this account of mountain adventures for Boys Life magazine, and it has kind of a rough-and-ready, let-me-tell-you-how-it-was feel to it, without much depth. The long introduction and extensive notes by James Pickering are more interesting than the main text they accompany."
4,Great for new teachers!,This is an excellent source for new teachers. It is so hard to get started sometimes coming up with new ways to teach the material. This book allows you to make content fun. It's a must have for anyone teaching history!
5,A history written for children of all ages,"PEARL HARBOR CHILD is a detailed look back at the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, December 7, 1941, from the perspective a child who survived it. The photographs provide an intimate look at what life was like for Dorinda Nicholson and the text can easily be understood by children and adults alike.I loved this book. I learned more about life in Pearl Harbor before the bombing and after than from any other source. I highly recommend this book."
4,"I, too, was a Pearl Harbor child survivor","I was twelve years old the day of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. My father was a career Navy officer and we lived on the base, one mile from the U.S.S Arizona.This author has brought back so many memories for me. I would love to be able to meet her. I'm writing my own account of that day and also my life and travels growing up during the WWII. I hope to have it published by the end of 2008.Beverly Moglich - Garden Valley, CA quilter76@juno.com"
3,Wish it was longer and more in depth,"This is very much a childrens book, written simply and with a lot of pictures. What it does, it does well. But I wish, with her unique perspective, she would have written something longer and more in depth."
3,It's not my cup of tea,Thich Nhat Hanh is beloved. But he has taken great liberty with the five precepts. It is up to you whether you accept his interpretation. It certainly can't hurt. But is it what the Buddha taught? You decide.
5,Belkin IEEE 1284 Parallel Switchbox Cable,"I've yet to be disappointed in any of Belkin's cable products, and this is no exception. The construction quality of this cable is top notch and offers fantastic data transfer and shielding from outside noise."
2,Beautiful For A Day,"I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off."
2,Sticker Mess!,"I bought this puzzle for my little one since he loved it since playing with it at our local library. I was quickly disappointed when the stickers started peeling off within weeks of having it. I thought they were suppose to be ""hand painted"" guess I was wrong. I have bought my son another chunky melissa and doug puzzle but if the ""paint"" starts to come off of that one, I will no longer be purchasing their products. Super cute designs but not worth the money."
4,My 2 year old son enjoys this puzzle.,"My son likes this puzzle. The size of the pieces are great and the colors are vibrant. It is also fun to see him name the sounds the animals make. I think it is durable, it has lasted us a good 4 months so far and still is in the same condition we were given it in. My son's grandmother bought it for him new! I would recommend it!"
1,"New design, very disappointing","When I ordered this puzzle the product description said ""wood"" and ""hand painted"", the customer reviews also raved about these features. When I got the puzzle I was very disappointed to find that the puzzle pieces are MDF board, not wood or even plywood, and the puzzle board was MDF and plywood. Additionally they were not painted at all but had paper stickers that immediately started tearing off."
1,Not too impressed,i bought this puzzle truly because it was on the cheaper side and i usually like the Melissa & Doug products.Well this puzzle is chunky pieces (great for tiny hands) but the paint comes right off the pieces over time. We have had this puzzle for a few months and the paint just chips right off. We recieved the same one again as a gift and it did the same thing... i was very disappointed in this product.
1,"I agree, very disappointed that the product was changed","I will be writing a letter to the company. They should no longer be writing ""handcrafted by hand"" on their products. It is shameful and misleading. The puzzle pieces are probably machine made and and I don't see any evidence of ""hand crafting"" anymore. I just opened the package and the paper stickers are tearing off and my kids haven't played with it yet. The puzzle background is also paper and is coming off the plywood. Do not buy this product. It is not made to last 5 min."
1,absolutely terrible design,"two different units shipped; on both units the on/off switch, buried beneath the rubber housing, was inaccessible from the switch depression on the housing. this product is useless."
3,"Provided some help in buying one, but . . .","I'm looking to buy a 2002 and found some help in reading this book. Nevertheless, there is a lot of detail here that may be of some interest to enthusiasts, but was a little more than a novice like myself needs to know. Utlimately, the book is what it promises to be, ""a comprehensive guide""."
4,It's pretty alright,"I like it, there are some nifty little pieces and beats. I love the passion - lyrics are kinda trite. They do have a unique sound, but this CD is not much different than the others. Thumbs up, but no jump for joy."
4,I haven't slept this well in a year!,"A lot of people had recommended Yoga to me because I have had some stress in my life and have had trouble sleeping. I also wanted to be ""active"" again, but found it hard to work out due to a past injury and well time. I scowered the Amazon yoga videos and bought this one.My first experience with yoga was about a year ago and this guy was like a drill sargeant... and I was told that was how yoga wasn't supposed to be. So I took a chance on this video and I haven't felt sooo relaxed in about a year. This video takes you slowly through the poses which was perfect for me, becauase I am a beginner. Margurite's voice is soothing and her meditation is key after the challenging session she delievers well. I have recommended this video to several people and we all are happy with the results: relaxed, GREAT SLEEP and I have noticed my buns and legs are a bit tighter!Magurite is an inspiration and I do Yoga now about 3-4 times a week."
5,brilliant,"I shall join the ranks in giving this a great rating. I was pleasantly surprised at the level of instruction in this video, which is aimed at true yoga beginners - albeit not totally unfit. I bought this and Buns of Steel Power Yoga with a bit of a twinge of embarassment, and found them both excellent, so to hell with the name, they have pride of place on my bookshelf.This is true, well balanced hatha yoga, long smooth holds, no flows, well instructed, with modifications for different levels. She instructs the poses by mirroring them, making it easier to follow than most yoga videos, where they lean to the left and tell you tl lean to the left! And at 40 minutes it's easy to squeeze in, whereas sometimes I can't handle an hour or an hour and a half in the case of my Kripalu Dynamic! Highly recommended."
4,Relaxing - yet still challenging,"So what if it is called buns of steel yoga - it is a good video - seriously. The instructor is clear with her intructions and provides modifications when necessary. She also provides adequate rest in between each pose which you do not often find on yoga videos. This video is a bit slow-paced, however it is not boring and I found the poses to be both challenging and relaxing. If you are a beginner or intermediate yoga practicer I would recommend the tape."
4,well taught and easy to follow,"ms baca does a very good job at helping the viewer through a basic yoga class. She is very fluent and the postures are done at an easy to follow pace. The floor work segment is very well done, except for the lack of any inversions such as the shoulderstand/plough series, but she makes up for it in the end with a beautiful final relaxation with a compelling and soothing voice to guide you into complete relaxation. Highly recommended"
1,Headaches,"I have tried many yoga vidoes. I really wanted to like this video because I enjoyed doing the postures. But, every time I did the video I ended up with a horrible headache. Any all day long headache. I was told by a yoga instructor it was because there was no flow to the moves and they weren't done in a proper sequence.I finally had to stop and throw the tape away. I can't recommend this tape to anyone."
5,Excellent as usual!,"Ed McBain has done it again. The book was entertaining. Unfortunately, it was too short, and left me wanting more. I suppose that's a good thing... Anyway, BRAVA."
2,Who are all these people giving this book 4 or 5 stars?,"I am a huge fan of Ed McBain and have read every one of the87th Precinct books. But this latest offering falls far short of whatI have come to expect from the master. From the very start the book exudes an oddly dull, flattened sense of pace and it seems very much as though the author is just going through the motions. He seems tired and his characters seem uninteresting and uninspired. The real problem with The Last Dance is the more than faintly ridiculous storyline. McBain's books are usually expertly plotted but this one strikes a duff note almost from the start. To all those McBain fans out there -- you won't miss much by skipping this one. Let's hope this is just a temporary dip in form."
5,Carella and Gang Keep Plugging Away,"As a mystery writer with my first book in its initial release, I have been amazed by the works of Evan Hunter/Ed McBain for decades. He is undeniably prolific, and his works are always of top quality. THE LAST DANCE proves my points perfectly. It is McBain's 50th 87th Precinct novel, and all the usual cops are on the scene doing their things. McBain shows them living their lives and performing their jobs. THE LAST DANCE is the police procedural at its best. It's a great novel in a great series. Ed McBain's work is unbelievable."
2,Here we go again,There are absolutely no surprises in this book; it could have been written by a ghost writer. On top of that the carelessness: On page 203 Lorraine Riddock is 19 years old and has red hair. On page 212 she is in her mid-thirties and has black hair. There is absolutely no excuse for such sloppiness.
2,Nothing to get excited over,"I thought this offering from Ed McBain was disappointing and very boring. I was expecting a brilliant crime fiction novel, the way that everyone carries on about Ed McBain, but infact, I think that I could have written a better book.The story revolves around an old man that was found dead in his bed, by his daughter. But did he really die in his sleep? Or was there foul play? Who cares?I read the entire book, but guessed the ending almost straight away. I can't believe that someone who has written 80 books has produced this drivel. As far as comparing him to John Sandford - well, I don't think how that comparison can be made - chalk & cheese!If you a looking for a great crime fiction, miss this out and do get John Sandford or Michael Conolloy."
4,Enjoyable read,This was my first Ed McBain book. I enjoyed it and will probably get another. The characters were well written and the story kept me interested.
3,A solid addition to the series,"The Last Dance is the 50th police procedural from McBain and the formula still holds together. The police work is thorough and though the crime itself is a bit far-fetched(dealing with the rights to a soon to be revived play)McBain plays fair and works towards his typical solid solution. Subplots dealing with some of the problems facing the NYPD are typical McBain, usually setting something up for the next book. Not his best work in the series but all the elements that regular readers of the 87th are looking for are here."
3,Listen to the bodies falling!,"The audiobook was an excellent abridgement. McBain fans will love the plot, the characters, the wicked conclusions. But,in my humble opinion, there are some authors that should be banned from reading their work. Some of my friends love McBain's reading but I find it harsh, gargly, slobbery with some improbable accents. My ears record a resounding clank and thud. If YOU can take the author's reading then the story is worth the effort."
2,Not the best....,"As much as I love Ed McBain and all the guys from the 87th, I had a hard time finishing this particular book. I found it to drag on and on. The story started out to be somewhat intriguing, but by the middle of the book, I found it became dull and confusing. There were too many characters to become familiar with (and a few characters that need not even be written into the story!) and way too many names to remember. However, don't get me wrong! I will continue to read any and all Ed McBain books! A true fan never dies!"
3,Worth a look,"This is, as all of Michael Stewart's books are, an entertaining story that should keep you interested from start to finish with some excellent scenes in the last 50 pges of the book. I honestly do not understand why Stewart is out of print, as both this and Monkeyshines are very readable and considerably better than a lot of what is on offer at the moment."
4,Great CD!,"I bought this for the SOLE purpose of having the live CD. I saw the Documentary, months ago, on MTV and was not impressed. It was a bit too political and too BLAH for my taste. Does not show any live performances and it seems to be too philisophical. I probably will never watch it.So, my 4 stars is based on the LIVE CD alone!!!It's rare (if at all) that Madonna releases a live CD of one of her tours. So, this is a must have for any type of fan! She sounds SO great live and it's a whole new way to experience her music. Crank it up and you'll swear you are there. A great array of songs on the CD that will keep you dancing and singing.A must have!!!"
4,New but old,"The CD has some fresh new mixes of older songs, with a lot of bass. The DVD that comes with it is also great - much like Truth or Dare, but Madonna is a nicer person now. I definitely recommend this."
5,A SIN IF YOU DON'T BUY THIS CD / DVD,"I SWEAR THIS IS THE BEST DOCUMENTARY THERE IS... TRUTH OR DARE IS A CLASSIC MADONNA FILM BUT THIS IS THE BEST OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM!! VERY CANDID & VERY TRUE TO HEART FROM MADONNA!! IT LETS YOU INTO HER WORLD & BEYOND!!! OPEN YOUR HEART, BE TRUE BLUE & VOGUE!! PEACE"
3,"It's No ""Truth or Dare""","On the DVD:It's no Truth or Dare but interesting enough to see how different Madonna is now that she's become a mother. Her interaction with the camera and crew is less iconic and much more respectable. It's a completely different documentary from Truth or Dare; so, don't expect the same. This is probably something you'd more likely see in an independent theater than in a Regal Cinemas. I feel it is much less captivating ... but then the mystery and intrigue behind Madonna washed away after the birth of her first child. She's fascinating nonetheless and you get glimpses of her genius in parts of the film.Very well directed. Seemingly less concert footage than Truth or Dare but musical enough. Nobody Knows Me is a particular standout."
5,I am going to tell you a secret: First Aired On Cable,"The revention tour/documentary first aired on cable MTV and VH1I watched it and loved it. It seems Madonna has done some editing and deleting in the documentary, but that is exactly what it is a documentary. Her revention was two years ago and I am trying remember the concert from start to finish but I can't. Now if you want to see the revention tour ask Lady M to put the tour on DVD let's try shall we: Madonna can you put the revention tour on DVD? (and hopefully the blonde ambition tour to on DVD). I like both documentaries it has shown a maturiy in herself and her music and (once in a while the classic madonna) comes out. Can you be honest and say you would want the same documentary fourteen years later NO because she is always growing and changing. You will pay some money for the DVD/CD but what about her confession tour: front seats near the catwalk mmmmmmmmm. You will get your money's worth satisfied or not."
1,THE WAY A LIVE ALBUM SHOULD NOT BE DONE,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST LIVE ALBUM I HAVE HEARD IN A DECADE.I REALLY DISLIKE MADONNA WHO DOES NOT PLAY ANY INSTRUMENTS.THIS ALBUM WOULD HAVE SOUNDED BETTER IF SHE HAD INVITED DAVID GILMOUR TO PLAY THE GUITAR ON SOME SONGS.FOR A GOOD ALBUM GET PINK FLOYD PULSE FOR A GREAT LIVE EXPERIENCE.THIS MADONNA ALBUM IS DISGRACEFUL,AVOID IT.THANK YOU."
1,you're gonna retire,"boy madonna did it all broke every taboo, joined every satanic cult, slept with every man and woman in hollyhwood and put out crappy cd's since 82 yeah madonna you wrote a book about sex paving the way for little trampy singers like britney, and christina yeah way to go you have 2 kids by different fathers been married twicve and made crappy movies go madonna."
1,Madonna needs to give it up!,"I saw this ""documentary"" when it was on TV. Madonna and her new ""English"" accent and ""I'm better than you attitude"" has finally gotten on my last nerve. She used to be a DIVA, now she is just and old preachy hen who wants to shove her Kabalah ways down her fans thoats! Face it, her glory days are long gone and it is only her die hard fans who still hold on to her ""Blonde Ambition"" days who still seem to think she is any good.There is a scene where her daughter tries to talk just like her mother. She rants on and on, just like Madonna that all of a sudden Roco, Madonna's son, tells his sister to shut up! Well done, now he just needs to tell his mother the same thing!"
2,RE-INVENTION DISAPPOINTMENT,Just want to request for the OFFICIAL RE-INVENTION TOUR DVD to be released. This one is a big disappointment. I thought this will include the complete concert.
3,Madonna's Get Together,"For those who have the domestic CD single of Madonna's Get Together than u know how terrible the dance/club mixes are. Well, u can go to http://rapidshare.de/files/29674159/GET_TOGETHER_RAUHOFER_FINAL.mp3.html and download for free the Get Together Peter Rauhofer club mix clocking over 9 minutes. This isn't available anywhere else unless. I hope i've help all you Madonna disco dancing loving Madonna fans."
3,EH.....,"It's my mistake for buying it. So, unless your a fan/collector - don't bother - the concert version of her music isn't that great. Beside, 1/3 of the songs on the CD weren't big singles, ie: recognizable to the general fan. It's emabrrassing hearing her try to whine on tunes that are 20 years old.... She's a money making machine, not a well crafted tune machine - please keep this in mind before you buy $$"
2,Preach Preach Preach,"The CD is great, no doubt about it. The DVD is padded with poems and gospel preachings. EH! Just fast forward to the concert footage, unless you're a ""born again"" too."
1,Are we being Stiffed!,THis isn't the full tour according to the specs I've found online. So I take it we don't even get the full concert show! Where is Burning Up? I love Truth or Dare but I own the Blond Ambition Tour on LaserDisc to see it. I'm gonna Tell you a Secret was I'm sorry interesting in some parts but was let down more so by lack of concert footage and NOW we aren't even gonna be able to see the full concert! Whats Gives ! If you can't release a show the correct way don't release it at all.
2,Self Help from a Self Absorbed Celebrity?,"What's the secret? This film is abominable! I like Madonna but was hugely disappointed by this documentary. It's not even a documentary -- it's a preachy infomercial for Kabbalah. I was way more interested in the technical, behind the scenes tour documentation of the Re-Invention Tour. Unfortunately, these scenes are too few and she is left maundering about herself for two hours.The absolute worst part of the film is when she says something ""important"", annoying script / handwriting duplicates what she says on the screen. Should we take notes, Madonna? We aren't all arrogant, self-absorbed, greedy, social climbers that need a spiritual awakening in order to be a decent human being.The film teeters on interesting when we see her interacting with her family. I just find her every move (on film, at least) to be very affected and calculated, which is especially sad when she interacts with her children. Get over yourself, Madonna."
4,good cd,"Would have gave 5 stars but the DVD that came with the CD did not work, I tried playing it on 2 different machines...but the item was new....not sure why it didn't work. CD is fine and that is what I really wanted."
5,Great product,"Amazing documentary/concert DVD. A true insight into Madonna the performer, the person and the artist. Good musical numbers, good interview sequences. Worth the price."
4,Great package,"The documentary was very very good and it could make a better person out of you! It's very spiritual but very complex like Madonna herself. The audio cd is very good, but it sounds so polished that you wonder how much of her actual singing voice was dubbed or tampered with. It could've been better but now we only have to wait endlessly for the reivention tour dvd to come out!"
4,The secret is...,"I'm Going To Tell You a Secret by Madonna is a CD/DVD combo following the Queen of Pop on her Re-Invention Tour in 2004. Madonna is a stunning performer, no one does it better than her. Vogue, Crazy For You, and Nobody Knows Me are some of the tracks I enjoy. Backstage footage is also shown and many more. Highly recommend for Madge fans only, enjoy!"
5,A Hidden Treasure on This One,"On this CD/DVD combo there is a hidden treasure. A treasure that I feel is worth the price alone. Madonna pays tribute to a beautiful song, sung as only she can. Prefaced by the comment that we all need to try to make a better world, Madonna does a wonderful rendition of John Lennon's timeless ""Imagine"". A song so suited for Madonna and what I feel she attempts to stive for... making the world better.I recommend this for that song alone. Everything else is Madonna standard fair. Top notch sound quality and food for thought."
1,a disappointing con,"first of all where is the American life video?,where are the full length versions of concert footage that wasn't in the broadcast?.madonna why do you hate the dvd format so much?.this was the first music dvd from you in 5 years!you can do better than this.the only reason for buying this dvd+cd is for the live cd which sounds great.give us the re-invention tour dvd if it was ever filmed in the first place!"
3,What happened to the full performances????,"They shouldn't have even bothered releasing the dvd, other than the few lame bonus scenes it's the same version that was on mtv/logo! The live cd is great, but the dvd is a total disappointment!"
3,The music should have been the real star,"I enjoyed ""....secret"" for the most part. Its certainly nice to see Madonna all growed up. She has more life under her belt and more wisdom to share. Here is my gripe. Alek Keshishian, whom directed the far superior Truth or Dare, filmed the concert footage brilliantly. Here though, the concert footage seems ameteur. No interesting angles, every shot comes from center stage right in front of Madonna. On top of that all the concert footage is edited down. Vogue lost around a third on its length. Fortunately ""Nobody Knows Me"" was shown in its entirety."
1,extremely tiny,"I bought this hoping to display near a train set that I have wrapped around my xmas tree. This is super tiny, the product dimensions on amazon has it listed as 5 x 5 x 7 inches, but that is incorrect. Id say its about 1 x1 x1 inches. It also did not come with the benches."
2,Half Painted,"I was excited when I ordered this item, once I opened it I was very disappointed. The people were not painted all the way and there was no benches that came with this item, like it stated. This item was a gift for my father, I am very unhappy."
4,Like sweet tea? Try this out for something different.,"This tea is very, very good. This specific brand and flavor is currently brewed in McDonald's on the island of Kauai, Hawaii as an iced tea (I would imagine other the islands as well but I cannot say that for sure).I was able to find this locally on the island during our last visit and brought a couple of boxes home. I use one bag at a time in a Keurig machine to make a great cup of iced tea. Add some sugar for additional sweetness; according to the box, sweetener brings out the passion fruit to new levels.I was already fan of the passion fruit tea found at our local Panda Express restaurants but this is a few notches better. If you like passion fruit flavored tea, definitely give this a try."
5,Taste of the Island!,"I found this tea while vacationing in Oahu, and it is wonderful!Thankfully Amazon carries this line, so I can order a little piece of paradise for when I'm back home. The aroma from the hot tea is fabulous, and it tastes great iced too."
4,A quick read,"Short (116 pp), and not much of a message, except that excessive egoism takes an inevitable fall. In the background, the author creates a mildly interesting period piece with an intriguing atmosphere. But the story focuses on a series of relationships our hero has with about six different girls, and their only remotely believable resolution.Cute and nicely written. OK for a quick read with an interesting setting."
2,laborious,"Although at times the plot proved intriguing, Finney dragged out his story with great detail over little action. The character development was weak, and the timing poor. Definitly not a classic."
2,Original concept bogged down by poor editing & lack of plot,"As with many other reviewers, I found the concept of this book - time travel back to NYC in 1882 - intriguing. Unfortunately, the actual reading of this book was a disappointment.Here's my guess on what happened. Take a New York writer, a New York editor and a New York publisher. Someone forgot that some of the readers might not know or care about every last corner and building in New York City. Hence, many incredibly detailed descriptions were allowed to stay in the book that should have gone to the cutting room floor.The first 250 pages of this book were painfully slow for me. At least the final 100 pages had both action and philosophy and read smoothly.Bottom line -- probably a good book for those who know and love Manhattan. As for the rest of us, I'm sure better books of time-travel and mystery and romance are out there."
2,Boring time and again,"I love anything to do with time travel, I find it fascinating, but this book couldn't have made it a more boring subject. In the book, the government has spent a lot of money on setting up environments condusive to time travel to get people in right frame of mind, and goes into huge detail of everything they have setup, but then basically shows that is all for nought, because you just need the ""right"" person with the right ability. When you're reading that much boring detail, you at least hope that it serves you well for later in the book, but no, it was just that, a bunch of boring, useless detail.The book does get interesting, like others have said, during the last 1/3 of the book, but it took me a long time to get there as I kept putting the book down out of boredom and coming back to it days later determined to finish it.Overall, not a book I'd recommend unless you're a history buff of that time period."
3,A Minority View,"The volume I read had 400 pages, of which at least 200 were descriptions of old-time New York City, seemingly down to the last brick. The balance between description and plot was therefore significantly tilted to description, and I must therefore admit I skimmed portions of the book as a result. In summary, I found this a tedius read which could have greatly benefited from 100 pages of editing."
2,Possibly the Most Annoying Hero In SF,"Not a bad book, quite charming in places, though there are more interesting time travel novels around, Robert Silverberg's ""Up the Line"" for example. What really got me was the willingness of the pathetic self centred little twerp who is the ""hero"" to sacrifice (for all he knew) millions of lives and alter the course of history to gratify his puerile romantic impulses in respect of some woman from the past he's only known for a day."
3,outdated,"This book was published in 1970--so I felt like I was going back in time twice. I couldn't relate to any of the characters or scenes because I wasn't even alive in 1970. The book often referred to ""the eighties"", which to them was the 1880's because the 1980's didn't exist yet. I had to pause and remind myself of this often. Therefore the time travel that actually took place in the book didn't have as much impact.The book has a great premise, and was probably a wonderful read when it was first published--but 38 years later, it has definitely lost some of it's appeal."
1,One of my favorite BOOKS ... but the abridged tape )c:,"I read TIME & AGAIN every few years, and it's magic every time. But the abridged cassette version ... the editor cut the heart out of this book. Finney's wonderful wordplay, his story-telling and sense of what details to include are lost in the stripped down version. What's saddest is that so many people will only listen to this cassette version, and never know they're missing one of the most enjoyable books of the last 50 years."
1,What a waste of time......,"I have to agree with reviewer ""Michael D. Ward."" This book was such a disappointment!! I read the back cover and was so excited to read this because the concept was so unique. As I always do when I buy a new book, I logged on to Amazon.com and read the reviews. I must admit because the reviews were so outstanding I chose to ignore Michael's review. Too bad! He was right. The author went into way too much detail about the most boring and trivial things! I actually read the entire book but would literally skip pages at a time to get through it. What a waste of time, the ending was just as boring as the beginning and middle.Don't waste your time!"
1,Excrutiatingly dull novel.,"""Time and Again"" is a novel that starts of well and quickly starts to drag, once the main character, Si, finally goes back in time (about a third of the way into the book) the stroy seems poised to really take off. Instead, the story comes to a grinding halt, as Finney starts describing everything in excrutiating detail.At first the details are themselves interesting as Finney brings 1882 New York to life, but after chapter upon chapter of trivial details even the most avid student of 19th century history has to become bored. And it just seems to get worse as the novel progresses: Eventually, Si can't walk down the street without Finney spending several pages telling the reader ALL about it.When Finney does find time to tell his story, the book doesn't fair any better since the story itself isn't any good. The characters are two-dimensional and unbelievable. This is an all around pointless book and huge let down. I'm flabbergasted that some many people praise this book."
5,An Intriguing Journey,"Jack Finney's tale is a combination mystery and travelogue into the past. The formula works like magic, except for the added political philosophizing near the end. It's one of the most creative, intriguing novels I've read. Highly recommended."
5,thought provoking,"In his brilliant novel ""Time and Again"" author Jack Finney weaves a tapistry of mystery, suspense and intrigue into an enigmatic journey thru the portals of time, space and the limits of the human mind. From his lair [ The Dakota] overlooking Central Park, Simon literally wills himself back to the 19th century. His mission could change who we are, the society we live in, or the fate of the human race itself. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a good mystery wrapped in the limitless possibilities of our imagination. Whenever I pass The Dakota on one of my trips into the city I always make it a point to look up and wonder if there is someone walking among us who might be a visitor from the 21st centry."
4,slow but moving story of time travel,"Books that deal in time travel have to adress the paradox of changing the future.This slowly and intelligently does that in a way that not only delights, but in a way repeats the ethics discussed during the story. I found the book slow and boring at times, yet it was compelling and utterly beautiful at others. I fully believed by the end of the book that the main charactor had gone back to 1882 New York City.You will never look at a centurys old city the same again."
2,Overrated,"This book has its moments, but they are few and distant from each other. The devotion of page after page to the transformation of the NYC landscape are only of interest to those who are familiar with its layout; even tourists would not have the intimate knowledge needed to really appreciate the described changes. Yet such descriptions are unrelenting. AND, given the number of characters who are said to ""grin"" at this and that, I must conclude that the whole lot of them are loaded on amphetamines."
4,Purchased as a gift,"I purchased this book for my brother. He really likes the author and said he enjoyed the book. Other than that, it sounds like an interesting book."
5,How Had I Missed This One?,"I've been intrigued by stories of time travel and/or apocalypse since I was a teenager in 1950 (""Earth Abides""). It's difficult for me to comprehend that I didn't discover ""Time and Again"" of 1970, which may well be the best of these genres, until here in 2007! I recommend it highly. Even stronger recommendations are unknowingly provided by some of its one-star reviews, so don't overlook them."
3,"Great if you're an old NYC fan, but I was disappointed","I love time travel books and I'm fascinated by history, so I thought this work would be a perfect match. Unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, Finney gets bogged down in page after page of tediously detailed descriptions. There were some pretty big holes in the plot - the ""just close your eyes and you'll be magically transported"" was just too simple a plot device, and the casual way the main character treats history-changing decisions was infuriating to me (""but I LOVE her, who cares what I do to the history of the entire world!"").I did thoroughly enjoy the concept, was fascinated with the (albeit far too detailed) glimpse into 1880s New York, and the ending gave me lots to think about. I just wish Finney had had a better editor.In short, a good read if you are a rabid fan of historical New York fiction, otherwise - a decent enough pasttime, but there are better time travel novels out there."
3,"""Oh call back yesterday...""","Inevitably based on the play / film ""Berkeley Square"" and select episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"", this is a lovingly researched novel and an enjoyable tale. Simon Morley is plucked from his uninspiring job as an advertising agency artist by a mysterious government official with an offer not to be refused...to travel by act of will into another time. To succeed, Morley must create the very essence of 1882 New York in his mind; the texture and colour of a past age. I welcome the news that this book is to be brought to the screen. So long as it is sensitively handled, it will benefit from a large Hollywood budget; with the Statue of Liberty making it's biggest cinematic impact since ""Planet of the Apes"". This book lacks the emotional core of the later novel ""Bid Time Return"" by Richard Matheson (who wrote for ""The Twilight Zone"") and the exploration of inescapable fate and paradox theory. To thoroughly explore this theme I would recommend for anyone to read both titles."
2,Love Letter to New York,"This book will appeal to readers who like a slower, more descriptive story, especially those who love New York, because the author describes the city as it was in 1882 in minute detail, and works a famous fire in the World Building into the plot.Unfortunately, I found it to be boring and dated; the references to the typing pool or someone's ""girl"" unintentionally hilarious. I was frequently reminded ofSomewhere In Time(another time travel book in which the time travel mechanism is not explained other than a sort of self-hypnosis), but it did not have the romance story to keep me interested (or much plot at all)."
5,Be Taken Away,"If at all possible, find a quiet room and a friend who will read this to you. Close your eyes, travel through time and get lost in this wonderful adventure."
4,The grand-daddy of time travel as cultural exploration,"One of the first to employ time travel not merely as ascience-fictional trope, but a means to explore a time and place inthe past. The time travel element itself is kind of weak; you essentially ""think"" yourself there."
4,good time travel book,the book was well written and interesting.After reading Steven King's recent time travel book 11\23\64 I noticed he had recommended Time and again. I will say King took parts .f some of his themes but Steven's book was more iinteresting & exciting
4,Excellent story but disappointing,"Having read Finney's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, I expected the best. And this book presented an unexpected twist on time travel. (No, I won't reveal it.) But, just before the end, in chapter 21, the plot takes a disappointing turn, as protagonist Si gets preachy and politically correct. (Maybe because it was written in 1970?) It was downhill from there, except for an unexpected O.Henry-type ending. But I'm still a Jack Finney fan! (I read a trade paperback edition.)"
4,I love this book,"I read this book over 20 years ago, both my husband and I love it. I am buying it again to read it with another frame of mind."
4,Nice concept of time travel,"One of the trendiest ways to view time nowadays is not as an unstoppable river, but rather a set of discrete moments that are joined together in a series only by our mental picture of reality. In this story, the protagonist accomplishes time travel via a hypnotic state where he eliminates all prejudice and preconceived notions he has about the current time and puts his mind in the frame of 1882.It's a nice story with some mystery flavor, some romance flavor, though I found the ending to be less than ideal on the romantic front. The illustrations and photos lend a nice touch to the story, to give you a better vision of exactly what the characters see."
5,Favorite Book of All Time,I read this book years ago but still hold it as my favorite book of all time. I cannot think of another book that describes detail in a way that you feel you are not reading at all but actually watching a movie. I highly recommend this book!
5,One of the best novels ever written,This is a true classic. Jack Finney's description of New York City in the late 19th century makes you feel as though you are really there. The pictures in the book are the icing on the cake. Si Morley's journey comprises the best time travel tale ever concieved. A gem that you will enjoy over and over.
1,time travel for dummies,"As other customer reviews have noted, this novel is occasionally charming. But it is hard to ignore that the mechanism of time travel, which is central to the story, is barely examined - let alone explained. This renders the book whimsical fantasy. It is also - no pun intended - dated, if only for the sexist descriptions of what makes the female characters attractive to the jerk who tells this tale. The accompanying appropriated illustrations and photographs are feebly selected with insipid captions. I never believed for one second that ""Si"" made a living as a commercial artist. ""Time and Again"" is unusually lame for a cult novel and I don't understand its popularity."
2,Great-UNTIL THE END!,"I enjoyed the book immensely...until the end. He ruined the book! With the horrible ending and solidified with stupidity by making that guy not meet his wife, how stupid is that! VERY!!!!!!!"
5,A Masterpiece of Atmosphere.,The story is magical. The settings are magical. And the characters are real. They will live with you as long as you live and you will search in vain for another book that will surpass this one. Search in vain for I doubt that any other novel of the last 50 years is as fully realized as this
3,Better the First Time,"The first time I read this book, five years or so ago, I thought it was wonderful. I even made my mom, who reads very little fiction, buy a copy and she loved it as well. I just read it again for the second time, and I have to say, there were several flaws in the logic of the story that I either did not pick up on or just did not care about the first time around. (I am not going to enumerate them because the book is much more enjoyable if you do not see them.) A little long and a little wordy, it is nevertheless a pretty good read if you do not read too deeply."
4,Nice kit....nice bag....,"I really like this kit, it only gets 4 stars due to company substituting glue-less patches for the ones shown in description. Had to purchase separately. The bag is real nice soft and durable with zipper. U-tube has great video's of this kit in use, wow makes quick work of flats! The tire levers seems pretty sturdy and the inflator is versatile my local bike shop sells the 16 for the CO2, which is cool. I was able to add item to the bag as well. No more bike pumps for me, at least not on bike.Bottom line: Kit worth every penny, would purchase again to give as gifts to other cyclists!"
5,Wow,"I love this thing comes with every thing u need. The air pump is great I got 2 mtbs. My one bike was very lo on air so i had to try it. loaded up the pump verey easy, it aired up the tire in les than a sec and the back tire to. The pump is veary small fits in my seat bag,good fore the trail. Great buy!"
1,So where's the glue?,"Back here in Iowa, my rear tire was punctured by a staple on the ride back from the store. Had my Genuine Innovations Tire Repair & Inflation Wallet with me to no avail.When I opened the Wallet, I had everything I needed except for the glue. Scuffed the tube puncture area. Instead of spreading a thin layer of glue to the scuff area and letting it dry, I resorted to applying a patch to the unglued puncture area. Removing the backing from the patch exposed the sticky side that seemed to adhere to the tube well enough, but alas the patch gave out after less than a minute back on the road. Luckily I only had a mile to walk the bike back to the house."
2,Lots of fun until the last 30 pages.,"I enjoyed this book when I read it about five years ago. It is a well crafted story that was apparently very difficult to finish because Kesey couldn't even do it. Remember how you felt at the end of the movie ""The Abyss""? Get ready for an equally dissapointing finish to a great effort"
3,"Interesting, but not his best","While I found this book interesting, it doesn't rise to the level of ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or ""Sometimes a Great Notion."" The book was interesting, but then tails off at the end. The ending was rather ant-climatic and leaves several story lines hanging. It presents a rather bleak view of the future from an environmental stand point for sure. It would also seem he has a rather low opinion of most of humanity based on his characters in this and the previously mentioned two books. Unfortunately I would tend to agree with him on that."
1,Terrible dissappointment,"Firstly, this is a science fiction book by Ken Kesey. That's a bit odd. There are quite a few characters in the book, some of whom are not very well sketched out. There are several odd plot lines that develop, a handful of which get some closure. What really happens is that several possibilities are outlined, and then I guess Ken just got tired and decided to just end the book. Bam! It's done. Some new story line pops up and within a handful of pages the whole book is dropped suddenly to a close. It did have a decent start and, although it was a bit bombastic, had some appealing moments. But I would *not* recommend this book. Especially if you've read other Kesey books."
1,Sailor Song,This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. I would suggest that you pick another novel . This one was a complete waste of time. Do not waste your money on it. If you desire to read it then take it out of the library so you do not waste any money.
1,"not even close---try ""the shipping news""","really a pot boiler, ken must have really needed the money for some more drugs!! don't get me wrong, i love ken and almost everything that he has written( nest,notion,box)but would not waste my money on this tail dragger."
3,buyer beware,"The cd is pretty good, but beware, it has a cds-100 copy protection that will not let you rip it to use on any a media player. As far as fair use goes this gets an F minus minus."
5,Won't be Sorry,"How many times have you bought a CD for a great song only to find out the rest of the cd stinks. Not so with Closure. I heard ""Look Out Below"" on the Darkness Falls movie and was hooked. I ran out to FYE only to find they didn't carry it. Thank goodness for Amazon. You will not be sorry, I haven't found one song that I don't like. Hope to hear more from this band."
4,"Good solid stuff, but nothing exceptional","Closure's debut album is decent stuff, and is certainly worth the money, but don't expect any surprises here. ""Look Out Below"" is an awesome song. Its also, by far, the best song on the CD; nothing else (aside from possibly ""Whatever Made You"") comes close. Most of the other nine songs here are worth a listen if you like the band, but while they definitely aren't filler songs, they aren't anything special, either.If there was ever a time for me to be able to give a 3.5, this would be it. But since that's not going to happen, I give Closure a 4."
4,"A man, a house ,and a special time.","Astonishing to think that about thirty years ago so many young people in The West were moved to engage with people such as Mr Bennett. Definitely something in the air at that time.Allen Roth conjures up the spirit of those years in a book which will bring back memories of early spiritual endeavours for some, and will encourage the latest generation to follow its instincts. The like of Mr Bennett doesn't seem to be around at the moment but ""Sherborne"" will give the reader a yardstick by which to measure ""teachers""."
3,Just Sheet Music,"I collect all things Pat Benatar - and was thrilled to see this book issued (I had given up on any finding recent sheet music). And the book contains all the 19 songs from the disc (one is missing apparently). A drawback is that the cd and book only contain songs through ""Wide Awake In Dreamland"" (missing are songs from ""True Love"", ""Gravity's Rainbow"", ""Innamorata"" and ""Go""). But Most disappointing it that the book lacks pictures. I know most people who buy these books aren't really interested in a bio or pics, but for collectors it's a let down. So if your looking for the chords for 19 of Pat's best including ""Sex As A Weapon"" and ""All Fired Up"" this is a great place to start - but if your looking for info or pics of Pat through the years you won't find it here."
2,Poor Product Description,"I purchased this bean bag after my previous bean bag ripped open exposing the beans everywhere.I have to admit to being quite disappointed with this product when it arrived. The product is described as being an adult sized bean bag. I'm a 23 year old, I'm 5ft 6"" 135lbs and I barely fit in this bean bag.This really is suitable only for kids in terms of size...also in the product description it does say that the shipping weight is 50pounds, although I have not weighed the beanbag I can confirm that this bean bag is absolutely no more than 10 pounds in weight.For $99.90 + $30 shipping I found this product to be EXTREMELY over-priced. My last beanbag was a full size which allowed to rest my legs on it while it also supported my upper body and I bought it at target for $20 and even though 2 years later it ripped it was a far better buy than this product can ever hope to be.I hope this helps you in your purchasing decision."
4,"Enjoyable In A Kind Of Rough, Slightly Primitive Way","Good fun, just not quite as polished and interesting as ""Have Gun, Will Travel"". Steve is what makes this show special although his lack of even an intermittent sidekick and the lack of scenery causes this show to not have the chemistry of ""Tall Man"" (where Clu Gulager WAS Billy the Kid, Barry Sullivan portrayed Pat Garret). Great to have the young Steve on DVD."
3,Episode List,"Please, somebody write an episode list so we know the names of the episodes in the first season."
5,One of the best Series from the 50's,This is one of the best Western series from the 50's but when is Season 2 and Season 3 coming out? We have been waiting for this to happen for two years now.
3,Wanted: Dead or Alive - Season 1,"Excellent Product, good acting. You can skip over the many company introductions unlike season 2 or 3 which you cannot do. The DVD case is very poor quality and breaks the mounting holes and eventually breaks the DVD's. DVD's must be taken out of it's case very very carefully! The DVD's are double sided and you have to watch for smudges and scratches during use."
4,They don't make 'em like this anymore,What a great classic! The good-guy bad-guy :-) Bounty hunter with a soft heart. This is Good TV.
5,McQueen A Star Right Out Of The Gate!,"Steve McQueen may have been young and inexperienced when he shot this first season, but his acting didn't look like it needed much work.This TV series was the beginning of McQueen making a name for himself and honing his craft. After this, he began acting in films and became a big star. As ""Josh Randall"" in this western series, which ran about three years, he showed us the same guy we saw star in those films: a guy who was smooth, natural-sounding and a great actor.McQueen also had the benefit of some good writing in this series. The 39 episodes have a lot of variation and they feature some well-known guest actors. The older you are, the more you'll recognize these faces. Overall, it's very entertaining and well worth the money."
3,That's All Right Scotty !!!,"I recently purchased this CD, The Guitar That Changed the World, having owned the Complete Sun Sessions for years and loving the guitar playing of Scotty Moore. The music is mixed well, and there are some really tasty leads on 'My Baby Left Me' and 'Hound Dog', nothing unexpected, just more, well...Moore !!! The only draw back to this CD is the annoying Jordanaires singing and ruining what would be an incredible instrumental album. If you love rockabilly, or just love Scotty's guitar playing you will be able to look past the background singers. if not, be forwarned !I would have given this a 5 star review if not for the Jordanaires."
2,so dull.,"I saw ads for this band and heard they are from New York - which is weird because I live in NYC and had NEVER seen or heard of them before, and I remember seeing first shows by the strokes, interpol, yeah yeah yeahs and on and on. I'm not sure why they were signed, except that maybe their label wanted to cash in on some of the New York bands hype of the past 2 years - because this cd is so completely boring I want my money back. It's just lifeless guitar jangle with no hooks and even if they have britpop influences - it doesn't show. They come off like a manufactured boy band - except with messy hair and guitars and telling people they're from Brooklyn."
3,Only if you need your shotgun to be short.,This is probably the best after market folding stock for the Remington or Mossberg shotguns. It is much better than the plastic ATI ones I have also experimented with. The problem is- that folding stock shotguns are a pretty bad idea to begin with. The recoil of a shotgun begs a comfortable cheek weld and this doesn't do much to provide it. Installation required some thinking as there were no clear direction (undo the screw on the swivel) but once I got it on it was solid. I put 15 rounds of 00 buck through it and thought I was going to have to get dentures. I have since wrapped it with soft weather seal tape and parachute cord as added cushion and it is acceptable.If you need to have a shorter shotgun (I want one that can be turned around in a car) this is a good way to go... otherwise stick with a solid stock.
2,Be warned,"I'm sure other people have adequately reviewed this book. I haven't read the reviews and don't want to. I have my own opinion of it. The warning is: there's a swear word about two-thirds of the way through the book; a totally unnecessary one. I hate it when children's books have ""bad"" swear words (or any, actually) in them. Also, I think they're calling it a fantasy, but it's Science Fiction--I mean, a name like ""organazoomers"" to describe tree cells that transport people . . . that's a sci fi name! So don't buy this book. If you want to, read it, but it's not in the same class as Harry Potter. It is poorly plotted, none of the characters are very likeable and Earthaven may be worth saving to the people that live there, but it was too easy to feel that they were really nasty people who weren't worth saving."
5,An enchanting new fantasy novel.,"Natalie thinks she is just an ordinary girl. She lives an ordinary life with her father, stepmother, and stepbrother. She misses her dead mother terribly. Her father has not been himself since she died. Natalie does not know that her mother had come from another world. One day in the supermarket parking lot, Natalie notices a glimmering wrapper. She has no knowledge that noticing this will lead to her being kidnapped. Natalie's captor knows that she has inherited her mother's power. He wants to force her to join his Spellclave, which will then destroy the magical world Natalie's mother came from, Earthaven. She escapes, aided by her captor's son, Merlin, who is as much a prisoner as Natalie herself is. Together, the two journey to Earthaven, where they discover a world unlike anything they ever imagined. But can they save Earthaven and return to their own world in time? I highly reccomend this enchanting book to readers who enjoy fantasy novels."
3,It's okay but it's not worth the money,"I have read Song Quest by Katherine Roberts and it was amazing, so I spent almost twenty dollars buying this book which I thought would also be amazing. I can't believe I wasted so much of my own money on this. It's okay, but it isn't amazing and it isn't worth the money. I don't want to waste too much time talking about the plot so I'll make it simple. Basically, this girl named Natalie goes into another world where people use spells and have animals that talk. She has to stop the bad guy from killing the magic tree. That's it. What really disappointed me is that although this is a book about magic, Natalie never uses any magic or does anything of great importance. This book is also a bit difficult to read because it's hard to keep going, even if you're on an exciting part(of which there are very few). Now don't get me wrong, this book was okay and it had a surprise ending that I liked. Read it, but wait untill you can get it at the public library."
2,Color Blind Vender,I've been looking for a RED ball for my son's westi and when I saw the picture of a red ball I ordered it and received a purple ball. If the dog can tell the difference I was hoping the vender could too.
3,Definitely suffers from being a sequel,"The best reason I don't like sequesl is that they all seem to be about the author cashing in on a successful formula. The author usually has to concoct some kind of interim plot to connect the original book with the sequel, and it usually bombs. This book is no different. After the fine ending to Time and Again, Finney has to somehow get our hero back to his own time, but that time does not exist anymore. Well.............let's just say it's not as fun. Here's to hoping there are no more Simon Morley adventures."
4,"Not as electrifying as the original, but good nonetheless","While not as strong as the original, From Time to Time paints an accurate picture of 19th and early 20th century NYC in an enjoyable and pleasant style.Time and Again is superb, and it appears that bweiss@wpp.com missed the point. Time and Again is the grandfather of the current crops of NYC historical novels, and while Finney'style may not be as good as Doctorow's, he is miles ahead of Caleb Carr."
3,Lukewarm sequel,"Finney's original book, Time and Again, is considered a classic by many, although I find it is poorly written and gimmicky while lacking rigorous thought about time travel. This book is more of the same. One gets the feeling that Finney wrote plot lines for the sole purpose of being able to incorporate old photos and drawings into his book. Maybe high school students will think the story is neat and thought-provoking, and maybe I'm a jaded grown-up, but I think the story is simplistic. Also, the poor writing (like that of a precocious high school student, not a serious fiction writer) makes this book difficult to read for more than an hour at a time"
1,A terrible let down,"The original book was wonderful, spell binding. This book is terrible. Poorly written, padded, inconsistent, and poorly plotted. The author attempts to provide motivation for Si to go back to 1912, but never provides the plant for his supposed reason for going back. What is this book? A man with a camera wandering around. It seems like half the book is just quotes from old newspaper articles of 1912. Bad!"
3,white lights,"No, From Time to Time cannot compare to its prequel, but that doesn't make it a bad book, just an average one. To readers of Time and Again, the concept of time travel as Finney depicts it has lost some of its novelty, some of its edge. Nevertheless, this chance to experience, through Si (a likeable, intelligent, character), famous icons like the Titanic before it sank and the Great White Way when it was actually blazing white, makes this book interesting and fun. It's an easy, quick read, definitely worth a look."
3,"Does not quite measure up to the prequel, but...","...it still is an entertaining story. I had read the previous reviews and thought against purchasing this book. I'm glad I changed my mind. Despite the prescence of a compelling mystery/plot as its predecessor (those went undeveloped or unexplored in this book), the story is nonetheless another wonderful journey into the past, with detailed and vivid descriptions of the way things were. I found it to be easy reading, another late night page turner, just as the previous story. If you enjoy Jack Finney's descriptions of a man journeying back to explore another world, another time, and can make it through until he springs the surprises on the reader, you should enjoy this book."
2,Skip the Sequel,"I happened across Finney's Time and Again and it was a delight...highly original, vivid in its descriptions of 19th century New York with an engaging plot and characters. This sequel is a messy follow-up that is just too forced. One of its characters states that he dislikes the word ""nostalgia"" but that is what this whole effort communicates. Finney gets tied up in a cloying, irritating homage to simpler times that is meandering and uninteresting. I wish I had not picked it up and had only the memory and experience of the first book. One interesting item of note, I believe Stephen King was influenced by one thing that takes place in From Time to Time...the main character hums and sings a song from his future era which causes his wife concern. That same ploy was used in King's 11/22/63."
4,Take a journey through time to Old New York.,"Strongly recommend if you are interested in the many insightful details about urban life in the late 19th-century and 1912. People often forget that if it were possible to travel back in time, it would be like visiting a different culture. You will find this to be more intriguing than the discussion of time travel itself or the two chapters about the protagonist's journey on the Titanic."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","""Time and Again"" was probably Finney's masterpiece, and the idea of a sequel is interesting. However, this sequel is based upon a rather weak premise to begin, and it never really gets off the ground. The problem with any sequel is that it is automatically subject to comparison with the original, and ""Time After Time"" just does not live up to its predecessor."
1,Disappointing Sequel to a wonderful book,"Time and Again is a charming glimpse into the past and is one of my all-time favorite books. Buy it! I've re-read it several times, so when this supposed sequel came out, I immediately bought it. I just tried reading it again. It's an un-charming, disjointed, unhappy excuse for a sequel. The cover art is nice.Unlike other ""reviewers"" who imply that one of the strengths of this novel is its pleasant ""what-if"" journey into the past, I found it boring and scanned through many, many pages in hopes of finding the excitement of discovering a new era. I love historical fiction! Instead I was ""treated"" to lengthy ramblings on vaudeville and a potentially sad Christmas in 1918. Yuuk! I even miss good old Jake!I sincerely hope that Mr Finney will write another (and better) Simon Morley sequel, but I'll read the reviews first."
2,Don't read !!!,"I loved Time and Again and would never bespeak any ill of it, but I find it difficult to believe that the same author could have written From Time To Time. The only aspect of this sequel I liked was the way it conveyed life in 1912. There were many inconsistencies in the story, and esp. regarding the main character in the 1st book and this sequel. Did anyone else notice that accd. to Time and Again, Si's father took him to the Big Apple in the 1950's to see the el but in the sequel his father was a vaudivillian who died when Si was an infant? It seems to me that Finney should've reread the original before writing the sequel, and that he was just grasping for any sort of a tale. Maybe the reader should check their intelligence at the door with their coats before reading it as well."
1,"In an Alternate Universe, this Book was Never Written - Make it so, please","Others here have carefully pointed out what a waste of trees this was. I agree with them all.One additional point I wanted to make was that once his original intervention from the first book was itself intervened, no way should his history continued like it had before, with him having that son and all else the same.The high point, such as it was, on the ship with that guy, was a complete dud. The recognition of the Jata lady as a fellow time traveler could have been better written by my six year old."
3,"Not stellar, but good.","It's not ""Time and Again"" but an OK read. If you were quite taken with the first book, the sequal will not live up to it's standards."
2,Gone is the excitement from the Finney's first novel,"Not much here to impressed me. Plenty of information on New York during the early 1900's. Information on the clothing, dancing, entertainment, information that seems useless unless you are interested in art history of the early 20th century. Gone is the excitement from Finney's first novel (Time and Again), which so captivated and influenced me to write."
3,"Something Missing This ""Time""..","I Loved the first book,It really made me feel like I was THERE;Finney's descriptions were vivid and entertaining and I learned a lot of things about day- to-day life 1880's NY. The sequel was just OK, the parrallel events theory was intriguing,but,as a whole the story seemed liked a lot of ideas that never followed through. The ending itself was a BIG disappointment,after setting up this potentially great plotline, (Stopping WW1) the author just cheats us by not even following through with that storyline. I did like some of the descriptions of 1912 New York, but they just were'nt as wonderfully descriptive the first novel. Also,the fact that he sort of cheated on his wife bugged me,because he seemed to have no real guilt about it,until the last few chapters of the book. In Conclusion,amusing,but no classic."
3,Huge Inconsistancy,"Apart from all the other logical flaws, hasn't anyone noticed that although Si meets ""Z"" initially in 1912 when he boards the Titanic in 1911 Archie recognizes him (and isn't too thrilled to see him because of their prior interactions). I can't believe Finney or the editor didn't notice.This book could have been so much better; what a shame."
1,Deadly Dull,"If you have read Time And Again, you will be extremely disappointed with this sequel. In the first book, Si Morley traveled into the past and there were long passages describing a long gone New York City that were well written and absorbing. Jack Finney tries to duplicate that by again sending Si back and all it comes off as is long winded and boring: an excruciatingly boring buildup just so Finney can introduce Al Jolson; page upon page of boring descriptions of vaudeville, clothing, architecture and early flight are other examples. If I did not know better, I would say that the kernel of this book (returning to the past to prevent WW I) was originally lopped off Time And Again in order to shorten that book and Jack Finney decided to expand it into full book length just to make a fast buck. He would have been better off re-issuing an expanded, ""uncut"" Time And Again rather than putting out this drivel."
2,A Big Disapointment,"A disapointing sequel to Jack Finney's wonderful ""Time and Again"", written just before his death. The sequel, which could have answered several questions and expanded upon his first work, flops. I almost didn't want to finish it."
3,Disappointing,"I read ""Time and Time Again"" twice, and enjoyed it even better the second time around.""From Time to Time"" does not have the same impact, and just didn't hold my interest. I didn't finish the book."
3,Great book unless you suffer from insomnia!,"This is a big, big book full of information about sleep and sleep disorders. If you are researching sleep disorders, or just want to know a more about sleep and the general issue of sleep disorders and the effect that these problems can have on quality of life, this would be an excellent choice.However, if you are (like I was) looking for a book to help you sleep better, then this is probably not the book for you. I learned nothing new about how to actually help me sleep better. I don't have sleep apnoea, or any of the more unusual sleep disorders - I just wanted to be able to get over my insomnia. It is a massive book about sleep, and how important it is. But if you have a real sleep problem and you want to cure your insomnia, you'd be better off with The Effortless Sleep Method or Say Goodnight to Insomnia because of all the insomnia books, I found these two the most helpful."
5,What do you know about sleep?,"After reading The Promise of Sleep I realized that I previously did not know anything about sleep. Since everyone sleeps, everyone should know what good sleep can do for you and what lack of sleep can do to you. Most people seem to be misinformed about sleep. This book will teach you what you need to know about sleep.It is in four parts; 1. The Fundamentals of Sleep 2. When Sleep Fails 3. When Sleep Works 4. The Principles of Healthy SleepAt 542 pages it can get boring in some of the chapters dealing with sleep disorders.After reading The Promise of Sleep I have changed the way I sleep and I think you would too."
1,"Pedantic, packed with trivial anecdotal time wasting stories","I am a Geriactric Nurse Practitioner, Teach graduate courses, read extensively and hated this book. If the author could refrain from ""Then I set up the worlds first..."" and if the information could be separated from the self-promoting biographical stories, it might be useful. However you are so tired of listening to him blathering that you fall asleep; Perhaps the intention of the book!! Buy a briefer more useful book instead."
2,dilute content,"I'm your run-of-the-mill insomniac, and thought I would get a few tips about how to get some better sleep from this very thick book. There were a few interesting topics discussed, but I don't feel like it did anything to help me gain an understanding of how I could sleep better. Most of the discussion was on normal sleep or disorders such as sleep apnea. The actual informational content of this book could fit into about a quarter of the pages, but the good doctor is EXTREMELY repetitive."
2,Good info. but a painful read,"I find myself weeding through the book trying to pick out the actual informative content regarding sleep because so much of the content is autobiographical and self-laudatory -- not so much about sleep but about the good doctor himself; and even when he is discussing sleep, he never fails to point out how he and no other discovered this or that. If the doctor simply stuck with the subject at hand -- sleep, I would have given more stars. Rather, I feel as if I am reading the CV of an egomaniac."
1,"This book will really promise you sleep - so boring, useless","I bought this book simply by other readers' good reviews, and I felt disgusted, cheated, and angry after I read 3/4 of the book, and then I threw this book out. This book is so packed with dumb, useless information that there is nothing you can learn. Before you get anything, you will fall asleep. I am not sure whether I should ask for a refund, since it really kept the promise of sleep. THIS BOOK MADE ME SLEEP ! (even though I was eager to learn something about ""sleep"", and I was not sleepy at all). I don't know other reviewers, what kind of people are they ? How come they can give this book five stars ?"
1,One of the worst I have read,"If you read this self agradnizing, self promoting, tedious, endless, uninformative piece of trash, you are dumber than I am!! You wade through the ""why I am a hero"" garbage hoping to get to ANY useful info., but you will not find it. FORGET IT!!!"
3,Good for beginners. Not enough advanced information.,"Based on the length of the book and Dr. Dement's billing as a leading researcher, I expected more in-depth information. This is easy reading and I enjoyed much of it, however I had to read hundreds of pages to get only a little new information."
3,Preaches to the Choir,"Clearly passionate about his research, accomplishments and importance, the author repeatedly laments the lack of priority and funding for sleep research. Constant lament number two is the unenlightened perception of the medical community with regard to sleep. Not a very hopeful treatment of the subject. Frustrates the reader to invest so much time, on so many pages, for so little return. Comprehensive list of sleep centers might be very helpful for thoses seeking medical treatment."
2,This book will put you to sleep,The author spends too much time telling us his life story and not enough solid information about sleep. Dated.
2,Losing his touch,"Dead Hand is an example of what happens when a good author runs out of ideas.The plot is appealing enough - we Americans LOVE renegade Russian generals - but even that may be starting to wear a little thin. Unfortunately the characters need lots more work, the story line seems to be jumbled collection of disconnected scenarios, and the small unit combat actions - the passages which Harold Coyle has always been so good at - are pretty much absent from the book.Mr. Coyle's musings on the nature of military leadership are borrowed from Ted Fehrenbach's study of Korea, ""This Kind of War"" and the description of the meteor strike reminds me a little too much of Niven and Pournelle's ""Lucifer's Hammer"".Dead Hand leaves me with the feeling that the book was written in a great rush to meet a contract date. It also leaves me feeling that a good writer has become burnt out."
2,A Disappointment,"I have read all of Harold Coyle novels todate and eagerly looked forward to his latest. Unfortunately , this one is not up to his usual high marks. His characters lack depth and it is almost as if he had tried to put too many into too small a book. It reads more like an outline than a novel.French Foreign Legion, SAS, Special Forces, Russian Commandos,Falling Comets, Political Upheaval, all too much for such a short book.Coyle should go back to writing about what he knows best,"" Soldiering!""Anyone of the characters that he describes , so briefly, would have made a great story. I do hope his next is back up to par with his earlier novels."
2,Sadly Disappointing,"Having read Coyle for many years and been amazed at his ability to transfer the feeling of men in combat, I was disappointed by this offering. It reads like a B Movie or an Episode of the old ""Combat"" TV show. Nothing is new, everything is old hat, you can just about write the story as you read along. The tough Scotsman, the soldier with the misunderstanding wife, the soldier torn between duty and his mentor. Way under the level that I would expect from Coyle.It seems as if Mr. Coyle had to deliver a book, any book, to his publishers, but he delivered a novella. If you reduce the type font and take out the myriad blank pages, the stories maybe 200 pages, and not very compelling. At no time did there seem to be any suspense or real danger that the ""ultimate"" would happen. If he's just going to go through the motions, he should at least put a warning in the preface.The title says it all in more ways than Coyle planned."
1,Not the Harold Coyle I Am Used To,"I have greatly enjoyed most of Coyle's books in the past, so I expected more of the same in this book. How wrong I was. The plot concept is ripe for quality action and writing, but Coyle instead spends more time waxing poetic about the philosophies of command and the ethos of combat. Of the 298 pages in the book, maybe 8 are vintage Coyle; the rest are drawn out editorials and dull character descriptions. There is next to no character development whatsoever; aside from their respective nationalities, each of the main characters is indistinguishable for the other. I honestly struggled to find the will to finish this book, and I agree with other reviewers that it appears that Coyle was either on a deadline or his new publishing house has an axe to grind."
2,Not among Coyle's best - 2 1/2 stars,"Although my thoughts are not as negative as many of the reviews listed here, Dead Hand is clearly not among Coyle's best works. The action and frequent battle scenes that typically fill Coyle's works were largely absent here. Instead, Coyle takes the reader on a journey of preparation that leads to the action at the end. During the build-up, Coyle goes on at length about the duty, honor, courage and valor of the soldier, regardless of rank or nation of origin. While this is clearly a noble position to take, the presentation of this theme seems to overwhelm."
1,Disappointing in many ways,"I agree with the other reviewers who have labled this book a sad effort from a stellar writer of military fiction. The premise of the story, that Russia would allow a NATO force to invade its own territory to solve an internal dispute, is almost laughable. Never mind that all of this takes place during one of the worst natural disasters in centuries, where the Russian government would probably be doing its best just to keep up with relief efforts.Probably more troubling, though, is the complete lack of editing or proofreading. My copy of the book contains nearly one hundred basic spelling and grammatical errors (i.e. ""loosing"" instead of ""losing""). The only reason this gets even one star is that I like Coyle's early works. Get this from the library, but don't pay money for it."
1,Dismal,"Absolutely dismal. Harold Coyle used to write the best soldiering books. But Dead Hand simply [stinks]. The first (and only) firefight does not take place until page 300 something with the book, mercifully, near it's end. Even the editing [stinks], with spelling errors rampant throughout the book. (They're called ""needle nose pliers"" . . . not ""needle nose plies"".How sad that Harold Coyle has sunk to this level."
4,INTERESTING PREMISE,"AS USUAL, COYLE COMES THROUGH. GOOD PREMISE AND USUALLY FAST PACED. AN INTERESTING READ."
1,Dead Hand,"NOTE TO FUTURE REVIEWERS: There are no excuses for giving this book more than one star. Save yourself some time; dont' read the book, but log on and give it one star."
5,Strong Offences Make Better Neighbors,"""Dear Neighbor"" is a delight for anyone who has ever sent ""just a little reminder"" to anyone about anything. We can all identify with not wanting to step on anyone's toes. As a situation escalates, you wind up wanting to feed those same toes into a tree shredder. Read this book and satisfy those desires."
5,Perfect multi-purpose label,"These clear labels are perfect for any use. I have used them for Christmas labels, but they work well in any application. I like them because the label itself is not the focus of attention, but rather what is printed on the label. The clear label makes a cleaner, more customized look for the return address...as though I sent the envelopes out to a professional printer."
3,Avery Easy Peel Clear Address Labels,"These are pretty basic adress labels.They are quite thin, matte finish and transparent material, much like the usual tape for wrapping holiday gifts.I have no problem with them, but the price is a little high for labels of such average quality. It isn't a product I'd buy again.I don't think the cost is worth the product and is not something I'd recommend. I'm also miffed as why we can't manufacture such simple paper products here in the US."
2,Ink Smudges!,"Not sure what the issue was but each time I printed a sheet of labels for my baby shower invites, the ink smeared! I have a new 3-in-1 HP printer and the ink would not dry to the labels. Other than that I love the clear look and they are very easy to peel off and they make the envelopes look neat and crisp. If anyone has any suggestions on what I may have done wrong...please let me know! I tried different settings and nothing worked!"
4,"Good, but some template issues.","The following is my fiancée's review of the labels.My fiancé and I used these labels for our Save the Date postcards for our wedding. We put all of the addresses in Excel and we were able to easily transfer it to Word for the template for the labels. It was fairly easy to figure out the template for the labels. When they printed out, they looked really good. There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center. I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer. I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay. About three out of 100 labels were messed up. I recommend these labels. I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates. When I put them on the postcards, they looked really good =)"
4,Clearly Nearly,"I wanted these labels for an alternate use. I am getting married in October, and I thought rather than just tying a ribbon around them, I would make personalized labels for them. I figured address labels would be a good size, and when I saw the clear ones, I thought they look better than the solid white ones.I thought wrong. These did not work for my purpose AT ALL. The clear showed air pockets on the bubble containers, and (even after letting the labels dry overnight) when I tried to smooth them out, there was some smudging. Even the slightest bit of moisture smears the labels, which isn't really a good idea for something that is going to hold bubbles. (See my customer images.)However, much like that guy my Grandmother set me up with when I was in college, this stuff is great on paper. I guess I can't fault it for not working on an item that is not its intended use.Luckily, I also ordered theAvery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Inch Clear Address Labels, and those worked perfectly."
3,"Not ""clear""","If you are looking for clear, glossy labels, these are not them. These have a ""frosted"" finish and will appear matte on whatever you are applying them on. I was looking for clear labels to apply to glossy business cards, and these won't work. Easy enough to format and peel off, but don't meet my needs."
5,"Extremely easy to create labels, peels well, sticks well... what else can I say?","Writing my address for bills has been such pain in the butt however this product made all that so much easier. I prints well, does not jam as it advertises and sticks well on the envelops. What more can you ask for address labels?"
5,Love that they are clear,I like that fact that these are clear. When putting on a colored envelope they look super.
4,"Good labels, work fine in my HP Inkjet","I received these labels and the first thing I did was print out a page of address labels with my own information on them to test the quality. The printer was able to feed the label paper through the printer with no issues. Printing in economy wasn't the best idea as it was faint. I reprinted the labels using standard ink quality and everything came out perfect. Text was centered on the labels as it should be, no jams, no label's peeling off in the printer. These work well.I actually used another version of this label a few years back on my wedding invitations to create custom return address labels and saved a ton of money over ordering custom labels from some company. These labels match the quality and I could easily recommend using these for anything from mailing bills to mailing wedding invitations, they do a great job and the quality of the label is really good."
5,Avery Clear Address Labels,"These labels are perfect for any or multi-colored designs you want for identification, addressing or application add-ons.Easy to use, just great and clear backing is good for any solid color page application. They are my favorite for multipurpose uses."
5,Unusually Useful Labels,"These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects, particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. You can affix them to a bare wood surface, making sure to burnish the labelssecurely, then apply clear finish on top. I've found that they work very well for (of allthings) custom guitar work. It's relatively easy to create your own headstock logo design,and a few coats of clear finish will make them look almost as good as a decal. I have hadno problems with the ink reacting negatively with lacquer or poly finishes. The main pointis that you do not want to burnish the labels directly, as the ink will rub off. Acetateor some similar material should be placed on top before burnishing. I used a graphic artstype burnisher tool, but you could improvise to see what works best for you. Of course,this is only one idea, but the versatility of these Avery labels makes them a good buy."
5,Briefly,"These panties are top quality and fit me perfectly. Hopefully, they will last a long time as all other Vanity Fair products I've purchased. Good Deal!!!"
4,lots of great content though a bit hard to read,"This book was very helpful to me because it gave me real code and showed the SUN BDK beanbox tool being used to link JavaBeans. I thank the author for a generally accurate and error free book. Though not perfect, it is better than many Java and JavaBeans books.One thing I found somewhat irritating was that the makefile contents for the JAR utility were reproduced for each and every program. Soon I just skipped all of those; they wasted paper and room.Another irritant is that the author didn't show how to just use jar to wrap up the beans. You don't HAVE to use nmake. I was able to get along without it.I also found the 2nd person viewpoint writing style to be a little awkward (You do this, etc.) In fact, the style is a bit too wordy and drawn-out. Why can't anyone write a SHORT and terse Java book?!But overall, this was a very useful book and I'm glad I read it."
5,A Cherished Friend,"If you love horses, you'll love this look. I cannot say enough about the wonderful paintings. Richard Stone Reeves is simply without equal. His paintings have intricate detail, and mirror the personality of each subject. In addition, the text is exceptionally well written. Each painting is accompanied by a history of the horse. Also included is Mr. Reeves' bio. My copy will never be for sale"
1,Doggy Hoots Dog Toy Rings Original Chuck-A-Duck,My Puppy Lab did chew this toy apart with in 15 minutes. But she had fun going it. So one star for this product.
3,"Nice, but I'm glad I got it on a Goldbox Deal!","I hardly think it's worth the suggested list of $70 or even the $45 Amazon price. I paid substantially less for it while it was a Goldbox Deal. The packaging was a small ziplock bag NOT the blue velvet advertised. The labeling on the packaging says 'large double heart polished rhodium 18"".' While it's fairly common to flash coat rhodium onto silver to prevent tarnishing, the product description does not mention this fact about the necklace."
4,Nice for the Price,"Bought for a Valentines Present. The silver finish is very good, The chain is a bit light."
2,Elric Saga continues to disappoint,"After being totally disappointed with part 1, I was hoping the saga would start to come togther in part 2. But Elric's character continues to be shallow and the adventures continue to be predictable and unlikely even when applying the rules of sword and sorcery. Moorcock totally abandons any attempt to set any semblance of laws for Elric's world. It's like reading a vampire story where vampires can travel in daylight. I suspect Moorcock wrote this during a decline in his writing ability as there is no less than at least 1 application of the word SARDONIC each and every page."
5,Mo'friggin'neen,"Just buy it, the only three words that I can say. Been listening to these guys for over 3 years and only for one reason! THEY ROCK! Kenny,Hippy,Peter and Eric equals a hailstorm of energy. If this record doesn't do it for you, go see them live. Then it will."
5,Moneen rocks!,"This CD is incredible, but their live performance is much better. I would definately suggest checking them out on tour, either with Brand New right now or with Reggie in August and September. They rock and they are great guys too. Rock on Moneen."
5,Great! A cheap and reliable iPod Touch,"The touch screen is great, and, while I don't use the stylus, it's nice to know I have it (I haven't taken the plastic off of the screen yet, but once I do, I know I'll smudge it without that stylus.) The USB charger is great, although I haven't had to charge it yet in the first week. The 4 gigs of space isn't as much as I'd hoped, but I plan to purchase a few SD cards to make up for it (which it supports). Definitely worth it's price. No problems with it at all, except there's no way to store the stylus on the device. I've knotted mine to the headphone wire, which isn't desirable."
5,Cowon D2,"I am very pleased with the Cowon D2. I spent a lot of time researching MP3 players and have not been disappointed with my choice. Thus far, I have only used it to listen to audio books from Overdrive, and podcasts. It is great for both. Another plus is the terrific battery life. My son, an audio engineer, has used it to listen to music and is very impressed with the sound quality. Overall it is a great product."
4,Cowon D2,"This is really a great product. In my opinion the only reason it has not captured the market is because of the lack in marketing and does not have the traits of ""great customer service"".The quality of the sound is excellent and has plenty of audio features like a 5 band equalizer, surround sound, BBE and other bass enhancers. The video quality is great too. Supports almost all kinds of music formats. The JPEG viewer takes a second to display a focused picture but eventually displays very good clarity. The touch screen is awesome and fairly easy to use once accustomed. The voice recorder works really great. Awesome quality and great mic. Have not tried the in-line recording as yet. My only dissapointment was the FM reception in doors. The FM receiver definetly lacks. But over all a great product and would recommend it."
1,Touch screen - Top menu line no longer works after less than 1 month!,"At first I loved this player.But, after less than a month, the top line of the menu won't respond (bottom line of menu works fine). Pressing reset does not help.This did not happen after any kind of trauma. I put the player (while turned on) into my pocket while I was carrying things in from the car. It never worked right after that short pocket trip. Weird."
2,A travesty,"I first took it out of the box and turned it on and the screen lit up with the company greeting. Then it went black and never turned on again.Returned it for an exchange.Received another unit and it faired better- for about a day. Then it too died on me. Sent it back for refund with a terse comment on the product.Forget this, you can do a lot better."
3,Not Recommended for Macintosh,"I don't recommend the Cowon D2 for use with a Macintosh computer. I purchased the D2 as a Christmas gift for my wife so while gardening she could listen to PBS FM radio, an audio book or music. I chose the Cowon because there are no ipods with built-in FM tuners and it is listed as being compatible with a Mac. I had no trouble getting files in, but not in an organized fashion. The problem is that the supplied software is not compatible with a Mac. Even though I put the files in folders before transfer, they all ended up going in as one batch of individual files. I downloaded detailed instructions from the Cowon website but the instructions didn't help. This makes it very difficult to access a particular CD, artist or audiobook."
4,Cowon D2 4GB Portable Media Player,"The player is great. Probably one of the best I have used. I am having just two small issues. I can't seem to put my music into any kinds of categories and have it work. Also, can't figure out what is the best format for songs I load onto the player. Like mp3, or wav, or wma, etc. Other then that it works really well for me.Cowon D2 4GB Portable Media Player (Black)"
1,Dies after taking out in chicago cold weather in a jacket !!!!,"This was a ok product while it lasted , updated the software , was listening to it in outside weather . plugged in to computer and i see multicolored screen . the player is not recognized by computer , returned back .wish list for my MP3 playerWIFIexpandable memorytouchscreenDIVX compatiable ( player should rezize any size and play it"
3,"Not up to it, well perhaps not that bad","I bought this to replace a hard drive device which died when dropped. Unfortunately the levels of memory offered with flash devices is simply useless. What kills the D2 for me though is the software. Worked fine till I upgraded the firmware. Now the device doesn't support flac! The Jetshell software which ships with the product no longer recognises the existence of the device though the computer sees it. Can't upgrade the Jetshell software unless I get on plane to go home and dig out the serial number of the old installation. To sum up Cowon products are just not worth the trouble.Update.To be fair after five years I still have this device plugged in to a spare amplifier and use it for background noise, a job which it does perfectly adequately."
2,"Good user experiance, Average Ear phones, Video out cable not Included, Dosen't play DivX, XVid Movies","Received this on time, so seller is good but the overall product is not up to markI thought to be good replacement for I-Pod or any other MP3/Video Player. But its not. Earphones supplied with it are very average, dosen't have builtin speakers, Video out cable sould seperatly so no TV out, Dosen't play DivX, XVid movies so u need to convert them before u can watch them. Its primarly a Audio product and not multimedia player."
5,Wonderful!,"What no one seems to mention about this little beauty is the txt reader. With ABClit converter I converted most of my ebook library over and transfered it over onto my D2 with no problem. The text reader is convenient and easy to use - I've already read two full-length books on it, and I've only had my D2 for a few days. The screen is large enough to actually be able to watched subbed anime on, and this is surprising for me, because I don't have the best eyesight in the first place.Transferring files over is easy and the design is simple and easy to use. This is a great PMP for the more tech-inclined who don't want to spend a lot of money."
2,An in depth look into a cult,"I read this book and was constantly wondering if what I was reading was factual.Between the way the government continually and immediately reacts to the Falun Gong, and the way Li Hongzhi proclaims to be a deity, this was all just too hard to swallow.Li is delusional and the people following him are paying with their lives while he safely lives in the USA. Pathetic. A deity shouldn't have to hide in another country.Similar to Christian Scientists, Li has the Falun Gong believe they don't need medical treatment for their ailments and that he will protect his followers.Conversely, the Chinese government clearly staged some of the prosecutions of Falun Gong members on youtube.This is just a fairy tale. Both sides aren't telling the truth."
1,A book with very flawed Sources,"I don't want to say too much about this publication other then that it has very flawed sources. Many of the quotations and facts the author states about the practice of Falun Dafa are taken from Chinese Communist Party propaganda Articles.When a publication is using seriously flawed and false sources, I personally see no value in it. It basically becomes a book of false information which is of no use to anyone except maybe the Chinese Communist Party who have been using propaganda to persecute people for the past 55 years.I cannot recommend this book at all. If you want a proper commentary on the situation of Falun Gong and the History of the Chinese Communist Party I highly recommend you Read ""The 9 Commentaries on Communist Party""In fact if you really want a clear picture on the situation in China and on major issues like the persecution of Falun Gong, the Epoch Times is a very worthy News source and currently the most respected source on China news available today."
5,One of my Fave Bands,"Arrived in the condition described. Plays well. Didn't expect it to come from overseas...and on time. This is a hard to find CD. I had their LP, but wanted the CD. Thank you!"
4,"Practical, useful ideas with exercises and drills to follow","I found this tape set to be very useful in my telephone sales and customer service skills training sessions. Have purchased a dozen or more sets for use by my clients. Dr. Fleming not only demonstrates what to do to improve the sound of your voice, but gives drills and exercises for doing it. Do the recordings of your own speech patterns and follow her instructions. Before long, you'll hear noticeable changes in your voice."
3,Vocal review,"I really like the set of CD's and the exercises. However I am giving this three stars because it is so hard to return to the CD's to find the specific exercises I need to work on. For example: I'll record my voice, do the exercises as instructed, go back to the CD for specific coaching and I have to listen through lecture and examples again before I can get back to the part I need to review.My mind tends to wander as the author covers examples that aren't relevant to my situation, then she'll quickly hit on a topic that I do need help with but I completely miss it because I was daydreaming. Then I kick myself repeatedly because I have to relisten to all the irrelevant examples in order to get back to the helpful section.I would give this set 5 stars if it was searchable software that allowed me to quickly skip to the section of interest."
3,Odd,"The tapes give good information, but the main speaker sounds as though she has a lisp, and I didn't find her tone of voice to be pleasant but rather odd sounding. However, everyone else featured in the tapes sound normal. I normally wouldn't comment on such a matter, but given the subject, it doesn't seem appropriate to me, and had I known this, I would not have been interested in this tape."
5,NOT a lisp,"I won't cover other aspects of the product, which are covered already by other reviewers.Just fyi, it's not a lisp, it's a ""de-esser"" used on the recording: an analog audio compressor used to decrease sibilance (i.e., hissing from pronunciation of ""s"") in recordings where vocals are up-front. They have the threshold set a little low. (Google ""de-esser"".)"
4,How will this help you?...,Does sound corny but also goes through some useful territory in the later sections.It's not ALL stellar but if you are experimental you will find some good in this program.
4,"Essential Steps to Projecting Yourself as a Confident, Engaging Man.","Standing tall, walking slow, improving your vocal communication - These are all essential steps to projecting yourself well.This book addresses that last issue, in great detail. Think of the most confident men in your social circles - all have natural or well developed vocal skills. Talking slow, deliberate, focused, with tonal variety. This book will help you unlock those secrets.- GiddyupGuy"
1,Sagebrush Sleuth,Did not receive. The book and been sold and I am to receive a credit on my charge card.
3,"If your English is not good enough, you need it!","TOEFL consists of four sections: listening, grammar, reading and writing. This book gives you detailed review of all those sections. If your English level is about 450 to 540 points (paper based), this book will boost your score.However, if you already got 550 points or more, this book seems not suitable to you because the practices seem a little easier than the real CBT test.The most important thing is most practices are paper based type questions not CBT type."
1,Way too much money to efile!!!,"Buyer Beware!!!Well it looks like Turbo Tax got greedy this year. Filing my taxes previously using efile cost nothing ($14.95 with a $14.95 rebate) but all that has changed. Now Turbo Tax wants $14.95 to efile (no rebate mentioned) and in addition a ""processing fee"" of $29.95. So that's an effective price increase of $45 this year to do my taxes. Wow.I'll be printing out my taxes an snail mailing them in. A huge step backwards since I've efiled for the past five years. I've heard some good things about Tax Cut and will be trying it out next year. Bye bye Turbo Tax...The program itself is pretty reliable although has become increasingly bloated with spam (upgrades and offers to get gift cards etc.) from previous years. The exorbitant fees to efile is a deal killer for me and I assume most others. Either go with Tax Cut or take the money and go to a real tax professional - you'll be better off!"
4,Almost as good as last year's version,"I've used this software for several years-I didn't feel it was quite as good as last year. The interview did not seem as extensive as before. I do like the fact that it transfers some information from the previous year (if still in your hard drive.). However, It still is much better than another competetive program."
2,Is there anything better?,"I have used Turbo Tax for years and this does seem like the worst year. It takes away choice in many ways. It is hard to elect other methods than the what the program thinks is the best unless you cheat the numbers. Security transactions are difficult. Finding your way back to a specific point to check it is difficult.Printing - you either don't print, or print pages and pages whether you need them or not. Nor does it offer options to print even and odd pages. In fact there are no page setup options.I don't like Turbo tax, but I'm afraid to switch - is anything else better, and by staying with this one, it imports info from last year.If you have Quicken, it imports data, but that doesn't always work real well."
4,TurboTax,I have used this product in the past. It works quite well and is easy enough for most anyone to use.
3,Mike Corbett & Jay Hirsh with Hugh McCracken,"May be a little late coming to THIS party but wanted to comment on George's 2002 review. The Mr. Flood's Party IS a fine album and I am sure anyone who has heard it is waiting for a cd reissue. There was a follow-up, of sorts, in 1972 when Mike Corbett and Jay Hirsh released a self-titled album on Atco along with master guitar player Hugh McCracken (Mike Corbett & Jay Hirsh with Hugh McCracken). Some terrific music that also fell between the cracks. McCracken really brings the songs alive. It was released on lp and to this day has not been issued on cd and doubtful it ever will be. Go, seek out the vinyl!"
5,Another stunning collection of counterfactuals,"If you've ever thought history was even slightly boring, try thinking of the myriad alternative human universes that could have been born -- indeed, that had to be avoided -- along the way to where we are. If the Armada had not been defeated ... if Lee had won the civil war ... the possibilites are endless, and if you don't experience little shudders of horror or nostalgic loss when listening to this collection, you haven't been listening hard enough."
3,Not quite what was expected..,I ordered these bulbs assuming they were stage 1 because it didn't say on the ad which stage they were. Turns out they were stage 2 which means you usually need an upgraded wiring harness to avoid melting the stock one. Definatly look up the model number before ordering so you don't make the same mistake i did. Plus the picture shown isn't actually what you get.
2,Aladdin by Justina,"I like this book because Aladdin starts off not rich but finds a genie and his whole life changes. He meets a princess, he likes her, and towards the end he gets to be a prince. Never stop believing."
3,Good condition I think,I never cooked alligator so I can't tell if it's really in good condition or not. Should have found a recipe.
4,dangerous liasons,I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK. ALTHOUGH I FELT THAT ZILIA WAS A PITYFUL GIRL WHOM NEEDED TO TAKE CONTROL OVER HER SITUATION BUT SHE WAS A GOOD CHARACTER. I THINK SHE HAD A GREAT LIFE IN THE END. THE BOOK IS A QUICK READ AND ENJOYABLE. GREAT TO READ WHILE WATCHING THE MOVIE CRUEL INTENTIONS 1999. HOPE YOU LIKE IT TOO.
5,A Happy Camper!,"I already reviewed this once before. It arrived in amazing condition considering it dates from 1962. Page edges white, dust jacket in superb condition, etc. My mother went to school with the author and they have remained friends ever since. I will be looking for other books by Joan Liffring."
3,"Not bad, but not great","The other reviews break it down better, but the matches are hit and miss. The commentary is horrible, and picture quality is not the best either. That being said, this is one of the better FMW DVDs out there. There are better ones for sure."
5,The Trees of Yosemite,"Received the book sooner than anticipated, which was a nice surprise. The book was in good condition. It is a gift for my sister and I think she will be pleased! I know I am! Thank you."
2,Very Dry Reading,"Would not recommend this textbook for B2B courses. Theories are poorly explained and examples are poorly written, instead of mixing the examples together each example should be written separately."
2,Great Iron; When it Worked; Out of Warranty,"The iron was great for approximately the warranty period. Ok, to be fair we did get a couple of months past warranty. Now it will not work and Customer Service says oh sorry no longer under warranty. So..., you think I will ask what do you think the cost of repair will be for an auto off function that is continuously engaged and they tell you we don't know you will need to contact the closest service center. The service center tells you by recording, over and over, how your call is important and that they are open conveniently enough at the time you are calling, but apparently being open doesn't include answering the telephone. What a let down. I am glad this is not a company that I own. If you purchase, I wish you better luck than I had with this product."
2,water leak,We owned a Rowenta for almost 1.5 years then the heater that produces steam burned up and the iron quit working. We liked the Rowenta so we bought this iron. On the second day this iron started leaking water all over the place. The water was coming out of the cord retraction area. Poor craftsmanship or I got a lemon.
1,cord reel system poor~ very noisy,Irons okay~ needs good pressure to get wrinkles out. Cord reel system is noisy and squeeky. Cord reel feature does not always reel in cord with out help!! Whats up with Irons lately??? Having a very hard time finding a good quality Iron.
1,"Great iron, if it only worked correctly","This iron was a great product, even though I already had to replace the one I bought in December with this newer one. Now this one is doing the exact same thing - the auto-shut off button engages. Even though the iron is not sitting more than 15-20 seconds, just long enough to adjust the shirt or other item on the ironing board to continue ironing. We lose heat. We unplug it, it heats up again and shuts off promptly with the red light flashing. Unfortunately, I am going to buy a Black and Decker, GE, or whatever gives me longer than 3 months of service. I tried."
1,DX1900 - Expensive for a paperweight!!!,"Rowenta is known for its quality and durability but they failed on this model DX1900. It was so great in the 1st few weeks till it lasted when the auto-off feature became faulty as it keeps turning off EVEN while ironing. I had to unplug/plug after 5 seconds to get turn it back on and by the time you're ready to iron, it turns off again. After multiple repetition of doing the same painful process, you realized that you're already running late & not even ready to leave.Warning! It does not really matter how much you pay for an iron for as long as it works but this one just became an expensive paperweight...A BIG WASTE OF MONEY & TIME!"
1,Poor Quality,I bought this iron because I have always had Rowenta's and I thought it would be nice to have a retractable cord. The cord is nice but the iron STOPPED heating up after 2 months. The auto shut-off keeps coming on every few seconds and I have to unplug and plug in again. Very annoying when you are trying to get things done. I will NEVER buy another iron from Rowenta because they do not back there products.
1,Rowenta DX1900 Effective Cord Reel Iron,"I received this iron two years ago as a gift. I didn't use it until the warranty was about up nor did I register it so there is nothing I can do and I cannot blame Rowenta for my ball drop. But a bad product is a bad product. The cord never properly reeled in - so I would manually push it in which probably is the reason it now will blow a fuse if I turn it on as it is internally leaking water. This product was never tested properly and in my opinion is extremely dangerous. I have taken my iron, put it back into the brand new box it came in and have thrown it in the garbage."
1,Do Not buy,Worst iron ever. I wish I had read the reviews here first. The iron has never worked. The auto shut off never goes off so the iron never heats. Avoid this brand at all cost.
2,Was nice the first time,The handle is a bit tight and on the second use the cord retract broke. Other than that it has irons well. I'll stick with Panasonic which worked flawlessly for over eight years (along with the cord retract).
1,Cord did not reel in!,"The ironing performance was typically Rowenta, not bad, but the cord reel broke after a short time and the water leaked from the iron. Very disappointing."
2,Rowenta Irons - don't last/ poor customer service,"I am on my second Rowenta Iron. This one stopped working after 5 months. The light does not go on and the sole plate does not heat up. The company will not replace the iron. I have to ship it to them and the whole process can take six weeks, so I have to buy another iron in the meantime. Irons should last longer that five months and if they are broken they should issue immediate credit for a new iron and not make you wait. Mine was made in China as well. Had to stop using the other iron becuase it spurted black and then the sole plate would not stay on/not. had to keep jiggling it."
1,Fine until a month after warranty expired,"Like many others who gave this product a low rating, I was satisfied for the first year. Simply put, it did what it was supposed to do.Just a few months ago the auto-off function would constantly kick in for no reason. It got to the point where I couldn't use it anymore because 30 seconds after warming up, it would shut down. Plus, the retractable cord stopped working right around the same time.I called customer service who politely informed me if it was within the 1 year warranty, they'd replace it, but, as it's not, I'd have to pay to get it fixed. I purchased it about 14 months ago, so no free replacement here.Ultimately, the problem is the product appears to be cheaply manufactured, which leads to an incredibly short lifespan. Rowenta has lost a customer and gained an advocate of choosing competing brands."
3,outstanding when all the buttons work,"This is my 3rd Rowenta Cord Reel Iron, unfortunately, this one has a sticky steam button, I hope it will loosen up over time. Otherwise, Rowenta vertical steam irons are the best in the business."
2,Poor Quality,"It's great, if it works!!! After keep exchanging it over and over, I gave up the 5th time. First time, spray didn't work, second time, power steam button didn't release the steam, third time, it was too strong fabric got stock underneath the iron and I couldn't clean the iron, fourth time, steam problem again, fifth time, steam problem again. Poorly tested product. I would've been really happy to keep it, if it was working properly. It actually had all the features I was looking for. Too bad for Rowenta for not testing their products properly."
3,Reliability?,"This iron is great... when it works. I loved mine but it broke within two weeks. It stopped heating up at all. I was extremely disappointed since I thought I was buying a high-quality iron. Rowenta did replace the iron at no cost; however, it took three weeks which is a long time to be without an iron. I really hope my new one keeps working because it is a great iron that heats up fast and makes ALOT of steam."
2,Works good but not reliable,"The iron works well and has nice features, especially the retracting cord and the no drip water feature. Unfortunatley the overall quality is lacking. We have had this a little over a year and it has quit functioning. It appears that the safety auto off function is broken and shuts the iron off before it even heats up. It is now useless. This is the first Rowenta iron we have had and it will be the last. The irons are pricey and not any better than the Black and Decker, Sunbeams, etc. especially if you look at the high price of the Rowenta's."
1,Don't Buy This Iron,Owned it for slightly more than a year before it started leaking water via the handle. Water and electricity din't mix. Clearly a defective product.
1,Piece of Junk!,Worked great until the 60 return policy ran out. Now the auto-off switch won't keep the iron on. I can keep the iron hot for 2 seconds if I am lucky. Is there a zero stars option???
1,Don't buy it...,I have now owned two of this model. The first would not rewind the cord and both the first and second leak and constantly shut off when you are using them. I had a much higher expectation for an iron in this price point. Spoke to Rowenta and they have no interest in standing behind the product. Learn from my mistakes and spend your money elsewhere.
1,what a disappointment,"Awesome iron for 3 weeks! Spit a little, but I just overlooked. Now it won't stay on, auto-shut off keeps blinking as soon as it heats to temp. Do I want to pay to ship it somewhere to be fixed or replaced? After reading so many poor reviews maybe just cut my loss and buy cheap, since they are all throw-away regardless!"
2,Too hard for young Dora fans,"This game is rather simple in theory but it seems to be very hard to get the characters to do what they are supposed to do. Every time you complete a level, you receive a password that must be written down in order to remember it. Maybe we just had a bum game, but half of the time even we entered the password correctly, it would say that it was unacceptable. This game is rated E for everyone but considering that most Dora fans are ages 3-7, I feel that this game is too advanced for Dora fans. Our four year old couldn't play it. Shoot, even mom and dad had a hard time! I'd say pass on this one!"
1,Harlem Nights Movie Poster,"The poster arrived in good condition inside a tube. We needed a high quality product because we photographed the poster, enlargened the image, and created a mural for the inside of our elevator."
3,dep,"Early spiral bound edition --extremely small print and poor editing makes for a very difficult read. His thesis is intriguing and even if Atwill's assumptions are close to accurate, the ""Roman"" Gospel authors failed to accomplish their purpose."
3,Mick Farren&The Deviants-'Fragments Of Broken Probes' (Captain Trip),"Nifty Japanese import of a sixteen track compilation of the Deviant's rare cuts,out takes and some unreleased material from 1968-92.Maybe not quite as good as the '...Earthlings' comp,(see my review)but it somehow seems more demented.'Fragments...' tend to show vocalist Mick Farren's warped sense of humor.That's a good thing.Tunes I dug the most were ""It's All In The Picture"",the punkish ""Screwed Up"",""Outrageous Contagious"",""Shock Horror"" and the good live recording of ""Half Price Drinks"".""Broken Statue"" is like pure UK rock&roll with an attitude of it's own.Should appeal to fans of The Damned,New York Dolls,Blue Cheer,MC 5 and Pink Fairies."
1,Can't sleep? Problem solved!,"I consider myself to be a huge music devotee. I'm interested in theory, as well as music of all types. Experimental, jazz, noise, classical, indie rock, whatever. I read books on music and the lives of musicians I admire.But wow.This dvd set is beyond dull. I have tried a dozen times to make it all the way through with no avail. I have loaned it out to friends, also musicians. Same thing. It's simply not watchable. I recently sold them at a garage sale for 20 bucks.No questioning Bernstein's genius. That is undeniable. However it's pretty clear here that this is, to put it maybe too simply, mental masturbation.Save your money. Go rent or buy a remastered edition of West Side Story and appreciate the genius firsthand. As your friend, I'm telling you, don't buy this."
3,My Introduction to Wild Turkey,"Of course Wild Turkey consists of bassist Glenn Cornick(of Jethro Tull fame,) Gary Pickford-Hopkins, and Bernie Marsden (before his Whitesnake days.) The only song I heard from them is Butterfly on the unfortunately out of print album ""Battle Hymm"" So when I saw this CD I decided to dig in and I was impressed. Although the sound quality isn't top notch, being a live recording from 73, the music is still top notch. The great bonus is the Traffic Island Jam. Great dual guitar, an awesome bass solo from Glenn, and a cool drum solo from Jeff Jones. All I have to say is the whole Wild Turkey back-catalog NEEDS to be re-issued!"
2,"Small clumps, no substance...","I assumed this product would ""magically erase"" pet hair or at least have the pet hair stick to the pet eraser with few motions, which it did neither. After several (read: too many) strokes against the surface of my furniture, most of the hair still remained. I kept trying to sweep the pet hair up with no real succes. But after those many strokes it did clump up, but not as well as a previous reviewer claimed. I ended up giving up and pulling out my vacuum cleaner instead, which did a much better job in a shorter amount of time."
2,Just use your vacuum,"I do not think that this helps me get my furniture any cleaner than just using my vacuum with an attachment. If you have a lot of pet hair, of course this will help, but it's not going to get it clean down to the upholstery. If you push too hard, the sponge starts to flake off leaving another mess to clean up. I've gone back to just using my vacuum and a sticky lint brush for cleaning up my cat's favorite chair!"
2,Does Not Work !,"I am hoping to use this product for some other chore--like dusting. Perhaps it works with longer hair pets.In the case of my short haired Chihuahua, almost nada!The hair doggedly stays on the sofa, stays on me.I am considering a pet vacuum because doggietape does not work well, either."
2,Pet hair remover,"This product may be good for spotty problems. But, I have a white cat that sheds allot and on my dark colored shirts & jackets the hair is like a magnet. If you get lots of hair on your clothes this product has very little value. But then again nothing works that well on cat hair. Still find 3"" sticky tape (the type yopu close cartons with) is the best. I would say do not waste your money."
5,Magic Pet Hair Remover,"We have two cats. One longer hair, one medium hair. Cats go everywhere. Most ""magic"" things only line the pocketbook of the seller, BUT these actually work and work very well. On chairs and clothes--like a sticky sponge that is not sticky."
4,Great for cat hair,"I have always had cats and dogs and have tried just about everything on the market for getting up cat hair, especially from furniture. This works the best of all I've tried. The only negative is that the sides of the sponge start to crumble after a while leaving residue."
2,Magic pet hair remover,"I liked this product but was not able to use it for very long. unfortunately, it didn't keep it's form and I only had 2 weeks of use."
3,Works on furniture and clothing,"This product works well cleaning pet hair from furniture and clothing. Somewhat more difficult to clean the pet hair from the sponge. Overall, would recommend for pet lovers."
3,cheap and easily broken,"the tabs on the side of each lens can be easily broken, I deem the product cheap and easily broken."
3,Holds wires,"I have this attached to thePanaVise 376 Self-Centering, Extra Wide Opening Head. It works well for holding wires in place while the vise holds the circuit board. Does not clamp to the bars on the 376 that well, slides off a bit too easily. Clamp is not padded, so if it was tighter it would scrape the bars on the 376. It's a bit overpriced at $19, $10-12 would be more fair. Would be better if it was a bit smaller, maybe half the size."
4,Works well but overpriced,"Handy item, easy setup, well constructed.Some wider spaced loops on one end (like, duh) would allow it to more easily accommodate bigger wires such as a standard microphone cable. As is, it's much more of a hassle than it should be to use it for bigger stuff.It is definitely useful, but at $20 it's overpriced. $10 to $12 would be fair for what it actually is. That said, it has found a place on my workbench."
4,Dilbert: the 90's answer to Garfield,I love it-- so what if Dilbert is to the nineties what Garfield was to the eighties? Scott Adams is hilarious and captures those common place ideas that we can all relate to.
5,Best on the Market!,"The ""Living Green"" series of supplements has proven to be better balanced and more absorbable than the traditional tablet supplements. Also, the gel cap reduces additives such as Magnesium Stearate which cause headaches and other side effects."
4,"Good, don't leave in hot places","These are great gel supplements. For awhile I took one a day, sometimes another mid-day if I remembered. The problem was that I couldn't carry the huge bottle around between work and school and everything, it is glass! So I would throw a few in my pencil case but then they would get hot and boom vitamin explosion."
1,"Proposition 65 warning on the label, i would never buy this product","Proposition 65 requires the State to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. This list, which must be updated at least once a year, has grown to include approximately 800 chemicals since it was first published in 1987.The list contains a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic chemicals that are known to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm. These chemicals include additives or ingredients in pesticides, common household products, food, drugs, dyes, or solvents. Listed chemicals may also be used in manufacturing and construction, or they may be byproducts of chemical processes, such as motor vehicle exhaust.Gross!"
1,WARNING: (State of CA Prop 65) This product contains a chemical known to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm.,Take at your own risk. You can find this information by searching other websites that list the ingredients and warning label. I would not want a pregnant woman unknowingly take multivitamins that contain this warning.
5,Let's Go PSYCHO!,"Not only does Brigitte Handley have a fantastic, strong voice,Brigitte is quite the song writer having penned 3 songs herself and co-written 2 more on this CD.We start off with ""Control Freak"", a fast and angry song, which reflects on a demeaning relationship, ""Strap On"" brings up the subject of flakey people jumping on the subcluture bandwagon just to be popular, ""Zombie Earthquake"" is a great creepy stroller and ""Let's Go (PSYCHO)"" is so good, it's my new psychobilly anthem! ""Mean Cat Daddy"" and ""Rock Too Slow"" will rock your socks off!She does a cover of Batmobile's ""Mad At You"" on this disc AND features world famous Danny B Harvey on guitar...so what more could you ask for!?!?If you like psychobilly, and neo-rockabilly you'd love this CD! This is a fantastic Demo and I can't wait for a full length release from her."
5,Gift for my Mother!,"I bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it, I don't watch novelas, but I know she was once telling me about this one and when I saw it I decided to buy it for her."
5,Rosa de Lejos,"We used to watch Rosa de Lejos on the multicultural station in Australia, and for whatever reason it became very popular in the punk rock scene. Everyone was fascinated by Leonora Benedetti, with the frequent zoom in close up of her face, always signifying something dramatic. It's a really good show. From Argentina. Las Malvinas Son Nuestra!"
1,Old and Cracked,"Okay, I didn't buy a new one. But the advertisement said, just as good as new. I guess the new was 20 years ago. The pages are so old I have to be careful when I flip them ... I probably will go ahead and buy a new one."
1,Crummy product with Toshiba brand,"I bought this as a basic DVD player and it lasted only a few months. Freezes up, won't play and generally frustrating. I am throwing it out since it works only intermittantly. I thought buying Toshiba would mean it would perform for a few years at least. Waste of money. Don't buy it."
1,Piece of junk,This Toshiba DVD player is modified by Northstar electronics to work with all regions. Somewhere along the way the product is overhauled beyond repair. The first player that was delivered refused to play. I returned it and asked that a Northstar technician personally test the next one to make sure it worked and was assured they would. The second DVD player arrived and I set it up. This player worked but only the left audio channel functioned. I am getting fed up with returning this product and will write this off. Next time I'll go to Wall-Mart.
5,Excellent so far,"I am British, living in the USA, so needed a multi-region DVD player to get my region 2 fix. This player has worked great so far; it's played everything that I put into it with no complaints. I might recommend that anyone that gets one of these, and doesn't mind a bit of bawdy humour, buys Green Wing from Amazon.co.uk to test it with."
3,Something is wrong here...,"Just browsing through these reviews, I tend to notice that they seem staged or sort of insincere. I click on the reviews and the majority of the authors have never written another review besides this one... only like 5 of the 34 reviewers have written another review, and of those few half of the reviews were negative.Maybe I'm being a little paranoid here but I for one am not going to trust these reviews. I'm picturing a scandelous little company doing shoddy modifications to the players and then setting up a bunch of email addresses to write glowing reviews with.I could be wrong though... just really look at these reviews and judge for yourself."
1,"Plays it all, Could be region free?","Addendum.... Well after a year of low use the toshiba has become quite finicky and freezes on many dvds. I would lower my rating to 2 stars ** if I could. Bought a philps 5982 and have had no problems.Pros: Great picture. Screen saver a plus. 28 character file read. So far it has played every disc I have tried. Great picture. Plays divx, and xvid. Plays dvdr+ and dvdrw+ although the manual does not state it. Could be region free. Search videohelp.com sd-3990. Performed very well with the divx test cd 2.0. Automatically sets picture format.Cons: Very flimsy cd/dvd tray. Manual fails to mention you must have the dvd player hooked up via standard video mode for initial setup. RGB Composite mode hookup out of the box only shows a blank screen."
1,thsi is not good,"i bought this dvd player december 20th,2006.sometimes dvd skipps,but it was fine until today which is the end of december 2007.if i try to buy dvd player,i was hoping to last more than 2years.it didn't happened.after using 1year and i had to buy another dvd player,this is not good.don't buy this one."
2,Garbage,"One week after the 90 warenty period ended, the player stopped being able to recognize when discs were inserted. In this case, you get what you pay for - a low price for a low end machine that broke quickly. Also, not intuitive to set up, you have to plod through an instruction manual, which was a pain."
2,Only worked for 10 months.,"I bought this DVD player to play DVD's from Australia. It worked great for about 10 months with very light use. However, it started freezing up and not reading discs. After doing research, I learned that the laser lights on these machines are very weak and don't last long. It's cheaper to buy a new one than to get it fixed.Hold out for a better product."
1,Broke after 6 months of use..... :(,"I spent $60 on this and it broke after 6 months.. I guess the old saying, ""you get what you paid for"" is true.:("
4,Good solid product,"On the downside the reason for this purchase was to replace its predecessor which had mysteriously ceased to function - hence the loss of 1 star in the recommendation as I expect a brand like Toshiba to go on and on. Having said that this DVD does the job very well, playing DVDs from across the world without problems. With the pricing of these machines I guess it's a no-brainer to buy a new one if you happen to be unlucky enough to get one that goes wrong. Recommended."
1,Disappointing,"Unit arrived defective, wouldn't play any of my DVD's. Plus design and construction is very cheap compared to my current player. Will choose a Pioneer unit as a replacement."
4,Capable and well-priced,"After a few months of use, I am very satisfied with this player. It has a few faults, but on the whole has performed exactly as needed.Cons: No time counter or title/chapter display on the front panel. Sometimes rejects discs burned on low-quality media. Does not fast-forward well on many burned discs, especially with high compression ratios. Does not auto-resume; unlike most players, if you turn it off in the middle of a movie and then turn it on again the player does not start playing from where you left off. This is the only fault which I found really unforgivable.Pros: Plays absolutey every brand and format of recordable media I can throw at it. DVD+R, -R, -RW, and +R/DL all work like a charm, even the cheapo 35 cent discs which give other players siezures. This is what I purchased the player for, and it delivers. Well worth the $50."
5,DVD player,"I love it, the reason i bought it was to watch one specific movie and it was worth every penny, because it plays my dvd's perfectly."
1,Piece of junk!,"I probably used this machine less than 5 times. It, like my other Toshiba DVD player, just stopped working. Toshiba tech support is worthless. They referred me to a document that told me to clean the tray and make sure I had the correction region. Totally insulting! I would never, ever buy another Toshiba a/v machine."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,"This is not from toshiba. Northstar ""modified"" the player and guess what it does not work. Do not waste your money. When Northstar was contacted got the run around telling me it was ups fault the box arrived in perfect condition, they don't know what they are doing. Do Not Waste Your Money. Finally they relented and are sending me a Return authorization. I will never ever deal with these people again beyond disappointed."
1,Give Me Strength,"Never in my life have I despised a mere machine as I do this dinky thing.Bought it (via online auction, you know the one) because I have a Toshiba TV also with what they call ColorStream.Where do I begin?The tray release is eensy-weensy and must be pressed and re-pressed before it deigns to open or close.In fact, all the controls are eensy-weensy and irritating to finagle.Gimcrack is the word for this item, a thing so cheap and flimsy it will hardly sit down on a shelf.But then, I despise the accompanying manual just as fiercely.Some labor group must have PAID Toshiba to deliberately mislead and confuse and omit information from the defenseless consumer.The front panel lights up and says ""NO"" instead of ""ON.""That really sums it up.Next time I see a Toshiba product, I too will say NO NO NO NO, and a thousand times NO!"
2,Mine Lasted 2.5 years,I use the player infrequently and after 2.5 years it has stopped working. It tries and tries to load a disk but it just won't. The Toshiba website suggests unpluging the player for 2-3 minutes to see if that resolves the problem. It didn't. Prior to the breakdown it was a fine unit - never had any problems or quality issues.
2,Subtitle Features Work Poorly,"This DVD player handles both Region 1 and Region 2 films, but the subtitle feature is a problem. Changing the settings on the screen during initial setup of the movie doesn't translate to changes while watching it - only pressing the subtitle button on the remote affects that. But more annoying is that often the subtitles appear too low to be read completely. Resizing the screen made no difference in my ability to see them. The same films work perfectly on my Mac, which is set to Region 2; the subtitles are clear and easily viewed. So I'm retiring this DVD player and trying a Philips DVP5990, which got better reviews. Here's hoping...."
1,Broke within 6 months,Just wanted to put my 2 cents in and let folks know that this machine just stops working for no reason. Sad cause it was great while it lasted....
3,It dosen't play all zones.,"I have at home Russian DVDs region 5 and region ALL. Both of them are legal DVDs (not copies from computer)I took both my DVDs to SEARS and asked sales person to connect DVD player to the TV. When we put DVD region 5 DVD into DVD player it gave us ""Wrong region"" but it played DVD ""Zone ALL"""
4,"Nice, light-weight and simple player.","Bought this as a second player for my kids' German DVDs. Very sleek design. Light-weight, easy to move, takes up little space. Have not ""played with"" any extra functions (not even the remote), just plugged it in (no programming necessary)and watched DVDs since. Very good picture quality; you cannot tell that they are PAL movies. 4 (instead of 5) stars simply because of the flimsy tray. Would give 4 1/2 pts if possible."
1,Broke within just over 3 months,"I got this from Sears for $59.99 and it failed just outside the warranty period (which is 90 days). When I put a DVD in it says loading and then ""no"" - which means it can't read the disc.We watch maybe three or four DVD's a week and I am truly disappointed with the purchase. The machine was easy to use with a good remote control and is also slim (which is a nice feature). I was hoping to have this for a few years but it is not going to happen."
1,Broke after 9 months of light use!,"I agree with the previous reviewers comments. The screen says ""bad disk"" when you put in perfectly good DVDs. The same DVDs work fine in my laptop. The only reason we bought this player is that the salesman at Best Buy convinced us it is a wonderful player for the price. Since I was about to have a baby I didn't have time to research this more thoroughly. This is absolute garbage. Save your money for something better!"
1,do not buy me,this dvd player stopped working shortly after purchase and there was no warranty nor reimbursement!!!!!! please do not buy it!!!!!
1,Worked great for 3 months,"While originally worked fine, after only maybe 12 movies, the unit would not power up. The display would light dimly but the disc drawer would not eject. Eventually, the display went completely dark and the unit was pronounced dead. Bought another brand, for less money, and ended up with nicer features. This unit did not set it's own time nor did the remote work the TV controls as does the newer unit."
2,worked for over a year.,This is the second all region player I have owned. This one worked fine for over a year and then the picture began to stutter. My last one had this problem too only it went out much earlier after I bought it. If you read reviews of all region players it seems many of them from all companies often don't work for long periods. I now have to go on to another one as this one no longer does subtitles as well. I had a phillips before so I am hestitant to buy one of those again either. So I would say if one of these becomes available try a different model.
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"I received this as a gift about 14 months ago and earlier this week I suddenly got the ""No Disc"" message everyone else seems to get. I searched every corner of the internet for a solution. I opened it up and unplugged things and replugged them (yes, I did the ribbon thing that worked for some people) but nothing fixed it, not even shaking it or hitting it. Because of this, I will never buy Toshiba. How about a recall???"
1,It can't get all the way through a decent rental disk,"See my review of the Philips DVP642. I've owned both of these players, and they're both the same -- essentially useless for watching rental DVDs (that are confirmed to play just fine on other ""cheap-o"" DVD players like the APEX 1500).Don't bother with this one."
2,Great for a while,We bought this player a couple years ago and it worked great up until a month ago. Out of the blue it wouldn't power up if you pushed the power button on the unit. We had to use the remote. Then after a week or so it wouldn't power up at all unless we unplugged it. Then again after a few days I had to unplug it several times to get it to power up. Finally a few more days later it died all together.We also have the sister model SD-3960 which works well except the door won't open on it's own most of the time.
1,Very disappointed,"Used it very lightly, only for DVDs outside our region, but it still died in less than a year. We keep getting the message ""no disc."""
1,Player broke after only 4 months of light use!,"I bought this DVD player because I trusted the Toshiba brand after owning 2 Toshiba TV's over the years and being very pleased with them. Needless to say I have owned this DVD player for only 4 months and now it refuses to play any disks. I have put in several brand new DVD movies into the player and it keeps saying ""Bad Disc"" on the screen. Or, it will get to the main menu and then freeze. I've tried everything I can think of to make it work, but the machine is clearly broken. I only watch about 1 DVD a week, and am very gentle with the player so I can't imagine why it suddenly has stopped working (other than poor craftsmanship). Of course, the Warranty is only good for 3 months, so I've just wasted $60 on a player that I now have to replace. I am very disappointed with this product, and definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND it."
2,One year working life,"I have to agree with the numerous negative reviews of this player, all having to do with short lifespan. I have been extremely disappointed with Toshiba products lately - this dvd player, returned a laptop, etc. I now feel bad about recommending Toshiba to friends based on experience from years ago when Toshiba was at the top of their game. Anyway, this was a great player for one year, then it died. It really kind of boggles me because basic DVD players have matured, and you should be able to buy anything off the rack and it should just work for years. Toshiba has cost me some money because I now have to shell out another $70-90 for some other machine."
1,No disc error,Very poor quality DVD player; it started giving the no disc error after only 3 months of very light use. I have to agree with the previous reviews that it's quite surprising from a good brand like Toshiba.
3,Received free replacement after warranty expired,"We bought this SD 3990 DVD player after Christmas 2006. It stopped working in May 2007. Even though it was well past the 90 day warranty period, I called Toshiba customer support in August to report the faulty player. They told me to send it back and they would send me a new one. Since they didn't have 3990s, they replaced it with a 4000. I only had to send the player and a copy of my receipt and pay about $8 to ship it to them. I got the replacement 7 days later."
1,Died Quickly,"This was a warrantee replacement for another Toshiba DVD player, which also died young.Toshiba sent a new one at no charge, but I had to ship the defective one back. That cost about $20.00.I'll just put this one in the trash and save some money. Toshiba was good stuff at one time but now based on this experience, it's JUNK."
2,"good player, but short lasting","It worked great, any region DVD's played without changing any settings. After 2 months though it broke on me and said 'no disc' whenever I inserted one. Too bad.."
1,short life span,"Sure it is great, when it works. We've had problems with this product sporatically since purchase. Now, 5 months after purchase it is incapable of loading a DVD altogether. It looks like other customers are having the same problems. With almost $50 in shipping, this DVD player cost us more than $20 a month for it's life."
4,Don't Be Fooled By The Cover Art!,"It's too bad that CANDY ROCK never got a US release, for, despite the super kawaii cutesy cover art, it's a solid rock effort squarely in the Shonen Knife tradition. A couple of other things that may put off US fans:none of the songs are sung in English (unusual for a SK Japan release), and the entire CD lasts only half an hour. No matter, as there's some great stuff to be heard on CANDY ROCK. MASS COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN, MESSY ROOM, CROSS WORD and NAZO are standout rockers. WONDER LAND has a Neil Young-ish country feel, and the disc's final tune, MONKEY BRAND OOLONG TEA, is just lovely. I'll restate my position that Shonen Knife is among the most underappreciated bands on Earth...get this while you can."
1,Michie's legacy,"After Michie left Shonen Knife, the band turned into a twosome for a while, and it's almost as if they had the wind kicked out of their sails. Candy Rock is maybe the most eclectic, diverse, and experimental of their later albums. The record wasn't strong enough to attract a U.S. release, and it's the one record that doesn't even have tracks available for download purchase.""Heavy Songs,"" ""fun!fun!fun!,"" ""Happy Hour,"" and ""Super Group"" show more assurance with tight melodies and catchy songwriting. It's the one Shonen Knife record that could only listen to a couple of times, sadly."
2,It was just okay,"I was looking forward to reading this book after reading the other reviews. The book was ""just okay"". I also have two other books by this author based on reviews. I hope I won't be equally disappointed."
4,"i'm a reader, i read books, that's what i do..","This book is rediculous, the charachter development is so good! There seems to be a lot of charachters but McCrae does such a great job of defining each one very distintively that you can easily keep up with everything. The book really seems like it would be a great movie..I hope it does..I love books/movies like this that have tons of things going on and you are trying to connect them all together and then suddenly everything is revealed..and this book does not fail in the ""twisting plot"" department. A lot of the characters are so weird..you start to wonder why Max (the main character) doesn't punch a lot of people in the face."
3,Too Short,"This novel was a good read, what there was of it. The actual story part of the book is only 183 pages. The character development was pretty good but most of the scenes felt too rushed. IMO it is not worth $17. If you can find it cheap or get it as part of one of amazon's deals then i recommend it. Otherwise I wouldn't pay the amount they are asking for it."
2,"well, o.k.","well, it was O.K. Not really a great story. Seemed a great deal like a ""formula story"". Not really great charactors. Did not care about anyone. Did not really break new ground. I finished the book, but it was just O.K."
1,better books out there,I've been going on a zombie book jag. This is the weakest of the lot. Thin characters and plot and silly at times. I'd skip it.
3,A different take on the zombie genre,I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good zombie armageddon. It isn't very scary but it does offer another version of what a zombie could be.
3,It was OK,One of these oversized paperbacks that cost a little more. It was very short. I liked the brother and sister characters but had a little buyers remorse when I finished it. Should have been part of a collection or antholgy.
4,"Definitely different, but different is good.","This book is a different take on the zombie apocalypse. Set after the fall of mankind due to various biohazards, zombies are the only things that can withstand the sunlight. When a different kind of zombie pops up, the last of mankind is in trouble.Very nice. I like the way the characters interacted with each other."
1,The worst zombie book I've read,This has to be the worst zombie book I've read. You name a zombie book and I've probably read it. I have to say he tried to put a new spin on the genre but it didnt work. Stick to the classics. You cant go wrong. The book wasnt even scary. My favorite zombie series so far is Moody's Autumn series. Check those ones out if you want a good zombie book.
4,My own person,"This book is full of daily thoughts and human stories. Each day a new idea and thought to incorporate into your life. If you read them and actually act on them you will feel a new strength, a new sense, you become your own person. Some of the strongest emotions women tend to go through when they experience divorce is guilt and shame. This book will lift you up and make you see that you are wonderful, but most importantly how to love yourself. I liked this book, I liked the quotes and the one liners at the bottom of every page. You learn and really think about your life. This was a nice companion to assist with that change."
4,daily meditations,"I find this book helpful with what I am going through. Somedays the writtings are a little ""out there,"" but it mostly feeds my soul with daily inspirations and keys to working through such a difficult time for anyone."
5,A Riveting Mystery You won't want to miss.,"Robbie Britt's murder mystery, ""Dead Men Don't Deal"" is just that, a real mystery that is impossible to figure out who done it. Sophia the main character has to get involved when Randy her cousin who is like a brother to her becomes one of the suspects. The story is jam packed with potential suspects that will keep you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out the perpetrator. Like all good mysteries you don't want to put it down until you've finished it. This is truly a must read for all of you mystery lovers, don't miss it.Reviewed by:Norman Chenoweth author of""The Invisible Patriots""http://web.tampabay.rr.com/wnorman"
5,Pratchett Whimsy Mapped,Love Pratchett's books and enjoy searching through the Guide and included map for all the references to his delightful novels.
5,A wonderful resource for new and experienced doulas,"I was very excited to find this book. Ms Kelleher has done a wonderful job of articulating her point - that postpartum doulas are NEEDED and that our work is very important. We aren't just babysitters or housekeepers, but we are nutruring women (men) who strive to make the postpartum experience easier and better for the family - the long-term results of this support are admirable! She has given us practical tips to use in our carreers, as well as some important reminders to keep us on the right track. Thank you for a wonderful resource! I look forward to taking the DONA doula training and becoming a DONA certified postpartum doula!"
4,A wonderful resource,"Mark Graham Brown has produced another useful, direct, and informative business book. I found the checklists and interview questions especially helpful in my executive coaching and consulting practice.A couple of clients dampened my enthusiasm with concerns over terminology and level of sophistication for implementation, but the material actually helped me to pinpoint their concerns and address their questions. If you're doing Scorecards, get this book."
3,I enjoyed the audio book & I would recommend to friends,I wish the book would have developed greater depth to recommendations and techniques. I enjoyed the audio book & I would recommend to friends.
4,The Wailers,"This is not only Bob Marley, but it's the original Wailers. Singing great songs on here such as Cheer Up, Can't You See, Go Tell it on the Mountain, Soul Captives, Soon Come, Hold on to This Feeling, Mr.Chatterbox, and all the instrumental takes at the end. This is a good collection of songs from the Wailers of 1969-70. And if you want the songs that came right before this, see Rock to the Rock, and Selassie is the Chapel, both inwhich I reviwed. And there is also a story behind this CD. Buy and it will explain. Along with keep you going with good Wailer music."
4,Sweet music from before I was born...,"If Sugar Sugar (an amazing groove party to be listened to over and over) is not enough reason to pick up this album, then Stop the Train, Soul Shake Down, etc. sure make this a spectacular album for anyone interested in The Wailers or in the rhythms that are at the heart of reggae music."
1,Best To Avoid,I bought this crud at Newbury Comics in Boston and the best thing about it was being able to throw it in the trash six hours later. Awful and insulting.
3,"Love curious George, hate the US DVDs","My son (& I ) love curious George. It's a great show & these episodes are no different. What I don't like are the US DVDs, they are rife with ads. In Australia we have limitations on kids ads so I was surprised they were on there at all, the UK versions I'd bought in the past did not. But the US ones have obnoxious ads for things like 'chunky cheese' (!) at the start. They also have educational snippets between episodes which are kind of OK, although a little seasame st for my tastes.The UK DVDs have the same shows in a more pleasant format."
4,Entertain ing for your kids,This DVD is entertaining and educational and cute. My sons enjoyed and even learned a thing or two about recycling
5,I love it,the tea is of great taste and the miracle it does is even better than what I thought it would do. I really recommend it
3,Good songwriting,"The songwriting is good from Nina, but the tempo of the songs is often a little too slow and too similar. Instrumentation could have been recorded more forcefully as well."
3,Not the best cozy I've ever read,"Up to this book I've been enjoying the Pennyfoot Hotel series. I like the seaside Georgian setting, and I like the recurring characters (especially the maid Gertie). This book still has the characters and that is good, but the story was definitely lacking in plot and in suspense. It is almost simplistic in its style, and I did not enjoy that. I love the cozy genre, but I love a multi-layered story that keeps me coming back in order that I can learn what is happening to the characters that I have come to love. This book did not do it for me this time, but I will try some more, and hope for better."
3,A good series to read,"My favorit book of the pennyfoot hotel murder mystery series is ""service for two"" its the 3rd book in the series. but it's always good to start with the first book which is this one. its a really good series to read and try to solve yourself. set in the early 1900's it's relaxing to read a book set in a simpilar time period."
3,Look closer: Are these model plans REALLY sprawl alternatives?,"Check out some of the final subdivision design parameters on page 87. While other reviewers might benefit from the author's justified concern for conserving open space--especially in communities where cookie-cutter style developers 'rule the Board', the end result for some of the plans in this work APPEARS to be large-lot American sprawl, with ecological considerations that don't go far enough. Perhaps Arendt's GROWING GREENER, which I've not seen, will get us closer(?)"
4,More people need to read this book!,"What a concept! Rather than trying to get the most acreage per lot, make smaller lots with more shared open space. A must read for every developer, planning board, and zoning commition. Easy to follow examples show how to preserve historic and environmental features while adding to the value of the land that is developed."
2,Not Enough Russian Dolls and Too Long,"I had wanted to see this movie for a long time, because of my interest in Russian women. There is little in this movie about Russian dolls. Only a side plot which becomes the main plot toward the end. Xavier, the main character, is somebody you can't feel for, a shallow guy, that you really don't care what happens to him. The movie is long and boring, and needs a good editing job. At least 40 minutes could be cut and nothing would be lost. This rambling movie has little direction and has a predictable ending."
2,"Tries to be charming, but fails on many levels","The plot is uneven, with various characters getting lost and simply acting as foils for the main character, the love story sort of comes out of nowhere, and I agree with the other viewer who says that Romain Duris has no business carrying this movie. UGH, he has no ability to act as the central character, lacks the necessary looks, wit or charm -- or acting depth. Good grief, he has nothing going for him. I did not see the original of which this is a sequel, but a 2/5 is a very generous rating for this movie, which is thrown together at best."
3,A modern love story mostly in French,"The open life style of these young well educated Europeans isfar from traditional. Xavier is shown sleeping aroundand having an openly lesbian best friend-room mate.They appear to be looking in every place possible for""LOVE"" as if that were more important than anything else in life.Most ordinary people who would try to live like this would end up in disaster?!As touching and well written as the script may be,it is also a prescription for social problems.Western society seems to be stretching the edges of moral decayand encouraging the young on a road that may not endin anyone being happy or healthy?"
2,Not a book for people looking for trading education,"I guess I'm spoiled by Martin Schwartz's excellent book Pit Bull. I was expecting a trader's autobiography something along the same line with The Day Trader, but what I got was the first 130 pages of Borsellino talking about what a tough guy he is and about his mafioso father. After that he dips into a high-level discussion of the changes to the commodities and NASDAQ exchanges over the years. There is virtually no mention of trading technique or psychology, outside of the constant tough guy braggadocio, which is pretty sad to hear from a 40-year-old guy. And definitely don't buy it if you're looking for trading advice or techniques. There is none to be found. If you want a nice biographical read about a trader, read Pit Bull or Reminiscences of a Stock Operator instead. Borsellino simply doesn't write well enough to keep this one interesting. The story wanders around too much and is too repetitious."
1,Terrible!,This book was one of the worst I have ever read. It is so much about his life and nothing about even trading that its a complete bore. He goes on and on about his life stories and is always pumping himself with compliments. A total waste of money!
1,This is the worst book on the markets I've ever read,"Complete was of time and money. I couldn't care less about Borsellino's father, or family life. If I could sell the book short, I would."
2,"Not a trading book, but not too boring a story","Dont know whether I had not expected much from this book or what,(I had read through many negative reviews here on Amazon that I know this is not the type of tool book nor sheer biography that one might expect), it is not so boring to me. However, in a trader reader perspective, it is at least 2,000 pips (in yen/$ term, the range in 2002) below the quality level of ""Reminiscences of a stock operator"" and ""Pit Bull"". So unless you had no other book in your mind that you wanna read or you are a contrarian, I strongly recommend you to spend your valuable time on other ones, like those I mentioned above, or scan through the Amazon database for better alternatives."
3,"Entertaining autobiography, but not a ""how-to"" manual",This is a light and pleasurable read for those who like to acquaint themselves with hevy-hitters in the trading industry. Tells of Borsellino's life before and during the trading phase. Don't look for trading tips.
3,worth a look,"The beginning of the book is great but he gets too bogged down with the story of his father, his money management firm, and what the merc and cbot need to do. However, a interesting story of a champion trader."
1,"The Day Trader, From the Pit to the PC","I expected, from the title, a book that would provide some insight into day trading. I wouln't have bought the book had I known that is was an autobiography of the son of a convicted thief, that the author wrote exclusively about himself, and that he provided nothing helpful or interesting about the topic one would expect from the title."
1,Totally embellished story,"Louis Borsellino embellished every aspect of this story. If you talk to other traders on the floor, and people from Montini High School in Lombard,IL; they will tell you the real story."
1,Not trading oriented,The book can be summarized as follows: the first half dwells on father-son relationship in an Italian family in which the father is connected to the Mob. The second half is a meandering discussion on the future of trading - will it go electronic and if so what will be the organizational structure. If you are looking to improve your trading skills or obtain insights into trading you will be sorely disappointed. On the other hand if you are looking for a frank and honest background on Lewis Borsellino then this book is for you.
1,A real snooze,"This is a great book to give away to your clients and prospects, but I don't think you should pay for self promotion such as this. If you who are novice traders out there are looking for info or insight into what trading is really like you could do yourself a favor and leave this book off your reading list. If you are interested in an honest opinion from an insider at the Merc on where trading is going, then this is a book you should read."
1,Too Much Talk About Fighting,"I was expecting a lot from this book, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. The book delves too much into how many fights the author has been in, how Italian-Americans are always accused of being mobsters and how his convict dad wasn't a bad guy. Not enough useful information for would be traders, but plenty of information about the author's money management firm, fighting and his dad."
1,A boring ego trip,"What do you do when you want to glorfy yourself, but don't have enough material for a book? Puff it up, then have your friends submit favorable reviews to Amazon.com. Insights into day/electronic trading? Borsellino offers nothing that can't be found in a ""How to trade"" pamphlet from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A much wiser investment of time and money would be Marty Schwartz' ""Pit Bull."""
1,"5 stars on BS, 1 on book content",I've never seen such a poorly written day trading book. Absolutely nothing that I cant find in countless other books. Dont waste your money.
1,pure garbage....... strong arming/futures don't mix,"It's very sad that someone would write something like this just to write. This book has no business being called the day trader, Wiley Publishing you should be ashamed of yourself."
5,"AWSOME,FINALLY A PROFESSIONALS HONEST REAL ACCOUNT",THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I'VE SEEN FROM A REAL PRO WITH EXPERIENCE ON THE INSIDE OF THE TRUTH ABOUT DAY TRADING. THE SINCERITY IS THAT THE AUTHOR IS NOT SELLING ANYTHING! HE IS TELLING THE WHOLE STORY INCLUDING THE SERIOUS RISKS INVOLVED AND HOW MUCH A BEGINNER DOESN'T KNOW. HE'S MADE HIS MILLIONS AND IS THE SUPERTRADER I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WOULD HAVE BEEN MY OPPONENT.HIS REAL LIFE DRAMA IS INCREDIBLE.
2,Misleading Title!,"You know when they say ""Don't judge a book by it's cover?"" Well here's a living proof of it! Well, the book is not about day trading. I founs perhaps around 3 or 4 sentences that talk about day trading and that's about it. The authors has focused more on his personal life. This should be named an Autobiography of Borsellino instead.However, he is a good writer and has written pretty well, I must say. His personal life experiences are very touching and interesting to read about. He does warn us in the beginning that he will be talking about his life, but I did not expect it to be of such *great* extent. Perhaps he believes that if we know about his personal life, and understand it deeply, then we will be better traders.The reason I am assigning a 2-star is just because of the misleading title of the book. But it doesn't mean that Mr. Borsellino is not a good writer. He writes very well indeed!Thank you, Steve."
1,OMERTÀ ON TRADING SECRETS,"A hot contender for the title of worst trading book ever written. Rather than a discussion of the one issue that might lead one to respect the author - his trading - he subjects his readers to 200 pages of whingeing about his victimization on account of his father's mafia connections. While Mr. Borsellino goes to extraordinary lengths to deny that he has maintained these, he produces such a mind-numbingly tedious volume that one begins to wonder whether its publisher took the decision to publish on the basis of an ""offer he couldn't refuse""."
1,The worst TRADING BOOK EVER WRITTEN!,"This book is not about trading, it is about all the people Lewis and his father beat up. Borsellino must know something about trading but he fails to demonstrate it in this poorly written narrative of is his dysfunctional upbringing. I am embarrassed to have paid money and spent the time reading this book."
1,Boring account of life as a local in the pit.,"This tome will have little to offer anyone outside the pit in terms of practical information about trading.It dwells excessively on the authors heritage and the influence of his father. I found Marty Schwartz' PIT BULL to be a more entertaining story about the life of a trader. The one gem in the book is the author's revelation that he traded upwards of 250,000 contracts per year and his admission that if he had to pay normal retail clearing commissions he would not have made any money at all."
1,On-floor commentary,It has been said on the floor that Lewis Borsellino has now written more books than he has read.
3,State NOT included,"The description for this item erroneously states that it ""Includes one FREE 1040 Electronic Filing, a FREE TurboTax State download"". I can find no reference to it on the actual product.If you need the State version, be sure to get ""TurboTax Total Tax Solution Premier 2005 with State"".If you have used TurboTax in the past, also be prepared for another major change to the interface. It's not bad, but some things, such as the hybrid vehicle deduction, are hard to find and can easily be overlooked if you aren't already aware of them."
2,Mac users beware!,"I did my taxes on this program, saved the file, and went to dinner. Ever since I have been unable to open the file. The tech-support people know that there is a problem, but it has been over a week and they have not solved it. Their suggested solution is to burn your tax file to a CD, take it and your original CD to a Windows computer, install a Windows version of TurboTax, open your file, take out the password, save the file, burn it to a CD, and return to your Mac with your fingers crossed, hoping for the best. I do not have a Windows computer, so this does me no good.For at least one week Intuit has failed to address this problem successfully. In the meantime, I have gone to the local IRS office for forms, and will be doing my return the old-fashioned way.Other than not being functional, the program looks good, so I give it two stars for its pretention."
2,State Return Extra,Be careful the version is federal only and you are required to pay an additional $29.95 for the state version. My bad let the buyer beware and read more carefully.
3,TurboTax State download,"I was able to download the State return for free, although it is not intuitive (no pun intended). You must start a return, and then the ""Online"" selection appears at the top. Select ""Download State"" under ""Online"". It will walk you through your state selection and ask you to pay for a state return. Look closely and you will see a hyperlink which says something like ""I have already purchased this"". You will then go to a form with a place to fill in the order number and confirmation number - but I didn't have either! There also is a telephone number 1-800-325-1558. You have to call the number go to Sales and give the person the serial number which also appears on the screen. The salesperson will give you the order number and confirmation number (provided you have purchased Deluxe or Premier). And you thought taxes were hard!!I have not used any of the software yet, so I am giving it 3 stars because of the lack of user friendliness on this feature."
2,State is NOT included and will cost more,"I've been using TurboTax for 8+ years and recently, the Premiere version. This package is NOT a good package if you intend to file a state return. The additional cost of downloading the state add-on is $29.95. Compare this to the bundled package price of $69.99, and you end up paying more.VERY disappointed this product is being marketted without the state add-on. This will be the last time I buy this online from Amazon."
5,Fast and easy,"I'm a tax attorney, and I spent many years preparing my returns by hand, including multiple different schedules. Two years ago, I threw in the towel and went to TurboTax. I've been delighted with the thoroughness with which it solicits necessary information and rolls it into an accurate return. My only complaint is that the AMT calculation function does not provide adequate explanation to understand and answer many of the data prompts."
4,Federal Taxes for Idiots,"We have used this product for the last three years and find it very easy to prepare our taxes, particularly the section that deals with mutual funds and stocks sales, losses, gains, etc. The program asks you questions and your answers end up in the right forms and/or worksheets, which you can later print or save to a PDF file and, of course, you can e-file, if you so desire.The only problem we encountered was that when asking questions, if that particular item did not apply to you, it sometimes got into a loop and the only way we found to get around it, was to exit the program and then come back. The program always asks you if you want to save, so you would not loose any of the work already entered."
4,Heavy and brutal,"Short but sweet: I found these guys on Metal Archives, listened to their stuff on YouTube and came here to Amazon to order their album (wow, just dawned on me that had I typed this 25 years ago, none of this would've made sense -how listening to music has changed).The long and short of it is these guys are heavy and brutal. The production is thick -a bit modern more my taste, the guitars are heavy, the bass is peppered and the drums are fantastic... With the exception of the snare drum, a bit too ringy but again, that's me. Overall a great brutal death metal album... I recommend getting this!"
5,Great Ska from Down under!,"This is an absolutely fantastic ska album. Right from track 1, the album breaks into catchy rythms that will stay in the head for days. The best tracks on here are ""Ex Factor"" and ""Chemical Imbalance"". These guys are a relatively little known band from Newcastle, but that does not mean they dont rock. Ska fans from the US and all around the globe should give this album a try, they will not be disappointed!"
2,"The Porkers go down under, literally","This follow up to GRUNT!, just does not compare. A sleeper album with very few catchy songs. Majority of the songs are wacky and plain stupid. Not that the band was ever anything else, but on the last album they made up for their pokey-ness with their catchy lyrics and horn section, some how that was lost in this new album. I am surprised Moon wasted their money on this one."
4,Let's Go: Switzerland and Austria--12th Edition,"I am a long, long-time fan of the Let's Go! series, and this edition does not disappoint."
2,Chilton's - 1994 Corvette,Its impossible for the car to change once it comes out but do the Chilton Books on how to repair them change?This book is absolutely useless.I would recommend purchasing an updated Chilton's from your local auto repair shop.
3,Chilton book just O.K.,"I have just started doing multiple maintainance projects on a 94 coupe. Chilton helps but since the book spans the complete C-4 generation it can be confusing depending on which engine you have. There is a critical error on spark plug gap. The books gives .035 for all years. The later models take a .050 gap. Double check your year before install. It is difficult to get the plugs in, you don,t want to do it twice. The graphics in the book are not great and the black and white pictures seem hard to see in some cases."
5,great stuff!,"I just got Diva, and have only listened to some of it, but already I have a favorite -- ""Primitive"". No need to look further for words to describe it, the reviewer from BA said it perfectly, and I can't even read Spanish -- ""atmosfera magica"". Indeed!"
4,Very nice,"With songs so consistently well-written and produced, Annie Lennox's solo debut is overall a mellower and enjoyable outing than most Eurythmics outings which generally had both superior and less-than-stellar moments. Not here. Two excellent songs - Why and Walking On Broken Glass - with the rest being very good. I especially liked the addition of Keep Young and Beautiful, which shows that humor has a place in pop."
5,SHE'S GOT IT ALL!!!!,"Five stars is not enough for this CD. Little Bird is one of the best, out of many that she has done. I have not heard one that I do not like!"
4,Awesome Album by the Europop/rock/soul Diva!,"Ignore the critics who say she has not earned her title to be a diva. I have to disagree she has been around for over a decade and has put out an amazing string of pop hits. She has more than earned her title. This album is heavy on ballad songs that fit her voice. My favorite is the midtempo ""Walkin on broken glass"" Which is an infectious melody noone can resist. In this current age of fake divas who havent even been around for that long its time that Annie Lennox gets the spotlight. She should be on the next Vh1 Divas Live show."
4,"Good, intelligent pop.","To a previous reviewer: ""Diva is an honorific to be bestowed, not claimed""? Don't condescend, and don't criticise a work just because you haven't read between the lines. The title is meant to be ironic, as testified by the videos,interviews and bonus track ""Keep Young And Beautiful"".That's precisely what gives the largely gentle album its refreshingly intelligent pop edge. She's playing with the role of the trapped and fallen ""diva"". But best of all, she still manages to provide some sincere and beatiful tracks which transcend these ironies (notably ""Why"" and ""The Gift""). All good stuff."
5,"TIMELESS, SOULFUL AND DEEP","I still listen to this album with deep wonder. It's an inspiration and a voice on my own life, feelings and experiences."
5,Annie Lennox is one of the greatest artists of all time,"this fantastic artist has the best compositions and voice. From the woeful ""Why"" to the glitzy fun ""walking on broken glass,"" this artist transcends through many styles. A diva she is and she proves it in this CD."
5,Timeless classic!,"Even after 5+ years of its first release, this CD is still appealing. For music fans of Annie Lennox, this one is definitely the one to own. Un CD muy bueno, con letras bastante conmovedoras. Muy recomendable."
3,She'd have done better to stay with Dave Stewart as producer,"Annie Lennox's desire to branch out on her own without Eurythmics other half is a limited success. Technically the sound is shimmering and intense, but lacks the ""soulful"" Celtic raggedness of the Eurythmics best rock 'n' roll. 3 stars."
4,Diva.... No Joke,"My list of favorite female vocalists is rather short but Annie is right at the top. This album is not perfect but it sure is good. She could recite the alphabet and make it sound superb. I finally got to hear her live this past summer and she had the most powerful voice I've ever heard. The majority of her concert consisted of songs from this cd and they sounded as fresh as the first time I heard them. ""Why"" ""Cold"" and ""Money Can't Buy It"" are fantastic. This is a must-have collection of songs."
5,simply wonderful,this book offers an inside look at potentially the greatest investor to ever live. it should be mandatory reading in every MBA program in the country.
4,"Good start, lacks depth",This book is a good primer for understanding concepts like ROE and P/E ratios but lacks deeper valuation methodology. I'm sure that these quick litmus tests are needed but I am still trying to find a book with better techniques. The book provides a good example of analyzing for growth in the last or second to last chapter. Any other recommendations are welcome.
3,"Systematic & true, but not for a small capital investor","Perhaps this is the best book I ever read about investment. It will reveal a step by step process for a beginner to become a true investor like Warren Buffett himself (note: beginner here means people with MEGABUCKS). Also the languange was written very good, makes me easy to catch the essence of Buffett's wisdom. Unfortunately, at the end I finally found that the result of the method for selecting stocks, will ended with mature stocks that is of course very good but very expensive also!Anyway, I will try to give a fair sharing about this book: 1. It's true in my opinion & written very systematically (easy to understand). For the people with a lot of money, I higly recommend this book. 2. For common beginner who wants to find out method of finding a good stock but lack of capital, don't buy this book. Better you keep your money to increase your capital."
3,Light & Easy,"For the person whose interested in ""Buffett Style Investing 101"", this book is a good place to start. It is very easy reading, and the repetitive nature forces concepts onto the reader. The case studies walk the reader through both the math & the thought process.For those looking for a more comprehensive study of the man & his philosophies, checkout Lowenstein's book."
3,There is more to it,"Go ahead read this book learn the math. But before you actually use your new knowledge to invest read Snowball (a 830 page biography of Warren Buffett). That book will give you a more realistic idea of what it really takes to invest like Warren Buffett. The ability to crunch numbers backwards and forewords is not enough. Many fine financial analysts can do that. But you also have to be ""wired differently"" (that means ""wired"" like Warren himself). And how many investors can claim to be ""wired"" like Mr. Buffett?I hope no reader of this book was so busy learning business/investment calculations that they failed to notice that a few months ago Berkshire Hathaway was available for about $75,000 per share (about half price from all time high). Now it is $97,000."
4,This book give me the confidence to buy his shares,"This book help me understand the biggest enigma about Buffett: how Buffett will determine the price to pay for a stock he likes.This book is very good for beginers to learn about Warren Buffett's investment method. But don't stop there, read all the Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports and learn more about HOW HE THINKS!"
1,Buffettology? The title alone is a JOKE,"This book is a royal sham - not worth your time. There is little in this book worth reading. For starters, Mary ""Buffett"" has no right to use that last name... She's no more a Buffett than your gold-digging neighbor. The supposed formulas that she profers as belonging to Buffett in reality have little to do with Buffett's methods or his thinking - he is on record many times as refuting what she claims as his method. What does she say about multi-disciplinary cross-examination of the investment problem set? Nothing. What does she say about how to define a moat and determine its durability? Very little. Instead we get her assumption on growth formulas... just where did she derive that? The family Thanksgiving dinner? Right. Of all the books on Buffett I've read (let's just say it's well into double digits) - this is perhaps the worst..."
2,Opportunism at its lowest,"No, no, no. Give me a break, Mary Buffett gets divorced and suddenly reinvents herself as a Buffett know-it-all. Come on if the ignorant out there think that by reading this book they will be able to replicate Buffett's success, then they still believe in the tooth fairy. Mary Buffett is doing nothing more than capitalising on her supposed discovery of the ""holy grail"". If she had, do you really think she would have to sell books? Besides many great minds have tried, and failed, at trying to replicate Warren's success. I find the book simplistic, patronising, and written as if the author has just discovered Finance herself. I would recommend potential readers look elsewhere for insights into the Warren Buffett mind, by more qualified authors."
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty handy book. Of course, like most books of this type, it could be a lot shorter.The basic principal: (1) find a company whose earnings are reasonably predictable, (2) make some sort of forecast of those earnings going forward ~10 years, (3) use the company's ROE to calculate what sort of value creation they should make with the portion of the earnings that aren't paid out as a dividend and (4) use the historic P/E range to imply some future stock price. Then use the current stock price to decide if you'll get a reasonable return on your investment."
3,"Very good for investment ideas, horrible math section","This book is fantastic at presenting what investors should look for in a company. From leaving poor industries such as oil and cars behind, and moving into less glamourous yet better industries such as foods and cable. I think the first half of the book, before the math section is great. As for the math section, it is terrible for valuation of companies and projections of earnings, a better guide would be ""The Warren Buffett Way"" by Robert Hagstrom, which makes real sense of investment math. I am pleased by the writers approach but am shocked by the poor math that they used in formulating valuations. A good first investment book, don't fret over the math when it makes no sense to you, switch to Hagstroms book."
2,"An oversimplified ""you can do it too"" bandwagon book","Buffetology is an oversimplified look at Warren Buffet's investment methods. The plodding, repetitious, and annoying description of ""Warren's"" process doesn't do justice to what can be found in the Berkshire Hathaway annuals and ""Owner's Manual"" (Check out Berkshire's website). A better, more useful, and thoughtful book is ""The Warren Buffet Way"".If you want to follow Buffet's methods, don't invest the money in this book. The return isn't there."
1,Terrible Terrible Book....Booooring,My first thoughts of this book were wow this is written by his ex-daughter in law??? I'll keep it brief since most negative reviews i've read through sum it up well enough..I found this book extremely boring and poorly written. It's mostly mundane math equations based on prior buffet picks..over and over and over again without ever making much of a point..I will grant the first few chapter were better then the latter half..though this could simply be because the more i read the boarder i became.
3,"Pretty good book on what companies Buffett might like, but too simple","The major strength of this book is the analysis of companies and their moat. The way how Warren looks at companies, especially the monopolies they might own. For that alone I would advise this book to Warren Buffett fans.The mathematics/calculations in this book on the other hand are presented pretty poorly. I would advise Jain his book on Warren Buffett instead to analyze the intrinsic value of a company or how to look at a financial statement or a balance sheet.All in all I'm a bit disappointed after reading this work. I have red better books on Buffett. I thought this would offer something new or extra on Warren Buffett, regarding the author shares the name and the numerous reviews here on Amazon. I would give this book 2,5* stars."
2,Pretty disappointing,"I picked up a couple of interesting concepts, but overall it didn't seem like she really knows how Warren evaluates a company. The Warren Bufffet Way by Hagstrom was much better."
4,A Kiss-and-Sell Book of Insight,"What do you do if you're the ex-daughter-in-law of a multibillionaire? Writing a kiss-and-tell book about Warren Buffett might not hold that much interest. But talk about the investment secrets of the greatest modern investor of all time, and that can get someone's interest.This is a fine book for beginning to intermediate investors or investors curious about ""Value"" investing.There are some really good beginner's breakdowns of the Buffett theory, in language a layman can understand. I think like all good chefs however, Mr. Buffett's secrets are even immune from his daughter-in-law's revelations.Of course, Mr. Buffett has changed some of his practices over the years, with the vast amount of money that he manages. Ms. Clark does an admirable job maintaining focus on the simple and elegant principles that drive this unique investment perspective."
2,Too basic,Anyone with an MBA or otherwise familiar with the valuation of companies does not need to read this.
1,a book with full of mistakes and stupility,"i can't imagine anyone could misunderstand warren buffett and misled readers by that much, like a student from elementary school trying to explain what is the practical meaning of calculus.don't follow it, instead, read the essays of warren buffett and you can tell the difference between truth and fake.i would have given negative grad if there had such."
5,ATTENTION: All Romance Lovers,"Romance, Action, Danger, Suspense....This book has it all! I LOVED it!!! This is my first book by author, Jane Graves, and it's going on the collector's shelf. Lisa and Dave are wonderful characters, who will captivate you from the start of the book, until the very last page. The secondary characters are great too! I want to tell all, but I'll let you find out for yourself. This is a must read for all you romance lovers. My only disappointment is that it ended! I wanted it to keep going."
4,excellent,"This album is neither as heavy or out there as you may gleen from the title.Basically, George Russel sets the suite up here using a simple blues line, but the horns run comblex subtitutions through this pattern. The piece strolls into some free impovasation--no steady beat so you are floating in space-then reestablishes the inital line.There is a fantastically recorded organ part, and eletronics subtlely placed through the piece. This is not free or soul jazz, but one of those projects from a master eccentric who takes elements from all kinds of both music and subgenres of jazz.Absolutely great record for fans of conventional or avant jazz."
3,"Repetitive, but has a few good stories","I picked up this book used because I love gay porn and threesomes. I'm glad I didn't pay full price because it really wasn't worth it.This is a collection of stories about three-way gay sex by a variety of different authors, but the most of the stories are very similar. You get the exact same scenario with characters who look different, have different names, or are in different locations. Some of the stories are hot, but none of them are terribly imaginative."
4,Open Mind...,"This book is so engaging. My co-worker, Mr. Johnson, graduated with an art history degree and had a keen eye for some of Robert Mapplethorpe's works that framed black men in extremely provocative poses. One afternoon after he offered me a few glasses of wine, he wanted me to open my mind a little to his way of life and read some of the stories in this book that he ordered from Amazon. And while I'm still a straight man, I can still appreciate any story about a trio... even if I prefer the female kind."
5,Philips PSS120 512 MB MP3 Personal Sound System Great Box,I've had this shoqbox 24 hours.Extremely pleased with everything about it. Please enjoy.
5,A Must for SAR,"This book is a must for SAR incident managers and team leaders. It is very useful for other SAR personnel. It does not give some magic formula that divulges where a lost person will be found, but it does cause searchers to think about assumptions they make, consciously or unconsciously, about the likely behavior of lost subjects. As is so often the case, what is really harmful is not what we do not know, but what we think we know that is not so.This is not a book for the casual reader who wants stories about SAR. It is a dry compilation of statistics on lost person operations. There are collections of stories and anecdotes that would be far more edyfying and satisfying, but for its intended audience of SAR professionals, this book is indispensible."
4,Great SAR tool for making evidence based decisions,"I was pleased with Mr. Syrotuck's approach to the topic of lost persons. It is completely evidenced based and factual. There are very little opinionated claims to cloud the judgement of the readers. This tool helps enables the SAR professional to make the best possible effort in finding persons based on age, mindset, and terrain. Thanks for the great effort and I'll look forward to reading your future works."
4,Very Interesting / Compelling,"Sandage and Shults blend two seperate expertise - therapy and theology into a good book on the topic of forgiveness. This book delves into the biblical concept of 'facing' reflecting the face of God to other people through your own face. And, this book stresses the need to forgive in the redemptive power that is found in community. Shults is at the top of his game in the book, easy to read yet highly intellectual at the same time - a hard pair to find in this day and age. Sandage is also good to read in this book - the two together equal a book that is recommended for all who are interested in this topic. JVD"
4,antill's very hard to get corroboree,"Snap this up while you can. It's very hard to get and deserves Harry Pearson's (The Absolute Sound)rave rating. Excellent dynamics, startling at times. Just a small note that the face mask on the album cover looks like an African tribal mask and quite unlike anything in an Australian aboriginal ceremony."
4,Sepultura mark 2's 3rd,"On my first listen to Roorback i wasn't too impressed but it grew on me very quickly. In this album the feel of each track is more prominant than the individual instrumants contributions (which by the way are excellent). Derrick Green is growing into his role and fulfilling his true potential as he deserves having seen his charisma live. Tracks like Mindwar, Corruption and More Of The Same are the highlights for me. Sepultura make a shaky step with Nation but have found their footing this time around, a class album. IGOR RULES!!! dont forget the hidden track"
1,Does not stay lit,"I am sorry to say but four out of 5 of the sticks did not consume, even a quarter of the way. I do like the smell and it was shipped in a regular manner. I might just had an old or deficient package as reading the review I seem to be alone with this problem."
5,Priceless,"When I moved from California to South Carolina, the store that was supposed to stock Juniper Ridge incense didn't. I tried to talk them into ordering it, but no dice. I bought another cedar incense off their shelf (Maroma) and there is no comparison.This is hands-down the best cedar incense I've ever tried. There's no flowery junk to get in the way. No charcoal, no potassium nitrate. It's just pure, sustainably wild-harvested cedar from the Pacific Northwest."
4,Very nice cedar incense,"We found this incense while on vacation and enjoy it at home regularly. It fills the house with an earthy cedar scent, but is not overwhelming. I'm online looking to buy more and am delighted to have found it on Amazon."
4,A multi-faceted history of the region,"This is a long overdue book about a region of the country that is generally overlooked by historians. The Southern Plains is defined as western Texas, Oklahoma, and eastern New Mexico. In eight essays by such notable authorities as Elliott West, Dan Flores, John Morris, and Diana Olien the reader is treated to the multi-faceted history of the region.It's all here, the history of human occupation, exploitation, the climate, land, resources, and the never-ending effort to build a future in an area that resists change. This is a must book for any reader remotely interested in the history and future of an area that occupies the center of the United States but is rarely understood."
4,I Like It,Informative small text from the subject area. I feel I can trust the information more because of this. I do believe this to be a good choice for those seeking information on this subject matter.
5,Good beginners book and in the long run a good reference,"This book will bring you up to speed very quickly if you're a beginner. If you already know about DHCP, this book makes a good reference manual. A lot of the content is repeated from one chapter to another, keeping you from having to flip back and forth to other chapters"
2,3M Anti-Glare Filter,"It does work, but if you have a flat screen monitor don't get it. There is no way for it to stay on it right."
5,"Very good book, but it's aimed at teen-agers.","I bought this book via amazon.com without knowing anything about it. The back dust jacket on the book says it was written for teen-agers. This means that this 140 page book lacks the details that a 600 page book would have, but it still has plenty of amazing details. It's written at the level of a magazine article, so adults don't have to feel like they are reading a juvenile book. But I must say that the details are amazing. I'm surprised it's legal to say as much as the author said. I enjoyed this book. At 140 pages and without complex sentences, it was a quick and easy read. Yet I came away from this book with a lot of information that I never thought would be publically available. The topics are the U-2, the SR-71, and a series of spy satellites. I recommend it."
2,Elementary But Now Outdated Overview,"The book is ten years old. Since it was published, there have been much more detailed works on satellite imagery and the new stealth aircraft. Whatever this contains on overhead reconnaissance sattellites was based on guess and informed speculation. As far as the knowledge of the Corona (see books) KH-4 program of the sixties, all has now been revealed in three major books and in numerous news accounts of the operations of the once black National Reconnaissance Office."
1,warning,"Got these for 13.39 [...] Looked good. Washed them. Wore one. No problem. Wore again and noticed the stitching coming out of the waist. 2nd wear! Had already ordered 4 more. Tried to cancel, called, cut off. Called, leave msg. Called, they said already shipped but their web said not shipped. Anyway, maybe I got a lemon. Hopefully not."
3,Okay if you like this style,"It's okay, but after awhile ALL his music sounds the same...and I mean they ALL sound the same, so don't bother buying anymore after this one!"
5,Fantastic!,"This book was fantastic! I love Pride and Samantha. Pride finishs his wonderful 3 year-old racing career and Ashleigh and Samantha can't wait for his 4 year-old season. But, when Samantha and Tor come back from a dance and go check on Pride he is laying down and wildly thrashing his legs. Read the book to find out what happens."
5,The Best Book in the Series,"This book was sooooo good!I loved the bond that Samantha and Pride had.They really cared for each other.I cried when Pride got sick.I thought he might not make it.I love everything about this series except for Cindy.Cindy was the downfall of the series.But still I loved this book.The only thing I have to complain about is that on page 93,they said Blues King was a gelding.Yet in the books later on(book #25 page 72 for example)they say he is a stallion.Other than that,this book was great."
2,Can't stand on it's own...,This book simply can't stand on it's own as a text. A textbook should supplement the lectures of a course with further explanations and examples. This book essentially echoes exactly what you would expect in a lecture. This leaves the student hanging in the breeze when it comes to further understanding the material. Recommended as a supplement to another text on the subject but not as a sole source of learning.
4,great ugly music,"raw rock and roll, mistakes and out of key singing included. It reminds me of a messy version of the makers or something like that. a great album for sure."
4,Not a Bad Compilation,"Hey with so many classic blues tunes to choose for a collection like this there are bound to be disagreements over what was and was not included. Overall I would say Time Life did a decent job of pulling together 20 solid tunes that are representative of classic blues. Some are well known, The Thrill Is Gone, Kansas City,,,others maybe less well known. I have many of these cuts on other cd's and tapes but this is great for just sampling some good blues from a variety of artists. For someone who is just getting into this style of music it would serve as a great intro. For me, I listen to it occasionally while I work out. If I'm in the mood for the blues this cd does the trick."
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"After reading the editorial review, I thought I was about to read the greatest epic since War & Peace. Boy was I in for a shock! I found the tone of the book heavy-handed, arrogant, condescending, and puerile. I teach a sixth grade class and I have students with learning disabilities that can write better than this. The characters have about as much depth as a mud-puddles and the plot has suffers from an equal paucity of skill. I found the specious worldview implied therein to be the same rehashed tripe that Ayn Rand spewed out 50 years ago.Furthermore the writing style is the most ponderous I've ever read in a novel, and I've read some bad ones! I don't mind reading things that are didactic and acerbic like the writings of H.L. Mencken...as long as the author has the knowledge and acumen to back it up. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
3,good but,it seems to be a bit of a concept album. with each song flowing into the next. that was cool. the music is mostly instrumental which is good because i dont care for the vocals these guys do. that song baby gall has funny lyrics. i guess i need more structure and consistancy.not as bad as that 2003 album which is wierd.
5,Smitten Once Bitten,"Cerberus Shoal, of late, has been producing SOCIAL SATIRE of the highest order!""Bastion of Itchy Preeves"" has great, smooth, groovey sound and hypnobite!Troglodytes and narcissists of tender foot beware!"
4,solidly entertaining,"i liked both of the man characters. story was entertaining, too... get tired of governmental bad guys acting stupidly (cliched and overused). parts i skipped over as the differences between the two species was a little too freaky...but overall an excellent read."
4,Interesting,I enjoyed the story. The punishment she received for running away would make the best of us runaway at least monthly. Good story I would recommend this book.
4,Re-readable,"I really liked this novel! I fell in love with Lucien the moment he was introduced into the story, and though Tessa is mean to him--- it's justified! It's great to finally read about a heroine who didn't instantly fall in love with her captor, and want to get married and have children before you're even half way through the book. I do however wish the ending was extended a bit... You get the 'happily ever after' but it came and went so quickly that it was kinda disappointing. Reminded me of ""Demon's Captive"". This is something I'd actually re-read!"
4,Other Books,"A big purple monster type guy protects a girl that is trying to help others. A nasty bad guy and his hordes of creepy little black chomping demon type things try and get to her.That is, if most of this isn't just some demented dream or other. Entertaining, but maybe a little wayward."
5,Great listening in the Stu Hamm & Joe Satriani vein,"I was very surprised to see a muso album like this being promoted in the ""Hear It Now"" listening kiosks at Tower Records when it came out. But it's wicked stuff - the shortest review would be to say that if you liked Stu Hamm's ""Kings Of Sleep"", you'll like this. No matter how you slice it, it's like an early Stu Hamm instrumental album (which itself is like a bass-centric Joe Satriani album.) Great melodies, chops a plenty, and no filler - you could throw this in a CD player at a garden party without fear, educating the musical IQ of your audience all the while."
3,Love Lt. Dante -- Disappointed with Hit and Run,"I've read all of Newman's Dante series and have been disappointed with the last two outings. They don't seem to have the energy that the Midtown or Precinct titles did. I'd say this is a better than average book,the characters are compelling, but it is less than Newman is capable of."
2,Roots of Van Morrison,I did not like this CD. I thought that this would be Van Morrison singing but it was various other artists singing. Not happy with it at all!!!!
1,Missing Parts,The description sheet that was included in the plastic bag with the tubing listed some parts that were alleged to be included. They were not. There was only the tubing. I wrote to GE but did not receive a reply.Update: I received a reply from jascoproducts.com. They said I should return the product to Amazon (rather then them sending me the missing parts).
2,"Tradesman 4,5,6","Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money."
4,Not as good,"This book is good but alas not as good as the first. The main reason is the fact that there are no ""WANGISMS"" without them it sounds like Lo Wng is two different people in each book"
3,Not as Good,I thought this book was okay but noot as good as the first because ther was not as much action as the first. But the ending battle with Dr. Exo was pretty good and detailed.
5,Racheael Ray 10-piece cookware,"I had my heart set on the orange set for my wedding shower, but no one could find them so I settled for blue. It has been 2 years and I have thoroughly enjoyed these pans. I like the see through lids (except when I am trying to dry them, there is always a drop of water rolling around the inside rim) and the non-stick surface. I have dry fried eggs and they wipe clean no problem. The variety of sizes is nice, although two of the lids are the same size, so I would have liked a smaller saucepan or the bigger, oblong pan maybe as the tenth piece. Definitely a nice set for the money and any level of cook."
1,Not a very good product,"We bought this based off of what a friend said about the product. When they arrived they were extremely small, warped, and unusable. i would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Can't Stand Rachael Ray,"...but I overcame my feelings because the reviews were great, the set was inexpensive, and I love cobalt blue. The set is very pretty, which is what I was looking for to replace a set of pots and pans that had not aged gracefully. Didn't need something fabulous, since I already have a collection of individual Calphalon, Le Creuset, etc. The pieces are rather small, not in any way generously sized, and the saucepans are designed so that they are wider at the base than the top, which I guess she thought was cute, but really isn't practical. If you need to saute more than two or three servings, you'll need to buy something else to make your famous pasta sauce for your friends. The glass lids and silicone handles are very nice, and the enamel finish cleans easily, but, honestly, I would have returned it if I weren't lazy."
1,Very poor quality expected more from Rachael Ray,"So very disappointed with this product. Enamel is chipping off after 2 months and one of the sauce pans it so warped that the lid will not go on. We have used and cleaned them per the manufacturer. I strongly recommend not spending your money on these. We have other Rachael Ray products that we love, this on is a fail."
5,These were exactly what I had been looking for.,"I've been looking for a long time for just the right pots and pan set. I wanted a fun color and all the right sizes I needed. When I saw these I fell in love. They were the right sizes. (only missing one that I needed, which I bought seperatly.) The color was true to the pictures. The only bummer is that most pots and pans are not dishwasher safe and these are no exception. :( I've had them for probably a month and I love them and the splash of color they bring to my kitchen."
1,Lasted about 6 months which is still 3 months more than IKEA,"I was really tired of using TFAL, Cuisinart & IKEA non stick cookware. These usually last about 3 months (and lose shape as well). Rachael Ray products are better (they haven;t lost shape yet) but they have lost their ability to be non stick ( bought it Christmas 2009). FYI we use it everyday for which it did pretty well. I plan to try calphalon next to see if that does better in terms of daily use. I would suggest buying Rachael Ray porcelain enamel non sticks mostly for their color and style. If you plan on daily cooking, try something else. Good luck & happy hunting!"
2,"Pretty, but has functional flaws","I loved this set, but after I started using it everyday, I realized that the design just isn't very functional and practical. Cooking oil stains the bottom of the pan-- I've been soaking the same pan in dishsoap for 2 days, scrubbing and everything. There are two circular metal pieces that attach the handle to the cooking surface; these metal pieces face the cooking surface as well, getting gunk stuck in their rivets. It's a hassle and chore every time I wash to get it clean. I'm also expecting these areas to rust ~1 year. Not to mention that the handle is shaped in a strange angle-- it puts the load on the upper area of your lower arm, instead of your stronger wrist area, making it clumsy and difficult to lift your pan with food in it. Also, if you heat this above medium heat, the pan turns an icky brown-yellow color, and returns to green as it cools agan. Blech. I've learned my lesson-- skip the pretty and invest in real cooking tools next time."
2,Seems to have Timed-Out,"Loved this set when we first got it less than 2 years ago. Wore out the little saute pan, so replaced it. But now, all of a sudden all of the pans are peeling. Even the ones we don't use much. Paid much more than they are selling for now, altho we did get a $30 rebate (after about 4 months). It was great that they weren't too heavy and a nice cheery yellow. Anyway, I am looking for a replacement for the whole set, but I don't trust the RR brand anymore."
4,RACHAEL RAY PORCELAIN ENAMEL COOKWARE - GREEN,This is my second set of Rachael Ray pans - I love love love them - the first set is still being used but is showing alot of wear. It is about 5 years old. These pans are perfect for me because they are reasonibly priced and I can replace or add to any time. They cook evenly and clean up is a breeze. Highly recommend ! Only gave it 4 stars because no one is perfect.
2,not happy with this,we bought these pots in 2009 an when we got them they were really good pots but after a few months of having them we noticed the pots are Not round like they should be an do not sit on stove like they should (we never put them in dish washer ) an the black on the pots are peeling so you cant use them unless you want the black from the pots in your food very unhappy with these pots
2,NOT WORTH IT,Love the color but the quality is very thin. Ive had 2 pans fall on the floor and both have huge dents and i receiced 1 pan that was already warped. :(
3,Yellow Rachael Ray Cookware Set,"I have had this set of cookware since November last year.....4 months. Although I like cooking in it and the cleanup is easy, I find that the enamel is starting to discolor. There are dark spots on the bottoms and sides. I have tried to clean with soap and a brush, but was unsuccessful. I am a little disappointed since I bought the yellow to go with my kitchen. If I had known this discoloration problem beforehand, I would have bought them in black.Rachael Ray Porcelain Enamel Nonstick 10-Piece Cookware Set, Yellow"
2,black marks ruin pots,I also have the yellow ones for a few weeks now and the black burn marks on bottom of pots cannot come off either! thinking of returning them ;( its a shame because the inside cooks well. any cleaning suggestions? The whole reason I bought them was for beauty and use and now they are ugly in just weeks!!!!
3,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE!!!,"I recieved this set for Christmas last year. I love love loved it....but the blue color has faded and dulled with dishwasher washing. I don't believe that it should say they are dishwasher safe. I hand washed them for a little while but grew tired and resigned to dishwashing them. Going with the annonized set might be better option..even though it isn't as pretty. Set works pretty well, but not very nonstick."
4,RR OFFERS GREAT COLORS,"GREAT COOKWARE...BEAUTIFUL COLOR AND I LOVE THE DEPTH OF THE POTS. THE ONLY THINK I AM NOT PLEASED W/IS THAT THE COOKWARE IS ALREADY TURNING A LITTLE BLACK ON THE BOTTOM AND WE HAVE ONLY USED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES. ALSO, THEY CANNOT GO IN THE DISHWASHER WHICH IS ANOTHER CON. OTHER THAN THAT, GOOD ITEM."
1,Color comes off,"I purchased the Orange set, and after a short time, the orange color came off as a powder. My stove would be orange, my counter,my cabinet, my dishwahser, my sink...my hands. A complete mess as it left residue on anything it touched. I ended up having to through these away as I was affraid about something toxic getting in our food.. not to mention the constant mess. What a waste of a lot of money. DO NOT BUY THESE!"
3,Good for a short time,"I bought this set when I bought a house. I had no pots or dishes, so getting an affordable set was important. These started out well, but very soon into having them the bottoms were scorched from the flames of my gas stove. I bought these a year and a half ago and the blue has faded and is splotched with black marks from the flames.Outside of the looks of these they are pretty good, but if I could do it over again I would have bought this set: [...]. Sure, they are way more expensive, but you will not need to buy new pots and pans for YEARS. If you really need to stock up your kitchen the RR brand things are the way to go, but she has a different line that is better here: [...]. The orange is not my favorite, but the quality is slightly better and the color is less likely to fade."
4,Great cookware for daily use,I had been wanting this set for a long time. I really like it a lot as it is easy to use and clean up is a breeze. My only complaint would be that the saute pan is too small at 10 inches. You can't beat the price though and the color is really pretty and different. The glass lids are wonderful! You will not be disappointed in this set.
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT,Rachel Ray has created wonderful cookware! Not only are they attractive but they are also wonderful to use! Easy to clean too!
5,Love Them,I ordered this set in green about 6 months ago and am very pleased in my investment. They cook evenly and I can't believe how easy they are to clean. They also arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.
2,Beware: Not dishwasher safe,"THE 2-STAR RATING APPLIES TO THE ORANGE PORCELAIN ENAMEL SET ONLY.I bought the porcelain enamel set in orange. Loved the color. After 3 or 4 times through the dishwasher, however, the color faded immensely! They are now not even close to the original color. I then ordered the Hard Anondized set and now just use the orange set when I need extra pots. I am very pleased with the H.A. set and would give it a 4-star rating. I do like the silicone rubber handles on both sets; and the lids are nicely configured. I wish the set came with 1 qt, 2 qt, and 3 qt saucepans, though. This set only has 1-1/2 qt and 3 qt saucepans; I find that I really miss the in-between size."
3,Okay for a budget but won't last very long,"Received this as a wedding present. Not very heavy but cooks fairly evenly. Got it in 2005 and had to replace one of the frying pans in 2010 because the non-stick wore through (to be fair we should have replaced it a year earlier but didn't get to it). Non-stick is now wearing out on the others. Pans also dent easily. We are now replacing it piece by piece with stainless steel and higher grade stainless steel, particularly the Anolon Advanced. It is a good little set for the money but just keep in mind that it won't last for more than a few years and you will eat some non-stick from time to time."
2,Glass lid shattered,I have the orange set. The glass lid shattered while I was simmering rice on low! That shouldn't happen.
2,"I love the color, but the quality is poor","I bought this set for the color. great color, but not sturdy. the bottom discolors as soon as you use it. I still have some of the pieces, but threw away the frying pan."
4,Like them for the most part,"I was very excited to recieve the set. This set is hand washed as recommended but within the first month the blue enamel started faded in many different places on the set. The lids are a poor design, it does not allow water to empty completely which quickly causes rusting. Any little bump causes set to dent. I'm not sure if I would purchase Rachel Ray again."
1,Teflon came right off,"I was excited to buy these after owning two casserole dishes from the product line that are great. Unfortunately, after one wash the teflon peeled straight off. Looking for a customer service number in the documents included in the packaging proved impossible and finding on on the website was equally impossible. I expected more, frankly. I was lucky that I'd kept the receipt and they went straight back to the store. Purchased a KitcheWare brand set to replace them and haven't had a problem since.There are always cases of defective products, and I was unfortunate enough to have received one. It turned me off to her cookware products but I've had no problem with the bakeware so I'll continue to use and purchase her bakeware."
5,A breathtaking finale to a wonderful series,I read all seven books in the Incarnations of Immortality series in four days. I couldn't put them down! But 'And Eternity' stood out from a superlative series. A well-crafted story that brings together threads from the previous books in the series and weaves them together to create an ending that Fate herself would be surprised at. A must read for anyone who has ever felt that God is sleeping on the job
2,The absolute worst Incarnation Novel,What are the rest of you on? This was the worst incarnation novel and you're giving it 10s???. The plot was so predictable with Orlene visiting all the other incarnations in turn. And then the only thing Anthony can say about God is that you need some evil in God to make God more compassionate. It is so tired and not anywhere near as good as For Love of Evil (which really added something to the character of Satan). What a complete belly flop of an end to an otherwise excellent series.
5,A very good ending to his Incarnations of Immortality series,"This book was very well written and contains much thought. Orlene, from BEARING AN HOURGLASS, is insearch of her baby Gaw 2. She finds that Nox the incarnation of the night has her baby and that Gaw 2 had a malady that corrupted his soul. Nox told Orlene to get one thing from each of themajor incarnations. an empty soul from death, a grain of sand from time, the seed of war from war, a curse from satan, a tread from fate and a blessing from god. as you read on you discover orlene's conection with all the incarnations. she is war and nature's daughter, time's ex, satan's stepdaughter, fate's granddaughter,and she is god(sorry i spoiled the ending, but too bad, ha, ha, ha!!!!"
1,Morally Repulsive and boring too!!!,"You get all that in one package. Spare yourself, just read the other books in this series. 'On a Pale Horse' is my favorite."
2,And Eternity,"A very unfortunate title to end such a great series. Although I do have to admit it is a page turner, it left me feeling cheated and unhappy. This series is one of my favorite, but it is obvious that (just as he says in the foreward) Piers Anthony did not want to write this book."
2,uncomfortable reading,"I loved books from this author as a child. This series kept me thinking the the author is a bit of a chauvinist and a bit dirty minded. Did I miss that as a child? Are the Xanth and Adept series like that? I may have to re-read them and see. For this book I feel way too much time seemed spent on the sexual situations with a minor. After a while, I just couldn't see past it."
2,This book has it all!,"Subtle racism, a completely predictable ""twist"" ending, and a supposed reconciliation between evolution and creationism that somehow manages to be equally ignorant of, and insulting to, both sides. While it does finally wrap up the plot line established in the other books, it does so with Anthony's typically terrible writing and a plot that is as convoluted and yet as boring as it could possibly be. Someone should write a Cliff Notes version of this book to spare the other poor suckers out there the necessity of having to read through it to obtain some closure."
4,A good conclusion to the series,"Well, folks. I got through the series. Some I liked, some I loved, and one I couldn't stand at all. But this one was in the like category. I thought it was a bit long-winded at times, but overall it was a good read and a worthy conclusion to the IOI series.If you've read the other six, you really should finish it off with this book to see how it all ends."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"God is bloody slack.It appears that the Incarnation of Good is not doing his job properly. When a descendant of one of the other characters in the series finds out her kid is on a trip to Hell, she decides the whole thing is flawed.With a few others, she decides to do something about it.Easily the worst of this series, as the Incarnation basically is non-existent. He also appears to be doing sweet FA, so a movement starts for impeachment to get rid of him."
3,Boring Book with Good Surprise Ending,"A Good Book is ruined by repetition: Having suffered through the repetition of themes in the earler Incarnations books, I was put to sleep halfway in this book. The last chapter was great but does not make up for the worn-out formula writing of the book. Anyone who finds deep religious insight here, is someone beginning to understand that religion is a fantasy believed by adults, and Anthony is a closet athiest. I will take the deified Julie here anyday over the Tyrant of the Old Testament, (who loves sending plagues, etc., and otherwise acting a little like Satan). This book and the series does have a better grasp of virtue than most preachers ever will... If this book makes you think about your religion, thats good! Buy the book!"
1,Not even one star,"I've had a suspicion about Piers Anthony for a while now. Somehow or other in alot of his works he's got an older male character having a sexual attraction or getting sexually involved with a girl of middle teen years. That's the case in this book, and it came up again in his Man(Series where he reincarnates a family throughout human history) Series.I also didn't like the line where he states ""she has just a little bit of the ""negroid"" in her.""Call me prudish, but somebody has to draw the line even on bestsellers."
1,Filled with pedophilia,"I first read this series when I was in junior high and I loved it. I've recommended it many times, but it's been years since I reread the whole thing. So it came as a huge suprise to me that this book makes it seem as though the entire series was merely to promote pedophilia. The entire plot seems to be to put someone into the office of god who doesn't think that having sex with young girls is a sin. Over and over the characters tells us it's okay and how great it is and how if they're ""really in love"" a grown man having sex with a child isn't wrong. Well it is wrong. I'm disgusted that I ever gave this man money. I'm embarressed that I ever recommended these books to anyone. Mostly I'm shocked that any publisher would allow this filth to be published."
2,Kinda boring,"I enjoyed the series as a whole, and even liked Love of Evil, because it was interesting. However, nothing really interesting actually happens in this book. The three main characters walk around, and make observations that God doesn't do anything. Plot-wise, I felt this last book of the series to be a disappointment."
4,Very good if you want to pass the exam.,As with any exam cram book you should complement your preparation with the hands on usage of a real dababase even if its a personal edition. If you practice all terms described in the book you should have no trouble passing the Oracle8i exam.
3,very nice book,there is a lot of picture and designs that help me to develope my understanding how is the rug is done
4,Excellent!,"I was touched by this movie, having a son with dyslexia myself. It is great to see movies from non-mainstream countries, the movie shows very well the everyday life of upper class (and some glimpses of destinies of other classes) in India. I found it at times a bit too ""rosy"" and too predictable, with some over-acting but I guess this is ok if the target public includes children. Too bad the movie isn't available with subtitles or sound track in languages other than English and Hindi so that children not mastering these two languages could also benefit from it."
5,Different version,"This movie is truly heartwarming for all ages, and I think it should be released on Blu-Ray Combo Pack.I though, have the UTV version of the movie (before it released to Disney DVD). When my kids watched it for the first time, they were sad and happy at the right moments. Though, they used the subtitles. Even in UTV version, it has really good quality sound (almost like Dolby Digital 5.1) and good picture quality.Some avaliable features on the disc, is ""Play""; ""Scenes""; a seperate section to listen to the songs: ""Songs""; and ""Subtitles"". The film is only avaliable in widescreen. But, their are points in the film where black spots can be seen, but that cannot take away the film. In some moments subtitles are shown whenever some speaks in english. Three songs, though, cannot use subtitles.I do say, Aamir Khan has a made a Indian success. And Darsheel Safary (Ishaan Awashti) is really good at acting."
3,Entertaining,"I expected a little more in the film. If I saw this on cable first, I would have never purchased it. Not a movie you want to see over and over."
5,Movie was fantastic,"You can read the other reviews to see how great the movie was. I just wanted to clarify one thing:The CD you receive is more of a score instead of a soundtrack. I didn't read the track listing before buying (though it doesn't matter, since I bought it for the movie and the CD was just bonus). So it doesn't have the actual songs I really wanted, like ""Maa"", ""Bum Bum Bole"", ""Mera Jahan"" etc... I found those on iTunes, however. Also, if you search ""taara Zameen Par"" here on Amazon it will pull up two different albums that have the songs on them, though with different names. For example, ""Bum Bum Bole"" is called ""Dekho Dekho"". It's rather confusing.So, the point of this review is so people aren't surprised when they pop in the CD in the CD player and can't find those popular songs, like I was. Either way, hey, free soundtrack with the price of the movie."
5,Excellent!,"As with all the reviewers here, I found this film amazing. Darsheel Safary will steal your heart as Ishaan. It is definitely one of those films where everything comes together. I cannot recommend it highly enough. For those of you concerned about Disney presenting this DVD, don't worry. this DVD is in Hindi and English. However, you do have the choice of an English audio track (songs still in Hindi), and subtitles are available in English, and in English for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. There's also a commentary track by director Aamir Khan, so you have a lot of choices in how you want to watch it. It comes with a special features disc, and the soundtrack. Do yourself a favor and see this film."
4,Great family movie,"This is a great family movie, full of lessons for the parents & about how every child have their own expression & as the parent, we here to guide them to find their strength & happiness."
2,So so for PC users,"I have been trying to follow this book for some time now but all of the little windows shown for how to adjust something are for Mac rather than PC. Not only do they look very different on my PC from the pictures she shows, but the places to find them are also impossible to follow--I cannot find 50% of the command windows she has on her Mac for adjustments. Nearly all of the adjustments are impossible to follow and as a result about half of the book is quite useless for PC users. The other half teaches you methods of painting and drawing, which I suppose are useful if you have never done any drawing or painting on paper. In general, if you are a Mac user, purchase this book for the setup tutorials. If you have a PC, find a different book--which is what I am about to do!"
4,Pretty decent Book,"The book takes an approach through modern or fine art, so if you're one of those ""anime artists/comic book/cartoon pop art"" you'll probably find this book boring. I wanted to mention this because certain types of illustrators and cartoonists want to draw pretty pictures and not understand the basics of producing artwork.Having said that it's actually NOT a blast at the book itself, as an artist that enjoys all types of work, the book is helpful in making me realize how to create strokes and apply it to those types of illustrations I mentioned above. Learning the basics and exercises as such is a GOOD thing.I was originally using an intuos 2 to practice the exercises, and I think now that I upgraded my tablet I'll try again with my intuos 3 and enjoy the exercises more so.Doing the exercises also helps you get used to your tablet and figuring out how you need to adjust your strokes in producing artwork, so it's very much worth the try."
2,Not for the serious artist,"This book has mediocre instruction, and the example art is very very bad. I was very let down by the poor quality of both the instruction and sample art. I would say that both are not quite high school level, so I personally would hesitate to recommend this book to any adult that has any serious interest in art at all. The only difference between this book and a high school level art textbook is that this book also covers very, VERY basic software information you can easily learn from many free sources or through a few hours of tinkering. It would probably be a good gift for a kid or perhaps someone who is undertaking digital art as a very casual hobby. If you are more serious than that about learning digital painting, I would recommend Don Seegmiller's book instead."
1,Beware! Old book for old versions of tablet and software.,"I assumed the book would be kept up to date the same way the author's ""Painter Wow"" books are, but I was wrong. I would not have purchased this book had I known it was 6 years old."
4,Works for me . . .,A very nice place to start if you're trying to expand Photoshop skills into traditional art techniques.
1,Very Boring,"I wanted to learn how to paint digitally, but the book made me lose interest in the subject, I advise you not to buy this book."
2,Book is for painting but not drawing.,This book is good for painting ONLY! If you want to draw on your Wacom tablet in programs such as Corel Draw then do not buy this book. There is no help want so ever on using this book to do vector drawing.
2,Not what I expected or needed,"This book is probably great for a digital artist who plans to use painter for digital art. That is not what I wanted or needed the book for. So I did not finish reading it, but gave it to someone who would."
1,looks nicer than it is.,The directions were skimpy. The pieces did not fit together very well. In trying to fit the leg to one of the arms the groove was too small and it broke. I had to glue it together. The company that distributed this product were very cooperative so I don't fault them. They would have no idea how poorly this product was constructed so I would use them again.
2,Powell Heirloom Cherry Blanket Rack,"I was not very happy with it, not very sturdy. The stickers they put on were hard to get off, they took off some of the finish when I tried to remove them. Had to use alcohol to remove the glue. I would have thought it came from Big lots or someplace like that."
1,what a waste!,"My mom bought one of these for us as a house warming gift because I have some beautiful homemade hand quilted quilts my grandmother made me that are to pretty to keep in a chest. I was so excited to be able to display them on this rack. It was easy to put together, looked great too. After we had it for a few months it began to fall apart! The legs broke one at a time. The slot the legs fit into splintered. I repaired them with wood glue and clamps and they rebroke in different places a few weeks later! What a rip! It looks great, but poorly designed. I would not recommend anyone purchasing this. It might make good firewood but this is an awful quilt rack."
1,waste of money,"The blanket rack arrived today. My husband put it together. What a piece of junk. It is not sturdy at all, the legs are not straight, and the middle screw down knobs don't even screw all the way down. I put my blankets on it and heard the wood sounding like it was splitting. I would not recommend this rack."
2,Less than desirable,This is a very flimsy piece of furniture. Finish is just OK and assymbly was easy. Not strong enough to hold much weight at all.
2,Cheap,"I bought this rack to hang my Amish Quilts on.PROS: Arrived in perfect condition. Box was boxed in Amazon packaging to prevent damage. Only took me a few minutes to put together.CONS: Cheap. This rack sits in my hallway, when I moved the rack to mop I noticed the legs were broke. Apparently, the wood is very soft and splits with little effort.My advice is that if you do decided to purchase this rack, upon putting it together, Gorilla Glue everything!"
4,blanket rack,"This rack was easy to put together and holds several quilts,I'm happy to have my quilts on display.Wood is a nice dark shade."
2,Legs broke during assembly,I used gorilla glue and got it put together 'good enough' but I can't recommend this. Pretty cheap - but the wood is pretty
2,Inferior wood,I was very disappointed as we were trying to assemble this blanket rack. The bottom pieces slide into a groove and when we attempted to do this the wood cracked. I am sending it back as I write this review. Hopefully I can get a replacement that is of better quality.
1,ABSOLUTE JUNK!,"I would not even give this product a star, but you have to give it at least one. I had the product less than a week and it already fell apart. The legs broke off where they connect to main frame. I do not know what kind of wood they used, but balsa wood is stronger. I would not recommend anyone buy this product, it is absolute junk and a waste of money. I should have took the advice of the other comment that called this product junk, but bought it because my wife wanted it."
2,Not worth the price.,"This dvd is just not worth the price. It should only cost five dollars or so. It's got some hard to find matches but it's bascially a very unprofessional dvd. Some matches look like they were recorded with home video cameras. Also the menus are really bad, even for a low budget dvd. I consider my self a pretty hardcore wrestling fan and I buy alot of hard to find or rare wrestling dvd's but this is just now worth your time."
1,Horrible CD,"I grew up with Screw. I was there in the neighborhood from the beginning. I still have over 50 grey tapes. This CD is nothing but grey tapes put on CD in a completely differernt order than they were originally in. The sound quality is POOR. It sounds like someone played the grey tapes as loud as possible and recorded onto the computer and sold them the next day. If you have grey tapes, you don't need this CD bc you already have all the music in its original form. If you don't have grey tapes, get grey tapes (or grey tapes on CD), but don't waste your money on this CD. It gets 1 star only bc that's the lowest I can give it. It deserves a ZERO."
5,The Mountain DVD,"This is a great movie. If you do not know about it, run over to IMDB.com and check it out. My copy was made by Olive Studios and in my opinion it is excellent especially considering the age of the film. The colors were bright and clear with little or no fading. The audio was clear. I paid more money for this transfer than for a cheap overseas import of dubious quality. I am very pleased with this copy of this movie. Some folks have noted the apparent age difference between the two brothers. I dont find this to be much of a problem; I am 63 and my youngest sibling is 46.Now that I have bought this DVD I have found a copy on eBay in Blu-ray. If I can find a good transfer, I will have to get it and give this DVD to a family member. Hope this helps."
1,Blu-ray has no English subtitles/closed captions!,"(5/4/12, 1 star for this Olive Films release, 4 stars for the movie) The Blu-ray version is an excellent print of a movie that I've always enjoyed, but incomprehensibly, the studio opted not to bother with subtitles/closed captions. Whether this omission is the result of the studio's misguided notions of economy or sheer callousness, I wouldn't know. I do know that there are countless cinephiles who will pass on this movie, because they have less than perfect hearing, or they are non-native English speakers who need subtitles to fully understand the dialog, or because, like me, they like to watch movies at low volume with the subtitles turned on. Anyway, my comments are meant for the sizable segment of the home video market who resent it when studios ignore their wishes."
5,Great movie,"Enjoyable to watch. A story showing the character of a brother who remains consistent in his moral values in spite of being misunderstood and mistreated by a younger brother he raised. A good view of what the world was like, technically and personally, during that time period."
3,liked it,only thing i did not like about the watch was that it screems out put a metal band on me and they put a cheap leather one on it.but it's still a pretty nice watch
4,Hello Kitty Backpack,"I got this for my 5 year daughter old for Christmas. She played with it most all day Christmas and then loaded it up with toys for her trip to see her granny the next day. She seems very pleased with it so far. It's fairly durable, and I hope it lasts for at least a year. It's colorful, and though not very large, it will still hold quite a bunch of stuff! She was complaining this evening that it was too heavy! (She had really packed it with very important items!) I sort of winced at paying $15.00 for it, but I guess it's worth it. I wouldn't want to pay any more for it.And the shipping was extremely fast and the backpack was well packaged."
2,Mouse is not at the same height. This is definitely a problem.,I have a similar piece from fellowes unfortunately the mouse is bit lower than keyboard. I have carpal tunel syndrome problem and thats the whole reason I bought this.My Doctor advised to have the keyboard and mouse height should be exactly at the elbow. That is forehand and hand should make a right angle at the elbow. People do use mouse a lot now a days and this design doesn't help. I don't have anything against it but this is just a point to be pondered before purchasing this.
3,Nice accessory but poor sound quality,"I got the in-car kit that interfaces with the cassette player. The antenna and mounting brackets are top quality and I get good reception everywhere. But the sound quality delivered through the cassete adapter is flat. It doesn't even sound like 2 channel stereo, more like mono. The accessory manual even mentions that sound quality with the cassette was not as good as headphones as did another review I read online. Its disappointing. Amazon, as always, was convenient fair priced and shipped fast."
4,Does the job,"My husband installed, and was not an ""easy"" job. Sound quality of FM transmitter not that great, but casette connection better."
4,Nice but not as good as Delphi car kit,The Inno is by far a superior product to the Delphi XM 2 Go unit. There is one drawback to this unit. You cannot play it on the car radio unless you have the car kit whereas you can play the Delphi without the kit.
3,"Umm, it is so great?","Well, seeing how I was kinda forced to buy this freakin 70$ item in order to enjoy my Inno in my car, all I can comment on is how good it is, which I will say is satisfactory.Thanks Pioneer for packaging up alot of crap I didn't need like another remote and jacking the price up.The cradle is adequete and holds the Inno like a new born child. The wires are really fantastic, they are black and rubbery and carry a signal to the unit. The power cord does a magnificent job of supplying electricity to the unit. I especially love the remote..er..remotes I have.Umm...yeah."
4,Fub but hard in the end,Okay my friend and i spent a long time following foals and then we got to the secret garden trail. We expected it to be something way sifferent but anyway. when we got to a certain part of the trail we got hoplessly lost in a maze. If you are good with mazes play the end if you're not I hope you like oblivian
5,Barbie Horse Adventures: Wild Horse Rescue,The game is fun and I enjoy it. Does tend to hang on the one level but overall a fun game.
3,I hate it ;my daughter loves it!,"I bought this game for my 3 year old daughter, she loves it. Once she figured out how to use some of the controls and actually interact with the game it was hard to get her to stop playing it.The big problem is that she still can't control the entire game, so she needs you to sit with her. She is about 1 year to young for this game. This forces you to sit through Barbie for long periods of time! The other problem is that when she is playing; I can't play any of my other games. Consider buying a seperate system if you love playing games and are giving this to your daughter.I'm glad I got the game because she loves it and will play for very long periods of time. What girl doesn't love barbie, horse and new clothes? All three are part of the game. I would never buy this game for a boy.I imagine she'll be playing this for a few years since she enjoys it so much."
2,disn't work,my litter sister didn't get a chance to play this game because it didn't work when i bought it from this dealer.
2,It's a snooze fest.,"It's not fun at all. I'm 7 years old, Believe me all you do is ride around on a horse and jump over stuff. I mean really what's fun about that?"
3,gentle fun,"My granddaughter and I both love playing this game. I bought her one last year and we play it so much I bought one to keep at my house so we can both play it here also. You can change Barbies and her steeds appearance. Play several fun games that vary from races against the clock to races against other riders. I love exploring all the different terrain, my favorite is the beach. There are a few scary momments with bears, moose and even bunnies, but the challenges are fun. Collecting coins, treasure chest and other goodies along the way adds reward, finding the foals and returning them safe makes you feel good and catching the wild horses is a great adventure. I recommend this game for good gentle fun."
2,"If you want a cute game for girls, get Mario Kart, not this","The title says it all. Obviously, this game was made for little girls, but there's better games out there that might appeal to girls without insulting their intelligence.I'm actually exaggerating a bit, this game is not nearly as bad as it could have been. Most of the gameplay is built on riding your horse, which borrows a lot from the Zelda 64 riding engine. Once you get off your horse though to look for runaway horses, watch out. Barbie is slow on her feet and can't run, which can get very annoying. There are also side activities, like unlocking outfits and washing your horse, which is as rudimentary as using the cursor brush to move over a horse.But overall this game sucks. If you want to buy a game for your sister/daughter/niece, get her a real game with quality gameplay, like Mario Kart: Double Dash or Super Monkey Ball."
5,Wow!,"I bought this because i love horses, but i hate barbie. I wasnt exepecting alot, but i really love the game!!!! Barbie walks really slow, and she gets a little annoying (I turn it down on my TV though!) but the game is totally awesome!"
5,What's the big deal?,"Really, i don't see why everyone is embarrased about this game. i'm a teen myself and yet, i still love any games that have to do w/ horse riding and even if Barbie is in it, i'll still play it. it should'nt matter on what character you play (in this case Barbie) but just as long as you have fun playing the game. personally, i have to give credit to all those people who are not embarrased to play this game. so really, what is the big deal? i admited that i liked it."
1,Not worth the money...,"Advice in this book is trivial (like: learn English, study in US if possible to have local education, make friends once in the US) and to some extent outdated - author arrived to the US in the early 70-ties as did most of people she talked with."
5,Excellent resource for all visitors to America,"Well I must say after all your hard work Letty you have produced a fantastic book. A fabulous resource for all kinds of people. I wish I could have seen this book when I first came here to these United States back in 1976. I am passing this on to all I know to read and enjoy and to be sure they will benefit from reading this book. Thanks so much for letting me a part of your Succeeding in America!Best wishes, Lina"
3,Anda becomes roadkill,"Anda was flagging badly at this point in his career and here his gasping, diminished remains were extinguished by the greatness of Karajan. The Santa Fe Listener is right.Karajan unleashes the BPO for awesome glory and the result is the best orchestral performance of the Brahms 2nd I've ever heard, surpassing Furtwangler. Get the disc for Karajan. I recently underhanded Karajan in a review of Furtwangler's Beethoven. After listening to this recording and Karajan's 1963 Brahms 1st, I'm wondering again--who was greater?"
4,Such a poor choice for a title,"One doesn't have to be a Masoist to be able to read and enjoy this book, but one must be able to tolerate an intense degree of repetition. Her other books such as ""The American Woman in the Chinese Hat"" or ""Art Lover"" are more accessible, if you consider her writing accessible at all or too accessible. I happen to find her literary style easily approachable.Defiance is high-strung in content and style. Like gripping a viola too tightly around its neck for 19 hours straight on the edge of a precipice. I imagined it must have been quite a challenge and a feat for Maso to write this book and a challenge for readers to consume."
2,Embarassingly self-inflated,The author is known for putting down other writers and positioning herself as the great genius. Hence a novel about a great woman genius. The idea of a teacher driven to kill her students makes sense but all the book harps on is how brilliant the protagonist/author is.
5,Murray Cook uses DiMarzio,I attached a black strap to a Paper Jamz guitar to complete my Murray Cook (The Wiggles) costume. This is one sturdy strap; I bought it for novelty but it will obviously handle the real instruments and the clip makes for easy-on/easy-off. Made in USA.
4,Best yet,"This is the most comfortable/durable strap and strap lock I have used yet, and great price! So it's definitely worth it"
3,"Good for fans, okay for other readers of the genre","This is a reprint of two of Nora Roberts' earlier works, and it shows in the writing. Not that it's bad - fans will definitely recognize her style and ""opposite attract"" formula - but both lack the polish and humor of her later works. I agree with other reviewers who found the heroines annoying, but that's somewhat typical of the genre, too. Good for passing time in the airport, anyway..."
1,As bad as a TV sitcom,"These skits bring the cruelest, worst elements of TV sitcoms into children's theater. In a recent performance, I watched as my daughter and her classmates played brothers and sisters who tear each other down with cutting remarks, friends who squabble about who is best in something, girls in cliques who ditch a misfit, and girls who get into a little female bonding by heaping ridicule on their (offstage and unseen) younger brothers. There is also the memorable line, uttered by my daughter during her skit, that ""boys are creeps"".The more audiences and parents watch this stuff, the more pronounced its effect will be -- like the negative effect, discussed by Robert Bly in his book Iron John, that Norman Lear's father-bashing sitcoms have had on fathers in this country. We need to learn, and teach, respect for others."
2,Not good,"This product is not adequate for hunting situations. I used it for hunting season last fall and due to it's poor quality, I almost missed the buck of my life. I ended up shooting off hand and took the buck home after the pod bent with the pressure from my rifle which weighed only 10 pounds loaded. Other than the poor quality it is not a great idea for hunting because it is too short to use in even a sitting situation since it must be fully extended for such a shot. Fully extended is where the problems show up, it is wobbly and unstable. Then again, it costs just under $15 bucks so what did I expect?"
5,Great for music in a Honda Civic with card-slot behind nav unit,The gf has an '08 Honda Civic with a card slot beside the CD slot. I bought this compact flash card along with the following SanDisk Compact Flash (CF) to PC Card adapter:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B9QD/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_imgI use a universal card reader that came with my digital camera to load mp3s onto the CF card shown in the link.It works great. The touch screen on the car's dashboard allows us to browse folders and sub-folders. The card holds thousands of songs. We have lots of our favorite music in the dashboard of the car now.
3,It took a month to get my memory card!,"The product was completely fine except that the box was smushed from being sent to Timbuktu and back. I ordered the memory card right after black Friday and I was lucky I got the thing before Christmas. I live in NY they sent my card from a city 45 min. away to Cincinnati, OH. Then they sent it to Pennsylvania. After nearly a month I got my card. I'm never buying from them again."
4,"It's good, but now that the Extreme IV prices are coming down...","It's good, but now that the Extreme IV prices are coming down I would buy that instead."
4,"Works, as advertised","Card works quite well with my 10 megapixel digital SLR. Keeps up nicely when shooting in burst mode, and I have never had any problems with losing data with any of the SanDisk cards I've owned (1,2,4 GB inclusive). Recommended."
4,Noticably slower than Extreme IV with Canon 30D,"I did not perform measurements but in highspeed mode, it was much slower (5-10 seconds slower) than the extreme IV. I also notice the delay after capture of continuous shooting before the pictured display on LCD. I am using this on Canon 30D.No complaints on quality, always had good results with Sandisk."
5,Great Product! Great Service!,Amazon not only provided me with a great product (super fast and reliable equipment) but also with great customer service when there was a slight problem with my order.
5,"Best yet, no complaints, extremely fast write time","I am using this with my Canon Rebel XTi. I previously used a Sandisk Ultra II 2GB. I used to have trouble snapping a bunch of pics in a row. My camera would display ""busy"". I asked a local camera shop and the woman recommend an Extreme III card. I purchased this 4GB Extreme III card and it made all the difference. I can take endless shots in a row as fast as I can possibly take them and it never stops or displays busy. I now know for certain that it was my old card and not my camera. The price is right and makes taking pictures so much easier and enjoyable. I gave it 5 stars because I have no complaints. If you want extremely fast write times, I highly recommend getting this card."
5,Reliable and dependable,"These folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory, and Amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it's like money in the bank. I hope no one comes in and tries to ""improve"" things."
4,SanDisk Extreme III 4GB,"Excellent product, maybe a little slow if you are shooting a lot of imagesin rapid sequence but it catches up in a matter of seconds. With the currentSanDisk rebate stock up-realizing all the while, that in the near future 4GB cards will seem like a joke as the sizes jump to 20-40GB."
5,great memory card,I didn't think the memory card would have much to do with taking pictures but after seeing how fast pictures are written to the card i realized the advantage of this card. It was a little pricier than i expected to pay for 4 gb but i think in the end the speed makes up for the price. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a memory card.The only downside is that my Olympus SLR will not let me take panorama pictures with this type of card so i'll have to get XD (i think).
5,I'm impressed.,"I bought this item to replace one of my Hitachi 4GB MicroDrive cards that bit the dust. It writes and downloads FASTER than the MicroDrive, and has the benefit of having no moving parts and hence, more reliability."
1,NIKON D200 users beware!!!!,"There seems to be a problem between this card manufacturer and Nikon D200. Apparently, the pins do not properly line up and could possibily cause MAJOR damage to your camera. The Nikon D200 is so finely tuned making it very sensitive to anything less than exact. High standards for our Nikon babies (D200) which is what I expect from of a Nikon!!!! Try the Kingston brand of this speed card. So far, so good!"
2,SanDisk SDCFxs CFC,"Please be advised that this Sandisk 4 GB part number SDCFX3-4096-901 did not work in my Canon XT SRL camera. i did contact SanDsik, they said you have to formate this card to make it work...It was too late i had already sent it back, very upset over thsi chain of events.. Both another 4GB memor card, inserted into my Canon XT SLR and works great.."
3,Avoid if you have original Digital Rebel,"Avoid this card if you have the original model of the Canon Digital Rebel. I purchased the card and the write speed is no faster than on my sandisk Ultra II card. Of course, had I done proper research, I would have known that the write speed of the camera itself is limited, and no matter how fast the card is, it will still write at a slower speed.If you have a newer model Canon EOS then im sure it will be faster."
5,Great CF Cards,"As a professional wedding and family photographer, these are the only cards I use. I love 'em! They're super fast! Unless you need these faster cards, you don't need to spend this much on cards. You can see the images I capture with these cards [...]."
4,Great performer,"I use it for both, file storage and dSLR camera medium. It's fast and so far reliable (6 months). I give it 4 stars instead of 5 just beacuse I think the price difference between this one and Ultra II is not justified.So Ultra II is great, Extreme III is better, but not that much."
5,One Happy Customer!,"Today I attended a birthday party and took about a hundred pictures - I could have taken almost 4,000 with my new SanDisk SDCFX3-004G-A31 4 GB Extreme III CompactFlash Card. Taken with a Canon Power Shot S419 (not a high end camera by any measure), I had 100% super fine shots. The product and provider get an A+ rating."
1,Avoid the seller 'Cambridgeworld' !!!!,"I ordered three of this item. They sent all fake ones. The cards do not have serial number anywhere and they are not working. I formatted them and did everything but still not working. The enclosed CD also does not have serial number. I talked to SANDISK costomer service. I sent photo of this cards and boxes. SANDISK sent a letter confirmed that these cards are not authentic.Hey Cambridgeworld, Stop ripping off customers!!!"
3,okay,Seems that it goes a little slow after taking a few pictures. It is not lightning fast in my sony A300.
4,a little slow,Received this item after about a week - no updates were given for the tracking so I wasn't sure when it was coming. Received in good condition though.
2,Defective product,"I ordered this product and put it in my Nikon D200. The product was improperly manufactured, and caused the pins in my camera to bend, rendering it inoperable. I had no idea what the cause was, and went to my camera store, and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well.We took a quick look at the card, and the holes were obviously improperly aligned. The damage to the cameras was repairable, and the replacement card I received worked ok, but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment."
1,jawbreakers,like so this one time i totally tried to eat one of these deals whole and it totally almost broke my jaw. I was not expecting this due to the fact that i thought it was bubble gum. It hurt. My feelings (and mouth).
1,where's the sweet?,These things have about as much flavor as unsweetened candy. I'd have to agree with the other negative review that they are pretty tasteless. I recall these being much better as a kid..
3,"Great history, so-so recipes","This book provides a lot of information and baking history which makes for an interesting read. However, the few recipes I tried making (silver cake, chewy butterscotch bars, cheesecake) were just OK. They got eaten but no rave reviews. I would still recommend this book if you want a wide variety of recipes and have an interest in the origins of american favorites such as pound cake. This book also contains several Pillsbuty Bake Off winners as they are a part of our history."
2,Whose America? Not Mine.,"The author does have SOME good recipes, but not that many by far. As a rule of thumb, I borrow a cookbook from the local library; if I like it, I buy it. I'm not buying this one. He likes to use a lot of parsimmons, which, hey, how many of us really do? He doesn't give you a warm and fuzzy feeling reading his book, either. He's kinda bossy/preachy, which I did not care for. There are better baking authors out there that I urge you to try. Don't be fooled by the title of this book. He starts off with some history, and then BOOM, he just starts adding in recipes that many of us have never heard of. Don't buy it before trying it out. Also, read the other reviews very closely to see how many of them really tried the recipes before reviewing this book. Good luck on your decision."
1,Infocus SP lamp - 006 Counterfeit,"This unit sold as OEM, but reality was not. Good copy but after 20 hours of use replace lamp message on screen and Infocus' procedure / support to correct ineffective assume due to copy status. Now either live with or replace with true OEM."
3,Small,I got this for my brother and thought it would be bigger than this. It's for a boy but I'm not sure if it's as masculine as I'd have liked.
2,Disappointing Gene,"Being a big Gene Pitney fan, and not having heard of ""The Bronze Sessions"" before, I was looking forward to something very special.Bronze indeed. They wouldn't dare have labeled this Gold or even Silver. How about ""white metal sessions""? Unfortunately, there was a reason I'd not heard of it. These are mostly mediocre recordings without the punch of most other Gene Pitney songs. Wimpy arrangements engulf the sound here without the benefit of the lush orchestrations and emotion that are generally present for Gene. I listened to it once and then filed it away probably never to be heard again. If you MUST have this CD to fill out a collection, by all means order it. Otherwise, I would fast forward to something by this artist that you really want."
4,LACKING INFORMATION,"Although I know the Lexmark to be a great product. I found that the seller failded to give important information.Does this order come with both black & color ink, and is the USB cable encluded. I have emailed seller for this information, but still fail to get a response. I would have liked to know if I had to purchase any additional products to use this item."
2,HOLLYWOOD CLAPBOARD HOOKS NOT A BLOCKBUSTER,"HOOKS ARE GREAT FOR DECORATING ONLY, I PUT THEM IN MY NEW ""HOOLYWOOD BATHROOM"" AND USED THEM ON THE SEPERATE SHOWER. THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO COME APART AND LEAVE THE METAL HOOKS SEPERATED FORM THE REST. IF YOU PLAN TO HANG THEM AND NEVER MOVE THEM THEY ARE GREAT ...BUT IF YOU PLAN TO HAVE A FUNCTIONING SHOWER, I WOULD SUGGEST SOMETHING ELSE."
2,cute but cheap,The movie star shower hooks are very cute but easily damaged. As i was hanging my new curtain with the hooks some fell apart. i had to get superglue to get it to stay together.
5,Great lower fat snack,Great lower fat snack. I love Cheetos but the fat grams are too high for my older body and metabolism. These are great tasting and have sensible fat grams. Enjoy!
5,Sweet Sue plays Sensual Sax,Sweet Sue Terry's new CD Gilly's Caper is great listening for a warm summer afternoon or cool winter night with the one you love.
4,Not Just A Chick Flick....Guys Should See This Too!!!,"A realistic portrayal of the dark side of the glizty entertainment industry with humorous and earthy qualities running throughout the film. Well worth watching to see that many times honest efforts are misinterpreted and harsh judgements are made, especially when one isn't aware of a person's true motivation. Great film."
2,Rent It......Maybe.,"I watched this because it has Big Gipp from the Goodie Mobb in it. That is the high point, the movie is not very good. If your a Goodie Mobb fan rent it just out of curiosity. If not stay away from this one."
4,Cat in the Hat is GREAT!!,We bought Cat In The Hat for C-mas and it is great!! We love the graphics and the challenges. Everyone that comes over gets addicted to it and can't stop playing it. Getting to the different levels is way fun!! Adults and kids alike will like this one!!
5,So much fun!,"This game is just right for a kid or a video game-challenged adult like me! It is not hard to navigate and the Cat doesn't ""fly"" across the screen so you can't see where you are going, but is still entertaining enough to keep your attention."
3,Not What I Ordered,I ordered several new games for my 7 and 2 year old. When receiving this product I opened it to find that it was a Crash game instead of the Dr. Suess game that I initially ordered. My 7 year old enjoyed the Crash game but it would have been nice if I had received the Dr. Suess game instead.
2,"Over-priced, over-rated","Cannot completely scrape all the white stuff off the tongue. Don't expect too much from this. The quality of this also feels cheap, it should be sold in the dollar stores."
3,It gets stuff off my tongue but...,"IMO this product does a good job of getting whatever's on top of the tongue off. However, it does not completely scrape all that white stuff off. Point is, if you have white tongue, it's not going to turn pink using this."
1,try others,I bought this at a health food store expecting it to be better then the plastic ones I had in the past.Nope wasted a few dollars.I dont like the metal at all.Holding the handles are wabble wabble.Im going back to the sturdy plastic one.
2,"good idea, but doesn't work as well as breath remedy","It's so wide and so much material in your mouth it's hard to get your tongue up far/flat enough to get a good scrape. I still prefer the less wide, but more effective plastic Breath Remedy version - tho it's hard to find w/o the rubber scraper insert."
3,cheaper at the Indian stores,"This isn't something new. Steel toungue scrapers are a daily part of hygiene in the indian culture. If you live in a community that has an indian grocery store, go in and ask for this. It will be cheaper."
2,It is just a piece of metal with rubber handles,"I paid about 13.00 for this scraper. It is just a piece of stainless steel with two rubber ends to hold on to. I have bad breath, and my mother told me that it was because of my tongue not being clean and stuff in between my teeth. I floss all the time so it isn't that part. I tried using this because I read so many good reviews that a bunch of stuff comes off your tongue like plaque and stuff. I guess it was too good to be true. This might work if I have a bunch of stuff leftover on my tongue, but when i brush my teeth and rinse out, there is nothing left on my tongue. I scraped my tongue 4 times with this and saw NOTHING on the thing. I will try it again, but I doubt it will perform miracles."
4,Overall a great product!,Overall it's a great product the one complaint I have is that it feels a little to wide but that might just be a personal preference.
4,Gets the job done,I use this tongue scraper every night and it definitely works. The metal is flat so it doesn't cut up your tongue while still removing 90% of that nasty build up. I have a medium sized mouth and the size and shape of this cleaner fit perfect for me.
5,works great,"bought this for my 8 yr old who gags every time i brush his tounge, making it difficult to clean well. he scrapes his own tounge and has had no bad breath since we started using this. it does not make him gag and does not hurt him at all. very easy to use, very effective. I love it!"
4,-Tongue cleaner,"It is nice and sturdy, just wish it had more of a serrated edge. I like it a lot and well made."
4,great product,"Great cleaner, works as must be and doesn't get black. 3 times per day and tongue is almost shiny!unfortunately, i didn't get the color i wanted."
4,Pretty good tongue cleaners,We just purchased two tongue cleaners and they work pretty well. The handles are padded/comfortable to grip and you can bend them in or out to adjust them to your tongue. I'd recommend them.
1,Dr Tung's Toungue Cleaner,"I have been using a plastic Oolitt tongue cleaner for a while and it needed replacement. I was excited to see this product since it was stainless steel, a metal known to kill many germs. I am sorry to say that the only thing this did was cut my tongue. I would not recommend this product, especially if you have a soft tongue or are a child. My dentist tells me the human mouth has more bacteria than any other part of the body. The risk of introducing a bloodstream infection is not very high but it is still a risk I don't want to take. I'll stick with the Oolitt."
1,A waste of money,"You're better off using a regular toothbrush to clean your tongue. This thing literally takes 10+ minutes to scrap of 80% of the gunk, while a normal toothbrush only requires 2 minutes to do the job. Save your money."
1,"Never Again, No Way, No How","This thing hung on a peg in my bathroom for a couple of years. The plastic handles discolored and developed cracks and droplets of some kind of clear liquid slowly oozed from them, eventually dripping off. Now, I have no idea what the liquid was, but it certainly seems the plastic was decomposing. Regardless, is that something you want near your mouth and even in it? Sorry, but this piece of junk deserves zero stars, if that were possible."
1,Adorable cartoon on the package but scraper doesn't do anything,"A few hours after I brush and floss my teeth, I feel like I need to brush again, even if I haven't eaten anything. I thought this meant that I needed a tongue scraper, so I got this one.This Dr. Tung's tongue cleaner is adorably packaged, with a cute little illustration of Dr. Tung in white lab coat and glasses. The product is well-built and fits into my toothbrush holder in my bathroom. And it doesn't hurt or anything.I've been using it daily for a week, and I don't feel cleaner. I don't know whether this tongue scraper isn't effective or if I don't need a tongue scraper, after all. Still don't know why I feel like I need to brush my teeth even if I haven't eaten anything lately."
1,Nevr recieved package,I wouldn't know because I never recieved it nor has anyone gotten back to me from customer service. Very disappointed
5,this is the greatest invention of all time,Greater than even the iphone or macbook pro.My gf says my breath doesn't smell no mores.And i'm like ; D
5,wonderful product,my breath never tastes(and smells!)as fresh without using it. a tongue scraper should be in everyone's medicine cabinet right next to the toothbrush. use it often!
1,"Uncomfortable, Awkward and Ineffective","This is very awkward to use and does not clean my tongue effectively. The awkwardness may be due to the fact that I have a very small mouth, but even when I do manage to utilize it it doesn't leave my tongue or breath feeling any cleaner. I had a plastic cleaner that did a much better job but I can't find it now and don't know who makes it. (Aargh!) I think if you have a small mouth like me you may want to think twice. It says adjustable but because of the shape of the tool itself there is only so much adjusting to be done."
1,Didn't work,Got this because no matter how much I brush my teeth and tongue and floss I cant get rid of this unpleasant smell in my mouth. This didn't workk
5,Best tongue scraper,I've tried other tongue scrapers before but none seem to work as well as this one. The stainless steel definitely seems more hygienic than other plastic ones you find at the store. Just don't be shocked from the gunk you find on your tongue after you first use this.
3,works as well as plastic drug store kind,"This tongue cleaner works fine, but no better than the average plastic kind you can find at the drug store. I actually ended up preferring the plastic kind to this one because I didn't like the feel of metal scraping my tongue. It's perfectly effective, but nothing really worth the trouble of ordering online."
5,This is the best!,"I have used this tongue scraper for years. (It would probably last forever!) It is the best, don't even think the plastic ones at the stores compare to it. It is quick, easy, and sanitary. It is a great little stocking stuffer for the kids. When you start using a tongue scraper you will never do without one again!"
2,not that great,"After reading the good reviews, I decided to try out this tongue cleaner, instead of the plastic ones that I have been so accustomed to over the years. Well, I wish I just ordered a regular plastic one, because for one, the item did not ship until three weeks after placing my order, so I did not receive it for over two weeks after the expected arrival date. That's a long time to go around with bad breath. But more importantly, the product quality is not very good. It is messy and difficult to rinse off, clean, and store. I much rather prefer the plastic kind that can fit in a cup or a toothbrush slot."
4,Tongue cleaner,"The Tongue cleaner is an excellent way to clear the film on your tongue before every meal; Especially in the morning; Also good before going to bed at night. EVERYTHING tastes so much better and it gets rid of bad breath too!.BUT, be careful when ordering; Perhaps best to order several at the same time, as otherwise the shipping charges are far too high for such a lightweight small item!"
4,Good investment..,"It works very well and is easy to hang on to. My previous one was plastic and this work so mch better,"
4,A rare book!,Almost NO attention is paid to scadinavian royal families! It was nice to find good info. on them and other obscere royal families. I recommend this book for people with scandinavian heritage
4,A Young Horse Lovers Dream,"My daughter is only 4-years old and loves this game. This was the first game we bought for our X-Box. She has ""mastered"" it numerous times and still loves to play it! She absolutely loves it! It is a game without violence that is helping her learn about horses and is definitely helping her with her coordination skills. When we go to visit our real horse, she sometimes refers to things that she did while playing the game! We have the Game Boy Advance Barbie Horse Adventure and the PC Barbie Mystery Ride and this one is the family favorite!"
4,BARBIE DIES!!! (How To),"To make Barbie fall endlessly / go under a rock:On the last trail (Shorline Trail 3), there is a boardwalk with rides and a lighthouse. Right before the boardwalk begins, there is some water. Get off your horse and walk into the water as far as Barbie can go. Around where a large rock is, there is a small triangular inlet in the ground in the water. Walk into it and Barbie is able to walk under water! Walk farther to the edge and she falls into oblivion and technically dies! Something else you can do under water is go under the large rock. Walk under water to the rock and you're soon inside of it! This is the best cheat ever!!!"
5,havent played it but i want to badly,i geuss its bad that ive not played it yet butt i love horses and barbie and i want to download it so bad on to my computer so if u now please i need to now. graffics look awsome .horsesok well whatever later
4,Game,"This game starts out really fun, you like customizing your horse to fit you.After awhile it starts getting kinda boring because the foals get really annoying because you cant find them all, or barbie doesnt run very well.But over-all this game is fun"
2,"If you want a cute game for girls, get Mario Kart, not this.","Obviously, this game was made for little girls, but there's better games out there that might appeal to girls without insulting their intelligence.I'm actually exaggerating a bit, this game is not nearly as bad as it could have been. Most of the gameplay is built on riding your horse, which borrows a lot from the Zelda 64 riding engine. Once you get off your horse though to look for runaway horses, watch out. Barbie is slow on her feet and can't run, which can get very annoying. There are also side activities, like unlocking outfits and washing your horse, which is as rudimentary as using the cursor brush to move over a horse.But overall this game sucks. If you want to buy a game for your sister/daughter/niece, get her a real game with quality gameplay, like Mario Kart Double Dash or Super Monkey Ball."
5,My 5 yr old daughter LOVES this game!,"She can't get enough of it! If you have a daughter that loves horses and Barbie, this is a must have!"
2,The Kama Sutra Illuminated.,This is a book of supposed coital conjuctions described and illustrated in ancient Indian literature as visualized bywriters of the period. I didn't find it very illuminating and have no fondness for art of this period.
1,Do not waste your time.,"I received this product as a gift for Christmas. I found it here on amazon and added it to my wishlist. After finally getting all of the pieces organized, I realized how poor of quality the wood was. A few of the pieces required a screw, however one hole was WAY too big for a screw to properly work. Also, the screws supplied are flat-ended, not pointed like appropriate wood screws. The picture makes this project look like a beautiful addition to any home, but it is not worth the problems that arise while assembling the product."
1,Terrible Product,"I received this product and when trying to assemble it, the notches that were cut out to fit the legs were to small, so when you inserted the legs the wood split on all sides!!!! This was very cheap product and I would not buy this again."
2,disappointed,This was recommended reading from a popular preaching website as a book useful to pastors in the work of preaching. In my opinion many of the stories were just too unbelieveable or unfaithful to the Biblical material. I was disappointed in the book.
4,An Amazing Story,"Although the writing in the book is nowhere near as proficient as 'The Forest Wife', 'Moon Riders' is definately worth the time. At first I thought I was going to love the book, but when I started reading and got bored with it's slowness I was sure that forcing myself to read it would make me hate it. Guess what? It was well worth getting passed the boring stuff, because it all adds up in the end. I was amazed with the story, and utterly fell in love with it. Well worth the effort."
1,Bullshit! would not take return,"Ordered this hat. it is a cheap and made of foam... I did not buy it for Halloween, but ordered on Oct 30th. After requesting an RAN# I was told that their policy is no return of Halloween Items after October 30th..It is pretty hard to return before October 30th when I did not receive until November 3rd.I will never buy anything from this company againI call bullshit!Crystale"
1,Coleman abandoned this lamp with good reeason,"It worked good for about twenty minutes after its first full charge, shorter times after each subsequent charge. Now it won't take a charge at all. Coleman went cheap and showed cheap. The product number doesn't appear on their Web site, even in the Repair Parts section.I quit buying Black and Decker for the same reason: poor-quality rechargeables. I'd rather do without than be victimized by either company again.Adios."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SURF CDs YOU CAN BUY,"At 27 tracks this is really a generous helping of Sentinals material, and they definitely were one of the most skilled of all the original surf bands in the early 60s. It should be noted too that this contains all the tracks from the ""Surfer Girl"" cd/lp (although in a different track-order), making that one mandatory only for collectors. ""Sunset Beach"" is the one to get, and the Del-Fi original issue is becoming very hard-to-find, especially the non cut-out copies!"
5,99% Alcohol,This was purchased for cleaning printers. No complaints here. Arrived very quickly. And was a good price for the product.
4,work great,"its great for my application, this and liquid lanolin works great for case lube and you don't have to degrease when you are done, better than Hornady one shot"
4,Great for cleaning makeup brushes,"I use this to clean my makeup brushes, and it's better than any brush cleaner on the market. I keep a small squirt bottle near my makeup area and every day I squirt a little onto each brush as soon as I'm done using it, then swirl the brush around on a hand towel to remove makeup residue. For deep cleans I pour a little into a small cup and swish the brush in it for a few seconds, then swirl it around on the towel. My brushes have never been cleaner or more sanitary, and this bottle costs less than expensive brush cleaners and lasts longer too. It even works on mySigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki - F80, one of the most difficult brushes to keep clean. Try it--your complexion will thank you!"
2,Great Concept vs. Poor Product,"YMMV but I have a few recommendations:PROS----1. Filter for keeping the crud in the kettle at bay2. Sleek and Intuitive to handle, I figured it out within minutes of opening it from the box3. It boils water for my daily brew of teaCONS----1. Filter is HARD to put back after cleaning... I still havent got it on2. Its NOT CORDLESS so for the price its not worth it in my opinion3. The ON/OFF switch DOES NOT work at all !!! May be a manufacturer defect... but I was kind of counting on it ..OVERALL-------Might as well boil water on the stove, without the auto-shut off its pretty much useless."
2,Disappointing,Was advertised as being cordless but was not. Simply stopped heating water just over a year and a half of use.
3,Good value,"Works well. I like it when turn off when water boil, portable.Notice this product does not have separate base. so you use it near the electric outlet"
5,fast to boil,this heater heats to a boil in a under five min bought it for work will have to get one for home to
5,Best 1.7 liter water heater,Product arrived in a timely manner and was perfect. It does exactly what the advertisement stated.
5,Great Thing to Have,"This electric kettle is great. 1.7 liters is more than plenty of water and it boils quickly and easily. The kettle is simple to use and very effective. My only complaint is that the cord is a little on the short side (at least for my preferences), but this really isn't that much of a problem as you can always unplug it if need be. Overall, this is a great choice if you're looking for a good electric kettle."
3,"Not scale, but still pretty good.","This is definitely not a scale gun, it's probably more for kids. The reason that I got it was the price, and the RIS for where the grip would normally be, so that I could put a dot scope there. The tac light is actually quite bright which is nice. But the extendable stock doesn't lock very well. If too much pressure is put on the stock, it will start to slide forward. It's a good price for a relatively decent gun with nice extras."
5,The Artist's Way at Work : Riding the Dragon,"This is an incredibly powerful book, with very easy things to get started right away. The first step is to write 3 pages a day, and don't look at what you have written for at least a month. It gets the flow going in you first thing in the morning."
2,"Fair Warning, Preview the Book","Reading the book for a masters level creativity class so I started out a skeptic. While much of the reading in the class has turned out to be very interesting, this book just hasn't struck any chords for me.Some of the poeple in the class seem to appreciate it so it gets an extra star... but I'd suggest reading some of it before picking it up. If it works for ya, go for it. Otherwise, be cautious."
1,please offer this as a kindle book - not an audio book,I know I'm not alone in my dislike of audio books. Please offer the text version of this book in an electronic format.Thank you.
1,They must be kidding,This must be a joke. Writing yet another book on creativity that is simply a rehash of the original book with a slightly different twist. Not an example of creative thinking in my estimation. Don't waste your money.
3,Work and play,"Creativity in the workplace is a contradiction for many - after all, work is something we do in between 'play', right? Passive, punch the clock behavior does not help anybody, including our employers, so why do we go on, complaining about this state of affairs? Mark Bryan's ""Aristst's Way at Work"" series is a great read, and a call to action: you are the one responsible for your well-being, so reach deep, find your passions and give yourself room for try and fail at many different things.""Artist's Way at Work"" is a great complimentary read, and I suggest you also take a look at ""Finding the Element"" by Sir Ken Robinson (if you want to learn more about finding your passions), or ""The Success Principles"" by Jack Canfield (if you feel lack of control)."
1,Required for a class,I am not sure what this book is meant to accomplish. More self-help than actual functional creative process guide. Book it written for the disenchanted and those that work in or for corporations without true leadership.
2,"Promising Title, Disappointing Contents",This book seemed to fall between two stools. It wasn't a user-friendly self-help book because it wasn't written in an accessible way but neither was it a serious academic text because it relied too much on a few case studies without the back-up of any harder evidence. I was disappointed.
4,Track Listing,One Day In ColourMorning WalkJoyfulDelicious PieThe Sound Of ChartreuseLester Leaps InSpring SongStay TunedLet's DissolveKnight's CastleOnd Day In Colour
1,Pass on this one,"Thirty years ago a co-worker brought a casette tape recording of ""The Contest"" to work and played it for us one lunch time. We all roared with laughter, the British accents and sound effects and absurd tale of two men vying for the world championship of noisy wind-passing. Recently the topic (passing wind) came up and I searched Amazon for a recording. This CD features the original recording in two parts and it is faithful to the recording I remember. It is still very funny and I enjoyed hearing it again. But the remaining tracks on this CD are not worth your time or money. I'm no prude (an ex-sailor I know all the dirty words) but this collection of Friar's Club Roasts is way too much. I suggest you save your money, I wish I had."
5,What a great collectible,This is what i would rate a 5+ Great over all and just try and find a price like this you wont.Thanks so much Doll TV---Love to see more outer limits figures.
3,"not too bad a sampler, but omits several hits","Well at least the ""BMG Heritage"" series did it right when it put out three seperate discs one for each phase of the band's lifespan. Yet each one comes up short of actual hits in favor of a mix of hit singles and album tracks. This one omits ""With Your Love""(1976), ""Find Your Way Back""(1981) and ""Be My Lady""(1982), and instead substitutes them with lesser-known or non-hit tracks like ""Hot Water"" and ""Freedom at Point Zero""?"
1,Unhappy,I purchased this phone and took it to Jamaica for a friend...it wouldn't work and when the repair person looked at it we were told that it had a used board and was not fixable. My paperwork had been thrown out before I got home and so it ended up being a mistake that I couldn't remedy. Very dissapointed.
1,BATTERY don't last.... at all! TERRIBLE!,The worst ever! I had it for only one week and had to return it... thank God! Main problem: BATTERY. Terrible battery life. I'm not a big talker at all! You will need to charge this phone every night.
3,cell phone,"good phone but did not serve my purpose, couldn't use with my cell phone service provider"
1,Terrible,"I rec'd this product and could obviously tell it was a secondhand product that was painted (paint 'patch-ups' are obviously visible). The product seems to have been a very much used secondhand phone that was refurbished, but it was not refurbished well as the phone has a constant buzzing sound when calls are made and rec'd."
1,Really Bad Quality. I will never buy again in HassleFreeCell.,"About two years ago I bought a Motorola V3, it was fantastic, the phone was great. About 5 months ago I decided to buy one for my wife, so I bought it in HassleFreeCell, one day before the celphone arrives her mother gifts her a Nokia, so I decided to have the phone as a backup cell phone.Last week my current phone started having issues, so I decided to use this ""BRAND NEW MOTOROLA V3"". When I opened the box I found that the mobile does not have the same Quality of my last V3, the battery cover is made from bad quality material, the quality of the pieces is awful. I had used the phone for two days and it already stop working, now I get why they didn't compromise with the warranty of the phone.I will never buy something there, this phone is completely different from the first V3 that I used for two year without any problems."
1,RAZR problems,I have received 2 defective Black RAZRs and am now waiting for yet another replacement that will not ship until after the first of the year. If that one is bad I will ask for a refund and buy a different cell phone.
3,Comes w/ UK plug,"I got a great price on a good phone and not complaining about or reviewing that. My comments and stars are for ""in the box"" stuff.I'm extraordinarily bitter than this version came with the big silly UK 3 prong plug. I scoured all the documentation and couldn't find that said anything for sure. My fingers were crossed that this ""international version"" would come with the two prong deal used widely across Europe.Of course, it's a universal voltage & Hz thing that only needs the physical adapter. Oddly, the packaging included an adapter for US style plugs. So they're trying. But to use in Europe will need another adapter."
1,Cheated.,"I bought this phone because I liked the design, and found the price irresistible. The phone has been nothing but a huge problem ever since I got it.Although it seemed packed like a new phone, there seemed something suspicious because it had both AT&T; and T Mobile symbols on it (on the cover and software respectively).- The battery, seemingly new, requires charging every two hours.- It gives ""Insert SIM"" messages even when there is a SIM inside.- The phone switches off unexpectedly.I am ""tech savvy"" enough to know that this is not normal behavior in phones.I feel cheated."
1,Cool looking BUT very cheaply built,"I've been using a silver RAZR for 2 months and here are my conclusions:THE BAD:- BROKE!! After 1 month it stopped operating - the screen turned on but I had no access to my data nor could I make any use of the phone to receive or make calls. So despite the positive aspects mentioned below, I cannot rate it any better. Goes to show that quality control isn't Motorola's strong point.- Short battery life. Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Calendar, alarm, notes, contacts cannot be synchronized with Outlook.- Awful camera resolution. Plus, the camera doesn't take video.- No MP3 player.THE GOOD:- Free! (or at least very cheap if you don't buy with a plan).- Decent reception.- Universal system - you can travel with it anywhere (you might need to pre-authorize this with your operator).- Can be charged with a USB cable.- Slick, slim, cool look.- Bluetooth range."
4,Decent product.,It is a decent product for regular voice users. The design is quite neat and clean. One charge of the battery gives almost one week's worth of standby hours. Another plus is that this phone has Input in Chinese.
1,phone gets hot after few minutes of talking,"Got this phone less than 1 year. But, now as I talk, the phone becomes so hot that it hurts my ear and my hand. I hate this phone. It's a piece of junk. It looks fancy but not practical. And then I have to charge it every night otherwise, the battery dies so quickly even though I hardly use my phone."
3,Watch out - this is a European edition phone,"Phone works fine in general. Two issues I have are:1) European edition phone means: charger is European and includes a US adapter (cumbersome), Time is in 24 hr format and can't be changed to 12 hr format, Date is in YY/MM/DD format and can't be changed to MM/DD/YY format2) Volume is too low"
1,WORST PHONE I EVER HAD!!!,"I've had this phone just about six months. Total disaster. I flip it open and it goes blank. I touch it gently and it goes blank. Sometimes the screen comes back to life, sometimes I have to press the on button for about 2 minutes to get the screen back. Frustrating and useless is what this phone has become. Most people I know who have this phone hate it. I just ordered the Blackberry Curve. As soon as I get it I'm taking the RAZR V3 and smashing it into a million pieces."
2,What a piece of junk!,"I read the other reviews, heard about the dreaded ""white screen"" and figured it couldn't happen to me.It did. Now I will be without this POS until Motorola can fix what apparently is a design flaw. There is a problem with the flip design as, like others, my phone shuts off when I close it, or it will shut off during a call, or it will cycle off at any time-with no warning.Of course it is 6 days past the return point for Amazon.I really used to like this phone-but I need reliable."
1,Worst Phone,"This really is the worst phone ever, do not buy it.It breaks without warning, weather it snaps in half, the side things holding the wires fall off, or all the keys come unresponsive.If you want the phone just for the looks (which aren't that great) Make sure you get insurance on it, because it will break.I haven't had this brand of phone for a year yet, and I have gone through four.Worst phone."
4,RAZR V3,"I am very happy with the product. Volume could be better, having some problems seting up to bluetooth hands free."
3,Very nice -- beautiful design,"But I tried twice to have the software updated to get it to work with my local service provider, T-Mobile. The online browsing still does not work. And as for the voice-activated dialing, I can't get that to work, either. I have another Razer, purchased locally from T-Mobile and it works on that one."
4,No Data Sharing.,"I am very happy with the phone and the price I paid for it, considering that after I lost mine it would have cost me close to $400 to replace it from the store.The only problem is that Cingular can't set up my picture/data sharing because it's a foreign phone. I believe mine is from Germany and it's a slightly different version, so my provider wasn't able to set that part up."
2,battery of no use at all,"am having to return the product back to amazon. the standby time on the battery is barely 1 day. also the caller pic id function does not work. the camera resolution is pathetic. however i like the phone overall and am buying another one from another sourcehowever amazon has been good in terms of a full refund (yet to recieve, but they have promised)."
2,Product Great but Seller is Shady,"The phone that I purchase is great. It met all of the expectations of the razor phone. BUT, the product description was misleading. It said that it was ""Unlocked for use with your existing GSM 850 MHz, GSM 1800 MHz, GSM 900 MHz or GSM 1900 MHz service provider"" To the untrained purchaser(me) I ""assumed"" (you know what happens when you assume!) that it was good for ANY service provider. My son tried to use it with his Verizon account and was unable to get it hooked up. At the very least, I think that the seller should have had a link (Like the one he sent me when I tried to return it!) to explain which providers it was good for. The seller was very shady in his presentation of the product. But if you have one of the GSM providers the phone is wonderful!"
1,Motorola RAZR V3,Owned a previous RAZR V3 had no problems. Purchased one recently as a gift for Mother's Day. The phone worked well except the ringer started out very low and within a week it stopped ringing or vibrating. After several missed call and multiple attempts to correct ringer I stopped using the phone.
2,camera,I purchased cell for my wife since she had an exact cell that was just old. Unfortunately after one week the screen no longer comes on. The keyboard works but no screen. It can not be exchanged since she had taken the cell with her on vacation and returns after the 30 day return policy.
3,cell phone review,"It is good phone for an older cell phone. There is a couple of bad things though the battery I had to replace, an there is no ring tone to notify you that there is a text message other than that I can live with the phone it will work for a good back up phone."
1,Disappointing,"I just got the phone and stopped working on the fifteenth day, the phone turns on, but none of the two screens on, I bought at The OEM Planet, I feel cheated ..."
1,Charging problems,"Like some other reviewers, the phone I received had charging problems. Even with the power cord firmly seated into the phone, and the phone resting on a table, charging is intermittent. A phone that isn't guaranteed to charge over night when sitting on the nightstand is pretty useless."
2,From a foreign country,Quick notes on this phone is is german and can not be changed. Phone also makes a buzzing noise. Can't get or receive pictures. I have had another razr and this one had a cheap look and feel to it. Think it was a knock off.
1,Poor quality cell phone,The Motorola RAZR V3 cell phones I purchased are of poor quality. The battery life is short lived. Speaker doesn't work even when the volumn is at the maximum level. Voice messages shows up out of sequence.
1,I want my money back,This is worthless phone. I never expected that I would get a phone in this condition. The volume is coming too low. i couldn't hear anything from the other side. The connections is coming and going. After using 10-15 mins the battery is getting fully discharged. Not being able to use it for more than 2-3 days. I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great. I simply want my money back.
1,Moto razr,"It is a sleek nice looking phone was sealed with new battery. Performance wise one of the worst phones ever. The battery does not last for more than 2 calls. While it shows flu charge after two calls the battery dies. Replaced the battery with new battery, the new battery, but it gives a message ""invalid battery"".It is not the worth the price."
1,terrible,This product did not even last a week. The screen went black and never worked after 7 days..It was the worstpurchase I ever made
1,do not buy anything cheap,"The first one I got from the seller could not be turned on properly. The seller promised to send me another one once I mailed the first one back. The second one functioned normally only for a few hours. Then it showed a sign of ""emergency call only"". Can not receive incoming call or make a phone call. Finally, I realized the seller just got a bunch of defected products in a very low price then sell them to anyone looking for a good bargain. Really learn a lesson from amazon.com. I would like to rate this item ""0"" but then can not post my review. So do not be fool by that ""single"" star."
1,Worst piece,Cellphone worked for one week then caused issues.unable to power on.sometimes unable to key in.This product is good but the seller sent me the worst cellphone.
1,Motorola Junk,"This is a piece of junk, It was wrapped up so nice and pretty as if it was brand new. But the quality of the phone proved that to be not true at all. My phone never worked it want hold a charge. I just wasted my money. Now I cannot find anyone to return it to and amazon is no help at all. So I am stuck with a piece of junk. Therefore I will think long and hard before ordering from amazon.Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Camera, and Video Player--International Version with No Warranty (Black)"
1,"Don't Waste Your Money, Buy A Samsung","I will have to say that this phone is the most annoying piece of garbage ever. I think it was functional for about 30 min out of the box new. I picked it up from T-Mobile (Also go with Verizon, TMobile eats it!) Limited Text Messages, no ringtones that are worth while, alerts are constant and repetitive for a drained battery ( Here's a tip motorola - save battery power, STOP THE DAMN ALERTS!) Next, how about a functional T9 dictionary, because the suggestions and predictions that this one makes are like wierd spelled w3ird and of instead of the...home instead of good...and people is puprse....I know that it's made for gooks but still keep your slope grammer elsewhere cuz we don't want it in the USA...bottom line...don't waste your money on any motorola cell phone products because they are a parasitic device hellbent on destroying every last hope of a functional and user friendly Cell Phone."
1,NO NO and NO never buy RAZR any more,"Look at this:1.There is no way to snooze an alarm, you have to open the flip and browse to snooze, already woke up by doing this.If you press external button to silent an alarm it shuts it and alarm will not be active anymore.2.Side buttons ALWAYS pressed accidentally switching ring style to VIBRATE oONLY or to ALL OFF. Which REALLY annoying because you WILL miss the call!!! What the stupid design!!3. Battery SUCKS!4.NO SPEAKER PHONE - if you are working in noisy locations forgetaboutitIT is Really anoing to miss a call for NO REASON but only the reason that side buttons occasionally pressed switched ring to ALL OFF."
4,not exactly a new product,"I received the phone, which was brand new, as far as I could tell, but everything else inside the package looked used, the manual was dogeared, and some of the internal packaging itself showed significant wear and tear. Phone seems to work fine, bbut nowhere in the advertisement did it say anything about refurbished or used products. I was a little surprised, and disappointed..."
4,I needed a unlocked GSM phone.,"I purchased over a year ago from Amazon for 279.00. I need an unlocked GSM phone for travel out of the county. It worked fine but it is hard to position on the ear to hear well. Belt clip that came with it broke right away. There are not any good cases for this thing, and I have purchased a few. The blue tooth worked better with it than the actual phone for hearing well. Camera is as bad as everyone says it is. I don't talk alot so I get 3 days on a battery charge. This works well on TMOBILE but when Cingular switched to AT&T the phone sounds like crap most the time to the person on the other end of the phone. I have 2 sim cards and the TMOBILE service is much better! Someone needs to just make a phone ONLY. I carry a good camera and own an Ipod I never use. So I use the phone, just as a phone."
1,"crappy company, crappy product","I bought this phone for my mom, in the description it states that this was a BRAND NEW PHONE. that was so far from the truth its not even funny. The hinge was broken and it still had music on it from the previous owner. Needless to say, I will never purchase from this ""company"" again nor will I recommend it."
2,not quite right,screens displayed upside down. dropped most calls. bad delay with buttons. Sometimes would give the blue screen of death and completely freeze. Would suggest buying legit phone from legit phone company
2,razrv3,"I am really dissapointed with this phone. I was advertised as new, but was refurbished. I can hardly hear the person talking. After receiving the phone i had to pay a specialty store 25.00 to enable the phone to send and receive pics."
3,MOTOROLA,PHONE IS NOT INTERNATIONAL VERSION OR WORLD PHONE AND I HATE EVERY TIME I POWER UP OR GO TO CERTAIN FEATURES IT SAYS AT&T WHICH I CANT STAND I HAVE T-MOBILE SERVICE THEY JUST UNLOCKED AN AT&T PHONE.
3,Did not receive everything listed.,"I got the razr v3 and i'm very happy with it, only the European charger was not included. This is exactly why I chose this particular phone, because Im an exchange student and when i go back to belgium, I will need the european charger! So Im pretty sad that it's not there. If its not going to be included, it shouldn't be listed on the website, That's just fooling people. I could've gotten the phone anywhere else."
2,Rip Off,"This phone does nothing but evoke anger in me. I bought it because of the features is claims to have yet none of them work. For one the manual, boasts you can use a memory card in it, which is false because this phone features no memory card slot. It says it has MP3 playback and all that but good luck getting any of it on your phone. The phone won't even receive E-mails like it's supposed to. I have a bottom of the line phone from Motorola that's two years old and it has this feature. I have no problem with the phone other then that, it looks great and I don't mind the Keypad. Other then it coming with a damaged LCD screen and the issues I listed above I would have loved to keep it.If you plan to use it for a phone and nothing else it's great but otherwise I'd pass."
2,Deceptive,"I bought this product with high hopes at a high price. It did NOT live up to my expectations at all. The phone is NOT a good value for the money. It shuts off randomly for no apparent reason, often makes a buzzing/static noise and drops calls, then restarts the phone. Sometimes the screen turns black and just wont do anything. First phone I have had to replace at some point during my contract. Pictures are not very good quality, although I could really care less about that. Bottom line is do not buy this phone without SERIOUSLY SHOPPING AROUND FIRST!!!"
2,"Fancy, cute, and sub-standard","I have a RAZR and find it attractive, thin (which is nice) and unlike some folks find the interface fairly decent.Problems: needs to be restarted every day. In many cases, going from one cell to the next causes the phone to drop reception entirely. Once you make a datebook entry, you can 't edit it. At least I have not yet found a way. Sensitivity stinks to high heaven.After my dismal experience with a StarTac, I doubt I will be a Motorola customer again. Their drop in quality over the years tells me that yet another fine company is headed for the toilet of history. I will go back to Nokia and be done with it."
1,phone is nothing but problems - not authentic razr,"I've ordered 3 of these phones from 2 different sellers and had problems with all 3. The screen went out on the first one after 2 days, and Amazon promptly refunded my money but couldn't send another since they were out of stock. I ordered another from a different seller and the phone arrived with a huge crack on the screen. After arguing with the 2nd seller, he finally agreed to send a replacement. The replacement (3rd phone) worked for few days and then the audio went out so the person on the other end would only hear static. A total waste of time and money. The text messaging didn't work on any of the 3 phones."
2,so overrated,"The nice thing about this phone is that it's thin, but it comes with lots of drawbacks. The phone is rather wide and when using a bluetooth wireless headset you lose your individual ringers so you don't know who's calling. If there's ever a time you don't want to look at the phone to see who's calling it's when you've got a wireless headset. My biggest gripe with this phone though is you can't hear it. Even with the volume turned all the way up it's nowhere near loud enough. You need to be in a dead quiet room to hear your voicemail, for example. Lastly they're rather unreliable. I had to exchange mine twice due to display failures and the one I've got now the outside screen doesn't sit right, it sits down below the metal edge."
2,Style over substance,It may be thin but that is just about its only saving grace. Next to any current Nokia it seems flimsy and poorly made. Not great.
3,Ok Phone,"My son purchased his Razr at a HIGH dollar price. It does have GREAT features but he only had it a little more than a month and the whole screen went white !!! For the price and ""high technise"" of this phone you would think the screen would be Higher quality.If you purchase one be very careful.Dont just carry it in your pocket."
1,"Not enough detail, next day delivery failed","I thaught this phone was going to work for Verizon. But, no, because Verizon don't use ""sim'card. So I had to return it for credit. On 08/28/2008 Thursday Amazon said I will get this phone ""next day delivery"" 08/29/2008 Friday so I paid next day air. But I didn't receive it till Tues.09/02/2008.So, I'm rating Amazon 1/2 star. for false delivery service. Sharon :)-"
4,good value for the money,It has been a very satisfactory phone. I would suggest getting US phone charger in place of the foreign one and adapter that came with the phone.Good value for the Money
3,It's okay..,"We each have a razr, dh has this one and I have the Cherry Blossom Razr. We've had them for over a year and dh is very pleased. I had an issue with the screen on my first one, and got a replacement and have had no more issues. I have to say I have had cheaper phones in the past that have had better reception than this. I love the thin and sleak style though. :)"
3,I just got my razr v3,"For a few years I have been with verizon .My last phone was the Motorola e815 .Recently I retired and didn't need all the mins I got on the $39 plan(with taxes came to $44) pro: I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T-Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great.con:When I went to program speed dialing .Boy was I disappointed .First it would only allow 20 voice tags .Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I didn't have to record my voice on each number,anyones voice would work using any name in my phone book .The Razr is supposed to be an improvement ,which it's not .The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned ,and now Motorola screwed it up .Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dial,taking your hands off the wheel .Wake up Motorola ,Thats stupid ."
3,Work well for a time then locked up.,I liked this phone for about a year. Small good looking a resonable camera phone. Then one day after charging it for a night the keyboard sytopped working. The only soft button that would work was the on/off soft button. After looking on the internet it looks like motorola built a bunch of these with bad seals around the back display so humidity will get to the circuit board. I like the phone but it is not relialable.
4,Great cheap phone,"I bought the RAZR V3 to replace my wife's broken RAZR. The matte black finish is great, quality is just fine, and it works well with our carrier (ATT). However the phone came out of the box with Portugese or some similar language. I was easily able to change it to English, but it seems to not have an English dictionary for the auto fill feature of texting. It doesn't recognize even the simplest of English words."
3,Nice but buy US version,It is nice phone but the international version doesnt display or save miss call. A big problem. Not sure if that is because of a specific settings...
1,purchase of the motorola razor cell phone,"this phone does not charge, i left the charger on for 24 -48 hours. it does not charge and I cannot even use it.The phone is useless. i want to return it but i do not know how"
1,waste,I bought the product it didn't last for a day. It didn't hold charge. It is useless. Please do not purchase it. I will return it. Its not worth a penny.
1,RAZR V3 Knockoff ??,"This phone looks like the original but in fact was a cheap plastic model, not metal like the originals, which was powered by a below standard battery with low usage time available. It works but when I noticed the spelling on the setup for my PERSONALIZE (their spelling PERSONALISE) settings I knew I was in for other disappointments. Apparently the ""M"" on the phone does not mean it is really an original Motorola Phone."
3,good,i like the phone but the box is not what you receive from the original buyer :(further more i can see some scratches on the outer screen which i didn't expectthat's all thanks!!
2,Nice phone but horrible signal!!!,"This is a cool phone, easy to use and all the features are nice and easy. The worst part is reception. I had many phones before and never such a bad signal. Inside the building-forget about it in most situations. Trees, rain -everything is on the way!!!Do not recommend if you like to know that someone is calling you or texting right a way, and not wait until you will get a reception. !"
1,Dont buy this phone!!!!,POS phone. Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM. Everything else has to be stored in an extremely limited phone memory. There are many better phones for the money. I am disappointed with Motorola and they have definitely taken a turn for the worse in quality.
3,Good Purchase,"This is an unlocked phone but it wasn't the greatest. I thought that it wouldn't have any logos on the phone. But, it has an ATT logo on the back. It is actually a GoPhone. I inserted a GoPhone Sim card and every time I end a call, it makes a beeping noise. It's an ok purchase if you just like the Razor."
1,Buyer beware,"Three reasons not to buy this phone:1. It may be unlocked, but it is not unbranded. It still says AT&T; every time you turn it on, in the menu, and on the battery cover.2. The battery loses its charge within a day.3. It does not ship with the advertised ""European charger with U.S. adapter"". It is simply a U.S. charger.This phone is simply a lemon, and reading other reviews I realize I am not the first person to say so. Don't make the same mistake we did!"
2,No Battery provided,Product arrived without a battery - make sure you order one separately and don't take anything for granted!
1,Not a original Motorola,Please don't buy this one. Its not an original motorola device. Its not worth for this money. If you want I can send the picture of the phone which I bought it.
1,not a motorola.,"What I received was definitely a knock-off, not an actual motorola razr. It worked fine as a phone, but none of the data features worked, the manual was a poorly-bound photocopy, and all the parts were missing moto holograms. The buttons are also crooked, but seem to work okay. If it were $20 instead of $50, I'd complain less. Still probably not worth returning and fighting with the seller."
1,"Don't buy one from OEM! It was not ""unlocked""","I bought this phone to use for international travel. When I tried to put a SIM card in it from Germany or Spain, I received incessant messages one after another stating that it was not compatible with T Mobil....even if I did not use the phone. I had to wait till the inbox was full before I could try to make a call or text. OEM states to contact the manufacturer. I believe they sold me a phone that was not as advertised. If it was unlocked, I should have been able to use any SIM card."
1,Foreign phone without warranty,BE SURE TO READ THE FINE PRINT!!! These phones are not made for the US and therefore do not carry Motorola's one year warranty. I bought one and the keypad has stopped working. The phone is less than a year old so I called Motorola. They told me this phone was manufactured for the United Arab Emerates and there is no warranty coverage. The only option they gave was to buy a new phone with a 10% discount. Do not make the same mistake I did.
1,Broken in 10 days,"I bought the Razr V3 phone because my last phone (Sidekick) had a broken face. Normally, on a phone that has the face on the outside (Sidekick) it can break if you drop it, which happened to me. So I bought the V3 thinking that this wouldn't happen to a flip phone. Well, 10 days after buying it from Amazon, I closed the phone, only to realize when I reopened it that the face had cracked. I couldn't believe that Motorola would make such a flimsy face and charge so much for the phone. When I contacted the seller, they said they had a 10 day return policy and would not give me a new phone. I am now dealing with my insurance company to try and replace the V3. Overall, this has been a lousy experience that I will not repeat."
2,no so good.,"For the price and the company this is a rather dissapointing phone. Beautiful design, quite practical due to its size, good battery life but sound is not that good, buttons sometimes need to be pressed twice, camera is of quite poor quality and the memory space for the pictures is minimal. After a few months of owning it, I replaced with a different phone as I was getting fustrated especially with its buttons.I hope that motorola improves their future models."
4,RAZR=Good,I have no complaints about this phone. I have Cingular and to this point this is the only phone that gets reception in my house. I have had a great experience with this phone so far. I've had it for about 3 months.
3,Charger malfunction,"The phone I love but the charger is broke, I went to charge the phone and it would not charge and it has something rattling inside it so now i must get a new charger, which is disappointing."
1,I was sent the wrong Items!!!,"I was sent the wrong phone and the charger that came in the box does not even go to the phone I received!! I am in the middle of moving-otherwise I would have sent this back already! I had to go purchase a whole new phone that I really did not want just so I would have a phone. Since I had to wait to recieve this phone and then after sending it back I would have to wait longer for another phone; unfortunately this was not an option. If anyone does read this and cares, please send to my email address how to go about sending this item back- as this was my first time using Amazon. Thanks-"
3,Not great,"The only thing I really like about it is the fact that it slips easily into my back pocket.The worst thing about this phone is the battery life, or lack thereof. I get ONE phone call befor the battery dies. It's really ridiculous. Also, the buttons are not well designed - you have to look at them to dial because they are barely raised and don't line up on straight lines. I used to be able to just press the buttons without looking with my other phone - handy when driving.The button on the side that changes it to vibrate, alarm only, all off, etc., OFTEN changes itself. This is not good because you may think that it's on vibrate, when it's actually switched itself over to ""all off"" or ""alarm only."" I've missed some very important calls because of this - the phone just never rang.I don't think I'd buy it if I had it to do all over again."
1,Not As Advertised,"This is a nice phone and the deal on the unlocked version is good. BUT, it is supposed to come with ""European charger with US adapter"" After two tries Amazon could not send me one that actually had the US adapter in the box. Pretty hard to use the phone if you can't charge it."
1,The razor V3 is Junk!!!!!!!!!!!,"This phone is junk!!!! let it fall to the ground over 12"" and it will fall apart, let humidity get to it and it's done. If your an on the go person and want something dependable you want to look elsewhere. I woke up this morning and my phone was dead, number two in 90 days. V3 is junk!!!!"
1,bad phone,"this phone is horrible,i never write reviews but i just had to with this piece of junk.i am so angry at everything about this phone, the calls i have are constantly dropped, half the time i dont get calls at all and its not the service because my old phone had the same provider and it was not close to this bad.the battery is horrible, it dies in 4 hours on me even after i bought an extended one.i will try my best not to buy any motorola products because i am just amazed that they would put such a crappy product out.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,BUYER BEWARE,"I bought a black unlocked RAZR through Amazon, which was shipped from Tiger Direct. It works fine, but it was a European version. The AC charger plug was European with a US adapter. In the menu Personalize is spelled the English way ""Personalise."" I hope there are no other differences in the software."
1,No Warranty doesnt mean you throught it after one week,After 3 days i found there is something wrong in the screen where i see blak patch when screen is off. after one week the phone is silent and not responding. i thing this is very bad stuff. additional the sound quality is bad and camera is not good . this phone look like coming from botton of the ocean
1,This phone sucks!,It works well for a few months and then totally goes haywire and stops working. Would not recommend to anyone
4,"Great Phone, Great Look, Great $40 Price!!!","I think this is a good phone. I owned a Moto V551 and this is almost the sameexcept it lacks as much memory. This phone has some good skins, themes, features,and a huge screen. It's camera is great considering it's only a VGA. I owned aSony Ericsson T616 and that camera stunk, I'd take this one over my old Sony.It could use more memory but overall it's a pretty good phone, especially whenyou can get one for only $40. If you're interested email me at Gibsoncat320@aol.com,I'd be happy to help you out. There are better phones out there but this wasn'tmeant to be a ""Top of the Line"" phone. It's an awesome looking all metal phone,get one if you really want one!!!"
1,Never buy from this company again!!!!!,"I will never buy from this compnay EVER again. I called their toll free number as well as their local number and never got an answer. I was on hold for well over an hour. Also, you can not reach them via e-mail either. I checked their website for a link under contact us.... nothing. Never again will I buy from DataVision!!!!!!"
2,sucks,"few words only...bought the phone JUST for the looks!!!and its the only phone ive had since 2005, last one broke, as the software...the worst ive ever seen!!!likw its looks, buy it...want performance? well, look somewhere else!"
3,a good second phone,"I do a lot of international traveling and wanted a second phone to pop a foreign SIM card into (and still be able to use my first phone overseas at the same time.)I cannot imagine that there are many (or ANY) unlocked, quad band phones out there on the market for less money than this.Reception and call quality are both very good. The phone has a standard USB connector, but did not come with software for connecting to a computer. I have seen the software selling for almost no money -- so transferring phone numbers to the phone should be possible / easy.Mine came with a quick start guide in english and a full set of instructions in french. But, with intuitive menus and a reasonable interface I am not sure that a manual is really needed."
4,For the novice,Motorola has priced this phone at a very affordable price. This is an excellent GSM capable cellular phone to use before you upgrade to a higher moresophisticated cellular phone. A highly efficent cost friendly cellular phone from Motorola.
3,RAZR V3 Unlocked phone,The phone seems to function alright. The battery that came with the phone was no good within 3 weeks and had to be replaced. Could have just been a faulty battery but didn't last long. It is a UK phone so the symbols are different on the keypad of the phone. Also my blue tooth headpiece has background noise and a much less capable range than my previous V3 phone. Overall this purchase was middle of the road for me.
1,NOT HAPPY AT ALL,"I ordered this phone on te advise of my Grandaughter, she said it was a good phone from past experience. I am 70 yrs old and only wanted a phone that was easy to operate, say hello & goodbye, don't care about text or hardly anyother features. I got this phone in while out of town and my husband opened it and immediately threw away the order slip and packaging. When I arrived back home I tried to set the phone up. It only had a small quick reference guide in the package and now the battery will only stay charged 1/2 day. Can take battery out and put back in and it will show fully charged. Anyone got any answers to the problem since company it came from says no returns"
1,Bad phone,"I bought this motorola phone as a replacement for a defective phone that i bought a week earlier from amazon. I had the same phone before and i liked it that's why i ordered. This phone was for my mom to use back home. I received the delivery one day before her trip back to home, so i did not have the time to try it. It was again a bad phone: problem with the screen display that goes on and off without reason and a bad battery that lasts only 2 hours. I've a customer for amazon for a while, but my experience buying electronics frim them is really bad. AMAZON NEVER AGAIN. you ripped me off at least twice. Too bad that the phone is overseas now and it not even worth it to spend money to ship it to return it. Do not buy any phone from amazon. Period. This phones are not the same phone we have here in the US. I wish i could give -5 as a review."
3,Be careful - this is the European version!,"The RAZR itself is a great phone, however this unlocked version is designed for Europe. It has a European style AC charger, but does include an American adapter. I have T-Mobile service and this phone works with it, but I had one issue. Whenever I received an email it would send me a garbled text message. I was able to fix it by searching the internet, but it wasn't easy and I don't remember exactly what I had to do."
1,RAZR 3,"This phone was a European RAZR. I am on Cingular and you cannot link to the web on this phone regardless of what you hear. Also, none of the SIM card applications work because of this. The lack of web access really lessens the value of the phone.The phone itself works great -- great reception and great battery life."
1,Do not waste your money,"This phone is a piece of junk. The phone i received had AT&T logo on it. The phone feels like made from cheap material. I used to have the RAZR before and it was good. Believe me unless you want to waste your money and time, DO NOT buy this junk. I am sending this back today."
1,"Lost my money, no warrabnty and came with broken screen","I bougtht this phone to take to my country cause it was unlocked. But it did not work from day one because of a broken LCD, since it did not have any warranty I could not return it and the cost of repair was more than 200 USD.Just lost money here. My advise, never buy without warranty this phones come with many defects even from factory!!!!"
5,Great cellphone,"My dad's cellphone broke, so he wanted the same phone since he's used to the software of the phone and the phone itself. My dad loved the cellphone."
1,Quality worsened over the years (or fake product),"I previously had a Motorola Razr V3 and this definitely doesn't seem like the same product. The build quality of this one feels cheap (the battery compartment has a thin plastic sheet, buttons seem flimsy, the front lcd is a bit stained... and the overall sense is that it wasn't assembled well).Not to mention the 6 pages manual: my printer at home would've done a better job (which makes me really feel this is a fake product).Good news is that it turns on and seems to be working, but from the build quality, I don't think this will last too much. Just realized looking the reviews that the good reviews are really old -- all the new ones do state that this is a fake phone :(So, hoping that this will be seen by new buyers before buying this junk."
1,false advertising,"I went on Amazon looking for a ""CRICKET"" phone and the RAZR-3 cell phone advertised by ""Amazing deals"" was one of the phones that came up in the search.I liked the quality of MOTOROLLA and was looking for a flip-phone.I read all the details about the phone and no where inthe ad does it say this is a T-Mobile phone. So I bought the phone,recieved it in the mail and took it down to my local CRICKET storeand was informed that it could not be activated because it is not a CRICKET phone. I tried contacting the seller about their unwillingness to pay for the return.there response was that; the ad states the phone will not support a CDM network whatever that is.In PLAIN ENGLISH why not just say that this is a T-MOBILE phone. BUYER BEWARE"
3,cell phone,"I think this cell phone is not very good, just OK. Actually, my friend think this cell phone do not like a new one. I think it is just OK."
1,disappointed,This phone worked for 10 days..then it would shut off and 10th day..went dead/blank. Sent email to company but they would not honor as it was over 7 days...disappointed..wont purchase again...
3,Underwhelmed,"I bought these speakers based on the other reviews saying that you did not have to hook them up to an amplifier to have them sound good. I did not attain such results. My head unit has a 50 watt preamp on it, I guess I need more power to make these sound better."
3,Good until they blew!!,"had these paired with the pdx4 amp from alpine , supposedly a perfect match!! they blew after a few months, before that they sounded amazing. went to Boston acoustics pro series and a year later no issues, the amp still works great too. skip these and get the Boston pro series."
3,You truly get what you pay for,I bought this to practice so was not thoroughly disappointed because I know you get what you pay for and it was on the low end. The sight is definitely a toy and the crossbow is pretty much also although it does fire and works fine for the purpose I bought it for.
3,NvStar Crossbow,Its really not what i was looking for . the action is sloppy and it came with a broken compass.
1,Horrible Awful No Good Waste of Money,"I bought this bow as a Christmas gift for my nephew. One is arrived in a dirty, mangled box and the worst was it arrived BROKEN! Its true you get what you pay for this is cheap and a waste of money!!! It went stright to the trash!"
1,junk,Don't waste your money won't last two weeks or mine didn't even last a week wish I would have went on and spent the 79 and maybe I would still have one shot it like four or five times and that was it 0 stars
3,you get what you pay for,"It's a nice toy, stayed together well and was easy to assemble. Bolts do break easy, tips come off on impacted. It's a short ranges shooter. Thirty feet for good hit. It is worth the money at around thirty dollars but I wouldn't pay more."
1,the worst crossbow,this is a plane waste of money. DO NOT GET THIS ITEM. it is terrible quality. and again it is just a plane waste of money
1,junk,this product is absolute junk. I still have the red dot. It broke (being polite here) after firing a couple of bolts. Absolute junk. Save your money.
5,EXCELLENT CROSSBOW!!!!!!,"I have read the other comments and i do not know what they are talking about. This crossbow is awesome for fishing, target shooting, and hunting for small game. The other people probaly did not build it right. I would recommend this crossbow for anyone that wants to have fun. THIS CROSSBOW IS AWESOME!!!!"
1,This bow is junk,"Bought the bow, assembled it as shown. Extremely hard to cock, at just over 3/4 draw the right limb exploded.. JUNK"
1,Crap,"Just as with every product sold by NcStar, this crossbow is crap.This company should be banned from selling defective items on Amazon. This seller is garbage and so is their products.Second to 6th shot, this thing breaks. This is truly a piece of trash."
3,looks great,"This product looks great and powerful especially with this type of stock, but it is deceiving as it isn`t as it appears to be. Handles good because it is light, but am disappointed as to the way it shoots. Pretty good for very close targets...not nearly as good as the ones with out the rifle stock."
3,Mine was broken.,"My order shipped fast, but it had 3 major parts that were broken. I'm sure this was once awesome, but it's useless if it's broken. Oh, and to the idiots who couldn't figure out how to put it together, maybe you should finish your GED classes before you go shooting crossbows. In summary, I would have given this item 5 stars, if it wasn't broken."
3,Good for my son,"My son found this online and ordered it. It is ok. It is more a teenager's beginners crossbow. Dont get me wrong, this thing could really be dangerous if a irresponsible person or a child that didn't know any better got a hold of it. It suits our purpose."
1,NO HELP FROM THE SUPPLIER OR AMAZON / DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"I REQUESTED RETURN AUTHORIZATION ON THE 2 OF JAN AND HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANYONE ON THIS.THE UNITS I RECEIVED WERE JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND CONFIGURATION THAT I HAD HOPED FOR , BUTTHEY WILL NOT COCK AND HOLD THE STRING. THEY ARE PRETTY WELL WORTHLESS. GRANDKIDS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED."
4,No instructions?,This crossbow was kinda tough to put together seeing as how there were not detailed instructions but once I figured it out I was blasting the target s in no time.
2,Eh...,"The crossbow comes with alot of nice things... but the build quality is ""meh"" and as far as power goes... its not... at 60 feet the bolts bounce out of an old RV door while my cobra x-bow buries them all an inch deep at least the accessories will go nice with my cobra the problem is that the way the bow is mounted, the string drags along the shaft so severeley that it robs alot of the power, that, and the cocking mechanism isnt always... locking"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I shot one arrow with no problems. Then, shot a second... It completely broke in half! I goudged the living heck out of my pinkey finger (I will be okay)!! I cannot believe that something like this is so UNSAFE, POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP, I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS EVER!!!"
1,broke,Broke the first time I cocked it. Assembly instructions non-existent. One star is an over rating.
3,It is what it is for the price. Fun in the backyard.,ok for price good for backyard fun. not a kids toy could hurt someone. but for the price. its okay.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I am experienced with crossbows, and I recently purchased this crossbow as a fun small bow to play with out in the backyard. Well, that never happened. The assembly was terrible. I dry fired (no bolt) this a few times and determined that it was not safe enough to put a bolt in to fire.I would recommend that you get a cobra brand 80lb crossbow if you are looking for a small pistol sized self cocking crossbow. They are much better made.80 Lbs Self-Cocking Crossbow Pistol."
2,50lbs,it is cheap made range is only 15-20 feet. Great indoor use but sucks outside. cables fatigue very easy. noisiest crossbow i have ever seen.
4,Good for a cheap crossbow,"This was a nice cheap ""toy"" crossbow. While it is not a toy, I call it a toy because it is far from a real crossbow power. It was easy to assemble even without instructions. Id guess maybe around 40lb of draw. Not too much power, but nice for target practice between 30 anf 45 feet."
3,Not exactly on par with the review book by the same authors,"Well, frankly, i dont like this book AT ALL. THE PRACTICE TESTS ARE NOTHING LIKE THE REAL ONES BY ETS. It's funny with the CR section where the right answer stands out like a magic ball among a bunch of OBVIOUSLY dumb choices. You bet you can never find such thing in a real SAT.In a nutshell:DONT BUY IT. trust me...If you want cruise through the same frustration and regret i have using this book, go ahead and buy it."
3,Rx for Dogs,"Finally, a useful book for the layman.I was very disappointed in the layout (editing) of the book. The reader must fumble through the book to find tables for medications to treat various conditions. The medical advice is sound and very useful. Revamp the book with an index that is usable."
4,God information,This should be on every pet owners bookshelf. It's a fairly cheap looking paperback but the information is useful.
2,"Works great for a few times, then cracks.","This injector works great for a few times, but then cracks, not allowing you to suck-up the marinade or inject it. This was only hand-washed after every use. Don't waste your money on it; you will pull it out to use it, and will not be able to when you need it [like when you have that big turkey sitting on the counter, and find the injector unusable]. The acrylic body needs to be redesigned and manufactured with another, more durable material, then it would be absolutely great."
5,best quality injector,I have to say I was very happy with the quality of this product. I guess I was expecting a little less durable needle and plastic. I have used it quite a bit with my rotisserie oven. The price was reasonable as well.
1,"Works good but not for long, plastic cracks easily","The injector worked great when I got it. Since the body is made of plastic, it cracked after about a year and rendering it useless. I only used it twice. I DO NOT recommend this product."
1,Disposable marinade injector?,"To make a long story short, it stopped being functional after 6 months. As stated in other reviews, the union between the plastic and metal needle attachment breaks down and leaks very fast. Maybe it is modeled after disposable injectors? Anyway, if you are short on cash, and plan to use it few times, and throw it away, maybe it is Ok, for the regular user go buy a steel one as i did."
1,worst product ever,"FFirst time I used this product the needle separated from where it screws into the injector. I called the numb on the barrel and they said they couldn't help me bc ""we don't support all Bruce's products"". I'll never own a Cajun Injector product again."
1,Please... don't waste your money!,"Deluxe?? I would hate to see the non-deluxe version! Just two injections into my greatly anticipated New Year's ham... and it broke!! I directly contacted the manufacturer numerous times, but got no response. If you want to use the injection method of cooking (and I highly recommend it), spend a little more money and get a truly deluxe model (i.e., non-plastic).""Chef Williams"" marinade products are fabulous, but the company should be ashamed ot themselves for trying to pass off this injector as a ""quality"" product. If you try to use this injector you will probably never know how good the injection method can be!One last word of warning... Should you still decide to purchase this product, please be sure you have anternate game plan. Trust me, most injectable marinades are only good IF they are actually injected!!"
5,Very Quick Marinade,"At first, I wasn't too sure about injecting marinade instead of soaking it, I soon found the Chef Williams injector on amazon and gave it a chance. I was delighted, it works quickly and evenly because of the 2 holes in opposite directions. I have used it many times now, and it seems to hold up nicely! Great product!"
1,Don't buy it!!!!,The injector worked great the first couple of times I used it however over time the plastic body developed cracks in the base where the needle threads in. From that point forward the injector would only suck air. I eventually had to throw it out.
1,Mine broke after limited use,"I must agree with the other negative reviewer. I used mine only to inject flavorings into CAKES-not a harder substance like raw beef or chicken-and it broke in 2 places after only 3 uses. And if you are using a thinner liquid as opposed to a thick marinade or sauce, the liquid simply pours out of the holes before you have a chance to inject it. Don't waste your money."
1,My Plastic Cylinder Cracked...,"...and so here I am examining this product category on Amazon and finding out that my experience is by no means unique.My cracked injector draws some small fraction of an ounce of water now, but none of the herbed oil I prepared with olive oil, paprika, garlic granules, ginger powder, and Himalayan salt."
1,Piece of junk - do not buy,"After using it once and washing it, I saw the plastic cylindrical tube that holds the injection liquid was shattered/cracked. No longer safe to use with food. I tried calling the manufacturer to get a replacement, and they do not support this product. It is a piece of junk. Do not buy it."
1,One word- POOP!,"I didn't buy this on Amazon but I found it here because I was searching for a new one to replace this exact model which I purchased at a kitchen store. The way it's designed with the curved handle on the plunger caused it to break off in mid-injection during the second use because it's impossible not to put more pressure on the raised side of the handle. By adding an ""ergonomic"" handle, someone tried fixing something that wasn't broken."
2,Cracked Cylinder Blues,"I'm going to throw my lot in with the people who are not recommending this product. It's the perfect size and just what I wanted. I give it two stars because when it was working, it was exactly what I wanted. It's small enough that you can get good targeted injections, unlike some of the huge stainless ones. However, the plastic cracked after just a few months rendering it useless. I don't know about you, but I prefer things to last at least a bit longer than a few months. I didn't even use it more than two or three times. Complete junk."
1,Cajun Injector Deluxe Marinade Injector,I ordered this product hoping to use it for poultry. My first and last attempt was a complete failure. The Injector would not draw the marinade up the tube. I poured some marinade directly into the tube and it would not come out.I have returned my original Injector and am currently waiting for a replacement.
2,Loved it until cylinder cracked,"I used my Cajun Marinade Injector a total of maybe a dozen times and it really did do a great job.... until I went to use it the other day only to have marinade squirt all over through a crack in the plastic cylinder. Disappointing to say the least. I gave it two stars because before it broke, it worked great. Having read multiple reviews citing the same problem, I know now that the cylinder failure I experienced is a common problem with this model. I was happy enough with the injector performance that I'll consider spending the extra $10 to get the model with a metal cylinder."
1,Didn't Last One Day,"I knew this product was a cheaper than other flavor injectors but believed I was getting a great deal. Instead I got a product that cracked on the first day of use. Disappointing, don't waste your money. I would definitely recommend getting one of the more expensive injectors so you don't have the same problem."
3,"Nice, but..","It's a nice flask. Except that when I received mine, the glue which binds the leather to the flask was already coming undone. Not the best craftmanship for the price."
2,The Passion of the Chrysler,"I remember seeing a trailer for this in the movie theater a year ago... and then it never showed up and made a quiet appearance on the video store shelves. Never a good sign. Still, the trailer looked interesting to me, and I'm a fan of the road horror movies like ""The Hitcher"" and ""Joyride"", so I decided to give this one a spin.I should have stuck to just watching the trailer, since it actually shows the only good part of the movie, where the evil car latches a steel hook to this poor girl's vehicle and drags it down the street at 60 with her trapped inside.I wanted this to be better. It had a flicker of ingenuity, and then it just died. If you're looking for a creepy road movie on Amazon that you can pick up for cheap, I suggest ""Dead End"" before this one."
2,Highway men made for one bored one woman,"Highway men, a movie that seemingly promises action and adventure fell short and felt more forced than thrilling. Caviezel played the role as well as I guess that he could have but the movie's plot seemed to have had major flaws as to why no one ever questioned his sudden opperance on crime scenes and it didn't have enough small conflicts to build to it's final climax. There is no sense of closure in the character in tne ending. The deranged automotive driven maniac is very similar to paced movies such as Joy Ride or Duel the exception of the emotional and revengeful sentiment that it entails. Highway Men isn't the sort of fil that you want to rent if you inviting over friends who are thrill seekers but is more appropriate for cozy nights when you happen to browse over it on cable TV."
3,"Worthy entry into the ""DUEL SUB-GENRE""","Like it's cinematic great-grandaddy, DUEL, this movie sets up a simple premise, then proceeds to milk it for all it's worth. The performances were very good, but it's a shame that an actor of the stature of Colm Feore was so underused. Catch him in ""Storm of the Century"" to see how well he can deliver the goods when featured more prominently.This is a movie that doesn't strive as much for depth as it does mood, its sole ambition to be a brooding horror-psychodrama road-trip. Director Harmon shapes this piece into just the kind of moody vehicle (pardon the pun) that fans of this type of fare will enjoy.Take it for a spin."
4,i enjoyed this movie,"intriguing movie, the driving stunts were realistic and leaves one on the edge of seat. there are some sweet tender moments between the main male and female characters. as well scenes of understanding for survivors of accidents. a very descent movie."
4,Great Movie,"This movie isn't going to win awards by any means, but it was pretty entertaining. Being a fan of Jim Caviziel I had to watch it! He always stands out in all of his performances. The plot had no holes, but you knew how it was going to end after watching the first ten minutes. *SPOILER* I really don't think the guy needed to be 85% machine that was driving the other car, it wasn't needed. The action was great. I'd watch it again, and recommend it to other people, but its not on my top ten movies."
3,Ok movie...Loved James Caviezel,"I did not enjoy this movie as much as I did Count of Monte Cristo. Does like James Caviezel's acting!! It felt to dreary or something, I cant place my thoughts on the subject. Anyhow, but will not return just add to collection of other DVDs."
2,A Poor Day's Work,"Robert Harmon directed the very solid Jesse Stone adaptations. Jim Caviezel and Rhona Mitra are attractive actors. So 'Highwaymen' had potential. But it is not a good movie.Surely they started filming with more than an eighty-minute script. What happened? Would the missing scenes fill in some of the plot holes? As other reviewers have noted, what we're left with is a poorly-stitched composite of movies like 'Duel' and 'Joy Ride'.It lacks character development, credible detective work, logic, and good dialog. The villain should have been gross, filthy, demented, and terrifying -- but he looks like a middle-aged Hollywood actor who just had a salon facial and an eighty-dollar haircut."
3,"Predictable, derivative, formulaic and, despite that, enjoyable","This movie is a blend of ""Switchback,"" ""The Hitcher,"" ""Duel,"" ""Mad Max,"" ""Joy Ride"" and a variety of other car-chase, man-against-man, serial-killer, vengeance movies. Knowing that going in, you shouldn't be surprised at the result. Keep your expectations low when you put the movie in and you just might enjoy the ride. I did."
3,"""There's A Lot Of Me Still In That Car ~ Separating The Mind From The Machine""","In the tradition of the '71 made-for-television classic `Duel', `Joy Ride' from `01 and numerous other road rage genre films the '04 film `Highwaymen' is a not too original but overall entertaining exercise in persistence, vengeance and the always enjoyable subject matter of vigilante justice.The strongest draw to this movie is in the presence of James Caviezel and the stunning Rhona Mitraspect in the lead roles of two strangers thrown together on the California highways, one pursuing, the other begin pursued by a maniacal serial killer who wields his car as a weapon of destruction.Conversely the main weaknesses I perceive in this production are; the lack of originality in the storyline and the fact that most of the car chase sequences take place in the darkness of night limiting the audience ability to visually partake in the full cinematic experience.My Rating: Well worth at least one watch; -3 1/2 Stars-."
3,Get it straight,"First and foremost the car is a Barracuda. That being said I really liked this movie. And as for ripping off Mad Max I don't feel the movie did that either. This is a serial killer planning his crimes, seeking revenge. The only problem I had with the movie was it felt to short. Look forward to owning this DVD as I really like the chase scenes and the ending.3 of 5 stars for me."
4,Most Enjoyable,"I bought this cd because, I'll admit, I am a big Ioan Gruffudd fan. I loved this movie, so, of course, I had to have the soundtrack! It has proved to be a great addition to my cd collection in it's own right.The album tells the story of Great Expectations quite well. Each song is from a specific scene or moment that brings us through the story.The music itself is highly symbolic--with different sounds and melodies reminding us of the pasts our characters cannot escape. The liner notes by the composer are fascinating. He describes the symbolic meanings and threads of each different melody/theme.There are several quite brilliant moments. Of note are, ""Pip Becomes a Gentleman"", ""Gentlemen on the River"", and ""The Last Moments of Magwitch"".I have not taken this cd out of my cd player since it arrived. I would highly reccomend it to anyone with an ear for beautiful and unusual music. You won't be dissappointed!"
1,Not the Iowa State fight song,"This product is not the Iowa State University fight song, it is the fight song of University of Iowa. There is a difference between the two universities, just ask any football fan or alum. My husband was kind enough to tell me this was not correct before I placed them in the stuffed animals I made as Christmas presents for a few Cyclone fans."
3,Not As Much Taste,"I bought this tea for my husband since I learned that pineapple can open up the breathing passages. He drank it, however, I would rather get pineapple juice and pour it in the cup of tea. I did not get much of a pineapple taste to it. I will not order again."
2,poor excuse for pineapple tea,"This tea does not taste at all like pineapple. I have had pineapple tea before and found this to be very disappointing -- this tasted like your basic orange pekoe blend.The seller did ship the item right away (at a cost more than the product) so it was good service in that respect; however, the product was not one that I would recommend."
5,I love Tracy Lawrence!,Tracy should be rewarded by his fans for his excellent music. Everything he has ever done is great. He is one of a few artists that I rush out to by his cd's and I have never been disappointed. If you think this one is good just wait until you hear Lessons Learned. It is incredible!
5,Tracy Lawrence should be one of the superstars,"After listening to this cd, it's hard to believe that Tracy Lawrence isn't one of the most popular country singers today. This album is flawless and all the songs except for the unreleased song are hits. It has all of Tracy Lawrence's hits from ""Time Marches On"" to the new hit, ""While You Sleep."" Even the unreleased ""Her Old Stompin' Ground"" is a good song. These are some of my favorite country songs and Tracy Lawrence might not be one of the most popular country singers, but he's one of the best in my book.If you like country music at all, take this cd for a spin."
5,Everything I wanted and more!!!,This cd came without any flaws. It never skips and came with the case and everything in it. I'm definitely going to buy more things from these people!!!!! It's like I bought it new from the store!
5,Excellent for beginners,"I read this book because I was interested in switching from speed walking which I have done for the past year and a half. I was having trouble with breathing, and got easily discouraged. The information in this book has helped me set up a program that is easy on my body, and possible. I also really enjoyed the fact that he addressed the issue of the psychology of running. I often catch myself now telling myself it isn't possible and realize how much I have hampered my own progress. I rented this book from the library, but it has so much information I can use over and over, that it's worth buying."
5,This guy is great!,"I buy this book for other runners, or people thinking of getting into running. I have been a runner for 30 years. I wish I had read this when I was in High School. It would have made me a better runner if I did."
2,poor condition Amazon verified purchase,The book arrived with all the pages wavy. It was a purchase of a new book.It appeared to have moisture damage. Amazon did not respond to my complant
5,A MUST-HAVE book for runners,"I was advised to follow Jeff Galloway by my doctor after a running-related injury earlier this year. I borrowed the book from the local library, thinking I would browse thru it and return it. By the time I read the first 20-something pages, I was convinced I wanted to own this book.This book has great coverage of everything from climatic condition tips, to age-specific recommendations, pacing to racing, interesting anecdotes to scientific analysis of how your body behaves in response to stress and rest.A must-have for anybody contemplating running as an exercise or as a racer."
5,Galloway's book on running 2nd edition,"This is an excellent book for runners of all abilities,it is the runnersbible."
5,Distinctive and practical advice for runners who have a life,I used Galloway's advice to comfortably run the Portland (OR) marathon three times. The concepts and suggested training schedules are unlike other plans presented elsewhere but they make eminent sense: if you want to run 26.2 miles you need to build your longest runs (every two weeks) to distances very close to that. But you don't need high weekly mileage. This book is full of sound information and is unique in many ways for those who wish to train for the marathon distance and survive the training without injury to body or family time. I did not experience any significant performance drop-off after the 20 mile mark in any of my marathons. I hope to use the program again for the 1999 Portland Marathon. (Fred Delgado)
5,Great book for runner,"I thought this book was a great resource for an untrained runner like myself. Jeff Galloway explains what happens physiologically when you run, how to improve form, improve speed, keep motivated, and specifics on how to train for a 5k, 10k, and half marathon."
4,"Good book, not edition I was looking for","This book is actually really insightful and I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I was purchasing it so I could get the training program. The training program wasn't a part of this book as they've removed it from the 2nd edition. Pretty disappointed."
2,Not My Thing...,"I bought this cd hoping to hear some old Jamaican mento, the root of reggae. I have always had a thing for classic mento, often mislabeled calypso, by ignorant non-West Indians. On this cd Teddy Greaves does play some mento but he does it in a style so tame that it is obvious that he is trying to make the songs acceptable to an audience which prefers easy listening to the raw, often naughty tunes so typical of old style Jamaican music.I would file this under easy listening and for those who like that sort of thing, Mr. Greaves might be o.k. He does have a good voice, but so does Neil Diamond. If you like Neil, you could like this, but for anyone looking for Jamaican roots, get everything you can by the Jolly Boys who play authentic mento rather than tame, watered down music for elderly tourists"
4,This book helped my four-year old.,"My 4-year-old son is very bright and imaginative, but has a hard time focusing on tasks -- as a result, his small-motor skills were beginning to lag behind. This workbook helped him develop skills in drawing shapes, solving puzzles, and beginning to write letters.The workbook has bright pictures and a variety of actitivies. Parents (or kids) can choose to skip around the book if the child gets tired of one kind of activity. We chose to work straight through, stopping whenever he got tired or frustrated. The activities are challenging but not impossible.One caveat -- are preschoolers really expected to know how to write the alphabet in upper and lower case? They learn how in this book, but I seem to remember taking that up in the first grade, oh a million or so years ago."
2,Not the Same As Before,"I originally bought this 6 months ago for my son. It was just the right level of challenging for him. It included writing, matching first sounds to pictures. It also had a several mazes and other fun things. We moved and the book didn't make the trip so I ordered it again. They have completely changed it and the material is very simple. Half the book is now mazes which of course my son loves but are not really educational in the slightest. If you are just looking for fun worksheets this is fine but if you want any kind of educational material I would skip this one completely. There are many other better ones on the market including the one they sell at Wal-mart."
5,Wonderful teaching companion,Everything I was looking for to teach my 3 year old how to write her letters and numbers. With plenty of other learing activites. All in all a wonderful pre-school work book! I also purchased the Brain Quest pre-shool work book but definitly prefer this one.
5,Very useful,"My son, aged 4, finds the activities of this book very interesting.He uses this book to do his 'homework' while older brothers are working in their homework too!"
3,Also check out...[...],Great Book....My preschooler also loved this set of books . The colorful pages and graphics were easy for her to follow..she also loves the Fun Workbooks for Prescool and Kindergarten kids at the below link![...]
3,a bit too easy / but enjoyable and bright,"My daughter just turned 4 last month. This book was exciting for her because of the bright pictures and quality; however, the content was WAY TOO EASY for her. Simple line tracing and coloring... picking out which picture is different from the other two... She whipped through each page in moments.Good for self esteem I suppose. I prefer the Brain Quest Pre-K workbook though... it's a bit more advanced."
4,Lots of pages to work with,"There are lots of great workbook pages. They are able to be torn out. The ages seem to be a bit off. My daughter is 3 and some of these are just too hard for her. She is able to write all her letters and numbers, but the connecting the dots and some of the other activities are too advanced. I guess we'll just have to space out the lessons or get another book to supplement for now."
5,Excellent,"My son loves activity books!! I try to get them in stores, but I can't. The product is like new."
4,great supplemental teaching tool,"I have been using this workbook with my 3 year old on days she doesn't go to preschool. They have some great activities, however I would suggest ripping the pages out because the book is so thick it makes it difficult to lay the pages out flat and get them to write or draw correctly. Some of the activities are way too easy but many of them are challenging."
3,Great material for preschool aged children,This book was used and did have some writing in it but not on every page. I still can use this to our advantage and glad we ordered it. It was packaged properly and its education value is everything I expected and more.
2,Big Preschool Workbook,I bought this for my grandson and was disappointed with how little work really exists. Some of the exercises are good but many are page fillers
2,Waste of money,Only buy this if you own a copier or you plan on buying a copier or even multiple copies of this book. This book us a random compilation of activities that didnt teach my preschooler anything.
1,Poor quality,This product should have been listed under poor because most of the pages were already done by circling pictures. Also I paid way more than I should have because the book had a sticker on it showing they bought it from Walmart for 4.00. I will not use this company ever again.
4,This has a hard time standing alone,"I would recommend this book as a supplement to Korczak's biography or Holocaust literature in general. It has a hard time standing on its own. Part memoirs and part diary, most of the entries are undated and very sketchy, and it's hard to tell what really happened and what is creative fiction on Korczak's part. He was very busy and in poor health at the time of writing and much of his diary was basically shorthand which he planned to expand upon later, but he died before he could do so.That said, if you've readThe King of Children: The Life and Death of Janusz Korczakand want to get an even closer look at the man, you should read Korczak's ghetto diary. His preoccupations as the Warsaw ghetto is being ground to dust make heavy food for thought."
4,Very pleased with purchase.,"Overall they are very good nested dumbells, especially when compared to more expensive ones. The weight adjusts easily and they are very well balanced; better than fixed dumbells. My only complaint was that after receiving them I found on their warranty card that the manufacturer also offers a 60# dumbell. The 40# was the only one advertised. Other than that I would highly recommend them to anyone considering dumbells."
1,Bad seller,Don't buy from Hot Rod Girl. No Product. No Response. In-box is full. Working through Amazon to obtain refund. Would give zero stars if option existed.
3,Not just a kid's book.,"I like these kinds of books because they pack in a whole lot of general information and have lots of good graphics. In contrast, many ""adult"" books are too wordy, too detailed, have lousy indexes and TOCs, way too few pictures, and describe the author's adventures more than the supposed subject. The main fault I found with this book is that some of the information seems out of order and some of the graphics could be improved. But hey, I checked this out of the library, and it was good enough to buy."
4,"Second edition of a standard, popular title on dinosaurs","In comparing the second edition with the 1993 edition, I found updated information on Ankylosaurus, Argentinosarus, and Oviraptor. Otherwise, the book appears unchanged. Unfortunately, the index citation to Oviraptor was not changed in the new edition, so is incorrect."
1,only for the simple mind,This book is a good book for your kids is if they are interested in dinosaurs. The age group I'd put on this book is 8-12yrs old. The text is to simple for anyone over the age of 12 to enjoy. It doesn't take you very in depth with each period in which the dinosaurs. And it is all in evolution time. So I should have said 8-12yr old atheist. I would not recommend it.Daniel C. age 15 3/4
3,Fun Runs Out Quickly,"This is NOT a long-term game. The levels (depsite being ""easy"", ""medium"" or ""hard"") are either riduculously simple or painfully difficult. For any child over 5 or 6, it will loose it's appeal VERY quickly.The only long-term fun is to see how many tickets can be collected, but the rewards for collecting tickets (the water slide) is probably the most boring game on it. As a mom, I can say that this was not a game I would have bought if we had tested it first."
1,WARNING- NOT Authentic CLASSIC ALBUMS series,"I feel totally ripped off by Amazon for listing this to make it look like it's part of the Classic Albums series. THAT series features interviews with actual band members, producers and fellow musicians. THIS DVD is part of a series featuring a disclaimer indicating, ""This film is unauthorised and is not associated or approved in any way by present and past members of Green Day...""."
2,Nirvana Footage?,"This has some very unprofessional production moments. Thru much of the narration they actually have Nirvana footage playing, but it's chopped up and blurry. The little footage of Green Day is often repeated during these narrations. Maybe the cheap production makes it more 'punk'."
5,Roux Porosity Control Conditioner 15oz.,"Rare product to find in Southern California, but you had it in STOCK. Also, you sent it to me in a timely manner! Most EXCELLENT Service!!!"
1,"I have not seen such a garbage book in my whole life, so far",Please save your hard earned money and don't buy this book. Instead buy Master Del Pe's books. Hidden dangers of meditation by Del Pe is the first step towards spirituality.Give yourself a favor and don't read other's review on this book.
4,interesting,"I heard about this book from a guy who attended a seminar held in Zagreb by author's school. He told me that, following the exercises in the book, you can attain the same results he had in the seminar. The book itself is really interesting, full of various techniques, however i relized for half of the exercises i cannot be sure if i'd done them right. Throat friction, the most basic techinique all else is based on, for instance. In order to know how it is done properly, and if i am doing it right, i would need to HEAR it. I found that most frustrating, so i finished reading the book without really doing the exercises. Therefore i cannot tell you if it works or not. Full of very interesting views and theories thou."
2,"Yeah, I read it.","When it came out, I actually was a student at St. Johns College. Imagine reading a book about a murder mystery in Washington, D.C., only to find out it takes place in Seattle, Washington. Transplanting the Washington Monument for the Space Needle: a little out of place.Character development assumed the reader was already familiar with the players; they were over-developed by the second page. The writer misinterpreted depictions of life in the College as from a hastily-written travel brochure. I have read worse books since, but this was memorable.I did finish the book and return it to the person from whom I had borrowed it. Then I strolled through 'Nap-town and took a burger at the BK Lounge to ease my pain.Even after 30 years, I want that read-time back. Too bad Mr. Campbell died on '02, he might have been able to rebut this review."
1,misrepresentation in basic title description,"This injector clearly states it is a ""Stainless Steel Marinade Injector"". But no, it is consctructed of nickel plated brass. Very disappointing."
2,"good, but dull tip.","W\It seems well made, and comes with spare gaskets. However, the tip is rounded, not sharp, and you'll have to use a skewer or something else sharp to make your holes in tougher cuts. When I tried to sharpen the tip, I found out it's pressed in and I had ground its crimp right off. That was the end of this one."
2,"Rounded, dull tip","Very dull, rounded tip, so I decided to go to work with my grinder to give it a sharp point. Mistake !! It is hollow all the way to the end of the tip, so now I have an injector with an open ended needle, rather than a sharp point. Now in the trash, and I wouldn't buy again. Shame, because it did seem to be well made, but definitely needs a sharper point."
4,Chicago underworld before Capone,"This is a lively history of the Chicago underworld--the brothels, red-light districts, gambling joints, etc.--from the mid-1800s up to the Capone years. Well written and informative."
2,Somewhat Boring!,This book was written more in the form of a textbook than a novel. It contains factual information but is neither suspenseful nor very interesting. It may have been good for its time but is now dull
3,essential but slow,"All of the Adrian Mole diaries are essential to the whole. Some are a bit harder to get through than others. This is one of the less ""action packed"" but still enjoyable. (Pick up a later diary and you'll realize you need to read it.) Save it for a rainy day read but read it."
4,Adrian Mole returns,"I grew up on Adrian Mole. Everything he has gone through, I have gone through too, which in itself says alot about me *shudder at the thought*.Adrian our clueless hero finds himself again in the twist of his past. He bungles through his 30s in the most 'uptight, starched shirt' sort of way, which provides humour unlikely any other.My fave part of the book is when Sue Townsend takes on Helen Fielding's Bridget Jones. It has me in stiches. If you fancy a good ticke to the funny bone, this book is for you."
4,Adrian Mole.. he's 30 1/4 with the mentality of a 15 yr old.,"Never read this book without reading the first few books. If not, you can't exactly get he's going through. His family's dysfunctional than ever, with a depressed dad, a desperate mum, and a loud-mouth sister half his age. The wit and humor is like that of the first book (Secret Diary Of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 3/4). He still has the teenage mentality even though he's 30 and has children. I found myself laughing with him. Least he doesn't sign his letters with ""A. Mole"" anymore, instead it's ""A.A. Mole""."
2,Getting tired of Adrian Mole,"I really wish more nice things would happen to Adrian Mole. I think he deserves it. It's as if Sue Townsend lies awake at night thinking of new ways to make Adrian miserable. I suppose if he were happy, it wouldn't make much of a book, but I'm quite tired of the 'wingeing.'"
2,A good tea but not packaged well.,A good tea--probably--but not packaged well enough to retain its flavor. Just sort of thrown into a wax bag. Flavor was weak by the time I got it!
2,A good first attempt.,"The recipies are interesting, and many show creativity. Many of them are also simple and quick to make. The book would have benefitted greatly from photographs to illustrate some of the ideas that Mrs. Cooksey describes for presentation, and also as a quick reference. There were an unusual number of typos, but the book is well organized, and the recipies are well laid out. This cookbook would be a good gift for a person new to cooking, but does not offer a great deal for the kitchen veteran."
4,"Practical, common sense advice","For a high-handicapper like myself, I certainly benefited from reading this book. It's an easy read and gives some practical advice on how to shave some shots off your game. Most of the advice given in the book is common sense - there are a lot of ""That seems obvious, why didn't I think of that"" moments. But what I like about Rotella's writing style is the way he conveys these nuggets of wisdom through examples and stories. Nothing here will help you with the technical aspects of your golf game. But it will certainly help you with the mental aspects. E.g. one shot at a time; stay in the moment; take dead aim; conservative line, arrogant swing etc. Looking forward to taking some of this advice to the course."
2,"""Fore"" is between your ears","Nothing really earth shattering here but the book does provide a different perspective for any competitor. ""Operative words here""....Golf is a game"
3,It is ok,"Book is ok. Basically work on your confidence, mental conversations, fear control, practice short game...... and 'viola', better golf.... I'd recommend the Pelz 100 yard Bible if you are interested in taking the author's advise on short game. Great wedge system which gets better every year you practice and use it.....Oh, and buy a laser range finder for the practice sessions...."
4,Good approach to mental side of golf,"Rotella's book shows the golfer how to mentally approach the game of golf. He gives examples on how to play better golf just by changing your thought pattern. It is fun to read but don't expect to shoot par by just using this book. For golf fitness, I recommend, ""Fit for Golf""-it came out in 2004, it has good pictures on how to perform certain strength training machines. For learning how to actually shoot par, I definitely recommend: ""The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better"" by Patrick Leonardiisbn 1933023090Leonardi's book showed me with easy to follow instruction on how to play par golf. My golf shots now go straight to the middle of the green and I am now hitting more fairways then ever. Now when I play golf, I'm much more excited and motivated to keep practicing because now I see results."
4,Comparative,"I just finished reading Different Strokes, by Mona Vold, and picked up Doc's book because a guy golfer friend of mine recommended it (& he's reading Vold's book). The original Ladies pros/teachers and Vold's narrative gave me a far greater appreciation of golf as a quest versus golf as a past time. I like Doc's premise re perfection, but...well, I recommend you check out Vold's book..."
1,Great disappointment,"This book consists of a lot of name dropping and stories from the world of golfing greats. In the appendix section Dr. Bob Rotella sums up all his golf wisdom in four pages. Reading these pages you get all the information Dr. Bob Rotella has to offer.For the average bogey golfer ""Golf is not a game of perfect"" prescribes working on her short game. From my analysis a lot of bogey golfers lack length to be able to shoot greens in regulation. Most of them eliminated double bogeys by working on their short game. For these players this book is no help at all.I rated this book with one star and not with zero because Dr. Bob Rotella gives one great advice: create and stick to your pre-shot routine."
4,Mental aspect of game,This book develops the mental aspect of this wonderful sport. Some tips come naturally but it does no harm (and it actually is quite helpful) to read the once in a while.
4,Golf is Not a Game of Perfect,"Well worth the reading. Common themes that help focus on the essentials, allowing it to sink in. Most of these type of books generally raise the awareness of common sense like focus on the target, etc. This book provides good testimonials, examples, etc. to bring home the real purpose. Easy to read. Though I haven't put it to practice yet, I know it will help my game. Already picked up his other book on putting."
5,The Missing Link for My Game,"I picked this book up at a local bookstore while browsing and was quickly intrigued. I had been struggling to break 80 lately, since I don't get to play golf as much I'd like. Usually no more than once a week. I had been practicing more, thinking working on my mechanics, etc. would help me improve, but to no avail. After reading this book, it changed my philosophy on how I approach my practices and rounds. I'm now much more relaxed and focused and now 'trust' my swing. I especially liked his thoughts on putting and the importance of working on your inside 120 yards game. Since finishing the book, my last 5 rounds have been 78, 79, 78, 77, and 76. Heading in the right direction!"
4,"Super book, although it screwed up my putting completely","Target Golf is what this one is all about and it works wonders. Always have a target and always think target, ball, contact. Dr. Bob advocates a pure-feel approach to putting which when I tried it messed up my putting something awful. But that's just me. That's the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me."
5,Best book ever about improving your enjoyment & game,"I have read approximately 25 golf books and instructional books on golf. Some books are very good, good, fair and poor, partially based on the game level of the reader. This book is a GREAT, GREAT book. In fact it is the best golf improvement book I have ever seen. I believe it is not simply because it matches my skill level, but because it truly applies to most skill levels. The only negative about this book, I was wanting more when it was finished. I have read two other books by Rotella and they are very good also, but this book is the best. Waiting for more!"
1,not perfect,A big help to me in my game . The biggest help i got from another of rotellas books directly with putting and as a result i have never seen so many birdies in a round due directly to the said two books.
4,Pretty close to reality,"Drinking and drugging are the only way of life for the affluent teens and 20s in this almost true-crime drama. The big surprise is the high quality of Justin Timberlake's acting here as the accomplice to a kidnapping that goes all wrong. Great soundtrack. The 'big stars,' i.e. Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone play parents, but they don't have a lot to do. The kids are the most riveting here, and the limited vocabulary they employ is very close to real. This is highly watchable."
5,Disturbing but a great true story,The fact that the story is true makes the movie more disturbing. Actually a great film in HD. The visuals are great and the story and acting is very good. The lead character is a wimpy coward and Timberlake plays it well.The Combo HD DVD is a great deal and a good addition to your HD collection.
3,Alpha Dog,"Johnny is a Los Angeles drug dealer. He comes from a good family, owns his home, several cars and enjoys partying with his friends. Johnny is 19. When his friend Jake welches on a debt, Johnny and his boys kidnap Jake's 15-year-old brother Butch and hold him as a marker. Even though Butch has numerous chances to escape, he doesn't. He's enjoying partying with them, losing his virginity and having a good time - until something goes horribly wrong. Justin Timberlake is very good as Frankie. A gritty, gut-wrenching and disturbing movie."
3,Exploiting underage stupidity,"Either it is a technical problem or initial producers' idea, substituting actions with sounds in darkness hardly leads to the better comprehending of a mix of scenes oversaturated with a quest for copulating and drugs while kidnapping and killing younger 15 y.o. half-brother of an addict short of money to repay a debt with.Not much to watch and not much to write of, surely."
1,A movie for stupid people,"This is an idiotic, stupid movie. It isn't even cool enough to romanticize, it is so dumb. Wow, it's too bad we've come to this. I used to think Justin Timberlake had a brain. Yikes, I'm sorry I spent the dollar on it at the Red Box at Giant. Wow, I thought we had really cheapened murder in Hollywood, but I had no idea until I saw this."
1,A waste of time,Absolutely horrible. What a waste. Justin Timberlake needs acting lesssons big time! The only scene worth any salt was at the end. Bad acting and poor direction blew it to hell.
3,Just okay,"I guess this film was okay. I'm glad I didn't see this in theater. This movie was pointless. Just a bunch of kids that had nothing to do except party. Well, Alpha Dog is about a guy named Johnny, who is a drug dealer,his friend Jake owes him money. Since Jake doesn't pay. Johnny and his friends kidnap his younger brother brother. **spoiler begginning**They kill him but in the end, they all get caught, no big deal, it is a true story.**Spoiler End** This movie is not worth $20.00 bucks. Take it or leave it."
5,great movie,"Great movie with great actors, I like how they put the real witnesses at the bottom of each screen when they are introduced into the plot. Based on real events"
2,Comedy Review of a serious movie,"Length:: 3:20 MinsWhile this is a serious film about what was truly a terrible tragedy (look it up online...), this is a SKETCH COMEDY MOVIE REVIEW. I improv comedy while giving an honest review of the film. Also, this is a review of the film NOT the DVD (so I don't cover the extras and so forth). Please enjoy!Other films released in theaters at the same time are also covered in this video review."
4,A STORY OF OUR TIME,"2006. Written and directed by Nick Cassavetes. Los Angeles, a generation of irresponsible children and parents, drugs and death. A frightening movie worth your attention."
1,Alpha Dog Unwatchable,"If you are an adult with brain cells Alpha Dog will be unwatchable. I had to turn it off after torturing through 45 minutes of watching adolescent males posturing with grotesque levels of ignorance. If there was action, suspense, plot, any shred of meaningful dialogue, I may have been able to watch the entire film. But who wants to pay money, and waste two hours, watching a room full of partying teens act stupidly? The characters are so painfully dumb it is torture to watch. The world of the uneducated and brash American teen age boy is not one I want to go to. Maybe there is a social message or commentary by the end of the film, but if you value your time and intelligence pass on this worthless peek into the world of drugged out teens"
4,You MUST give this movie a shot!,"I really loved this movie! It is refreshingly different from most other American films. Alpha dog has a great story, mostly very good acting and some really memorable moments.Justin Timberlake was very good here - to my great surprise - but the show belongs to Ben Foster. His ""Jake Mazursky"" is one of the most charismatic villains ever seen on film. Classic.The only thing that truly sucked was seeing Sharon Stone in that fat suit at the end. Man, what a joke! That scene was so bad it really hurt the movie. I am a real nice guy though, so I only deduct one star for it.Give it a shot!"
5,Wow,"I loved this movie! I thought it was awesome. Justin Timberlake was actually a good actor, and I wanted to just make fun of the movie! I thought the acting was spectacular, even though (and I know this is a true story) I think Zach should have used some of his black belt skills on Elvis when he had the chance!"
5,great movie,This Movie has to be one of my favorites and to know that its a true story makes it that much better
4,great movie,It was very interesting watching the true story of the fate of a young man. Jenkins Music company recomended it to me.
4,An Excellent Mysterious Twist,"Dorothy Phaire has done a remarkable job with this novel. The way she intertwined romance and mystery really grabs the reader and keep them hanging on until the very end. You will find yourself caught up and not wanting let go of the book, until you get to the very end. I can't wait for the sequel to Almost Out of Love."
4,Rollercoaster Ride with a Shocking Ending!,"Wowww. What a great ride/read. This book was like the Medusa at our local Six Flags theme park. It gripped me with it's compelling characters. Jetted me along with its fast paced plot, then took meu for a loop with it's surprise ending. It was really fun to read. I hope there's a sequel!"
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"I purchased this because I am interested in King, the Civil Rights Movement and because I grew up during this timeframe and wanted to know more. I was a bit apprehensive when I saw the size of the book and worried it would be a drudge, but nothing could have been further from the truth. I find I look forward to reading it each night and can't put it down, but at the same time I don't want it to end. I am almost finished with it and have purchased the second book so I can continue (and I was really glad to hear this is a trilogy). I can't recommend this book enough. And I talk to everyone about it. It is an important work and a pure joy to read. Thank you Mr. Branch!"
3,Parting the waters,"This book was so hard to get through. If you are looking for history about King and 1954-1963, this is the book for you. It does open your eyes to the awful truths about race and how white society handled losing control. A lot of people today would like to forget that period in time. While this book was chock full of history it does not pace the events slow enough for the reader to absorb what they are reading. It seems like Mr. Branch was so occupied with getting the facts out that he leaves the reader overwhelmed. Still in all, I think its a book that everyone should read because learning history is not always pretty but it is necessary."
2,Where's the book?,"Everything is good! I am pleased with the book. There was confusion as to where it was originally shipped; as mail to my home is being forwarded somewhere else. So, it was cool. My bad for the original poor review."
2,Outdated and flawed,"The book starts off by ridiculing the reading habits of Japanese workers. While it improves from that point, some of the methodologies are deeply (and deliberately) flawed. For instance, the author concludes that Lexus vehicles are not actually of high quality because they did not appear at the top of the JD Power five year durability reports. Of course, in the year the author chose as his baseline, Lexus had only been sold in the US for four years; the author deliberately ignored subsequent reports which put Lexus at or near the top. And of course in the decade since the book was written, Lexus has continued to rank at or near the top.The book is full of such errors, and while it's possible that some of them are honest mistakes, my conclusion was that the author decided to write a Japan-bashing book, then looked for ways to create ""evidence."" Eberts is a fraud."
1,Looking for an insightful book about Japan? Look elsewhere,"The Eberts spent a total of, maybe four months living in Japan, and somehow they get a contract to publish this book. The book abounds with inaccuracies, stereotypes and self-preening. The tone of the book is, ""These Japanese need some Americans to show them what to do...""Noone can get a good handle on a culture in only four months. Especially if you don't speak the language, which neither of the Eberts do. There's a lot to drive you nuts in Japan, but for a reflective analysis of the culture, don't buy this book."
5,Pretty much essential.,"Yup. This book really made using iMovie for the first time a walk in the park.Wiht absolutely no prior experience in this sort of stuff (the closest I've come is Photoshop Elements), I was able to, on the first try, make a music video of my son's first christmas.I was then able to convert an old videotape from the late 70's into a gleaming, groovy DVD.The book is well laid out, easy to navigate and above all, usable.It's a five-star manual, no doubt about it."
5,Created a 30+ minute slideshow using this book,This book served as a guide to go from not knowing anything about iMovie to being able to create a large slideshow project. I ordered another guide first and couldn't get off square one. This guide allowed me from starting at no knowledge to understanding well enough to get my job done. The iMovie icon sat on my desktop for years before this book opened it's utility. A small and worthwhile investment to get the most out of this software. It has even given me the bug to get a camcorder and move from photography to videography.
2,History includes misinformation and bias,"Thanksgiving is a harvest festival; a time to show appreciation for all we have. Teaching our children a biased viewpoint of the First Thanksgiving empowers racism to continue in this country. Popular renditions of the First Thanksgiving (such as this book) give children the mistaken impression that the relationship between American Indians and English colonists was one of mutual help, respect and friendship. This popular belief does not take into account the way in which the colonists persecuted the American Indians, sold them into slavery and drove them from their homes. Not to mention the epidemic diseases colonists brought to America, genocide and erosion of tribal soverreignty. Get to know American Indian history through their stories, captured by Gerald McDermott or other authors at another time of year rather than celebrating the dreadful."
2,Typical Western Style Entertainment,"This is the first time for me to watch ""Hot body"" DVD show series. I'm a little bit disappointed of the ladies in the DVD show. Some are pretty, but most of them looks not that well. If you want to watch girls of traditional western style dancing or doing nothing but smiling as well as different style from the Playboy or Penthouse, Maybe Hot body DVD will serve your appetite."
3,Not recommended for independent travelers,"We took this book with us on our 3-week vacation to Italy last month. While it does contain thorough information about many cities and towns in Italy (including many of those not covered in other guidebooks), I didn't enjoy the format of the book.The book describes many cities through walking tours, as well as driving tours of various areas. There is a map showing the route and the text goes along with the route of the tour, but lacks a lot of the historical and artistic background that another guide might provide.If you're the kind of vacationer who wants to explore a new city and see what it has to offer, plus get a few suggestions for hotels and restaurants, this book is for you. If you already know where you're going, what sites to see, and want more historical information, I'd suggest the Rough Guide to Italy instead."
3,Godd MP3 Player but slow as molasses,"This MP3 player is feature packed, but getting music on and off this thing is a nightmare (really). I have since learned that my money would have been better spent on an Ipod."
1,Same problem as someone above - A piece of junk,"At first the thing worked fine. I liked the way it looked, the color are very nice and vivid, everything was good. Occasionally it would freeze up and then I would get it reset and everything was ok. Then the other day when I turned it on I heard a clicking sound and then received an error message that said ""plug the player into the computer"". It was the first time I received that message so I got a little suspicious. I plugged it in and nothing happened. I went on the website and uninstalled and re-installed a ton of stuff. I downloaded stuff from the site and NOTHING worked. Days of this and now I'm about to throw this piece of junk away. I'm on amazon right now looking for another mp3 player"
2,Machine Doesn't Work,"I researched so many different Mp3 players before purchasing the Go Gear. I had owned an iPod mini before but it broke and so I was faced with getting a new one. When I recieved my Go Gear I was blown away with the style and finishing touches on it. It is really attractive. If only the hardware was as wonderful. It requires using Windows Media Player which is a CRAPPY program to begin with and the Go Gear doesn't like using it. After working with it for 3 whole days, 18 hours a day, I finally decided to return it, giving up hope that it would be useful to me. I was severely disappointed with it and do not reccomend it to ANYONE. I do however reccomend the refurbished products at apple.com. If you can swallow bowing to apple (which just makes it easier to get accessories and useful tools) you can get ALOT for your money and it has a year warranty. Just a thought. I ended up buying a 20GB iPod (not the color one) for less than what I paid for the Go Gear."
3,"Great poduct!, just not good software","I recently purchased a philips 6gb hdd based mp3 player. The product itself is very sturdy and has about 14hrs of playback at full volume continuous play. Unfortunately its software on the device is laggy (2-3 seconds sometimes for a response. Also windows media player sync is SLOOOW! It takes probably an hour and a half to sync up 2gb of files. The features are great for the price: 6gb small compact design, fm receiver with record capabilities, and voice record. As well as jpg file viewer. Over all it is a good product, but definitely falls short of an ipod."
