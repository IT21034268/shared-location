1,This is a poor drill press,"I ordered this as a drill press to use with my dremel for making PC boards.It is inadequate for that purpose. There is at least 3 mm of play in the press. What's worse, when you operate the press it swings the bit side to side one MM, which makes it extremely difficult to locate holes in the center of a solder pad. This also causes bits to break and wear prematurely.Additionally, the hardware that came with the stand did not fit. For instance, the bolt and nut arrangement used to secure the base to the stand would have been great if the bolt actually fit in the hole. I had to drill out the hole to fit the bolt, or drill and tap it (I had a tap the correct size, so I did away with the nut).If you're looking for a reasonably precise drill press, stay away from this piece of junk."
3,Good price for a drill press,"Works fine, but wish they didn't switch to a plastic pinon. My old drill press had a metal pinon that is still going strong. I'm concerned the plastic part won't last. Perhaps I am worrying over nothing - time will tell. Otherwise, it's a great price for a drill press. Arrived super fast."
5,too good !,this is just what i wanted !went together perfect !what a great product at a great price !
2,Ordered New!,"I ordered this item, I thought was new.But when I recieved it, it was obvious it is not new and also not complete. The plate that that is supposed to cover the coil that returns the press to it's original postion, is not there and without it It is not safe and is an eyesore.Also it was packed losely, with no ""popcron"" or paper to hold the pieces in place. Just thrown in a box, so everything is dinged and scratched???I am seriously thinking about not ever ordering from Amazon again. This is the 2nd. Item that I recieved from them, that is not what they presented it as... and I am not a hard person to please, but if something is used and incomplete I want the option to decide rather I want it in that condition!"
4,Sturdy and useful,"This stand is much sturdier than I expected, as many of the other dremel attachments out there are plastic and flimsy feeling. In addition to being able to use this as a mini drill press, this is excellent as flexible shaft stand."
4,PCB Drilling,After tightening up the screws and adjusting everything the press works perfectly for drilling PCBs. The key was making sure everything was tight. I would award 5 stars but the handle initially would not stay attached. After a bit of pressing the handle stayed in well and things worked well.I have drilled about 100 holes in PCBs with little or no variation or unexpected movement.
2,Tightening screw,The tightening screw on the press I ordered has no threads to thread into the carrier rendering the press completely and utterly useless. The carrier just rests at the base and has no support. Be wary and buy at the store so you can check it out first.
2,Rotary Tool Stand,This Rotary Tool Stand works fine with one of my three Dremel Tools. My oldest one. The new Xrp wont fit and do not see an easy way to make it work. Also my Battery Dremel also wont fit. I think the company needs to make adapters so that all Dremel tools fit. So the bottom line is make very sure you check and see if the tool fir a very limited dremels.
1,"Don't buy!!! It might be cheaper than the Dremel, but...","Poorly designed and constructed. The body is made of plastic, the stand and holder for the Dremel are made of pot metal. The components don't fit together very well and as a result it is virtually impossible to get a straight up and down hole with any precision. Don't buy!!! You'll regret it!! Spend the extra money for the Dremel drill press"
3,"An ok gadget for the techphile, definitely needs zoom","I bought this gadget for it's many functions although I mostly used it to take video and pictures, sometimes record audio. I really did like it, but after a while I couldn't justify the cost versus the quality... The video quality was ok, about what you get with a medium resolution avi file, but nowhere close to divx quality. Picture resolution at 640x480 was decent, but you'd definitely want better if you want quality pictures. Sound recording was good, but I could only playback on the unit. With SD cards you don't have to worry about memory. My main gripe about this gadget though is the absence of a zoom. I was using it one time when a friend asked me if it had a zoom feature. I told him ""this is the zoom"" and ran up closer to the subject. If Panasonic added a zoom feature I would definitely recommend it, but overall it doesn't excel in any area. You're probably better off picking up a megapixel digital camera that also takes video."
1,A big let down !,"I bought this camcorder/camera/mp3player/voice recorder with high expectations for it,but when I received it and tried itout,I was very disappointed with the quality of the video and pictures. ... I thought this item would have more to it than just record and playback.It doesn't even have a zoom,so you can't get a wide or close-up angle.Again,with the price being as it is,I was hoping to get alot more from this item."
4,"VERY GOOD, BUT LIMITED","This is a great camera for fun. It starts up slow, but you can get used to that. It takes good pictures, that I can set as a background on my computer. The video-making is ok, but it is limited. It has a very slow frame rate, making the video move strange, but for its size, it's not so bad. The recorder is good, but I am still trying to figure out how to transfer it on to my computer. I am not sure what program can read .vm1 (the file type for recording on this camera), but I know that I do not have it, this is very frustrating. It works as an mp3 player very well. It never skips, so it functions very well at that. The best part about it is it's size. It is so small that it can fit behind a business card! It can fit in my pocket, so I can bring it wherever I want to."
4,Useful to share stuff over the web,"It is a bundle of many at/above average gadgets into one.1. MP3 player needs Real Jukebox (which doesn't allow copying MP3 files 128 kbps or above)2. MPEG4 recorder has a low frame-rate (although the voice is fine)3. Need Real Jukebox to transfer what was recorded by Voice recorder4. Resolution of digital photos are 840x680 (not even 1 Mpixel)All in all, useful to share stuff over the web.. esp. to people with low-bandwidth access."
1,Good enough for 1 star I suppose,"I bought this CD because many say the lead singer sounds a lot like a young Bruce Dickinson -- which would be great if true. Having been an Iron Maiden fan since 1986 I personally don't hear it. I don't think anybody could mistake this guy for Dickinson.And, obviously, they are huge Dickinson fans naming their band after a song on his ""Chemical Wedding"" album, that he did just before returning to Maiden.It doesn't sound like the work of Dickinson nor the work of Maiden.Even standing alone, it's just not very good."
5,A Divine Book!,"And I mean that in every sense of the word: sacred, lovely, excellent, perceptive and intuitive. Peter Levitt's vivid writing and obvious love of storytelling makes each page shine. As I read the book, I felt lost in the wilderness of my imagination and my heart, with a wise and friendly guide hovering near. The exercises at the end of each chapter are not merely ""one time wonders"" but techniques I know I'll return to again and again. In his chapter on permission, Levitt writes, ""Everything is permitted in the imagination."" And so it is with the exercises. Our only limitation being how far we are willing to go. Fingerpainting on the Moon is a great adventure."
4,Note: It's a radio edit,"Great CD, but beware that the ""Things Have Changed"" cut is the radio edit. To get the full version of the song, you have to get the Japanese import or the ""Wonder Boys"" soundtrack."
3,This is NOT Quiet,"This has very strong vibrations, but it most definitely is NOT as quiet as it claims. There are others on the market (albeit, not as cute) that are a great deal quieter. It has good vibration quality, though. I'd recommend it if you don't mind the noise."
3,Doesn't fit older Monticello screw mounts,"Will need to redrill and patch screw holes in tile for at least one screw for older Monticello models. Moen needs to make a lasting shower mount for these expensive model fixtures, not a tarnishable/peeling plastic mount."
3,Dated and riddled,"The book has fallen out of date since it was written, and MySQL is now on a later revision than is addressed by this book.The book is also flawed by numerous typographical errors as well as sloppy editing.That being said, the many mistakes actually helped me understand the coding better, being forced to play ""Where's Waldo"" looking for the inevitable error on what seemed to be every example.The overall format was really not bad, and the book was pretty comprehensible despite the mistakes, so I gave it a couple stars back.An updated edition paired with an editor who actually looks at the book would be in order. As it is, it is really only useful as a primer before engaging in deeper study with a more professionally produced book."
4,"Not the best thing they've done, but some darn fine moments","This album is pretty hit and miss, but it's nice to see them getting back to their roots. ""Don't Hold Back Your Love"" is the finest moment on this album by far, and in my opinion is one of their best songs of all time. I absolutely love that song! There are some other songs on this album that I hit repeat on the CD player for, mainly ""Change of Seasons"" and ""So Close"", their last big hit. Still hoping they can make the big comeback, because there is so much talent and quality there."
3,good album,"I just read the reviews by my fellow amazon reviewers and i was sad to see 4 and half stars and 5 star ratings for hall and oates ""change of season"" album! I love hall and oates, but come on guys/gals lets be realistic here, ok? ""Don't hold back your love"" is the best song here ( written by richard page ( ex-mr.mister ), + pat mestelotto plays drums on this song ( also ex- mr.mister ). ""so close"" sounds best on the unplugged version, ( try to find ""looking Back"", japan only greatest hits cd, has ""so close"" played at There best! ), starting all over again"" ( now there ""antheme"" song for concerts).most of the album is unfocused, daryl halls voice...at times, sounds angry and tired.Its no wonder why hall and oates took a 6 year break from Each other."
5,A pretty sweet album,"I was a big fan of Hall & Oates since the early 80s, and as I get older they only seem to get better! This 1990 album contains their last major hit (So Close), but all of the tracks are great. I really liked So Close (OK, who didn't?), Everywhere I Look, Give It Up, and Heavy Rain.I don't think you necessarily have to be a fan of 80s music, or even of Hall & Oates to think that this is a pretty sweet album. I really like it and don't hesitate to recommend it to everyone!"
5,These songs HIT home for me.,"Loved this entire CD, The first time I heard it.It hit a time in my life when things were really changing. From bad to good to great, I didn't even know it at the time....but these songs sure did."
5,passed,"years ago i had originally bought this book as a present for my much younger sister. Reading it before i gave it to her to make sure it was age appropriate. Even as an older teenager and an experianced reader i found this book very delightful, upon handing it to my sister she too enjoyed reading it, and passed it to all of her friends. years later i asked her if she still possesed it as i wanted to read it again. i was in my mid-twentys still enjoying the book as much as i had the first time, i also passed it to all of my friends, who enjoyed it just as much as my sister and i did. Now the copy is very much worn and still read over ten years later."
5,Great Book!,"This book is fantastic. I felt like it changed me, and I can read it over and over. The message is so deep, and I totally recommend it!"
3,Beware of Subject Matter,"Winter of Fire is a captivating book with an excellent overarching theme - equality for all people. However, some subject matter seems a bit ""R-Rated!"" Almost every time the heroine meets a young man, the young man wants to have sex with her. At one point the couple, that barely know eachother, are half naked before she stops. She does stop the young man every time, but only because of her dream that she must make come true. Her dream stops her, neither respect for her own worth or furture nor moral convictions. These scenes were unnecessary and could have easily been editted out. Two unresolved inconsistencies remain in the book: 1. The lesser position of women in society and 2. The worship of God and the abuse of His Name."
5,Amazing,"I first read this book in 7th grade because I had to to earn points for a reading class. I was so angry at having to read things against my will, and put off reading this book for as long as possible. however, after a few minutes of reading... I was engrossed in this book. It was so amazing... with so many levels of meaning. I encourage all to read this book and experience it for yourself."
5,A young woman leads her people to freedom.,"The ""chosen"" rule over the world of ice, including the ""quelled"", a group of slaves. Elsha finds a deep power within herself that can lead the quelled to go beyond the curtain. With all of the troubles and hard times, will Elsha succeed in her life long goal?"
4,thoughts,"I bought this because I read it in high school and I remember loving it even though I couldn't remember much about it. I read it again and thought it was pretty good I'm glad there was some romance in it but I did have mix emotions about the whole story by the time I was done. But loved the ending and wanted it to continue, but every story must come to an end eventually."
5,Wow! This is so Good,"Winter of Fire is so cool! (no pun inteneded)It is about a furtue world where there is no sun, and everything is cold. The Quelled, a race that mines firestones to keep the ruling race, the Chosen, warm, is close to rebellion. Elsha, A Quelled, sets out to the mines one day and is chosen to be the Firelord's handmaid (the king). Even though this new job is full of honor, it comes with a price. The Chosen will not except who she is. To them, she is Quelled, and therefore has no mind. You have to read this!"
5,Going Back With the Best,"I was resting in my room when this movie came on cable. The soundtrack roused me and the narrative style of Sean Penn pulled me in. So, I got up, and went out to watch this documentary. I came of age - on the East Coast - during the 70's. I have to admit, I was a party girl, running with the boys - and knew nothing of stakeboarding. Yet, the ZBoys soundtrack was the background to my life in the early 70's. I was fascinated by their absolute lack of fear. Watching Jay Adams take that road with no helmet at 70 mph took my breath away. This movie celebrates that very special time in life, and the Zboys,and the soundtrack did it proud. Loved this flick and am really looking forward to the Lords of Dogtown. Good Luck, Tracy."
4,Terrific for the Unfamiliar,"Just saw on ESPN classic. Very interesting interviews,music,and footage. Besides being entertaining it bridges the gap between Endless Summer and X-treme Games [snowboarding in particular]. Only disappointment was not crediting the owner or property of the ""Dogbowl"". Maybe they don't want any crashers 30 years later."
5,Awesome!,"So great to see the actual footage of the Z boys, and cool to see how they turned out. I'm glad someone took some film footage to record this incredible time in skateboarding. I was a little kid with my first skateboard just a few years after the poly wheels came out, and during the seventies droughts in Cali. I tried skating in emptied pools and these guys make it look so easy - it's not! This is a really good documentary."
3,Case Was Broken,The case for his CD was badly crushed and broken when it arrived. Fortuneately the DVD was not damaged.
2,Interesting subject - bad documentary,"I agree with others that the subject matter was interesting, but the total substance of this documentary could have been presented nicely in 20 minutes.Each new bit of information was given in a small spurt and then repeated and emoted upon while being loosely illustrated with redundant video footage.I found it boring."
5,dogtown take me home,"I was soo glad I saw this movie...I'm from SoCal and I live in FL. It made me want to hop a plane and go home! Whether you have an apriciation for skating or are a hardcore skater, this movie is a must see! The soundtrack kicks. I wanna go hoooome!! *sniffle*"
5,MANDATORY VIEWING FOR SKATER's!!!,"This is one of the best documenterey's I have ever seen , on any subject!!Take a look to the PAST of skateboarding and surfing with Stacey Parela, a former pro skater himself!!I am an OLD SCHOOLER so I appreciate this film much more than word's can express, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO SKATE!!!The music RULE's..how could it not..Sabbath,the stooge's, Cooper,Hendrix..etc!! GREAT SELECTION!!If you have any interest in skateboarding, then this will be helpful to tell you about how it is DONE!!LIFESTYLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Funny!,"You know the little skate rats in your town, the ones that interrupt sidewalk traffic and scar public property? Meet their heroes. This is a documentary about forty year old geezers who wax nostalgic about trespassing into peoples homes and ruining their pools by skateboarding in them. These pioneers of ""Xtreme"" sports speak with such seriousness about their ""accomplishment"" that you'd think they discovered penicillin.Bravo."
1,Boring,this movie was so boring that it made me cry. the only good thing i could say about this film is that i liked some of the stunts that the boys did other than that yuck. just not my type of film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't unless you are into skateboarding and surfing.
3,Lords of Dogtown,"lords of dogtown is a film based a montley crew of skateboarding junkies,the legendary Z boys,who revolutionised tthe sport of skateboarding in the mid1970s in the film ,TONY ALVA(victor rasuk),STACY PERALTA(JOHN ROBINSON)and JAY ADAMS(EMILE HIRSCH are the skateboarderseveryone can watch it ratings:three stars is enough.if you want to see boys play with their toys in this case skateboarding then you should watch this movie"
3,Dogtown <The Hood by the beach>,I liked the footage of POP and the music was excellent but I think it's wrong to praise a group of rowdy guys who took over Bay Street and POP Pier then wouldn't let anyone else surf there.It was also interesting to see that most of this bunch failed to capitalize on their brush with fame.
3,Should've been longer...,"I have to say this movie was quite enjoyable...and that's an understatement. I enjoyed the ""punk-aesthetic"" of the editing, the cool photos, and especially the soundtrack. I wished the documentary dug a little deeper into the crew's backgrounds though (i.e. family life, school [some dropped out of high school], drug use, aftermath of the '70's skateboard craze, etc.). It left me hangin' a bit; so many unanswered questions. Too many skeletons I guess... I wanted the ""low-down"". Overall it's still a good film (in a flashy ""video"" sorta way!)..."
5,An exquisitely produced slice of pre X-Games sporting angst,"I'm a big fan of documentaries. Especially documentaries about the cooler things in life. 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' is an excellent production, giving a fascinating insiders perspective on the evolution of modern Skateboarding. Produced by Stacey Peralta, with assistance from the expert photographic lens of Craig Steyck; 'Dogtown' ... you in with it's exquisite juxtaposition of still photos, old home movies, classic rock, and interviews. Even if you don't care about Skateboarding, this film definately merits your attention. Artfully constructed, visually rich, and full of great anecdotes, 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' is one of my three favorite documentaries released in 2002."
5,Fast shipping,"I recieved this right away and in new condition, just as promised. Thanks you very much!"
5,"This is a ""Must Have"" for any skateboarder","Seldom does history need a review, I started skating in the mid 70's and grew up looking at magazines with pictures of this guys getting ""radical"".I was lucky enough to become good friends with someone that came to live to Chile from Venice beach. His sister use to date Jay Adams, so I always had a very inside look at what was happening in Cal.This Film is excellent, it clearly shows how the Z-Boys took skateboarding into a new dimention."
3,Coulda been real good!!!,Too bad Peralta didn't tell the story of what was really happening at the beach. It could have been great...Parelta gave the yuppie kook memory of it...The best part of this movie is the P.O.P. parts . . . and the music...
2,Glory Daze,"I laughed out loud at the end of this documentary when I realized that ""Dogtown"" was made by the people it praises. What a silly movie. Full of phony bravado and chest beating, it plays out like the Bruce Springsteen song...... :""boring stories of Glory Days"".The only people that I respected were the machinist and Jay Adams, the guy in prison, who at least admitted what a burnout he was. The rest of the ""stars"" don't even realize how marginal they have become. Really quite sad.That said, I did enjoy the Del Mar Nationals and the footage of Jay blowing minds to Hendrix."
2,Not what it seems,"Skateboarding could really do without self conscious myth making like this. One part that really got me mad was the film maker saying ""These guys were making history every single day!"" or something to that effect. Who are the egotistical ones, the filmakers there to get rich and famous or the skaters who made their own decks and skated curbs in the rain for the enjoyment of it? I eventually flicked channels half way through the movie after a piece of dubious editing.Stuff like this gets in the way of skateboarding."
2,Dogtown?,"More like ""Skateboarder Town.""If you really like dogs, I'd recommend ""Best in Show."" If you're into Z-Boys, though, this movie might be for you."
2,...zzz,"...zzz, see I'm still asleep after watching the first 30 minutes of this movie. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! I was bored out of my mind. This wasn't even interesting. I was expecting alot more from this movie. Maybe I should be quiet because I'm not a skater. I do play the games and bought the soundtrack to THPS3. Unless you're a hardcore skater, I don't recommend this movie to anybody. Another negative is that the DVD doesn't even contain a widescreen presentation, its in full frame with 5.0 surround not 5.1 which would have made it better. I have to admit the 2 stars is for Sean Penn's narration, I tried so hard to stay up through it to see what he brought to this and it was quite a bit. The DVD case and disc artwork is cool. The case is a see through blue and the disc is a red wheel with the title and logos. Watch this movie ONLY if you're a skater or surfer (the first 15-20 minutes is about surfing)."
4,Good,"WAY too self-congratulatory a movie. I mean, these guys are SKATEBOARDERS. The narration and interviews give the impression they discovered the theory of relativity.Having said that, I did enjoy the movie a lot. For one thing I was a So. Cal. grom when urethane Cadillac wheels hit the scene and changed skate boarding, and all my friends and I raced down to the surf shops and bought them. How weird and wonderful to see Cadillac wheels on a movies screen all these years later.And Tony Alva used to scare me when I'd read interviews with him when he was the #1 skate star. Nice to see he's matured into a soft spoken, mature individual.This was a trip down nostalgia lane I never thought I'd experience. I thought those guys and that time were long forgotten. I felt like calling up all my friends from when I was 12 to reminisce...but I don't know where the hell they are now. I hope they see this movie, too, and remember those times. We had some fun."
5,GREAT FILM,great film simple as that well edited great story great music and great skating watch it rent it buy it I saw it in theaters three times and have seen it dozens of times on video
3,Coulda been longer though...,"I have to say this movie was quite enjoyable...and that's an understatement. I enjoyed the ""punk"" editing, the cool photos, and especially the soundtrack (soundtrack shoulda had all the songs!). I wished the documentary dug a little deeper into the crew's backgrounds though (i.e. family life, school [some dropped out of high school], drug use, aftermath of the '70's skateboard craze, etc.). It left me hangin' a bit; so many unanswered questions. I wanted the ""low-down""! Too many skeletons I guess...all style, less substance.Overall it's still a good film (in a flashy ""video"" sorta way!)..."
2,"An outline, not a book","This book weighs in at 217 pages (including index). Unfortunately, what you really get is about 50 pages worth of material, and much of that is repetitive and/or obvious.Particularly galling are the many pages (over 25) devoted to quotes, one quote per page. We're talking 15-20 words per page for such pages. OK, nice quotes, but they should take a line or two each, not a page.Probably the most useful thing is that it includes a sample business plan.In sum, this book is an outline of the book it should be, and an outline that has been stretched to cover 200 pages.Until the authors write the book that goes with this outline, save your money."
2,Jeff Healey Hell to Pay,"There were a couple of good songs, but would not recommend. Disappointed. Trusted other reviews.Would not recommend buying this."
5,Rockin' Blues,The best CD that the Jeff Healy Band has ever made! A must for those that like Rock with a strong blues influence. Seven or eight very strong cuts on this album. imdocrock@prodigy.net
5,Everything You Need In a Hebrew Bible,"The font is a readable size, the binding and covers are solid, and there's no...dust jacket to quibble over. Just wish it was a smooth cover rather than cloth, but oh well... (and I wish it came in black). But other than this minutia, get this if you're looking to invest in a Hebrew Bible."
2,Large Font?,"This book claims to be written in a large font, however the font is barely larger than the paperback edition. The large print edition is at most 2 points larger than the paperback, maybe a 12 or 13 point font. What makes this book bigger is the extra space at the bottom of the page which is not all that usefull for making notes. This edition is poorly laid out for enjoyable reading and useful notation. Don't waste you money to get this so called ""large print"" edition, you should probably just buy the regular sized one."
3,Not a bad book,"This was basically a paragraph or two of each of the actresses/comediennes the author considers to have been ""funny ladies"" since the beginning of film. Some of the choices are interesting (Barbara Stanwyck, for example) and there are also the more typical picks - Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, etc.It's a rather heavy book as well and oversized."
1,Don't Buy Spy Gear,"My 6-year old grandson loves to play spy so I thought this would be a neat toy for him. However it is definitely not worth the $11.00 I spent for it. The only way you really get any effects from the Micro Agent Listener is to speak right into the phone part, then it sounds louder. It's advertised that you can hold the phone around a corner and hear what others are saying. It just doesn't work that way. I would not advise anyone to buy this."
5,"Awesome, timeless music","This music sounds as fresh and rich as when it first came out. People who hear it while visiting always ask where to buy a copy!!! (Amazon, of course)."
2,ITEM MISLABELED - confusing!,It is unclear what is being sold here. The picture is of Cherished Teddies 107084 Circus Action Musical Figure. The title and number under the picture are for an entirely different item - Flo #107063. Someone needs to doublecheck to see which item this actually is!
1,Quantity 2 or 1 per card?,"When I ordered these, the Amazon.com website indicated that with each order you received TWO holders. At $7.75 that seemed reasonable for two of them. I just received them and there is only ONE. I checked with the Amazon website and the product information now says ""1 per card"", the price has also dropped to $4.99. No way are these things worth $5 each but absolutely not $7.75 each. And how improper to change the product description."
4,Broom holder,"These holders are awesome and very handy to keep an extra in a drawer for when you need to add additional holders. Easy to put up and they hold anything with a handle - brooms, Swifters, etc. The purchase was uneventful. That is - no problems. I ordered it and received it - just like it's supposed to happen."
5,"Very Simple, Clever Device",Seems like every time I opened the pantry the broom would fall over and try to attack me. This is a very cheap and good solution to that problem.It installed in about five seconds and now the broom handle has a permanent home and hasn't escaped once yet.Very happy with this. Recommended.
5,Nifty broom holder!,"I have a very tiny broom closet and didn't want one of those large rack kinds of broom holders. This one doesn't require a large space and I can be flexible about exactly where to place it. The opening was a bit too small to fit the mop I was hoping to use it for. Bummer. However, it works great for my wood handled broom and I'm going to order another one for my Swiffer. I liked how easy it was to mount and that it didn't require tools. Great idea!"
4,"If your broom fits, it's a great product.","I bought this to store a broom behind a door. It's inexpensive and works very well, and was easy to put up. It's built strongly enough where it should last a good long time. The only issue I had was the hole the broom needs to fit through is a little small, and I needed to remove a hook at the end of my broom's handle to make it fit. However, once it fit, it was absolutely great."
4,First and Best,"Not counting the Greatest Hits, this is Alan Jackson's best album. I didn't jump on the ""Chattahoochee"" bandwagon like everyone else did. I already liked Alan Jackson when that song came out and it almost made me a non-fan because country radio ran it right straight into the ground like they do Garth, Shania, Tim, and Faith these days. Here in the Real World offers several fantastic cuts that he has matched only a couple of times since. The title hit, Chasin' That Neon Rainbow, Home, and I'd Love You All Over Again are all good songs, but it's the second single that nails it for me---""Wanted"". It's the best song in Mr. Jackson's entire career and it alone would make this album worth buying. All those others I mentioned are just icing on the cake."
4,Very nice book!,Awesome pictures taken form high up in the sky. One can find unique views that are beyond imagination. Also included necessary information regarding NASA expeditions.
1,"The Darksend, not Darkseed","Do not buy this album thinking it is Darkseed, It is actually THE DARKSEND. I have no idea why amazon has it listed under Darkseed, but I pretty much wasted $18 for a band with constantly repetitive riffs and a horrible singer, that sounds almost like early cradle, but very much worse. If you like weird black metal, buy this, otherwise, its a waste of money. Maybe amazon.com will actually fix their name."
4,Texas Injustice,"This is the most compelling piece of literature that I have read in many years. Nanon Williams gives us a first hand account of the abuses he has suffered on death row while incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. This book is proof of Williams' great gifts, and the State of Texas should be ashamed for denying life to one so obviously productive and gifted. Until this book, we on the outside would have never guessed that the Texas justice system could be so negligent and barbaric. As American citizens we owe Nanon Williams gratitude for opening our eyes to the horrors that our tax dollars have been supporting. If this man dies, we should all feel accountable for standing by and helping fund the execution of an innocent man."
1,Very disappointing,"My daughter and I have read ""Nancy Keeps House"" and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, this book reflects not only a jump of 10 years for Nancy, but a jump from the culture of the 1950's to the culture of the 1960's. This book has a definite feminist theme throughout and is not the gentle, motherly wisdom that we had come to expect from this author."
4,Good boxes...,good boxes but not as strong as other brands. The first box i assembled was difficult for me and took me about 15 minutes because of the instructions how to assemble. But after the first one i was able to assemble quickly. I won't put to much stuff in the one box because it doesn't seem strong enough. The one thing i really like about bankers boxes is the easy to lift handles. these boxes were a little bit pricey but they serve the purpose.
1,Horrible customer service,"It wasn't clear when the boxes would ship, and the company didn't respond quickly to my email. When I cancelled as I needed to know immediately about shipment, the company responded in a very rude manner. And was rude several times in email - and I mean rude! I would never treat a customer in this manner. This is written by Deb."
5,Pretty good box,It a good file box. Note that the card board is not heavy duty so they probably won't withstand too much rough treatment. A bit of extra tape helps to reinforce them. Amazon shipping boxes for example seem to be slightly heavier and thicker. But they are good for everyday use or filing.
3,learn to count,"The product was as advertised and exactly was i was looking for. The ad,however; claims thee are 12 boxes and there were only 11. In fact, only11 boxes fit in the crate. Bad business practice!"
3,Got 2 out of 3 Correct,"The box themselves are awesome. I use them for everything from storage, toys, books, crafts, etc. However, it is a shot in the dark on how you receive them. Twice they came in a nice package with all 12 boxes. The third order came in an obscenely over size box, 4 boxes were missing, and there was sticky tape all over them which caused tears. I would still order them again because I do like them and they are inexpensive."
4,Good buy!,"Trying a new solution to store office files and receipts 7 years back. Easy to assemble, hopefully will stack well."
5,Bankers Box,"all Bankers Boxes are great. I am using these to store files like old taxes, etc. They fit many shelving units and are very useful."
3,bemused,"I read and loved Guest of a Sinner and was excited to read more books by Wilcox. I checked out the reviews carefully before choosing Modern Baptists to read next. I found the book to be very dated. The characters were stereotypical, the situations weren't interesting, the pace crawled along. Unlike apparently everyone else who reviewed this, I didn't laugh out loud, not once. If I hadn't bought it new, I'm not sure I would have even finished it. I'm giving this three stars because I feel as if I must have missed something. . . but I'm not sure what it could have been. I certainly won't be reading it again to find out."
2,"sometimes, I want to shoot Flannery O'Connor","Only sometimes. But to her credit, she had a point, a purpose. Her characters were driven forward by the theme, the core of the story. Yes, they were quirky and irritating. Yes, they were funny. But they served a larger purpose. Unlike Mr. Wilcox's. I kept waiting for a point. I thought perhaps I caught the whiff of it for a while: submerged gay life in a Southern town. But no, that was just another false lead, in a book full of them. So many quirky little details, doing nothing, going nowhere. For example, at one point, the characters are talking and a dog walks up on the porch to sniff around, as it does every night. And that's it. Period. There's no point to the dog, no reason for it to be in the story. It's just another quirky, funny, little, meaningless detail. One of billions. Enough to drag any plot to a dead halt."
2,No longer a good buy.,"I am a mom and a pediatrician and have been buying this and other Mustela products since my 7 year old was a newborn. I just bought two packs for my little one and to my surprise, the sheets were smaller, thinner and less moist than before. For the money, in this day and age I think this is the last pack I'll buy. I used to be able to swab almost a whole toddler bottom, poopy or not, with one sheet. No longer. The two stars are for the fragrance which is heavenly. You'll do better to mist your child's clothes with the Mustela fragrance spray and buy Huggies wipes instead. Much larger, and gentle on the skin and a much better buy for the money. I guess Mustela didn't think we'd notice the change, but this mom did!"
2,Gave my baby a rash,"I would love to like these but each time I use them, they cause hundreds of bumps on my baby's skin. Even though I love the scent, I imagine it is not good for a baby's new skin. I have great success with Seventh Generation wipes."
5,"They cost more, but they're worth it...","I've used these wipes for 6 months now, and think they're worth the extra money. On the rare occassion when I've run out before I was organized enough to order my next shipment, I've had to make do with some Huggies or Pampers wipes, and even the sensitive ones leave a tackiness that you never have with Mustela. It has a gentle scent, and leaves my baby's skin soft but clean. I highly recommend."
2,I concur about the smell - way too strong to feel comfortable using on baby!,"I originally bought these wipes from Nordstroms (figured if they are sold there they must be good) but have hardly used them because of the incredibly strong odor of the perfume the wipes are bathed in. Personally, I just don't feel comfortable rubbing that much fragrance oil on my baby's skin."
4,Aubrey tells it like it is,"Granted, Aubrey doesn't back his claims fastidiously by science. However, anyone who's ever compared aloe vera straight from the plant to that sticky-dry film that forms on your skin when you get synthetically-laced aloe vera can attest to the validity of his claims. Plus, it's good to read someone who's not exactly logical or concerned with being PC. Plenty of info for vegetarians, and my only complaint is since there's several different charts and dictionaries, it could be better organized. However, Aubrey knows his stuff. I used avocado oil at his recommendation for some eczema I had, and it cleared up within a week."
5,everything you need to know,This book has it all. Aubrey Hampton tells you all you ever need to know. I really recommend it. I have read a lot of books of this kind and I belive this one is the best!
5,Let's Get Loud Import = Awsome remixes!,"This is the Maxi- Single CD and it has 3 remixes First it has the regular version of Lets Get Loud and the 3 remixes include The Kung Pow remix, Castle hill club mix and Matt and Vittos live your life remix. These remixes are all awsome i give the remixes 5 stars and as for Jennifer Lopez she gets infinate stars!"
3,Didn't meet expectation,"The series is good, but I already had it all on DVD, I got this to get the two new OVA's, that I was hoping would be possibly a continuation of the series. It wasn't. It was a condenced version of the series (each ova is each season), with some added stuff."
4,Worth The Buy,"Would Be 5 Stars If the ova's where in english. Great Series. I felt the common ""Sad"" of when you finish a good anime because you don't want it to end."
4,Vandread,This anime is not to bad. It has fairly good story to it. You may want to watch it on Youtube. Then you may want to buy it/
2,Really Disappointing,"As a fan of voodoo and occult stories I really looked forward to Voodoo Child. I was very disappointed. I also found the dialog annoying and the plot was so immature. As far as being frightening goes, this book fell short of the mark."
2,Shallow characters see campy Voodoo forces at work.,"As a frequent visitor to the Crescent City, Graves did an adequate job describing contemporary New Orleans. The figures he places in that landscape, however, seem to more like first generation Califorians than the 4th generation persons d'heritage I've encountered in the Big Easy. His written dialog is often annoying--broken up by simplistic reflections. His characters also seem to dwell in morally black and white worlds. While not my favorite novel, Graves could learn a lot from ""Midnight in the garden of good and evil"" when attacking this type of subject matter."
1,Ugh,"This has to be one of the worst horror stories I've read. No plot, dumb characters, stupid ending."
3,Ordinary. It could be better.,"Actually, I thought it would entertain me but it didn't. It is not boring, but the plot is standard, it means it is predictable. It is one of the million of other horror books published all around the world. Nevertheless, I believe it could make a pretty nice movie. The only thing I liked very much was author's manner of description of places and people's behavior and thoughts."
5,It works great...,"When I bought Barielle Nail Strengthener my nails were breaking and chipping. Ive tried other products and I have to say this one has worked the best. After a few months of use my nails are no longer breaking off. They are longer, stronger than they have been in a long time."
1,Received Wrong Product,"I purchased this item because it's for ""Sensitive Skin and Scalp"", but I received the regular Free & Clear conditional instead. Very disappointed."
2,No results yet,"A dermatologist recommended this shampoo to me for psoriasis. I haven't used it much or consistently. This may or may not be why I have yet to see any results for psoriasis. However, I don't think using it regularly would make a difference. We'll see. Hope I'm wrong."
3,May be for depressed girls,"I have watched most of Tyler Perry's films in the past and found most of them to be extremely entertainment. This film unfortunately isn't, it is downright depressing and boring. About a group of African American women in different stages of crises in their lives. A lot of viewers have enjoyed the film but I thought it was too maudlin for my tastes. 12/09/2011"
5,Tyler Perry just gets better and better...,"Superb! The actors were perfect for their roles. It was an emotional roller coaster ride. A little bit of something every woman could relate to. Two thumbs up! How does Tyler do it? He is a genius! A personal, poignant look at life and all the pains and perils of being a woman in a man's world."
5,For Colored Girls,My mom and me had seen this in the theater when it came out. My mom had to buy it when it came out on DVD. She loved this movie. I was surprised how fast it got here I ordered this second and expected it to come later but it got here faster than my other movie.
5,Powerful and Daring,Thank goodness a friend told me to read the book/poem first. I pass the same recommendation on to you.This film was very powerful. Tyler Perry tackled some extremely sensitive subjects in a very mature and thought provoking manner. The acting in this movie is in a class all its own. This movie is worth your time.
5,Multifaceted like a Diamond,"I absolutely loved this movie. I titled my review ""Multifaceted"" because Black women are multifaceted like diamonds. They are beautiful and come in all colors, are strong and endure. Some may be a little rough around the edges at first but if or when that precious gem finally shines through they are awesome.I also loved this movie because it didn't focus on one part of the Black female culture. It showed Black women who are successful, talented, trusting, naive, hopeful, bitter, religious, fanatic, loving, intelligent, insightful, wise, troubled and above all strong.I truly hope that critics don't take the title literally and label it as just a movie about Black women. The issues that the characters faced concerned all women. Any woman, Black, White, Hispanic, etc. can see a little bit of themselves in at least one of the characters. I saw a little of myself in at least three.Thank you Tyler Perry for bringing this wonderful story to the big screen."
5,Powerful Beyond Words,"Wow..Tyler Perry & his cast makes you feel for these women, if you can't relate. But, this is more than a movie its art in motion..with dance, poetry, and a beautiful soundtrack. If you haven't opened your mind to change, this will definitely give you several reasons why we all need to be more attentive towards one another. I'm so glad I purchased this movie instead of renting it. The poetry at times was a little too deep to grasp within that moment , so to watch & to listen closely, it will help you to grasp the full knowledge & understanding , as to where each colorful character was leading us to , and that is to the end of their rainbows. Then, I sat back & wondered how did I get over? Never alone."
5,Strong Ladies...,"I am glad they show this movie, it is exactly what I had been thru basically as a black girl. It ain't easy when you think abt sucidie but it ain't only 4 race. It can be intended to many different races, it was only showing that ppl can still forget what they been thru and make to end of rainbow. I did it but I am still trying."
2,It sucked,"I wouldn't purchase this again. When I got it, I didn't get a chance to finish watching it because it froze and it wouldn't play anymore."
3,Not for me,"At first glance, I thought this movie was going to be great. I did struggle however because I believe that this movie was only about black women living in the projects or ghetto. There were some seriously disturbing things in thus movie that I would have much better liked skipping all together. I did however love the art of the movie. Keep in mind, this review comes from a white girl and one without much cultural background at that."
2,Colored Girl,"The movie was tragic and depressing. I had no idea that the movie consisted of killing children. The rape part is a lesson to be learned about bringing someone to your home without really knowing them. However, the movie was too violent."
1,"Does TP think that most Black men are evil and most Black women pathetic, desperate and lonely?","More self-hating racist stereotypes... Beautiful actors with wonderful talents put into a macabre ""it sucks to be a Black woman in America, especially if you love a Black man TP Classic..."" Unlike his Madea series, at least he doesn't insult us with the hero coming in and rescuing the ""mad Black woman"" at the end. This movie is an emotional evisceration with no salve at the end. No point, no meaning... Spare yourself and pick up the original collection of poems..."
3,"Great Acting, Unfulfilling story","Excellent acting! You could not find a better cast of actresses to perform their roles in this movie. Their performances were magnificent - 5 stars! However, I was turned off with the continual negative theme throughout this movie that portrayed black woman in these unresolved plights. I'm uncomfortable with this holistic characterization of black women. I realize the title of the movie makes clear the storyline, but when you consider that Perry made a decision to deviate somewhat from the orginal version of the play, I had hoped to see some balance... some closure or remedy to some of these womens dilemmas. I left the theatre feeling depressed. I'm a fan of Tyler Perry's plays and most of his movies, however, this movie along with his movie ""Precious"" is just too dark for me."
1,"colors girls who straighten their hair, lighten their hair color, use contact lenses","For colors girls who straighten their hair, lighten their hair color, use contact lenses, etc, etc. Need I say more! Well if you are smart you get it! Horrible useless and senseless movie. I could go on; however I already wasted 90 minutes watching this movie."
5,Riveting,"Never underestimate the power of Tyler Perry. For Colored Girls is a must see for girls of all colors. Beautifully written, brilliantly performed."
2,"Odd, but not in a good way.","The movie was straight-up confusing! I know it was based on a play, so maybe it's better performed live. The poetry lost its power when I didn't realize it wasn't disjointed babble until a minute into each monologue."
3,Not Upbeat...But Good,"It's a pretty good movie. Just seems a bit too dark for far too long, given the depressing and troubling circumstances that continually surround all its main characters. Just took way too long for anything positive or enlightening to occur."
2,Oh My God,"When this movie was over, I felt like a wrung out dishrag! (I actually said,""WHEW"" when the credits rolled). If I'd seen it in the theater, I would have had to run out during one scene in particular that made me scream out loud AND cry. This movie makes all Black men look like so many bad things, except for 1 guy who was a cop. If I were to say any of the things the men do I'd be giving it away. But even men YOU DON'T SEE, that are just MENTIONED are horrible. This should scare any non African American women out of dating a Black man EVER. It made Black women look pathetic and helpless. I will say, everyone's ACTING was very good, and all the women looked very pretty. The directing was also good. One of the things you may find distracting was the way the regular dialogue would stop and they would talk in verse for a while. It's not a movie I'd want to see again because the subject matter is truly depressing."
3,"Good, but a bit heavy handed.","I like Tyler Perry, and like a lot of his movies, but the last few I've seen, seem to SCREAM in my face...""Do you get what I'm trying to say?"" instead of a more refined approach that leads the audience to the director's viewpoint without a slam to the head. Maybe he's not in touch with his audience and feels they need a firm hand in getting his message. Overall, the poems are beautiful, but break the heart at the same time. The film treatment could have been more subtle...and more successful."
5,FOR GIRLS,"THIS IS A MOVIE NOT ONLY FOR COLORED GIRLS OR GIRLS AT THAT THIS IS A MOVIE THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE, THIS IS A AWESUM AND A THINKER MOVIE. I LOVE THIS AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT THIS MOVIE GOT TO ME SO FAST ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER ORDERING IT."
5,Great Drama,"For Colored Girls has to be one of Tyler Perrry's greatest drama movies i've ever seen. This movie has alot of great actress including Janet Jackson and Whoopie Goldberg. I have never seen Whoppie play in such a Dramatic role, but she blew me away. Whoopie is one of the most talented Actress around. This movie was great. I have not yet seen a bad or horrible tyler perry movie and i hope i don't. This movie is based one a choreopoem called For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When The Rainbow Is Enuf. If you have not seen this movie yet then i recommend that you do, you won't be disappointed."
1,Lackluster,"Listening to this disk as a long-time Toto fan, I was disappointed. Lukather penned some good tunes for Toto, but you'll hear nothing like that on this disc. What you'll hear is depressingly bland guitar-rock. The sparkle that his songs had in Toto is gone--- gone like it had never been. If you want to hear Luke rip on some really good tunes, pick up Toto's Kingdom of Desire."
4,"A winner, but a 4 star since I'm a tough reviewer","I loved the cd. I was unaware of Lukathers' solo career. This was my first of his, but had many Toto. I have recommended this cd to friends and family. I highly recommend this cd to any fan of music. If you are aware of Toto, you know the quality work they do and have done throughout the years. Any ballad by Lukather is worth the price of the cd alone. I actually bought it and sent it out as stocking stuffers to family. If you buy a cd, buy this one. You will not regret it."
4,Luke's Pen now mightier than his sword.,"I notice that Luke has some co-writers on various songs.But if he is the motive force behind the lyrics, then he really is letting us see into his soul.His guitar playing, superb as always although conventional, is cast into relief by the strength and meaning of the words."
4,The best is not enough !!!,"Once God had a great idea : the creation of guitar. After it's creation he said : "" Now I need someone playng it !!"" . So before came Jimi hendrix, then Frank Zappa and last Steve Lukather. Now I think you're asking yourself :""What does this means with this statement ?"". Here's the answer: in the world there are few people which are able to play guitar and Steve is one of them ."
5,Save years of research,I needed this book before I accumulated the mountain of computer printouts and handouts that adorns my office. Buy it or spend the next 20 years of your life unnecessarily duplicating this research.
3,Good book,This is a good book for learning what to do upon discovering that you are gluten intolerant. Unfortunately I an also yeast intolerant so it makes things much more complicated. Good book for starting out though.
4,Solid Theoretical Framework,"The book provides both a framework and a set of the case studies of IT Outsourcing: subcontracting to a third party the implementation and maintenance of networks, software, support, backup etc.According to the framework presented in this book, IT Outsourcing allows a company to get rid of its non-key activities and allocate the resources to its main business. This allows the company to cut costs and be at the top of progress in the IT.The book covers the basic aspects of planning, negotiating, implementation, cooperation and termination of IT outsourcing. It covers all the issues: technical, economical, legal and so on.I recommend this book as a starting point to any manager who deals with IT, to broaden the views.Although the framework is good from the academic point of view, the examples are laid out in a manner that lacks variety, liveliness and brightness."
5,Visor CD Holder,"As described, nice. Fits well on visor and easy to get to disks. Nice storage on backside for money, notes, and pens. Biggest plus is it holds tight."
4,Works great.,Now that I've moved everything over to my iPod I use this holder for a handful of car mixes and greatest hits CDs I have as a backup. No complaints.
1,not pleased at all,"This is not the plant I ordered, as you can see by the picture.the plant was brigth green instead it was dark and smelled awful."
4,Very pleased,"I bought this plant to use for medicinal purposes. I knew it would be small but couldn't find any locally, so I ordered it and I have been very pleased. And it's grown like crazy! Would recommend."
3,Not quite what I expected,"If you look at the picture, you see a well-branched out plant in a little pot. The aloe vera plant I recieved was in a padded envelope with the root wrapped in a dry napkin. I'm sure the napkin was moist when it was shipped but it had dried out en route. The plant only had three stems branching out. It is trying to take root in a pot in my living room right now. I don't know if it will make it--so far no new growth."
5,Love it!,"it doesn't look much like the picture, not as bright green. Mine is about 4 inches tall at the longest stalk. It's doing great, new growth has appeared in the first two weeks. Also take note I got it between late August and early October.Also when it did first arrive, a lot ofo the small stalks had fallen off of the main stem, but the bigger ones stayed strong."
2,not so great,you could find nicer aloe at a near by store. this one is small and it came. Many of the aloe stems were damaged. i think i'll just throw it away and buy another one at the store near my house.
5,"Long, but well worth the time it takes to read.","I found this book to be rather long, but once you get into the ""guts"" of it, the time will fly, and you will say, ""Hey, it can't be over!"" I have never read anything by this author before and, quite truthfully, I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend this amount for a book. I usually read contemporary romance books that run about $4 or $5, but it is definitely a good read. I particularly enjoyed the sexual tension between the two main characters, Seth and Maggie, and I also was relieved to know that I didn't have to wade half-way through the book before they slept together. The storyline is not one that you haven't read before, but the writer puts a little ""twist"" into it to make it more intriguing, and I woulld guess, to make it a more lengthy novel. I enjoyed this book very much."
1,A waste of time,"I bought this book based on the rave reviews I read and was completely disappointed and incredulous that any company would even publish it. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were immature, not to mention the dialogue. I couldn't finish reading it which is a rare thing for me. I felt compelled to write my first review so that others wouldn't make the same mistake of wasting time and money on this book."
1,Not too good,"I was extremely disappointed in this novel. Dymond was way off in the descriptions of Moya and most of the crewmates, which leads me to believe he hasn't seen much - if any - of the actual show. During my reading, I felt as though it wasn't even about Farscape at all.The storyline was rather boring, and it dragged on into a long, confusing chain of events. I found myself wishing the book was over numerous times. It took a little effort to just pick it up again. However, I finished it anyway, as I felt odd abandoning something from my most favorite show.There are so many inconsistencies in the book, that it is almost an insult to the Farscape fans. I have actually read better fanfics online."
1,"Sorry to say, this book was bad","I give every book I read the benefit of the doubt, but I started to have problems in chapter one. The characterizations were completely off, which makes many pivotal moments of the book unbelievable. There were some good scenes but I can count those on one hand.There was one point near the end where the point of view switched to a character that we had never heard of before, right in the middle of the chapter. This is just one example of the poor construction of this novel.I loved the first Farscape book, and I appreciated that Keith R. A. DeCandido picked a point in the show timeline where the story could fit without causing conflicts. There is no way this could fit anywhere without disrupting the overall story arc.My husband and I both read the book, and we were both extremely disappointed. I don't understand how this got past the editiors."
1,Truly Awful Literature,"Granted Fan Fics rarely make this list of greatest written works, but this one was actually painful. Most of the previous comments about this book were right on the mark. Inconsistent facts, unbearable (if any) dialogue, mismatched personalities. And the icing on the cake is the fact that almost every memeber of the crew (Moya included) dies at least twice, only to be later revived through some miracle cure or another.Any maybe I'm being picky, but I doubt Farscape 1 could last very long in an extended firefight with dozens of gun skiffs."
1,Don't waste your money,"If I could, I would give this book 0 stars, but that wasn't an option! I read this book when it came out in the UK and was horrified that the powers that be at Farscape would allow this piece of ""dren"" to be published. I doubt that Andrew Dymond ever watched an episode of Farscape. He seemed to have missed the most basic of points, including what the interior of Moya looks like. He made it blue for Pete's sake! If you want a good Farscape novel, check out House of Cards by DeCandido, but DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT waste your money on this book."
1,"Sadness has reached new levels with this ""book""","I've read SF and Fantasy for over twenty years and I've watched every episode of Farscape. There are so many discrepancies the book should be made of Swiss cheese! I read the author's apology but really, to actually have to pay for this book is unbelievable. I read the first 100 pages, then began to skim along through page after page of tripe. The characterizations were iconic in their extremes. I got really tired of all of the Crichton-isms that NEVER stopped. D'Argo was portrayed as a mindless bloodthirsty savage, etc... Did the author watch the show...ever? I hope the publishers read these reviews, which have all been negative, and get a good SF writer to write the next one. I've read so many good Star Trek novels...what about David Gerrold? Bottom line to you other non-believers like me who thought the book couldn't be THAT bad...it is."
5,AWESOME,This CD Is The Best Single CD SHe Has Ever Put Out! It Comes With An Extra Box Thingy To Put CD 2 In! It RULES!
4,LUCKY CD SINGLE,Three tracks:* LUCKY [album version] (3:24)* HEART (3:00)* LUCKY [Jack B. Elliot Radio Mix] (3:26)
2,Not what I expected.,"This song gets old quick... you will love it in the first weekyou buy it but after that it will become extra baggage .You wantBritney, buy STRONGER instead. It is tiresome and franklyboring. 'Lucky , you are Britney's Weakest Link , Goodbye."
2,Glitter Pom Toy for Cats,"I bought these poms because we had 2 glitter poms that were given to us when we adopted our cat. They lasted a long time and just finally fell apart after a year of constant play. I was looking for something similar to replace them. Now about this product: These toys are approximately 2 inches around. The glitter on these toys is about 1/2 long, sheds terribly and the body of the pom is easily pulled apart. I didn't feel like this was a very safe toy for my cat, so I threw them in the trash."
5,Tuning for Dummies,"I'm a newbie to guitar playing, and have a Kona Acoustic/Electiric guitar. I tried to match the pitch of my guitar strings to Esteban on his DVDs, and I was having a tough time.A professional guitarist friend of mine suggested this tuner to me. Within minutes of placing the AX3000 on the face of my guitar near the neck, it took my just a few minutes to perfectly tune my guitar--and this was my first time with no one helping me.It attaches to your guitar easily, and comes off easily. Sabine makes tuning my guitar as simple as can be. From the other reviewer, I guess this tuner is less successful with electric guitars-I dunno.I can finally tune my guitar, but I still can't tuna fish."
3,Great for a six string; Not the right tuner for a 12 string,Purchased six weeks ago for use on seven acoustic guitars in my corral. It works very well on four six string acoustic guitars. It is not capable of accurate tuning for any of the three twelve-string guitars.
2,Asperger booklet,While this booklet is helpful its a bit dated and really should have cost less since its not as full as a regular book.
4,Seven days of creation,"Explained are the seven days of creation:- what does 'day' mean?- what happened in each of those days?Further, Steiner refers to the original Hebrew text and explains what the words mean;'day' - 'light' e.g. as names of Beings.In his explanation he also goes into forming of planetary system up to forming of planet Earth (so: Saturn age, Sun Age, Moon age (aka Lemurian age), Earth age (aka Atlantian age)) and explains how the spheres (= planets) were / consisted of.Really, Rudolf Steiner only explains Gen 1 and a bit about Gen 2; majorty of explanation of Gen 1."
4,Excellent - when you need it.,"It's one of those tool add-on's that you wish you had, if you run into a project that requires what this little item will do. While true that it's uses are limited, it will be a big help - when you need it. Great precision? No. You'll have to spend a good bit of time with setup and adjusting it just right for what you need. Once you set it right, it will pay off big in quality results.I have a lot of Dremel experience, and it's the exact same item, regardless of the brand sticker... I recommend it if you need a device of this type. Just think of it as a micro-router table, and basically all plastic instead of metal. It's plenty enough for those micro projects. You won't be running 2x4's through this!Always wear your safety glasses when using any high-speed tool!"
1,doen't work with dremel,"I purchased this for my husband's birthday. It looked like a well made item, but the reason I bought it was for his Dremel Rotary Tool...which doesn't fit on this.My husband returned it. I'm not sure what he's replacing it with."
4,"Great movie, great action.","This is the best adaptation I have seen from a fighting video game, to a movie. Action was good and entertaining. A good purchase!"
4,Average martial arts movie.,"Average acting, above average action sequences. The actors chosen for the roles were fairly close to the video game except Kazuya which does not even remotely resemble the video game character."
3,Gift,Was a gift for grandson and haven't heard what he thinks but it was on his Christmas list so guess he thinks it's good.
3,"Not great and not a dud, it;s Watchable..","The movie wasnt bad, the fights were good, but the story jumped around a little. Move did not suck, and was not amazing, but my review is watchable."
4,For fans of the game,This is a great movie for fans of the popular video game of the same name. Provides some great background into Jin and is overall a fun movie!
4,good if you're a tekken fan,"i love the tekken video games, so this was entertaining to see how some of the characters are handled in a live action movie as opposed to pure animation.if you're NOT a tekken fan, you'll probably be disappointed. the story line is cliche and most of the filming is too dark to really appreciate some of the details to the martial arts techniques. also, the fight scenes and moves are very digitally enhanced, so there's probably not much pure martial arts in here to draw fans outside of the video game fan base."
3,"Rather this than that ""Tekken 3D Movie""","I've pretty much been following the storyline of Tekken's video game. But I guess Kazuya had his ""dirt-bag switch"" on before Jin was born (as opposed to after).Hollywood, being Hollywood, took it's liberties and added a couple of ""Hollywood-style s*x scenes."" The film also had a few ""AW! THAT'S FAKED!"" moments. But the movie's not necessarily bad. Atleast the setting and plot were consistent enough.A nice attempt, though. Better than ""King of Fighters,"" WAY better than that second Street Fighter movie that featured Chun-Li."
5,tekken,"IMMA TEKKEN GAMER, BOUT TYME THEY MADE A MOVIE, BUT IT DIDNT HIT THA MOVIE SCREEN, IT ONLY WENT 2 THA DVD/BLU RAY....PRODUCERS COULD HAV IMPROVED THA ACTORS/ACTRESSES WIT THA SPECIAL POWERS LIKE N THA GAME.....BOTTOM LINE TEKKEN WAS OFF THA CHAIN....... ITS GONNA B TEKKEN 2 WAT IT ENDED....."
4,best video game/moive transfr so far,out of all the fighter movies made from games this might be as good or even the best one yet. its crazy how they got the characters to look likie the vg ones. the plot is as open as the games but thats what it should be. dont go throwing incrap that dpesntneed to bed there!
3,"Weak writing, but open to a (better?) sequel","I love the game, so that's why I ordered the movie. The writing is weak and I had higher hopes for the Tekken characters, but it was still an okay viewing experience. The fighting scenes are solid overall, with the exception of one (the one and only female fight-it sucked). Hopefully they'll make a sequel with a bigger budget, better writing, and more characters from the game.Basically, if you like playing Tekken, you should watch this once, though you may not feel compelled to go out and buy it."
2,don't buy,this movie messed up other stories and the main story with in TEKKEN. I wish I didn't spented my money on this and if i did i should have rented it first.
1,Item Pictured is not what Shipped Item was DIRTY and BENT OUT OF SHAPE,"The claw clipper that shipped did not not have the safety light and looked nothing like the picture. What I recieved was the most basic cheap claw clipper on the market. The back that stops the claw was bent backwards defeating its purpose. And it was alos dirty, not like an oil for the hinge but dirty and gross."
5,ANOTHER Aerosmith Greatest Hits?,"Ahh...another month, another Aerosmith Greatest Hits cd. It seems like these guys put out a greatest hits cd EVERY year. But, unlike past hit packages, this one hits the mark! There is not one single bad song on this 2 disc set. If you are an Aerosmith fan, this collection is DEFINATELY worth buying."
2,A Concerned Music Fan,"Ho-Hum. this band is really starting to BORE me....This is another example of Aerosmith playing it safe. ...Now don't get me wrong here,most of the songs here on this collection are classic Aerosmith songs, but most of your fans already have these songs and this package is treading old water and the new songs here are just to poppy for my tastes. ..."
2,Give it up,"5 stars for the first 10 tracks, 0 for the rest. If there is a pro drug use argument these guys are it. Their sober work makes Warrant and Trixter sound good. Pick up Get Your Wings, Rocks or Draw The Line and leave this swill on the shelf."
2,~ What ??? Another one ??? ~,"Having been a fan since the mid-'70s, and following the band through the ups, downs, and ups again, I feel somewhat qualified to say: ""What ??? Another ""Greatest Hits"" compilation ???""I'm afraid the lads appear to be milking the same cash cow yet again...sure, sure, I know there are two new tunes here, but is that enough incentive to buy this ?The answer is ""yes"" if you are the ""completist"" collector -however for the ""casual"" fan and observer who may have bought the fairly recent ""Anthology"" set, this newest release will most certainly come as somewhat of a dissappoinment.The guys have never been more on top of their game -all the more reason for a release of ALL NEW tunes... .I taped the two new songs off of a neighbor's CD, 'cause I darn sure ain't gonna get this one just for the 2 new songs or the marketing gimmick of the 4 different covers."
4,A Good Career Spanning Compilation,"This is what a compilation should be: a collection that spans the career of an artist, and gives the listener a good idea of what they have to offer, without being centered around one of two albums (doesn't Britney have a compilation?). Fortunately for me, this one was either lost or stolen, which gave me the perfect excuse to buy their albums! This compilation, combined with a great live show I attended, really got me into Aerosmith, and for that I am grateful. I limit my compilation ratings at 4/5, because they're designed to be all killer and no filler. This one is...it's not a standard studio album to that effect, but it's the best compilation I've ever owned."
3,Great! - But not the best !,"This is a great recopilation of Aerosimith. But it is not the best. If you are an Aerosmith fan im sure you buy their last album: Just Push Play and without a doubt the Armagedon soundtrack. If it so, you dont need to buy This cd. I recomend you the ""Young Lust: Aerosmith Anthology"" (34 tracks). Is a lot better and have all the ""Oh Yeah"" songs and more: like ""Monkey on my Back"" and ""Hole in My Soul"", my personal favorite that you can not found in ""OH Yeah"". It contain 5 live tracks icluing ""Dream On"" and ""Sweet Emotion"". So if youre a truly fan check out and go and buy Aerosmith Anthology."
5,Classic Rock All The Way,Just bought the new Aerosmith CD O' Yeah. The title says it all. O'YEAH!!! What a great CD. If you're looking for some great music with a lesson on how to play rock. This is it... This is where it begins.
5,Aerosmiths Best Yet,"Being a big Aerosmith fan, I just baught this album today, I havent been able to stop listening to it. I recommend it to anyone, it has all Aerosmiths greatest hits (their ultimate hits). It has the songs in order of debut from Mama Kin and Dream On to Jaded and Lay it Down, Aerosmiths best greatest hits album. Just for the casual listener."
4,Great rock cd by a a great rock band,"The O yeah ultimate Aerosmith hits is trully their greatest hits 2 cd set. It has mutiple songs I grew up listening to because of my parents playing it in the house and in their car. If you enjoy your Aerosmith then this 2 cd set will be perfect for yourself, it has 30 songs which I personally enjoyed 21 out of the 30 songs they put on this 2 cd set. CD one has Dream On, Sweet Emotion, Angel, Rag Doll and Janie's Got a Gun just to name a few. CD 2 is more modern stuff like for example Livin on the Edge, Cryin, Amazing, The other side which has a great guitar riff in it, and last of course they put I don't want to miss a Thing. But one of my personal favorites near end of the second cd is their pair up with Run DMC to redo Walk This Way."
2,The ultimate sellouts,"The only reason this even gets two stars is for the inclusion of those great 70's songs. Their presence sadly reminds us just how bad they've gotten in the last 15 years. The 70's stuff was the sonic equivelent of New York City. Since then it sounds like they went to the mall for an orange julius and decided to stay there.How they went from ""Rocks"" to their current status as [insipid] jokers who specialize in bland ""rockers"" and ballads is one of the greatest falls in rock music. Their up-tempo stuff is about as threatening as Chad Lowe putting on boxing gloves."
1,sucks,"These guys were alright when they were on heroin, but have really sucked since rehab...and that was two decades ago. Go sell a truck guys."
3,"All the songs you want, but not the quality","This two-disc SACD has every song you would want from Aerosmith...spanning the earliest hits to the most recent.However, my opinion is to save your money for regular CD quality. I'm not an extensive SACD listener, but what I do have sounds better than this. The fact that it is only stereo and not multi-channel hurts it, and I don't see the point of the SACD. But if you love Aerosmith, this is the one (two) CD you need."
2,OVERPLAYED,"I had enough of Aerosmith for a while. I HEAR THEM ON EVERY RADIO STATION IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE JUST AS OVERPLAYED AS LEDZEPPELIN, AND THE ROLLING STONES. WHY DO I NEVER HEAR GOOD BANDSLIKE DIRE STRAITS ON THE RADIO? DON'T BUY THIS OVERPLAYED COMP.EXPRESSO LOVE."
2,What a heap of garbage,"This album gets two stars for the 70's classics and 0 stars for that [stuff] they started producing in 1987, just after the fabulous ""Done with Mirrors."" Aerosmith was a hard rocking, sleazy, gritty rock n roll band in the 1970's that was on track to be as great as the stones, however drug use and the desire to go commercial and cash in on it killed them. For this album to be 5 stars, it would need to be a double disc collection comprised of their great 1970's records, if you like the new stuff, I find it hard to believe you could have ever listened to the old stuff."
2,"Hardcore Punk Version of ""Don't Wanna Miss"" & More!","Rumor has it that the boys from Beantown were planning a revolutionary sort of greatest hits collection -- their best songs re-done by the band in a totally different genre. Ballads turned into buzzsaw rock. Stomping classics given a hip-hop or jazz treatment. Ernie 'Monk' Marks even played the loungy version of ""Back in the Saddle"" on his radio show and alluded to a ""hardcore"" remake of ""Don't Wanna Miss a Thing."" Sadly, somehow all that was abandoned and this lame, run-of-the-mill collection came out instead. As is, it makes a case for Aerosmith once being great, then becoming commercially savvy and then becoming really, really bad."
3,gREAT,"I'll give this CD 3 stars because overall this is a pretty goodcompilation but and I dont like Steven Tyler much because he screams, he is a nice guy in ""Seasons of Wither"", Same Old Songand Dance"", & ""Janie's Got a Gun"". Buy it anyway."
5,Aerosmith-A compilation with a view,"This collection of 70's, 80's, and 90's greatest hits has everything one would want in preserving life as we knew it in the past. Listening to the band belt out songs gone-but not forgotten-takes us through the decades of multi-colored wear, big hair and the years of the bands. This compilation is so great, I would buy another copy just for backup.I love being reminded of the movie hits like ""Dude looks like a lady"" and ""I don't want to miss a thing"" which has you swaying and jammin' where ever you are. Don't miss this compilation. Aerosmith definitely has a smash with this one."
4,"Not a perfect collection, but how could it possibly be?","The only problem I have with this set is how in the world did ""Lay it Down"" make it while ""Toys in the Attic"" did not? At any rate this is a great set. Also missing is one of my favorites, ""Hole in my Soul"" from ""Nine Lives"". I love these guys, and my love for their music was renewed ever since ""Pump"" came out. ""Amazing"", which tells their story of recovery from substance abuse, is inspiring. Tyler's vocals are always incredible, and to me Joe Perry is the greatest guitarist who ever lived. Long live Aerosmith."
5,Great Compilation CD!,I have enjoyed this CD immensely! It has all of the best Aerosmith songs. It's a great value for 30 songs.
3,Finally! 30 yrs of the groove.,"This is the first Aerosmith ""greatest hits"" album to include the music from the band's drug days as well as their sober days. The ""Greatest Hits"" of 1990 and ""Big Ones"" of 1994 are both fine retrospectives, but they aren't all-inclusive. ""Gems,"" ""Classics Live,"" ""Live! Bootleg,"" ""Pandora's Box"" were usually pretty good compilations. ""A Little South of Sanity,"" another live album, was great for the mere reason that it included songs from Aerosmith's whole career. However, the band still had not put out a definitive greatest hits of their classic studio recordings. This makes ""Oh Yeah!"" all the more welcome. Plus, it is two discs long! Yes yes, good stuff."
5,An amazing tribute to a legendary band,"Aerosmith's definitive greatest hits collection is staggering. It's unbelievable that these guys have had so many hits over such a large span of time. It's also great to see lesser-known ""Ultimate Hits"" like Big Ten-Inch Record, Seasons Of Wither, Mama Kin, and even Deuces Are Wild included on the collection. Would have been nice to see songs like Train Kept A Rollin', Toys In The Attic, and Come Together on the set as well, but I guess that's what the Japanese import is for (includes those tracks). Every other song is imbedded in American rock 'n' roll history and a must for any true rock fan. OH, YEAH!!!"
2,Schizo Hits,"Guess the snarling ""Sick as a Dog"" and the frenzied ""Toys in the Attic"" were deemed just too scary for the fans who get all weepy to ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" And that's the problem with this umpteenth 'greatest' collection. The band doesn't realize how schizophrenic its recorded history really is, how just plain wrong it is to put rock icons ""Walk This Way"" and ""Back in the Saddle"" on the same slab as witless ditties like ""Crazy."" At least one of the new tunes flashes some of the ole funky fun, but come on -- how many paydays does this once great group need before it recovers its self-respect?"
5,They a have all the hits except 2!,"This CD has all of Aerosmiths gratest hits, except Nobodies Fault and Kings and Queens. If you like the albums ROCKS or Draw the Line the best, you might miss these songs, but otherwise it has got all the hits like Dream On, Mama Kin, Seasons of Wither, Walk This Way, Sweet Emotion, Back in the Saddle, Last Child,etc. I don't thing they should have put big 10 inch record, but they did. They have all the later hits as well, like pink, dude looks like a lady,angel etc. I also wish they put their version of Come Together as well."

3,Mama kindlin',"Yawn, another chronological greatest hits package...pity they didn't pull a Pink Floyd and just pushed ""shuffle"" on the mixing board to draw new lines between the same old songs and dancing. What's next, a compilation of their covers? Hey, not a bad idea:""Walking The Dog""""Train Kept A Rollin'""""Big Ten-Inch Record""""Milk Cow Blues""""Think About It""""Reefer Headed Woman""""I Ain't Got You""""Rattlesnake Shake""""Mother Popcorn""""Remember (Walking in the Sand"")""Come Together""""I'm Down""""Helter Skelter""""Rockin' Pneumonia (and the Boogie Woogie Flu)""""Red House""""Cry Me a River""""All Your Love""""Strangers in the Night""""Love Me Two Times""""The Star-Spangled Banner""Throw in their TV spot for the Gap, and maybe one of their live Zeppelin excursions, and we got us some toys in the attic worth playing with."
1,Congratulations!!!,"Congratulations,Aerosmith!!! Because of you, I have forsaken rock-n-roll music completely. Because of you, I don't even bother to tune into FM radio anymore. Your gutless, bland, and heartless anthems have totally, completely, and irreversibly ruined rock-n-roll music for me forever. You are absolutely the nadir of creative expression, and I am speaking for countless millions when I implore you to cease and desist!!!"
2,Aerosmith.......Overrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time. They only made 3 decent songs in Same old song and Dance, Seasons of wither, and Janies got a gun. Rest of the songs just stink explosively. Avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band, steven tyler screams, he can't sing at all??? this is music for drug addicts."
1,Aerosmith SUCKS!,"Aerosmith were always bad. The singer don't know his name just screams. This isn't music, just noise. They are also overrated,and overplayed. This is one rock band that every rock fan mustAVOID! Go get THE BEATLES,or even better DIRE STRAITS.WORST ROCK BANDS OF ALL TIMEAC/DCAEROSMITH"
3,Ultimate? I think not,"Everytime a great band comes out with a ""hits"", or ""best of"" compilations. There is always going to be that fan that says there is missing tracks.I really need to know who put this 2 disc together. I have heard it countless interview with Steven Tyler that he thinks the best song Aerosmith has done was ""Kings and Queens"" and that is nowhere to be found on this set. I'm not going to complain about all the newer crap that is on here, because that is what sells and if that is what is most important to these guys now that they are into their 60's, they will have to live with that.With this set, you get some good aerosmith songs, but calling this ultimate is sad"
5,The Greatest Band Of All Time,"I got this CD not very long ago and I listen to it non stop.Aerosmith is the greatest rock band of all time with manymany great hit singles ""THIS CD IS FOR YOU"""
2,Left These Songs Off?,"What in hell! How could they leave these songs off this CD? Toys in the Attic, No More No More, Kings and Queens, Remember (Walking in the Sand), Hole in My Soul. Wow! Ridiculous and senseless to leave out these classics!"
1,Again?,"Don't they have enough greatest hits already? Is that how they make more money in between albums? This album has already been put out, just with a different name and a different cover......about thirty times already!Don't get me wrong, I love Aerosmith and these are good songs, but I think it's a pathetic attempt to make money. I'm sick of all the greatest hits. That's why I give this 1 star. If they had've re-recorded all these songs and gave them all a more modern sound then that would've been cool. But please spare us with the same cd's!"
5,A very happy Mum,I bought this for my Mom for her birthday. She loves it. It is her wind down cd that she leaves in her car and listens to very loud. She had me program Aerosmith on her cell phone as her ring. The best of Aerosmith.
3,"Come on, already","I've been waiting for a CD set to come out that finally put all of my favorite Aerosmith songs together...and I'm still waiting. After how many ""best of"" CD's now? At least half a dozen. Come on guys!!"
1,JUST SAY NO!,"This is just another collection slapped together to gouge Aerosmith's fans. 10 years ago I would have wasted my money on this and the Young Lust collection despite having virtually every song 2 or 3 times on CD anyway.It's a shame that record companies are destroying some of the best talent out their by continuously repackaging, recycling, and reissuing the same songs over and over again. And just to make sure our biggest fans buy this, we'll include two new mediocre songs that Steven Tyler composed in a couple of days using ProTools.Do yourself a favour, pick up their studio albums (even the new ones) and find out what you're missing--real rock and roll. I can't wait until Aerosmith finishes their SONY contract and starts to chart their own direction again."
4,An alright collection,"Aerosmith is my favorite band so when I buy a greatest hits I want the greatest hits! This collection is better then the others but is still missing songs like ""Kings And Queens, ""Train Kep A Rollin'"" ""Nobodys Fault"" ""Remeber Walking In The Sand"" ""Come Togerther"" ""Eat The Rich"" ""Hole In My Soul!"" Another thing that wears this collection down is the remixes like ""Pink"" ""Draw The Line"" ""Just Push Play"", Now when these songs were a hit it was the songs not the remixs so why put those on here for? But if you are a new Aero fan get this but make sure you get the albusm to cause there much better , because although all the songs on here kick...they forgot a few!"
5,GREAT!,What can you say about Aerosmith except that they are one of the greatest bands of all time and this CD is no doubt one of the best greatest hits albums there is.
1,This is the Anti-Greatest Hits Collection? Who put this together?,"As other reviews have mentioned, all the classic material from the band's heyday is absent.....How you could issue a collection and not have Toys in the Attic is beyond me.........What a let down...they should have called this Greatest Hits from the bands reunion...forward. Way, way too many tracks on here that had outside writers...I want to hear Aerosmith, not writers...that's what Country music is for.Check out the Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded Cd for some great american rock and roll.All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
5,Definite Aerosmith,"""O,Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits"" is definite Aerosmith. I have been an Aerosmith fan for a long time, and I can think of nothing better than a box set with great Aerosmith music for more than two hours. None of the songs on this box set are bad. The best things about this box set are two new bonus tracks (""Girls of Summer"" and ""Lay it Down""), the South Beach mix of ""Pink"", the radio remix of ""Just Push Play"", and the version of ""Walk This Way"" Aerosmith performed with Run-D.M.C. But even though those bonuses are the best part of the whole box set, the best song is ""Angel"" because the lyrics, music, and singing are pretty. If you like Aerosmith, then this boxset is for you."
5,Dream On,A great collection of Aerosmith hits. Good quality remixing of old recordings and excellent quality of more recent digital age recordings from one of the greatest rock groups ever.
4,missing some good songs but worth a buy,if you dont own any aerosmith and want a group of their best music then this is the cd for you. i have givin it a 4 star because it is missing some good songs.
3,"Opps, They Did It Again!","You'd think that after umpteen Greatest Hits releases from these guys (we've come to expect at least one or two per year now, and do we really need a new best of every single time Aerosmith puts out a new CD?), they'd get it right. Well, there are a lot of great songs here, mostly the same stuff they always compile with two new ones and the singles from ""Just Push Play"", which makes overall for their best collection to date. While I enjoy having ""Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" on an Aerosmith collection and truly appreciate the inclusion (Finally!! What took so long?) of ""Seasons of Wither"", I will never, ever understand why we always get the mediocre ""Mama Kin"" and ""Big Ten Inch"" when the certified classics ""Sick As A Dog"" and ""Toys In The Attic"" are omitted. So, while this is definitely worth a listen if only because Aerosmith is one of America's greatest rock and roll bands, I'll have to pass until someone finally gets it right."
1,doesn't cut it,"I lived next to these guys in Boston and before their contract with Columbia, there best song was a cover of ""Train Kept A Rollin' (made famous by the Yardbirds). That was Stevie and Joe at their primal best. I was disappointed it wasn't included in the original single CD of GREATEST HITS. However, leavin' it off this double CD is real disappointing. THUMBS DOWN"
4,OverRated?,"I'll give this CD a 4 star because I don't really like StevenTyler much, because he sure screams a lot, between Aerosmith andLed Zeppelin are the two most overrated bands with the singerscreaming a lot. If you want a better compilation, buy Guns N'Roses and Foreigner insted. They dont have a bad scream like these 2."
4,Small and Simple,"The light is compact and lightweight. It hasn't broken after a fair amount of heavy shock and vibration from aggressive city/downhill riding. Puts out enough light, but isn't extremely bright. I would recommend it to someone looking for a light that is small, durable and unobtrusive. I'm using it on a soft tail XC mountain bike."
3,All Things Considered Theme,"here's something interesting; the 3d movement of the de Lange Symphony contains the theme of the NPR radio program, ""All Things Considered"". Just a coincidence surely."
4,The Seascape Painter's Problem Book,"I have been an oil painter for many years, animals and landscapes, I am learning to do seascapes now and this book is very helpful."
5,Older Volume - Timeless Material - Well Presented,"Just received my used copy of this classic from Goodwill. Very pleased after initial viewing. There are more then enough color plates to get a very good sense of the artists color palette in a wide variety of seascapes. The bulk of the instructional photos are black and white and convey the tonal values very well without distracting the student with colors that could vary considerably anyway. The emphasis of each section is on a specific ""problem"" as in ""Rocks And Falling Water"", ""The Background Sea"", ""Skies"", ""The Major Wave"" etc. Great insights into all. Will not lead you by the hand, stroke by stroke, however."
2,colour !,"Where is the colour please ??? and I paid a very high price for it ! Very good painter, very bad book about illustrations !"
1,Wrong wiper blade,"Somehow when I searched for a wiper blade refill for my 1996 Chrysler Town and Country , Amazon's search took me to this Wiper Blade . Well , I finally got around to putting it on and it IS THE WRONG WIPER REFILL for my Town And Country . I guess I got SCREWED AGAIN ! ! Amazon needs to do some work on their search engine ! !"
2,Beware fitment Honda Odyssey 2008,"I just received these inserts and was surprised to learn that they aren't exactly the proper width. I read some other reviews that stated these were the wider refills and would work but mine did not - maybe I was shipped the narrow wipers. Either way, I got them mounted and tried them only to find that they fail to wipe much of the windshield. Off to try something else.amazon did say this will fit my vehicle"
4,2006 Honda Accord,"This wiper blade refill was used for a 2006 Honda Accord Hybrid, driver-side replacement. The first time I replaced the wiper blade for this vehicle a year ago, I found that there is are very specific fittings for the metal wiper blade assembly for this car. Hence, I ended up removing the rubber-like refill, and using that in the OEM metal wiper blade holder, and tossing the new metal wiper blade. Rather than waste time and add to landfill, this time I used this refill. It solved the annoying chattering across the windshield problem, and took about 10 minutes to install."
3,"General, is too soft.","Than my old car wiper to soft, graphite is there, my hands are installed after dark, but the reasons are too soft, not too close to the glass that I want to dismantle the old wiper spring on a replacement."
3,"Hey Honda owners, go see your dealer","I searched for about a week on-line and at car parts stores for a refill for my 2009 Honda Civic EX sedan wiper blades but like others have stated, while the length is okay, the width is usually not, so the fit is never quite right. Then I thought to check with the parts department of my local Honda dealer and they had ones that fit perfectly and worked like a charm (and at only about $6 each, the price was surprisingly affordable). The refills are only the silicone portion so you do have to remove the metal supports from the old wiper and insert them into the new one but the whole process is easy and quick taking only a few minutes. For the DIFM (do it for me) crowd, I'd be surprised if the dealer wouldn't perform the replacement free of charge. Plus, you usually can't go wrong with OEM parts."
1,Does not fit OEM wiper arm.,"I received this item and it does not fit in the factory wiper arm. I checked PIAA's website for fitment and this is the one they say will fit my 2006 Acura TSX but it does not fit. I also received the 16"" wiper refill(part # 94040) and it fits fine. The 26"" refill is 8mm wide and the 16"" refill is 6mm wide so obviously that is the problem. I returned the one that does not fit which was very easy with Amazon's easy returns."
1,Wiper blade MIGHT have been ok if it fit,"Based on the amazon.com information, the PIAA 94055 22"" and PIAA 94065 26"" were ordered as wiper blade refills for my original equipment wipers on my Honda 2008 Civic LX.Unfortunately, both blades were too narrow to fit securely in the wiper arms. The wipers expect 10mm wide blades, and these were 6mm and 8mm wide. The length was NOT a problem.So both blades were returned for amazon credit.If amazon have provided ACCURATE information on the blade width, the blades would have never been ordered. The parts ""wizard"" that claimed the blades would work for my vehicles was also inaccurate.Unless amazon changes their information about the blades, Make SURE you know the blades will fit BEFORE ordering.A 1-star rating had to be given due to the amazon issue, not because of the actual product."
2,wiper blade,"Beware, wiper blade leaves streaks on windshield. Very distracting at night with lightsfrom oncoming traffic. Recomend Graphite or rubber."
1,Does not fit Honda Accord 2008,"Amazon is incorrect in stating that this fits the 2008 Honda Accord EX-L 4-cyl, Sedan. Blades are thin and cheap, not nearly as good as OEM."
1,Does NOT fit. Does NOT work.,"This was one of the wiper refills recommended for the Honda Odyssey 2008. However, the refill does not fit correct, does not wipe completely and make a flapping noise when turned on.The problem is that the refill does not confirm to the curvature of the windshield. I tried to make it work by bending the refill myself and it still does not work.I will NOT recommend this product to anyone.-V"
4,a definite hit,"love the quality and the cost, pretty easy to set up. took about an hour. lots of features for the price. i am using on a home office network, so connection was a little more tricky, good help on the product support page (www.samsung.com).i would not hesitate to purchase this again :)"
2,Boring and memior-like,"Granted, I only read 60 pages. Granted, it might get more exciting further into the book. However, I quickly grew tired of the memior-like style of the story, which lacks imagination in recreating Darwin's early 20s. I can tell where Stone is pulling directly from Darwin's writings, letters to and from family members, and musings in his diary. If I wanted that in a book, I'd read a biography; this is a novel. Conversation comes across as stilted and unnatural, with ... thrown in at odd places. I know many of you out there are fans of Stone, but this one doesn't quite make it as a historical/biographical novel. It lacks imagination."
5,Must read,"In the last few years, so many memoirs and stories have been written by Iranians and published in English (mostly by Iranian women). It looks like the market is hot for these titles. This has resulted in publication of many disingenuous works that are politically reactionary and artistically inferior (such as Reading Lolita in Tehran).""The Mullah with No Legs and Other Stories"" is politically progressive (even though it does not directly deal with politics) and artistically superb. It is a personal journey of an Iranian boy written with an excellent humor and wit. The stories are mostly sad, but you can't stop laughing! This book reserves recognition. Read it! (I have heard that the author's name is a pen name. I don't know why he did not publish this work with his real Persian name.)"
4,A definite improvement,"Got a fair price($185). Local shop wanted $100 more + $1000 to install. From all the install's I read about on a Ranger forum many people said they installed in 8 hours. I did this completely alone & it about 28 hours. Seems every bolt holding the bumpers or body to the frame was rusted & lock tighted & required heat & some serious blood sweat & tears. I finally came to the conclusion that an impact wrench may be worth the investment, So I purchased one for $119 & the seemingly impossible became possible. The truck looks great after the 3"" lift & 285/75/R16 Cooper STT tires installed for an overall gain of about 7"". Was going to buy a new ""cooler"" truck but after investing $1400 for the lift kit, tires & front window tint. I have a new, cooler truck, What a difference?"
2,"Uhhh, I'm not sure","The top of this is kinda cute but the bottom is made out of some older looking material and the bottom brown color is really blah. It comes about 2 sizes too small, so if you are like a 16 then order a 20 or 22."
2,"artwork is best yet, stories leave much to be desired","this volume has great artwork, you can really see the progression of belore as an artist throught the 4 volumes in the series. unfortunately it seems all his effort went into the art and very little into thinking up sexy plotlines. yes, most people are interested in the graphics over the story, but for these works to truly be erotic there must be some imagination in the plot. these stories have very little. there is nothing new here that distinguishes it from the previous volumes, in fact its a step backwards in my opinion. volumes 2 and 3 are the best of the 4 volumes. do yourself a favor and get them before you buy this one."
3,"It's okay, but not great","The art is black and white throughout. Some of the art is done VERY well. Mostly, this is just done in a style that doesn't get my motor running. There isn't a lot of really ""kinky"" stuff, but lots of the scenes have a bit more of a fetish flavor than I really care for. It isn't bad, but it's not my sort of thing."
5,art,This book made me want to pay more attention to art. I love the full naked woman with tattos on the cover of this book.
5,This CD needs a better description!,"The description of this CD does not represent what you get. cd1= Zeitgeist (original version) cd2= remixes of the more popular songs cd3= video cd of 3 hits. It is kind of like a mini box set w/o the box. If you like German trance, you will enjoy this one!"
2,Picture deceiving,Did receive this product on second order. The band is not nearly as wide as it appears on the image. It is slightly wider than the football shown.
3,Rug Gripper,I have bought rug gripper before but this time the product I received didn't seem to stick as well as it had in the past. I don't know if the rug gripper was old and lost some of the stickiness. One of the rugs I used the rug gripper on moved constantly so I just took off the rug gripper. I recently ordered the ruggies for my carpets to see how they will work to keep the carpets from moving. Disappointed with this product.
5,Good substitute for Chex Mix,"This is great for a gluten, corn, soy and casein free cheesy cracker. The orange color and spice mix really fools you into thinking you're eating a cheddar flavored cracker. This is our replacement for goldfish crackers and cheesy chex mix."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I'm desperate for a goldfish/ cheezit replacement and this isn't it! The taste is just OK, but the appearance really is a turn-off. My husband said these crackers look like dog food. My kids wouldn't even try them. I really WANTED to love these!"
5,One of the best written books from Walter Farley,"I bought (with my allowance) and read, in order, all of Walter Farley's books starting when I was 8 years old. The Island Stallion was by far my favorite of all the books and the one that I read over and over. I am 28 now and I plan to buy the complete set for my son when he's old enough to read since most of mine have been lost over the years."
2,rings familiar,"Hmm...a lonely young boy who loves horses just happens upon an exquisitely beautiful, amazingly fast wild stallion (with marks of Arabian blood in spite of his immense size) that is eventually tamed by the boy, but always remains wild...Now where have I heard that before?Farley might as well have titled this one ""The Black Stallion (But he's a chestnut now, and Alec changed his name to Steve)""."
3,Island Stallion,I was disappointed that this edition did not contain the illustrations that I had in my book from my childhood.
5,Fantastic Book!!!,I think that Steve and Pitch were pretty lucky to find a way out of those caves into the interior of Azul Island. This book is the opposite of The Black Stallion because Steve rescued his horse and Alec was rescued by his horse. I think that this was wonderfully written and I enjoyed it beyond description. THIS BOOK IS A MUST!!!
3,"not what I wanted, but satisfying","I don't exactly know what I was looking for out of this book, but in the end, I found it. The plot line was not all that spectacular or origional, but i found myself completely adoring the characters. Janice is absolutely fabulous and 3 dimensional and many can relate to both Janice's life, as well as Cliffords."
5,More great music from Potter,"Chris Potter, ever since his original 1994 release, has shown the jazz world that he is without a doubt the future of the music. Each CD that he has released has shown many different sides to the music, and ""Underground"" is an addition to this mix. Last year's ""Lift"" showed the intensity of the Potter Quartet in a more traditional sense, and this new release follows ""Traveling Mercies"" as a return to more ""fusion"" based compositions, but has different vibes altogether, particularly due to the roster change.The bottom line is, if you've enjoyed Potter's playing in the past, buy this new record-- you'll see another whole side to his seemingly infinite creative genius."
1,Disappointed!,Please note that this is not a toy and only made for train sets. I was not aware of how small the item would be and that it was for a train set. The two that I purchased were also broken. I purchased two for my nephews for Christmas and will have to return them as they cannot play with them. Very disappointed that it was made clear.
1,dont waste your money,"...this is NOT 12ga wire...its 14ga...(19yr electrictian)the wire connections was corroaded at the connection...i had to replace the ends with some shorter spare cables i had...one wouldnt plug in, so i just replaced them all"
2,"Cable OK, arrived with connection broken","Ordered 2 cables. One arrived with a broken connection on one end. Not sure if this was defective product or in shipping.Anyway, I fixed it myself by stripping the wire and re-attaching the end connector. Now works OK but its too bad that I needed to fix a brand new cable!"
5,Don't plan on sleeping for two days - you'll stay up reading,"This book had it all - surprise twists, a heroine who goes after ideals and sticksto them, characters you care about, and some romance. It isa very quick-paced book not bogged down with a lot of legalese,but enough to make it credible. I found myself rooting forthe characters to make it at different times. The ending wasgreat - not at all what I expected."
2,Slow Starter,"This being my first Nina Reilly book I wanted to start off with the initial book in the series, and as a result I have none of their other books to compare it with. They are no Grisham, that's for sure. Book starts out really slow and took much effort on my part to stay with it until it started to get good (when the trial started.) Almost no character development imho but interesting characters are part of the story. I should disclose that I am a trial attorney of some 30 years and with over 100 civil and criminal trials to my credit so my appreciation of the book (or lack thereof) may differ from a layperson's. I didn't even come close to figuring it out by the way. Despite my somewhat lukewarm reaction to this book I have ordered another one in the series, willing to give them another try. I am hoping that they improve as they go along."
3,A Good First Book,A little slow if you are used to Grisham but definitely fun and worth reading. Hopefully the next Nina Reilly novels speed up.
2,Good idea bad book,"I was intruged by the concept behind this book, and the book starts out fairly good, but the qaulity of the book drops quickly. Plot holes, bad dialoge, and bad pacing make the book virtually unreadable. Look elsewhere."
2,motion to express boredom,"sloppy,imprecise prose. 300 painful pages to get to the trial. by then,it's hard to care.without depth or pacing.a chore to complete."
3,The narration sucks,"I'm not sure about the quality of the book, because I can't get past how bad the narration of Ms. Merlington is. She rushes through her words. She rushes conversations between characters, so that you can't tell who is talking. She has no sense at all of the dramatic. When a murder attempt is made on Nina, the narration just blithly continues as if she is just walking down Main street at noon. I'd like to give O'Shaughnessy another chance, but I pray that Ms. Merlington doesn't narrate any future books."
3,"promise, but sloppy","As others have mentioned, the plot starts ok, but peters out at the end. A courtroom confession--gimme a break. Research is weak--Temple in NY, McCarron in Reno, boats with odometers, sailing to Hawaii in a 22 footer, lack of understanding of gambling. It all takes away from the ability to believe the story."
4,A 'who dunnit' that kept me guessing until the end,"I would hate to chose whether I liked the colorful characters, suspense, mystery, locale or courtroom drama the most. Perri O'Shaughnessy delivers! Better than Sue Grafton. If you have been disappointed with the last 5 John Grisham novels as I have, you'll love this series!"
4,Great and Fast Shipping,"I especially appreciated the fast shipping time, I gave 4 stars because I believe this item was a touch overpriced."
1,Great for torture,"As if this cd wasn't bad enough, but he had to include a duet with the ""King of the Agonizingly Painful, Balls in a Vice-grip voice"" Michael Bolton. And Kenny G is the only saxophonist who can make a tenor sax sound like a soprano sax. Where is the soulful tenor sound? It is so hard to decipher what songs are played on soprano and what songs are played on tenor. It all sounds the same. As one reviewer has already stated, there is no life in this album. It is bland, soulless, and will make you take up smoking, drinking and biting your nails. I have had it on for less than 5 minutes now, while I an reviewing it, and I'm already a nervous wreck...it has that effect on me. I'm going to end now, so I can turn it off .. it's making me mental!"
5,Reflecting back...,"I once had a bestfriend back in '89/'90 that I considered to be my soulmate. He listened to a variety of music...rock, jazz, etc. One of his favorite artists was Kenny G and one of his favorite cd's was this one. One day he and I shared a quiet moment listening to this cd. 'Home' came on and the room took on a feel that I can't explain and haven't felt since. He whispered to me 'when I hear this song it makes me think of you'. 'When I'm with you I feel 'home'. It's as if the song & the moment spoke for themselves. My bestfriend is no longer with me. Now, this song always makes me think of him.I have seen Kenny G in concert about 10 times. Each time he has started his concerts with 'Home' ~ my favorite song. That song moves me like no other. To hear it live is nothing like the original recording. I could care less what others opinions are of Kenny G. That man is phenomenal live. He plays for the people...not just to the people. This cd is a beautiful recording."
1,"""Live""?",What a misnomer. There is no life to this music. This man hasn't played an inspiring note in almost ten years. The worst part of this is is that many people think this is jazz. It's like going to Paris and eating at a McDonald's.
1,We call it soul - it's not here,"Anyone who can make a tenor saxophone sound that sharmy doesn't deserve to play it. This is 73 minutes of awful playing on Kenny G's part, along with duets with Michael Bolton (the vocal equivalent). If you like this, I think you are buying it for the name only - the music is awful."
1,.....Ugh!!!,Now just imagine your in a supermarket and every time themusic stops the customers applaud.Welcome to hell!
5,Kenny G Live CD,I love this CD. Kenny G's songs are ALL beautiful. I use this CD to walk or relax. One of his best.Amazon sent it in record time.
5,LIiiiiiiiiiiiiive !,"I had that recording on a tape (yes, a tape !). It was given to me by my Saxophone teacher ... I listened to it, and listened to it, but then I switched to a CD player, and couldn't listen to it anymore (who listens to music with a walkman nowadays ???), so I looked and looked but I didn't know what was the name of the CD ... What a pleasure to finally find it ! It's beautiful !!!!!!!!! Especially ""Silhouette"" ... beautiful ! Enjoy, it's very relaxing !"
1,Kenny G. Live -- What Are You Kidding Me????????????,"Pathetic -- You have to be kidding me if you are even reading this review. He is awful, consistenly out of tune, terrible, and basically a self absorbed ""wanna-bee."" You want to buy a Kenny G record, jump onboard with the World's Worst published musician..Give me a break and look fo something real...Please, Kenny Goerelic, better suited, Kenny D., as in DREADFUL. You SUCK!!!!"
2,Kenny G live,Kenny G performs some spirited versions of his songs on this CD. It is one of his better outings.
2,"2 for CD, 5 for Midnight Motion","I am not a fan of Kenny G, but a friend had the CD on and Midnight Motion started playing. The first part of the song was quite typical of this sort of noise, but then the bass had his solo. Oh mama! One of the great bass solos I have heard. I usually listen to Rush, Zeppelin, and Floyd, so I can truely appreciate good playing. That is why I bought the CD (used) just for the solo. This is also why Midnight Motion gets 5 stars, and the CD 2 (1 for posterity, 1 for being live)."
5,I love Him very much!!!,"I have been inspired by his music for so long. I have all of his music. Kenny G keeps me going through the day. He is included in my everyday life. I listen to his music everyday. When I get married one day, I would like for him to play the Wedding Song that he produce."
4,Love Kenny G,Relaxing music you can listen to to escape the hectic drive or world around you. Is worth the purchase price for this prolific artist.
4,10blazin underground tapes ebay seller,"im not gona bore you with tha underground tapes crap but if you a fan this is a must ,,heavy alkapone album some good track on this and resurection check that out also good stuff"
3,religion book,"The book itself is fine, but I'm dissapointed that Amazon had two copies of the fifth edition left the day I purchased the book, and I didn't realize that there would be a newer edition the next week. My class eneded up using the sixth edition."
1,Extreme Disappointment,"This item was listed with The Droll Yankee Flipper as used, which I of course assumed was a used bird feeder. While I realize that the price, even for a used feeder, seemed very low, I was shocked when the shipment notification said it was nothing more than a video. I had previously purchased the The Yankee Flipper and this video came FREE with the feeder. Fool me once, but certainly not again!"
3,Psychology Textbook,"I have a mind interest in psychology, this is not the particular type of textbook I would choose. It is a very informative book, but it doesn't leave a lot of room to explore. Overall it isn't the best or worst textbook I've seen for psychology and to have it as a required text for class shouldn't be too terrible."
5,Great,I appreciate the way that the book was recieved and was just at stated and love that I didnt have to pay full price for the material...Thanks!!!
2,Terrible,"As a student actually looking to gain knowledge from my psychology class, I really, really do not like this textbook. It is was too simplistic and the author frequently writes in first person. Similar to reading a People magazine."
3,LolaM review,the book was fine. The seller claimed that it was brand new but there was study markings and the book looked a bit worn so it wasnt brand new at all. either way i needed the book and am glad to have it.
4,Great price (at the time),"Excellent jersey offered at around 20usd but when I went back for more (possibly a MHL team set), the vendor had apparently come to their senses and put the price way back up. The quality is fantastic and the design speaks for itself in the photo. I guess I was lucky this time."
5,Works great. Smells great.,Good buy. Works great and should fit most shoes size 7 or bigger. Handle at the edge makes it easy to remove
3,Really wide,"The Allen Edmonds shoe trees are really really wide. My feet are a little on the narrow side-not so narrow that I have to find special sizes or anything, but I tend to prefer brands that run narrow-and these are so wide that the large barely fits in my 10.5s, even though there's at least an inch of clear at the toe. I'm considering exchanging them for something with a better shape."
4,Does the job,Does the job. Nice design. Tightens wide wise as well. Maybe a little flimsy for daily use but time will tell. So for very good
5,Best shoe trees I ever had,"This item was just what I was looking for, though I had never used their products.It fits the pair of shoes I wanted it for perfectly.If I need any in future will use this brand"
3,Not bad,They feel a little loose when inserting into a 13d shoe. Like I said not bad but I like the ones I got at Dillards better!
2,heh,The product is fine. Problem is on the website for my size and width it said large. Then on the box of the product it says I should have went medium.
5,Great!,They keep my $150-$300 shoes in great shape. I believe they'll last for 20 years at least! Can't expect to keep your shoes nice if you don't take care of them!
3,It is what it is,"The Mahogany wood can absorb certain odors. The device it self is not the most durable tree, it can lock up easily, but fixing is also simple. I was never sure of Trees for my shoes, I feel like they generally stretch it out and the shoe no longer really fits as beautifully as it use to. If you know a lot about Trees then you know whether or not you should buy this product and reading this review was meaningless...If you don't know much, I'd research a little more before investing in something you don't know much about, even if it's as cheap as 20-30$."
5,Protect your shoes,"These will protect your shoes by maintaining their shape and keeping them dry. The cedar smell is a side benefit.Use the official Allen Edmonds sizing chart, but keep in mind that if you have wide feet like mine, the shoe trees may still not be wide enough. Err slightly on the side of a larger size."
5,Smells great and works great,Got 2 sets for my husband's leather dress shoes. It slid right in and filled out the whole shoe to keep out wrinkles. The best part for me is that his shoes smell like cedar instead of stinky socks! Fits his size 9 shoe perfect. Also arrived when promised.
4,well made,"well made, smells goood--highly recommedn for any show that you paid alot of money for x x x x x"
5,Shoe Maintenance,This product keeps shoes looking and smelling their best. It is produced in the USA. Helps your shoes keep their shape.
4,Good shoe trees,"These are great shoe trees for the price. They have definitely helped keep my shoes in shape. There is one problem though, they will chip a little near the back of the toe as they are put in the shoes time and time again. Its nothing major, but a little annoying."
2,Had to put socks of them,"The edges are not sanded ot beveled, as the toe section expands in the shoe it press an edge against the in side of the shoe causing a crease on the ut side of my 335 dollar Allen Edmond shoe, not cool"
5,Great value!,"The first thing you notice about these shoe trees is that they smell terrific. A blast of cedary goodness hits your nose as soon as you open the amazon box, and it just gets stronger from there. They make my shoes smell good and they look classy, too (and have a nice little brass plate screwed on). Plus, they'll basically pay for themselves in the long run by extending the life of the shoes. Definitely worth the money."
3,I don't understand all the good comments,"It's just ok, but nothing more than the other shoe trees. And mine came a bit broken.Still I use it, it's fine, even though broken, but nothing like ""whoa, this is amazing"""
5,Nice shoe tree,"I got a medium size for my size 9 dress shoes. A little tight, but excellent quality and MADE IN AMERICA."
4,Product is great; tough to size,The product itself is great. I found it tough to understand exactly what size to buy - had to go to the Allen Edmonds web site to get enough assistance. My two cents...
2,Not What I'd Hoped,"I bought two pairs of the Allen Edmonds Ceder Shoe Trees and would not recommend the product.Of the four, one tree was originally stuck in a locked position. This was caused by a flaw in the metal mechanism, a dent in the metal that prevented the shoe tree from expanding. With about 10+ min of effort I finally forced open the toes and identified the dent in the metal as the cause. It sticks up and catches on the wood when fully closed. While its now functional, the shoe tree has limited mobility, and if I were to close it again, it could easily lock up.I would otherwise identify the material as sturdy and the price as fair, however the dent in the metal is hard to ignore. I had previously purchased $20-$25 shoe trees from Nordstroms, these are in many respects equivalent or superior to the Allen Edmonds brand."
2,Did not last long,These fit my size 11 shoes well at first but the spring broke on them the 2nd time I used them. Disappointing as I would have expected better from this brand name.
3,Not for small narrow shoes,"These are a bit wide for small narrow shoes, so they tend to stretch them. A little too movable in the toe area, so positioning them correctly takes time and is critical for correct shape of the shoe. I actually purchased these for my son's high priced cleats. They work, but it takes a little extra effort to position correctly. Great cedar smell!"
4,Best speakers in 20 years.,To be fair also my first speakers in 20 years. Great size as they will fit on a bookshelf with ease. Fantastic sound for such a small package. Works really well with the LC2 Centre but I am about to purchase a sub-woofer as the bottom end lacks just a bit.
3,They Look Nice But Sound is Marginal,"I bought these to use in my small photographic studio with components that used to be my home stereo system. The system has a lot of power and fidelity but these speakers seem to be stuck in midrange with limited highs and muddy lows. And while they are very heavy, the mounting system is only 8-1/2"" wide so they don't naturally attach to studs in the wall. For the money I had expected better fidelity ... maybe I've done something wrong."
1,Bad customer service & bad unit shipped.,I purchased these expensive speakers last year way sooner than I should have. When I recieved them I did not use right away because was doing some remodeling and did not want to hang until finished. When I finally did hook them up they would blow out the speaker circuit for my reciever. I contacted the vendor and never heard back from them. Because this was already a couple weeks beyond the Amazon.com return policy time frame I figured I would deal with this later on so I did and after many hours with tech support for my reciever I came to the conclusion they were to powerful for my older reciever. So I bought a new one recently and the same thing happens. I contacted the seller again and have not recieved a response from them. I guess I now have to deal with this through the warranty from JBL but am very unhappy that I recieved defective goods and no response from the seller. Will not purchase this type of expensive item again through Amazon.com.
4,Larger that expected,"When I received this unit, it was obviously very well built and designed for its purpose, but it was much larger that I had expected. It is large enough for the larger Pro model digital cameras, but too large for my Canon 40D with Telephoto zoom lens. Wearing this bag with the supplied chest harness blocks too much of your forward view and for me presented a trip hazard since I planned to use it while hiking in rugged terrain and while skiing. I exchanged the bag for the LowePro Topload Zoom 2 which is not as deep but still holds my 40D and lens."
3,Size was incorrect!,I love this picture and thought I was going to receive an actual poster. What I got was a print that was slightly larger that a piece if legal paper.
2,"some great features, but HATE the wheels","I like this stroller for its reversible handlebar and the recline feature, but the basket is hard to get to when you use the infant car seat. Also, the wheels are horrible. They don't turn well. They are hard to manage when going over sidewalks that aren't even and it doesn't drive well.I struggled with this decision before having my son and didn't want to spend the money on the Bugaboo frog stoller. If I had to do it over again, I would have spent the money on the frog instead of this stroller. In fact, I will probably sell this one on eBay. So if you want this stroller, check out eBay for a deal."
1,THE WORST STROLLER EVER MADE!!!!,"It was recommended by a friend who had the Pilko, and being a first time mom I had no idea about strollers. I wish I could return it but unfortunately they surprised me with the stroller and threw out the box. No manuverability, gets stuck all the time, baby is not confortable (nor is mom or dad). When I called customer service they said that they were sorry we were not happy and hung up. DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER...YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!"
2,"I HATE this stroller, not worth the money","I looked around for a long time before deciding on a stroller. I chose this stroller because of the reversible handlebar and the bassinet. After using this stroller now for 3 months I am ready to throw it out the window. I can't stand using it. The wheels are horrible. I have to literally push it sideways to get it to go straight. I am going to try and sell it and I am going to buy the Bugaboo Frog. I didn't buy it originally because of the price, but after dealing with this, the Bugaboo Frog will be worth every penny. I have read some other reviews that the 2006 model has better wheels, I hope so, because the 2005 model is HORRIBLE."
5,I love this one I can't wait to get my hands on it,"This video is loaded with highlights about the Bulls' fifth ring. If you don't like this video, you just don't like the Bulls."
3,Another great song to add to the collection,When i first heard this song..i imediatley liked it. chris martin has such an amazing and unique voice. i loved the words in this song and i was so happy that coldplay had come out with another (great) cd. this song has so much meaning that most people can relate to it in some way. A great song and many more great songs on the newest cd as well as the others.
1,Lowest Possible Quality for the Money,"Bought these figuring they would be a good value for timing our local high school swim meets. Didn't want to spend too much since the watches often ""walk"". They are unusable. I returned all 12 of them. Buttons are too hard to click for a stopwatch. Also hard to get into the right mode and keep it there. Timers would be unable to get accurate results. Not necessarily the low price that makes them cheap--just poorly made. I got some new ones that cost only slightly more and they work great!"
3,"if they are good, they are very very good...","I bought several of these for timing work and swim laps; two work very easily and well, and two were crotchety, not turning on and off easily and making me slip on the time. It seems the quality is inconsistent."
2,Oslo Stop Watches,Start and Stop buttons sometimes do not work properly. You have to press really hard to get them to function.
1,Cheap garbage,"You certainly get what you pay for. This product was nothing but frustration and I have just thrown it away. The stop/lap buttons simply do not consistently work correctly, resulting in confusing lapping when you are trying to stop and reset. Hard to explain, but the bottom line is that this product wholly fails in its simple purpose."
2,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this stopwatch a while back. It has been functioning progressively worse over time with unresponsive buttons. I finally gave up on it when I used it for trying to time my wife's contractions during labor, resulting only in a stream of curses when I could not get the thing to stop in about half my attempts. Works intermittently for unimportant things but buy something better if you need it to count."
1,Not reliable,"If you're looking for a stopwatch that works consistently without sticking buttons, don't buy this one. I bought four for our Regional Competition and none of them worked reliably. I wish I could get my money back, as they're all going into the dumpster. All four judges and their assistants tried these stopwatches and they just didn't do the job."
5,A definite READ,"This story is about an Alien conquered earth in which one man searches for his family the aliens kidnapped. This is such an underated novel, it deserves more publicity for being a great book. It has an exciting plot, well developed characters, swift, and a definite page turner. Too bad it's out of print. . ."
3,Latin Praise,"I bought this cd years ago & I loved it, but I lent it to someone who lent it someone who never returned it. If I recall correctly, it's praise with a little salsa. Just what you need to pick you up on those days you wished you'd stayed in bed."
4,Waco's Debt - Book of Contrasts,"Waco's debt is a bit different to the standard Western, and even a bit different from the wonderful JT Edson's normal fare.Generally about the character Waco trying to solve the mystery of his foster parent's murder. Involves travelling to more cultured places, some great comedy and (as always) exciting action.Very enjoyable read that leaves you wanting to know more about the characters."
3,interesting collection of three novellas,"interesting collection of three novellas. the second (""on ice""), which concerns an American girl and her relationship in Germany, is rather silly and pointless, but the first (the title story) and third (""blessed art thou"") were interesting. the third, which concerns a monastery thrown into disarray by unexpected events, took on rather too many things at once but had some good ideas. the first, concerns a woman who marries into an extremely wealthy family, but was rather too simplistic, but it worked well as a character sketch. hopefully the other works by this author are better but retain the mystery and interesting ideas of these three novellas."
2,Obviously there is an audience for this product....,"George A. Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them. Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film.For this viewer the 'parody' eludes. LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark, grotesque, poorly written, hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre. But how fine actors like Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Asia Argento, and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum. Grady Harp, December 06"
3,It's Zombie Time Again!,"This film didn't quite impress me on a grand scale, because the story and the performances were mediocre. I must give credit for the special effects and makeup team, because this film is visually engrossing and gorey consistently, and it goes beyond the level Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later has achieved. Though I find that this film got a bit tiring for me after seeing so many repetitious gun shots at zombies and zombies eating humans. It's not a scary experience, but it's more gruesome. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead more, because I loved Sarah Polley. With this film, John Leguizamo is more outstanding, and Dennis Hopper is rather low-key for a villian. Anyways, if you want to see lots of bloody killing and explosions, then this is going satisfy your craving, and it might even lessen your appetite if you were eating during this film."
4,"Very Good, but Far From a Masterpiece","Is it just me or do zombie movies get tiresome pretty fast? Same thing over and over again, such as, numerous headshots and feasting scenes. I respect George A. Romero and his films, but enough already with zombie flicks. Now as far as these ""Dead"" flicks go I would rank this one right at the top with Dawn of the Dead. I enjoyed the excess gore, the solid acting, and the great zombie makeup. I didn't really have much to complain about other than the fact that all these zombie films seem alike. Worth seeing if your a fan of the genre or want to see how the only person qualified to make a zombie picture still has the stuff when it comes to the genre he created with Night of the Living Dead."
1,Terrible - I got up and walked out of the theater,"Ignore the praise in reviews likely written by marketing people working for the publisher - this movie sucked horribly. I have been a huge horror fan since the 80's' and love zombie movies, but this has got to be one of the worst, and stupidest of all the zombie movies I've seen. Possibly the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I have never walked out of a movie in the theater before, but I walked out on this one. If you absolutely must see it, then rent it, but I don't recommend buying it, because chances are you won't bother finishing it."
2,Disapointing,"GOing into this movie I expected a well done Zombie movie, since it was helmed by the master of all Zombie movies George A. Romero. However, I very disappointed. This film seemed to be more of a way to cash in on his past work. There is no character development in this film. The good guys aren't very sympethicly good, and we don't learn anything new about why or how the zombies are the dead alive. And why they are starting to act like they use to when they were alive."
3,It's okay.,"I forget how much I paid for the movie, but I would say I paid to much. It's a 1.99 movie. Not worth much more."
4,George Romero's Land of the Dead,It was a different spin on the zombie tale. I especially like how the zombie's adapted to being dead and following their leader.
2,Cheesy and Disappointing,"At first glance, being written and directed by George Romero and starring Simon Baker and Denis Hopper, how bad could it be?? The answer is VERY. Most of the one-star reviews will go into it further, but there was just no coherency, it was all so ill-logical and stupidly cartoonish.. What the whole thing amounts to is an excuse to let Tom Savini cheesy gory special effects go wild...I gave it 2 stars only because of the homage to Pittsburgh...the inside joke of being able to distract the zombies with fireworks, just like Pirate fans."
2,Romero is losing it!,"Just when you though it was safe to go back to see a Romero zombie flick...Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the genre, & George Romero is the king of the zombie movies...But this movie was a real let down. The plot was so predictable, & I felt George gave to much ""Life"" to the zombies...Cmon, zombies cant think! Anyway, I bought it because I own just about every zombie movie made, but I don't think I'll be popping it in the DVD player anytome soon."
2,STORYLINE SUCKED,"Now if you like a creepy graveyard, zombie taking over a town and helpless people are trapped and are trying to live, then this movie isn't for you. This zombie movie has a much different storyline. People try to attack zombies, but wait, the zombies are smart and intellegent. They even have a leader. They know how to run,use weapons and understand humans. So they attack a city full of rich people while the army tries to save them.Sorry, but I thought the storyline was way to-out-there for me. I mean, look at Dawn of the Dead. That movie had a good storyline, and it scared the hell out of me. Bottom line, it wasn't scary, the gore was ok and the movie pretty much sucked. So zombie fan, you will be disappointed."
3,"very disappointing, fourth time not the charm","george romero must be getting old. this 4th ""night of the living dead"" movie lacks inspiration. the gore is great, better than ever but the story's poor. none of the characters connects with the viewer and nothing about the movie grabs you (no joke intended) or is new. still, after 3 of the greatest horror films ever made (""night of the living dead"", ""dawn of the dead"", ""day of the dead"") every zombie fan owes it to themselves and george romero to buy and see this movie. george invented the whole zombie thing and he deserves some reward for a lifetimes great work. i just wish this last ""night of the living dead"" movie was better."
1,Land of the Dead (Unrated Director's Cut),"Have not seen in it's entirely because it freeze! I am not a happy customer! I give the person, an F for their were scratchess on the DVD, in which I was caused due to prior ownership! I should have gotten a brand new one!"
1,What The....,"This movie was so bad.I cannot tell you readers anymore but that.It was silly, stupid and a horribly made zombie flick.Very disappointed in Romero who gave us ""Night Of The Living Dead""Why did he do this to us?"
1,C'Mon You People!,"You and I all know this movie was crap! Escape denial and face up to reality. I love Romero's work as much as any other diehard zombie fanatic, but this was poorly thought out and terribly produced.This movie was a huge wadd of spit right into the faces of all of us who were waiting for Romero's final zombie flik."
1,TERRIBLE movie,"This movie flat out sucked! Please do not listen to any of the positive reviews for this movie for I question their intellect. I can't explain how bad the movie is. There is no plot. Terrible, fake looking zombies. The characters are the worst part of the movie. I goota tell you, there must be some actors who are really hard up for money because they went very low for this. Stick to 28 days later, or whatever that zombie movie is that takes place in a mall. If you buy this movie, you will either be very dissapointed or you will like it because you have no sense of what a good movie is."
3,This time it's personal!,"The shuffling, lurching, snail-paced zombies are back, and this time they're showing signs of intelligence - more, in fact, than some of their living counterparts. This outing for Romero's living dead is reasonably entertaining and sometimes amusing. What's missing though is the acerbic humour that there has been in some of the previous movies. This is a straightforward zombie gorefest, and as such is pretty successful. It's worth mentioning Simon Baker, who plays against type and makes a surprisingly good intelligent action hero. Fun but forgettable."
1,I love horror movies more than anyone...,"but this was so dreadfully below average, I had to walk out. The genre is saturated w/ the Dead films, time to move on to something original."
2,What plot?,"Land of the Dead has to be the worst out of all of Romero's ""Dead"" films. There is no plot hardly at all, and a lot of plot holes at that. Why are the zombies after Dennis Hopper? How do they know who he is? Those are just a couple of question out of the movie that are left unanswered. The only reason to watch the movie is to see zombies eat and destroy, but how many movies have we seen that are like that? This movie offers nothing new and is the same old thing that has been done a million times. We have even seen a zombie figure out how to use weapons on Day of the Dead, so zombies using weapons on here was nothing new either. Good special effects and a cameo by Tom Savini are the only thing that this movie worth watching. Everything else is very forgettable and not really worth watching again"
3,This movie kinda sucked.,This movie sucked. It did't have a plot. It felt rushed. The zombies look like crap. Do yourself a favor and watch the dawn of the dead re-make!!!!
2,Not as good as the 1st,Dawn of the Dead is the better title. Thought sequels are supposed to get better.?
1,"Nice paycheck, Romero!","This ""movie,"" and i use the term loosely, seemed like George was phoning one in just for the money. Typical ""i'm really deep, seriously, i promise"" premise of zombies becoming self-aware... that was realistic for maybe 5 minutes, then it was a typical ""run from the bad guys"" flick.Pretty much crap."
3,A LET DOWN FOR ZOMBIE FANS,"This is in my opinion a let down for zombie fan's , the story is weak and so is the acting , the makeup isn't good , not scary at all , so if your expecting this to be as good as Day of the Dead , you might be dissappointed."
3,May it be the last...,"May this be the last zombie movie ever made. ""Land of the Dead"", had a good concept; one that may have been flawly executed at times? So what! The movie was still entertaining; not so much can be said for other titles in this genre.Thanks, George A. Romero! You've influenced countless others. You have made a better film. It's good to go out on top; now bow out gracefully. Maybe, another title, eight to ten years from now? Really, end it!Let 'em, rest in peace.Here's some ideas for those wishing to ""cash in"" on the ""Living Dead"" genre:""Return of the Living Dead 4""""Universe of the Dead"" aka ""Zombies In Space""""I, Zombie""""Politics of the Living Dead"" aka ""Election of the Dead""and (last, but not least) ""Last Zombie Standing"""
4,Good for the Gore,"If you look at this like it will be the next Night of the Living Dead you will be sadly disappointed. However, if you are looking for a great gorey flick with non-stop action, you may have found just what you were looking for. I thought the plot was a little weak but the fake gore was nothing below awesome. I was surprised to see Denis Hopper in this among other familiar faces. Compared to most other zombie flicks, this is an extremely cinamatic film. The filming is great. The special features on the DVD are great. My favorite was the making of the gore. They show you the studios where they put together the fake body parts and stuff. It's all really good gross-out stuff. SO remember, don't watch it with great expectations, just watch it as a modern day horror and you'll like it just fine."
4,Continues the tradition,"Not as trenchant as the original Dawn, but still a very entertaining flick. Romero signals loud and clear that 21st century America doesn't impress him anymore than 1960s or 1970s America did, for the greedy and violent humans create a society that's so sick that you'll cheer when it's eaten alive by the kinder, more humane (though still pretty ugly and hungry) zombies. The satire is over the top, but definitely memorable: I haven't thought once of Fahrenheit 9/11 since I saw it in theaters, and I'd never consider buying it, but I'll watch Dennis Hopper's thinly disguised satire of the Bush administration for years to come."
1,"I haven't seen the director's cut, but the movie I saw left me no reason to ever watch it again","Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to like this, but it didn't even seem like a movie. It just seemed like a couple of good actors came together with a bunch of what seemed to be brand new actors and had someone role a camera while they were practicing their lines.So the movie starts out with these cops driving around in an armored bus with guns and stuff on it. They go around killing zombies. I really don't know what else to say. Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and I wish I could say he was the best part of the movie, but everyone was too horible to say that they helped the movie at all.So if you are looking for a movie that makes no sense, has no character development, but does have some really good gore, then you should check this out.And at the end of this, am I supposed to believe that the head zombie guy just became smart all of a sudden and figured out how to blow stuff up?"
3,Good but unspectacular,"This 4th official entry in the series deals with events surrounding the fictional city area known as Fiddlers green, which is seen as a Utopia by the poorer ""undesirable"" citizens not deemed worthy of protection. The overlord of this area is the ruthless Kaufman (Dennis Hopper) who has a passing ideological resemblance to George W Bush. - ""WE DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS!"" he rants at his board when renegade mercenary cholo threatens to blow his tower up.Overall it's a decent film that doesn't have much in the way of social commentary like the great Dawn of the Dead and as such isn't memorable once the end credits role. The acting is good, but the roles aren't fleshed out enough. The violence is actually quite subdued and mostly takes place in the dark. It's really not a graphic film overall.Worth watching as a distraction but nothing more. The lead zombie needed a meatier role."
1,Did we lose the technology to have movies be in color?,"Have we returned to the days of black and white movie making. However, it seems to be black and blue (Ha! Ha! I unintentionally made a pretty good pun) now. Really, I have been noticing how there are so many movies lately that are only filmed with a combination of blue on top of black. No other colors show through except extreme amounts of red will penetrate the dominating blue color and sometimes even green when they showed a computer screen.This is annoying. I suspect it has something to do with filming in the dark and being too lazy to overcome whatever technicalities it takes to actually create movies set in the dark properly in color.As for the movie, I don't see any progression in this. I should know better but I always watch these stupid movies hoping that they get creative and comedic with the gore. Instead, I am forced to watch living dead after living dead get shot in the head over and over and over and over and..."
1,Oh Come On!!!,"Shame on you Mr. Romero! HORRIBLE! There is nothing redeeming about this film at all. As with last year's dreadful remake/update of ""Dawn Of The Dead"", this bomb features a ridiculous storyline with no characters that you can root for. The only reason you see a star is due to the fact that Amazon doesn't accept reviews without at least one! These truly are dismal days in Hollywood........"
3,Land of the Dead - Mini Review,"The living dead have taken over the world, and the last humans live in a walled city to protect themselves as they come to grips with the situation."
1,Pretty damn bad on a a Zombie Movie scale,"Love Zombie movies and love George Romero's earlier movies but this was horrible. Bad dialogue, terrible story with Zombie's that can think now? Good effects don't make up for the mess that this is.Maybe he should go back to smaller scale zombie movies, he might get his Zombie mojo back."
3,Zombies for all..............,This is not George's best zombie flick. But it's still watchable. Brought the dvd to complete the collection. The one thing I like about George is he could work with great actors. That's is the one thing a horror movie needs respectable acting. Unlike Lucio Fulci who is a loser.
2,The worst of the bunch,"I can't believe that this movie was directed by the same man who did the previous ""Dead"" movies which were so awesome. The first thirty minutes of this were okay but then it just went down from there. Mr. Romero, to save face, please make another attempt at a decent zombie flick. You don't want this last film to be what you're known for!"
2,Land of the Dead.. Indeed,"After hearing everyone talk with such glee about this one , I was looking forward to it. Having enjoyed Night and Dawn , not so much Day ...I was hoping it would be a worthy ending ,if it is.But to be honest I found it to be rather ...bland and boring. Yes there where some pretty cool scenes but Big Daddy drove me nuts . The moment they became ""aware"" it was so lame and laughable it ruined the rest of the movie.As to the acting . It was ok ....with Hopper phoning in a dry stale performance. Plus the ending was absolutely foolish and a laugh out loud .Here is hoping the Dead are indeed done ......for its starting to rot for this horror fan."
4,One of the best Zombie Movies to see,This is one of those movies that brings me back many times to watch it. There is something about this one that makes it good fun to watch. The lineup is nice and is not over the top.Land of the Dead (Unrated Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]
1,I couldn't believe how stupid this was,I hated this so much that I completely forgot about it until stumbling upon this on Amazon. It is retarded on so many levels. I leave it to other reviewers for more details. Just watch it before you buy it.
3,"""Pretty Good Zombie Film!""","Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Asia Argento and Dennis Hopperstar in George Romero's 2005 horror film. A group of peopletry to stop hungry zombies hunting for human flesh. This isa pretty good zombie film and I like the make-up effects.This dvd has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.I recommend this."
3,"Entertaining, not scary","I remember back in the 60's when night of the living dead was released it was the best horror film i've ever seen.Over the years i've seen almost all the major horror films released and To this day it ranks (to me anyway)at number 2.On the other hand Land of the dead entertained my 14 year old daughter and myself but did not scare us like i hoped it would.Being a huge George Romero fan, i expected this movie to be alot scarier than the recent zombie movies released.Unfortuately it wasn't.Still the movie was worth my ticket price.I hope George puts another zombie movie out that defines the word horror.I know he has it in him.Just don't wait 20 years to do it."
4,Not bad,"I'd really rate it at about 3.5 stars, but decided to round up. While not my favorite of the series, the movie kept me entertained. I think it's safe to say that I liked it way better than the remake of Dawn of the Dead. It's at least worth a rent. I bought it new for $6 at a local Best Buy during a sale, and feel that I got my money's worth out of it."
4,Root for the Bad Guys,"George Romero returns to his living dead zombie world. The film opens well after the advent of the Zombies. A section of city bordered by rivers has been walled off from the hungry corpses. But in this haven there is a vast class distinction with the upper crust living in the towering Fiddler's Green while the rest are in squalor. [...] With the survival of the living hanging in the balance and power slipping into the wrong hands the story really works.If you have enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, you will probably like this one. The gore factor is high but not as blatant as in some movies of this ilk. It is an odd movie because you find yourself wanting the thinking zombie to continue to solve problems. I don't know if it is because it means that death and zombiedom might not be final or what, but it is a strange feeling. Good acting by the cast also helps the movie succeed. All in all I had a fun time watching it and was surprised at how good it was."
5,He's back !,"You know it really feels good to have Romero back doing this film, I don't understand why some people even write reviews when they dont even know what there talking about, Without Ramero's Orginal Three Zombie Movies You would never of had the Resident Evil Games or movies, Check out some Interviews of the Resident Evil Game Series over the Years, So even If you Dont Like Land Of The Dead, Or George A.Ramero Give him The Credit due for Anything Zombie, ""Night Of The Living Dead"" Started it, and i am so glad that George got to do ""LAND"" There's already a hint of a Fifth installment coming????? Only one Dissapointment for me, It wasn't long Enough, Why cant they do the Stephen King Five hour Movie for George, Then he could really Get his point across(Just Kidding)...Thank you George, It was worth the wait, The DVD Special Edition Is what i now wait for!"
4,"Could be Better, But it Definitely Works","All in all, I expected more from Romero. . . then again, all in all it was a heckuva movie as well. I would hate to give spoilers to the plot, so here goes. . . As movies have been going since the Millenium, this matches up to the top movies of any other genre. It pushed the zombie genre forward by a leap, had plenty of comedy relief, and of course, the obligatory zombie gore and gross out scenes. The only problems, in my opinion, were a couple of the actors and the fact that there were too many survivors. I would definitely recommend it to any Zombie fans out there, or anyone who has a morbid curiosity with the darker sides of the human psyche."
1,Romero the HIPPIE Zombie !,I thought hippies were dead ! This movie actually does belong in the academy awards of worse movies ever! Romero and his hippie zombie fans need to be sent to iraq and bring our troops back.
2,Mindless Fun,"I think George Romero should have left the humanity out of the movie because this is a zombie movie. and people who watch zombie movies don't want to think, they just want horror and gore wrapped around a little story.As for Zombinator bashing someone for their online review.The person is not trying to ""play a film critic"" he is just giving an honest review of this movie.Why are you so pro-zombie?Your on the zombie side and your not even dead yet.I'm sorry, but you'll have to die & decay first. That's the rules."
1,I love all of Romero's Dead movies but this one...,"Not much need be said about this ""movie"" if we can even call it that.... Utterly horrible in every way.... Tedious non-existant plot with just stuff on screen... If you want a good zombie movie watch the first three he did... This isn't even deserving of the name of a ""Dead"" movie.Resident Evil28 Days LaterDawn of the Dead (the remake) are all infinitely better films on all levels... Avoid this one like the plague!"
2,Kinda lame,"Cheezey 80's style film, that is definately the worst of the 4 films. Too obvious with the political strokes and too simple. Not as smart, shocking, interesting as the other films. Quite a disappointing."
5,George is back!,"There was so much hype in the horror crowd that surrounded this movie, and I was hoping that it lived up to the hype. It surely did! From the first few frames up until the ending, this movie was non stop. Romero created a very good story and a nice group of characters to populate this film. There is so much more technology available now adays and George used this to his advantage. The zombies are not as memorable as in the other three films, but the sheer number of them is mind boggling. I was very happy with the pace of the film too. It moved quick and did not slow down once. The ending is left wide open for a sequel and I hope George give us one. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! vinvega77@yahoo.com Go to the zombie army website too!"
2,I'm Zombified,"I'll never understand how a zombie's body can function, it's dead. OH well.... People were easily torn apart in this movie, I don't know how you can rip someone's arm off just by pulling on it a little bit or put your fingers through someone's stomach, but ok. This movie was very dumb, but with a group of friends it is fun to see the bad make up and death scenes. Not enough action, since that is all that really matters cuz zombie movie plots are pretty dumb."
3,Couldv'e been better,"Ok I have to admit I was disappointed I expected a great movie from George A. Romero but it didn't happen.The gore was the best I have ever seen I give props on that however, as surprise factor and story line goes it sucked.I think George focused too much on gore than the story.I mean it takes place after the zombies pop up and kill people I like to see the lives of people before the zombies attacked.I was so anxious to get this movie but am dissapointed on how it turned out.I love George A. Romero it is just he should have made it better.I think Dawn of the dead the remake surpassed this one unfortunately.I hope there will be better ones in the future.If you love gore than this is for you but if you like sotryline then Dawn of the dead is better."
4,GORE!!,"Alot of people didn't like this movie, but I loved it. I'm glad it wasn't like the other living dead movies. Too much of the same gets old. I agree with the reviewer A.D. Castro with pretty much his/her whole review. I just love the violence and gore in this movie and it's action from start to finish. It never gets boring and oh yeah the gore is good. I just can't get enough blood and guts."
3,It was a fun movie-going experience,"After seeing this I was a little surprised that it got all of these raving reviews from critics. I don't see all of the fuss. But the movie did entertain me and my mom...This is a movie where you don't go and analyze it and say, ""Oh now how did that happen?"" You just go and enjoy yourself. The film really is quite funny seeing the zombies try to adapt to our way of life. From the first scene when they are trying to play instruments to when they figure out how to use guns..it really is amusing and enjoyable.If you hate blood and gore..please avoid at all costs. This flick is packed with images you wouldn't believe if you saw it. But if you love zombies and mass mayhems of gore and destruction, check it out and have a good time!"
3,Meh..could have been better,"Mediocre movie.. This movie seemed to be more like the remake of 'dawn of the dead' and a lot less like 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'Day of the Dead'. Too much plot, not enough sheer zombie killing. Also, they seemed to make this movie a bit humerous. I'm not sure if that detracted from the overall theme of the movie though.I suggest you watch it..but wait for it on DVD or cable"
2,Mad Max imitation with zombies,"This is an unnecessary movie really. It beats me why Romero felt like making another zombiemovie after I watched it. The story line of the dead picking up some human tricks like shooting guns looks very silly. I think last year's remake of Dawn of the dead should have been a nice conclusion of the zombiemovies for the next 10 years. This movie isn't even scary anymore...it is like watching an action movie with zombies. Was this Romero's attempt to show everyone he still can make a better zombiemovie then any other director? If so, he shouldn't have bothered. (SARR)"
1,TERRIBLE FLICK.,"Being a huge zombie-movie fan, a huge George Romero fan, and into horror movies in general I have to say this is probably one of the worst zombie movies ever. It is painful as heck to sit through. The acting is mostly over the top, the story needs refinement, and I don't care about any of the characters."
3,Honest Review.,"Out of Romero's zombie films, this one is probably the worst. However, it doesn't mean it was a bad movie. (especially during this time period) The gore was decent, however there was way too much CGI in this movie. You see something happen and you know it was done with computers and it sorta takes you away from the movie for a few seconds, which prevents you from being really ""into"" the movie. During the commentary it seems they tried to downplay the use of CGI. However, it seems like most everything you see is done with CGI. It would have been a lot better if they used live/on-set effects like all of the previous movies.I did like the social message behind it all (as all his movies do), but I'll let you interpret it for yourself.The acting was okay at best, but you don't really look for acting in a zombie film. heh."
1,dead really was dead,"after seeing this movie, i have only one question..who made this piece of crap anyway the disney channel????the movie KING OF THE ZOMBIES W/MANTAN MORELAND WAS scarierTHAN THIS s#!t...."
3,"Romero's Best - But not Best Zombie movie ever made, either!","Even though this movie had its strong points, and also Romero's best zombie movie due to its updated special effects - it is still not the greatest zombie movie of all time.Hands down, that belongs to either the newly-remade Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later. Those two movies went full out. This one didn't."
2,Very disappointing,"I am a big fan of Romero - but this film was just plain silly. George clearly doesn't appear to have anything new to say. The plot was very weak, and every character was the worst stereotype imaginable.To make it worse even the action scenes were disappointing, as was make-up/sfx. Oh yes - the zombie with the machine gun was laughable. One not to buy."
2,bad plot and poor climax ending,This movie compares to Dawn of the Dead (2004). It's a stylized and a Hollywoodized movie. The cast in this movie were perfectly cast (just like Dawn remake) but the plot was very lame. The ending was very lame. There was no climatic ending. And of course the cast weren't killed off one by one like in a typical horror movie. The movie was just like Resident Evil Apocalyse without the action. Just a bunch of zombies getting shot here and there. The truck (dead reckoning) wasn't used to kill zombies in the movie like in the Dawn remake. What a lame zombie movie. And this comes from a zombie horror fanatic like me.
3,Alright I Suppose,"I will start off by saying that this was not one of Romero's best zombie flicks. It seems a little rushed, though in spirit I am sure there was a great deal that Romero wanted to put into the film even with the director's cut, but there was no real sense of zombie menace like in the previous films. The film seemed more directed towards the drama of the human characters. And intelligent zombies? C'mon now. Skip this and watch any of Romero's previous films or watch Shaun of the Dead instead!"
2,Romero,"Well the long awaited new installment in George Romero's famous ""Dead"" trilogy is finally here! They tried to update it and I think it fails in many respects. While Dawn of the dead is one of the best horror films ever made and Night of the Living Dead way ahead of its time, here it just seems laughable because it is not scary. It not only compares poorly to other films in the series, but it appears Romero is washed up. If they polled people on what scared them in the year 2010, I bet that ""zombies"" wouldn't be near the top of what scares people. But the wait finally is here, but what a disappointment. Shaun of the Dead was a much better zombie film in many respects. Romero fails to tred any new ground as a director. While zombies were pretty much an American thing, the Italians took to new levels (see Lucdio Fulci, et al). That cycle pretty much ended with Cemetary Man."
4,not his best but...,"just wondering why people are recommending dawn of the dead remake version ?? ummm obviously the original is better - it was the original!!! any remake is uninspiring and unoriginal. let's also not forget that romero invented the modern zombie genre- period. this is not his best work, its nothing new at this point, but really now - he was before Fulci's zombi, and wayyyyyyyyyyy before 28 days later. you kids out there need to take a friggin history lesson and try to appreciate the old school films."
3,Smart Zombies?,"making zombies a little more intelligent is not a good idea its not scary or cool or even funny. but the movie and it's plot is pretty good besides that.Im looking forward to Dawn of the Dead 2, supposedly their making a sequel to the dawn of the dead remake. fast zombies are funny and cool.but, if Romero would have made the zombies slow i think it might have bben better.zombies are suppose to be dumb. but still a good movie."
2,Hanna- Barbara Cartoons presents?,Poor old George. I suppose that tank riding into town machine gunning its inhabitants and then leaving was meant to represent Iraq. But its Capitalism that's demeaning him if he's making twaddle about Zombies for the masses at his ripe old age. He's a silly man.
2,"B. Lynch, you see every movie as a Bush bash","Check out this guys other reviews.Almost every one is an allegory to Bushs failures, as he sees them.That makes all his reviews null and void.The election is over, get over it."
2,real disappointment,"I couldn't wait to see George Romero's latest release, but this one was a real disappointment. Either I have seen too many Zombie movies or I grew out of it watching that kind of stuff. There were actually no innovations, just the old stuff warmed up over and over again. If you have seen Romero's ""Living Dead Trilogy"", this movie is simply boring. Actually the remake of ""Dawn of the dead"", which is not a Romero movie, is a real gem compared to Land of the Dead. I'm really surprised about the hype that's going on about this flick. To me it was only boring and I was glad leaving the movie theatre."
4,It's Gory but Good,"The world is taken over by zombies but a greedy rich man has a secure building that he pays soldiers to protect while his rich friend and he live the good life. When one of the soldiers asks to move into the building and is turned down he steals an armed truck that is a powerful weapon and threats to blow up the building unless the greedy rich guy gives him five million dollars. Meanwhile, the zombies are getting smarter and threaten to take over the protected city. The basic subplot is the inherit evil in class systems and looking down on others because you think you are better.Good zombie flick but you better not be grossed out by gore if you want to watch it. I liked it."
2,Honestly not that great...,"I came into this film with high expectations, and I was really disappointed overall.. The acting was good and the premise of the plot, I thought, was very interesting (a view of zombies after 40 years and the ways humans have succeeded or failed in keeping them at bay). The problem was all in the way the zombies were portrayed.. they just weren't scary.. at all. The idea that zombies would evolve is kind of far-fetched anyway (when do they have time to evolve when they're constantly decaying..) The zombies were very slow moving but not in an aggressive or menacing way. They almost seemed too human and that took away from a lot of the terror of the film.Overall, I'd recommend checking out one of the better Zombie films if you're in the mood for a good scare (Night of the Living Dead or even the hilarious Shaun of the Dead would both be better bets)."
2,Maybe I was too excited...,"Let me tell you a little bit about creatures called zombies. They're dead humans reanimated, they only think about eating brains and human flesh, and when they're not thinking about that.... well... they're never NOT thinking about that. That's what makes zombies so great. They're mindless shuffling relentless flesh eating machines. So when they start communicating in grunts and primitive gestures and formulating a plot to take over one of the last human cities you kinda throw the whole allure of the zombie out the window. Now you have a movie about a group of stupid cannibles attacking a town. Or basically vampires (zombie's undead cousins) without fancy abilities. The acting sucks, surprisingly, even though the cast consisted of quality actors. It sounded like a good idea in theory but it ended up falling WAY short."
3,Not exactly a return to form,"I never saw Night of the Living Dead in it's cinema release days - far too young! - but it's a really cool movie, especially the twist at the end. `Dawn' wasn't up to the same standard, but it was still a decent flick. `Day' was the best of the bunch overall - such a cool movie, combining good horror and action. So, I came to this with high hopes. Oh well... This is the weakest of the four. Not only is the plot cliché and already well-used, but other than some really spectacular special effects employed to kill the zombies, it brings nothing new to the genre at all. As horror/action goes, the remake of Dawn is by far superior to this. Yep, Romero's really dropped the ball with this one. He originally set the standard, but now is barely keeping up with his contemporaries, with this effort actually seeing him lagging behind. It's a pity the franchise had to end on such a downer."
3,disappointed,"All i have to say is George Romero sold out. This movie didn't even have the feel and style of a Romero movie. You could tell Universal had their mitts all over it. As a zombie movie it was fine, which is why i gave it 3 stars...as a Romero zombie movie it was 1."
1,What went wrong???,"Before I get into Romero's ""Land of the Dead"" let me mention a few things.When I first heard about the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake directed by Zack Snyder, I was the first one to put it down. I said ""how can anyone remake a classic like that?!? I ended up loving it!! I was ""Dead"" wrong about not giving it a chance. Now don't get me wrong, it isn't better than the original, but in it's own right....it was awesome.Fast Forward to ""Land of the Dead,"" my most anticipated movie since ""Day of the Dead"" came out in 1985. I thought this would be the ultimate zombie movie. Once again I was ""Dead"" wrong!! This movie sucked!! There were no dynamics, terrible characters, and the whole evolution thing didn't work. There was a zombie leader for crying out loud!! Just silly. I could go on and on, but it will be pointless.Say I'm crying out to Zack Snyder. Please make more zombie movies!!How Ironic."
4,"EVERYTHING I HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE, EXCEPT...","It just feels rushed!! 93 minutes is not long enough for a Romero masterpiece! I eagerly await the 140+ minute directors cut that I am sure is in the works. That said... this is one heluva zombie flick and stacks up well with the others in the series. Superior acting (hopper is great), extensive gore(old school style!!YES), campy script, sweet FX, what more can you ask for? I can see some NOTLD hardliners being a bit disappointed at the ending or, perhaps, the overall tone of the film(zombies with souls?), BUT...folks this is one mean, bloody, smart, proud zombie movie!! Its finger-lickin good!! 4.5 stars!"
4,Great Zombie movie,"What I really liked at this movie, is that the Zombies are noz as dumb as usual. They getting smart as more as the movie is running.Pretty cool and nice action!"
4,Well-done gorefest,"Simon Baker is sexy, and hard to tear ones eyes away from. The direction and effects were great in this movie. The story was even pretty good. John Leguzaimo (sp?) got on my nerves. The heroine was well cast. There was plenty of gore for those who enjoy it. I loved Tom Savini's cameo (see if you can spot him!). Entertaining, thrilling. Not very scary but suspenseful at times. Well done...recommended for fans."
5,One of the greatest zombie flicks of all time!,"I loved this movie.It was a fast paced movie with excellent effects and unique death sequences.I really liked the story,characters and of course the gore.I think Romero hit a home run with this one.The Zombies move slow like always(except dawn of the dead remake)but they are smarter now and can find more ways to kill people.Buy this movie now!"
3,self aware but entertaining,"Romero's Dead films have always focused on primordial fear of contagion, a theme rampant in horror films. Below this is a deft social commentary [America's suppressed awareness of the Viet Nam War; worship of consumerism] or a heavy handed one as in his latest effort.There is a society divided into the have and the have nots. The haves live in blissful ignorance of the have nots and their struggles, which is mostly of the zombie variety. This is a little too on the nose to be subtext, and Romero seems self aware of what he is 'supposed' to be saying in his films.The highlights are the evolution of the zombie concept [here they can learn and retain reflexive behavior from their past life], and Dennis Hopper's wicked performance as CEO of the new Corporate America."
1,It Blows Chunks!!!,"It was slow, stupid, and a waste of time.. Only by this movie if you need a quick two hour nap!! The thing that made it stupid was the ""SKYFLOWERS"". Atleast in the other zombie movies they couldn't be stopped by fireworks unless you shoot them with fireworks!!!"
4,"Great series, poor ending. Worth buying though.","Poor ending, though the series was excellent... I'd say that it would be normal to be disappointed by the ending. The entire story build up to that very point and it wasn't as earth shaking as the authors would have you guess. However I did think the adventure there was actually worth the price of getting the entire series!"
3,A Decent End to the Sovereign Stone trilogy....,"I am a huge fan of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. But this Soveriegn Stone Trilogy has been at best a so-so fantasy story. Book 1 was more of a prequel, Book 2 seemed to get lost in itself, and Book 3 finally puts it all to rest. This is not their best work. But it did remain interesting throughout. The ending is a bit of a letdown and it seems that any chance of some intense action is dispelled quickly. I would not really recommend this trilogy to a friend when there are simply better fantasy stories to focus on out there. So only read if you read the first two. Then put it on the shelf to gather some dust."
3,"Great story, lame ending","The set of books was pretty powerful stuff, with great character development, awesome sub-plots, and lots of action....up until the end.What happened guys? The other books they have written always leave something open for a future novel, but still end grteat and basically give closure. In this one, about 1500 pages worth of story (3 books worth), ended in about 2 pages. Blink and you miss it. I sure hope they pick it up in their next series, because this one left me wanting a lot more.By the way,will the authors please finish the Starshield Sentinels series! You can make up for a lot by completing that one."
4,Joe Turner the pianist,"Joe Turner (1907 - 1990) was a fine stride pianist, constantly confused with Joe Turner the blues singer. This CD, recorded in 1979 in Bern, Switzerland, provides a good record of Turner the all-round entertainer. Just three tracks, ""Echoes of Spring"", ""Carolina Shout"" and Turner's original, ""Michelle"" are solo: the remaining tracks feature Turner's vocal talents. He had an attractive voice, varies the pace effectively, and accompanies himself skilfully. Recording quality is good - the piano is a little tinny, but no worse than many of the instruments that jazz pianists have to put up with.Not as essential as the hard to find ""An Evening With Joe Turner"" CD on the Downtown label, this is an enjoyable disc that stride lovers will want to have."
4,Soulful sounds,"On this album, Cape Verde's greatest export to the world delivers another exquisite collection of mournful and yearning songs in her moving, bluesy voice. She sings in creolised Portuguese and the style (morna) is a mix of the Portuguese fado and African rhythms.Although Cape Verde lies just off the West African coast, this style has little in common with the mainland sounds from countries like Senegal or Mali. The instrumental mix includes guitars, the special rhythm guitar called cavaquino and even a clarinet to create an engaging polyrhythmic backing for Cesaria's graceful vocal style. Strangely, the sad songs have an uplifting effect on the spirit.Of the slower songs, my favourites are Ess Pais and Zebra, whilst the funkiest uptempo numbers are Quem Bo and Mae Velha. The track Pe Di Boi includes a lovely whistling interlude. The foot tapping dance track Sangue de Beirona is equally inspiring. This is an excellent album by one of the greatest artists in World Music today."
2,Waste of money,"Buyer beware, these tights might fit an extremely tall and thin cucumber, but not a human being.I'm a plus size - but not all that plus - I ordered size 4 because my body, in addition to being overweight and tall, is quite mature and as other mature consumers know, we need to shop for bigger sizes. These tights are a waste of $."
2,Mediocre at best,Not a whole lot of support. Wish it had a tad more lycra. They get a bit saggy by the afternoon. I don't recommend.
5,Great source for Cables,"The cables were just as pictured - high quality, sturdy, and exactly what I needed. The vendor shipped quickly and the price was outstanding. I recommend them highly and will use them for my cabling needs in the future."
4,For Normal User Is Great,"This CPU Fan is great for normal user, but for high performance you need something better. I have a P4 3.0Ghz and if i playing up over the 56C or 60C. But if use the PC without high resolution or high graphics and high performance the processor have 33C or 42C."
5,14 years and still going strong,"My Dad gave me the first Seiko Titanium watch back in 1997 during my HS graduation, and it is still working up until now 14 years later 2011, never been broken...."
1,Do not Buy this Book,"This book has a horrible printing issue which makes it very very hard to read. Most pages you cannot make out what the words are. So if you buy this book, Do NOT EXPECT MUCH for your money."
1,Do NOT get the Kindle edition,The Kindle edition of the book is missing or misrepresenting math symbols in so many places it makes it completely unreadable.
4,Fantastic exploration into mathematics,"We used it for an undergraduate statistics seminar series; and that was largely a success. PFTB contains many of the most elegant proofs I have ever seen. Reading through it is, by itself, an enjoyable journey through some aspects of many branches of mathematics. A few of its chapters may not address the average undergraduate math population quite well, due to its depth of reasoning and assumption of prior knowledge in Abstract Algebra and Geometry; but those who reads it are likely to be more advanced anyway. In general, an excellent book."
4,Interesting book with a history of journalism,"I bought this on recommendation of someone to help sharpen my writing. It's an interesting older book, with a history of journalism (a must-read chapter, the evolution of journalism was fascinating), some tips for fieldwork, and tips on writing. Being out-of-print and available for very little, I'd recommend it if you want a brief history of journalism and/or a book to help you write a lot in a little space."
3,Register and you wont have that problem,The other reviews state that you can only access the software five times.... that is only true if you do not register your software.
2,"DVD game too repetitive, too few activites for price","The DVD version of Candyland is significantly more expensive than the traditional board game, and it is not worth the money. While my children (5 and 3 1/2) do enjoying playing the game they are frustrated that the games are the same everytime. There are three games to play on the dvd, but they are not random in nature. The ""gumballs"", moves, and character narrative are identical every time you play. After only two days of play my children could tell you what was coming next in each game. I purchased this game because my son has difficulty sitting still for a board game, but loves games requiring physical interaction. I wanted a game that would utilize directions for him to follow and this game does do that, however I could have gotten the same result by playing ""simon says"" with him myself and saved the $30."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","The idea behind The Candyland DVD is great. However, a moron designed it. Your children cannot do this game alone and will get bored halfway through. A parent or older child has to press the 'enter' key on the remote every 90 seconds or so. So you can't even run to the bathroom, take a phone call, or get dinner started while your kids are playing the game.There are also lots of annoying segments throughout the game that have nothing to do with the game. For instance, ""Lord Licorice"" makes an appearance occasionally to bother the host, but my kids just stand there staring at him wondering when they can play again.If you are looking for an activity your kids can do by themselves or with minimal parental involvement, this is not the game to buy! Or if your kids are used to more high-energy, fast action games, this is not for them!"
4,Candy Land DVD Game,I got this for my daughters 7th birthday. Both of my kids (7 & 4) have had a blast playing the various games on the dvd.
4,Fun kid's game,I bought this for the grandkids at Easter and I understand they like it a lot. They are 4 and 6 years old.
1,skip this one.,"my kids actually enjoy playing this game but I find it so annoying I encourage them to do something else. you have to use the remote far too often, and our DVD player is situated above the TV so the kids holding the remote doesn't work. If you want a game like this, try Hullaballoo, by Cranium. Same idea and so much more fun."
4,Fun and we COULD skip the commercials,"We have this game and were able to skip the commercials at the beginning by pushing the enter button on the remote. During hte game we showed our two-year-old which button to push when the picture of the remote came up, and she had fun doing that part too. We really loved it, and it's great for her age range. It also depends on which game you choose of the 3 on the DVD."
1,More a commercial than a game,"The underlying games could be fun, but the pacing and DVD controls are terrible. You're forced to wait for 5 min of commercials at the start and you can't fast-forward (FF) or skip them. In the games, the characters talk too long and you can't FF there as well. An adult has to sit there to press the right remote key every two minutes. My kids, 2 and 4, liked the game at first but got bored in 10 min because the pacing is so bad. Very disappointing, especially for the high price."
1,"not for tile or dogs,cats or small children",this game looks like fun but I don't want 10 four year olds in my living room bouncing around like there's no tomorrow around my furniture.
2,A WHITEWASH!,"I bought this book hoping to get some additional insight into one of the finest musical groups to come out of American pop. Instead this is a book that avoids any of the tough issues of the development and life of this band, and seems to have been constructed of Motown press releases. In fact, this seems like a book that was commissioned by Motown itself. It's a pretty rosy and peachy picture that seems to avoid any of the drama and heartbreak over the ouster of Florence Ballard from the group in 1967, or the events that led to it, or the additional tensions from which now well-known stories have come. Get it right from the horse's mouth and take a look at Mary Wilson's DREAMGIRL AND SUPREME FAITH, for a much more accurate and heart-rending portrayal."
3,Depressing,"I love Robert Girardi's work. The man may be the best writer on the planet. However, these stories do not pose especially poignant ""moral"" dilemmas, nor do they actively engage the reader. I get the sneaking suspicion that Girardi was contractually obligated to provide a book to his publishers and sent them these story ideas instead. I know that Mr. Girardi has read Poe before, but he could learn a thing or two in the short story department about focused action and clear, convincing endings. So the moral of this review is that Mr. Girardi should stick to what he does exceptionally well....write novels."
1,Sloppy and disappointing,"This collection is a terrible disappointment, for at least two reasons. First, and less important, is Girardi's sloppy writing. He commits elementary errors -- like referring to a safe deposit box as a ""safety deposit box"" -- leaving the text littered with annoying little mistakes that any careful writer or observant editor would have eradicated. Second, and far more important, is a failure of authorial will that permits Girardi to invent wonderful, nuanced characters to whom nothing illuminating happens. The voiceless German diver, for example, whose handicap is neither a metaphor for anything nor a plot device. It's just there. Like these stories."
4,Good dark writing about moral decisions,"Aren't we all fascinated by seeing another person's moral compass at work? Girardi's short stories show the twists of fate and choice that move us all forward in life. Good scene setting, too, particularly for our visual age. An easy read that keeps one thinking."
3,ultimately empty,"I bought this book because I loved his previous book, Vaporetto 13. But there is no similarity I think. These stories, all quite different from one another, start off with easily conceived situations but they end with disturbing and disappointing conclusions. They are strange, to be sure, but I did not find them to be a pleasureable reading experience."
2,Questionnable book,"This book, conveniently adding the word ""Internet"" to a title of a previous book has some hideous mistakes in it. First, the site DRKoop.com is represented as JRKoop.com - how can the authors and editors miss that? Plus, the site FogDog.com is another - listed as FrogDog.com. For a book to boldly label itself as an Internet survival guide of sorts, you'd hope they could demonstrate some better knowledge of the net.This book also makes some pretty bold statements that would be better placed on a discussion forum somewhere - they are sure to be questionned and disputed. If you are looking for a good branding book, read Al Rie's book from 1980 - Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind."
2,1 Immutable Law Only,"While the title promises 11 immutable laws, there was in reality only one law. The other 10 laws were simple mutations of that one law. If you are in a rush, you need only read the first part of the book. You would not have missed much.The authors are obviously trying to cash in on their brand name ""The ? Immutable Laws Of ..."". When Al Ries and Jack Trout first wrote the book ""The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing"", I thought that the book was very well written. I bought this book thinking that it would be the name. Alas, it is not to be so.Still, the authors have explained the difference between a good Internet brand versus a bad one. The Internet is an Interactive Medium. As such, the marketer must realise the interactivity of the medium and how it affects branding. The lessons learnt have been quite interesting. However, I still felt cheated as I felt that I have paid for 11 laws but I have only learnt one."
4,Poor book with fine content,"Al Ries is, undoubtly, one of the best marketeers alive. However, I think he wrote this book trying to make a ""first move"" in e-business lectures. To me, this book by itself is not completely good, it seems to have been writen in a rush. Besides, it looks like a copy of the ""22 Inmutable Laws of Marketing"". Anyway, it is still a great book for those who are just starting their own business and those who have been running it for a while but still have a long way to go. It is a little boring after 3 or 4 chapters, but you'll find valuable information that guides you in developing an strategy for your own brand in the WWW (you can use it off-line, too). If you can combine it with Ries' ""22 Inmutable Laws of Marketing"" (""Positioning"" will also help), then you can get a better picture. I rated it 4 stars because of the quality of the content. It is also a good book for students in the first grades of college."
2,expected a lot more,"Unlike the masterful ""22 immutable laws"" this work is piecemeal and IMO somewhat contrived. It is by no means a must-read or necessary volume and moreover if you need a lesson in internet-related markets and marketing, there are much much better works. There are also worse books, hence 2 stars."
4,excellent executive survey,"If you want to understand who will be (are) the winers and losers at he ""i've got the best e-brand"" game. This book will definitely prove an invaluable support.Ries & Ries analyse and describe superbly ""do's & don't's"" in e-branding. Most of the material is fresh, relevant and superbly described. Rule 1 ""business Vs media"" is key for so caled ""click and mortar"" and can prevent many mistakes (even simple observation will tell you many occured already).The book read fast (I did it in less than a week in the subway) and is well written.One pitfall : the authors arguments are mostly ""anecdotals"" rather the fact based. It is OK, for most part, but sometime, the anecdot is a poor justfication.The book will nevertheless prove an invaluable ressource for hurry executive (any e-executive)"
2,Follow law eight... Just do it,Following law eight by skipping this book and just creating a product. I felt this book was more a waste of time than anything. I wouldn't consider myself business savvy but just about everything in this book seemed like common sense to me. I suppose some of the information is somewhat good such as rules for naming a company (why I gave it two stars). I felt like most of what was said could have been distilled into 20 or so pages. Many of the examples consists of bullet lists which seem like just filler and which are repeated time and time again throughout the book.
1,Painful,"Not only is this book contradictory, inaccurate, and outdated, it is horribly written and edited. The authors make numerous unfounded statements regarding Internet companies and frequently misspell their names, forcing the reader to ask how well the authors understand the Internet. Anyone with minimal Internet experience could have written better ""rules"" than Ries & Ries."
2,talk about a THIN book,"this book was a fast read, and that's not always a good sign. The author attempts to make sweeping statements like: Internet advertising will never work...and simply assert them. Give a few examples of how this is true. Ignore any studies (there have been about six major ones this year) that lay out the REAL case for/against. That's just the start. The point is that major points are proven in mere paragraphs (or so the author thinks). If you work in a brand department or are considering starting your first Internet business (ever)...this book won't be pedestrian. If you've ever read a legitimate work in this field like The Brand Mindset or anything by HBS...avoid this one, you won't finish it ..."
2,is it immutable?,"Through the whole process of reading this book, I just wondered that '11 immutable laws of internet branding' are truly based on thorough research of Internet marketing by authors. Their immutables cannot be immutables at this point, and moreover, their context are just reiteration of their last book, '22 immutable laws of marketing', with slight change of several themes based on Internet commerce. Also, I found writers' expertise are really too meager to write a book about e-commerce. Totally, this book is based on half-baked research with authors' soft-touch on e-commerce."
2,Very Disappointed,"I had high expectations for this book given the reputation of Al Ries. However, I found the book to be rather disappointing. Ries and Ries make some interesting points in the book, but I found several topics being repeated throughout the book (which is short as it is). They seem to adopt a very simplistic approach to branding success- use a proper name and you're halfway there! Success online is much more complicated than brand name selection, but the authors seem to suggest otherwise. I became skeptical of the authors' assertions after noticing a huge blunder in Chapter 4, where the authors identify former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop as ""J.R. Koop"" and the website bearing his name as ""jrkoop.com."" Yes, we could blame the editor for this error, but ultimately the reflection is on the authors. It seems that Ries and Ries violated one of their own ""laws"" by extending the ""Immutable Laws"" product to the internet. As written, it just does not work!"
2,The Ries' have bought in to the Internet hype,"A decent book, that is a quick read. The Ries' provided a couple of good examples that I can apply. BUT - it is clear they have bought in to the Internet hype TOO much - for example - they predict that Wingspan will be the winner in the online banking wars...however, the day before I read this book, I read the Industry Standard May 15 edition, with an article about Wingspan where they say BankOne.com customers outnumber Wingspan by almost 5:1. (BankOne is the parent co. of Wingspan)Things like this, and terrible editing, such as repeatedly calling Dr.Koop.com ""J.R. Koop"" made me take much of what was said in this book with a grain of salt."
2,Disappointing,Book starts well and then goes downhill after the 1st half into a very pro-American where everything American is GREAT! Which as a non-American is grating.Also it is very good at pointing to companies who have made mistakes or were too slow to get into the internet however it provides no advise as to how they can get back their lead - which quite frankly would have made the book more interesting.One other minor point - Burger King the great American institution mentioned many times as being American is owned by Diageo an English Food & Drink Conglomerate.
4,Worth Reading for those in this field,This book by Al Ries and Laura Ries is Good overall and is in lines with their previous works with similar titles. The author's style of writing itself is impressive with so many examples to prove the point or at least to convince the reader. Although at times I felt that the examples of extranet brands are more than internet brands and even wanted to know the sources of the Data the authors have quoted in various examples. An appendix of the same would have helped to make the book more credible and convincing! But definitely it is worth reading for all those in the field of Internet Marketing and Brands for it gives some invaluable tips.
2,A book for the branding novice...,"I found this book to be very simplistic overall and lacking truly indepth examples. In my opinion, the entire contents of this book could be covered in a well defined chapter or two. Its easy reading and may be educational for the branding novice. However, if you're an experienced branding professional, look for another alternative."
1,175 Pages? How about some more info.,"Quick and easy to read, but come on, 175 pages? This all could have been done in a magazine article. I felt a little ripped off."
1,The Worst Internet Book I have Ever Read,"I was pumped when I first recieved this book. I wanted to glean newfounded information on how Internet business works. I wanted to find new insights that were practical to furthering new business ideas.None of these hopes were met by the book. It was a disgrace. For example, chapter 9 talks about how the Internet is going to ""unite the world"" by bringing products and services to everyone. In Chapter 10 they preach how technology doesn't nicely converge, it diverges. Inconsitencies abound!The worst line I read in the entire book was: ""eToys.com, eTrade.com, and Buy.com are all WEAK names."" What are the authors smoking?To sum it up, the book's thesis is WEAK. The backup of their incredulous theories are WEAK. This book is WEAK."
1,Singer Quick and Easy Quilting,The VHS I received is damaged and I am unable to view it. The front of the cartridge which rotates up inside the VCR broke and now is unplayable. I am asking for a replacement. I am unable to rate the video as I was unable to view it.
1,"Bizarre, and not worth the time","In fact, it probably wasn't even worth the time I'm spending on this review. TeenApe is a white kid in a mask, imitating some confused idea of what a black teenager is like. There's also a guy in some kind of rat/animal mask imitating a hispanic teenager. And they're ALL idiots. The ""raunchy"" parts sound like they were written by people who have never been in a room with actual boobies, the ""hilarious"" parts are more like a bunch of hyper-active 13 year olds making poop jokes. Really, really, really not worth the bother."
1,"half fact, half fiction.","There is Heaven and hell only. Read your bible everyday, prey3 times a day and ask god to lead you to salvation."
5,AFTER LIFE SHOULD BE READ BY ALL SINNERS,AS WE ARE ALL SINNERS THIS BOOK ALLOWS US THE GRACE TO PERCEIVE OUR FUTURE BOTH ON EARTH AND THE WORLD TO COME. IT POINTS OUT THAT NO MATTER WHAT OUR PRESENT OR PAST LIFE IS GOOD OR BAD AFTER READING THIS BOOK WE CAN COME TO REALIZE THAT GOD LOVES US ALL. BY TURNING FROM OURSELVES AND TOWARD GOD WE CAN REALIZE THE ONLY THING IN LIFE IS TO KNOW AND LOVE GOD. START TODAY BY PRAYING EVERY DAY FOR THE GRACE TO LEAD A HOLY LIFE. I KNOW THAT I AM.
1,One man's opinion,"This book is the latest in the 500 year old tradition of scaring people into submission. The bottom line is that neither this author nor any other human being that has ever lived (or died and returned after a near death experience) has any idea what awaits us in the afterlife; because no human being has ever completely died and come back. His quotes from ""mystics"" and a few saints who claim to have seen purgatory are ridiculously non-credible. He actually directly quotes the Virgin Mary at one point! The book is pure speculation on the author's part but delivered in a self righteous and dogmatic manner reminiscent of some 15th century inquisitor. Purgatory incidentally is never mentioned anywhere in the Bible but is a medieval Catholic invention. This book is strictly the author's personal speculation and agenda with nothing backing it up."
5,I love this book !!!,"I like the easy to follow instructions and the pictures that go with the projects.I would recommend this book to anyone, experienced or not."
5,Made for Travel,I have used this book often to give me patterns/ideas for gifts and accessories for myself and others....I sew lots and this is one of my favorites!! Mary Mulari has several books....she likes to re-cycle....and so do I....great resource!!
5,GREAT CD!!!,"I've had this CD for about a year and it is, by far, one of the best CD's I own. Like Boston's first album, I never get tired of listening to any of the tracks contained on this CD. Buy it (if you can find it). I paid [$$] and it was worth every penny. Buy the CD! You won't regret it."
5,Recommended,"This is a good book for everyone that want to go a little bit deeper in the Linux Adminstration. In Linux distributions we often find differents solutions to address the same problem. The book can save hours deciding between using solution A or B. It include and overview of the most often used solutions with the pro and cons in some cases. For example: NFS, AFS, Coda and others.All the time the author has the security in mind and this is important for people trying to set boxes on the Internet.If you have a UNIX background that not used for a long time (10 years or so) and you need to go into the Linux server administration. This book certainly will save you a lot of time and will give you the bases to go deeper in the topics that are more important to you.If the above if not your case, I think the book is still a worth too. I will help to understand the pitfalls in Linux administrations a bit deeper.At least, but no less important, I found the book easy to read."
5,A master piece of Progressive Rock.,"A combination of beauty and complexity, Per un Amico is one of the best Progressive Rock album ever. You will love this CD if you like Yes, King Crimson, Emmerson Lake and Palmer, etc..."
3,melodies do not really stand out,"This is not that memorable of a recording, as the style tends to leave a lot of dead space between passages. It's as if the band did not have the technical ability to sustain what they were playing for too long. On top of this, the melodies stick too much to the scales, so it's not very inventive. Fans say it's a ""pretty"" album and I think it's fair to say that it somewhat accomplishes that in the production side of things, but again the melodies are not very interesting at all. I don't agree that this is the masterpiece that everyone thinks it is. But I got another PFM record that is better--Chocolate Kings. Although they sing in English in that one and sound kind of stupid, it rocks! It sounds like a different group to me."
5,As some one put it a masterpiece.,"I had the album when it first came out, I thought it was great then and I feel it is still a classic piece of music now!"
5,How Did It Come To this:,This book is fabulous for all political researchers as it gives the whole timeline of how we got to the present day in our world political movements.I had been hoping for a timeline of the Middle East and America's involvement in it.This is my second Pender book and it won't be my last.
5,Couldn't put it down,"How often do you read a history book that's so engrossing you hate to set it down? Only as an exception, and this book is exceptional. The background is so well established that you'll feel like an island resident yourself by the time that first wave of bombers hit. The occasional humor further lends itself to making the book multi-dimensional and realizing the normality of the civilians and servicemen who became Wake heroes. I was also touched by some attention being paid to what a person's first taste of combat is like. 'It's okay to shoot at these guys, right? To actually try and kill them, right?'It's just an amazing account. Read it - you'll think you lived through the whole thing."
4,YOU HAVE TO LOVE JOHN TO LIKE LOVELAND,"When I first saw this album at Amazon I was surprised to see an album of ballads coming from John Sykes. I will admit it took some time for me to convince myself to order it. Now that I own it I will share with you my perspective. First things first, this is definetly a collection of ballads. They have a variety of flavors though. The styles range from 70's, to very piano oriented, to Beatle-esqe, to the beloved Blue Murder style, to the heavily orchestrated. One thing is consistant here though, John's vocals and his guitars are great. The songs are well written, but sometimes missing. Overall, I would recommend it to those who are fans of his, and if your not familiar with Sykes but are looking for a good album to relax around the house to.....well this could be it. Bright spots include ""haunted"", ""everything I need"", and ""till the day I die""."
4,too soon to tell,"I just started using this product, it has been 6 weeks, I will be able to give a more objective review in the near future"
4,Razzi Rules - snappy and smart,"Razzi's Rules for Staying in Control of the Deal is a rare combination - a fast, engaging read that is also jam-packed with good information. Her snappy writing style keeps you moving through the book while imparting lots of good ideas for the home buying experience. The information is practical and accessible. Following these rules would really feel like you had a ""net"" under you on the high wire act of buying a home."
4,razzi's rules review,execelent book for new home buyers.reviews all the issues needed to evaluate buying a home in concise easy to understand and friendly style
1,What the heck is this suppose to be?,"I'm not one to write reviews, however ""Return From The Stars"" is fantastically bad and I feel compelled to give fair warning. To be fair I read a lot of books, and a share of them are not stellar examples of literature. This collection of dis-associated and cliched ideas, horrible non-cohesive characters, random voice and beats make this, well, collection of words an absolute travesty of story telling, authorship, and heck- rational thought itself.The best part? Morbid curiosity. The unending stream of horrible editing (including, I think, randomly deleted sections) makes for an interesting game of what was that supposed to be? Actually, you know what? That is is the summation of my review. What the heck is this suppose to be? Yes! I have my title!"
4,"re gear for bullet, paperwhite cover","black rubber gear does not work well on base of bullet.paperwhite cover could be similar to kindle fire cover, so you could stand it up instead of holding it."
2,Disappointing,"I understand this was written over 50 years ago when thought processes were different, but this book was just too juvenile for a writer as accomplished as Lem. Must have been a piece that he wasn't quite done with and never got around to finishing.And as for the editing, how could anyone put their name on this garbage?? I'd be embarrassed to put my name on a product with as many typos and grammatical errors as this book. And many reviewers have noted that there is a page or two mixed up. Not sure how that happened but you really are thrown a curve ball when you hit that. I had to force myself to finish it.I got this on special for $1.99 and, quite honestly, it wasn't worth it."
4,What direction is this taking?,"I have always enjoyed Mr Lem's writing and this novel starts so magically with the arrival back on a changed Earth. I felt as mystified and perplexed - even childishly naive - as Bregg did on his return. Do all children feel this way as they grow to know the world around them? And the unfolding of the story was logical and interesting to me. But where was it going? Could Bregg ever integrate usefully into the new world. Clearly he rejected the possibility of a return to the stars. There is only one other possibility available to him. What disturbed me about this novel was the sequence of unlikely events and revelations - built one on top of the other they left me unconvinced in the novel as a novel. However it is a good yarn and has some very interesting observations about what makes a human being, casting some doubt that the result would still be human if some radical changes were made."
4,Old but new...,"Short and bit outdated attempt to look into future of star travel and related consequences (including fate of the Earth). When you will check the date of first publication you will be amazed by the contents. For me it's like a classic work - it was one of books, which built foundation of my perception of the future. If you ever read anything of Lem, you definitely should check this one. If not, this book could be a perfect introduction into Lem's world (and possibly ours)."
4,Nice spark when ZAPPING!,"I purchased this product several weeks ago in anticipation of fly season. It arrived earlier than the shipping date. I give it 4 stars out of 5 only because I had to force 1 of the 2 AA batteries into the holder. Might have been just my unit. I tested the ZAPPING capability personally, since it's still rather cool here, hence very few bugs. Not a pleasant expierience!!!!!Imagine your worst static electricty shock X 100. It actually stings! After I tested it with a finger, I decided I'd try it using a metallic object. I used a small Phillips head screw driver to check whether it would actually produce a spark. Very nice white 1/4"" spark and noise. One word of caution: after pressing both buttons, without a discharge by swatting a bug, this unit will retain a charge. Not sure for how long though. Great product for the price. HAPPY ZAPPING! ENJOY THE LIGHT SHOW!!!! :-)"
1,Bug Zapper,"Product received promptly. Purchased two zappers but could not get batteries to stay in one. The company promptly sent another, which worked OK."
4,A True Classic,"A classic of neo-traditional country music, a combination of country, bluegrass and rock influences. Sung in a voice that sounds perfect to me, there's not a dud in the bunch of great songs on this album."
5,Great Upgrading Platform,"I purchased this computer as an alternative to building my own. What I wanted was a fairly capable gaming machine that wouldn't cost a fortune. After receiving the computer I promptly added an extra 512mb of ram, a standard 400w ATX PSU, and a Nvidia 6600gt. Now this machine truly flies. WoW, Half Life 2, and all the newer games play as smooth as silk on 1024*768 high detail. I have determined that the Athlon 64 3300+ processor does live up to its numbers in real world performance, despite the low L2 cache others might have mentioned. In all the years I've bought and used prebuilt HPs, I have never had quality issues, so I cannot comment on their customer support. However I will say that this computer is the best prebuilt value to date, and I don't regret my descision to purchase it. Kudos HP for creating an quality upgradable machine, and Kudos Amazon for the fast delivery."
4,eclective lover of sound,"Wow! I really enjoyed this CD Rolfe Kent really outdid himself. The music is upbeat, brassy, and great fun. The tracks range from hip upbeat jazz, to breezy Tuscan melodies. I don't think you can go wrong with this soundtrack or the movie. The mood of the album speaks for itself."
4,Cool Soundtrack,while the film was a bit off in spots to me the soundtrck worked from start to finish for me easily. the tempo fit really well with the film scenes&vibe.
3,A joyous evening,"This soundtrack is pleasant to hear, remember the movie, which is great and makes you want to drink wine. (laughs) I like to have this cd in my car. This is not an album of sophisticated jazz. It's nice, happy, makes me happy.I was pleased with the purchase."
5,Great Musical Score,"If you liked the music while watching the movie then you will like this soundtrack. The music is great for many different environmental settings. Driving in a car, Coffee shop, relaxing background, and of course candlelight and a great bottle of wine."
1,"Boring, boring boring...",Disappointing! this is exactly the kind of music that makes you snooze after having drunken too much!!! Rather appropriate with the movie this music is played in!!! Sideways
5,Damn good music,"I really recommend buying this CD - You'll thank yourself. If you live in the Bay Area, California, you absolutely must see them live- CD-recordings do not do them justice. Melissa really gets the crowd going."
3,good but frustrating,"This is a great book for the short time that Bennett is talking about randomness. Unfortunately, that time is only about two chapters. Most of the book is dedicated to a history of how different cultures developed and applied randomizing techniques. The small bit of actual discussion of randomness was fascinating, and left me wondering why she decided to write a history book for the first 10 chapters."
4,"Interesting, without being overly technical","Probability is the least intuitive of the branches of math. People believe all sorts of incorrect ideas about how probability works, i.e. gambler's fallacy. 'Randomness' approaches the subject in an understandable way, avoiding some of the micro details that a textbook would get into. The book also goes into some of the history of thinking about probablity. For example, for years it was thought that throwing dice, drawing lots, etc. those outcomes represented the will of God. I think this book has things of interest for nearly everyone, from expert to layman."
2,Disappointingly Shallow,"This book does two things: It surveys the history of probability and randomness, and it teaches some insights about how people think about randomness and probabilities. It is a short, light read, but it disappoints on both fronts. For history, ""Against the Gods"" by Peter Bernstein is much better (more detailed and more interesting). For insights, ""Fooled by Randomness"" by Taleb is much more insightful."
4,Excelent as a starting point for thought upon the counterintuitive subject of randomness,This book is well written having achieved the goal of presenting a very large and debatable field in a consise and comprehensible way for the non-expert. Ms Bennett has done an excellent wotk in trying to present and dechiper complicated and counterintuitive matters to the human mind without loosing the advantage of attractiveness. A must read for every reader (at least everyone who understands and has intellectually accepted that we are facing with probabilistic matters in our everyday life and being continously susceptible to the element of randomness). Randomness is a far more dominant factor for the human life than people think on average (because most of the time wrongly mix up randomness with skills) and Ms Bennett book can provide the seeds for further exploration deeper into the subject.
4,Ever heard of Godel?,"You can ignore the stars. This is written in response to ""mrbigbeast"": His statement that Zeno's Paradox and other paradoxes like it have been ""debunked"" are totally ludicrous. Hasn't he ever heard of Kurt Godel or Alan Turing? It has been mathematically proven that real logical paradoxes without any resolution exist. There are several accessible books on this subject like *Godel, Escher, Bach.* It's a disgrace that such stupid reviews have weight in the rating process."
2,A little bit disappointed,"I must confess that I read this book with the intention of sharpening my trading skill. I was attracted by the example quoted from this book in a trading book ""Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life -- by Nassim Nicholas Taleb"". Definitely I had made a wrong inference.To me, this book is quite academic. Out of the ten chapters I only found the first and the tenth interesting, with both comprised mainly of life examples and paradoxes. Unless you are really interested in the topic ""Probability"" in an academic or mathematics sense, this might not be suitable for you."
5,COLORFUL and INFORMATIVE!,"This is WONDERFUL book for anyone who loves science and learning! It's very colorful and explains things on a simple level, which is needed for my young elementary aged children. I even enjoyed flipping through this book. It's engaging to the little ones almost IMMEDIATELY because of the colors, larger text and simplicity! The kids don't get lost by all the information. Very well done! We really enjoy this book!!"
5,Love It,"We homeschool and are using the classical method outlined in the Well Trained Mind. We have cut back on all expenditures so I was cautious about purchasing another book - BUT this was definitely worth what I spent for it. Every part of it is written concisely and gives opportunity and ideas for further study topics that peak the children's interest. I would recommend this without reservation for any child. The pictures are great, the writing is easy to understand and factual, and the author does a great job of covering a wide array of topics."
2,Needs fact checking,This book says that there are 600 million people living on earth. I'm stunned that they could be so wrong on something so google-able.My kid really likes the book - too bad they blew that one.
1,Colorful book - bias presentation,"While the book is well made and quite educational, I can not avoid but see the bias of the publisher in presenting the ""world."" I almost wonder what world are they presenting? P. 52-53 the ""City"" depicting NYC without WTC, and the picture of a Mosque in the middle of their ""city"" (no other religious buildings there i.e. no church or synagogue near by). Living in post 9/11 America I find this offensive. This is certainly not the ""world"" I would want my child to live in."
5,Like Bathing in a Milkshake,"This body wash is so smooth and moisturizing you'll feel the difference from the first time you use it. No itchy, no dry, no tight..great for shaving as well. Give it a try today even if you've experienced not enough moisture in the other Dove formulas."
1,Who is writing these reviews?,"I would just like to point out that everybody who has reviewed this book has given it a perfect rating. Also, all the reviews are written in virtually the same voice and style. I'd bet anything that whoever is writing these reviews has a vested interest in selling copies of this book. I'm not trying to convince people not to buy the book, as I haven't even read it. I'd just recommend looking at other sources for reviews before making a purchase."
5,A Love Journal,"Biodun Iginla weaves journal entries into a fine novel about love in the time of tecnhmology. Using the occasion of three romantic relationships, the novel explores whether love--including life itself--is possible when our everyday experiences are fragmented--indeed fractured--by technology and capital. The speed of romance is grounded by the political and cultural events that the author chronicles throughout the novel. This novel could easily have another title: A Love Journal of the 90s."
5,Great Addition to my Nikon D60!,This was well worth the money! The difference in the pictures that I take with this filter are amazing! Especially the pictures that involve the sky.
2,kinf of slow film,"It takes a lot of time in conversations over the people in Bolivia for instance instead of going to the point besides its quite differente to see it in a double way all the film, so it is an ok, film for those who got a lot of time to watch these films"
3,Decent,"This collection is a bunch of decent to terrible public domain films. You can't really expect greatness when you pay $5 for a 20 pack of movies, so I won't complain further. All in all, the films are good quality and a great value for $5."
2,It's okay I guess,"Well I wouldn't have spent $... at the DVD store if I knew it would be this. I mean, it should have had more interviews with them in it. I thought it would be like ""Urethra Chronicles"" from Blink-182 where there was like soo much of the band and actually had their music. I would've fell asleep watching this if I wasn't such a Green Day fan. Buy ""International Superhits"".. you'll acually get to hear and see the band instead of this british lady as the narrator and unheard-of people (b-sides Op Ivy singer Jesse Micheals) for an hour."
4,Dasheikz2Centz: I Wanna Give It 5 Stars So Bad!,"I can't believe how great these beats were and still are. I would have cut off my left pinky finger to be blessed with these beats. With that said. Lil Dap & Nutcracker MUST'VE been Premos boys because they were garbage on the mic. Now Lil Dap knew how to ride the beat better than Nutcraker but still... Anyway, I think this is Premos best album just because he was SICK on the beats. Like DAMN!! This is definitely a ghetto classic. If this aint your type of album I can't even mess wit' you."
3,DJ Premier...feat. Group Home,"I can think of 2 senisible reasons why Premo made this album; 1) Pity for homeboys Lil' Dap & Melachi. 2) He wanted to prove that he could make two of the worst rappers in NY sound good.This album gets 3 stars for the production alone. Premo spawned this LP when he was spinning his best work. Group Home benefit from the dirty, laid-back beats, because it suits their very simple flows. This a perfect album to listen to when you're really drunk or stoned, you can just bob your head to the catchy beats and the rhymes are slow and uncomplex.Bottom Line: Amazing beats, pitiful lyrics. 3 stars. Peace"
4,"Pound-for-pound, one of the best","You have to really give this album its due. I mean two sixteen-year-olds in '95 made this provocative work. Now don't get me twisted, this album wouldn't have me nearly as gassed without Premier's stellar, polyrhythmatic production. But, all at once, for a couple of teenagers from East New York, these two made one hell of a work at the apocalypse of hip-hop when all the artists were basically turning commercial. This is definitely one of the last albums, along with Jeru tha Damaja's Wrath of the Math, that reflected the street life to it's most pure, violent, but all at once gorgeous extent. What stands this album out from all the rest, however, is that although the album possesses violent, street-compromising roughness, it doesn't glorify it, as expressed in Melachi and Lil' Dap's lyrics and general tones throughout the album. Truly, a remarkable release"
4,Dopest beats with the wackest rhymes.,"This album, when it came out, was a rarity. DJ Premier does not produce a lot of albums completely. He was just, at this point, perfecting that Primo signature sound. The beats on this album are some of his dopest. I cant say he wasted them on Melachi and Lil Dap but I will say that those beats deserved someone better (Could you imagine this being the Gang Starr album that filled the '94-98 void?). These two rapping over Primo's beats is like a Rolls Royce with a bad paint job. Melachi says, ""It's a wonderful world, a world of wonder, I thunder I thunder I won't go under"". I laugh out loud at some of their lyrics. They are the weakest rappers to rap over Primo beats. That's loyalty for you though. It's a 5 star album for beats but a 1 star album for lyrics."
4,Nice!,"Good album although the lyricists on it are'nt the greatest, the beats make up for it. Great production by D.J. Premier. Nice beats."
4,1995 pure premo dope,"A dope disc of smooth beats by DJ Premiere and hard rhymes by lil dap and the nutcracker. It takes you back to better times. The lyrics are not graduate level but overall it hits the mark. If you enjoy 90's gritty hip hop, get it fast before it goes out of print."
4,This proves...,"That you can have a dope album with wack lyrics. Trust me, I think the LP is a classic, but when serriously listening to the lyrics you wonder how the heck they got in the Gang Starr Foundation. But, I guess as Guru said, ""Its mostly the voice."" A lot of the cuts on here are dope, but if you can find the bootleg inst version... cop it!"
2,Advertising in America,"I was expecting a book full of high resolution beautiful pictures all I got was a book that looked like it belonged in the 1800s. What horrible pictures and some of the most famous American ads weren't even included. Just a disaster of a book. I unfortunately ended up throwing this book into the trash, which I've never done before. Stay away and don't waste your money!"
4,Martina Jacobs offers new insight into the world of kachinas,"The world of kachina ceremonies and dolls is largely unkown people outside of the South West. Luckily, Martina Jacobs has written an in-depth look into the culture of the Hopi and their traditions. The cultural significance of the kachinas and their ceremonies is thoroughly explained in the book."
3,The best band nobody's heard of!,"This album is a treasure to those who love the raw sound of live music. Especially, if that live music is coming from a good band. The songs are good and the music is tight, as the Tragically hip roll through bit and pieces of both their past and present. Despite Gordon Downey's(Lead singer) sometimes silly ramblings he and the band remain strong and deliver a great sounding solid album."
3,not bad but could have been so much better,"I've seen the Hip in Washington DC, Montreal and twice in Winnipeg and every show was better than the one on this disc. It's so strange: the things to look forward to in a Hip show are not here... no 15-minute extended jams or embryonic songs-within-songs, and more importantly gord's banter on this album is retarded, which is so weird because it's ususally the high point of any show. When I saw them in DC he went on a rant about the Quebec referendum and then uttered the immortal words `Mike Harris: He's a golf pro! He's a hockey coach! He's a c-nt!'"
2,Second rate container book,I heard this book was great. No. I learned nothing new. I'll have to go to library and see what is really helpful.
4,Bountiful Container,This is like an encyclopedia for new gardeners like me.It gives advice for every veggie and flower and helpswith ideas for combining plants so you get a good-sizedharvest.
1,Not Meant for Beginners,"I bought this book because a lot of people recommended it. I think its great if (1) you're up for ALOT of reading (its 432 pages long), and (2) if you want to know EVERYTHING there is to know about container gardening. Personally, I felt this book had TOO much information. I found myself swimming in information about how to choose the right plant container for the deck of a boat - seriously, that's in there. Wayyy too much information for someone who has killed 4 ""oh so easy to maintain"" ivy plants. All I wanted was a small container garden with some peppermint, sage and a few tomatoes. This book however is so overwhelming. If you're a newbie like me, go for ""Easy Container Gardening"" by Pamela Crawford. Loved it! Simple and to-the-point."
3,Not what I expected,"Unfortunately, although I read very good reviews on this book, it is not what I expected and doesn't cover many vegetables in great detail. Most of what I'm growing in containers is not covered in this book, which is what I was hoping for. Probably my fault, I should have researched more before buying."
5,A great book that is turning my thumb green!,"This book provides wonderful information about growing edibles in a container. I have never had any success growing anything before, but with this book, I have found that I can successfully grow beautiful plants on my apartment balcony. I particularly like the suggested theme gardens and succession gardens. They are pretty and whimsical and fun. The only problem is that I think I am getting overly ambitious for next year!"
4,Good value,"This bevel gauge has a boring plastic handle rather than a pretty hardwood one. Uh... who cares? The parts fit nicely together. The knob is easy to turn and tightens down nicely. Basically, it works. Good value."
2,Blade doesn't lock securely.,"The blade in this bevel will not securely lock, so it is a dud. Too bad; having a level built into the handle is a nice touch. But if the blade doesn't lock, you risk having it slip and giving an incorrect angle."
5,Remembering a Time of Great Change,"Growing up in the deep south during the civil rights era, I can remember school being closed because the KKK had called a big rally. Even at the time I can remember watching the television news the night Brown vs. Board of Education (separate but equal education was not equal at all) and realizing that the world was about to change.It's good to read this book and review what happened through the eyes of a professional reporter who was actually there for most of the action.The title talks about the 'Rough South.' And indeed it was. In looking back on it with fifty years of perspective, it was an amazing transition. And all in all, it was not nearly as rough as it could have been. There were a lot of people there who really hated each other and on both sides. Today there is still some racial friction in the south, but not even a shadow of what it was then.This is a remerberance of a time of great fundamental change in out culture very well told."
3,Son of the Rough South,This is very strong but unfortunately realistic look at the south duringthe late 1920's into the 60's. There are several parts that have disturbingsexual references. I only got the book because it had references to somepeople on my family tree.
2,Son Of The Rough South,"My granddaughter recommended this book to me. She is studying the civil rights movement at Rutgers University. It is one of the most outstanding books I have ever read. It is sad, funny, colorful, and true.Karl Fleming is my new hero. I am also from North Carolina, went to the same college, and am only a few years younger, so I can identify with many of his experiences. He is a very brave person to have taken a stand against segregation when he did. Many of us cringed at the mistreatment of Blacks in those days but were afraid to speak up.In addition, Karl's ability to describe surroundings and provide details made me feel that I was there. Sometimes I was there. I, too, took modern dance from Joy Kirchner,the red headed teacher at Appalachian. I knew the English professor who was crazy about Shakesphere and had liquor on his breath. But, that is not what makes the book outstanding. Karl Fleming is just a great, great writer. You will be glad you read this book"
2,What am I missing?,"I was hoping for an informed history of the civil rights movement in America. Instead, I found this book to be Fleming's catharsis. I don't care about his sexual experiences, and although they may have scarred him or contributed to his personality quirks, they have nothing to do with the civil riights movement. The ""I was a poor orphan"", while touching, could have been reduced from 300 pages to about 30. Do not waste your time."
2,"hmmm, not what i expected",The artwork is beautiful on the moon sign card. I found the explanations very open to interpretation and much more complicated than the traditional astrological method.
1,Poor imitation of Wilton Armetale.,"From its description it's obvious that Lenox tried to copy Wilton Armetale quality and design. They achieved the look, but not the quality. The butterly meadlow metal line is pretty, I own four pieces, but unfortunately they have stained and look horrible after a few months of use. I guess they are just meant to sit there on the kitchen counter and look pretty without daring to put something in."
4,Mitchell Tree - Touching,"I got this cd because I had read about Mitchell Tree's inspiring story. From dealer to healer is a long way to go in one lifetime. Upon listening I was more than really surprised to find myself putting it on over and over again as I drove to work or anywhere else I had to go. This stuff grows on you like moss. Passenger after passenger asked who it was and where they could get a copy. Why? The music has a pulsating, driving sound to it and the lyrics are simple, clean and true. What else can you ask from a cd? This guy is a serious guitar jock and unlike alot of the rabble out there, he has something to say. Finding form and content in a music cd is rare today, Mitchell Tree delivers."
5,The hottest egyptian sensation has done it again!!!,"I love Amr Diab because he is the best young male egyptian singer! His voice makes a woman's heart race and drop. I'm egyptian, so of course I love all his cds.... but this is a wonderful addition to his past ones!! If you love egyptian music, then you will love Amr Diab's newest cd "" Tamally Maak ""!!"
4,First-Time Listener,"This album was suggested to me by a dear friend. I trusted him, and hey, I like it. The first song really has you going--arabic pop is very similar to latino pop... So, despite listening to arabic music, I felt like dancing the salsa to the entire album. Some songs are a little slow... And Amr's lyrics are definitely sentimental. If you want to compare him to someone else, I would have to go with the Turkish Tarkan."
5,Fantastic,"This album is a magnificent selection of songs only Amr Diab could sing. The beginning with the rhytm of ""El 'Alem Alah"" (""God Knows""), followed by the melodious ""Tamaly Ma'ak"" (""Always With You""), the salsa-like ""Alby Ekhtarak"" (""My Heart Choose YoU""), and my favourite ""We Heya Amla Eh Delwat"" (""How is she doing""). 10 great songs and I think everyone who loves arab music or want to know something about modern styles in arabic music, this is a must."
4,An Old-School Style Thriller.,"I guess Clint Eastwood is going to be one of the rare action icons that ages gracefully and with dignity.....Blood Work is another classy film from the legendary Actor/Director.Eastwood plays an aging F.B.I. profiler on the trail of ""The Code Killer""; He suffers a career-ending Heart attack while chasing the killer, and winds up needing a heart transplant. Two years into his retirement he is contacted by the sister of a recent murder victim looking for his help finding her killer. Why him? Well, his new heart belonged to her sister.The movie is very tightly constructed, and to say much more would give away the surprises. I didn't have much of a problem following the clues, and I was able to deduce the identity of the killer and his connection to Eastwood, but the movie is so good that I really didn't mind. Eastwood has constructed a rock-solid thriller very reminiscent of his earlier work, and no matter how old he is, he still kicks butt!"
3,Read the book...,"I give kudos to Mr. Eastwood for seeing a great book in the novel - Michael Connelly is a gifted writer - and developing a movie, however, the movie does not have the suspense of the book.As a devout reader of crime mystery, I had to have this movie for my library because it was a Michael Connelly novel - no other reason. It was distressing not to at least have an interview on the DVD with Mr. Connelly. The acting is mostly mediocre, with the exception of Eastwood. Buddy is miscast with Daniels, as is Graciela with DeJesus. I like the work of Daniels, and he would have been better in the cop role.If you want a good cop movie, by another great writer, try the Onion Field."
4,Good Eastwood Movie,"This movie has had mixed revews not so much by criticts but by people who saw it,but I liked this movie because it keeps you interested all through the movie with plot twists and unexpected turns.When I saw this movie I compaired it to a movie that came out eleyer in the year called Insomnia. Insomnia was very dull and laked new material but Blood Work didn't do that and I am glad. I compaired Blood Work with Insomnia because they are both cop dramas and I find That cop dramas cas sumtimes be very dull and they lak material like Insomnia(although Robin Williums gave a good performance)."
2,Disappointing,"The movie was less interesting than the synopsis on the back of the case. I figured an Eastwood movie would be better, but it was way too predictable, old, boring, and didn't keep my attention garnered to it.Unnecessary cussing makes the film even less of an enjoyment.I regret spending a dollar to rent this. Please skip it."
2,Beyond Silly,"Taking Ridiculous to New Levels!! First off, Paul Rodriguez should NOT have been cast in this role. He's a no-talent hack with the personality of a 2 by 4, and his presence in this movie dragged it down to the point of unwatchability. Jeff Daniels was an annoying boob too, if ya wanna know. The dead girl's sister could not act either, and the stiff acting on everyone's part taken in conjunction with the plot holes and story defects.......anyway, get the point? Whole thing was just a stretch to me. Watching an 80 yr. old bag a 30 yr. old is a joke. Guess that's the only way Clint can get some action, huh? And the shootout in the street was so stupid and would have never happened. I almost turned it off there. Clint failed miserably on this one, and I think he's one of all-time American greats in cinematic history. While the story should have been interesting, it was not. Fails even as light entertainment, as there's just too many faults to overlook."
2,Snore,"Bad, bad, bad. This was a lackluster film that seemed so formulaic it may as well have been written by a computer program designed to churn out a ""thriller"". The dialogue is laughably poor (especially the supporting cast, e.g. the cops). I'm still scratching my head and wondering what on earth enticed Clint to direct this, and fine actors like Anjelica Huston to appear in it. It's even more depressing to realize that the screenwriter in question was responsible for one of the best films of the 90s: LA Confidential. How the mighty have fallen."
1,EMBARASSING,"I ALMOST DIED WATCHING CLINT EASTWOODS LAST MOVIE, TRUE CRIME,OUT OF BOREDOM, BUT THIS MOVIE HAS TAKEN MY SOUL. WHAT EXACTLY IS CLINT TRYING TO PROVE? THAT WHEN YOU GET OLD, LIFE SUCKS. THAT WHEN YOU HIT 60, EVERYTHING YOU DO IS BORING? I SIMPLY CANT BELIEVE ANYTHING CAN BE AS HIDEOUS AS THIS MOVIE. AS FOR EVERYONE WHO GIVES THIS MOVIE 5 STARS, GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF CLINTS A$$!"
1,Needs to Be Checked For for a Pulse,"For the first time in years I decided to forgo my antipathy toward CE & watch one of his flicks. I actually thought that the lame plot described on the box was the result of poor salesmanship. Also I thought that there would be no trouble finding a good script for a major box office draw like Mr. Eastwood. No such luck.This film is a clunker from stem to stern & the presence of old Clint just scuttles any chance of rising above the script's limitations. I am stunned that such a major presence in Action Cinema would turn in such a paint-by-number episode.I rank this film as neck & neck with Stallone's ""Cop Land"" for sheer boredom & paucity of surprises. Not being a fan I'm certain it's the last time I'll look at one of this clowns movies."
1,The book is fascinating; the movie fails it.,"I'm a retired attorney. I enjoy crime novels and the movies that bring them to us visually. However, this movie simply is a pain to watch, IF one enjoyed the drama of the book. The book ""Blood Work"" is very detailed and the solution to the ""who done it"" is very well hidden. I won't bore you with details but if you want to know how the movie compares with the novel, read the review by ""km southern"" dated Oct 19, 2004, that is available below. She is right on. The movie has so many flaws that even without having read the book upon which it purports to be based, it is a poor choice."
2,"Not Eastwoods best,In-need of a much better script","Kinda a slow movie just talk talk talk and talk and only a 15 min of action in a 2 hour movie, I like Eastwoods acting alough it will remind you very much of Dirty Hairy.I think it would have been more intresting if the killer would have been more like Dr.Lecter (Hannibal) have some sort of tourture and mystery behind it instead of a guy running in and instantly shotting at someone. But cant dwell on our loss's.Rent it I dont think it will be something you should buy, This story should have just stayed a book not have been made into a movie wihtot adding any action."
2,Predictable and Boring,"I bought this DVD and wasted my money. Clint's acting was wooden and I thought he was doing that because of his character's heart transplant. But when the whole cast's acting was the same way, it was pitiful to watch. If anyone couldn't figure out who the killer was after 20 mins plus a crispy creme comercial plus the plot was just a generic serial killer B- movie type."
3,Solid detective movie with a heart,"A Clint Eastwood movie with a detective that isn't Dirty Harry.It has some good twists on organ donation and blood type.I really doubt the writers know anything at all about the subjectas an A negative Mexican is probably pure fiction...O positive maybe.I thought at first it was the doctor hiring a hit man to get hearts for her patients ( might be a nice psychopathic twist), but it was just a crazy serial killer in the end."
3,Not all that great but far from bad.,This movie is a rather average crime drama about a retired FBI agent who recieved a heart transplant from a murder victim and is now on the case of solving the murder and finding who is behind the heinous crime that took place at a convenience store.He gets out of retirement after being asked by the sister of the murder victim to help her track down the one responsible for the crime. This serial killer targets individuals who have blood types that match that of the former retiree.This movie is good to a degree but the whole thing is just watered down by a very predictable outcome and does nothing to make it very memorable. The acting has seen better days as well.Not a bad film but this could really have been a lot better in my honest opinion.
3,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * * 1/2,"Who would like this? : crime/mystery buffs, clint eastwood fans.Worth seeing...-in the theatre: maybe-buy it : maybe/yes-rent it : yes*now that I know who the killer is I doubt I'll watch this again soon."
3,"PREDICTABLE, BUT CLINT IS ALWAYS GREAT! 3 1/2 STARS!","It's hard to find fault in Eastwood, even when he makes a predictable crime drama, it's always entertaining. While Blood Work's story is interesting and moves along smoothly, I did figure out the killer long before it was revealed. The ending is a little silly, but it doesn't distract from the rest of the film. Overall if you like Clint Eastwood films, then you'll like this one, even though he has done much better films, this is certainly not his worst."
2,Not the Book,"Don't expect Connelly's Blood Work in this movie. The story starts out nearly word for word from Connelly's book, however the Eastwood McCaleb is probably a good 30 years older than Connelly's McCaleb - what a disappointment. I cringed every time I saw Eastwood run or fire a gun. At one point in the movie, McCaleb and cop Winston recklessly blast out all of the windows of a speeding car for no apparent reason and then act as if nothing happened. Huh? Somewhere along the line, the movie diverges drastically from the book to the point where the real murderer turns out to be a completely different character. Too bad so much of the original book was lost in translation."
1,Killer butchers book,"Connelly's Blood Work is a pretty good novel, tightly plotted, quick-paced. This movie butchers it, adding nonsensical plot elements and overly wordy dialog.The opening scene is already absurdly cliched, and ruins the atmosphere. Throughout, the dialog, acting, and directing borders on the inept. Veering between pointless additions to the book and overly literal interpretations of key scenes, this movie is unwatchable."
5,As good as it gets!,"This is Eastwood at his finest. He plays an aging officer in pursuit of a serial killer like an older Dirty Harry. His moves are more subtle but very deliberate. What I found fascinating to the film was the subplot of the heart transplant's connection to the bigger picture. It is a convoluted tale that seems a bit far fetched at first but slowly it begins to dawn on you just what's going on. Don't let anyone call you stupid for not figuring out the whodunit. I'm a great reader of suspense thrillers and I was without a clue. The acting by all (DeJesus, Rodriguez and Jeff Daniels) was excellent. Great cast and crew; great director. If you like Eastwood at all you'll love this picture."
3,Blood Work,"This movie is based on the novel Blood Work by Michael Connelly. I am a big fan of Connelly's novels and, after reading the book, was looking forward to seeing the film. I am also a fan of Clint Eastwood, who starred in the film. I liked him in the part. It was very disappointing to me that the movie did not exactly follow the book. In fact the change that was made, made it very improbable, if not impossible, for them to make a film of any of Connelly's books that follow this one which are based on the same character."
3,For Clint Fans,"If you're a Clint fan, then this movie will entertain you. However, don't expect too much suspense.As soon as I saw the ""bad guy"" I knew ""who did it"", and the most obviuos clue was way too obviuos."
3,Stick with the book.,"Finally got around to renting this. I was pretty disappointed in the changes that were made. The book is more detailed and contains a completely different outcome. Jeff Daniels put in a good performance, but the filmakers dropped the ball making him the villian when in the book he plays Terry's good buddy not bright enough to be a criminal mastermind."
2,Piles on the cliches,"The innocent black man mistakenly convicted of murder; the last-minute attempt for a reprieve. Been there; done that. All that was needed was a close-up of the telephone at the gas chamber and a close shot of the warden sweating before throwing the switch. Oh wait, we got those too.If you want a nice antidote to these cliches, may I recommend ""Just Cause,"" which, although filled with plenty of cliches of its own (including a hysterical flickering-lights-while-the-electric-chair-is-turned-on scene) ends up with an unexpected bad guy and a few innocent bodies to boot."
1,"Formulaic plot, stilted acting","I don't know what happened to the plot in this movie, but it certainly seems like some crucial bits of information got lost. Eastwood and De Jesus give performances that are worthy of an amateur theatre group. The leaps of intuition that Eastwood's character takes are beyond belief, while the systematic whittling down of suspects is expected, and of course, the true villain is revealed just before the end, in all his glorious insanity, he has kidnapped De Jesus and her nephew, and uses this to keep Eastwood's character from shooting him. The movie ends with the typical 'good guy chases bad guy around empty, creepy place', with de Jesus getting in her revenge by pushing the dying villain's face under water. Full of bad lines, and worse acting, I would recommend skipping this one. Instead, watch Insomnia with Al Pacino."
2,Utterly useless,"Man, seldom I've witnessed something like this movie, which was supposed to be a ""thriller"". Nothing against CLint, much on the contraty: he chose a script and adpated it to his real age,a honest and clever movement.But the trouble is that seldom I've witnessed a thriller where you can DEFINITELY know who is the killer the first time he appears on the screen!! Amazing! SO obvious, so ludicrous! I'll not give his name (Spoil), but I guarantee you'll see it also... Sad...THis made me angry!"
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz.....The book is better..,"If you can't guess who the killer is after the first 30 or so minutes then this movie is for you! I saw this at the theatre, which was filled with a ""mature"" audience. ""Uh-Oh"" I said as I sat down; and I was right, this film is very boring. Murder She Wrote + Dirty Harry - Harry's Magnum .44 attitude = Blood Work. That's the movie formula and formulaic is an apt description of this flick. Trust me, the book is much better - get it on tape and forget this film."
2,Tired Blood,"This is just another killer-obsessed-with-cop movie; ""Dirty Harry"" as an old man with a heart condition. Poor old Clint should really retire from both acting and directing. His voice has grown so low and horse I could barely understand his lines. ""Blood Work"" is a flat-out depressing movie to watch and at times horrifically dull. The only thing that kept me awake was my astonishment at how perfectly sappy and overly sentimental the script was."
5,Lever's Great Scent in Liqued Form,"My husband has been using Lever for several years now, and although I LOVE the scent, I just can't fathom using bar soap! Then, while shopping at the local pharmacy, I noticed that Lever had come out with a liqued version & I decided to give it a try, and now I'm hooked. The scent is great (and it lasts quite a long time), and I just feel really clean after using it.Overall, I would highly recommend this soap to anyone who enjoys Lever's scent, and who prefers to wash with liqued, as opposed to bar soap."
4,I liked the Lever 2000 Pure Rain body ...,"I liked the Lever 2000 Pure Rain body wash for several different reasons. The fragrance is light and fresh, not heavy and not too feminine. My husband also liked it for the same reason. It takes only a little on my wash puff to wash my entire body, and it feels like it washes clean. I would buy this product again."
4,"Lever 2000 Family Body Wash, Pure Rain has ...","Lever 2000 Family Body Wash, Pure Rain has all of the deodorant soap protection as deodorant bar soap without leaving a bar soap residue or film on your skin, shower doors and tiles. My husband and son like it very much. I think that the Pure Rain fragrance is a bit overwhelming -- especially for women who prefer a lighter scent. But, it works well for men and boys. I would buy it only if I had a coupon or if it were on sale."
4,"I HATE country music, but....","Like most people that are actually FROM Nashville, I hate country music, but these guys aren't your typical country band. BR5-49 is the punk rock of country bands. They got all of the humor (""Me n' Opie Down by the Duck Pond,"" ""Bettie Bettie"") and catchy sounds (""Hillbilly Thang"") that keep most punk bands going. Why can't all country be like this? I can't wait to get their self-titled studio album..."
2,"It's okay, but...",The CD has few standouts. Little swing or twang. It's kinda lukewarm. The highlights are their bantering between songs like a true bar band. A couple of times listening to it is enough. Sold my copy and don't miss it. I'm satisfied with their first release.
3,Infatuated with Universals,"I would call this dictionary an average reference book. It contains pictures to keep the graphically inclined happy. The marginalia directing readers to related topics is helpful. The longer articles giving more general descriptions are fun to read. On the other hand, Tressider seems to try too hard to come up with universal meanings for the symbols he describes, pointing out the common elements while ignoring instances where a symbol may have radically different meaning. His articles are often short and incomplete. This is not as comprehensive a book as Chevalier's Dictionary of Symbolism (which I would recommend for the serious student of art and literature over this one), but many readers will find it's clean format and short explanations entertaining and attractive. It deserves to be part of a library of symbolism, but I would not make it my only source."
3,Useful and I got it on sale so....,I found the book useful for my publishing business ( an RPG company) and I have used the book to stir the grey matter as it where when coming up with ideas.
4,1966 Virginia Ghosts paperback,"This book is a pleasant change from the sensational books written by today's ghost researchers. It is impeccably written, with no ego trips by ""psychics."" Over a hundred historical sites are described, with historical background for each and vintage photos of many sites. In a few cases there are pictures of the individuals thought to be haunting the sites. The stories of the kinds of ghostly activity that were observed are, for the most part, quite credible. This book could be the guide for a fascinating vacation in Virginia."
5,Great knock-off,"I got these two batteries for SO MUCH less than a Canon brand backup, and they work just as well! I can't tell when I'm shooting (I'm a wedding photographer) which battery is in the camera, one does not seem to run out more quickly than the other. A great alternative to letting Canon empty your wallet."
5,Excellent buy,It was a no brainer. Buy a newer camera for $150+ or spend $4.50 on a battery that would cost 5 times as much at a battery or camera store. It was charged ready to go right out of the bag.
2,too glittery for red but black is pretty.,the red colour its too glittery for women but little girls can wear with a dress.In pictures it does not look the way it does in reality.only buy if u have a little girl.black one looked pretty on me.liked that for woman.
5,beautiful and effective,"These bobby pins are very cute and also are long enough to work with my thick hair (when it's pulled back or used to secure a scarf / headband). I've made several orders of hair clips from this seller and all have arrived quickly, in good condition, and as depicted."
5,A really Good Christmas Album,"Great album with songs by great performers. The music was as good as the movie. I really enjoyed Sarah McLachlan's Song For A Winter's Night, and Natalie Cole's Jingle Bells."
2,Bullet Proof? Not Really...,The product was ok. It did a nice job of covering the phone but the clip on the back broke off after a couple of months of normal use. You can still use the shield but becomes much less useful.
3,nice black rzr v3 case,"I recieved this case 2 days BEFORE the estimated shipping date. Very impressive. It is nylon (not leather) and kind of plain. But then I'm comparing it to my Hot pink case, lol! The clip makes it bulky. You can take the clip off and use the ring to hang a wristlet strap, but the plastic clip attachment won't come off and it sticks out (kinda aggravating)."
2,Shutter Lag,"There is so much shutter lag in this camera that any kind of action shot is just pure luck. Specifications never publish this kind of measurement, but I'm sure the lag time is at least 1.3 seconds. I also have the Optio S and this thing is five times as bad. I'm writing this reveiw while on vacation in Cozumel and I put the Optio SV back in my bag and will finish my vacation using the Optio S."
5,Pentax Optio SV Digital Camera,"This camera takes amazing pictures. It has a ton of functionality, which I have not figued out yet. It will take some time, but it will be worth it."
3,at first I was not sure,I was not sure. I thought I really liked him on Idol I will buy it give him a chance. That song Gallery I love I think it is perfect for him. I am so glad this cd came out. That song one shot I love. I think it showes a slow side to his voice. I think he with this cd would not have won idol because it is not better then bo bice or carrie underwoods cd. I think it was better then Diana Fantasia and rubben and justin guarrini's first cd's. I think he is going to do well. I do not think you all will for sure like it but I enjoy it.
2,Highly disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this CD. I was expecting much more after buying and listening to the Cesar CD. I can't complain about Mario's singing, but the song selection and style was no where near as good as the Cesar CD. I was expecting the beautiful latin style and rhythms. This was cheap hip hop sounding."
1,Amazon censors reviews critical of this series,"Amazon censors reviews of this product as they may be critical of a perverted, deviant lifestyle championed by Liberals. This is a blatant attempt by those of a certain ""community"" to destroy the ""values"" of a majority of the populace."
4,"Important, compelling and inspiring","Got this book fresh off the press and as one who knows of West but who never read anything by him before, I found the start of the book exciting and well thought out. West intelligently writes about the history of democracy in this country, our schizophrenic attitude and the trouble we are in now. There are a few chapters that seem to get a tiny bit off course or take one topic and stretch it too long but in general, West provides very compelling ideas on democracy matters, why democracy matters and lights a spark for why we need to get back into the democratic experiment with some fire and commitment. The great thing is that it is not a bashing event though there is opportunity aplenty, as most of us know. West has optimism and embraces the potential and opportunity ahead. Well worth it."
1,How did this get published?,"Cornell West is the Shakespeare of our time. His book is unreadable; you need cliff notes and a dictionary to get through it. I can sum up this work in three words ""Plutocratic Imperial Nihilism"" translation ""Rich White Guys are taking over the world and they don't care."""
3,Good but nothing new.,"While I agree with most of what Cornell West has to say, I've also heard it all before. There's nothing really original or particularly profound in this book. What I found annoying, however, was the constant name-dropping. I know that Mr. West is a smart guy; he doesn't need to drop the names of every philosopher and the title of every great work he's ever read (and lighten up with the barrage of adjectives, too. That's just Writing 101). This seemed like a very ""off-the-cuff"" kind of work, both in style and content. I had expected something more."
1,Marxoid rant against America,This book is nothing more worthless babblings. Intelligent people who read his book will discover for themselves what a second-rate ideologue and empty intellectual suit West is without anyone's help.
4,Vash the Stampede has returned,"After the show's conclusion over ten years ago, it's great to be able to revisit Vash and company once again without missing a beat. The movie itself plays out like nothing more than an extended episode of the show, but it's still good for some laughs and excitement."
3,Okay but not like the series,"movie didn't show any of the unique points that the series has like honor, kindness, and connecting relationships. I would not buy this movie. The movie was thrown together were a lot of stuff was explained in the ending credits."
3,Good anime but not to much action.,"Im not a fan of Trigun, Im just a guy who thinks that action is far more important than the story, concept, art and ect. I think that Trigun is more like comedy than anything else.I must admit that the few action scenes were superb. The animation is fast-paced high-quality (what do you expected from Madhouse?) but the action is always interrupted by blah! blah! blah! I HATE THAT! At least, the creators of the serie made this movie, so fans of Trigun might be so pleased for that.If you are looking for silly comedy with a little of crazy action and a interesting concept then this anime might be for you. But if you are looking for NON STOP INSANE ACTION like Redline, Spriggan, or Final Fantasy A.C. then search somewhere else. I don't think that this movie was made for action junkies like me. :(Adios."
2,trigun movie,great movie to bad the one (bluray) i got had no video last 5 mins. rather upset and disapointed at senders quality...
3,"Not bad, but not great","I might as well mention my expectations were sky-high for this movie, so perhaps I'm not being 100% fair..This movie pretty much plays out like most of the episodes, Vash starts goofy, then gets serious and helps someone who wasn't inherently bad realize the errors of their ways...To be honest I think the problem was it was hard to really get involved with the new characters with a short time period to get to know them in. I loved the humor at the beginning/middle of the movie, but when it came time to be serious I just didn't really feel anything for the new guys.All in all it felt like too much crammed into a short movie, kind of like Serenity was to Firefly. Decent movie but man I wished it could have been made into more episodes."
4,"One long, standalone episode","Watch this if you want to see a long, somewhat tame episode. In the extra features, the author explains that he wanted anyone to be able to watch it, without having read or seen the series before. As a fanboy, I was happy to see some of my favorite characters again, but disappointed with the lack of depth."
5,trigun badlands rumble,great movie that shows vash and his usual goofy self just as he was 9 years ago in the series. trigun badlands rumble is in my opinion a must have to any trigun collection.
5,One of the best R&B Albums,"With their Melodic Harmony and thoughtful lyrics Boyz to Men has transgressed a level to which I believe that few groups have yet reached and will reach. Their songs seem to somehow affect the people listening to them, a sure sign of their quality and talent. Although Evolution did not get as much attention or make as many sales as their record breaking album Boyz to men 2, it does not fall any short on the quality of songs it has. Just about every song on the album is good with the most memorable ones being ""Doin Just fine (melodic and smooth)"" , ""4 Seasons of Loneliness (Faster Paced with blending of voices and music), ""Just Hold On (Which can easily be mistaken for poetry)"" and finally ""A song for Mama (Soulfood)"" and ""Dear god"". Boyz to Men have been and will always remain the best of the best when it comes to Melodic R&B. Hey don't take my word for it, just listen to their songs."
5,A lovely treat!,These are a wonderful little treat that go great with coffee or tea. I brought these to work with me to share with some co-workers and doled them out as if they were gold! A pair of cookies are wrapped in tissue so they look a lot more special than just a couple of cookies. My co-workers were very impressed with them! This package has just enough for a small group of friends to share.
4,Unique Sweet,"I bought these to make a crust for an Italian cheesecake, but I love the idea of the little twisted individual wrappers! Each contains two tiny cookies, very sweet and light as air, that basically melt in one's mouth....especially with a good swallow of espresso! Only drawback: a little "" crumby"" on a linen tablecloth."
4,Just the best cookies with morning coffee,"I would never have thought to buy cookies through Amazon. But my local grocery stories don't carry these wonderfully almond-flavored bite-sized morsels of deliciousness.I was therefore so pleased to discover I could purchase these and have them shipped and delivered to me quickly. With a morning tea or coffee, or in the evenings after dinner, these cookies are the perfect ending. Not too big, just sweet enough, with a nutty sweetness that might make you forget they are in fact a cookie.I must order more very soon."
2,Meh. *Spoilers Maybe*,"This story (as brought out in other reviews) is about a college student enlisted as a government agent...who is then double-crossed by his lover, working for the same people as he.While this story has been done many time before, it was interesting for a first and last time read. The story doesn't really have a middle that goes into depth, we just learn that the main character dislikes his life as a spy, and suddenly he is marked for death; there is no drama, no mystery of who is going to do him in. Moreover, we don't really see the main character change. Sure, he thought he was going to be James Bond, but he 'wants out' since he feels the job is boring; and he only sees 'action' when it is clear he doesn't want to live the life of espionage.I am a fan of 'Powers' and 'Torso' by the same author, Brian Michael Bendis. Unfortunately, this story needed a bit more to it."
4,"if you loved her in the NY TIMES, you'll love her novels","First a suggestion: when writing a review, don't tell the ending and when reading a review, try your best not to read a suggestion of an ending. Reading the ending before I got to it in the book was a terrible disappointment though the ending still was different than I expected. There are a lot of memorable phrases in the book and some that seem to have been worked on too much but (although I am a man) she seemed to have caught extremely well the complicity between beater and beaten that must go on. I have a 10-year old boy and the boy was caught beautifully. Thanks, Anna"
4,A chick book.,"The book is written in the first person, which gives it a very intimate quality. But the main character never mentions a book she has read, a serious piece of music she likes, or even a good movie that made her cry. Also, since you are literally placed in the main character's head, the author must think like such a person. The author almost pulls it off, except occasionally, there are sentences that come from a well-read Harvard graduate: ""[My son] particularly liked the [story] about the time a man with a gun had robbed the bakery on a Sunday morning when I was sixteen, in the desultory fallow period between 9:00 and 10:30 masses,..."" Desultory fallow period! A Ph.D. in English lit would have choked on those three words strung together."
1,Disappointing,"This was the first book I've read from Oprah's Club. After hearing rave reviews about her choices, this was a total let down, making me wonder if I should even trust her opinion again. The book was full of self pity, predictable. I kept turning the pages waiting for the husband to show up. They should have called it ""sleeping with the enemy""."
1,"Disturbing, depressing and hopeless","I found it horrible to have to read of a struggle, all too real for hundreds of American women alone, and have it turn out so disappointing. You stay with this woman and her son and watch them strive and struggle, and at the end it all seemed fruitless. I was sorry to ever have begun this book."
1,Nothing New,"Quite simply, this is an overated mess of a novel that says nothing new about a serious issue. The characters are thin, particularly poor little generic Robert and his cardboard cutout friends. The biggest mistake is reading to the end expecting something important will happen - it doesn't. I guess it produced some response because I threw it at the wall promptlly after reading the last miserable page."
1,A poorly written disappointment,Very poor use of grammar. Someone should have proofread this thing before publishing. A typical Oprah favorite - each one's more depressing than the last.
2,I couldn't wait for the book to end!,"I picked up this book because I have read Oprah's other picks and have been very pleased, but this one was so so boring...... It took me months to finish this book, I dreaded picking it up but wanted to finish it because i spent the money for it. The characters were boring and the whole narrative was repetitive and read like a diary as another reader said. I just couldn't get into this book at all, the only time it was exciting was when I was getting close to the end knowing that I was almost done! Bad pick Oprah!"
5,it's a great book,We had to do a novel study for my english class. So I decide to do this book not know what it as about.To my surpise it was a good chose. I live that life and know how fran feels. Anna keep the work up.
2,Expected better,The plot was good and the begining was also good but after the first few chapters the story didn't seem so interesting. Personally I expected better.
4,Topical Issue Well Presented,"Ms. Quindlen has a lot of writing talent, and she provides us with a good story of one woman's attempt to escape an abusive husband. While the reader will be quick to sympathize with the mother, there is the ethical question of whether this is the correct action to take when a child is involved. The author doesn't delve into this issue. We are certainly never given reason to believe that the husband, while unquestionably abusive to the wife, would provide any threat to the child; indeed he seems to be a reasonably good parent. The book is well worth reading, and the reader can come to his own conclusions. I would make one comment regarding the protagonist. She essentially seems to be an uninteresting person with no strong interests or hobbies. I can't imagine her picking up this or any other book and reading it. One can have strong empathy for her situation, and wish her well, but she is someone we really don't have much interest in knowing personally."
4,Change the ending,"This was one of the better Oprah selections that I have read. It grabs your interest and you can't put it down. At first you feel sorry for Fran and then you become hopeful that things will turn out well for her and just when it looks like everything is going to work out - there's that ending. It's depressing for Fran to have gone so far and then end up in that situation. It was sad! I passed this book on to some of my coworkers and after quite a bit of discussion, we all agreed - good book, don't like the ending!"
3,Anna has done better,"I love Anna Quindlen's writing, but I do not think that this was her best. It was a very predictable book and didn't have the impact on me that her previous book, ""One True Thing"" did."
3,Not a satisfying read for such a sensitive subject,"I thought that this book was well written on a compelling subject. I did think that Anna Quindlen dwelled on Frannie being an abused woman a bit too much. It seemed to me that I was reminded of this fact at just about every 20 pages or so. I wouldn't say it was truly satisfying reading experience. It wasn't a terrible book, but not a super read. Now, I think that her other novel ""One True Thing"" was a top-notched book and heads above this one. Sorry. I'm still a fan of Ms. Quindlen and I will continue to read all her books."
2,"Worth the time, but still disappointing","Anna Quindlen's Black and Blue has a dramatic, often quoted beginning that pulls you rapidly into the story line---which is dramatic by the nature of the subject matter.It is compelling to experience the fear of domestic abuse (which Quindlen describes well) but the rest of the story line, character development and the ending are disappointing. Oprah's selections are generally excellent at character development and the best have the supporting characters who help the protagonsits's development; this one doesn't.It's still an important read, compelling in it's sujbect matter, but as a total work, it is lacking."
2,Sadly- quite boring,"I can understand that the subject of the book is quite a sensitive one, however I felt the story line was quite slow moving and did not feel the story gripped me until about the last fourth of the book."
3,A well written book,This is a very serious subject and I think the author researched the subject. It has some ups but mostly downs.
3,gripping!,"I have enjoyed Anna Quindlen's non-fiction for years, but prior to this I had not read any of her novels. I was not disappointed. This is the story of Fran, a woman who is escaping her abusive marriage with her young son. Fran, a nurse, feels that her husband's violence has escalated to the point where her life is in danger and because he is a police officer the justice system cannot help her. So instead she changes her name and with the assistance of an underground group, creates a new identity. The book is the best when taking about Fran's old life, her new best friend and new boyfriend, do not have the same feel of reality that the characters from her old life, such as the husband, the mother-in-law, and her sister, do. The back of the paperback edition also gave the reader strong hints as to what the ending would be, taking away some of the novel's supsense. On the whole, I like the book and it is my favorite so far of all of Oprah's selections."
3,This was an excellent story told in a very sloppy manner.,"This was not my first Anna Quindlen novel, but if it had been, it may have been my last. The story was compelling, but the way it was written and (not) edited, was torturous. I wanted to be able to sing it's praises, like other books I've read. However, I can't sing it's praises without also pointing out it's flaws.The grammar and sentence structure was unbelievable for a successful author and a more successful publisher. Random House needs to send the editor of this book back to English class.That said, the story was compelling and I was entranced by the main characters as I should be with a good book."
3,"a good, quick read","it was good, though not as good as i had expected, given all the hype it has received. The story dragged in some places and Fran frustrated me more than once. Nonetheless, i enjoyed it."
2,Glad to see I'm not the only one...,"Apparently I'm not the only one who found this book to be disappointing. I wanted to feel something ... anything ... for the main character; but after all was said and done, after summoning so much inner strength to take such a courageous step, she simply gave up. And I lost respect for her as a character. Everyone else in my book club raved about the book, but I could not get past the lack of character development, the rambling train-of-thought prose, the predictable plot, and the apathetic ending. It seems as if the author also lost interest in the plot, or maybe she too was disappointed with the turn of events her heroine allowed to occur, but whatever the reason, I found the denoument to be empty, shallow, and deflating. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but I don't think I can really recommend it to anyone."
2,"Disappointing book, cardboard characters, predictable","I would never have believed that this book was written by the author of One True Thing. This book does a pretty good job of showing how Fran feels about her husband, but the plot after she leaves him is very weak."
2,THIS BOOK WAS OVER RATED!!!!!!,"I did not enjoy this book. I found it to be uterly boring and slow. It kept taking you back to the same events over and over and I didn't enjoy Anna Quindlens writing. I had to make myself finish this one. After watching the Oprah review on this one I rushed to get it thinking that it was going to be a gripping depiction of spousal abuse, but I was not that touched and I felt like it lacked a lot of feeling. Don't get this one!"
4,"This book was difficult, emotionally, to read","If you are currently in an abusive situation or have suffered one, you may be quite emotionally affected by this book. I went through what the main character, Fran, did, plus some more. That was in the 70's when no help was available....Reading this book brought all sorts of memories back. Quinlan was right on target as far as what goes through one's mind during such an ordeal."
4,It was good!,"I have read every book on the Oprah list except Paradise, and have found all of them too be good. I was expecting more out of this novel than i received. It was a wonderful novel, but could have been more.WHen I began reading it I had a hard time getting into it but once i got in it, I couldn't get out. I felt the pain and abuse that ""Beth,"" had endured. The ending was a little expected and I was able to figure out most of the book before it happened.NOnetheless i recommend the book..."
2,A promising storyline let down by mediocre prose,"In a world where one can be judged by the company she keeps, the author makes the catastrophic blunder of creating an uncaring lead character. With prose resembling a 3rd grader's blackboard scrawlings, Ms Quindlen paints a surpisingly unaffecting, as well as uninspiring landscape into the horrific problem of domestic abuse. Conjuring up dark images, with dry underpinnings, may work for those of the narcisistic pursuasion, but is not the most effective way to develop a heroine. What should be a bitter, albeit important lesson in life's hard knocks, turns into an ordeal for the reader, rivaled only by that of the lead character. Even more disturbing is the macabre humor Ms Quinlan attempts to inject into an otherwise dark story. we see two forces at battle here for control of the novel's direction and unfortuanely the less enlightened side won out."
4,"Eye opener, sad but honest","It felt like it was me going through the whole ordeal of Fran. Very realistic, but I felt it was too quickly condensed towards the end."
4,Opened My Eyes,"This book was great in revealing what it's like to be in a violent and abusive relationship and stuck. Eventually mother and son go into hiding in which I can just feel their pain in having to start over in a place where they have no friends or family; no support and live in fear. How do you begin a new live when your name is not your own and you end up wherever you end up, not necessarily a place of choice? So many times we ask ourselves why does a woman stay and this book really does explain why. I have so much empathy and compassion for women in this position. It boils down to being a no-win situation to some degree. While some people did not like the ending, I did. I thought it was realistic and really does capture what's there at the end of the road."
3,Ehhh,"I'm currently reading this book and I am about 70 pages in and I have to admit, I am not in love with Fran. Sad to say I am finding her kind of dull. While I can appreciate her position and do not approved of abuse, I just do not feel for her the way I was hoping. I had high expectations for this book, but right now, it isn't meeting them. Hopefully once I finish the book I will have a better outlook."
2,Not Quindlen's best,"Having loved everything I've ever read (both essays and fiction) by Anna Quindlen, I eagerly picked up this book. While curiosity about how the story would resolve kept me reading, I was very disappointed. I found the narrative repetitive, and the main character wasn't developed enough for me to care about her (and given her horrific experience, I wanted to care about her). When I read ""One True Thing"", I really felt that I had lived through the experience; this book made me feel that I was eavesdropping on a not-too-interesting conversation. Note: there were so many irritating typos in the first chapter that I was tempted to just put the book down."
4,Suspense Filled,"Excellent read - Anna Quindlen did a great job writing this book!This book will make the hairs on your arms stand up as you read about the life of Fran and her husband Bobby Benedetto. To the outside world, Bobby and Frances seem like the couple that everyone wants to be - a husband that is a New York cop, a wife that is a nurse, and the perfect son, Robert, all living in their nice little house surrounded by friends and family. As you might have guessed, Fran's life was anything but normal with a husband that beats her. Fran's life is anything but perfect and she is too afraid of her own husband to get a divorce with the beatings that she has received in the past - - so she sees her only way out is to leave and start a new life with her son - changing their names and forgetting the other life as much as possible.BUT can you stay hidden forever from your past or will it catch up with you? Pick up the book and see - I promise you will love it and not want to put it down!"
5,A must-read,"First of all, it took me all of two days to read this book, and I'm a slow reader. What I mean is that I couldn't put it down. It made my heart beat faster, filled me with doomed suspense, and I shed many tears. Not only is this a great read, but I think it's an important novel to read, especially for those who don't understand why many women stay in abusive relationships. Told in the first person's view, it really gives you a look inside the mind of an abused wife/mom, and the reader will begin to see why domestic violence so easily continues, and is exactly what it is, a trap and a vicious cycle. However, it also educates us on what a woman has to sacrifice in order to leave it behind. A sad, scary, hopeful, real and wonderful novel."
3,"An okay book, but not brilliant","This book reflects the sad reality of one of the many plagues affecting this world: domestic abuse. Whilst fully sympathising with Frannie, the main character, and abhorring the psychological and physical tortures she went through by the hands of her husband Bobby -including the pain reflected by their son Robert, physically untouched but emotionally damaged- I found the construction of the narrative a bit boring. There's no nicer way to say it, I just didn't think this book was a page-turner.The issue of domestic violence, however, is dealt with realistically and I believe that some parts of this book could be of help for the many ladies out there who suffer every day."
3,"Pot-boiler, but all right","My aunt gave me this book for Christmas (this is what happens when people know you like to read but don't have any idea about your taste, I suppose), and while I am certainly not in the target demographic--I'm 21 years old and male--I was surprised that I didn't hate it.The thing that most impressed me was how nervous and scared I got that Fran's husband would find her. ""Black and Blue"" is a very tense book, and since you're absolutely *sure* he will eventually track her down, you're a bundle of nerves any time she goes out into public.It loses steam pretty seriously toward the end, although the ending itself is less than conventional and redemptive without being treacly.It's an all-right read, but if you're spending more than a week on it, you're doing something wrong."
4,Unforgettable,"I want to begin by advising others to be wary of reading the review from Chicago!! The reviewer felt compelled(?) to reveal the ending of the story!! That said, I found this to be a compelling tale. Quindlen at her best(so far...) Days have passed and I can not seem to shake the story or its characters, both mother and son, from my mind."
3,apathetic...,"There is something formulaic about Black and Blue. Quindlen is clearly a wonderful writer which is evident throughout the text, her mastery of language, her method of allowing the reader to become engrossed in the text, etc. What is lacking here is true psychological depth and insight and a really exciting story. Yes, Quindlen portrays a terrifying story of domestic violence. However, the ending is incredible predictable. And it is very hard for the reader to ever connect with the protagonist of the novel. Quindlen's character examination seems superficial. We don't really get to know her and I'm not convinced that Quindlen really gets to know her. I left the novel saddened by a tale of domestic abuse but apathetic towards both the protagonist and Quindlen."
2,Meh...,"I have to give the author credit, the book was mostly well-written. For not having been abused herself, she did a decent job describing, without too much gruesome detail, the main character's plight. However, the ending of the book left more questions than answers and I was surprised that she ended it when she did. It wasn't as good as it could have been."
4,Powerful emotions portrayed.,"Not only did Quindlan portray powerful emotions about relationships (mother-child, wife-husband, husband-wife, sister-sister, friend-friend) she also stirs those emotions in the reader. This is my first Quindlen read, but it won't be my last. I found the ending believable and real world, not contrived and happy ever after."
4,Engaging Inner Thoughts,"Like ""One True Thing"", Anna Quindlen takes you inside her main character (Fran), revealing in such a real and down-to-earth way her thoughts and reflections on the events that shape her life. This is very engaging and rewarding."
3,"Quidlen's book, One True Thing","This book was very intresting, yet not as good as her book other book, One True Thing. I like Black and Blue and disliked it at the same time. It was as if the book was sucking you in but it really wasn't that intresting. Fran Benedetto, escaped her abusive marriage and started over as Beth Crenshaw, with her son Robert. It was kind of diffcult to follow with all of her flashbacks and what was happening with her life at the present time. What I did enjoy about the book was that Anna Quindlen was painted a very vivid picture of her charaters, I felt as although they are real people."
4,Powerful,This was a wonderful book. I work as a volunteer for a domestic violence and sexual assault program and this book really seems to capture what these women go through. It explains a lot about the choices survivors sometimes make and the feelings they have that people sometimes don't understand.
2,"Boring, sad, anticlimatic.","My most positive comment for the review of this book is that it was no longer than 277 pages. I kept waiting for something to happen and when it did, it was sad. The author jumped back and forth between past and present too much. The ending was sad. Guess that's how life is sometimes...it doesn't always have a tidy way of working out, but I was hoping for more after enduring this boring story. It had trouble holding my attention, but I kept reading waiting for something interesting and maybe even happy to happen. It never did. Sorry if I'm revealing too much of the plot to anyone who hasn't read it, but be warned before investing too much time or money in this book."
3,Just okay.,"I was never really captivated by this book until page 170 or so. That's about when the story really got moving. There was a lot of switching back and forth between memories and present, and the transitions weren't clear. So, I was often confused. In my opinion, the book was just okay. Nothing overly exciting, never got really attached to the characters."
4,Angst in the Face of Abuse,"Sad but accurate portrayal of the inner turmoil of those subjected to abusive partners. Anna Quindlen was able to capture the balance of a woman's hope for the good she knows her husband is capable of and the reality of his dark, brutal side. There are no winners in this tale of love and hate, a sadistic man, a desparate woman faced with few choices, none of which lead to a happy ending. A family torn apart, a child lost between his love of both parents to the point he denies reality and a legal system that doesn't offer support or solutions. An unfortuante clear picture of domestic violence and its tragic impact."
3,Good read,"This was a good read. While I am a single woman who has never experienced an abusive relationship, I empathized with the main character in the book and all she went through while trying to start a new life. Was completely gripped by fear of what would happen from the time her son called her ex to the time she returned and found him in her living room...sheeish! I won't give away too much but I would recommend this book to everyone, if for no other reason than to show people the effects of domestic violence on children."
1,Is plagerism among popular fiction writers acceptable?,"Stephen King did it first: abusive husband, mortal terror, sudden epiphany, protection by a strong group of women, etc, etc. It's called Rose Madder. The detailed beatings are just as graphic/realistic, if that's your cup of tea. As I said, he did it first. He also did it better. However, the day Oprah features Stephen King is the day ALL of our spirits will need healing!! King may venture into the 'woo-woo' territory in Rose Madder, but it's STILL infinitely more entertaining AND thought-provoking than this novel!"
2,Not for parents,"I just finished reading this book last night and went to bed with a huge pit in my stomach. The first section of the book gives you the history of why she needs to get away and how she does it and then it goes into how she manages her new life with her son, but the ending is absolutely horrible. Yes, it some minds it could be called a reality check, but for myself and other parents, it's the unthinkable. I couldn't get this book back to the library fast enough this morning. And I couldn't hug my son enough times before leaving for work. I would not recommend this book."
3,Could have been better; have read worse,"This book has promise and is even readable until you get to the middle of the book. It goes too much into the monotonus detail of a ""everyday life"". It describes the same thing over and over again until you have to put the book down and walk away for a while. The ending is too abrupt as if the author decided the book was too boring for her to even write. Maybe it's my opinion but any decent author knows when a book is finished and she didn't know what a finished book is.But you can also appreciate the realism in this book. How the abusee is still in ""Love"" with the abuser and how the book ended w/o it being all happy like any kind of abuse especially that one is good and will end with total and complete happiness for the child or the parents."
2,Waste of time and money,"Waste of time and moneyThis book was good at first. But had such a bad ending and was so disappointing. I liked Anna Quindlen's other book - Object Lessons. But this one is just plain ridiculous. I don't recommend it at all. I'm tired of getting books recommended by you-know-who's Book Club. Some are good, but most are very disappointing. They're all the same sort of thing."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Unless you are a victim of abuse or expect to be (and who does?) I don't think would be a book you'd like to read. It was informative but I'd call it 'a how to' book not something you'd pick up to read. I wish I had read the reviews first, I wouldn't have bought the book. Just because Oprah selects doesn't mean it will be wonderful, this one wasn't."
1,This book deserves a negative rating!,"This book is like Stephen King's ""Rose Madder"", except poorly written and without most of the excitement. The plot is essentially the same, minus the supernatural elements. I cannot imagine how it made any list, let alone Oprah's, unless no one bothered to finish reading it. It was incredibly predictable, and unimaginably dull. It was hard to even finish. The ending was trite and obviously a ploy to inject some life into a story that was dead from about page 2. It was a total waste of my money. I threw it away, as it was not worthy of shelf space."
3,not what I expected. . .,"I gave this book three stars because it had a great plot, believable characters, and was well-written but it was just. . . boring. I had to push myself to the end. I hate to leave books unfinished, so it took me about a month to get to the end of this one.I had high hopes for it after reading about it, but I was pretty disappointed. Some of the stuff that happens in the book is pointless and doesn't need to be mentioned. It's just not necessary to the plot, yet the reader has to sit through whole pages of pointless and boring rambling. I would often lose my train of thought while reading this book because of the author's tendency to ramble. It was also painfully predictable (except the end- didn't really see that one coming).I guess I would say I do not recommend this. A few times in the book there is a good part or an exciting part that makes you want to keep reading, but these are few and far between. Read only if you have the patience and the time."
2,Well written but lacking.,"I have read about 70% of the Oprah Book Club Books (more of the early choices than the recent ones). While there are some I dearly love, and some I like but am not quite as enthusiastic about, there has never been one that I just couldn't wait to finish--until now. I had to push myself through the last half of this book to finish it. I found myself not caring about a single character in this book, and I quickly tired of Beth's incessant whining.Now before someone reads this and thinks I obviously know nothing about abuse, let me assure you I do. I grew up in a household where my father beat my mother AND my brother. I am no stranger to abuse, and yes it is a horrible horrible thing. But while Ms. Quindlen may have done a fine job at portraying the horrors of abuse, she failed to make me care anything about the people involved or to pull me into their story."
2,BORRRRRING!,"I picked this up for no particular reason. I saw it in the Bestseller section and figured ""How bad can it be?"" Well, pretty bad. Perhaps ""bad"" isn't the correct term, since the author writes fairly well. It's just that the story was so slow I felt like I was waiting for something, ANYTHING to happen to keep me going. Reading shouldn't involve that much work. I liked the characters a lot, but I need more action."
3,Haunting,"I read this book a couple of years ago. As a victim of domestic violence, I could really identify with the horror of her life. However, and I'm about to give the ending away so please stop reading my review now if you haven't read the book yet-if I remember correctly, her husband found her when her son called him (caller ID?). HELLO?!?! Wouldn't she or the people who were helping her have figured out that he would easily be able to find her??????? Also, I found it disturbing that in the end she ""settled"" for someone she wasn't really in love with."
3,"Intriguing, but mediocre...","The beginning of the book is intriguing because of the way Anna Quinland describes the scenerio. As the story progresses, Fran Benedetto recalls the abuse she has encountered from her husband, who is a policeman. She escapes from her husband by relocating to Florida with the help of an agency. The story drags a little because your waiting for the moment in which her husband is going to find her."
1,"Boring, slow, predictable, unrealistic","Don't buy this book. It took me forever to finish because I didn't care how it ended. You don't feel for the characters. It's so flat and dry. It's so boring, I can't even find words to explain how boring. I was so happy to finish this book, so I could start reading a real story."
2,Another typical Oprah pick,"More abuse, more difficult situations, more broken families, I think the bookclub should move on. Enough of these depressing stories that don't happen to a majority of the readers...let's read something nice for a change!"
2,A disappointment.,"This seemed oh so shallow and without much substance. The topic and story line was timely, but not very original. Same old, same old.sspring@means.net"
4,"GREAT BOOK, A MUST READ","Black and Blue, by Anna Quindlen, is well written, has an active and enticing plot, and most of all, allows the reader into the main character's innermost thought and secrets through wonderful chacter development. Within the first 20 pages of Black and Blue the reader finds herself not only sympathizing with the protagonist, Fran Benedetto, but already hating her ill-tempered husband, Bobby as well. The text keeps the reader feeling as though they are watching a good horror movie-- always wondering when the killer will come back. Although at times I found the repeated flashbacks of stories of the dysfunction Fran and her husband went through a little redundant at the middle of the book, I was completely jolted out of my seat through the last 50 pages. Black and Blue makes me want to read more of Quindlen. Her character development and mood setting abilities are out of this world. Although at times I felt this book was little longer than necessary, I give it 4 stars."
2,I just don't get what all the fuss is about?!?,"It took me several months to read this book! I just found it very easy to put down and dreaded picking it back up again. I found myself noticing the writing and the style more than the story. I guess it just never ""hooked"" me. It is interesting because I love Alice Hoffman and Anne Rivers Siddons--and their styles have some similarities, but I just don't get why so many people raved about this....."
4,I AM WISHING FOR THE SEQUEL...,"I thought that this book was good enough to read in 3 days, but when I got to the last few pages, I was greatly disappointed. I wish that there was a sequel because Anna Quindlen left us all in a bad spot. She needs to continue with the story of ""Beth Crenshaw"" and include Robert."
3,Bait and switch?,"I was swept up by this woman's courage and determination to find a way out of a seemingly hopeless situation, and I found the book a real page-turner. But as I read on, I started feeling less comfortable with her and her obsession with her son Robert. It began to seem she'd substituted her obession with her abusive husband to an obsession with her son. After gaining my sympathy throughout the whole book and underlining it with her description of the conversation with her mother-in-law where the women insists blindly that her son is a good man and ""nobody can tell me different"", sending shivers down my back, Frannie herself says: ""I don't give a damn about her, about her bruises and even her broken bones...I love my boy. I always have. I always will."" All of the sudden there was no difference between Fran and Ann Benedetto? That's cheating."
2,Cut out the middle.,"This book starts and ends well, but if you take out the entire middle of the book, I could have saved a weeks worth of my life."
1,black and blue,"This book, which started with a good idea, was so boring and repetitive that I couldn't finish it. I didn't care that her husband beat her and really, she deserved it for being so dull."
3,Not up to par,"Black and Blue, while a fast read, goes on too much. Quindlen practically hits the reader oever the head with the fact that Frannie is an abused woman. Subtlety is lost--this book can't compare to One True Thing, her previous novel. She defines her character by the abuse she has suffered, and if we can't gather this up for ourselves, she makes sure to tell us every five pages what we should be thinking. Frannie's character simply exists because she has been abused--that's all Quindlen gives the reader. What reading Black and Blue did for me was reinforce my belief that the best story about an abused woman is Roddy Dyole's The Woman Who Walked into Doors--Doyle gives the reader a character to sympathize with, not a situation. I was terribly disappointed with this book."
3,Mixed Review,I found the book very good in some parts. But it just seemed to drag on. I got tired of it. I felt that she was encourgeing abuse by staying in an abusive relationship.
2,Black and Blue Made Me Blue Too,"As painful as being beaten by your husband must be, reading this book about it hurt too. Anna Quindlan harps on and on about the same issues over and over and over again. The woman's new life and the life that she subjects her poor son too are so depressing and bleak that it's hard to see the light. I felt like I was reading a documentary rather than a novel. If the author wanted to get a point across she should have done so through a voice that is less stuck in the past, less self-absorbed, less pathetic really. Finishing this book made me feel black and blue. Leave this one on the shelf."
5,One of the best books I have read in a long time.,It's not often that I find a book I can hardly put down and this is one of them. It was extremely gripping and captured your attention 100%
2,Let Down,"I just finished Black and Blue... I am the type of person that if I really like a book, I can read it over and over again... But I won't be reading this one again.Mainly, I had a hard time with the language. She took the Lord's name in vain at least every other page, if not more. It was quite annoying and distracting, as I tried to avoid reading those parts... Also, the author went back and forth between the past and the present so much, that sometimes it took a few sentences before I realized it was a memory, and not the present.BUT... I still couldn't put the book down. I had to know what was going to happen to Fran, Robert, and Bobby.As a mom... I didn't like the ending."
1,Probably One of the Most Depressing Books I've Read,"Thankfully, this book is short. If you are interested in battered women, divorce and upheaval, then this is the book for you. I found the book depressing and sort of going no where. This lady never seems to get herself together and is constantly running from something. Maybe I just didn't get it, but maybe you won't either."
2,Black and Blue,"To predictable and very anti-climatic. The charactars are not that interesting and very ""fit the moldish."" The stereotypical wife-beater mold was nothing new."
1,Such a terrible book!!,"If I could give this book a negative rating, I would give -10. I think ""Black and Blue"" might be the most terriblebook I have read in several years. I expected so much that I read till the end.(Kudo to my patience!!)OMG. What a disappointing ending!! What was the author thinking? Were you drunk, Anna Quindlen?You know how excited I was when I picked up your book? I regret reading your book.I really don't understand you. with your weak character development, ridiculous ending, and incohesive plot, Youturned a grand topic- domestic violence/abuse into a boring, predictable disaster.Ladies and gentlemen (Boys and girls) Don't waste your precious time in this book. If you are a person with limitedpatience and some anger issue, don't even look at this book. You might end up punching your wall. I mean it."
4,I couldn't put this book down,"Although I don't rate this book as highly as Quindlen's ""One True Thing,"" I found it impossible to put down, and it haunted me between reading sessions. The whole time I was reading it, I was tense with the inevitability of Bobby's discovery of Fran, and almost sick with fear for her. I found the ending inexorably sad but hopeful.I was, however, troubled by all the typos in the paperback, especially since Quindlen is a former journalist. I'm sure she must have been disappointed in her editors.I also thought she could have done more to explain Bobby's motivation, rather than just making him a sexy but evil character. Still, I recommend the book highly, and look forward to Quindlen's next effort."
3,"Great Beginning, Horrible ending","This book had a rip roaring start but soon slowed down to almost a snails pace, after the first hundred pages the characters become less and less interesting as the story becomes increasingly boring. The end is a travesty which knocks the book down to the dreariest book of the 90's."
3,Average,"I found this to be an average book. I don't think it is worth all the rave reviews it has gotten, but it doesn't deserve to be slammed either. I think it had a lot of potential, but it was lacking. It was a page-turner, only because I was waiting for the inevitable. Then when it happened, I found it to be rather anticlimactic. While I certainly felt bad for the characters, I can't say that I really cared about them. On the positive side, the high level of detail was vivid to the point of being disturbing. There were a lot of parts that were very powerful and thought provoking.Although this has nothing to do with the author, I was bothered by the volume of typos in it."
2,Not worth it-probably will become a bad movie on Lifetime,"What a disappointment! Both this and ""The Deep End of the Ocean"" just rehash old stories. Worse, there is no unique point of view, no stellar writing, or anything to hold the readers attention. It's NOT the WORST book ever written, but its hardly worth the effort. The message is important, but the plot leaves much to be desired."
3,An important book,"I did not find myself compelled through the book and somehow felt distanced from the story. I believe it is an important book, but certainly one I would not read in one sitting."
3,Challenging Reality,"I absolutely loved One True Thing by Anna Quindlen--so I was excited to read another book by her. The story told about domestic violence is an important one to tell. There is some much complexity to the drama and pyschology of those in this type of relationship. I believe Ms. Quindlen did justice to this complexity. I didn't like the fact that resolution came through another male--a somewhat of heroic character. Is it possible for female protagonists to create successful outcomes without the need for a male ""savior?"" I'd like an author to tell a story with a happy ending--with the female protagonist being the ""hero."""
4,Fiction or Real Life?,"I found this novel to smack heavily of realism and it kept me coming back for more. I hardly put it down while I was reading it. Anna Quindlen's novel of this abused woman and her struggles to start a new life seemed all too real to me and hit all too close to home with her vivid descriptions of the suffering Fran Benedetto endured at the hands of her policeman husband. I've seen too many of my friends go through some of these same situations not to recognize how closely art imitates life in this novel. Ms. Quindlen has brought her characters to life for me with her colorful descriptions of their struggles to over come all the adversities they've faced through their life. I never felt as though her characters couldn't have been real people that I might come in contact with everyday. I find myself wanted to read more of her work to see if I would enjoy them half as much as I enjoyed reading ""Black and Blue"". I would highly recommend this novel to anyone."
1,I know I should give this a positive review .. but ...,"give me a break, what a short sighted and basically unlikable protaganist. I mean this girl, yes she may have suffered an abusive relationship, but, she looks down on the people that want to help her AND worst of all really expresses a doubt that when her son grows up and beats his wife, well, she won't really care since it's been done to her.Some people interpret this as tragic, I interpret this as stupid, shallow and with no redeeming grace. I mean why write about her 'that bites the hand' that feeds her mentality... I have never read an Oprah's book club selection before ... well ... nuff said !"
1,I HATED this book!!!,"What a lousy read! I expected so much from it; I'm a regular IMUS listener --- and for some unknown reason, he promoted the hell out of it. Well, it was a terrible book. I couldn't wait for it to end. Agony! The book is a feminist take on a tragic topic. Liberal themes abound. But beyond all else, it is terribly written! Quindlen may have been a fine newspaper writer --- may still be --- but I for one will NEVER read her!"
2,"Too long, too long",I listened to the audio tape of this book. The reader was excellent (one of the 2 stars is for her) but this book was filled with cliches in word and plot.
4,"Gripping, troubling","I really enjoyed reading this book... Having been in a mildly abusive relationship in college, I understood exactly why Fran was afraid to leave, and the power that Bobby had to constantly frighten her into staying. Anna Quindlen's grasp on the dichotomy of Fran's weakness and her eventual strength were impressive. I felt pain with her pain, victory with her victory, and fear with her fear. I read the book this past weekend, and have already given it to a friend to read. Like most of the people below, I feel like the last chapters left some loose ends, but isn't that the way life realistically ends up? A good read, and I highly recommend it, though it won't leave you skipping for joy... It actually makes me want to go to our local battered women's shelter and try to help."
5,All women owe it to themselves to read this book,"I don't know how Anna Quindlen obtained her research - but she pulled out all the stops. Her main character, Fran, spoke so candidly about her ambiguous feelings toward her husband and marriage that I felt like she was directing it to me. Excellent book about a touchy subject."
4,Moving and Though-provoking,"The female lead in the book is tortured by her life. After spending years with an abusive husband she tries to take her destiny in her hands. For some time it seems to work, but suddenly everything changes. This book will cause you to feel for this poor-soul of a woman who just can't seem to have things that every human being should be allowed to have. Especialy peace!!"
4,"Quindlen proves aftermath of abuse no bed of roses, either","The fascinating part of this book to me was Quindlen's study of the aftermath of Fran leaving Bobby. Many of us have heard, seen, or read about the kind of torture she absorbed at her husband's hand, but fewer of us have read such a convincing story of what happens next. It is not a rose garden or an easy path to have chosen, at least for Fran, who continues to feel stalked and who cannot quite emerge as a person because Bobby is out there just waiting to come back to destroy her. And yet, given the opportunity to pummel her once again or kill her, he chooses instead the psychological abuse of taking her son away and leaving Fran forever his prisoner. Quindlen's writing is pure poetry, real, emotionally charged, and righteous."
4,"Troubling topic, familiar voice","Anna Quindlen tackles the subject of domestic violence with sensitivity and intelligence. Couple this with her Pulitzer Prize winning style and you have a book that grabs you and pulls you into the maelstrom that is Fran Benedetto's life. For the reader who is uneducated in the area of domestic violence, the character of Fran brings to life the ambivalent emotions that beset abuse victims. Minor problems that detract somewhat from the book's impact are a confusing time-line of events and the fact that the wonderful visual imagery that Quindlen creates serves more to embellish the setting for a particular scene than to strengthen its emotional value."
3,Too depressing for me...,"In general, this book was ok. However, to me it seemed like whenever a new topic was brought up in the plot, it was suddenly taken back to the graphically worded beatings of the main character over and over again!I feel the same information was repeated frequently throughout the read.I would recommend this book to someone who has been in an abusive relationship or can relate to the issue, otherwise, it is quite the downer."
3,Not too great,I guess it was OK. I have always enjoyed her work and wanted more from this book. It was too predictable and didn't keep to the story. I wanted to be kept in suspense and I wasn't. It wasn't all Oprah said it would be.
3,Sporadically credible,"The only authenticity apparent in this sad novel is the range of emotions experienced by Fran. The emotions and indecision experienced by her are very close to those experienced by battered women. The rest of the novel (save the ending) seems to be a battered woman's fantasy getaway, with no bills, an immediate job, and a sweet guy just yearning to be husband to her and father to her son....and he's single. A bit contrived, but it does accurately portray, at times, the difficulty faced when deciding to leave an abusive realtioship."
4,...and YOU are there...,"This book begins quickly and keeps up the pace. I liked the believability of the characters and how I myself felt able to be put into the situation of the main character. Yes, it has some predictability, but not entirely. The title alone is captivating, haunting, and right on. I'll read more from this author."
2,"Predictable,after initial stirring opening book becomes dull","Book grabs reader in the beginning as mother and son go into a sort of ""witness protection program for abused wives."" However, the story then gets duller and duller and more or less predictable, with a contrived ending to gain reader's sympathy."
4,Still crying!,"Black and Blue had the most profound affect on me. I'm still crying for this woman. All the abuse she took for years, her effort to escape it, and then the very bad hand she was dealt in the end. As bad at is was, it could be worse. Another book along these lines that really upset me too is HINDSIGHT by Elizabeth Rae Monroe."
5,Rebuttal to Christine H. Review,"Black and Blue is one of the best audio books I have ever listened to. I am wondering if Christine H. read the same book. I do not think that abuse of women fits any mold. Everyones situation is different. Quindlens book transports you into Franny's world. You feel her fear, her pain, and the fragmentation of her self esteem. It is a riveting book that you can't put down. The kind of book that I am always searching for. I would be interested to know the kinds of books that Christine H. finds exciting after reading her negative review of this fine novel. Steeny Betker"
5,"Heart-breaking, a tear-jerking book","This story about a woman absconding with her son from her husband who was ever so brutal and would cruelly beat her until she was battered and mentally broken, portrayed a sense of family life of a different kind, something that we not see every day. Especially till the end, you would find the pain of her living without her son, Robert, who was later unfairly taken away from her for the first time, when she had just finally settled a new life, really shattering and devastating to a woman's life. The story ended off with a rhetorical ""I don't know"", that was ever so distant and you could hear the echoes and reverberations in your heart, haunting you.. A must read for all, a credible Oprah book!"
2,Predictable,"Once again I have fallen prey to a book recommended by Oprah. This book was a good case for practicing speed reading. Hardley any tension, very predicable. On this subject ""Burning Bed"" was a vastly better book. This is a situation I have been in and never would bemoan the lack of my house and it's so called ""safe"" surronding for another life away from the pain and torment. Just a silly book to waste time with."
2,Disappointed by poor editing,Perhaps I would have appreciated BLACK AND BLUE by Anna Quindlen had I not been so distracted throughout the reading by grammatical errors and poor spelling. (There are some errors that Spell Check does not catch!) Is this what happens when the publisher has to rush to reach an Oprah deadline?
2,Rose Madder Sans Supernatural,A disappointing introspective from an abused spouse. Skimmed too much of the surface.
2,Too predictable -- little suspense,"The characters are very predictable. The good guys are nice and the bad ones, nice on outside but mean underneath. Not enough depth of character for Robert the son caught in the middle. I read a book a week mostly best sellers but found this one unexciting compared to most others."
4,It won't go away just because it's uncomfortable!,"I am a police officer myself and I know for a fact that it happens this way. This was a powerful example, and I shudder to imagine a wife of one of my fellow officers coming to me with this. If I was friends with him, I probably wouldn't believe it at first either. I was impressed by the character development in that it was accomplished through dialog and thought rather than dry adjectives. Anyone who was distracted by typos, I suppose, must not be ""getting"" the gist of the words. I only hope that more people in general can read and undersatnd. I am recommending this book to anyone with the slightest hint of compassion!!"
2,A Bland Read,"After reading One True Thing by Anna Q., I was pleased to purchase Black and Blue. However, after reading the book, I was left with a feeling of hopelessness and slight boredom. The plot rambles on, never taking the characters or the readers anywhere of real importance. I admit my expectations were high because I like Quindlen's work, but truly, this one can stay on the shelf."
5,Wondering,"Anna Quidlen's novel on abuse raises disturbing questions and leaves the reader with even more disturbing answers. The main character, a long abused wife and mother, flees with her adolescent son in the hopes of putting her past behind her.I found myself wondering if that is every really possible. The conclusion of the novel left me feeling jaded. As a society, we push the main character into her decision, which we claim is the absolute correct one, and what happens? Her world destructs.Ms. Quindlen did a magnificent job keeping us in touch with the hurt and pain that comes with living with an abusive spouse, and the anguish and grief that comes with leaving one. Reading Black and Blue was truly an emotionally educating experience."
3,Good enough to read (once),This book started out as a great read but somewhere in the middle became boring and slow at times. It was a good story and once I made it through the parts that dragged it was enjoyable to read.The ending did seem very abrupt and as others have said it did lack closure. I guess the reason I'm OK with that in this case is that it makes the book more real to me without the fake happy all-is-well ending.It ended up being a decent read but for me was not the kind of book that grabs you and keeps you turning the pages.
4,Pretty Good,"I'm still seeking that perfect novel I guess. This one was pretty good. The topic was realistic and gripping. The dilemmas rang true. The one and only problem I had was that the voice of the main character, Fran Benedetto, did not sound like a Fran, but like an Anna... Anna Quindlen. It seems to be tough for authors to give their characters voices that sound different from their own. I continue to seek this out in fiction. Maybe this is why first person is not the preferred form for fiction."
5,This is a Must Read!!!,"Black and Blue by Anna Quindlen is a very heartwrenching story.The sad thing is that it could often be true.Fran Benedetto is a nurse and the wife of Bobby Benedetto, apolice detective and a wife beater. Finally, having had enough of it she takes her child and leaves with the help of a protection agency. In this new town, which is far, far away, shenow becomes Beth Crenshaw. She's given a whole new life to lead.This was a very good book. Although I wish the ending had been a little happier. I truly liked this book and give it five stars:)"
2,Typical Anna Quindlen book,"I've read most of Quindlen's book and have been a little disappointed every time. This was no acception. The characters are your typical stereotypes of Italian/Irish/Catholic New Yorkers, the circumstances are uncreative, and the story lines tend to drag on as you suffer through constant repition of the character's thoughts over and over again. As several people have already mentioned, the editing was quite poor in this one."
4,A story about a woman who runs from her abusive husband.,"This book was interesting and suspenseful in a number of ways: It had a catch 22 situation. She didn't want to stay because he was abusing her and she also wanted to protect her son. She was fearful of leaving because she might be killed. Her husband was a cop, therefore she couldn't get help from a cop."
1,Black and Blue missed it's mark!,"Having just finished reading Black and Blue, I can tell you in all honesty I will never pick up this book again. Anna Quindlen showed lack of depth in character development. I felt constandly bombarded with her desire to champion every known cause to man. Check out a book by Stephen King called Rose Madder. Rose fled from an abusive husband who just so happened to be a police officer!"
1,Very very boring,"This book makes for a boring read. It took me three long months to finish reading it. It reads like a persons diary. The main character, Fran Bendetto, gets out of bed and goes to the beauty parlor. Next day, she takes her son grocery shopping, next day they go on a picnic. When will it end? Sorry, this is a thumbs down....way down."
2,A Lifetime Movie in book form,"Fran Benedetto has been married to a NYC cop for many years. Together they have a son together. And that's the only reason she claims she stays with her husband Bobby...because he beats her horribly. After one beating, she has decided she has had enough and with the help of a woman she met at her nursing job, she flees to Florida with her ten year old. She tries to start a new life, but she's always waiting for Bobby to find her. And that's what kept me reading. It wasn't exactly a great work of literature or anything, but it was a quick disposable read touching on a serious topic."
4,A Good Book!,"""Black & Blue"" was a good novel. It was especially easy to read & it definitely flowed. I did enjoy it,but somehow, it didn't become one of my favorites.The story was great, with such a sad ending and even though its not one of my favorites, I would recommend it, because it seems like a novel that anyone would like, it's easy to like, but for me, it just didn't have that something, to make it WONDERFUL. But read it, you'll have fun."
3,Too predictable,"This book was a fast, easy read, perfect for the beach. However, I found it very predictable. Nothing new, no new insights into the horror of domestic abuse. Most of it read like a made for TV movie to me. I felt tremendous sympathy for Fran and her failed dreams of a happy marriage, but I knew within the first 20 pages what was going to happen. Not a bad book at all, but not the novel the reviews have made it out to be."
3,Same Old Same Old,"I wasn't wowed. It was well-written but, quite frankly, boring and predictable. It moved a bit slow in parts."
2,typos too distracting,"Have to admit that I'm probably missing out on a great read, but I'm only on page 33 and have come across 3 major ""typos"" and/or spelling errors which are very distracting. Example : ""his apple slices on a plate, his mine (??) in a glass, .."" (pg 10), ""Where are we going, Mom?"" he wined (??) (pg. 11), ""so that Robert with (??) either upstairs or down on the front steps"" (pg 33). Who was Ms. Quindlen's editor?? Sorry, I'm returning this book."
3,Thought provoking but not a page turner.,"This book was interesting in the sense that you can experience the tragedy that abuse plays in the lives of families. I didn't find it a book that I was totally wrapped up in. Found it hard to get emotionally attached to the characters. It was an eye opener in the challenges that a woman faces when she is forced to leave and ""escape"" her own husband."
4,A very compelling read. You feel her tension awaiting the ex,This was one of those books I picked up and couldn't put down. I am a police reporter and often hear the stories of wives who are tormented by their cop husbands. I felt like the story was genuine and the tension was palpable as she waited for her husband to find her. This guy exists. I've seen them. And I surprised myself by weeping through the last 10 or so pages.
2,absolutely mediocre,This book was predictable from the very beginnning. It reminded me of a 'made for TV movie'. The subject matter was intriguing but the plot was far too predictable and therefore difficult to plod through. The saving grace was the character's honesty about the emotions she felt about her husband and child.
4,WOW! Sure makes a woman think.,Quindlen shows what it is like to be a battered woman with very few options and just how scary it is. Very good read and hard to put down. But it's not a feel good book -- it's an eye opener for some and reality for others.
4,Ok gun,"This is a great gun if you are careful with it. mine is partially broken but still works and ive had it for about a year. The scope sucks, its mostly for show. The handle on mine broke very easily. The mag is very small and occasionaly lets bbs out. The battery is a pain. This gun has great power and accuracymy friend is scared of it even tho it is a bit broken. Great gun very fragile"
1,I LOVE CURRY,ok so i love curry a ton and the curry itself is amazing outside of looking like green baby puke. Its just its not worth the price to order it online.
3,expensive but need it,"I love curry, kids love it too. I like this brand, I get the one without MSG, only wish it was bigger. For such a small batch, it's expensive. If you can get it at your local grocery store, I recommend that route.LOVE S&B;!"
4,This IS Ed Pettersen!!!,"For the person who left the other review...this CD IS by Ed Pettersen.Not the ""Americana"" artist you mentioned, but by a talented contemporaryChristian singer/songwriter who's music is winning hearts.You made it sound like you were blaming him for having the same name...how juvenile. More than one person can be named Ed Pettersen."
3,Mis-matched components,"This Pyle marine amp is very impressively built but is badly let down by the very sub-standard mic that is shipped with it. Also, when connected to the supplied iPod/iPhone input it frequently over-loads or over-heats."
1,PYLE of S***!!!!!!,"This is the second set of PYLE HYDRA MARINE AMP/PA Radio I purchased with same LAME results!!!! DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS SYSTEM! It is not worth the time or money. It seems like these systems are so poorly made that even a professional installer can;t make it work (for long). Save your money, buy a system with integrity like Motorola."
4,Mr.,I a fair pot for the money....my first one only lasted 6 months due to the spicket handle breaking.
1,"Worked well, until it broke 5 months later. 12 month warranty does not cover shipping - very expensive. West Bend is better.","It worked quite well for about 5 months (intermittent use, not 24/7), then it started leaking and the tap broke off. Company rep was very nice, but stated that 12 month warranty only covers replacement not shipping charges. Because of the weight, shipping back and forth at my expense makes no sense. I am going with a different brand this time: for the amount of money I would spend on shipping, just buy a different coffeemaker from another brand."
4,"Dex 4 Glucose Tablets, Raspberry - 50 ea","These tablets do exactly what they claim to do. In addition, they are very tasty and delicious. This is not the first time that I've used them. I have no complaints, and would highly recommend you try them if you have explored others brands that were not up to your expectation.I believe this brand is bit expensive but, they work better than the cheaper ones."
1,ow!,"I have long thick hair. This brush actually hurts to use. It scratched my scalp. My labrador wanted me to try it on her and when I did she ran out of the bathroom--she usually loves to be brushed with my brush. Oh, and I can't return it. The company doesn't take brushes (or anything else really) back and so I'm stuck with it. It's in the trash."
5,For Morrow Fans:,You have to love Morrows writing.... This was a really great book...It was a little different than say 'Towing Jehovah' but it was recognizably 'Morrow'... Bern From Florida
4,Another good one from Morrow,"This is another good novel from Morrow. His use of Principia as a narrator is interesting and works well. The novel is probably a bit longer than it needs to be. The number of allusions to other sources is rather large and no doubt I didn't catch them all. It is important to read the book as an allegory and read its characters and their actions as allegorical.Now one might expect Morrow to trash superstition and religion and bow down to the emergence of the scientific worldview. Not so. Various characters of scientific history are made to look vain and distracted. I think the allegory revolves around the figures not understand the significance of their work. They, like us, are distracted by the trivialities of the present and they don't realize their longtime significance. While this sounds dry, Morrow does this by having the characters bounce off of each other in great humor.Recommended..."
4,"I loved ""The Next Step"" the first time I heard it.",I really liked the CD single by Jim and his video on CMT. I was reallly hoping that he would have released an album or will be doing so soon.
4,Essential,"I was so suprised when I listened to this. I was shocked at the mucical quality of the songs. Asided from the awful graphics and minimal notes, this fills a major hole in my collection. George's music is suprisingly interesting. All most all of his big hits are included, the rest are in the Bear Family Boxed set. If you have no George CD's in your collection, this will more than fill the void. Then you can move on to other essentials."
4,Best stuff EVER!,I use this product daily! Love everything about it! It is more expensive to buy in a salon. Amazon has been the cheapest place to buy it through.
4,K Cook,This is a great product to use to enhance your haircut. it makes all of the layers of your hair be shown. Great Control.
5,Great for fine or thin hair,"The best way to use this is by placing a very small amount on your middle fingertip. About the size of a pencil eraser for short hair. Then rub your finger tips together so the product is on all finger tips, then pat your finger tips together. You'll see threads or strings as the product blends. At this point you can rub it into your hair as you wish. Be careful because if you use too much your hair will look greasy. I have very fine hair. So fine that I require a spritz of hairspray before using my curing iron or my hair falls out of the iron. And now that I'm older, my hair is thin as well. This product lifts my hair and it appears very full. Once I'm finished lifting my hair, I spritz again with hairspray and it stays all day. I must say again that too much texture twist is bad. Your hair will look greasy."
4,Best product for flexible hold,"I have wavy hair that just looks stupid if I use gel or other stiff product. Since Sebastian Threads was discontinued, this is my go to product. I can be beautifully wavy or stick straight with this product. Nice lasting moveable hold. Product seems to last for months too. Overall a great product that lasts."
2,Doesn't do a thing for my hair :(,I have flat hair and I put this on dry and it doesn't do a thing. I can't even tell anything is in my hair. It's still limp. I put a quarter size dollop so I know it's not me. I guess this just isn't for my hair. I use other products that give me way more volumne then this. Not worth the $20
5,Waiting on arrival of the new Slim & Supreme Angels DVD,"Tell it like it is. I'm 57 years old (white) and grew up on Black Gospel with my grandfather in the fields of South Carolina. This has to be the best DVD in my collection. When I listen and watch, it's heartwarming to know that Willie is still blessing through God's music from the grave. The quality is EXCELLENT. Willie knows the Bible and what he's singing about. I would recommend that somehow you could make sure buyers know this is the live performance of GOSPEL LEDGENDS IN JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI. I searched all the cuts on You Tube looking for every song Willie did in the silver suit and hoped that was what I was ordering. And it was. I love it. Play it everyday. Everyone who loves gospel needs this DVD."
1,Not as Pictured,"This truly is a mini wagon and it doesn't look anything like the photo. The dimensions aren't accurate - it's only about 6 inches long - NOT 16 inches. It can't be pulled around by a child. ""America's Promise"" - not ""Radio Flyer"" is printed on the side."
5,RB,"This wagon arrived promptly (3 days after ordering) and was EXACTLY what I'd expected. I don't know what the other purchasers had in mind, but clearly they did not read the description accurately. Thank you to the seller who also contacted me prior to shipping to make sure I understood my purchase. And finally, my 2 year old son LOVES this wagon, especially because it fits in his pocket!"
1,DISAPPOINTED,When browsing for Radio Flyer Little Red Wagons - this picture appeared.... I was pleased... I wanted these for my daughters bridal shower theme..... I received the wagons was very excited because the shipment box clearly states Radio Flyer with the logo.... then to open the package and see America's Promise.... What is up with this??? Emailed the contact and will waiting for response.... INITIAL DISAPPOINTMENT.....
5,luv luv luvee dub dub,"Bought this baby for my other baby, Zildjian 21"" ride, and it holds up pretty good. So glad I spent the extra money for this one instead of the cheaper model."
2,Too much sales not enough info,"We got wake boards and my kids want to know how to use them. We know nothing about the sport.Watched this DVD - and there are some good parts for the beginner but most of this video was not really valid for us. Only about 5 min's of video were worth watching, the rest was a lot of filler and presented information out of order the way a beginner would want to watch it.With that said - I could not find a better video to buy. There is some value in this DVD, but not worth the price."
5,Love It,I bought this stethoscope a while ago. As an EMT I used and abused it in the field for a while. I love this thing. I can hear great through it and it is very durable. Its a great deal for the price. I would definatly recommend this product
4,buying this as a gag gift,"for a co-worker who dresses like she's about to go into surgery. As the surgeon, I might add. :)"
1,Useless.,Can't hear well. Got one from my school's stethoscope ceremony...all it's good for is display.
5,new technology wins,i've been holding out from buying a laser level hoping for something like this. i've used the PLS5 and PLS3 and like them but the annoying thing was always moving the little point of a laser to where you need it. I use laser levels mostly to level ceilings and floors in my remodeling job. now this chore has gone from a two to a one person job as i don't have to have anyone manning the level to move the one point around.love it!!
4,PLS Laser Review,"I have used the PLS180 to level ceilings and plumb interior walls to a distance of roughly 50 feet. It's compact size and the strength of the laser line (ability to readily see it) over that distance is a plus. Control of the unit is straightforward, using buttons to cycle through the various functions."
5,Awesome New Design,"This little level works great! The new design allows for a whole room to be reached by one placement of the PLS180 in a corner. I've used other laser levels before, and this one is by far the best. This is the next best thing compared to a rotating beam laser. And more functional than a rotating laser (more uses). The beam is very bright, and it was very accurate too. Well worth the price, wich seems too low for the quality and degree of coverage."
1,Ed Klein isn't even capable of defending his book -- how can the right-wing,"As with DBS (previous reviewer), I, too, am currently listening to Ed Klein on the Al Franken show, and it TRULY IS SAD! Joe Conason (who wrote ""The Hunting of the President"" -- which is a GREAT book BTW) is also on the show confronting Ed about his poor journalistic integrity. With every irrefutable fact thrown at Ed which contradicts his book, he has no defense except to say that he must have made a mistake or that he can't recall the source.You know it's bad when even the right-wing columnists out there are condemning this thing. It's pathetic."
1,Piece of garbage,"Should be given a negative rating. Tabloid newspapers have more accuracy than this book. Mr Klein didn't even research his resources by getting names wrong and mispelling others. He seems to be Mrs. Clinton's mind reader. In an interview on the radio, he offers apologies for misleading sentences and taking things out of context just so he could put money in his pocket for this filth. Time and money are better spent on anything other than this book."
1,"Innuendo, rumor, and gossip","Klein's book is a disappointing collection of half-truths and rumors that have been debunked by previous writers. The only ""entertainment"" from his ""biography"" is the shock value, since there's little real truth.NOTE FOR OTHER ONLINE REVIEWERS: Amazon will remove any review that contains vulgar or profane language or consists of personal attacks on other reviewers. You are writing a review, not a personal message to the public. Please be professional."
1,So what!,"Any book discouraging uninformed voters to vote against Hillary is worthy of ink.Although, I believe it is mostly speculative.So what!It is about time the left gets a taste of their own medicine.Two things in the book that I agree with:1. Hillary is power hungry.2. Hillary is transforming herself into a centrist.If the reader believes nothing else but these two points it was worth the speculative ink.I gave it one star so the lefties will read it! Kiss Kiss! Liberals."
1,Writer obviously not a right-winger,"Ihave not read this book, but I have read about the author. His liberal credentials are impecable.Therefore, any reviewer who slams this book as a ""right wing conspiracy"" product,automatically renders his review as emotional fantasy, not reality. I suggest everyone disregard this kind of criticism and read pro/con reviews based on the book itself and its facts."
5,"The Truth About Hillary: What she knew, . . .","Good GOD help us all if this lady gets the Demo nod to run for Prez in 2008!A book well done, insightful, straight forward by an author without an ax to grind.Highly recommended reading. You won't put it down . . . guaranteed!"
1,Trash for Cash,"If Ed Klein's sourcing in this book was professional, he could put himself in Kitty Kelley's league. But since he hasn't managed to meet even the weakest journalistic standards of two verifiable sources (Kelley uses three), the title of this review says it all. You've heard it all, seen it all and read it all about Hillary Clinton before.Yes, she's ambitious. Sure, she can be ruthless. You bet, she has gall! These are all qualities that are admired in men and villifed in women. If you want to read criticism of Hillary Clinton, at least get it from Peggy Noonan's books, or Barbara Olson's books. Surely, Ann Coulter will be coming out with something before 2008. But a man's criticism of Hillary should never be taken seriously."
1,Republican Smear Machine Strikes Again,"Just when I thought they couldn't get any lower, Edward Klein proves me wrong and dishes out more trash from the GOP smear machine. Republicans hate the Clintons because the Republicans think they have the God-given (literally!) right to rule everything - the White House, Congress and Supreme Court. Here, Klein dishes out unproven accusations, rumors and just plain falsehoods to smear the Clintons one more time. I have never been a huge Clinton fan, but the Republican agenda here is just so obvious. Give it a rest already!"
1,Trashing Hillary,"After the trashing of McCain, Kerry, we can expect the Rove Bush team to benefit from Klein's book. The charges trashing Hillary are wild, ludicrus and unsubstantiated for the most part. Better to read her wonderful and thoughtful book ""Living History"""
1,vile tripe,"First my disclaimers (because we liberals believe in TRUTH): I did not read the whole book. A friend photocopied the first few chapters just so I wouldn't have to put a nickle in Ed Klein's pocket. Also, before you right-wingers get your undies in a bunch, know that I am NOT a big Hillary fan. She has a lot of negatives -- not a damn one of which was mentioned in this book.This book is so full of lies, inaccuracies and innuendo that even the conservative echo chamber has, for the most part, panned it. There is nothing new here, every scrap of this brain dead drivel has been published in other, BETTER, books and articles. Klein has simply collected the work of several real authors and pasted the most negative parts together in a 'work' that couldn't pass as a tenth grade term paper."
1,heshshshs....,"I'm no big fan of Mrs.Clinton, However, she is worth more then this entire administration put togather. I MEAN THE HOLE GANG.IF SHE DECIDES TO RUN, SHE WILL EARN IT.AND TO THE RIGHT, POOHH.."
1,The Lies About Hillary,"I always prefer to get the facts from the person, rather than through someone else's probably biased interpretation of them. If you want to know Hillary Clinton, read her book, or better yet, listen to the CD set, read by herself...""Living History"". What people say about her is irrelevant. Let her speak for herself and tell you about her life in the White House. All the rest is propaganda."
1,No stars if at all,"This is another right wing piece of trash written by trash for trash. There will always be a market for this sadly. Let's keep the war going in Iraq, kill off more of our American soldiers, and continue to move backwards.Ed Klein will eat this book when Hillary Rodham Clinton is elected the 44th President of the United States as no candidate on either side is more qualified than She.I want to restore the respect for America around the world, therefor, I will be voting for Hillary !"
1,"It's Amazing What Passes for ""Journalism""",If you choose to buy this tabloid trash then your only hurting yourself. A person would have to be delusional to believe what is obviously a derivitive preemptive slander on a potential presidential candidate. Are republicans really this scared?
1,Beneath Contempt!,"This book was given to me as a joke and it turns out to be a sick one at that. At best this is a piece of trash, at worst it's a miserable example of character assignation. Edward Klein should be ashamed, deeply ashamed."
1,Absolute BULL,What does Edward Klein know about Hillary?- nothing. This guy is a hateful republican liar who's trying to ruin it for Hillary because hes scared. Everyone ( all the republicans ) are scared of Hillary because she has so much promise and is capable of becoming our next President. She has what it takes. The republicans are threatened by this so they have to write negative books about her without an ounce of truth. NOT RECOMENDED.
3,the other side of the coin,"When books are written by Michael Moore, Al Franken, Kitty Kelley, or the many other people that slander conservatives, the liberals cheer. They defend these people's ""anonymous sources"" and accusations with passion. But what happens when someone writes a similar book about Hillary Clinton? A first amendment ""scholar"", whatever that means, says it is libel and they would be sued if it didn't attract attention to the book. Well the book is number 5 on Amazon sales right now. Great strategy!Is the book fiction? It is probably just as much fiction as Hillary's ""Living History."" I am not a fan of this book or other books that try to smear people. I just wanted to point out the differnce of opinion liberals have about these books when they are written about liberals. Conservatives have behaved only slightly better."
1,Do yourself a favor; don't buy this book,"Although I'm not a fan of Ms. Clinton, this book is a sorry attempt to discredit her with innuendos, half-truths, and information gleaned from other publications. It's beyond me why some people can be so mean spirited as to compile a book like this about someone's life without first-hand knowledge of the facts. I recommend that you not waste your time and money on this book."
3,"Not a fan of Hillary, But.....","I like to bash Hilly as well as the next person but there are just to many anonymous sources quoted in this book for me to make a rational judgement of the truth. It is easy reading and I enjoyed it very much, I just had to keep an open mind as I read. As to its legitimacy, if everything is true then give me credible sources with a name."
4,great service,"Thanks to book-co. My item dud not arrive, but they replaced it without question. would defuntely use again, but probbly have items senr within USA to avoid postal problems again! Excelent service."
3,Not a Terrific Book,"I was disappointed with this book. Most of the criticism was based upon innuendo and rumour. Of what was left, the proven lying, deception and power-seeking can be applied to many top politicians. This comes from someone who is no fan of hers and was already strongly against her becoming President (I prefer Whitman, Rice or Dole as our first female President). I was hoping for more objective dirt but so much of the content is subjective. I recommend reading it as she will be a candidate in 2008 but there could have been better arguments and presentation in the copy. In summary, too much swaying by emotion and not enough by reason."
1,I'm a conservative and didn't like it!,"I am a conservative, but found this book to be sub-standard in every way. Couldn't read it to the end - plus am angry with NewsMax for endorsing it and making me buy it, as they clearly must have an anti-Hilary agenda, so much so that it clouds their minds.I don't wish to see her as President either, but that doesn't make me sink so low as to slander and trash her in such a distasteful way, and neither should they.While reading the book I kept getting one feeling, and one feeling only: That someone must have paid Klein an awful lot of money to write it. Otherwise, who would write such a book on their own volition?"
2,Better books on Hill and Bill out there,It seems to me that the hints about Bill raping Hillary were just a means to generate publicity. If you want a good book on Hillary or Bill I'd suggest Partners in Power.
4,What many thought but had no backup,I thought the book was right on in exposing what a scary and power hungry woman she is! If she was ever elected we would be in for some big time changes leaning so far towards socialism that we would be teetering on communism. Its a good read by a writer who has the credentials to prove he is not some right wingconservative nut!!!
2,Lifelong Republican Repulsed,"Klein is a facinating writer but this is really an example of the kind of sensationist ""journalism"" that is giving regular Republicans a bad name. (I know he is a liberal but let's call it spade a darn shovel, shall we? He is an opportunist trying to sell books to Republicans.)We do not need character assaination to support our philosophies. This muck sickens conservatives with an ideal."
1,Think this book is accurate?,"For those of you who read this book and took it seriously, go here: http://mediamatters.org/static/audio/airamerica_klein_20050624.mp3"
1,What A Piece of Garbage,This might be the most unfactual book I have ever read. What a horrible cut and paste job. I can't help but think this book is a joke.
1,A waste of Time,"This book is beyond tabloid trash..If you value your time. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. If you hate Hillary,Than go ahead a reaffirm everything you already know. If you consider yourself a True christian while reading this book, than shame on you. You are a hypocrite!"
1,Tabloid Garbage,"[...]This book is so error ridden, so utterly fact disoriented, and obviously intentionally slanderous, that to actually confuse it for anything more than political pie throwing is just silly.This book might as well have a picture of an alien wolf boy on the cover because it's tabloid ""journalism"" at best. At worst, it's malicious.Avoid this book at all costs unless you like reading fiction."
5,HOW MUCH WAS THE AUTHOR HOLDING BACK?,I'd like to know what really happend to Ron Brown and Vince Foster.It's no wonder some people think this book is like the National Enquirer!The Clintons are trash and their lives are National Enquirer material!Be sure to read this book before you vote for her!
4,Says everything I always thought,NOT a fan of HIllarys it about proved everthing I thought. She would do anything to be president and bill would do anything to get her there. He wants to be in the White House again
2,AVOID the audio!,"Authors should rarely read their own works (Myla Goldberg's ""Bee Season"" is a very rare exception). It may be unkind, but Mr. Klein pretty much drones his way through this one. That having been said, it is a worthwhile read (in print!) along with Dick Morris's book. Between them, the reader gets hit-over-the-head with the pattern of Hillary's behavior, her sense of entitlement, that she is ""owed"" not just by Bill, but by society in general.I was put off by Klein's habit of speaking from inside the head of Hillary, her family and friends. However, for those who say it's just a re-hash of ""allegations"" - there is SO MUCH circumstantial evidence around the Clintons that can't be discounted altogether. Think patterns, not isolated incidents with them."
1,Shoddy Journalism,"Edward Klein is getting rich off of ""shoddy journalism."" Anyone who reads this book and takes the opinion that it's a good read or he did his homework and research on Hillary Clinton is a fool. It may contain entertainment purposes for some, but it's only pure garbage. The only reason why this book is selling is not because Edward Klein's name is on it, but because some writer's and journalists find it imperative to attack a woman who has a very good chance of being our first female American President; not to mention the huge profit factor involved for Klein and the publisher (s).I completely disagree with this book and the ""facts"" (if you can call them that) in this book. Poor writing, deceptive research, plagiarized and just an insult to anyone with an ounce of intelligence."
4,Hillary Clinton-A Dangerous Politician,"Klein's book about Hillary is an eye-opening, multifaceted review of the woman whose political asperations pose a significant danger to America. She is a archtypical Socialist who would thrust the Federal Government into every facet of everyone's life in a real-life replay of Orwell's ""1984"". Keep any eye on her...she is an extremely smooth & deceptive operator."
1,This book is about neither the truth nor Hillary...,"Not a big Hillary fan but this book was written for one purpose; to make Mr. Klein a pile of money. Unless you're a foaming-at-the-mouth neocon, don't waste your money. This book is poorly written and there's nothing new here. Even if you are a neocon, I'd suggest that you wait about three months. There will be stacks of this loser on the Bargain table..."
1,Bash for Cash,"How low are folks willing to sink to further their own political agendas and line their pockets at the expense of others? I DID read this book, as much as I could stomach, at our local library, and am appalled that a reputable publisher would give credibility to such trash. Not only is the book poorly researched and written, many allegations in this book have been investigated and found to be untrue. Sadly, this is probably only the first of many such books designed to scare ignorant Americans about the future of one of our great leaders. Hillary, brush off this attack as you would a nasty, blood-thirsty flea from a dirty dog."
2,Takes One to Know One....,"Hmmmm....Klein spends the majority of the book speculating about the sexuality of the subject, as if it is terribly relevant-- or as if anyone cares. What, she is responsible for her husband being a whore? Ohhhhh, questionable financial and fundraising practices. Big ""revelation""! HELLO. This is PAC-land and find me a politician who ISN'T engaging in at least questionable or shady fundraising (if not technically illegal practices). It is built into the system and if you don't engage in it, you won't be elected. The author rips on her for her lack of taste and for her decorating. Sounds like the rantings of a biased 'mo with overarched eyebrows and too much makeup to me. Which you will see in his picture on the interior sleeve. Methinks the ""lady"" doth protest too much. And yes, I read the book, cover to cover. And yes, the irony of my criticizing the author on superficial qualities is intentional, but if it is good enough for the goose...."
5,On the mark!,"Excellent book, if a little extreme in some of the salacious details. Raises the question, do we really want this woman to be our first woman President? She was blind enough not to notice boxes of subpoenaed Whitewater documents in her personal quarters in the White House and surprised by repeat offender Bill's admission of infidelity with Monica. Blind and gullible are not impressive traits for the highest office in the land."
3,The Mars & Venus of Hillary,"It is a book about anything you want to know about Hillary Clinton from a Mars perspective in sharp contrast to the Venus side we see in the public.This book offers different section on her life, the big girl, the book of life, White House years, the candidate and the road back to White House.Her unique upbringing helped shape her strong character especially in the political era of equal rights. She is a wife, a mother, a feminist and a politician. She looks like the Empress Dowager who directed the show behind the curtain with a toleration on Bill's girl friends. She is strong in handling the Lewinsky and other sex scandals as a victim wife by ""right wing conspiracy"" phase.This book gives the rest of the story on the former First Lady of Arkansas, USA, senator, presidential candidate and what politics and ambition mean."
5,Be informed in '08,"A must-read, since it is not being reviewed by the media (word is, Hillary's people have blocked it, which made me want to know why). Explains the long range plans and people associated with her ultimate goals. Also, why she doesn't respond to Bill's ongoing affairs, throughout their marriage, as most women would. Some profanity. Read it with others about her, to be a well informed voter."
5,Great synopsis about Hillary,"This book, by a former NEWSWEEK reporter and former editor of the NY TIMES SUNDAY MAGAZINE, doesn't have a lot new in it, but is an excellent synopsis of Hillary's life and career and is an insightful look into her mind and ambitions. A MUST read. Highly recommended."
1,LYING ABOUT HILLARY,"To even give this man a review is a waste of time. The best way to describe the book is imagine someone who flips around the net to gossips sites and cuts and pastes it all into a WORD document, sticks his name on it and makes his cash. What a joke. I am only sorry that I had to click one star...it deserves none at all."
2,The Political Innoculation of Hillary,"The author's evidence is so weak that this book must be an attempt to politically innoculate Hillary prior to 2008: get out all the dirty laundry now so it's old news come the election. Hillary can then again claim victimhood status. This book has everything you've heard and more, making it a complete innoculation.Two stars for mindless-entertainment value, though it's perfect for raising the blood pressures of die-hard Hillary lovers and Hillary bashers alike."
1,"Misogynistic, Homophobic, and Untruthful - I Pity You Who Believe Ed Klein","It's funny how easilly we (the American public) accept things as fact just because they show up in print. This book is a misogynist, lying piece of trash, written sloppily by a bitter, money driven man seeking to take down a possible Presidency for cash. Check your facts."
2,Banta fodder,"Klein seems to have an ax to grind in his attempted hatchet job on Clinton. Other than Ann Coulter's ""Slander,"" where almost all the source data was attributed to LexisNexis, I have yet to see so many unattributed sources in one book. I intend to have my classes read Klein's book, or portions, and hold discussions about the need to have verifiable and credible sources, fact-checking, and the pros and cons of open partisanship."
1,Character assassination makes a mockery of US democracy,"When elections are based on how bad your opponent is rather than what you can offer the electorate, the country is in trouble.Fear and superstition look set to take the US back to the nineteenth century while the civilized world surges forward into the twenty-first century. The United States is a country in decline that needs sane leadership and values predicated upon sympathy for others rather than venom but it's electing psychopaths. Good luck on this road, dear folk, you'll need it."
3,Can you say Zealot?,"Are you a right wing nut job? Or are you a liberal weanie? This book is a dfinite litmus test. I read 43 user reviews. 21 gave the book a ""1"" (liberal weanies). 18 other gave the book a ""5"" (right wing nut jobs). Oh yeah, one person gave it a ""2"" and two others a ""3"" . Where the hell are are all the ""4""'s ?Seriously, if you gave this book a 1 or a 5 you are most likely an extremest. I havn't read the book but may get to it ( a bit of a nut job I am). It certainly not at the top of my list.Hey zealots! Take a pill!Andy"
1,Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,"Wow, I can write a libelous book, and so long as the target is a Democrat, I'll sell thousands. Shame on you, all you who buy this trash."
1,Tabloid Trash,"Klein attempts to present himself as an authentic biographer with real facts about his subject, but instead stoops to the literary sewer in this sensationalistic waste of wood pulp. If one is to assault a politician and their platform, there are more reputable, respectable ways to do so - such as using real facts. Avoid at all costs."
1,EEEWWWWWW,"I wanted to give it zero stars but Amazon won't let me.Why is it that the right can't keep their minds out of the gutter? Bill and Monica, in our faces for years whether we wanted it or not; porn stars at fundraisers caught on camera saying how sexy Karl Rove is (another ewww); and now this. I'm sorry, I couldn't take more than 40 pages. Scurrilous attacks are par for the course , of course, in politics, but this is a new low. Shame on Penguin. Jackie must be spinning in her grave."
1,"Looks to be a waste of time, money, space, and trees.","Also, Mocheman, if you actually read the posts citing Media Matters carefully, you will notice that Media Matters didn't express any opinions about the excepts already published about this book (excepting as to how the book may actually damage reputations of those who wrote, published and promote the book more than it damages Hillary's rep), only the facts that contradict the statements from the book excerpts."
1,Hillary book a work of fiction,"Klein should pursue working on the Harry Potter series! The book was so full of eerie ghosts and goblins and creepy characters, it makes one wonder did he write this or channel it? What about the sitting President? A book on this war criminal with oatmeal for brains ( I apologize to oatmeal lovers everywhere) is more suitable..and could be filled with actual photographs of our dead soldiers from Iraq."
3,Support your pundits,"Think for yourself. Don't give into propoganda, whatever side its coming from. Buying this only makes it worse. Before you drop your hard earned cash on this, ask yourself, what does this accomplish. You're wasting your time when you could be reading something worthwhile. Interested in politics, may I suggest the Federalist Papers, or The Republic of Plato.If you people started thinking for yourself, we wouldn't need things like pundits to tell us how to think."
1,"Been There, Done That","If you were fogging a mirror and alert at any time during the Bill Clinton presidency, you already know everything in this book that's worth knowing. If confirming that Hillary likes decaf and didn't shave her legs in college is worth plowing through over 300 pages of rehashed 1990's-era trivia, this is the book for you. Be forewarned though - it's not even well-written.There's a certain type of person who will buy anything derogatory about one side or the other of the political spectrum. They have more time and money than brains apparently, and there's no hope for them. For those of us who have some literary and factual standards regardless of our political leanings, this book doesn't make the cut. There are much better books for red staters (""Hell to Pay"" and ""Rewriting History"") and blue staters (""Living History"") to read about the former first lady and current Senator than this clip job."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HIPOCRITICAL PIECE OF CRAP. THIS WAS PUT OUT BY THE RUTHLESS RIGHT WING MACHINE.
1,Al Franken And Joe Conason are BRILLIANT,"I would like to thank those who directed me to the audio of the interview on (...)After hearing Mr. Klien, it is clear that he is a complete fraud. Also after hearing Mr. Franken and Mr. Conason, I must say I will be glued to the radio from now on to hear their brilliant take on the right wing hacks and their supporters."
1,Author's Obsession With Lesbians -- Pathetic,"Edward Klein must have some strange preoccupation with lesbians: throughout this book he frantically obsesses about the sexual preferences of Wellesley students in 1968; the sexual preferences of Hillary's friends; the sexual preferences of her White House staff; and of course, Hillary's own sexual preferences. This made for an excruciating read as the book revealed far more about the author than it ever could about Hillary.Other parts of the book were relegated to hearsay, rumors, and as many feminist pejoratives as this man's little brain could conjure up. Don't waste your time with this poorly written, prurient invective."
4,Hillary Cometh,"A quick, easy, must read for the Hillary hater or Hillary fence-sitter. Klein's protected sources have the ring of obvious truth.If one is concerned about a lying, megalomaniac running the most powerful country in the known universe, read this book."
2,Important read before 2008,"I much preferred ""Rewriting History"" by Dick Morris since he was a Clinton confidant for 20 years and knows Hillary better than Mr. Klein. Klein also showed me that he did not research so well - had her going to South Main HS when I know it was Maine South HS. This makes me wonder how much is factual and how much is prejudice. He does show her to be what I expected her to be, but it really was not until I noted that Dick Morris also presented many of the same stories that I thought this book was also useful. If you are a hardened conservative who just wants to hate Hillary and who doesn't care about facts when spewing vitriol - a la the left wing fanatics - you will love this book. If you want to feel secure that you are being told the truth, read ""Rewriting History"" by Dick Morris. If you live in America, do read one of the two before 2008."
2,A review from someone who has actually read this book,"I got this through overnight shipping, hoping that the hype matched the book. What this actually is is a tepid rehash of other Hillary books. She likes power. She wants to be president. Her respect for the truth is shaky. She looks the other way when it comes to Bill's adultery. She started out as a radical liberal and is moving to the center for political reasons. She has had rumors dog her that she may be gay. Nothing new here. And that is the gist of the book. No bombshells. No new revelations. Since I already thought that Hillary was a values empty yuppie who lusted to be president at any cost, this book did not offer me anything new. I feel that I fell for the hype when I preordered this with overnight shipping. I think I wasted my money."
1,Ed Klein is exposed as a Liar,Ed Klein wrote a hit-piece that's backfiring nationally. Enjoy this story and audio clip from the Al Franken show in which Franken and Joe Conason destroy Ed Klein http://mediamatters.org/items/200506240007
1,Shotty work to say the least....,"Edward Klein's work in this biography had me mad. No not because I adore Hillary or respect her ideas, but simply this book is full of poor research and major holes that anyone who did the slimest amount of research would have caught. This author wasted my time in reading this book and quite franly I'm pissed off that i spent the money to buy this poor piece of work not worthy of being published."
1,A real hatchet job,"Wow. This is easily the worst ""biography"" I've ever read. Far from being objective, insightful, or reasonably well researched, this book is simply a partisan hatchet job on Ms. Clinton. Whatever one thinks of her politics, she deserves better than this. This book comes the closest of any I've seen to libel. Don't patronize this type of trash or we'll continue to get more -- from both parties."
1,"Less than zero stars, actually...","I am a full-time reader. That's what I do. I spend at least forty hours a week reading. And ""The Truth About Hillary"" has pushed a great many books off my shelfload of books about Washington to earn the title of The Worst Book Leslie Has Ever Read.Yes, that's right. Klein manages to be thinly sourced, poorly organized, and scatterbrained, all at the same time. At least one of the sources whom he cites, Michael Tomasky, has noted that Klein excised part of an article by Tomasky from a quotation, in an effort to make former Sen. Pat Moynihan appear more dismissive of Hillary Clinton.If you want to read a book that speculates in literally the same breath whether the former First Lady is asexual, lesbian, or--the most heinous sin, in Klein's eyes--ambitious, well, here's your book.As it stands, it remains THE WORST BOOK LESLIE'S EVER READ."
1,Such Obvious Tactics.....,"The goal of this book is so painfully obvious. Just start some rumors and get your lies about Senator Clinton PUBLISHED now, somewhere. Even though they'll be repudiated when the book comes out, they can be dredged up and QUOTED again in 2008. Mark my words, the most discredited content in this book, allegations that are unsupported by any facts or documented attribution whatsoever, will be gleefully quoted in speeches, in blogs, on television, by Conservatives in 2008. And they'll COUNT on the people in their audiences who will say, ""Oh, those things came from a BOOK about her! They MUST be true!"" Conservatives have perfected the art of the dirty trick. Reprehensible, of course, but...you've gotta hand it to them. They plan ahead....and execute the character assassination in a coordinated manner, absolutely flawlessly."
3,E Klein: Truth about Hillary,The book is easy to read and clearly describes the events around the Clintons. Hillary is a cleverly determined woman and nothing stands in the way of her goals....not even infidelities.
1,The author should be ashamed of himself.,"Just read this synopsis of Klein's ridiculous claims, and then how he's backed off of them:http://mediamatters.org/items/200506220002When SEAN HANNITY is questioning your material and sources for a book that's critical of Hillary Clinton...wow, that's bad.And yet all the liberal-bashers have happily pre-ordered this book full of lies.These books just get more and more ridiculous. What could be next? Howard Dean is a minion of Satan? Nancy Pelosi is possessed by the ghost of Hitler? I mean, HOW can anyone take this stuff seriously?Being ""conservative"" sounds good on paper, but I'll tell you what--I will NEVER vote for ANYONE with an R next to his or her name.One star."
1,It takes a village idiot....,"It takes a village idiot to spend their money on this book, let alone believe a single word of it. (One star was given because Amazon does not allow a lower rating. I would have given it a negative 5)"
2,Read it -- Judge for yourself,"A fast -- throw away summer read. Too many ""first person"" unsubstantiated accounts. Words tilted so far to the right, I'm surprised they stand up on the page. Other reviewers have have already disputed the facts. It will anger those of you who support the Dems and Hillary. The rest of you will smile smuggly. I enjoyed it for entertainment value, but nothing else."
3,+++Merely confirmed my suspicions...but...+++,"I believe Hilliary Clinton to be a dangerous socialist who would harm this country (perhaps) beyond repair should she make it to the Oval Office, so I was ready and willing to be completely sold on every evil detail in this book...I believed Mr. Klein's reportage to be thorough, but not groundbreaking and not without wiggle room on some of his sourcing and facts. I hate to say it, because, like I say, I believe her to be a dangerous person, but while this book is a fun read for those of us who see her as a shameless opportunist, there's nothing new here..."
1,Pathetic waste of time and paper,"Truly pathetic, this attempt to disparage Hillary Clinton is reflective of the author's apparent lack of more intelligent ways to occupy his time.Poorly written rehash of meaningless material, it serves to prove some publishers will print anything. It makes one want to yawn.. ""So what?"" I usually do not waste time reviewing books which I find totally boring, but this one is SO bad, I am compelled to warn others.. Whatever you do with your time...do not throw it away on this trash.If anything, it may win Hillary more supporters! It certainly reinforces my own hope to see her in the White House as its first female President."
1,Edward Klein is a HACK!!!!!!,"If you want to read comedy, and not a biography about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, please read Klein's book! After reading more than half of it, I couldn't suffer through it any longer. Klein writes for a second-grade audience. He repeats over-used buzzwords, like, ""far left,"" ""left wing,"" radical liberal"" to describe Senator Clinton. He also favors the words,""lesbian,"" ""asexual,"" etc. Query: How can one be ""asexual"" and a ""lesbian""? And, how can a woman give birth to a child and be ""asexual""? Help me, now! So,... Senator Clinton is ambitious; intelligent; and cares more about politics, and her and her husband's careers more than hair and makeup. Does that make her less of a woman? NO!!!! It makes her..... my favorite candidate for the U.S. President in 2008!"
1,"I Haven't Read The Book, But From The Title It Sounds Mean And Bad-Natured","All my life, I have respected and agreed with Hilary Clinton. Bill Clinton was one of my favorite presidents (Jimmy Carter, Abe Lincoln, etc). When I read the cover for this book, it really sounded like an insult, not just an opinion. I read the back, which said something about how Hilary acted like she cared but really didn't, and that she had an evil scheme to make herself powerful. I know the author/s of this book have their opinions about certain people. But I don't think they need to go around telling people what a bad person she is. I think that books should be about positive things, not negative things. Although the author feels deep resent for Hilary Clinton, he needs to mind his own business. After all, people are people, no matter what their opinions are."
1,Book of quotations,"My my my, Mr. Klein can stretch his imagination further than a used condom. This ""book"" or more apparently a collection of suggestions from the rightwing echo chamber puts forth the contention that feminism, or most any belief that females are of equivalent intellectual status with men, springs from Hillary's alma mater, a supposed hotbed of lesbianism, a concept clearly invented in the overheated brain of some adolescent boy deprived of the use of both hands. The fantastic recycling of other people's ""facts"" apparent in the footnotes fails to promote a single original insight into the woman or the ideas she champions. Misogynistic garbage is being foisted upon the reading public by Penguin's massive lapse of editorial oversight in allowing this tittilating collection of lies, supposition and prurient design through its presses."
1,Hillary,"This book just makes me want to vote for Hillary more in 2008. If people feel the need to spread lies and share their ignorance, then they must really view her as a threat! Hillary 2008!!!"
4,"True, but we already know it","The Truth about Hillary, by Edward Klein, is a brief story about the Hillary Clinton's quest for power. There is no new material presented here; it has all been said before. Hillary is dishonest, a charlatan, and a tyrant, who will do anything to become president. Unfortunately, not many seem to be concerned; for inexplicable reasons, she continues to get elected into office. This book is brief, with lots of white (big font, short chapters, wide margins), and can easily be read in a few hours. I disliked Klein's frequent use of colloquialisms, which weaken the credibility of the book. There are better, more informative books out there about this infamous woman, but this one is probably the shortest collection and the quickest to read."
2,Incredibly dull,"From the title of this book, I was expecting all kinds of revelations about Hillary Clinton that I had never heard before, and stories of her committing blackmail and murder in order to secure the Presidency that she has secretly coveted for so many years. However the actual text of this book contains far from it. While I did learn more about Hillary than I previously knew, I found very little to justify the title of this book, which deceives the reader into believing this will be more than just a rehashing of things that the media has already cited. In fact, the majority of this book deals with the Lewinsky scandal, which by now bores me to tears.The book is somewhat well-written, however the best writing in the world can't cover up for a lack of good content. It seems like Klein decided to jump on the ""shocking political tell-alls"" bandwagon and release this book, which is anything but ""tell-all."""
1,Treatise on Hate,"If you want to learn about all of the ways that you can criticise another person, deserved or not, please read this book. The author criticizes Hillary for sleeping, for not sleeping enough and for sleeping too much. He criticizes her for being too sexual and not sexual enought. It is crazy! He occasionally mentions her politics.I voted for O'Bama, but Hillary is an incredible person. It is bizzare to criticise her for being a person and sleeping! All of the rest is equally as illogical and self-contradictory.It is nothing but treatise on hate which is necessarily illogical."
3,Ho and Hum,"The book start out reviewing Hillary's sorted past and the the last half was almost a support for her Presidential aspirations.It's either one way or the other.The first half and the second half ought to be separate books with separate titles.I had a friend read it, without my comments, and he had the same opinion!"
1,Horsecrap,I'm not particularly comfortable with Hillary and I'd rather not see her get nominated or elected President. That said:This is Horsecrap. Complete and utter. Shameful.
1,Too many inaccuracies to be credible.,"The quality of the writing and ""storytelling"" aside, this book cannot be taken seriously due to so many easily checked errors. Incorrect names, incorrect quotes, and ommissions which completely change the meaning of what happened or was said.Right wing hack or not, he certainly wrote this book just for the money.What a waste of my time."
1,The spin machine breaks down ... again,"This author has been so carved, spindled, mutilated and thoroughly discredited in his recent media appearances to tout this ripe tripe that he has gone underground while only the right-wing belfry is left to pad his bank account. Pathetic. And so is this book-like object."
1,An Unnecessary Read,"If you already hate Hillary you may be tempted to buy this book. But why would you waste your time and money on a book that has the author claiming that some facts are wrong, and that Rush Limbaugh and Peggy Noonan claim have nothing to do with the conservatives?In addition, many of the book's points are a regurgitation of points you probably already know.Check out:http://mediamatters.org/topics/thetruthabouthillary.htmlLife is too short to read 3rd rate information."
2,I don't see the problem,So this book is sensationalistic. What's the big deal? I don't think anybody with half a brain really believes Hillary is a good person. She's a politician for crying out loud. Why rag on the author? I mean it's not like Michael Moore did the same thing with his 9/11 movie. It was a film of lies and this book probably is as well. Yet we praise Moore and trash this guy. Nice liberal media we have in this country.
1,Lies,"Too many lies, too much speculation, too much opinion. Don't get me wrong, these are all accepted in various amounts but please - Stop coming up with your own accusations and publishing them and actually defend yourself. Theres no defending on any of this mans topics. Show me proof, show me fact, that defends his claims and I may be able to take him seriously - though I doubt it."
1,Sad Republicans buy into this......,"I feel sorry for Republicans who buy this expecting some expose' that Hillary Clinton is actually a bad woman. This tabloid filled book shows that Republicans are scared of Hillary and are already trying to discredit her. Reading this book feels like reading a sleezy tabloid with no credibility. So what if she has ambition and desire, does that make her a bad person?"
1,Are You Kidding?,"I am astounded that this book is classified as nonfiction, considering all the speculation, opinion, and flat-out lies it contains. I actually laughed at a few parts. Are conservatives so desperate and shameless as to tear down a woman who has a history of nothing but accomplishment, ingenuity and personal strength? Absolute filth."
3,It is a shame...,All this negative energy from both parties is shameful. Why can't we change for the positive instead of waiting for another 9/11 to happen again and force us to examine ourselves once again? Hate will never make our country strong. It only hurts our future generation.
2,Look for this one in the bargain bins soon!,"Another 'bash the left' book written to placate the hatred and opponent villification of the right. Can't they win on their own merits and without bashing their opponents? Apparently not. This is obviously written with the 2008 elections in mind.No wonder politics today is in the state it's in.Once the minority of hard-righties are done salivating over it, look for this one in the bargain bin (see 'Unfit For Command')."
1,Lies and more lies,"I guess if your a right wing nut job, ignorant, or just can't handle strong women (not mutually exclusive traits) you will like this book. If you possess any kind of intelligence or fair-mindneness you will see it as the hatchet job and disgusting piece of garbage that it is."
1,not factually correct,"As a politically independent minded person I found this book to be recycled rumors that have already been debunked by credible media sources. This book seems to be full of personal opinions as the statements are not factually true. If you are a conservative Clinton hater who will believe anything bad you hear regardless of the facts, you will probably be in bliss. If you care about facts that are true and are an independent critical thinker, spend your money on some other book."
2,"I Despise The Woman, But Klein Could Have Done Better","The definitive book about Bill is ""No One Left To Lie To"", by Christopher Hitchens. He knows how to take a scapel and wield it to reveal the core of a maggot. This book is way too soft."
4,The Truth About Hillary,Suspicians confirmed. Mr. Klein pointed out how dirty and criminal politics has become in the hands of liberals. The Clintons rose to power on the bodies of others. I shudder to think what would happen to this country if Hillary is voted in as President (and Bill will be placed in a possition of power ) .
5,Hillary in '08-Lord Help Us,"I wasn't going to write a review until The New York Times wrote a sidebar in the Top 10 vilifying this book.They haven't even reviewed it.Mr Klein,in an apparent concerted effort,has not been invited to the talk show circuits on tv and radio to discuss this book.Liberals are working day and night to sweep this book under the carpet.The book is well written and his facts are well documented with references.This book takes up where Barb Olson's,""Hell To Pay"" leaves off.Well worth reading before deciding on whom to vote for in 2008."
1,"Apparently, this book is full of mistakes.","I thought this was an entertaining book until I heard the author on the Al Franken Show today and he couldn't answer for any of the mistakes/lies that he has in the book. So now I am having a tough time believing most of the garbage in this book. Before anyone else buys this book, they should read the transcript from the Al Franken Show. You can view it here.http://www.geocities.com/david2503/FrankenShow.htm"
1,I can not believe politics can go this low,I just go through the book and find this book full of garbage. When this author claims with no real facts that Chelsea was born because of rape... I know somebody is behind this to murder her on political front. I guess it will work against republicans. Repubs already facing lots of problem because of their lies about Iraq and this will prove blunder... It could spoil her chances for presidency but publication time is 100% incorrect. He should publish it just like swift boat kind of stuff.
1,Didn't know I bought this model,The review says I purchased a book about the queen but I wouldn't have done such a stupid thing. Must be an error.
2,"Hopefully, This Book Will Make You Sick","Not about Hillary, but it will make you sick about our sick political system which is at an all time low. Our political system is belching gas, lies and hate mongering. Don't buy this book, but if you can borrow a copy you will see the lowpoint that our political system has fallen to. We are desperately in need of statesmen and stateswomen. Hillary might even be one, but how will we ever know the answer with all the mudslinging."
1,Waste of money!,"Shame on those of you who purchased this book instead of borrowing it like I did.David Brock's book, ""Blinded by the Right"", described the hypocritical, massive Republican attitude against the Clintons. But that was then and this is now, and these people need to get a life. Or, is it that they see in others what they see in themselves? And are they afraid of Hillary? and why?? Because Billy Graham and others endorse her for running our country? Godspeed, I say."
1,Conservative ... not vindictive.,"I am a conservative and I am no fan of the Clinton's. My opinion of them is based on things I know to be true. I am not going to read this book. It is nothing more than a smear against Hillary - which is what conservatives are always accusing liberals of doing. If you want to read an objective book about Hillary Clinton without any name-calling or vindictiveness, read American Evita: Hillary Clinton's Path to Power by Christopher Andersen."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent book. In my opinion, the history and character of a candidate should be known before an election. That way, there's no long term damage done from voting for the wrong person. This book will help the American voter know the real Hillary Clinton better, and not just the image of Hillary the media has chosen. This book is a great buy and a must have for every home library."
1,Not worth the shipping price,"If this was not an obvious attack on her because of her POPULARITY to run in 2008 it would STILL be a bad book, but that fact added with the transperant right wing stance made it even worse. This book simply humanizes her, it makes her seem like an average person, not like she is unfit for command. And about how far she would to to become president... it sounds like a average statement about all politicians. I can not remember a single person who would not go to great lengths to conceal things that would hurt there campaign. Remember, centrism is the future not far right or far left. Perserve the future for our childrens children!"
1,Hard to belive a reputable publisher paid for this.,"Read the book.Spent the past 45 years as a Goldwater conservative, and found it not only lacking in genuine political material, but also larded with ad hominem attacks based on inaccuracies, misquotes and untruths.For those who want to defeat liberals (including Sen. Clinton) at the polls, they would be better off dusting off the real ""family values,"" beginning with Truth. And this does not mean misusing the term in the title of a book length supermaket tabloid."
1,Book Never Came,"When a month had passed and no book, I emailed the vendor and she said she'd look into it. Still haven't heard anything, and no book in sight. What's with this?"
2,"Over-written, pretentious stuff","This man's problem is obvious. In his youth he dreamed of being a writer, and dropped out of college to flee to NYC and attempt literary fame. Failing, he finished college and taught prep school for a half a dozen years, and then decided to try for literary fame again as a ""food writer."" Unfortunately, although he is right about how to eat an avocado, most of his recipes are downright uninteresting and his writing is at times absurd.This man actually wrote that he wanted to understand why the food we eat wanted to kill its father and sleep with its mother! I don't know what you may think, but I find this a pretty dumb question to ask of a turnip!On another page, he informs us that he loves BBQ ribs and that they are ""rebarbative."" Oooh, a hard word! Alas, it means ""very irritating or repulsive,"" not a good fifty-dollar word to apply to the food you love to eat.Deservedly out of print."
4,Sacred cows make the best burgers,Good tips for real business life.From my point of view it would be interesting to have a review looking at the latest changes in world economy enviroment.
1,terrible 2,I am totally of the same opinion with serbian friend who commented on this book three years ago.Please buy Thomas Egenes' 'Intros to Sanskrit 1 and 2'. Avoid Whitney and Gonda.
2,Disappointing,"We love other DK ""Eyewitness Guides,"" but this one didn't cut the mustard. It worked well as an travel overview of the region, but failed to mention several important points such as days and hours of operation and entrance fees to attractions, which we were stung by several times. A specific example was their recommendation of snorkeling at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. The book lists it as one of the best snorkeling spots in the U.S., but failed to mention that in order to see anything other than sea grass and the occassional crab, you are required to make reservations on a guided snorkeling boat. The guide also lacked directions. The maps that were included were insufficient. The restaurant recommendations we tried were fine, though, and we appreciated, as usual, the fine photos and ""streetsmart"" section."
4,Ordinary girl - a magical child,This book is a wonderful teaching tool . I will be using this in my Earth based spirituality church teachings. I teach the children here in Utah at The Church of the Sacred Circle. It has many great stories that I know the children will be able to relate to. Thank you for a great resource.
4,"Endearing book, illustrations lacking","As both a parent and a 12-year practitioner, I found the book to be both a great tool for teaching the truth about Wicca to non-Wiccan children as well as a useful storybook for my own children. The blend of real-life experiences of the little girl, Rabbit, and history and theology are very well done and palatable for elementary-aged children. The writing is smooth and Rabbit's story is believable. I give this book only four stars because I believe that children's books (i.e. those for grade school) that have illustrations should have high quality illustrations. The illustrations were good, but not to my standards. All in all, it is a rather endearing book. There need to be more like this."
4,good introduction to why the drug warriors are wrong,"Sullum addresses myths and misconceptions about drug use and abuse, compares the facts about illegal and legal drugs, and makes the case that there is such a thing as responsible use of illegal, as well as legal, drugs. This is a well-written and interesting book that covers the history of drug and alcohol prohibition, addiction and the consequences of drug use and abuse, and argues for moving to a more sane policy on drugs in the United States. This would be an excellent first book to read on drug prohibition and why the ""war on drugs"" is foolhardy, after which the reader could move on to books like Hamowy's _Dealing with Drugs_."
5,Saying Yes,"I purchased this book about 4 years ago and used it for an English project over drugs and their exaggerated effects as told by the media. As I was reading this book, I realized that Jacob Sullum was saying exactly my thoughts and feelings over this subject. The book is a great read because although the reader has his own opinion, he shares views from both sides of the story and then elaborates with scientific data statistical data. Overall, I was very pleased with this book and learned a lot from it. Whether you're a conservative drug-free father, or an open-minded student, this book was very informational and helped to teach about drugs and their effect on the world by using data rather than biased beliefs."
2,"History, little more","I've well versed on the history and (my words) ""evolutionary legacy"" that have brought us to this current age of prohibition. Indeed, the first third of your book reiterates this to the masses in such a way that only a small subset of those masses would learn something new...but this is my opinion. It's a great conversation piece for me, nothing more."
5,Excellent resource,"It is amazing how much propaganda there is about drugs, and most of it is untrue. This is a must read."
2,Sad,It made me sad to see the wonderful Richard Greene in such a poorly made movie. The special effects weren't special and the plot didn't make sense. Mr. Greene allowed some cosmetician to practically shave his head. He should have had more pride than to have lowered himself to do it.
4,Loved it,Recieved exactly what I expected. Very happy and I plan to come here again for anything else I may need!
4,ATMOSPHERIC WOOLRICH,"The story is not that great, but this a very moody, atmospheric Woolrich. Nice read."
2,disappointing bordering on insulting,"i devoured this book last night and was so freaked out by the end i came onto amazon to see what others were saying. i usually love ms. dodd, but i felt an alien finished the book that began so wonderfully. if a man betrays you and your country, lands you (a princess) in jail for a week, and foments a war, it is NOT romantic to have sex (in jail) upon his reappearance and forgive him the day after the fighting stops. it is insulting to any intelligent woman to consider this scenario acceptable. made the heroine seem worse than shallow and the hero smarmy. his motivations were so weak and his ""redemptions"" weaker in the scope of what he did. what tripe."
3,Um ok,"so I got this book and you know what its about from reading aboutfrom reading above so i wont't go into that. If you have read the runnaway princess you know who dom is. I am sorry but after what he did in that book how was I supposed to like him. Frankly I didn't start to like him here after what he does. It was a good read but not one of her best. I like this writer, and some parts of the story I liked."
5,Sexy and fun!!!,"Once again, Christina Dodd kept me up late reading. I just couldn't put this book down. If you only buy one book this month, make it SOMEDAY MY PRINCE!!!"
3,LIGHT AND ENTERTAINING,"SOMEDAY MY PRINCE, a romance novel, is fantasy-filled and suited more to a reader in the teenage years. It's the story of Laurentia, a princess who knows the secret of her country's wealth, and Dom, a mercenary whose job it is to seduce her into telling him that secret. Neither is what the other expected. Yet they fall in love and live happily ever after. It's a very light read."
2,Boring and Unbelievable,Not one of Ms. Dodds best. I could not even finish it. I was tired of Dom talking about his honor and having to take care of Brat and Ruby. Give me a break. At the end of the book we are suppose to forget all that he did. I think not. I really disliked this story.
2,"Okay romance, not very interesting...","The story and love scenes are okay, but it was hard for me to fall in love with the characters. I also had a hard time understanding why Princess Laurentina fell in love with Dom. Their relationship did not develop through the pages. Perhaps another one of Ms. Dodd's books would be better."
1,Not What You Expect !!,I have always been a great fan of all the music of Roger Whittaker and was surprised to see a cd available with what seems like all the hits on and other well known tracks . Could'nt wait for it to arrive - VERY DISAPPOINTING - obviously the Australians - where this cd was made - do not have the same principles about selling greatest hit albums which ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS - all the tracks on this album are very poor redone versions of the originals - nowhere on the box does it state that the songs are NOT THE ORIGINALS !True Roger Whittaker fams will not be happy with this Australian rip off album !Not recommended !
3,Know before you buy.,"I had hoped for an all original recording, but this set has some old and some new arrangements. It is the only way to lsten to cd quality of old songs. I'm happy to own it, I just wished it had more of the old recordings. P.S. disc 2 is not very good."
1,are you kidding?,"two people give this product a bad review...and the third person gives a commercial advertisement for how great the product is. I think i'll trust the first two, and ignore the fact the the producer of the product is trying to boost his rating by posting a bunch of crap that doesn't seem to be accurate."
2,Not as Pictured...Lid Leaks,According to Acehardware The manufacturer has made the change in the item. The Spout...well it is not...it is now just a small hole for pouring..if your the type that likes to take a swig out of your jug prepared for the dribble of liquid down your chin. The other selling feature...drip/leak proof...forget it!! It does leak out of the lid. The only thing nice about it is that it has a nice hand grip which would have been nice if you were able to drink out of it.
1,"Yup, it leaks!","Wish I had read the other review. It's not the right jug. And, yes, it leaks. Why does it get 2 stars from the other reviewer???"
5,Perfect...,Well got it early and works great smell isnt great but i dont itch or anything only smooth skin my man and i are both pleased thank you....
5,Mireille Mathieu sings Ennio Morricone,No one has to convince me that Mireille can singEnnio Morricone's music. She has the most fantasticversatile voice range I have ever heard. I have beena fan of her singing since 1968 when I first arrivedin France for 2 years. She is the only Frenchsinger I will ever listen to.
2,Not One Of The Better True Crime Books,"This book detailing the Florida case of Mary Hill, found guilty of the vehicular homicide of her daughter and best friend, was at best a ""so-so"" read. The author included far too many court documents and her own biased opinion of the defendent in it's pages to fit my taste. (The author in one chapter describes Hill as looking like Aileen Wournos while sitting in court for one hearing - COME ON! - useless information) The book itself is kind of thrown together and never obtains a nice flowing narrative that would keep the most avid true-crime reader interested. Not Recommended UPDATE: As of Feb. 26, 2006, Hill is still out of prison on a $50,000 bond while her appeal goes through the FL. court system."
2,Book Moves Very Slow & Researched From Court Transcripts!,"Not really a known writer here, I live here in central Florida and remember the case well & the day this tradgedy Happened! How do you feel sorry for a ""RICH"" women driving at high speed and killing not only her own child but someone elses? Book not really the entire story and not a good read at all.I will add it to all my other FLORIDA TRUE CRIME library collection that I started sometime ago! My bookcase is getting really full though!""ALOT HAPPENS HERE"""
2,Appraising From A to Z,"I felt this book lacked needed information for any serious student of Real Estate Appraisal. It did not seem to fill the void for information required for a beginning Appraiser and definetely would not be of use to an intermediate or experienced appraiser. It completely eliminated the Income Approach to Valuation saying it was beyond the scope of this book. If you do not need a comprehensive book on Appraising and are looking for a quick overview on the industry this is probably the book for you. However, Fundamentals of Real Estate Appraisal by Ventolo/Williams provides very complete detailed information in easy to read format."
3,Good info BUT incomplete and organized loosely,I know alot about building and am getting into home inspection. The information in the book was helpful but I know from looking at inspection checklists and other books that this one left out or short-changed some critical inspection areas. It almost seemed as though the author just got tired of writing certain sections. All in all it's a decent deal for the money but it could only be an introduction to much more carefully crafted reference/instructional books.
3,Not enough Technique,"I was disappointed with this book. There is some lovely work illustrated and the biographies of the artists doing the work are comprehensive, but as a newcomer to doing work for outdoor installations I would have preferred more ""how-to"" information. For instance, there is no chapter on how to deal with the freeze-thaw cycle; you can glean some information from many of the artists about the techniques they use, but it is not organized as a comprehensive topic. The information about the mechanics for making a fountain is sketchy at best--basically, it's determined to be hard to do and must be figured out on a trial-and-error basis."
4,Art history plus technique,"A bit heavy on biographical sketches for my taste, but the bios will be of interest to students of art history. Most bios are followed by a section on ""Techniques"" containing very useful details, but since the book is organized by ceramists, there is no quick way to find the technical info you are looking for. Well-written and good for casually browsing."
5,Great Bio's on History's Giants in Industry!,"Inspiring, thought provoking, and motivating! A great book to read when you are feeling down and out to help pick you up and know that success can happen and that the pitfalls are just part of the game ... as proved time and again by those monumental men and women who ""made it."""
3,The CISSP Prep Guide: Gold Edition,"I first purchased and studied using the excellent book by Shon Harris. It was suggested I also use the 'The CISSP Prep Guide: Gold Edition' to augment my studies. I found this to be excellent advice.'The CISSP Prep Guide: Gold Edition' explained concepts a little different than Shon's book did. The sample test in the Prep were worded, I feel, closer to the exam. This book covered some concepts in more detail than Ms. Harris. However, I can also say Shon's book covered other concepts in more detail.I feel both books are necessary to study and pass CISSP.I passed the exam first try."
2,There are errors in this book!,"I just took my exam yesterday and attended a week long seminar to prepare. This book has errors in it and was really difficult to read for me (the cryptography section was written in mathematical formulas).A better choice is The All in One CISSP Prep Guide by Shon Harris. That book also includes a CD with practice exams.Even though I took the test yesterday, I just ordered the Shon Harris book for my reference. That is how good that book was.Good luck on the test."
3,Not everything is inside books,"I found it very intresting, it took me up and running in two weeks before ISC2 course, but.... I think that most of the CISSP exam is about experience and developed criteria. So what the book can tell you is how wide and deep is the arena you are confronting in the exam.And a little caution. It's old in technology time. So watch out for updates on its topics."
4,"very good, but too broad","This is a great cissp prep book.But my only complaint is that the authors sometimes venture into areas, which are pretty, much off topic.Other than that, a winner of a book."
1,Awful...,"I was recently forced to read this book in class. It is the sort of book that i would ever choose to read or enjoy, and this probably affects my judgement of the book.To begin with, it starts by trying to hook your attention, using the past tense in regards to the narrators brother and all the way through drops hints as to what happens in the insipid ciimax, this i disliked strongly, as a good book should be able to keep you reading without obvious ""cliffhangers""The characters are under-developed, apart from Figgis who is the only character who i share any sympathy with. The narration, done by Tom, Figgis' brother, is littered with metaphors and similies and this is unlike any male i know of.I was, all in all, disappointed with my english teacher for choosing such a dull book for my class."
2,Nice Quilts but too many errors,I ran into the same problem as the previous review with the Rail Fence quilt. Also the design called Island Star contains errors both in the finished size (51.5 x 41.5) and some of the cutting instructions. It is a lovely quilt so I would suggest making a sample block first to be on the safe side.
4,Good smelling sunscreen,"Good sunscreen, love the smell, but don't really care for the pump. I bought both the pump and the regular bottle and much prefer the regular bottle."
5,WONDERFUL,"I, taking a chance, entered the name Min Gai Ya on my google page and again found this marvelous cookbook. The receipt for Shabu Shabu alone is priceless and worthy of purchasing the book. I lost the book and receipt 20+ years go but the memory of the food it creates has never left me, to bad the ingredients and portions did. I can't tell you how pleased I am that I can again purchase it and create a meal for favored friends and I rarely cook anymore but this is worth the exception. Truly it is an unforgettable dish as well as the many others. Purchase it and thank me later, you will."
2,Fairly useless,"This oddity is interesting to read, and does contain an occasional gem of a recipe. However, Mr. Rudzinski repeatedly expresses his dislike of dashi (one of the fundamental seasonings in Japanese cookery) and he generally substitutes chicken broth. So, his recipes have been needlessly Americanized. He also steers the reader away from certain dishes, because they taste different. Used as a guide for timid Americans visiting Japan, the book may have a use. As an authentic Japanese cook book, it is almost useless."
1,Book Not For Amateurs,"Unless you are a serious student of herpetology, do not buy this book. It does not contain photos or descriptions intended for the use of the general public, but tables and numbers that mean nothing to me. If you don't know what you are looking for, you are certainly not going to find it here.This was an expensive lesson for me to learn. I hope this prevents someone else from doing the same."
3,shoes,love the shoes but seriously....it would have been nice to have instructions on how to attach the ribbons !! Im still not positive Im getting it right
3,The good and the bad...,"Bought this from Amazon as they were offering one of the best prices as well as i liked the design.The good:Its shiny! Want a little bling without breaking the bank? this CAN be it.Light watch, i even own a Articura which is heeeavy (also my favorite watch - I own 3 Seikos)Easy to use/read timelooks quite stylishI have it for 2+ years, other than a battery change, no problems _at all_The bad:Theres just one thing that really bugs me about this watch and hence the low rating, you cant see it in the picture/s of the watch but the rotating bezel looks and feels like a cheap plastic piece (of...).From a distance you cant make it out so well, but come into talking distance with a person and you can.A real pity really, because other than that one point that spoils the whole package to a certain degree, this would be a fantastic little timepiece."
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND,I PURCHASED AS A GIFT FOR A FAMILY FRIEND. HE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE HANDS DID NOT ILLUMINATE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SEE THE TIME AT NIGHT.
5,Liza Lou,"This is one of my favorite children's books. I gave it to my daughter when she was a little girl, so I order this one for a great, great niece who is two. Her grandmother reads it to her and she loves it. Her grandmother tells me that she carries it around with her all over the house. Its a wonderful little book.Thanks for the opportunity to share my opinion.Be Blessed!! pegk"
5,LIZA IS BRILLIANT!,I was in the library with my little cousin and ran into Liza Lou. I remember it being the most frequently read book between me and my two brothers growing up. The illustrations are brilliant and the story is everything an adventure should be for a little kid. But I'm not little anymore and I still love it! I read it to my friends at a New Year's party this past year; you would have thought they would have told me to quit being square but they were so into it! I'm so glad I found it here at Amazon and didn't have to resort to stealing it from the library!
3,Three Things You Should Know About This Video,"For me, in my preparation for a trip to St. Petersburg, the Global Treasures DVD for that city was somewhat enjoyable to watch. However, you should be aware of the following:1. The DVD is only ten minutes long (and the first minute is taken up by Global Treasures marketing).2. It would not play on our DVD players or on my iMac (that will play commercial DVDs). However, I was able to convert the DVD file to another format and import it as a ""TV Show"" into iTunes and then it played (with sound) on my computer.3. The photography was somewhat fuzzy. Perhaps that was the result of the conversion process (I just don't know) -- normally, photo or movie images are very sharp on my new iMac screen.Other DVDs that deal with St. Petersburg are available from Amazon.com and the ones that I have seen are all superior to this one."
3,Don't like glass,I had to call and place my order. When I talked to a young gentleman I specifically told him I did not want the glass bottle. When I received my order I got glass again but at least I didn't break this one. The vitamin is darker and has a thicker consistency than in the plastic bottle.
4,Great product......,"No doubt this product works. I found Nature's Oasis Joint Complete is EXACTLY the same but a little less expensive because it is in a plastic bottle that's easier to ship. But either way, excellent products that relieve my shoulder and neck pain."
3,"works well, but ugh, the taste!","I've just started using this product after several years using a different brand of liquid glucosamine. I will say this seems to be a very effective product, helping to ease the aches and pains in my knees, back, and neck. The taste is tough to overcome, however. It's like drinking that old fluoride stuff the dentist used to put on your teeth in the mold. Because it works well, I will tough out the flavor. It's only two tablespoons and I just take it down like medicine. *shudder*"
5,A great ending despite all the hoops,"Wow! What a powerful book. You won't be putting this one down once you start.Not having being 'adopted out' I had no idea of the feelings of adoptees. I can certainly understand why you would want to know the backgrounds of your birth family but was unaware, or never thought about, the hoops you have to go through to find this information out and then the sensitivity you need should you try to reach out to your birth family. Rick has done it all with alacrity and has found both happiness in siblings that he never knew he had, a parent who is bound to her new life, and a grandmother from the old school who gives him short shrift.Just a great read."
1,Doesn't Work on Mac,"I closely read all the information on Amazon about this product, and should have seen something...anything...about it not being compatible with Mac OSX, but I did not. Upon purchasing it, and receiving it, the box didn't say anything about it not being compatible with Mac OSX either, so I started to set it up, and got it all plugged in when the computer said there was no driver available for it. A call to Canon support confirmed this, and now I'm stuck with buying a printer twice as expensive to get the same features that would be available for Mac. Thanks Canon."
2,Careful. Will not function as advertised,"Excellent printer for the price. It is supposed to be an MF, however, but, contrary to its advertised compatibility, if you have Windows 7, it ain't. (1.) It will not function as a standalone scanner, because the utility that ships with has not been upgraded past XP (according to Canon Technical Support). It will scan if you have ""Windows Fax and Scan"", the utility native to Win 7 open. Something advertised as a scanner, however, should scan - regardless of whether it is connected to a computer or not. It also will not FAX, for the same reason. So what you have is a printer/copier, not a printer/copier/fax/scanner as advertised."
1,"When it doesn't jam, it prints askew","My last Canon printer was a Multipass and I purchased in 1996. I used it for 14 years. I'd still use it but Canon doesn't support it anymore and it won't work with Windows 7.So I was forced to buy another printer. Since my last Canon worked so well, I bought this model. Big mistake. It consistently prints askew. It usually draws in several sheets of paper at a time which causes the machine to jam. I printed a South West boarding pass a few weeks ago and it was such a mess the ticket agent couldn't scan it when I tried to board.I lose at least 50% of the paper I run through the machine to jams and askew printing.I'm shopping for a new printer now."
3,Nightmare if you have Windows 7,"First, let me say that we are avid fans of Canon. We've had a couple of their small printers and have a couple of their cameras which have always worked wonderfully.Now to this product: What a nightmare!! We have the Windows 7 operating system, and getting this product loaded on that computer was just horrible. After three hours of messing with various drivers and tech support, (and messing with the ports on our computer), we finally were able to get the drivers installed and the computer working. The printer itself is working beautifully, but the installation was a bear. If you are using the Windows 7 operating system, then consider another Canon printer other than this one."
4,windows7 problems? go to andrew's blog.,"love this printer! main reason why I bought it is because inkjet has been costing me too much. second reason, because it has everything- copy machine, printer, fax, and scanner. and price couldn't be beat either. the only problem is, that i was working hard to set up the printer for 64-bit windows (windows 7). it was hard and i'm not a technology expert at all. but I found a wonderful site called ""andrews blog"" where the guy told me how to download the correct drivers and how to install them.overall this is the perfect choice if you're on a budget and looking for an economy-efficient all in one."
2,not good,"It looks very nice when i got this machine, and i almost want to share my thankfulness here, however, after a few months of using it, it is not as good as i think, actually, it is bad. the paper jam always. many times you can't print continuously, if you print 2 pages together, the 1st page will come out twice, you will never see the 2nd page, and you have to manually cancel it and print the 2nd page alone.the fax function is dull, it work around 50% of the time.the copy function is good, but you have to make copy one by one manually.the scan function is very good, i couldn't deny it.besides, somethings a black margin will appear in your printed pager.....i can't fix it"
2,No Paper Feeder For Fax Or Copy,"Cons: No Paper Feeder For Fax Or CopyThere are things which shouldn't be purchased online and this is one of them. The ad reads, prints and copies up to 21 pages a minute - sounds good and I only ""assumed"" there was a feeder in order to copy up to 21 pages a minute. Nope - 21 pages a minute is if you copy only one page and print 21.We intended to use it mostly as a fax and copier - not a printer. Well, it was for my dad and it was about 60 days later that he opened began to use the product and it's unlikely that amazon will allow me to return the printer.It's a good machine for receiving faxes and printing - just not for sending a fax with multiple pages or copying multiple pages."
1,save your money and buy something else,"This is a piece of crap. There is paper jam every single time that I print. The equipment broke easily. After a couple of weeks after purchasing this new printer, I kept having problems such as Error 100. It kept making copies in blank pages even with a new toner. Don't buy this item. Save your money for something better."
3,Would have been nice of them to include a USB Cable,Pretty good product but really aggravating when I was setting up and found out it doesn't come with a USB cable. The manual doesn't say anything about there being no USB cable so I thought maybe I had replaced it. Had to drive all the way over to the mall to buy a USB cable!
1,Not a dependable system.,"I purchased one of these at a Fry's Electronics, a little over a year later the printer image started to have ghosting vertically down the page. Fry's diagnosis was that the drum was already bad. Unfortunately the design is to include the toner and drum together making it a very expensive consumable. Especially since we had short use of it not even using 500 sheets of paper. My choices are now:A. Spend $40-50 on a ""remanufactured"" cartridge, refilled in a back alley (people auction empties on Ebay to feed this industry)B. Spend $80-90 on a Canon cartridge that might work for more than a year this timeC. Or spend $199 on the latest Canon Image class laser printer, with the same poor cartridge design.D. Never buy a Canon printer againLives up to what amounts to a disclaimer, ""Made in China""."
3,Received without the Cartridge,"This all in one printer is really great for the price but if you get all the parts from the seller as promised at the time of purchase. I did not find any cartridge in a box so I had to purchase a new cartridge from the Best Buy which cost me another $70. If I would have received it with the printer then it is value for money otherwise, you can find so many printers for the price that it cost me.If someone knows how can I get a refund from the seller for the cartridge price, please let me know."
3,"Good product,,, bad service","Now that I'm finally able to use the product, I'm happy with it. However, it came without a cable to link it to my computer. The extra $20 was an annoyance, but I could live with that. It was also missing part of the paper cassette and Canon would not make good on that. Had to pay an additional $20 for a part that should have come with the machine. Does not bode well for the quality of service I will be expecting from Canon in the future."
2,Went bad after 1 year,"Trashed it today morning. It was good for about one year or so, but then started printing wavy patterns and leaving a lot of black ink blotches on the paper. There seemed to be something mechanically wrong as it'd make very strange/whining sounds while copying/printing. Expected better quality from Canon."
1,Amazon again...,"Customer support is playing stupid and winning again...the price on this printer changed 2 times since i ordered mine 3 days ago...""can't do anything for you, we are just fulfilling the order for a third party, so we are not responsable""...duh, well done Amazon."
3,monster box,"Item can not be identified here. It is a a Canon image CLASS MF 3240sO FAR, IT HAS PERFORMED AS EXPECTED. tHE SIZE IS TOO BIG FOR MY SPAVE, HOWEVER."
5,Performance/Price is not BAD.,"I recommend this print. There is no regret. But, Have to place this on horizontal hard table! Otherwise occur jam. His big volume is not bad. I received this with free shippment! robust! But There is no USB cable in this product. So If you do not have it, You order this cable separately."
4,quick scanner/copier,"This multi-function does the job as advertised. quick copying, and scanning. Only minus would be the entire unit is a bit large, but other than that one issue, everything else works great. Very good quality printing. Plus you can't beat the price. An auto-doc feature would be nice, but since I fax very few documents it doesn't matter to myself.I 100% recommend the product as advertised."
5,Excellent for it's price!,"I purchased this machine for the copying and printing. It does an excellent job for both of these purposes. I have not tried the fax out or the scanning. It certainly has exceeded my expectations, and at this point I would recommend this printer to anyone!I owned a canon inkjet printer 15 years ago that lasted and printed very well for years. With this in mind, it influenced this purchase.At this point I am extremely satisfied and impressed with the print quality for copying and printing."
3,Good product for the price,"This is a good product for its price. I have not found any deficiencies so far in the features this machine offers.There are two major features (from my point of view) that this unit lucks:- automatic document feeder;- double-sided printing;For those of you who would like to have those features, I strongly recommend to consider another model, like Canon MF4150 for example (which btw costs only $40 more). If I could turn back time, I would definitely go for the MF4150."
4,Excellent printer for price,"I have owned this printer for several months and I am very happy with my purchase. I use it in my home office for general printing (it is fast), copying, scanning and fax.ProsInexpensive, fast printing, easy set-up, excellent copying (including enlargement & reduction) execllent scanning.ConsThe fax utility is hard to use for incoming faxes. The manual could be more helpful in this area. For example if you put on ""Manual"" what button(s) do I press when there is an incoming fax. This is not explained in the manual. I do not find the lack of a multipage feeder for the fax an issue. Irecently sent a 20 page document and scanned each one in turn, which stores the pages in memory and then fax the whole document. Works just fine. I can imagine this method being a pain for people who send multipage faxes on a regular basis, but for the casual use it works great."
1,once is jams you need to throw this piece of ****,"the paper after being lifted from tray, rotates twicethe roller inside has no access from sides or backmy paper jammed at inner one badly, trying to slowly pull the paper didnt help, it just tore the paperthere is no way to reach it, short of opening 20 screws and pulling entire printer apartWORST designcanon, what are you smoking? please share it with usI like canon products, but not this hooey"
3,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE,"There is no printer driver for the Mac. I traced this problem back to 2006. As such Canon will likely not release a driver for the Mac. Further, even though there is a driver for Windows OS, the driver is very difficult to install. The driver software either refuses to install because there is an ""existing driver"" (even though I don't have an existing driver) or it installs but doesn't work.However, the printing and photocopying is fast and clean. It has great functions although I would love a paper feeder. Even so, the printer runs great.In conclusion, I'd recommend this printer for non-Mac users. Keep in mind that this printer is not as user friendly as some others but the functionality of the printer makes this a great buy.NOTE: You can print from your Mac if you have bootcamp."
4,"Great printer and great copier, scanner is okay","I bought this to use as a printer and copier, and it's what i hoped to find. Copies are crisp and machine is fast. Bit noisy, i guess, but that doesn't bother me.The scanner is a bit convoluted, though it works. it could be a whole lot easier to use, and i thus far have found it impossible to scan with unless i use the computer to boot and operate the machine. As near as i can tell, the actual scan button is useless."
4,A Solid Choice,"I have had this multi-function for about one year. Its a solid choice for a basic, well-performing laser machine.Its very fast to print first page -- no long warm-up required.Drivers for Vista work fantastic."
4,A good product for home/ home office use,"This product is great for the price.Cons - noisy, no auto document feeder, not network enabledGood - printout quality, energy efficient, good software(it might take a while for you to explore all the features), value for moneyI already had a router with USB print server, hence networking is not an issue for me.Overall, if you are not looking to spend a lot of money but still want to own a multi function printer, this would be a good choice."
3,not an update CD for installation included,"The CD cannot be installed, have to download online, the CD included is out of date!!Still not work with Window Vista!For install with Window 7, have to call tech for help, becasue no way you can install yourslef, need a specail procedue."
1,not even fit for the dumpster,awesome scanner..but then i didnt pay the $100+ for the scanner only...intially it was printing fine.. then one day it decided to play jam --paper jam..by this time i had printed maybe 500-600 pages only..the original toner was still going strong..and soon after that it totally stopped printing..then one day it suddenly stopped jamming and worked fine for another 100 or so pages.. but this morning the jamming came back..and this time its worse..the moment paper leaves the tray the printer jams..Another issue with this is that canon doesnt really support this printer for the 64bits windows7 OS... Yet they are still selling it!!!
3,not bad for the price,"I purchased this all-in-one a few months ago...it worked great for the first month but...now I have issues with faxing (receiving) it is NOT user friendly when trying to receive a fax with an answering machine or even without...very difficult to understand how the receiving modes work and which one is the best for your phone set up...other than that the copy, scan, and print features are good with the exception of I wish it had a multiple page loading (u have to place 1 page at a time on the glass to scan or copy) so if you have several pages to fax or scan it takes a while. Other than that it is a decent buy."
4,Multifunctional,"Lotsa bang for the ol' buck. Performs all tasks quickly, quietly and easily for a very small price. Printing seems to be it's strong suit. I'm sure the faxing is functional. The scanning isn't of the highest quality I've ever seen but it works and seems fairly easy to integrate into other programs. For the price, as long as it's not defective or damaged in shipping, it should fill most home office needs."
1,Beware of this product if you have a 64 bit Vista operating system!,"Be forewarned: if you have a Vista 64 bit operating system, the scanning function will not work. I called Canon's tech support and was informed that they do not supply software that works with Vista 64 bit. The best they could do is suggest I try to find some software on the Internet. I find this to be rather outrageous."
2,Canon imageCLASS MF3240,"The printer did not came with any driver for 64-bit machine. The other problem was that there were no cord with the box, they cannot give a $5 cord for a $100 printer?"
4,great machine,i got sick of buying ink cartridges and then having them dry up before i use them so i switched to laser. machine working great so far. very happy.
5,Great value canon printer,"This printer ($89) is a great value for a laser printer. It produces excellent, crisp, high quality B&W; pages. However, it did not come with a driver for Windows 7, but I was able to download the correct driver after talking to the Canon support.A great value for an wired printer. Way more economical than an ink jet printer. The refill may be around $75 but it produces four times more pages than a $50 ink jet cartridge."
3,Not Mac Compatible,I bought this after I saw the great reviews on it. I neglected to investigate if it is Mac Compatible. Had to return it
4,Good MFP,"I am happy with the unit. All the functions work fine. I have connected it to a Sony Vaio and IBM TP both with XP, no problems. For the price ($160)I am very pleased. The only minor problem is the LCD panel is hard to see unless the light is just right."
3,"Huge, Broken","This is a mammoth device - taking up far more room than I expected. Once I got over that I was disappointed to find that the paper feeder jammed every 1-2 sheets. That and the fact that there was really no receiving tray for the printed material made it an easy decision to return it. Otherwise, the print looked good and the copies were quick. I'd love to have this printer smaller, working, with a paper receiving tray that actually kept printed documents organized and didn't spit them on the floor."
2,Not for office use,"When we set the unit up, I realized there is no multiple page feed for the fax. Do all of the other reviewers live in some bizarro world where they only send one page faxes? Well, it's a deal breaker to me. I guess I should have read the spec's a little closer. Also imortant, the machine did not pick up the incoming dedicated fax calls. Its going back before I mess around with that though. Why build a laser multifunction that you have to fax on a flatbed?"
3,Not completely Win 7 64 bit compatible,"I was told that this printer was compatible with the new Windows 7 64 bit operating system by Canon customer service. I would just need to download the print drivers and install from there. No problem. When I get the printer and try to set it up, I find out by another tech support person that although there are print drivers, there is no program to run the scanner (which scans in color even though it's a laser b/w printer.) I was told to ""google it"" and find 3rd party software to run the scanner feature. Sent it back asap. Amazon handled it with no issues. I had to upgrade one more level...MF4350d."
4,Good but unusable for Macs,"The printer has worked well. The only drawback is that there are no Mac drivers for it. I'm in an office setting with both PCs and Macs, so the Macs can't use this printer."
1,Infuriating Jam Machine,"I don't print often but when I do I can expect this printer to jam.All this thing ever does is Jam! About every other page it jams!I am using high quality 24lb xerox multi-purpose paper and get nothing but jams.I am shopping for a new printer so I can take this one to the woodshed like they do in ""Office Space""."
2,No Mac drivers available,"Ordered the printer before my wife went back to Mac OS. Works fine on our XP machines, but there appear to be no Macintosh drivers available. Whatsoever. Not even for just printing. Seriously, Canon?"
1,Difficult to use from the beginning.,"I have had this printer for a year and a half now. The printer was incredibly difficult to set up, none of the drivers are current, and Canon's online drivers only set up the printer function. If you were hoping to use the scanner and fax, I hope you're skilled with computers. During the first year the printer jammed often and the paper feeder often misfeeds the paper. In the last six months the actual printer has begun to fall apart. The plastic hinges for the front door have permanently disconnected (I have to hold the door in place manually while it prints). The paper tray also no longer shuts properly, but remains slightly agape.Avoid this printer."
3,worked well until I changed computers,This copier worked very well until I had to change computers. When I did so there were no longer any drivers available to install it.
4,I really like it except that it can not auto double-page print,I really like it except that it can not auto double-page print. I used it for two years and it works well. Quick and Silent.
3,Bit of a disappointment,"I bought this set of inserts for the Milescraft 1200 adapter base kit. I was disappointed that it did not include a wider variety of inserts, nor a replacement for the Porter-Cable adapter.I also thought they were a bit pricey considering they're all plastic (about the size of an old 45rpm record adaptor), and they came with no real guide or explanation as to the intended use/value of the various sizes to the purchaser.(Please note: The photo Amazon is using to illustrate this kit also shows the adaptor base plate. The base plate is NOT included with the inserts.)"
5,This Sports First Aid Kit would work just ...,"This Sports First Aid Kit would work just as well as an all-purpose kit. It's loaded with bandages, cold compresses, and things like scissors, tweezers, and vinyl gloves. A nice basic kit to keep in the house or car in case of minor emergencies."
5,The Sports First Aid Kit is a great ...,"The Sports First Aid Kit is a great first aid kit! My husband is a soccer coach and has been looking for a first-aid kit to have on hand at practice in case of injury. This one fits our needs exactly. It has 71 pieces, including an elastic bandage, cold packs, butterfly bandages, dressings, antiseptics, finger splints, gloves, and more. The case is sturdy and well-organized. The scissors are surgical steel, not plastic. I think this is a great item!"
4,insightful lyrics set to progressive world-beat rythm,"BOP(harvey) provides an acute social commentary on the world around us. To combine that with a uniquely eclectic combination of musical styles is an incredible feat for a group that hailed from the very homogenous suburbs of the midwest. If this doesn't get you moving and thinking, nothing will."
3,sigma is good for you,"I searched for Sigma books in the county library database, and this was one I put a hold on and read when it came in. This is useful as a quick, easy exposition of ""What is Six Sigma and why is it so great?"" if you don't know anything about it other than that your employer is keen on it. I can understand an employer passing this out to the masses to help counter skepticism and resistance to a nascent Sigma program. This book might persuade the reader to take his foot off the brake -- but there's nothing in here to help him start driving."
1,Don't Waste your Money,"The only good thing about this book is that it is easy to read and only takes a couple of hours to read it. (Probably as long as the author took to write it). Proclaimed as Six Sigma's version of ""The Goal"", it bares no comparison either as a novel or as an introduction to the ideas of Six Sigma. Three pages at the end of the book summarise the little that is covered. There are far better books on Six Sigma available. I don't recommend you buy this one."
4,A good introductory reading about six sigma,"This is a very good, concise and interesting book introducing the concept of six sigma.The author wisely used a more interesting approach of fictionalized tale to introduce the very academic, sometimes boring, but very useful methodology of six sigma (though the story itself is not very interesting). Readers can acquire the basic concept of six sigma within couple of hours (of course, you can't expect an in-depth study of six sigma within several hours) and then they start thinking carefully about this revolutionary methodology and start looking for further materials about six sigma available in the market.Particularly, I like the author used a very funny phrase for the five-step process of implementing six sigma ""Dumb Managers Always Ignore Customers"" (DMAIC - Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control). I definitely won't forget it."
3,A good primer,"So many books about this topic are dry and formulaic. In the style of Who Stole My Cheese, this book allows the reader to understand the basics of this approach to better business without drowning him in detail. This book gives just enough to allow one to understand a conversation on the topic and to decide whether or not to pursue more technical reading or outside assistance.This is a quick read and worth the time."
4,The Power of Six Sigma,"I just completed this book, it's a great book to learn just ""What is Six Sigma"" on an elementary level. I learned alot from it, the underlying factor is ""if"" Top Management buys into the process and keeps the process on the front burner. I will work, but it's a long process, not one you can do in 2 weeks.My company has just started the Six Sigma process and I don't feel that it's gotten down to Middle Mgmt. as of yet, but I strongly recommend this book to learn the Six Sigma way."
4,Sigma Six Only Works When EVERYONE buys in,"Good book outlining a good program. I'm actually a Sigma Six admirer, but it's one of those things everyone has to buy into, not just upper management. It only takes a few week points to render it ineffective."
2,Story,"I thought the book was going to explain some details about this concept. However, it just tells you a story about what six-sigma means and what it does. It is not technical at all. After reading this book, you won't be able to implement this concept but you will know what it is. Just a story book."
5,A great primer on Six Sigma,"OK, so the first book I bought was ""Six Sigma, The Breakthrough Management Strategy..."" and I barely got through half of it. They pretty much sold me on the idea that it was an effective program, but did a poor job explaining what Six Sigma is and how to apply it.""The Power of Six Sigma"", however, is a great introduction to Six Sigma. It's a quick and easy read that gives you a clear idea of what Six Sigma is and how it can help an organization. Better yet, the final chapters give an example of a Six Sigma program being implemented.When I first heard that it was written as a conversation between 2 friends, I sort of cringed. But I was surprised to find that the book flowed very well, contained lots of information and didn't overdo it on the ""fluffy"" conversation.Now, this will not make you an expert on Six Sigma, but it is an excellent starting point and gives you a clear answer to the question ""What is Six Sigma and how can it be implimented?"""
2,Who Moved My Sigma?,"Yes, this book discusses basic concepts of Six Sigma; it also presents Six Sigma in ""conversational language""; and its a fun read. Chowdhury's work is probably most useful to those companies that have adopted a compensatory system that mimics the example in the book. Distributing this book to a mass audience at a company that does not provide the same reward structure will likely act as a negative to those who read it (or at least confuse them). If this book were to be re-written in response to this critisizm it would become the best-seller it wants to be. Wait for a re-write or a sequel."
1,Did I read the same book?,"I have a different perspective than most of the reviewers... my company is not implementing Six Sigma - I just wanted to learn more about it. It's about 120 pages, consisting of about 5 pages of good information (you can read the last 5 pages to get this) & 115 pages of the cheesiest, forced dialog. I really felt like someone was trying to sell me a used car. Worth a quick read because you got it free at your company - definitely. But, I definitely wouldn't recommend this as a purchase."
4,"Great book, even better concept...","The Servant Leader has a great title and develops the concept. It only falls short in giving true-to-life, concrete examples. If you are new to the concept of servant leadership, this is a great starter. Great book!"
4,Practical application advice,This book was pleasantly easy to read and had very practical application tips for Servant Leader practitioners.
4,Servant Leader,"I should have written this book. The principles in this book contain the principles by which I have always tried to operate my manufacturing company. After I finding the book and reading it for myself, I bought copies for my key employees and we did a book study together to reinforce our commitment to being a servant leader company to our other employees and our customers."
3,SERVANT LEADER,THIS BOOK IS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING. IT START OUT GREAT THEN IT WANDERS INTO MOSTLY IRRELEVANT BUSINESS EXPERIENCES OF AUTRY. BUT THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS DO DEFINE WHAT A SERVNT LEADER IS AND DOES.
2,You get what you paid for...,"So you know how you may do a load of laundry and forget the clothes are in the dryer, and the next day you take them out and they are full of wrinkles? Well these sheets magically do that without the next day wait. I washed the sheets and took them directly out of the dryer and they were completely full of wrinkles. As well they claim to be Sateen, they aren't like any sateen sheets I've had before and nowhere on the packaging label does it claim to be sateen. Also I know everyone may have their own colour scheme, but these sheets are NOT ivory, more of an ecru - there's a difference. But King Size sheets for $20 - hey you can't beat the price."
2,Save your money,"After receiving my order from Amazon and running these sheets through the wash, I had high hopes. However, I soon realized that sleeping on these was slightly better than sleeping on a fire ant hill and slightly worse than sleeping inside a burlap sack. I have slept on 200 count Walmart sheets that are more comfortable. On a positive note, the sheets do fit my king bed comfortably. Maybe these things will soften up over a few washes, but I am not counting on it."
2,too heavy,I take care of horses and work in mud. Boots serve the purpose but are much to heavy and stiff.
2,Boss men's black boots,"The boots are very thin and do not stand up. They bend over in the middle, thus making them hard to put on. I expected far thicker material on the upper boot. I am not using them and will probably donate them to a local senior services thrift store."
3,Some interesting stories,"""Cold Hand in Mine may not be Aickman's best, yet it contains one excellent story: ""The Hospice"". Nothing is explained, all is guessable about what is transpiring when a traveller unexpectedly find himself in a quasi-hotel, where,fed an incredible amount of food he does not actually want, he notices the odd deportment of the guests. He is awoken by a scream in the night: someone has died, and he, next morning, departs (living) with the hearse. It is surprising that he leaves at all. It is possible that ""The Hospice"" is a half-way house between the living and the dead. But one imagines Aickman would have, if asked, refused to commit himself in order to let the reader decide."
2,why not tell us there are nails to go into marble shower?,"These soap dishes looked lovely and just right, however when they arrived, they had nails that had to be drilled into a marble shower.. now possible..the picture and desriptions was not adequate and it is not worth it to return them since there is no free return and there is a restocking charge.. too bad.. last time i buy form them!"
5,Very Sturdy Straight Edge,"I can't imagine how I could break this thing! Very sturdy, and I ordered a 48"" because when cutting 4x8' sheets of wood, a yard stick doesn't cut it."
2,"Review of book: Diary: Clarkson Butterworth, born 1826, died 1916.","This book is an exact copy of a diary in the author's own handwriting most of which is not readable because his handwriting was extremely tiny and the pages did not copy well. If you are going to sell a book at a considerable price it should above all else be readable and most of this book is not. To add insult to injury, the diary only covers a few years in the late 1880's when the author is old and does not cover any of the author's life growing up. The book is heavy and cumbersome because they only copied on one side of a page leaving one side of each page blank. The sloppy way this book was thrown together by the publishers is an insult to those who purchase it."
5,just as expected,The manual is just as good as the rest of Haynes manuals. complete and with complete information. I would surely recommend this purchase.
5,A reliable choice,"It is a pity that at the time of writing this review there is no picture of the book available on amazon.com (you will have to take a peek at amazon.co.uk for this) nor the glook insideh option, because this book is not only wonderful to look at - the recipes are wonderful to match. From scones to lemon meringue pie, there are mouth-watering pictures of each recipe, which has clear instructions with further pictures to show key stages of the preparation process. Furthermore, all the recipes I have tried have worked perfectly. For people who are looking for a good baking book covering a broad range of traditional recipes for cakes, cookies and breads, this is an excellent choice."
1,Little Red wagon,Little is the right word. The reviews of this toy were either wrong or misleading. One person spoke of their child pulling his toys around in it. This wagon is only about 6 inches long. The only thing you could pull would be a hot wheel car!! There were no dimensions on the description. Very disappointed. I ordered an 18 inch one from Buddy L for less money!
1,Very Poor,"I have never been so disappointed in a product ordered from Amazon before. In making a choice as to which ""movie"" to purchase I thought this would provide a little more authenticity. No where in the purchase information was it disclosed that this was a musical play. I would really like to send this product back and get my money back. The students hated it and made fun of it so I stopped showing it. I use movies as an addition to novels that we read in class and this was a HUGE disappointment."
1,Cornball,It is a video production of a staged musical based on a play which is based on the book. It is cheesy.
1,Remote doesn't work...,"The player itself works/plays fine, but the remote control doesn't work. (Actually, one button ""works"" but it activates the wrong control.)I now live outside the US, so returning the item isn't a practical option. Buyer beware!"
5,Easy to install and work great! I can see out my windshield!,"The original factory wipers for my 2009 Honda Civic were starting to wear and streak, so I did some research on the best replacements and came upon the PIAA's, which were well-reviewed and appeared easy to install. I didn't want to just replace the blades, but the whole wiper.Installation was a breeze, took less than 5 minutes total for both wipers. Just make sure you use the proper bracket for your wiper arm that comes with the wipers. Mine were the J-hooks that snapped right in. The directions tell you to completely clean the windshield with soap and water, then run the wipers dry for about 15 minutes to fully apply the sealant/coating. I ran mine for about 5 minutes, so I can't really tell if enough coating was there.So far so good, I've had these for over a month now, we have had ice/snow/rain and I've been impressed with the wipers. They clear all the rain drops and the slushy mess just glide right off in one clean swipe."
3,Bloodfist turns into a prison picture....,"Though there is a ""III"" in the title, this sequel is totally unrelated to the first to pictures. This film was originally made as ""Force to Fight"" but was retitled to part of the Bloodfist series when it was released video (Yes, believe it or not this baby was theatrically released). This time we get Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson being wrongfully accused of a crime and being sent to prison and is ""forced to fight"" in order to say alive, much like the Van Damne picture Death Warrent. Not a terrible low budget action outing, but far from the best in the overly long series."
2,NOT A TRUE SEQUEL TO THE 1ST 2 MOVIES; 2.5 STARS,"IN THIS UNRELATED CHAPTER OF THE ''BLOODFIST'' SERIES, A PENETENTIARY INMATE [DON ''THE DRAGON'' WILSON] MUST FIGHT FOR HIS LIFE INSIDE CELLBLOCK C. BENEFITS LARGELY FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE ORIGINAL SHAFT HIMSELF RICHARD ROUNDTREE, WHO PLAYS AN INMATE NAMED STARKS IN THIS MOVIE. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS JUST YOUR AVERAGE PRISON MOVIE THAT HAPPENS TO HAVE SOME MARTIAL ARTS IN IT. ''DEATH WARRANT'' DID THIS A LITTLE BETTER."
2,yikes!!!,"if you're watching the bloodfist series in order then you're in for a very nasty surprise when you hit number 3. gone is the charm and fun of the first 2 and in its place is a hard hitting relatively speaking)prison drama covering male rape, paedophilia, race relations (or rather lack of). don the dragon has become ultra invincible so all his fights lost any interest for me. he's beefed up a lot for this role as well. i preferred the first 2."
3,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,"First of all in my opinion; Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is a brilliant fighter. I have seen some of his actual fights and he's just as good in the ring as well as on camera. This movie doesn't continue from the first and second volume of bloodfist although it has the same title name but the character has a different name. The main thing is that the fight scenes are just as good as the first two. My favourite fight scene is when he matched up with Stan 'the man' Longinidis an australian and Kickboxing Legend. Bloodfist 1,2 & 3 are far better than the rest of the bloodfist series."
4,Just a great album,"This is the 21st time to buy this album. It never fails that someone takes it after hearing it, nice it was the detail guy."
1,Essential Classic Techno Collection,"This comp is the best of early techno,Human Resource's Dominator is reason enough to buy this, but also one of Prodigy's first tracks ever, ""g-force"", is also included here, Istononik's ,Different Stokes"" is classic underground hardcore,(later remixed by TEN CITY records ,as a deep house track) This is a great compilation that makes me long for the old skool days of JNCOs, warehouse parties and 3 day campouts and real PLUR, and did I mention UTAH SAINTS!!!!!CLASSIC, Deejay Junior Griggs aka Dj Gyro (humblemumbledj@hotmail.com)"
4,At last - a sensible book for the naturally psychic,"A Season of Sorcery reads as a biography of Palin's life. Using her own experiences she takes us on a journey towards coming to terms with being naturally psychic. Anyone with clairvoyant or mediumistic abilities will both empathise with Palin and breathe a huge sigh of relief as they hear and recognise the strange things that she has dealt with and realise that they are not alone in their experiences. Anyone who is perhaps not as gifted will read on in amazement at the true story of her unusual life.This book deals with all that is paranormal, including past lives, spirits, meditation, and even alien encounters. However, it deals with it in a very matter of fact, unsensationalist way. Which is exactly what a person coming into their own power needs to hear.I applaud Palin for discussing her life, and risking her uniqueness being labelled the rantings of a eccentric. They are not. They are extremely useful and fascinating."
2,Capitalizing on the Good Stuff,"Recently I received my long awaited copy of ""Jamarama - Live"", what a rip off! Much can be said about the amateurish production of the DVD. Despite the fact it was a live event, focusing and tracking for this DVD seems to have been a lost art.Yet, the worst part of this recording is hype used to promote DVD. Laurie Berkner who by the time of the issuance of this recording was an established star of the pre-school set was presented as the principal artist. Well if principal artist means doing two songs which she had better recorded on her own much heralded DVD then ok. The rest of tracks and their attendant artist can best be summed up with one word, boring.I won't belabor my criticism of this DVD. I'll end by saying save your money."
2,captures my todder's attention...barely,Well...We love Laurie Berkner and Milkshake is great too....but the Ohmies really ruin the dvd. I fast forward over their performances. The sound quality is not great either. Seems to be amatur-ish. Laurie's dvd is so much better!!
1,Save your money,"Thankfully, I read the reviews of this video before buying it. We checked it out from the library instead. At least it was free. The sound and picture quality is awful, and Laurie Berkner really needed top billing over the other two groups who are not even close to her in talent."
2,Not as exciting as we expected.,"Poor audio. Performances were unispired. Milkshake does a credible job, Laurie Berkner seems to mail it in, and the only reason to watch the Ohmies is a out of shear Schadenfreude."
2,"Good for kids, bad for the parents","When I first watched this DVD, I couldn't believe that they actually went ahead with selling it after hearing the poor sound quality from the live recording. Laurie Berkner is the only one who sings in tune, so it is very difficult for the adults to get through it. However, I have to give it a few stars since it is the only DVD that I play where my son will sit through the entire thing, even if I leave the room!"
3,We like the Ohmies!,"The video could be better...sound quality, camera angles. Overall, we enjoyed all of the acts though...a great spectrum of the talent out there to help teach and entertain kids and adults. Too bad so many people didn't enjoy the Ohmies. I suggest people check out the Ohmies' ""Surprise the Sun"" DVD or, better yet, go see their complete live show if you're in the LA area...FANTASTIC! Penny's voice can be a little annoying at times, but the others in the cast make up for it!"
3,So-so,I may have misread the ad but I thought this was a full dvd of Laurie Berkner. The seller was very easy to deal with and it was really my own mistake of not reading more of what the dvd was about.
2,The Ohmies suck!,"I bought this dvd, like many other parents because I thought The Laurie Berkner Band and Milkshake were headlining. Instead we get mostly The Ohmies: saccarin-sweet boring music. My child left the room after about 5 minutes into it. There's a reason I've never seen this band on Noggin-they're terrible! I agree with many other reviewers that the sound quality was not great and there were only maybe 2 songs of Laurie and 3 of Milkshake. If this show were playing close by I would never go to see it. Save your money and get Jack's Big Music show on DVD or We are the Laurie Berkner Band."
2,Not Great,"My toddler is not very interested in this. He loves music by the individual bands, but this DVD has the same songs that are on their individual DVDs, so not worth the money."
3,Pretty Good,"Jasper's second effort, Dakota Grand, while a better offering than his debut, Dark, still does not possess that ""wow"" factor. The writing style showed more depth and the story was more developed, but it was still just your run-of-the-mill novel. Worth a read, not a purchase."
2,Don't waste your money,"This CD might be a decent investment for totally hardcore Therion fans, but really, and especially if you're new to this type of music, it's best to just stick with Therion. This disc almost doesnt deserve the two stars I've given it. There may be some talent shown on this disc, but honestly, unless you think its cool to buy a CD filled mostly with 1 to 2 minute space fillers, then this is a wate of your money. Initially the CD is almost impressive and even slightly interesting, but as time has gone by, not that much time really though, this sorry excuse for an album has shown its true colors. The bands previous release is far better based on songwriting, but the production is really quite dismal. If you were going to buy on of this bands releases, I would definitely say don't go anywhere near this one. It's terribly boring and an utter waste of money."
2,Not bad... for what it is. But ultimately junk,"I give it 2 stars because the music and arrangements are above-average for the genre (Euro-Metal?). However, the individuals behind The Haggard don't actually play the instruments! The biggest problem here is the absolutely ridiculous vocals. Please...the 'roaring like a monster' is just SO BAD and so *SILLY*. This CD begins with some promising music & drama but quickly descends into some kind of cheap adolescent nightmare. I could have given it 4 stars if they avoided such obvious marketing gimmicks. Pass this one by."
5,Great cd,"This is an awsome cd. Hard to find but was very reasonable on here. It was a used cd, but looked new when taken out of the case. Great cd though, I recommend chapter three."
1,Horrible Condition,"Although i enjoyed reading this novel, I was disappointed when it arrived with writing all over the cover, and half of it's pages folded in on itself. This novel came to me in horrible condition, even though the seller placed this novel under ""great quality."""
5,This is an exellent book for kids 10 and up.,"This is a story about Constance. She came to America on the Mayflower and this is a diary of her life from first setting foot on the beach,to getting married in her last entry. This book takes you through the trials and tribulations of an average american girls life. You will find yourself relating to many,many situations that take place in this book. If it is not on the best seller chart it should be! This is a one of a kind book! Very highly recomended! It deserves five and a half stars!"
4,Just awesome and smart,"This is the perfect mouse for a notebook computer on the go, or even at home. First it's not wireless, so you never have to worry about batteries dying. Second the cord has a place to wrap around the mouse (where you can't see it), and the usb part pops into the bottom, making sure the cord is never a hassel during traveling. I can't believe there are not more mouses with this feature. Third it's not ultra small, but just right for travel and hand comfort.The only thing that keep me from giving it five stars is two things. First no back button, or in other words a third button. The back button saves so much times while browsing the web, i can't believe they don't have it on here. Third, when I bought it, I thought it automatically retracked, like a measuring tape, I was a little disappointed, but i'm sure they'll make something like that in the future.But right now I think it's the best you can get."
3,Cost? and Quality,"I've owned several of these mice, they are great for travel. However two issues: eventually the wrapping cable develops issues and either stops working completely or becomes intermittent. Also, how can this company be charging nearly $60 for a mouse that has always been under $20? Did they gold plate it or something?"
2,Stop working in 6 month,"The mouse was great until it stop working last week. The cable just get internally broken, and now is useless. I'm now change to a wireless mouse."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"We should have stopped the game the minute we opened the box and attempted to read the muddled instructions. There really is no point to the game. In addition it is incredibly confusing, to both the children and adults. Honestly, this could possibly be the absolute worst choice of any board game available on this site."
4,Sword of Truth series,"I think this book is really a classic, however, I think that the series just went on longer than it needed to. I lost interest after about number 7."
1,Is this the same series?,"Just finished this one. Took me over 3 weeks, and I read the first book in the series in 2 days -- does that tell you anything?It'd been so long since I started this series, that I wondered if possibly my memory was bad and Goodkind really was just a mediocre author. Turns out, the first books really WERE good, and this one really WAS pretty much worthless.Aaagh, I'm poisoned, but I'll drink anything that *anyone* hands me, as long as they call it an antidote. Doggone, if I'd just eaten that Big Mac, my gift woulda functioned at the BEGINNING of the book! Love, love, love -- and a goat.Maybe it was allegorical, as reading this book was about the same as slowly dying of poison...Can someone please write a KICKIN' fantasy series and wrap it up in less than a decalogy???!!! George R.R. Martin, don't let me down!"
4,Kept my attention,"I agree with another review I read. I don't know what everyone's beef is either. I personally loved the book. As with the previous 7 (and ""Debt of Bones""), I couldn't put it down.It does get political at times and a bit preachy, but it's necessary to the story. Did anyone read ""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair? He was political and preachy, but that didn't stop his book from becoming a staple in modern high schools! Plus, it's interesting to see someone else's views, even if you don't agree with them (as was my case with Sinclair).I can't wait for the next book!"
4,Good but not the Best,"This was overall a good Sword of truth book. On the most part it took way to long to get into the real action but when it did it was great. THE MAJOR COMPLAINT I HAVE is the story was soooo damn preachy. How many time can i read a lecture in a book about ""your life is your own to live"" its INSANE, I read a book to be entertained not lectured to. If you can get past the preachyness of the book its pretty good but repetitive."
4,Oh please...,"I read many of the other reviews. They have alot of ideas going for them, but they should read past what's obvious. For one, ""The banished"" might have a key role in the next book, while he tried to make things interesting...somethings don't go as planned. It was a very nice book. It kept me entertained. I may be 14, but you have to look at other things as well. Many of the points in this book can trigger a future event, possibley causing one of the best books he's writen.He goes into a lot of detail. If you've ever read the first part of Tolkien's ""The Fellowship of the Ring""...He does around 50 pages of introduction, so he doesn't have to do it later. ""The Naked Empire"" is a good book. I recommend people to read it if you enjoy the Sword of Truth Series. It might be a key part in the next book."
1,Perhaps the worst book in the series,"The only thing I can come up with is that Goodkind must be trying to sabotage his own series... unless you _must_ read the entire series, I suggest you pass on this one. The characters that we know and love are neutered from their previous incarnations, and unless he's got some miracle plan worked out, I fail to see how this contributes to the storyline (at least the other books were exciting). Goodkind's preachy, but this book is like an 800-page gospel."
1,I may not read anymore of this series.,"I enjoyed the earlier books in this series. This book however, took me three starts before I was able to read through it. It was very low on plot and character development. The story took a back seat to political views."
1,Plot or not?,Did you read the inside flap and find yourself disappointed when an outtake from the book was given and not a plot summary? That's because there was no plot...well...no new plot.
4,Excellent book...but to preachy.,"I overall really enjoyed this book its picked up right where the last one left off. Richard is having probems with his gift again he must figure out what is wrong with it not only to save him self but an empire that had been shut off from the world for centuries.Zedd and Adies parts in this book are also very entertaining i wont explain much cause that would kinda ruin it but its very good.Nathan,Ann,Varna, and of course the D'Haran army also are in this book but only for a few chapters and only Ann and Nathan have any signifigant role in this books main story.Overall i would have given this book a 5 but the preachyness of Richard kinda of annoyed me so i only gave it a 4. Still a must buy book though."
5,Great Book,"Wonderful book. Great character development in the series overall, and further in this outing. As to the opinion that TG wrote this book to expound upon the Iraq war, I say RUBBISH. Many writers have put there personal thoughts in an allegorical manner. I thought his book made sense, and put down ideas that are as valid today as they were in yesteryear."
4,"Better than most, not as good as some","First things first, All of you liberal CRITICS are just mad because Goodkind debunked every ideal you hold dear, in ONE BOOK. If it makes you liberals mad enough to tell people to drop the series entirely, then I say, Goodkind has done a FANTASTIC job. Now on to the book.I read this book, in a total of 10 hours. This series is among the best, and with the latest addition to the WoT series :( has moved into 1st as my favorite series. That all said, the book did lack a few things. I think he needs to spend more time proving that idiot liberals are just that, stupid, mindless drones following whatever thier leaders say, and eating up drivel from the likes of Michael Moore as if it were gospel. Too bad you folks weren't born with a brain."
1,Worst book ever?,"A horrible book that did nothing to advance the story in the series. By the end of he book the characters are at the exact same spot they were at in the beginning. If you are reading the series, feel free to skip this book and you won't miss anything."
1,Objectivist Tripe,"Terry Goodkind was (and I emphasize was) one of the greatest fantasy writers of this day. He did not lose the focus of his storyline in fantastic races, magical spells, or sweeping godlike powers.Now, though, his books have become lost in the extreme and uncompromising conservative philosophy of Mr. Goodkind. Richard is no longer a hero, or even a human character. He is, in every sense of the word, an fanatic. Goodkind no longer has his characters smile, or laugh, or even talk. Now, the book is about the evils of communism, of civil disobience, and of idealism.I thought this book was not worth the paper it was printed on, which served no other role than to voice a much more poorly written version of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged."
1,Not This Time. I Quit.,After reading about two or three reviews for this book I made a very easy decision. I will not invest any more money or time into this series. I started to struggle with this series somewhere around book four. The series has gotten progressively worse. I fear that a trend (yes...Jordan too) may be developing to stretch a series out to maximize the economic benefits. If enough people refuse to finish a substandard series maybe the consumers can send their own potent message.
2,Milking it to meet the contract...,"I'll start by saying I absolutely loved the first four books of this series. The last four books seem only to be filler to meet the quota contracted with the publisher for the series. I have to say I am getting more and more disappointed with the way things are going with this series. For those of you who are new to SOT, my recommendation would be to read the first four books and then wait for the last one to be published so you can have closure. My only hope is that George R. R. Martin doesn't go down this path with his ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series - which, in my humble opinion, is an EXCELLENT read."
5,Excellent,Short and Sweet- At least a good author keeps on writing. For his fans this will not be a let down. When's the next one coming out?
3,"Good Read, Bad Condition","The book itself was an awesome read, if you 've already made it this far, its definitely worth it to keep going. On the flip side, the condition of the book when I received it was far less than the like new condition that was stated. Thoroughly disappointed by that fact."
