3,Doesn't work on track,"We got this train for our 2 year old for christmas this year. She was so excited and wanted to play with it right away. I was really disappointed to find out that the train doesn't like to make the turns on the track. As soon as it hit a corner the train came off the track. I put the track on a harder, flatter surface and the same thing happened. Luckily, the train can be used without the track, and that has been a lifesaver."
2,Animal sounds don't work after two months of play,"This was a fun and very portable toy for my 18-month-old son. Unfortunately, the elephant noise quit working after about 6 weeks of play, and then the monkey noise stopped working about 2 weeks later. Also, the train easily comes off the track, but my son loves playing with the train that way, too. He's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$!!! SERIOUSLY!!!,"I am a big fan of tike as well and thought that this set would be perfect first train for my daughter who is 22 months and later my baby who is now 5 months... Also before I made the decision of buying this, not only I looked around, but also read the reviews and bought it based on the ratings of this product.Tikes has the reputation of making toys targeted to toddlers, but this thing is boring, DOES come off the rails when making the turn, we have to keep putting it back; you try to put the driver and the train just goes off; and to make it worst it stops after one round, so that when the kids are getting the hang of it and are ready to watch, it has to be started again... The only good thing is that it is portable by just folding it, and that is what I am doing: I am folding it and taking this thing back to where it came from..."
3,It's ok,"We received this as a gift when our son turned 1. It was too frustrating at first. He's now 2 and loves the animals, but the train keeps coming off the track. I've folded it a few times, and it's made noises like it's going to snap apart one of these times. Like I said, I've only folded it a few times. Now that it has been folded a few times, the train falls off the track even more. At least my son is 2 now and can put the train back on the track by himself (or just let it keep going on the hard floor). It's ok, but I wouldn't have gotten it myself."
1,Train cannot stay on track for even a few seconds!,"I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option. When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going, it can't even make one corner turn without coming off the track! The train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track. This is very frustrating for my kids and I cannot believe they even put this on the market? You can't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it. I am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is.We wanted this toy for portability. Our kids also have the GeoTrax Working Railway, which is awesome, but not as portable."
2,train falls off the tracks,"We bought my son this as his first train toy when he was 14 months old. It held his interest a bit, but, I found it frustrating that it fell off the track a lot (even just out of the box). We've gotten other trains since, as we've discovered he has a great love of trains. GeoTrax from Fisher Price is a good one. As I buy more toys over the years, I've also discovered that sometimes Little Tykes subsidiaries do not live up to their name (I have a Little Tykes Piano that broke in 1 month and even the replacement they sent is not great)."
1,"Cute idea, terrible train set","This thing is junk. It looks cute and our son was very excited when he received it for Christmas, but we quickly learned we had wasted our money. The battery compartment has never fit very well, even after screwing it down as tight as we could. So it constantly shorts out and has just gotten worse over time. When my son actually does get it on the track right (which is NOT as easy as it should be for a toddler toy!)the stupid thing just derails at a turn. The figures don't stay on well, the stickers are already peeling off and the orange roof pops off the little building at the slightest touch. It doesn't even fold up easy and is hard to lay back out after it has been folded. Overall it is very disappointing, especially for a little tikes toy."
3,Not too sure.....,Gave this to my kiddos when they were two. The train has a hard time staying on the track...it has to line up exactly on the tracks or it does not run. I don't find it to be very interactive. My two like to put the train on the floor and watch it go. I think they were a bit too old to actually enjoy it. I love Little Tikes things but this is my least favorite product for sure.Positives are that it does fold up and go with all parts attached to it. The track is also one piece which is nice to put on the tabletop and not have a zillion track pieces.
1,Let down by Little Tikes,"I purchased this train set for my 1 1/2 year old nephew but I let my 4 1/2 year old daughter ""test"" it first and boy am I glad I did. The only positive this toy has is the fold and go feature and I'm not even sure how long that would hold up. As soon as we took it out of the box and unfolded the tracks the plastic had severe markings on the plastic from the stress of being folded and unfolded. When we put the train on the tracks and turned it on the train kept coming off the tracks and my 4 1/2 year old had trouble getting it back on track. There is no way a 1 1/2 year old could do it. Very frustrating and not a play alone toy."
5,Little Tikes Fold Up & Go Train Set,"Grandson loved this, and his parents loved the fact that it could fold up so easily and be put away"
3,"Good for the ""Old Time Radio"" crowd","...at first, wasn't impressed. But, it has really grown on me. It's a piece of history and I tend to get reflective at Christmas. So this fits the bill.If you like Old Time Radio, as I do, this is good find. Yes, it's low fi but it really catches the spirit of meloncoly (sp?) of Christmas during WWII."
2,Nothing Special,"I do not find this British folk group from the 60's interesting or original at all. Their vocal harmonies emulated American Folk groups such as Peter, Paul & Mary, Brothers Four, and Kingston Trio, and their guitar playings utilized primarily Merle Travis' finger-picking style. In such songs like The Times They Are A-Changing, Mr Tambourine Man, Girl from the North Country, It Ain't Me Babe, the male lead did a poor clone study of Bob Dylan. I would have given this CD three stars if the sound engineer did a better job in remastering the sound. For Americans who are interested in original-sounding British Folk music from the same era, I strongly recommend groups like the Pentangles, Fairport Convention, Magna Carta, Amazing Blondel, and Gryphon."
5,Music,It is great came in on time an itnis in great condition I cannot tell from new. Prefer from them again.
3,average,"Mike Ink and Joerg Burger collaborated on this release. The results are minimal, affected trance-house. It's nice but not anything overly special. More worthwhile is the Gas project from Wolfgang Voigt (Mike Ink)."
2,Outdated,"This copy of this book was written in 1988. The examples are very, very dated. I am disappointed that this was not an updated version of the book."
3,Dated,"I've read all the other books in this series. Usually, these books have insightful information about a child's developmental stages. This book tries to do the same; however, I think that the authors grouped too many age groups together. There's a BIG difference between ten-year olds and fourteen-year olds. Much of the information seemed dated (it was from the 1970s)."
1,Not Difficult,"These puzzles may be difficult if you are just starting sudoku, but if you have any experience, these are all pretty easy. They are definitely NOT difficult puzzles. I am solving them on an average of 5 minutes each, with no hesitation as I put in every number. Second edition, with orange cover, has same easy puzzles. This book is not a challenge for any experienced sudoku fan."
3,Pins to close,The pins to hang your ties on are a little to close. If you pull off one tie another one comes too.
1,Watch out!,"My comments have nothing to do with music, only production. I have received, and returned, two sets of these for an inexcusable manufacturing defect. In both sets, the disk that said it contains symphonies 4 & 5 actually contains 1 & 2. The label was misprinted. How many more sets are out there like this? How many returns will it take to get a correct one from Amazon? Shame on DG!"
5,Bernstein's best Mahler cycle,"These performances are from the early to mid 1970's and, in my opinion, is Bernstein's best Mahler cycle, combining the energy and drive of his pioneering 1960's cycle with added nuance and interpretive depth and more beautiful orchestral playing from the Vienna Phil, but without the overly studied, self conscious and mannered qualities that I think mars a lot of his 1980's cycle. All of these performances are in fine stereo sound, the video is in good color (albeit not as sharply defined as a modern production), which gives you the added bonus of seeing Bernstein's highly expressive and communicative conducting style. A must for both music lovers and Mahlerians."
3,SYMPHONIES 7-8 DUPLICATED TWICE!!,"Of course we all know that this is one of the monumental compilations of classical music ever made- however, after purchasing this set BRAND NEW, I was very disappointed to find that instead of receiving symphonies 9-10..I instead received symphonies 7-8 again, inside the case marked 9-10!! Very amateurish mistake, I must admit!!..so..instead of having to jump through 1000 hoops to try and get this problem rectified(see the buyer who had to pay shipping to Germany), I am seriously considering just buying the two missing symphonies..then perhaps I can die in peace with a minimum of hassle...."
1,"Defective product, defective customer service","Like a previous reviewer, the set I purchased is defective. The disc labeled 4 and 5 plays 1 and 2. Despite lengthy correspondence dating from April 06 with Deutsche Grammophone, they have not sent me a replacement. Needless to say, I have not bought a DG product since and may never again. A shame, since I had my eye on the Karajan Beethoven DVD set. I had the impression that DG had a high reputation for quality despite high prices. I am dissapointed to learn that only the latter is true."
5,Bernstein Conducts Mahler,The set of Dvd's are of phenomenal quality both in terms of video and audio. It's amazing to watch the faces of the members of the orchestra and see a front view of the Bernstein as he conducted. This set is highly recommended to serious lovers of Mahler.
5,Wonderful Help,"How to Solve Our Human Problems is one of those books that is amazing to stumble across. One day, even though I did not think I was angry about anything, I read this book with close attention - not like a novel. Then I recognized that maybe my unhappy day had something to do with what I was thinking about - what someone else had done to me. Then I tried some of the suggestions in the book. And guess what? Not only did it make perfect sense, but I began to see a difference in how I felt. I got quick relief from my uncomfortable mind. And isn't that what we all want anyway? If happiness and unhappiness both come from my mind - not from what someone else said or did, why not attempt to change my mind? Reading this book and trying some of the methods presented in it has changed my life for the better. Because of that, this book is priceless."
5,Good Life Examples and Reference Guide,"This little book, a brief 171 pages, lives up to its title ""How to Solve Our Human Problems"", and is a good guide for anyone wishing to see how real life situations pertain to the spiritual path, specifically the Buddhist way of The Four Noble Truths. As with all of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's writings, the text is clear and consise and easy to digest and then put into practice. The examples given in the book are practical and help provide a better understanding of how to handle common situations, especially problems of anger and suffering, and then learning how not to retaliate (even though we may have an initial knee-jerk tendency to do so). Recommended both as an introductory guide and a reference tool to refer back to over and over to enhance learning and practice of patience when encountering anger and suffering. All in all, a very good, practical toolkit for life experiences."
4,Ears are surprised,"A friend loaned me a music CD by this artist. I thought he lusted for her body. Maybe he does, and I don't blame him. But her voice, although not sophisticated, is simple, direct, and sexy. She can sing. The songs are not complicated, and the approach is not yet mature. Just play the music and turn off the analytical brain. There's something magical about a beautiful woman with a decent voice singing in the French language."
5,A smooth transaction,"The book came in time, the condition of the book was as stated on the website. All in all a smooth and timely transaction. Thanks !"
2,Weird noise reduction,"These are wonderful recordings. The noise reduction, though, sounds like the 1980s CEDAR system that has the effect of putting the sound through a flanger --- there is a shifting equalization contour that gets automatically set off by something in the recording. It is extremely unaesthetic tonally. No credit is given anywhere on the album of the restoration engineers or methods. I will see if I can find these recordings on Pearl or other reliable label."
4,Great Camera!,Well there is so much written about the 20D who could add to that? I will say that the battery life is truely amazing!The only real big drawback I have found to the camera is the Battery compartment door.... The catch is to flimsy for my taste. I somehow managed to break the tiny (and I mean tiny) catch on the compartment door. I still dont know how it broke since I have babied this thing since I bought it three months ago but alas it broke. Anyway Cannon would not replace the derned thing under warranty so there goes $15 for a new door with catch.Besides that this is a awesome camera.
5,"Solid Camera Build, Quality Images",Love everything about this camera. Have had it for a few years and its durability and reliability stands the test. Newer models such as the 40D feel great and have larger viewing screens. My next upgrade will be to a 5D.
4,wish i knew i needed,This is great. I was surprised no lens caps or that I needed software to download pics. This would have been more helpful.
5,The Best Digital Camera Yet!,"I received this for Christmas, 2005. It takes excellent pictures. It is pricey, but well worth it. I am very impressed, with the quality of the photos and the quality of the camera. You do not have to wait between pictures, it can take multiply picture at a time.I have several Sony digital cameras and 2 Minolta film cameras and this is the best of the lot."
1,No support for 64 bit,"I can't believe they still don't have support for 64 bit operational systems. I can't use my EOS20D with any of the newer computers that have Vista 64 or Windows 7, and it is been years since they came out. Terrrible support."
1,Terribly made and pictures are too soft,"I am very disappointed with the Canon 20D. My first disappointment is with the sharpness of the pictures. I've tried all kinds of combinations for the auto and manual functions, but most pictures came out soft around the edges of the subjects. The Nikon D70 takes much better and sharper pictures. I was actually willing to put up with the softness because of the fast sutter speed, but then came the second disappointment. It's actually a shock more than anything else -when I changed the camera lens for the first time, the lens release button fell out and wouldn't stay in place unless I tape it down. This should never happen on a $1,400 camera! What a mistake in buying the Canon 20D! I'm returning the camera for a refund."
4,Great SLR,"Basically the 2 biggest SLR manufacturers in this category are Nikon and Canon. While both are great cameras, I ultimately chose the Canon because of the a wider array of lenses. I found that reading camera reviews on Amazon were not as useful looking at sites that were dedicated to digital photography."
5,I love it!,"I could notice the better quality immediately when I started using it. It allows for much more creativity than my previous camera, a Nikon Coolpix 5000. It is relatively easy to use and still fully automatic for those times you need to snap a quick picture and don't want to worry about exposure and all that. I have a canon eos 35mm and I found the digital SLR to handle much the same. It is a tad heavy which makes it difficult to take night shots without a tripod, but I still think it was the best option for the money. I find it to be a great learning tool for experimenting with the more creative aspects of photography."
4,Long Listening Favourite,"If these are the cassettes that my friend gave me (and that wre ripped off by another) then you don't know what you are missing. Ir should be the original BBC radio broadcast and they are even more hilarious than reading the words yourself. Great for the car, cleaning the house or getting stuck in improbability drive!"
2,WHAT THE HELL?!?!,"first off, i want to say, i don't usually read sci-fi, i read fantasy, but i decided to read this as the movie is coming out and i like sci-fi movies. this book just made no sense!! it was totally out there. what was the point of it? sure, it was funny, but there was just no character building, no proper story line. but, hey, that is just my opinion :)"
3,Not Impressed,I saw the movie first so some the scenes where rememberable but like most books done by British author I do not get all the humor. I found this one harder to grasp at time then say a Terry Pratchett novel.The stuff I found funny was the stuff that I already knew the punchline like the meaning of life answer. When I think about this book now there really isn't much I like about it. The voices of the character in my head feel kinda of annoying.I guess I am just not a fan of British humor.
2,"Dissappointing, considering the hype","What a huge dissappointment! I found the book extremely boring. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent fantasy/sf I've been reading, but I found the plot very slow moving, and generally uninteresting and uninvolving. I also disliked the extreme amount of humor and satire in this book. I prefer my novels to be more realistic. I like adult situations (complex relationships, betrayal, violence, etc), and I couldn't find any here. It felt as if I was watching one LONG episode of Futurama.There were good things, however. The book was extremely short. I got through it in one sitting (about three hours), and I don't think I've ever done that before. Also, I found the book slightly humorous in parts, which served to barely keep my interest for that 3-hour reading stretch."
3,The hitchers guide to the Galaxy,"The book was like new, the service was fine .I just didn't like the story and finished reading it hoping it would get better , it didn't. It would not be on my must read list ."
3,You need to appreciate British humor to like this,"Earth is about to be blown up to make way for a new space highway. Arthur Dent, your average ignorant human being, is lucky enough to hitch a ride with his alien buddy on a passing spaceship just moments before Earth is destroyed. Now I like a good laugh, but some of the humor in this book is just stupid. When Arthur convinces the man who is trying to demolish his house to actually protect it while Arthur leaves, I knew early on what kind of nonsense I was getting into. Some people like that kind of humor, but I find tiresome. You really have to appreciate British humor to like a book like this. On the positive side, it's a quick read (I finished it in 2 days) and does present some interesting and funny ideas about the origins of Earth."
4,I have a question for anyone who might be able to help me...,"I recently purchased this book and read it.. I think it is a great book all around. It's funny, entertaining.. Also has a little bit of action. I was also assigned for school to write an explanation on how the conclusion of novel leads up to the last sentance. And also if the sentence is appropriate as ""the last sentence"" of your book? Why or why not? I am kinda having some difficulty on this one question and I need to get it done it is worth 20 points of my project and I would really appreciate it if someone is kind enough to help me out. Thank you"
2,The book made NO sense!!!,"It was confusing. The plotline kept switching and it was hard to follow, and it really didn't have a backgroud. I felt like a was just thrown into it. I gave it two stars, because it was funny. The characters are constantly making humerous remarks. I recommend this book for anyone who likes comedy and doesn't mind a weird, out-to-lunch plotline."
2,"In terms of food for thought, this is pure sugar; no meat","Lots of fun to read; takes an evolutionary point of view regarding the origin of humanity and the rest of the universe. You won't really find anything of real, lasting value here; but that's not why you picked it up, anyway. Perhaps the qualities of fun and exercise of imagination are enough to justify."
4,The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a great book!,"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a very interesting book about Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect. They hitch a ride on a spaceship before earth is destroyed. Rhern they learn many things that the people of earth never knew. They found out how earth wasn`t what they really thought it was .It was actually a super computer built by a foreign planet.They also meet some weird and new creatures on the way.Like zaphod Beeblebrox, a two-headed three-armed alien who is the president of the galaxy. this book was hard to put down because it was so interesting. It brought some far-out thoughts to my mind, and things I couldn`t even imagine. Like how big the galaxy is and how much there is in it.I recommend it to anyone interested in reading about very funny and different things. It has plenty of action that keeps you stuck in the book. You have to think imaginatively when you read it. It`s a great free time reading book."
5,YOU'LL LAUGH 'TILL IT HURTS!!!,"Quite possibly the funniest book ever. Adams' ability to go from mundane to absurd in a heartbeat is incredible. Just when you think poor Arthur Dent has done and seen it all, he falls into another disastor. This book is the sordid tale of a poor beguiled Englishman who just can't get out of his jammies in the morning."
4,I haven't read yet.,I heard this book on public radio a long time ago. And I saw the movie. I had to get the book to remember the things the movie left out--I am sure it will be a very good read.
5,Satisfied,"I always wanted to read this book. Now I can, and will. It was easy to find and purchase and the book arrived quickly."
1,Yuk!,"Didn't finish this book. I kept trying, but never got hookedCouldn't keep up with the characters. Names were too crazyNot my type of read"
3,I think I was too old when I read this...,"I think I would have found this wildly funny in college, but reading it at this stage in my life, I found it mostly pointless and silly, with moments of humor. I'm glad I read it, as its considered a sci fi classic (I guess), but can't say I'd recommend it."
2,"Good book, but no Text to Speech","I was to start by saying this: I have always enjoyed the Hitchhiker's series a great deal. If there's one set of comic-themed scifi books that you ever get a chance to read, it should be this series. The one and only reason why I have rated this Kindle edition of the book so poorly is because they have disabled Text to Speech.I can understand audiobook companies weariness of highly intelligent, well designed text to speech software, but it doesn't excuse their actions. By disabling this software, (audio)book companies are only hurting their fans."
4,The Monthy Python of Outer Space Adventures,"In this introduction to Douglas Adam's unique wit and satire, Arthur Dent, the protagonist, sets off on a rampaging Alice in Wonderland like journey through outer space. Through it all he encounters very strange and farcical creatures and events that reveal the jukebox of the universe, the ebb and flow satire that is life in all its monumental and diminutive creations. A great adventure to the nether regions of outer space."
5,My 17 year old son loved it,I bought it as a gift and my 17 year old son loved it and wanted to give it to his friends.
4,Great book if you like a bit of sci fi,"This book is humorous and a bit advanturous. I can't say anything in comparison to the movie as I never saw it, but the book is nice. If you look you'll see that this author wrote other books, this one is just the first one of many."
4,Reading with Tequila,"This book was a very easy, very fast read. Much more entertaining than the 2005 movie. It was very sci-fi and very different from anything I have ever read. Aliens aren't something I generally enjoy in my entertainment but I really enjoyed the humorous approach and casualness of the book. I was so blown away even though there were aliens and it mostly took place in outer space."
4,Brilliant. Highly Recommended.,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxyis an absolutely hilarious science fiction spoof in which the Earth is a giant computer built by sentient mice in order to figure out the meaning of the universe, only to be destroyed seconds before it fulfills it's purpose; Vogons epitomise the very essence of Public Service mentality; and intergalactic hitch-hikers travel the universe with the help of the best-selling 'Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. This book is easy to read, often odd and , above all, funny. I highly recommend this and I will be on the lookout for the rest of the books in the series."
5,A very funny book!,This is the best humor/sci-fi book I have ever read. Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect are the greatest duo there ever was and ever will be! You must read this book.
5,Wow,"I don't read a whole lot of books just for fun. College takes up most of my time, and I was worried that I would start this book and never finish it. Wrong. Not only did I finish it, but I finished it in no time flat. I couldn't put it down. Bottom line; IT ROCKED. Best part is, this isn't a book for Sci-Fi'ers or any other type. This is a book for one and all. This is an easy, fun read. BUY IT!"
5,Absolutely the funniest strangest book you'll ever read,"For those of you that are core sci-fi fans, you won't find what you want here. For those of you that enjoy sci-fi and enjoy humor, this is for you. With the brilliance of any man alive, Douglas Adams combines characters with words and creates the funiest sci-fi related series of books known this side of the galaxy. This, of course, is the grand-daddy of them all. It's easy to read, and will make you popular -- just like that froody Zaphod Beeblebox"
3,Humorous yet lacking something....,"Douglass Adams' ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" is one of the most amusing books I have ever read and if I were just to rate a book on soley humor, this would have probably gotten five stars. The plotline of space travel is unique and fascinating. Tis book also tries to answer life's big questions in a very humorous, light-hearted fashion. One big problem I had with the book was the very abrupt ending that not only caught me by surprise, but was very anti-climatic. Also, there were some fascinating characters that we were superically introduced to that I wish the author had explored a little more. Overall a very enjoyable read, yet had some key elements missing."
4,Don't Panic,"I only give it less than four stars because it's so short and a bit disjointed. A throughly funny read, however, and well worth picking up, it should be rated four and three quarters or so.I read it again so I could go see the movie with the novel freshly on my mind. The last time I read the story was many years ago, and I have heard it as a book on tape (which was really good too).The humor is definately more clear as an older adult, if you read this book back in the eighties, like I did, and haven't read it since, it's time to pick it up again. It's not long and can be read in a few hours, it's worth a few laughs and at the very least will prepare you to see the movie that just came out.Cheers, and thanks for all the fish."
4,And now for something completely different.......,"Interesting,enjoyable book. I found it to be quite funny most of the time. It was hard to put it down once I started reading it. I have always enjoyed the ""Man's sense of anomie, one person trying to fit into the culture of others"" kind of scenario whether it be in books or movies.Dent is clearly that kind of person in this book. I like Adam's unusual sense of humor and his characters. The pictures he paints are vivid. The stories are implausible yet enjoyable. The characters are realistic in an unrealistic sort of way.To sum up: The book holds your attention, it has interesting, funny characters that were not formulaic,the story was fresh,and the visuals that he painted were good. All in all a good experience"
4,improbably great,"By the strangest coincidence I left this classic at the office and was stuck at home reading Hemingway short stories. Hemingway writes about drink, and war, and illness. Adams, on the other hand, writes about drink, and war, and illness. One thing's for sure: Hitchhiker's Guide is not science fiction. It is also not science. Probably not fiction either. What it is is really weird, like the front page of the daily newspaper, only more enjoyable."
3,The Reader's Guide to Entertainment,"The Hitchhikers Guide was a novel unlike most i have read before. Along with intellectual inferences, came a light mood and un-used setting. How often do you read a comical story that deals with outer space, and the life that may exist out there? Douglas Adams knows his audience, and can appeal to everyone that is able to read. Being older, a reader may have more understanding of the scientific inferences, like the improbability drive for example. However, no matter how old the reader is, anyone can feel relieved when a missile is turned into a whale while in midair. This novel may have been humorous, but at the same time, a more educated reader can come away questioning all the universe really has to offer. Is there more out there? Adams writes this novel as a way to get across his ideas about the universe, and changes it from a science fiction, into a comical, yet throught-provoking literary work. I would reccomend it to anyone who needs a laugh."
1,Maybe it's just me ...,...but I thought this book was terrible. I've been more entertained reading the ads on a New York subway.
1,One word...OVERRATED!!,"This book is marginally funny, at best. At its worst, it's just plain boring. I bought this book because I heard it was on the same level as Monty Python, nothing could be further from the truth, Monty Python has jokes, funny ones, this book relies on lame puns. Most of the time the book is just plain weird, some of it doesn't make a lick of sense, a hippie with three arms is president, people can understand any language in the universe by holding a fish to their ear, the meaning of life is 42, what the hell is that all about? Is this supposed to be funny? Seems there are only two schools of thought on this book, people who think it should outsell the Bible and people who use it for kindling. I use my copy to help cure my insomnia."
1,wow just wow,"when i first heard about this book i thought ""another useless published piece of dirt with no humor but when i read it i was impressed cheers to who ever the author is bang."
1,More Rubbish for Fools,"The book begins with the hero sitting down in front of his house in order to stop it being demolished to make room for a highway. He's lucky he wasn't Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed by an Israeli driving a bulldozer. Her death didn't receive one per cent of the publicity accorded this book, which descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity. If you want a laugh that will make you wiser, read Mark Twain or Joseph Heller. If you want a good story, read Chehov or Tolstoy. They won't make a fool of you."
1,Utter nonsense,"First of all, let me say that much of the so-called ""story"" in this supposed ""book"" is nothing but lies and weirdness. Some of it even defies all belief! If you like books about crazy aliens who act like they are out of their gord, well maybe this book is up your alley. I'm worried that if you let your children read this, it will make them think the world really works like this, and that you can talk to mice like they are people (no kidding -- it says that). Good luck teaching kids right from wrong after they've had their brains scrambled by this rubbish. At times I could not tell if Mr. Adams was trying to be funny or if he really thinks this way. I suspect maybe he needs professional help or something. I shudder at the thought of encouraging people to publish this sort of insane rambling as if it were a travel guide to outer space. I certainly didn't get any good, practical travel advice from this book. Stick with Fodor's and save yourself the bother."
5,Don't panic! This one's 42 times the fun!,"Grab your towel, stick your Babel Fish in your ear, and set off with Arthur Dent on his tour of the galaxy. Still fun after all these years and the father of a million bad puns, this satirical sci-fi spoof is nothing but fun. A pity we've lost Douglas Adams, but his priceless sense of humor lives on. The man was as funny as his work - I had the privilege of meeting him at a convention where he was booed only once. He admitted to wearing a digital watch. Re-read this if you're a fan, and check it out if you haven't. Timeless classic."
4,The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,"How would you feel if your planet got blown up and you survived thanks to an alien friend and a towel? In the book The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Universe, Arthur Dent and an alien named Ford Prefect escape the destroyed planet earth and meet some crazy people like a paraniod robot, a guy who thinks that there's a planet ruled by every lost ballpoint pen, and even the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy named Zaphood. I reccomend this book to people who like funny books and if you want to know what happens in the end, read this hilarious book!"
4,Good and Funny,"I really enjoyed this book.The story is very funny, and all comes together in a very interesting way. The reason that I gave it four stars is because it gets confusing and hard to follow at some points. The story starts whan Aurthur Dent learns that his house is being torn down to make room for a new freeway. His buddy Ford prefect, who he thought was human, but turns out to be an alien wisks him off of the earth just in time for an even worse termination. The hystarical things that happen as the two friends journey through space are worth reading over and over again. if you like humor, but don't mind reading something twice for it to make sense, you'll probably like this book."
4,A fun read,"Stretches your imagination, but never loses its sense of humor. Fans of ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" will enjoy this book."
4,It's like Monty Python in space,"This book is brilliantly witty at every turn. You just never know what to expect next but you know it will be funny. Adams is a master of the dry sense of humor and communicates it in such a way that you can't help but laugh out loud. There is just enough plot and character development to keep things moving, but the real lure here is Adams' sheer gift for humor. I recommend this book highly to all who refuse to take life (or themselves) too seriously--you will be delighted as you laugh your way through this one."
4,"Funny book, way too short","Now I know that this book is supposed to be a ""trilogy in five books"" but I can't help but feel a little cheated by the way this one ends. There is little in the way of closure and all I got from the ending is speculation. This doesn't mean that I hated the book though. Far from it, I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Douglas Adams really has a knack for writing in a drool manner that I found to be very amusing. The humor is very good and, I suppose, very British. The story shouldn't be taken seriously, but I guess that's where appreciation ends and geekdom officially begins. All I'm saying though is that I didn't get everything I could possibly want in terms of story but that's okay. Because I can't wait to get my hands on the next couple of books."
2,"Tired, So Very Tired","No doubt that ""Hitchhiker's"" is perhaps the most popular science fiction book ever. The reason escapes me. Ripe with throwaway absurdism and weak irony, this book made me wince more often than it made me laugh. However, it did occasionally make me laugh, so I can't dismiss the book entirely. I became quite fond of Ford Prefect, but I think that Arthur Dent is among the more unremarkable protagonists that I've known."
2,uggh,"The book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a very good book. It describes many things in life. Some are adventure, and excitement. It describes four friends and how they survive in the galaxy.After Earth is destroyed to become an intergalactic highway, Arthur Dent, and Ford Prefect make their way into the galaxy. They meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford's childhood friend, and Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend. The four enter an abandoned planet. On the planet they encounter many hardships, and they must use all of their wits if they want to survive.i personally thought this book was retarded"
1,uninteresting stream-of-consciousness babble,"I'd give this a NEGATIVE 5 star rating if I could. I'll never understand why so many people love this book and series (including my own husband). I went to see the movie with him when it came out, and it's the only time I've actually FALLEN ASLEEP in a theater.Unfortunately, I actually bought the book. One of the very few I have not kept ... the only way I'll read it again is if I end up in hell."
3,Not as Good as I Hah Hoped,"This was an interesting book with some pretty good concepts. It was an easy, quick read and was a good way to pass some time at my boring job. However, this book also had a lot of shortcomings. For one thing, the concept of literally Hitchhiking across the galaxy is cheesy, especially when the hitchhiker just uses a device to latch onto a passing spaceship. Also, the dialogue was terrible. The humor was nothing but bad British wit which the flimsily constructed character's angrily spewes at one another. However, the book was fun to read, so I won't be too harsh. There was more good than bad. I don't plan on reading the rest of the series though."
4,A great trip into the galaxy...,"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy was a book I honestly never had thought about reading. I started reading it because of the movie coming out...which only when I was only five pages from the end did I realize wasn't even based on. BUT....I am glad I read this book...and although like someone else stated some of the parts I was like ""huh"" and other parts I was like why didn't they finish explaining. I enjoyed them. I laughed hard at the beginning and even though not the most exciting book I ever read there was a compassion factor that made me keep reading to find out what happened to Zaphod and Trillian and Ford and Arthur. I actually am starting to read the next book because I want to know what happens with the mice, with the number 42 and what happens to the main characters. It is a quick read I finished it within a week-with work and college and many other things going on. So it is great for that. I am not disappointed that I read it. I actually am glad."
5,What the photon is this book about?,"Arthur Dent, a thirty years old man you'll find easy to identify with, gets bugged this Thursday morning by the council's willing to knock his house down to build a bypass. This is how the book starts. When it is about to end a mere hundred pages later, you find yourself having hitchhiked all around the fancy places of the galaxy, and discovered at just about the other end of it that you don't in fact belong to the most intelligent species on earth but ranks only third and that earth itself isn't just this charming little blue planet it wants to appear to be. It'll take seven and a half million years, but yeah, you'll eventually learn the meaning of life too, though you won't like it. This, of course, doesn't account for all the fun of the travel, say, in the improbability drive or at the place where they make planets.A fantastic journey in humour and the unforeseen. Now a classic."
1,"Either you love it or hate it, I hated it!","Not the kind of book to read if you are into thoughtful S.F like Frank Herbert or Asimov. The only good thing I can say the author is totally original and there is now way someone can figure the story line (there isn't one), every page is a surprise."
1,Wtf,Maybe the movie ties it together better. Reading this book was a complete disappointment. I will not be reading anymore of this series.
3,Don't believe the hype,"It's not really my place to judge a classic that is older than I am, but I didn't find this all too exciting. The story itself was rather dry and predictable and so was the humor. If you like British humor, than this is definitely for you. I don't know, I guess I was expecting more realistic science fiction, in which case this book certainly doesn't deliver. In short, think Monty Python + Outer Space + A couple hits of Acid."
4,Good book,A lot of friends had already read this book and I hadn't so I decided to read it as a break between textbooks (I'm in grad school). It kept my interest and was very entertaining. The best part?... it wasn't a text book!!!
4,Classic Book,"The book is great, of course. This particular copy of HGTTG has 30% dedicated to an insiders guide to the making of the movie. I was reading on my kindle and it indicated I was at 70%, but then I realized the book was ending and the rest of the kindle book was a description of the process of making the movie. I wish I'd known so I could have downloaded another book before I got on my flight!"
5,Skip the movie--go straight for the book,"I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi, but this was a recommendation of a friend (plus I saw the movie). What a fantastic book! It's cleverly written with hysterical commentary on human (and alien) life. Many sci-fi books are written with technical jargon, using words only the most geeky of geeks could understand. Instead, this is written with an everyday tone so even the common man can stowaway for the adventure."
5,MasterPiece,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy is truly a masterpiece. It takes you on a journey with great characters like Ford Prefect, Marvin the Paranoid Android, and Zaphod Beeblebrox the President of the Galaxy. Come and learn the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."
4,a crazy ride,"Be warned, this is not serious science fiction. Not at all. With that said, it's one of my favorite books. It's silly, it's funny, and it's strangely enthralling. The plot is almost irrelevant to the charm of the book. The next two books are just as great, although the last two (""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish"" and ""Mostly Harmless"") are not as funny. My recommendation is to stop after ""Life, the Universe, and Everything."""
5,EXCELLENT,"I thought this book was awesome. It doesn't get any better. Even if your not a science fiction fan, you will love this book. If you don't crazy and need to be admitted to a mental hospital. BUY IT!"
5,Never Forget your towel!,"In my honest opinion, Douglas Adam's is the funniest man alive. He doesn't have to be vulgar to be humorous. Never before have I chuckled or laughed out loud so many times at a book. It teaches us not to take ourselves to seriously, and have a good laugh or two. He also teaches us some great quotes to use from time to time. My favorite being ""The secret of flying is to throw yourself at the ground and miss."". That gives an overall feeling of the book, fun, funny, and nice to have. A must buy!"
5,Top notch!,"Amazon needs a kindle cover with ""Don't Panic"" on it! I am a total fan. I saw the movie and now have read the book. While I felt the movie is close to the book. I love the humor in this book! Buy it you will not regret it!"
4,"Enjoyed, but a little different","Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is about the fastest book I've ever read. It's a really weird kind of book about two survivor's of Earth's destruction and the journey they face. The book is easy to read, but understanding it (or even putting into words your feelings about it) are much more difficult. It is a sci-fi, alien meets man, adventure story which you will enjoy (but you'll never know why)."
4,Stick out your thumb and hop aboard,"I am very late to the Hitchhiker series of books having just read this one a week or so ago. In fact, I saw the movie before reading this book. That being said, I can see what my friends have been recommending all these years. This is a very funny novel, very inventive and will stretch your imagination. One caveat would be if you know you don't like the British sense of humor, this book probably won't work for you.Though it made me laugh a lot and shake my head at its ingeniousness, it gets 4 stars because of some basic problems in that there is virtually no character development and the plot is razor thin. But it's a short book and easy to read and very funny."
3,This one really pains me.,"I had high hopes for this edition of HHGG, but I was really not impressed at all. There is a lot of interesting history and other behind the scenes type information about the book, but when it comes to the section with the book itself, they use huge borders around the text, leaving the readable area about the size of a trade paperback. That makes it very distracting and awkward to read. Also, I had somehow gotten the impression that all three books were included in this edition, much like the Ultimate HHGG. However, it is just HHGG and not the two sequels. I'm not factoring that into my review as I went back and read the description and didn't see anything mentioning it containing all three, but I wanted to point it out in case anyone else mistakenly had the same assumption I did. I'll probably keep this just for the extra information about the author and franchise, but I'm going to be purchasing a copy of the Ultimate HHGG as well."
3,Ok For Now,First off the story and Douglas Adams are among my favorite books/authors. I recommend the stories!but: there are a lot of typos in this Kindle version. Just in the first chapter! Words run together. Some times three words.also: I wish they would get the cover art figured out. When I buy a book I want the original cover and a photo of the Author if it is with the original book cover.Please offer: The whole Hitchhiker' Guide series as a package price.Please make available: Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency by D. Adams as a Kindle book.
3,Perhaps I just don't get it....,"My students have enjoyed this book so much, I figured I would too. I realize this is part of a series, however, I felt the book was missing something. Many things were introduced in the story, but never discussed in any detail. I felt that this installment of the series did not conclude. It was almost as if the author fell asleep at the end of writing, said ""Ok, I'm done"" and published it.The story has its moments of humor, to be sure. This, combined with a lot of dialogue, made this a fast read.But, I must be missing something, for I feel this book to only be fair, rather than the amazing piece of literature so many others feel it to be."
3,good book,"I watched the movie and then read the book. I was actually a little disappointed. Although enjoyed the book, I felt that the movie had more...well...plot. I plan on reading the rest of the series, so hopefully it will get more in depth."
5,The Best Book Ever Written!,"If you like reading, and have any sense of humor whatsoever, you will LOVE this book! The story line follows a mishappen Arthur Dent on his exploits across the Galaxy with his Beatlegeusian savior, Ford Prefect. The Earth has been destroyed, and all that remains of this great computer is Arthur and two words, ""Mostly Harmless"""
3,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, 25th Anniversary Edition","What was all the Hype with this book? Ok, it's pretty funny and has some moments, but at the end of the day it's nothing special. I know it is loved by a lot of SF and non SF reader a like and since it is a 25th Anniversary Edition there must be something to it, but for the life of me and can't see what it might be. I just finished the book and don't remember anything about it, like candy for the brain."
2,Random Acts Of Witty Repartee & Crazy Plotlines Don't=Good,"Books. All the cute nerdy boys I had crushes on in middle school carried this series around as though it were a bible. So, being an inquisitive young lass (and also trying to suck up to them) I forced myself to read the entire series too. Imagine my shock to discover they are just totally silly and pointless flights of fancy with little insight & all the dated humor of a bad Monty Python sketch. I personally blame this book for my switch to dating obnoxious metalhead morons in high school and my 13yr aversion to an otherwise fascinating genre, science fiction. Read ""Whipping Star"" by Frank Herbert instead, if you're looking for comedic and zany sci/fi that's not empty-headed."
3,Amazing book. Terrible version (Kindle).,"I don't need to tell you that this book is amazing so I will leave it at that (if you don't agree, you probably take life too seriously).What you need to know is that this version, for the Kindle, does not honor the content. It is truly ugly. There was no thought put into the cover design (the image that Amazon posts for it on the Amazon.com is NOT the same that is delivered inline with the text, only the cover art) and the table of contents is a travesty. A book would not be printed with such shortcomings, it should not be digitized as such either.These may seem like trivial complaints to some, but this book and it's author deserve better."
1,"Hint: ONLY READ THIS IF YOU CAN""T FALL ASLEEP EASILY","what the heck was this junk? how didit get published. I had to read it for school and the only time i read it was when i had to go to sleep because this book helped get me to sleep very easily. Easier than a sedative. DON""T READ THIS BOOK FROM MY PERSONAL AND UNFORTUNATE EXPERIENCE"
5,The Word of the Wise,"This book is not only a great interview with imaginitive views, but thoughts that really do explain our world. This book is tremendous and has a great view of a world we don't normally think about. Read it....read the whole series if you want to become more amazed with our world."
5,WOW!,"I first read this book in eighth grade for a book report. It took me about two hours. I could not put it down. It's so funny! I love Marvin. Warning- if you hate to laugh, this book is not for you."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a must read for anyone who enjoys science fiction combined with humor. It's filled with wild satire and sarcasm. The parallels between two completely different events in the book make it even more interesting. Just remember, Don't Panic :)"
2,The author had no point.,"I didn't enjoy the book a whole lot. I guess it was a guys book. It was a bunch of made up words and childish jokes. I didn't absolutley hate it, it was okay. But he made us humans have egos. With our digital watches and all."
1,Worst Book of 2012,"I will never get back the precious time I wasted reading this stupid book for my upcoming book club meeting.This was a ""best seller""? There are few books I don't enjoy at some level, but this is one of them."
3,a quick stop at uranus...,"interesteing read and concept though this novel has no real beginning, middle or end, a bit like outerspace. if your into over the top humor in sci fi form, pick it up and have fun."
3,I Don't Get It,"Sorry, but I don't get all the fuss. The book is episodic. The writing is sophomoric. And I get the impression that Adams was either one sick dude or doing heavy drugs. A summer read, only for the bored. Doesn't deserve the following it has. If you want comedic sci-fi, try Connie Willis."
2,Hitchhikers's Guide to the Galaxy,"While the book seems to be wildly popular, I did not like it.I loved the beginning (about chapter 1-3), which were funny and witty. Yet during the travels through space I didn't consider very funny. While there was somewhat of a plot it seemed to be mostly pointless. However, there was a great twist in chapter 28 (or was it 29?); the book has only 35 chapters.Overall: good beginning and good end, but a waste of my time in the middle."
1,nothing has changed-no extras,"This book, being the 25th anniversay edition, I expected to have some ""extras"" or a foreward, or afterword, or something, but it's the same thing as the paperback format that I already have...which is a HUGEEEE disappointment. The story itself is an A..but if don't get this if you already have it...nothing is special about it at all."
2,Not a great book,"Even though this book was very funny, there wasn't much point to it. The book moves very quickly and doesn't leave much room for character and plot development. There are four main characters and none of them have well-developed personalities. It ends abruptly, leaving the reader wondering ""what just happened?"". If you're going to read it, you would be better off going to the library and spending your money on something else."
1,This is one of the worst books I have ever read!,I have never read a book that is as young and jouvenile as this book is. I couldn't even finish reading it I was so disgusted.
5,The best book I ever read.,"Don't know, what write here. I read it and I think, that it is the best book I ever read. If you didn't read that book, so change it very fast. Well, nothing more to add.."
4,Mostly coherent incoherencies,"At any given point during reading, I've been either 1) wondering how the author would clear-up the complicated situation he had created in the preceding chapter, or 2) laughing out loud on some seemingly logical, mostly innocuous, but totally nonsense sentences. Dull moments were rare, and fickle as human brains are, even in those moments I found myself cooking up some nonsensical variation on Adams' play-of-words. My only regret is re. the depressed robot Marvin. Though it was initially delightful to imagine a sentient, melancholy machine, in my view Marvin's level of conversation never reached those of the other main characters (Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, Trillian). Marvin kept on wearing the same depressed mold over and over and remained annoying, whereas the other characters remained maddeningly annoying!"
4,Life? Don't talk to me...,"Reading this again brought back so many memories! Loved it the first time, and it never dates. Just one disapointment, it seemed to finish so abruptly, I had forgotton it was a trilogy."
4,great,no problems. Prompt service. As expected. recommend it. enjoyed it. only is the first of the books in the series. hard to differentiate from the whole package. pricy.
2,Kindle edition - poor conversion of a good book,"No need to review the text, there are over 600 reviews, and I think those can pretty much cover what needs to be said. Rather, this is a review of the Kindle edition.This is a poor conversion to the Kindle. There are a large number of typos. Text formatting is almost totally lost. Only chapter breaks are apparent. Section breaks which quote the encyclopedias are marked with italic text, but otherwise all the sections run into one another with no visual indication that a new section begins. From reading this, I'd guess that the publisher simply scanned the text and performed no copy-edit or proofreading."
4,You are about to read a cultural classic,"A galactic freeway is passing through and you guessed it Earth is in the path.How many times have you asked a simple question and go the answer as ""42."" Yep, you are a victim to this book. Many of the clichés and truisms that rival Shakespeare are creeping into our vocabulary. And attitudes - ""It has been on file.""If you are the one person that somehow got through life with out reading this series or at least seeing this on TV, then you are in for a treat. Somehow this story is earmarked as sci-fi and I guess it can be in a sense and it has all the elements necessary; it delivers a powerful message to the local Zoning Board.I will not go though the story, as that is why you are reading the book. You need to sit down for the next sentence.This book has changed my life."
1,This book SUCKED!,This book definetly made me snore. I spent about 5 minutes reading it and I knew it was going to be the worst (or one of the worst) books I have ever read. The galaxy part made absolutely no sense and the way the author had objects on earth be something REALLY important in other planets was just plain dumb. So in conclusion...this book sucked...don't buy it.
2,No fun at al,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, because all critics were very positive. However after watching it, I really didn't understand for whom this movie was made. Some Monthy Python elements were put in, but things simply never get funny.All aliens are boring, but funnier than the cast still...Sam Rockwell's supposed-to-be-funny-character is annoying even when it is unintended. For its originality I give this movie two stars, but it should have been one. This is like watching comediants with another sense of humor than your own. (SARR)"
5,YO YO YO THIS BOOK IS OFF THE CHIZZAIN,I LUV THIS BOOK 2 DA X-TREME! IT MAKES ME LAUGH AND IT IS GOOD AND FUN TO READ. YOU WILL LIKE IT!
5,"Oh, WOW!","Do you have questions? THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY will provide the answers, along with entertainment, humor, and a load of aliens. Where else can one find a depressed robot, ""bad"" poetry:P, planet creators, and tons of ""coincedences""?"
2,OVERALL THE BOOK WAS NOT THAT GOOD.,"I WAS EXPECTING THE BOOK TO BE MUCH FUNNIER. THE JOKES WERE VERY DULL AND ELEMENTRY. I THOUGHT TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOOK HE COULD OF EXPANDED HIS THOUGHTS BUT INSTEAD HE ENDED IT ABRUPTLY. OVERALL THE BOOK WAS NOT UP TO MY STANDARDS, AND I WOULD NOT CONSIDER READING IT AGAIN."
3,still like the movie,"it was more detailed then the recent movie, but i still like the movie more, but it tells of all the little stuff in between, so if you have enough time, then go for it."
2,Didn't keep me interested,"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams was one very strange book. If you're into science fiction humor than this is a good book for you. I will give the author credit for good characterization. He goes into good detail about the different appearances and traits of each of the characters which brings the book alive. Both the setting and the plot were a little confusing however. The setting was constantly changing and the topic of conversation quickly changed from one thing to the next in a random way. This made reading the book a little tedious and frustrating to follow. All in all, it was not worth the time for me to read and understand this book, because it didn't catch enough of my interest."
5,BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE IN LIFE!!,"First off, any stupid turlingdromes who think this book is just one whole joojooflop situation can go to Belgium!!! Second, buy this book!! Third, this is THE funniest series in all of creation(even if the numbering is questionable)!! Fourth, buy(or ""acquire"") this book!! Fifth, this book changed my life. It totally warped my already liberal view point(nb on this point, if you are hardline Christian there may be a couple of blasphemous scenes) in a good way!! Fifth, but this book, or preferably, buy the leatherbound gilded version of all 5 books plus a bonus story that explains/confuses a lot of things!! Sixth, also buy the Dirk Gently and Liff series, and the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card!! Seventh, buy this book!! Eighth, Douglas Adams passed away on May 11, 2001!! Ninth, Douglas Adams's initials are DNA!! Last, BUY THIS BOOK OR PAY THE PRICE!!"
5,42,"This was an exelent book!I liked Marvin the parinoid android.The omnipotent mice were cool, too.The book had meaning, too, I don't know what it was, but it had meaning.Just kidding.It had no meaning at all!That's why I liked it so much and that's why you should read it too."
5,10 stars,"... This is a wonderful book with lots of froodiness. Now listen. The characters are subtle, sardonic, helpless, clever, stupid by turns. The writing twists swiftly from crazy to normal tones. Okay, too many obscene quips, but this is hilarious, very nice. I like the radio series too. See, this is kind of like Daniel Pinkwater for grownups. Science fiction and comedy make a very, uh, smoooth blend, almost as enjoyable as a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster!"
5,GREAT!!!!,"the best si-fi comedey I've ever read and a great book in it's own right, be sure to catch the follow ups"
4,"Dry, absurd and grotesque; simply great!","If you took the dry humor of Joseph Heller and the unique science fiction of Kurt Vonnegut, you would be near an understanding of what this book is. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a bit of fresh air from most other Science Fiction. Everything from Existentialism to Asimov's Foundation series is hilariously scrutinized by the metaphysical universe that Adams used for the setting of this story. The humor of this book reminds me most of the story-lines on the Simpsons. The action of this book requires the reader to suspend his disbelief. This book is so grossly absurd that it almost seems to parallel some of the problems of modern life. In the end, this book shows that while most of these problems will never be overcome, there will always be fodder to poke humor at, and that's at least a start."
4,Great!Couldn't Stop Reading This Book!,"Intriguing! Well-developed characters, understandable plot, this book has it all! It's about hitchhikers traveling through the universe. There are billions of planets and one digital book explains all of them, plus everything else in the universe. The book starts with the Earth blowing up. There is someone named Ford from another planet who is on Earth and he grabs his friend and gets on one of the spaceships that is blowing the earth up. They are thrown into space but Ford's cousin, Zaphod picks them up with the spaceship he stole. Then they continue to travel the universe together with Trillion (an earth woman), Arthur, (Ford's friend) and Marvin, a robot. I loved Douglas Adams' writing style! The descriptions were a little weak, but it is fun to imagine what characters and objects look like. Whether you like science fiction or not I think you will like this book."
5,I've never laughed so much as when I read this book,"This is a great book. I never would have thought than anyone could blend science fiction and humor. Actually, this book is more of a humor book with science fiction thrown in.This book follows the travels of Arthur Dent, as the world gets destroyed, and he gets miraculously saved and whisked away into an outer space adventure.I really enjoy Douglas Adam's writing style. He never takes himself too seriously. This is much more a story about the journey than the destination.And, if you didn't know, this is British humor. If you're a fan of British humor, you'll love this."
5,OH THE SHEER IMPROBABILITY,"When I cracked this book I didn't know what to expect, then as I progressed I fell in love with the compleate imporobability of the whole adventure I found the book somewhat low in details but it made up for it in humor."
1,Maybe classic,"I am sure that when this book came out, it was probably mind blowing. I did find it entertaining, but not enough to recommend to others."
3,I'm on the fence....,"I really liked this story. It was laugh-out-loud funny in places. The writing...not so much. This book could benefit from a thorough editing. Even so, it's still worth a read. Once. If it'd been better edited, it'd be on my keeper shelf. But as is, sorry to say it's not."
3,"Cute and funny, but ended rather suddenly","This book is very smart and funny but it ends very abruptly, and it left me wanting more than I got."
5,simply incredable,most likely the best sci fi book i have ever read. extremely funny and adventureous.
5,The Hitchikers Guide to The Galaxy,This is one of my favorite books. This is my favorite science fiction book. It is very funny. Read it or die.
2,It's ok...very dated.,"Well just wrapped up this book...And unlike other reviewers, I promise I wont write a book report giving every thing away.Any hoots, this book did have some laugh out-loud moments. After the first few though you began to see the setup long before the punch. Some long roads were traveled to get to the 'funny' and at times were a little too predictable.This type of humor has been played out to death since the time of this books writing. So the wit-factor is just not there.At times I got the impression this book had no idea what it was doing or where it was going. Almost as if it was not really thought out and planned but more just banged out and made up as Adams went along.Well all the reviews loving this back can't be wrong either. I guess this book is really more not to my personal taste. Thats my review and I'm sticking to it!"
2,What is the deal with this?,"That book could be rewritten as a good 20-page short story. That would be room enough for all the witty comparisons and good ideas it has. Also, the true randomness of the writing would still be interesting as a novelty.As a full-length book, it is a disaster. There's no plot, no characters, the randomness doesn't make any sense. If you shuffle the chapters the book would probably be as readable as it is now. It reminds me of some writing I and my friends did when we were 11 years old, only duller.I don't understand the high praises it has.BTW, I like a lot ""nonsense"" humor from people like Monty Python. You might call it nonsense but what they do is precisely crafted."
2,Review of original paperback edition released in 1981.,"I saw the many reviews of this first volume in the then trilogy and decided to dig out my first edition and check the notes I had written at the time. As you can see by the score, I was not as entralled by this novel as the more recent readers seem to be. It seems to be so much hype for a novel that appeared in the just reinvigorated sci-fi world of the early 80s.It is okay reading for young adults, but not for the seasoned sci-fi reader."
4,funny and true,"I had to read this book for english at school and found it to be one of the most funniest books i've read. Our class discovered that not only was this a very funny sci-fi novel but, also a send-up of real life. Adams satirises many issues common in today's society thus the novel makes you laugh and learn at the same time. I recommend reading this novel as although I had no choice I chose to read it many times afterwards."
5,Brilliant and Hysterical!,"This book, as are all of the books in the Hitchhiker's series, is genuinely funny from beginning to end. Douglas Adams writes brilliant satire...goofy humor, more sophisticated humor...everything is there. I would suggest this to anybody who has a sense of humor. ""The ships hung in the sky much in the same way that bricks don't."" --Hitchhiker's Guide, pg. 33"
5,"I've just read ALL the reviews, and thought I'd add my own","I've just finished reading all 267 reviews that Amazon has right now on The Hitchhiker's Guide. The reviews simply split into two camps. The 'I didn't get it' camp was home to a small, and unfortunately quite vocal, minority who simply thought the plot was confusing or the author was 'dumb' or some such schtick. Not to berate these readers, some were genuinely confused, but the sole reason they didn't like it is that they didn't *get it*. The people who understood the context of the novel, grasped its underlying satirical genius, loved it. So much so that their 5-star ratings totally eliminate the negative effect of the few low ratings. Folks, if you like to laugh and you're more intelligent than a mattress, give it a read. It's short, and it's worth it."
2,Unbelievable and just unfair,"I cannot buy this actress as a cop, and the story is too farfetched to make much sense or keep you from rolling your eyes. She does one stupid thing after another, commits crimes, and............spoilers..........gets away with it. Just wrong."
5,Excellent film!,These are great stories! It includes the whole story including the continuing story! This is a must have for all girls! Excellent!
3,"Great content, poor quality","It has been said elsewhere here but is worth repeating. While this is a great DVD (apologies to fans of the books; I am merely rating this based on the quality of the story/production, not on its fidelity to the original), there are two major shortcomings: there are no subtitles (gotta wonder why? . . .), and the quality of the DVD itself (two sided, no label, started to misfunction on day two) does lead one to question why they didn't put a little more into the production. Maybe future versions will . . ."
1,Poor Qulaity,"I found this DVD to be of poor quality it was grainy quality. It was a good thing I kept my VHS copies. I don't recommend this product. It is a shame too, I love this series."
2,Not Closed Captioned,"I purchased this set as a gift for someone who is losing their hearing and needs to use the closed caption feature. Although the description and the packaging describe the DVDs as closed captioned, they are not. Very disappointing."
5,Anne of Green Gables,This is one of my all time favorites. When the VHS tape wore out I had to have it on DVD.
5,Truly A Family Classic,"I have been looking forward to this collection on DVD ever since I finished reading the book series. It did not disappoint. The characters of Anne and Gilbert were so engaging. The humor and fun spread throughout the stories helps the viewer get through the sad times like when Anne loses her beloved caregiver Matthew Cuthbert. As Anne grows up, goes away to school, finally admits her love for Gilbert and then has to endure his departure to war, she always has with her, the love of the Cuthberts and the strength it has given her to hold on and move forward in good times and in bad.Anne of Green Gables is full of good values, moral judgment and clean fun. It is truly a family classic."
5,Anne of green gables 1,Anne with an e. no one could have done a better job than Megan Follows. she is perfect for the part.
5,Another keeper,I loved all the DVD's but the last one I didn't enjoy and don't usually watch this part of the sequel. But overall it is a wonderful story.
5,Best Movie Trilogy EVER!!!!!!!!!!,I fell inlove with the Anne movies when I was a little girl and now I am 34. I never get tired of watching. Quality television for all ages! I would HIGHLY recommend!!!!
3,This DVD has no subtitles,"I enjoyed my purchased a lot, but I didn't know that there was no subtitles, what I think is very important for people of other languages than english, french and spanish."
5,TIMESLESS CLASSIC,"This is our second set of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. Our earlier set in VHS, actually wore out. We have shared these timeless treasures with our grandchildren over the years, and now find we still get so much out of them ourselves. What a refreshing change in comparison to today's entertainment. I plan to have an ANNE OF GREEN GABLES morning with some girls from church. We'll have tea, goodies and just get lost in the mood. Very relaxing and reminds us to slow down and enjoy God's beauty TODAY, NOT SOME DAY.Gary and Susan Krueger"
4,late but in a very good condition.,I just got it on Friday but in a very good condition. It takes a long time here but it is better late than never.
5,Heart Warming!!,This is a wonderful series for any family to add to their DVD collection. Enjoyable for all ages.
5,A Wonderful Tale of a Young Girl,"This is a story of a young ophan girl that is adopteed by two elderly people, this wonderful story is the first part of the series (Anne of Avonlea is #2) A truly great film, a heart warming tale for the whole family. I never get tired of it!!!!"
5,Anne is a well thought up charactor . 100%,This a exellent film . I would reccomend it to family's with children. Some parts are sad so young children should be ucompnied by a older child/adult on 1st viewing.I think Anne's charactor is very well thought up she gets 100%. Teenagers may think this is a romantic film in parts.Overall it gets 99.99%
5,Anne of Green Gables,DVD in great shape - enjoyable version of the Anne of Green Gables classic story.
5,"a must for every girl, young or old....","I'll tell ya, I don't think that there's a girl alive who can't find some way to relate to Anne Shirley. I recall watching this on WonderWorks as a little girl, and absolutely loved it (and the Anne of Avonlee episodes, which I don't yet own). At one point I had them all on VHS that we'd recorded, but I believe one of my sisters took them when they left home, and I only just got around to buying myself a copy on DVD. And I'm so glad I did, because now I'm sharing my love of this story with MY 9 year old daughter. How special it is to be able to share something one loved as a little girl, with a little girl of one's own, and each able to relate to the story."
5,O Canada,"Anne is feisty, smart, and full of spunk. She is taken in by a foster mom and dad, the Cuthberts, who wanted a boy to help on their farm. Anne gets to stay and makes friends with her kindred spirit, Diana Barry. She flirts and fights with Gilbert Blythe. And she gets into all kinds of trouble along the way. Don't let the fact that it's set in turn-of-the-century Canada stop you from watching this family friendly movie."
5,A Wonderful Movie,I first saw this movie when I was a child. I loved it then and I still love it now. It's a great story and a clean movie! Which seems to be harder to find in today's market.
5,excellent adaptation,The books are nutty but nice with the first one being the best. The Canadians did a terrific job adapting this book and I owe PBS some money for airing this repeatedly. The series is faithful to the books so there are awkward moments from the book in the series as well but Megan Followes valiantly breezes through all of that and makes Anne's nostril flaring earnestness ring true.
5,"Kevin Sullivan's Anne with an ""E""","Outstanding movie - DVD format allows for interesting features like director's comments, extra scenes, actor insights. Several hours of wholesome family entertainment - a very good buy! You can find it on Amazon atAnne of Green Gables."
5,Anne of Green Gables is Wonderful,We have loved these stories and are grateful to have the whole set in this classic edition. The packaging should protect the DVDs for lots of use.
5,Simply Adorable!!!,"Ohhhh... if only movies were made like this more often. It's everything a great movie should be! It has great characters, a great story, humour, heartbreak, and a great love story! (Though it is more developed in the sequel) I practically grew up watching this movie, and I have to say that I still love it! Ever few months I grab it and watch it,... and still feel the very emotions that I felt when I first watched it as a girl!! A very touching and moving movie.... but yet not totally unrealistic. If you want to watch a good, CLEAN movie then watch this one! You WON'T be disappointed I promise!!!!"
1,Poor Quality video,This video skipped the first time it was watched. It is being returned! (Looks like an illegal copy because there is no label on the DVD!!)
5,anne of green gables,"Given as a gift, she loves it. She had a 10 hour marathon watching the videos. Watch it straight through in 1 day."
2,"Great movie, DVD quality poor","I can't fault this movie (or its sequel), they are simply fabulous and I've never come across anyone who doesn't love it. However Im far from impressed with the DVDs. I actually thought my copy must have been a copy of an original (didn't purchase through amazon), but from another person's comments I gather that I do have the original. Sound quality is only 2.0, no chapter searches (never seen a DVD without this), and the picture quality is about the same as TV. The DVDs are expensive and Im severely disappointed in the producers for not giving us a decent DVD. Have they no respect for this classic film?"
3,Be Cautious of These Reviews!,"Amazon is doing itself a disservice by mixing up reviews of the 2008 (unrestored) version with this 2011 'Hi-Def' restoration effort.There are huge differences in video and audio and in some cases (such as in Anne Part 2) the movie was re-edited with completely different takes.Many reviews are critical of the video quality of the 2008 set, but this totally does not apply to the re-mastered 2011 set.I do not own this set as I am waiting for the impending Blu-ray release, but leafing through these reviews makes it obvious that many people are commenting on the wrong set.Check the date before you read the review. If it is dated before Nov 2011, it is not for this set!"
5,"When It All Gets to be Too Much, It's Time for Anne!","I was a child who devoured books and the family copies of Anne of Green Gables and its sequels were my all-time most favorite books to reread time and again. Never would I have believed that this beloved friend of mine could be brought to life so perfectly on the screen!Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea are the two most important video sets in our well-stocked video cabinet. We can never watch just one tape, but we have learned to ""pace"" ourselves and watch the four over a two night period. ANNE gets viewed twice a year without fail and inevitably also gets pulled out to lift our spirits whenever life begins to suggest to us that there are things more important than truth. When my husband and I need to step back and remember the truly important things about life and relationships, we curl up together for a satisfying visit with Anne of Green Gables."
3,"A little disappointed with DVD, not the story","I LOVE Anne of Green Gables. However, when I purchased the DVD I was expecting better picture quality. I already had the VHS version and I actually thought those were better. The extras were great on the DVD but the DVD has you turn it around to side B to finish the movie. I thought DVDs could hold the entire movie on one side but that's my only complaint."
5,Excellent Collection for Anne Fans!!,"If you are an Anne fan you NEED this collection and you'll LOVE this collection. Definitely worth the price. The packaging is beautiful as well. All 5 disks are great. I had never seen ""The Continuing Story"" and was not disappointed. Watching the additional 5th disk w/ info behind the movie and the original creation of Anne has added even more to the meaning to the whole story. Love it! Love it!"
1,Anne of Green Gables DVD,"A great story, but the CD came with no insert to explain anything about the DVD. Very disappointed that you pay [this much], and get such poor quality video. The story of course is great, but they blew it in digitally restoring this. Maybe like the other person said they had a problem, or all these DVD's are boot-legged. The video quality is not up to par with any other DVD we have."
5,I still dream of going to Green Gables,This movie will show you love and meaning as well as good laugh. Anne Shirley is WONDERFULLY played by Megan Follows and you will surely(no pun intended) fall in love with her!I watch this movie when i am at wits end with everyone around me and i can always count on a smile on my face in less than 5 minutes. Share this movie with anyone you love and adore...ps...i am planning on going to Prince Edward Island (where this movie was filmed) for my honeymoon! Thats how incredible it is!
2,DVD quality poor,"After reading about the poor DVD quality of this great movie, I'll stick to my VHS copy. Thanks for the information."
3,Bland and boring!,"Anne Of Green Gables isn't really a ""guy-movie,"" but I usually don't care about stereo-typed films. In this case, though, it's not really an ""anybody-movie."" I didn't really enjoy the story of a girl in Canada who moves in to Green Gables and just sort of goes through life.In this film, the acting is strong. The scenery is lush. The plot is relentless. Truly, it is! I mean it's not awful, but the girl just kind of experiences life. If they wanted to make a film like this, more interesting details should have been added to the plot; that, or they could have shortened it up a little.If you're into the books, or just this kind of movie, Anne Of Green Gables should be real treat. Otherwise, skip this one."
1,Big Deal (zzzzz),"I heard so many great things about this movie, I decided I would give it a chance. Wow, what a mistake. So dull it puts you to tears. Its like a 4 hour Little House on the Prairie epiode from you know where. Just plain old corny and dull."
5,The Book Comes to Life,"I seldom read a book, love it and then enjoy the movie. Anne of Green Gables is one of those rare treasues where the magic on screen lives up to the magic in the novel. Megan Follows is first rate at portraying lovable Anne Shirley, an orphan girl, who comes to the home of elderly Matthew & Marilla at Green Gables. The screen adaptation follows quite closely with the novel and brings the images and scenery that L.M. Montgomery wrote about alive. This is a great movie to watch as a family, or if you are a fan of the Anne of Green Gables series."
5,How could you not love it??,"After reading the books and seeing the movies years ago i decided to watch them again on a rainy day. I had forgotten how touching the story was. Megan Follow's portrayal of Anne Shirley is amazing, she is an actress of utmost talent. Anyone who has dreams or imagination will certainly find a kindrid spirit in the the carrot topped girl. Her budding relationship with Gilbert Blythe as found out in the sequal is certainly a fine story line. The way they have the secret feelings for eachother is a romantic quality that is not found very often in the world today. I watched both Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea numerous times and could not get enough of it. People of all ages will enjoy it guaranteed, no matter if you are 8 or 38."
5,love it,A very good program and safe for kids to watch. very uplifting and safe for kids to watch alone. Good series.
5,Everything came as described,"I loved this series as a child, and had to get it when I saw it. The price is reasonable. The quality of the DVD is fine, just the actual video hasn't been remastered. Obviously no one's fault for that. No problems with shipping time, would recomend this seller again."
5,heart wrenching,"This has got to be one of my favourite movies of all time. Even the mini-series, and the spin-off 'Road to Avonlea' are awesome. Anne is so melodramatic, and over zealous. I'm so glad that they're coming out with a sequel, I'll be the first in line. I can hardly wait! I feel for the orphan ""Ann with an 'e'"". The story is excellent, and Megan Follows is a brilliant actress. I'm so glad that she agreed to do the sequel. I hope that you're paying her what she's worth!!!."
5,Great Series!,"Bought this series as a birthday gift for my best friend as it was her favorite mini-series growing up. We watched it together (my first time) and it was so good! It's hard to find good, wholesome things to watch these days. This is one of them."
5,What a joyous reminder of the PBS television series,Purchased the set for my bilingual (Japanese-American) granddaughter who lives in Japan and has read a number of the books. Watched them before sending them to her and relived the joy we experience when we first saw them on PBS a number of years ago.
5,Very worth it,"This DVD is 2-sided -- that is, you watch Part 1 on the first side and Part 2 on the second side. So you have to be kind of careful with it so as not to scratch it, etc. The picture quality is superb, as is the story, acting, cinematography, etc. It's a must-have for for anyone looking for a wonderful family-friendly story that all ages (say 6 years and up) can enjoy."
4,A movie for all ages,"Anne spelled with an 'E' of Green Gables is a wonderful film. Megan Follows plays an extraordinary Anne, who is lovable, can be a pain and is tremendously funny. I rarely like movies as much as I like the books they are representing, this movie is an exception. I LOVE this movie. My daughters and I have watched this over and over and over. The movie is set in another place and era and often the morals and hardships they endured are overlooked in this day and age. I love Anne's relationship with her bossom buddy or to Anne her 'kindred spirit'- Diana. If you listen carefully you'll learn from Anne. She'll make you laugh and cry. I hope you enjoy it like we do."
5,Surprised by joy!,"SURPRISE! Elderly Marila and Matthew apply to adopt a boy to help them on their farm, never guessing they would instead be given a girl who completely changes their lives. Anne bursts into their hearts with her incredible imagination, warm smile, and love for life. On beautiful Prince Edward Island Anne forms fast friendships, gets into pickles by being stubborn and dramatic, softens Marila's hard shell, and gains the affections of young Gilbert Blythe. This wholesome movie will make you laugh, rest in beauty, perhaps shed a tear, and remember why life is worth living and loving. And guaranteed: you'll never forget Anne!"
5,one of the best children's literature pieces you can find!,"Most people have read this book when they were children, but I read it when I was already 17 years old. Still, it wasn't hard to get inspired by such a character-- I have never encountered one that was as real and as alive as Anne. You get transported to that wonderful world and in the romance of it all, you are given this renewal in your sense of childlike wonder and awe at little things. Anne and her world becomes real for you, and in the process, you are able to view your own reality with much more ""scope for the imagination"" and see it for the beauty and wonder that it holds. END"
5,Great gift for girls of any age!,"I initially added this series to my on demand queue but figured I'd get more use if I bought it. I'm so glad I did! Mom and I enjoyed the entire series together and even more so since she had never seen it. (Even though the third installment is way too far fetched.)I have since bought this as a gift for a 9-yr-old and she loved it! I think it will probably be an oft bought gift from ""auntie Maya."""
1,Anne of Green Gables DVD pack,I ordered this for my fifth graders. The cover said it was 195 minutes which should have been two discs. There only ONE disc in the box.Not happy!
4,"Outstanding advaptation of classic canadian novel, perfectly filmed and acted. Megan Follows life work. Best film of 1986!","Follows and Rich Farmsworth outshineeverybody else here. Orphan girl getssend to work with Farmsworth and familyat farm and experiences all sorts ofgrowing pains. Followed by two sequels(1988 & 2002 (!)) Second better thanthe third. Great on location shootingin Nova Scocia and Prince Edward Island,Canada. I've been to the house there &it brought back many memories of the film."
1,Poor Quality!,"I just received this DVD series in the mail and was clearly disappointed in this product.Once I opened it I couldn't believe how cheaply it was packaged. I didn't even bother watchingthem once it was determined one of the DVD's was all scratched up as it was NOT secure in the DVD case.You couldn't tell which side was what,there were no pics on DVD's just plain. Sadly I decidedto return the DVDs and look elsewhere. These DVD's were expensive & I waited a long time toown these for my grandchildren...Not happy!"
5,fun,This movie was alot of fun. I enjoyed her trying to commenidate with the ways of the people she was living with.
4,Anne of Green Gables,"I saw that Anne of Green Gables? I love that video alot?Marilla Cuthbert finds Anne in the Garden crying becuase, Rachel Lynde was saying mean things to hear when she visited Marilla's house and Rachel was Marillia's friend and Anne Shirley yells at Mrs. Lynde and she runs out thr door and Marilla tried to call her but it was too late to run out the door, so she was treated in such a fashion then Mrs. Lynde walks away from the house? Marilla found Anne in the garden on the bench crying.The next morning Anne says, ""Mrs. Lynde! I'm sorry I said those rude things to you and forgive me?"
5,My favorite movie!,"I have read all of the books by Lucy Maud Montgomery, and it was all because I watched this movie three years ago in class. This is a great movie for girls about 10-12. (I am 13). I you see the movie, make sure you also read the book. There is a new movie that just showed on PBS- good, but it didn't follow the books. Megan Follows is just how I would imagine Anne!"
4,Childhood revisited,The quality of the video was very clear. The sound quality was every good as well. I would recommend it.
5,Anne of Green Gables: Collector's Edition,"Item as described, brand new. This is a great classic movie, who likes old- timey movies. great movie all together."
3,Pretty good ideas.,"Some of these ideas are silly to me and not necessary to do. However, some of the ideas are really neat."
2,Should be 101 secrets everyone knows,Very little in here that we don't all know. The price is right but don't expect anything that will surprise you or the kids. I gave it two stars only because it wasn't very expensive.
2,Agree with the previous comment,"Totally loved it, the best light ever but has a major problem which is the wiring that goes to the bulbs, after some use -mine lasted only 4 months- it goes completely dead. Very dissapointing"
4,light-weight,"very useful and doesn't weigh alot, it is bright too. The wife enjoys reading at night and now does not wake me up."
1,First Day of Christmas Review,"For the First day of Christmas I'm going to review...Little Monsters.The Monster:Maurice is nothing then a Beetlejuice clone. The overall acting is cheesy & over-the-top. There's no moral or lesson. It's not that fun at all. The images are too scary for most kids and visualy unpleasing. The Monster World is not even that creative. It looks like the backstage of the set. There's a ton of unexplain story issuses like the parents getting a divorce. It's also very mean-spirited. The pranks,the father and monsters are all cruel. Not only that,the cruelty in this film amount to nothing. Overall, avoid this movie at all cost. I give this film a 1 out of 10."
2,WORTH THE WATCH ONLY FOR ITS STUPIDITY!,I love The Wonder Years - I truely do. I rented this movie because I insist on watching all the movies that Wonder Years stars are in. Here what I've got to say about it: It's the stupidist movie I've ever seen in my life. It's so stupid that it's funny that it's so stupid. UGH!! I give this movie two stars and only because I feel sorry for it.
5,Loved it as a kid...,I have been collecting movies that I loved as a kid. My Uncle sent me a copy of little monsters on VHS when I was about...12? I absolutely loved it and watched it so often the tape itself was starting to showing wear (plus I could do everyone's lines). Unfortuately someone permanently borrowed it (or maybe my parents trashed it) but in browsing Amazon I found it again so getting another copy to include in my collection. Am now 'patiently' waiting for my copy to arrive...
4,"""Great 80's Kid Fantasy!""","Fred Savage and Howie Mandel star in this 1989 fantasy.A boy befriends a monster from a magical world underhis bed. I've loved this since I was a kid and so gladto have it on dvd that has good picture and sound,but only the trailer. I recommend this great 80'skid fantasy."
4,Little monsters rocks!,I just love this movie soo much! I remember watching it when i was a kid and now that it's available on DVD i would recommend it to anyone!
5,Great,"Was looking for this movie for some time and finally found it! Great price, and didnt have to wait long at all!"
5,Great Movie,"I really enjoy this movie, it is a classic! You can watch it over and over again, and never ever get bored with it! I reccommend this movie to all."
5,AMAZING AS IT GETS!!!,i love this movie i am spechless to say how good it is you should definently get it it is an adventure!
5,OMG!,I use to love this movie. And like the other guy i went to suncoast and they didnt have it! I got so mad and i though i would never find it again. well luckly this site exsist! This is a great movie and one of my favorites even though i am 15! It has alot of imagination in it and like the other guy to it sometimes feels your in it!
4,It's Zamfir!,What can I say? It's Zamfir. Either you like it or hate it.I'm disappointed at the selection of songs included in this particular CD.I can't believe these are his greatest hits. Some obscure songs.
2,Unimportant,It was a joke for a friends birthday. I would no more listen to this than I would to a whole ablum of saw playing.
5,A first-person account of living with Alzheimers,"Ellen's second husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's after a nine-year marriage. Shattered Lives provides her first-person account of living with Alzheimers, including many tips on how to find solutions. Mostly, Shattered Lives is a documentation of the emotions and challenges which come from living with Alzheimers, and the relationship between two very special people."
1,This not the Adrian Belew band,"This band should not be confused with the band ""The Bears"" which features Adrian Belew of King Crimson fame. It is another band of the same name."
4,Excellent taste,"There's so many of these products around now, it took a while to find one that genuinely mixes well with water and still tastes creamy and delcious, while giving you the daily dose of protein. A+"
2,"Contains artificial sweetener Acesulfame aka ""Sweet One""","Don't think that the sweet flavor in 1 serving comes from the 2 grams of sugar. They are dumping massive amounts of the artificial sweetener Acesulfame, also known as ""Sweet One"", into this protein shake. Amazon should be more forthright in advertising this product."
4,The Whey to Go,"When I first read the instructions, I read something about a scoop. I had no clue as to what the gram size was in a scoop so I hoped for the best when I opened it, hoping for a scoop. I opened it. There was no scoop. But then my brain started to churn and I figured that the scoop was in the center of the jar. Damn. I washed my arm like a doctor does and dried it. Then I shoved my hand down in that jar like an artificial cow inseminator. Lo and Behold, after some wriggling, I was triumphant with my scoop! Now I scoop that in my water, milk, or smoothie everyday and I see some good results! The taste, ah, well, do you really ever think vanilla protein will taste good?"
2,Definitely NOT the best tasting protein powder...,"Blech!! I have to plug my nose to get this stuff down in the morning. I've been using American Sports Nutrition, American Whey in Chocolate... religiously, but when my local dealer was out of it one day, she talked me into switching to this...telling me that it tasted great. AWFUL, absolutely awful in comparison to American Whey. I can't wait until she gets it back in stock, so I can ditch this stuff. What a waste of money!!"
1,Yuk! Too sweet!,"Having tried other Whey products, I was really disappointed with this one. Way too sweet. If you need something to discourage your use of protein powder, this it it!"
1,does not work with d300 and a md 10 battery pack,i bought this battery to use on my d300 with a battery pack it does not work. you need original nikon ne el4 battery to be able to use the d300 at 8fps
4,Works OK,"Bought this as an extra battery for a used D2h. I've been happy with Lenmar batteries for my Olympus cameras before, so I went with them here. The battery lasts quite a while, as could be expected for a pro camera. However, the last 40% of it drained surprisingly quickly. Perhaps it needs calibration, but the camera's battery meter went from two out of five segments to zero in a flash. Not the type of performance curve one would expect."
5,WAREHOUSE 12 SEASON 2,GLAD TO ADD THIS SEASON TO MY COLLECTION. I'M A BIG FAN OF THIS SCI-FI SHOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT SEASONS AS LONG AS IT'S ON.
5,Very good Season,This disc set is very good. As good if not better than season 1. Can't wait for the next one.
3,Warehouse 13,"I'm losing my interest. Its nice to get it online, instead of getting physical DVDs in the mail. That way, I can watch what I want, when I want to."
5,Warehouse 13: season 2,"I really like this series, the second season made me want the third. HG Well's who would have thought? It really takes off where the first season left off. I can't wait to see the newest season. Highly Recommend, the banter between Claudia and Artie is worth the look too!"
5,Still entertained,"Just as entertaining as the first season, can't wait to watch the third. The characters are still going strong and the new ones added in this season are just as good."
4,Warehouse 13 Season 2,I love the show and couldn't wait to get it on DVD. But I think it sucks that the Christmas episode Secret Santa wasn't in the release. It did include the Eureka crossover episode. But why couldn't Universal Home Video also include Secret Santa; especially since secret Santa is listed as a season 2 episode.
3,"decent entertainment, season climax was a let down","50% spoiler alert, this review contains a moderate spoiler.i enjoyed season 1, and was willing to forgive it for some of the rough edges.i probably would have forgiven season 2 for the goofy new slick editing andgoofy comedy lines, but the Season climax was unforgivable.after i started to connect with most of the characters, i was stunnedat how stupid the season climax was. i even liked the way severalcharacters had ""greyness"" to their characters which left yougiddily suspicious of everybody, but the final season climax was justtoo unbelievable. the villain did all thatjust to destroy everything. i think a more sinister plot wouldhave been more interesting. for example she could have been under the control ofan artifact that had some bizarre ulterior motive. but come on.the villain's final goal was just lame."
4,Cheaper in Amazon in Canada!,"Like others question price for this issue. Just bought it from Amazon.ca for 39.99 and since our prices for the identical item are usually about 25% higher suspect someone in Amazon.com has made a math error or whatever. But giving 4 stars for the progamme - light, easy but interesting material with very good casting."
2,Not missing much,"The first season of Warehouse 13 caught my attention. It wasn't bad - but not exactly a must-watch for me. Still, I decided to check out the second season, just to see if the show progressed.It didn't. It was lackluster - boring at times and so uninteresting that I didn't bother to finish the season.What a disappointment! As a fan of Friday the 13th the TV series, I had high hopes for this newly-charged revamp of the cursed objects idea. Instead, I find myself wandering back to my old FAV, Friday the 13th. (Mainly the first season, which is the best of the three.) I really liked the characters in that show, but with Warehouse 13, I sometimes struggle to really care about the agents and their coworkers.Warehouse 13 is simply too slow and unimaginative for me. While there are a few odd episodes that are decent, the series as a whole isn't worth the watch."
2,Secret Santa,"I love this show.. However, the DVD set for Season 2 is missing episode 13 - Secret Santa.The End."
1,Warehouse 13 has jumped the shark,"The first season of Warehouse 13 showed promise as a sort of Indiana Jones type serial adventure. The second season degenerated into sophomoric, comic book writing. It's a waste of time and money."
1,Can't recommend it.,"This series is one of the few I own that won't get watched again. I like Sci-Fi, but this one is pretty bad. Short and sweet it's just a case of bad acting/directing. The dude is just too dim to hold a job like that, and the chic just can't act. She's terrible (at least in this series). Warehouse 13 is destined for File 13 (the trash can)."
1,Cheaper to download?,The amazon download service has this at 1.99 per episode. At 13 episodes that's about 25 bucks for the season. The DVD is $40 for some reason. Is this a mistake?
2,wow,ive been watching the second season on tv and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is such a cool show. it keeps you interested in watching each week to find out what is going to happen next with myka and pete.
2,Fast & Furious Summary of the Vietnam War,"The images in this video are very good, but the narrator speaks so rapidly that only the most educated & familiar (with the war) can attempt to keep up. All the major events in Vietnam & at home are reviewed... but so rapidly it does not serve as an adequate review. The narrator, additionally, is overpowered by the loud background music. Few will find this video intellectually stimulating, entertaining, or useful."
5,Awesome Book!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the best children's book I have ever read. I thought Danielle's situation was shown in a very realistic way. This story also showed how well liked the main character was, wven though she was not considered ""popular!"" I loved this book and I recommend that everyone should read it, children and adults!!!!"
3,"decent content, crappy cinematography","Relatively interesting insight into the lives of 3 up-and-coming designers; the content is decent, albeit nothing memorable or noteworthy. I mostly felt compelled to write a review because of the poor filming--it was like someone removed autofocus on a point-and-shoot camera and gave it to a 3-year-old to wander around with.I understand some out-of-focus lens blur and camera shake is purely artistic, but--given the fact that it was headache-inducing--it was evidently unintentional. e.g. when people are talking, everyone and everything is out of focus (gets pretty frustrating after a while). That, and the camera frequently zooms in (with a shaky hand) and wanders on peoples noses or mouths. Oh, and lots of visible boom mikes and cameramen.The unfocused, wandering lens gave me a headache so I had to stop watching; I'm never nitpicky about cinematography in documentaries, but if I can't even finish the film it should be commented on."
3,PREDICTABLE,"Easy to tell from the get-go who the real contenders are, and the winner(s) is/are as one would presume, unfortunately. No ""grit"" here, nothing amazing, but amusing. The odd thing is that after the winner is announced, it almost seems such a terrific let down and disappointment. The production is less about the clothing, than lighting, effect, and music. I love that, but it would have been nice to have seen the CLOTHES in true color and not through lenses smeared with mayonnaise and surreal lighting. A personal prejudice; the industry has to get beyond this infatuation with fur. Though not featured, it is mentioned as an advancement in one of the contender's future collections. Just ridiculous and out-of-touch, thanks largely to Ms. Wintour's obstinate stance on this issue. Worth a look, but don't get too excited."
3,A disappointment,"While I understand that the real fashion world is not as ""kooky"" as what we see on the wonderful ""Project Runway"" -- OK, it's ""kooky"" in a different way -- I was expecting to see a little more about the artistic, rather than the business, aspect of the fashion industry. While I did find it very interesting to learn more about what is involved in bringing fashion to market, I would have like to see more about the designers' creative process. More of that and less ""drama"" about their personal loves would have made for a much more engaging and satisfying documentary."
1,"""Crystal""? Really?",This is a bunch of plastic beads stuck to a metal bracelet. You can find much nicer stuff at a craft fair. :-P
4,Beautiful!,Very happy with this beautiful bracelet- exactly as described! The colors are beautiful! The gift box was a nice touch.
3,received wrong item: books instead of bracelet,"I ordered this bracelet, but instead of bracelet received bunch of paper cover books!I got the return label by e-mail, and returned next day. Still did not get a refund. Same with earrings. I only received the necklace"
5,Great Bracelet!,"I bought these without expecting much from the quality. However, I was very impressed of how beautiful the piece is and my mother-in-law was very happy to receive it as a gift for her birthday."
1,A Total Disappointment,"When I read the cover of this DVD, I said WOW : ""Hysterically funny from start to finish"". So, I got the popcorn, dimmed the lights, started the movie... Finished the movie.. Not a single smile or hint of enjoyment.I totally advise against buying or even renting this movie.. The statement printed on the cover is truly false.I gave it one star because I thought the filming style was new, although I've seen it in some music videos, but it was new."
2,"Lock, Stock, and Twenty Smoking Foul Mouths","Like many people, I can hear the occasional swear word in a movie which heightens the dramatic or comedic effect. Yet, when it seems that every other sentence includes swear words, the dramatic or comedic effect wears off and these just become an endless string of offensive words. When you combine foul language with a heavy dose of gratuitous violence, you have a fairly good idea of the content of this movie. Are there some comical scenes? Yes, but not ha, ha, ha comical. My British friends tell me that it is easier for those who grew up in England to appreciate this flick, as they can understand the inside humor. For example, one of the stars, reportedly, is a famous English football star. Unfortunately, for some of us, who do not have the background, we just hear the swear words, see violence and remain unamused."
3,"Lock, Stock, and a bunch of smokin' babes","Pros: Good cast,although the actors seem a little wet behind the ears for this milieu (I can't believe I actually used that word! I hate that word!) If Quentin Tarantino and Groucho Marks had a kid, this is what it might look like. Very entertaining-- especially with the captions on. Pre-Madonna Ritchie, before he stopped thinking for himself. It looks cool, like a black leather jacket that makes you feel like a badass!Cons: Seems as though the makers of this movie only cared about the way it looked as opposed to character development and a tight and comprehensive plot. Still worth a look, just rent it before you make the decision to purchase. The soundtrack is good too."
3,Screwed twice by this film,I love this film. I got it on DVD and was disappointed in the way it looked. Then I got it on Blu-Ray and it looks bad too. I compared the two on my Blu-Ray player and the Blu-Ray is only incrementally better. People have got to stop giving this good reviews or they'll never remaster this thing properly for home release.
5,Bloody hilarious and clever,"Definitely one of the best movies ever seen. Gave Vinnie Jones credibility as an actor and in my opinion, made some people notice Jason Statham. Never short of action and typical Brit humour. One of the defining movies of British cinema"
5,Madman with an Afro.,"By far one of the best movies ever. 2nd to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Although, at moments, I had no clue what the people were saying, it was fine otherwise, becuase this is a brilliant movie. After while, you get so used to the usual sterotypical plots of Hollywood, right? Wrong. The premises in this movie and the ending will leave you both stunned and laughing. I highly recommend it to anybody who likes to laugh."
4,Fastest Shippment Ever Received!!,"This is a movie that my Hubby has been asking for FOREVER now, so I finally just ordered it online. Well, I must have forgot about it because I had a knock on the door Christmas Eve Morning (when I had only played on Amazon the night before) and there it was. Delivered already!Thank you so muck for being so prompt!"
3,Enjoyable--,"--and funny just to imagine the plot, but on the whole it was rather confusing. I don't think the lighting worked very well for most of the film, and the dialogue was hard to understand for me, even though I skimmed the translator extra.I like movies of this brit pulp genre, like Snatch, because usually they're so stylized and witty. This one seemed to only fill half the glass in that genre."
5,Best thing to come out of england since America!,"This movie was incredible, it was great in every way: good acting, good writing, great directing. One of the years best!"
5,Let's Not Get Carried Away,"heh heh, it ain't better than Pulp Fiction...but it's definitely a great black comedy. LS&2SB was very well written, perfectly cast, with some great acting thrown in. And he's right, if you liked Pulp Fiction (and can understand some thick English accents) you'll love this movie."
1,"Movie rocks, DVD sucks!!","This movie is absolutely fabulous. Unfortunately, the DVD version is VERY bad. The sound is totally out of sync with the characters mouth. VERY annoying...Hopefully they will fix this awful release next time... too bad there's no try before you buy."
5,The best movie I've ever seen!,"This movie, although at times violent, was one of the best I've ever seen and undoubtedly my personal favorite. It was incredibly well-written, well thought out, and the constant twists turns, and the incredible coincedences make this movie a must see."
5,Guy Richie is a genius,"I absolutely adored this movie (as well as ""Snatch""); the dialogue was snappy, the cinematography is AMAZING, the characters are well-rounded and it is nice and violent :-) I don't care if he married Madonna, this man is a genius and I'll be a fan of his work always!"
5,Awesome,"Great movie! Not quite as good as Snatch, but a close second. Think of it as a prequel if you want."
2,Great movie - DREADFUL DVD transfer,"Love the movie -- one of my favorites. But this DVD transfer is absolutely DREADFUL. Watching on a professionally calibrated Samsung 6167 w/a Denon 1920 DVD player over HDMI, the film looks like a 3rd generation VHS copy. The images are fuzzy, the color washed out -- all the hallmarks of overcompression. Very disappointing."
3,Good movie.,"This movie is funny - but be careful kiddies of the violent bits in the film! Anyway Eddie (Nick Moran) thinks he and his mates are the smartest, coolest guys in town. But when Eddie loses $1.5m in a card game they must cook up a plan or be cooked themselves! A funny, violent, weird and wacky movie to keep you on the edge of your seat! Look out for Dexter Flecther!"
4,A Classic,"I forgot how much I enjoyed this movie. Good characters, good story line and a good mix of humor and drama. If you haven't seen it - see it now."
4,Pulp Britain,"This film doesn't use the same plot device as Pulp Fiction, but it definitely has the same spirit and director Guy ""I married Madonna"" Richie was no doubt influenced by Quentin Tarantino. That being said, I find more humor in Lock, Stock than I did in Pulp Fiction. Lock, Stock is a caper flick at it's heart, and an entertaining one at that. Not too many extras to shout about on the DVD, but it does have a handy dandy Cockney slang dictionary which is useful for insulting people without them knowing it. ;)"
5,"Lock, stock, and great","""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a British crime-fiction film and is a breakout offering by Director Guy Ritchie.The narrative is cleverly constructed and whilst groups of protagonists at first appear to standalone their interaction creates a fantastic series of events.The film contains a terrific cast and many of whom have become very well known since this work such as: Jason Flemyng (as Tom), Dexter Fletcher (plays Soap), Nick Moran (is Eddy), and Jason Statham (plays Bacon).It is quite a treat for viewers as the diversity of the story with its many turns and twists is absorbing entertainment.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
5,one of the best action films I have seen,"I got this as a gift for someone and they enjoyed it. Came new in plastic & works perfect. As for the movie itself -Great action, plot and humor. If you like Guy Ritchie films and you haven't seen this you're missing out."
2,convoluted,"Watched this the other night with high hopes, but they were unfulfilled. It's confusing and slow in the begining, and the end while not totally predictable, was not too much of a surprise. If you liked snatch by Guy Ritchie you will probably like this as they are very close cousins (Snatch is more American as this movie was English)."
3,Guy Ritchie is a great promising director,"This movie is good but the direction is great. Guy Ritchie took a decent plot and enhanced it into a cinematic romp.This is a hip movie. The soundtrack is cool, the actors are fresh and different and the camera styles are unique.While there were some flaws in the movie (Some of the twists are too coincidental) there is no argument that Ritchie is a promising filmmaker in the same vein as Q. Torrentino"
1,Hated It,Cannot agree with the other reviews. Got caught up with the marketing of this film. Not quite the worst film I own but a close second. Found the story drawn out and a bit slow. The story as it leads into the action scenes is much too long. I found the sub-plots a waste of time. Anyone want to buy my copy.
1,Bloody Awful,"This movie wants so much to be another ""Trainspotting"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it fails miserably. The characters are bland and interchangeable, the plot totally contrived to be as ironic as possible. Nothing is more uncool than trying too hard to be cool, which this movie is guilty of to the third degree."
3,Good flick,"Even tough this movie continues the trend to somehow depict a group of criminals as 'good guys' it is still a very entertaining show. Each time I began to feel symapathetic to our 'heroes' I had to remeber that they were cop-beating criminals and as such belong in jail. Still the show is entertaining and worth a rental. Not worth a purchase, though."
1,Two words: Inspector Gadget,"For all you ""England has to prove itself to the world"" folks...you'll think this movie is ""the most amazing cinematic experience ever"". Well, I've got some news for you...this ""experience"" as you may call it is nothing more than a glorified attempt to bring Oasis to the big screen. I've seen four movies in the past week: (1) Clueless (2)Inspector Gadget (3) Water World and (4) Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking B's. Hear me now and listen to me later, I'd take Inspector Gadget over all of them. But, that's beside the point. The Sex Pistols really weren't that good...and neither is this movie."
2,Boring British Quentin Tarantino Knock-Off,"Basically just a pretentious knock-off of Quentin Tarantino's style. Pulp Fiction was ten times better, and obviously an original. This is just a british version with less interest, less character development, and less panache."
2,Not half as clever as it thinks it is.,"I cannot believe some of the reviews here. There are no great plot twists that you do not see coming from a zillion miles away. The joke caling the thin guy fat is not funny the first time and definitely not funny the fifth time you hear it. This seems to me to be one of those movies where we get to hear a lot of cockney swearing and not much else. Like the truly excreable ""Nil By Mouth"", one of the worst pieces of dreck masquerading as a movie that was not directed by Peter Greenaway. Also this movie (LS2SM) is supposed to make Vinnie Jones a ""star"". Give me a break. The only reason I give this two stars is because I lived in Liverpool and the attitude of the bungling Scouse burglars to the London gangsters is pretty funny ( and accurate )."
5,Quite simply - you should buy it!,"Some films are must-buys. This is one. Why? Multi-layered plot, quirky, modern, original, good acting, real villains playing the villains, and yet it harks back to the ol' British gangster flicks (the more things change etc...). Also look out for four NEW Lock Stock films co-produced and co-written by Guy Ritchie which are currently coming out on VHS in Britain (not yet in US), and which use the same ""success model"": Lock, Stock &...... Four Stolen Hooves/200 Smoking Kalashnikovs/Spaghetti Sauce/One Big Bullock. So run down your apple and pears, ignore the trouble and strife and buy these before everything goes pear-shaped!"
5,LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS,"You will want to watch this DVD time and time again, one of the best films out of britain, yeah, not all of us speak like the American Films make out ey....!"
2,"Nothing ""Special"" about this Edition.","If you own the previous edition of Lock, Stock you might really want think about if it is worth double-dipping. The transfer for this one is as good if not slightly worse than the previous 2003 release. There are only two (slight) new extras on this edition. ""One Smoking Camera"" features the film's cinematographer talking about how he shot the film. He takes us through a few key sequences and shows how they were shot or edited.Finally, there is ""Lock, Stock and Two F**king Barrels,"" a montage of colourful insults and curse words used throughout the film by various cast members.Why the extras on the superior Region 2 release weren't ported over is a mystery and as a result this edition is really not worth your time."
4,"""Barrels"" blasts with Rapid Fire Intensity and Wits","When my friend bought this DVD from Amazon, I privately laughed that she probably had too much spare cash, but when I saw it on a rainy night with nowhere to go out of boredom, I was genuinely surprised by what I saw. Guy Ritchie shot this film with so much passion and ingenuity, I was willing to overlook the rather insignificant acting, but focus on the interesting camera works, great editing and Ritchie's deft direction as well as his surprising script. A must-see and having seen it first in English subtitles help eliminate down time figuring out the cockney accented English, watching it second and third time without subtitles was the true fun of it all."
5,Better than Snatch,"If you like Pulp Fiction and Snatch you will love this movie. It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Try it, you will not regret."
5,Classic caper,"big fan of modern caper films, this is a must see as the predecessor to great movies such as snatch and the new oceans."
4,"Hillarious film, great soundtrack and colorful caracters","This is a film that you must not miss! Yes, it's violent. But it is all made with a sense of humor. I especially like Vinnie Jones interpretation. (Vinnie is a former soccer-player who once got a red card and had to leave the field after tree seconds!) Rock-singer Sting has a role as a pub-ownwer and father to man that is suckered in the rigged card-game. He is about to lose his pub and is, of course, not too pleased. The soundtrack is fantastic and includes James Brown, Robbie Williams etc...."
2,Rory's death?,"In the Director's cut there is no shoot out in which Rory dies. After the shout out in Eddy's flat Rory and the main drug dealer are alive. We see the drug dealer leave the flat and when Eddy and his friends come back to the flat, we see Rory, who was just alive, dead on the couch."
3,I expected more,"Sometimes in movie history there is a succesful formula that they overdone it.This is what we got here.Think what you have seen in pulp fiction,or city of god.You know all these stories that are put together piece by piece.However that is not done here with much success.Just a movie with has its moments time to time but not something memorable."
4,"A Fun, Dark, and Exceptionally Witty Movie","This movie has it all and it doesn't have any really big names starring in it. This proves the fact that bigger doesn't necessarily make it better. Guy Ritchie gives us an elaborate story about a group of guys wanting the extra buck. They invest 100,000 bucks into a card game and the person playing with their money loses. This makes them turn to crime to cover their debt. It's a fun movie with dry british humor that should not be overlooked by anyone looking for a fun movie to watch. The accents of the actors takes a few minutes to get used to but it actually adds to the realness of the film. I, myself, especially enjoyed seeing the famed soccer star Vinnie Jones give a great performance as a hit-man with a son. Don't let this one pass you by."
4,The BrittisH Suicide Kings,A truly funny movie that rivals pulp fiction and suicide kings in the dark comedy department. The charaters were funny and likable and a few appearacnes by rocker sting make it an entertaining movie
4,Fast paced entertainment with a serious soundtrack !,"I was hooked from from the first digit change on my DVD player! The plot is very well executed and slick. The actors are well known and not known which helps as you sit and think....""I know that guy, from somewhere!"" If you have a Dolby Digital amp, crank it up and listen to a cracking sound track which mixes with the action so well (as well as the golfing scene!) If you wish to know the true life of London's east end, watch this. Us English don't all drink tea and watch our football team struggle!"
3,Great movie but poor DVD,I first saw this movie on VHS and I loved it. Naturally as soon as I saw it on DVD I got it (the regeon 2 version). Unfortunately there were no extras besides a small interview and worst of all the sides of the picture was cut even on a widescreen TV. I'm trading mine for the VHS version>
5,Guy Ritchie is a comedic genious,"If you are sick of perverted, childish, simple humor watch Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells. It leaves behind the typical American comedy traits. It is a fresh blend of Ironicism and sarcasm turned in to a hilarious movie which has unbelievably good acting (the british are know for such skills) Know that when you buy this movie you can enjoy it everytime you watch it , it never gets old."
2,Save your money,"There are many more shoot em up movies that are more fun to watch, this one goes in circles I didn't enjoy it"
3,Not a great movie,"wasn't in HD, the sound was muffled, and the Cockney Rhyming slang was difficult to understand. It is a good plot but not very well thought through"
3,Streaming version better then DVD,Purchased the DVD and was disappointed in the quality. The streaming version has better color and is clearer. WTF.Still a good film.
4,A good film with lots of layers,"I will start out with the fact I have enjoyed a few Guy Ritchie films over the years this is one of them, This film has alot of ""English Humor"" but you still get the point it is fun to watch how everything fits together with the humor and the bit of action I guess you can call this a ""Layered Film"" when it all comes crashing around in the end.I will say this is a Crime film and it is a roller coaster ride.It dose earn its R rating, for some violance and alot of language."
3,"Not Wonderfull, but its Still Sinatra","I'm no Sinatra expert, but this box set doesnt do much for me. His voice and phrasing are what you'd expect, but the songs are lacking, in my own opinion. However, this was well before my time and songs were different then. When it comes down to it, I find his Capitol and especially the early Reprise years much more exciting and enjoyable regardless if they are ballads or swinging numbers. In short, the Columbia box isnt that much fun to listen to. Historical, yes, but not that much fun."
5,Sugar Town DVD,"I was very happy with the item and how well it was wrapped up and boxed. It arrived to me very quickly, I was very impressed."
3,Woodsy,"I got a sample of this at Sephora. It doesn't smell great coming out of the bottle. It goes on spicy and woodsy(yuk), but then fades to a more pleasant light scent which is almost undetectable( a con). I like long-lasting scents, not a scent I'd have to sniff for 10 seconds to detect. If you like floral, sweet, musky, or fresh scents do not make a purchase on this."
5,"Good, and Comfortable","This controller is very good. You can change the vibration level, which adds a nice addition. The buttons work perfect as well as the analog sticks. The analog sticks were a just a little difficult to ""click"",but overall its great!"
1,Yes Insulting!,"Yes, these last two ""mini"" series are totally insulting to V. C. Andrews name and talent. She would not have written weak, empty-headed dramas about four teenaged girls feeling sorry for themselves. Where is the shock! Where is the horror! There was a time when V. C. Andrews was beating Stephen King in horror paperback sales, there is no horror here anymore. Very sad and depressing that the Ghostwriter has begun to ignore the die-hard ADULT fans of V. C. Andrews who read her because her novels were so gothic, so dark. I am so angry with these books I could spit nails, what would Stephen King's fans do if he started writing teeny-bopper romance melo-dramas? Ms. Andrews' was a HORROR novelist, and just because she was a woman, they are altering her style to a more sudsy, soapy variety. Dispicable!"
3,Eh....,"In the second story in the Wildflowers series we hear Star's story. Star likes to put up a tough bravado but the truth is her past is filled with pain. In Dr. Marlowe's therapy group she tells the story of parents that constantly fought, and a mother that never really wanted to have kids. As she continues to tell her story Misty, Jade, and Cat may realize that Star, under her wise cracks is just like them. I found this book to be a nice read, but not really up to par with the rest of the series. I liked reading this book. But compared to the other two in the series I've already read (Misty and Jade) it was just lacking something. Neverless I'm still reading the series (Cat is on my shelf right now and I'm going to buy the full-length novel Into the garden). I reccomend this book to fans of a series but try to get it from your library instead of spending your own money on it."
4,A Black Girl on the Cover!,"Star was so surprising to me. I never would have thought that V.C.Andrews would put a Black girl on the cover. As an avid fan,an African American and avid reader of V.C. Andrews, I was shocked. I thought the story was good. It's not as good as Heaven, or Flowers in the attic, but nonetheless, it was good."
3,getting a bit better,"This was better than Misty and poor Star goes through a lot. not as exciting as I thought it would be, but at least it's about a black girl, which is different."
1,Falling Stars,"Star is the most boring of all the Wildflowers. Maybe it's because her romance with the abused boy is so clichéd, or maybe it's because the lavish houses of Beverly Hills are missing. Whatever it is, something is lacking in this story. Might it be a talented writer?"
1,a fallen star,"the reviews on here make me sad. star went through hell and back and everyone seems to hate star. i've been through hell and back just like star. i have almost died four times. been sexually abused and had several people i love die. the indifference people show star reminds me of the indifference people have towards me. people have treated me like they were thinking ""she brought all this upon herself by not being pretty enough"".it's really sad when you grow up suffering and noone has heart enough to give a damn."
3,Better than I thought it would be.,"I was suprised when I read Misty and Star. I did not think I would like the mini books but, I must say I am going out now and buy Jade and Cat. They are not as good as the original V.C. Andrews' books but they will do."
2,barely worth buying,Star is boring thats the only word for it.I really do wish they would write the older type of books. Like Flowers in the attic is the best book ever. But then it goes downhill. I think the ghostwriter would make more money if he would stop trying to target new readers and stick with the older ones.
2,Not Worth Buying,"I am such a fan of V.C. Andrews. I, like many other readers, have every book shes written (and the ghost writer). These books are so small and thin, compared to Flowers in The Attic and the other books i have with V.C. Andrews name on them. It takes no time at all to read these, i would recomend this book to someone in maybe 6th grade. Please go back to some of the older styles, like the Logan series or anything. These past 2 series just werent worth buying, i read them, but i wont read them over and over like i do her other books. Please change before you loose other avid readers of her books."
2,Where is the classic writing style of V.C. Andrews??,"I have every book written by VC Andrews and all the ones written by the ghostwriter. I must say that I am not impressed with the Orphans & Wildflowers miniseries. I think they are sort of an insult to VC Andrews' name. While I enjoyed the books in these miniseries, I could also anticipate what would happen in the book. No shocks or suprises, like her early works. Bring back the psychological horror, and the shocking suprises, the way VC Andrews would write!!"
2,These mini-series really suck,"Ok so once again it took me about an hour or two to read this book. All I can say is I'm not impressed. This book was 10 times more interesting than MISTY, which isn't saying much. These mini-series lack the shock and drama of a real Andrews book. I can't say enough how disappointed I am. I thought the Orphan series was bad but the Wildflowers are terrible! I have found nothing yet in either series that would make me gasp or swear to my husband that I'll put the book down when I read one more chapter. If not for the name V.C. Andrews on the cover I wouldn't look at it twice. I have better ideas than this ghostwriter! Maybe I should write a book..because I know what the readers want. As horrible as it may sound we want the rape and incest and anything that may make our hearts stop."
5,Star deserves 5,"Star, the second book in the Wildflowers is fantastic!!!!!! Star FINALLY gets to tell her story, of hope,heartbreak,shame, and the wish of a perfect family. She tells of a deadbeat father, and a drunken mother, parents far different from the other girls. Star maintains your interest all through out the book,as of Misty, and as in all V.C. Andrews books, it is a quick and delicious read, with a juicy ending. I can't wait to read Jade!!!!"
1,AWFUL,"This book was awful. I will continue to buy books by V. C. Andrews because I love the ones that SHE wrote (dollanganger, casteel and audrina) the cutler, landry and logan series were alright, but what is with these horrid orphans and wildflower books??? Please Mr. Neiderman, don't disgrace V. C. Andrews name and lagacy with another miniseries after this awful second one. Write books like the first three series of ghost written books, not R. L. Stine clones. If the horror and rage cannot be done again like in the books that SHE wrote, then at least return to the drama that was in the landry, cutler and logan series, I swear, these two miniseries are some of the worst books that i'm sort of emabarassed to have in my collection, but they have V. C.'s name on them, so they belong there, i just miss the old V. C. Andrews."
5,Works Like a Charm,I am new to reloading shotshells but this item made it so easy. I have already reloaded 22 boxes (550) shotshells without incident. I have saved money and it's fun to use.
5,Good re loader,Ran several hundred shells without any real issues at least none that weren't user generated. I'll buy another when this one wears out...if it wears out
2,Too synthetic!,"This is actually a re-release of a CD that originally offered several more tracks, including ""The Twilight Zone"" and a jazzy variation on ""2001.""This version offers no substitutes for the missing tracks, and the new arrangements of the surviving tunes are lifeless interpretations pumped out of a sytnthesized orchestra.The kiddies might like the upbeat tempos, though.Caveat emptor!"
1,IT STINKS,Disco sci-fi?? They got to be kidding. Stay away from this mess. The 1 star rating is false. It's the only way I could get this thru. It's really a big ZERO.
1,"LASERLIGHT--""Say no more, squire, say no more!!!""","Laserlight is the cd equivalent of ""Front Row Features"" in dvd. (Might make a good ""background score"" for a cheesy sci-fi party, though... BUYER BEWARE!)*P.S.: Overheard at Laserlight headquarters: ""Reproduction rights? Who needs RIGHTS--we'll just have some out-of-work musician living in a cheap motel perform it on his synthesizer. They'll never know the difference..."""
5,Magnificent Walker Brothers,Some of their greatest recordings. Just listen to the voice of Scott (ballad lovers take note) John and Gary both have their own sounds. It's about time they recorded more!!!!!!
5,must have,these are some of the best songs ever written. please stock up so we can spread the music.
4,Walk this way,"Walker Brothers were a mid 1960's vocal group, heartful of soul, that initially depended upon the illusion that they were Brit Invasion. With mop-tops haircuts and the attitude, they scored with an operatic version of Burt Bacharach's ""Make it Easy on YrSelf"". Next, another top 10 hit, the sublime tingling ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"" Perfect pop for aching teens yearning to shout with a whisper. There were other attempts at singles, none made more than a once/heard tossed over the shoulder and given out as radio station call, win a 45.Except, Walker Bros. had a fine distinctive vocalist in Scott Engel. Scott made a couple of interesting LPs in the late '60s worth searching for.This CD has stereo versions of the hits and a great version of an early Randy Newman song, ""I Don't Wanna Hear it Any More"" covered by Jerry Butler and bunches of others."
4,Beautiful psychosis,"In 1973/74 when I first heard this album it it was part of the mass of psychedelic concept albums that were the mainstay of underground radio. Based on the psychotic landscape laid out in the last book of the bible, Vangelis' hallucinogenic opus exemplifies a kind of musical break with reality. I lapped it up with spoon. It compares favorably with Dark Side of the Moon, though it gets a tad repetitive at times. The use of tape loops, and unusual instruments outside the guitar / bass / drum standard at the time makes it a stand out. Not to be missed is Irene Papa's eight minute vocal orgasm as she is possesed by the beast. Get this CD for a slice of history, and a trip to a time when music still had some room left for experimentation."
2,Misleading description,"This product does not come with a roller fairlead. Other than that large omission, everything was fine. Came with complete instructions and all the hardware necessary for installation. Again, DOES NOT include a roller fairlead."
5,I was extremely surpirsed i never heard of them before!!!,"my b.f told me to get this c.d for him, and he insisted on me listening to it as well, i loved it from the first song onwards! i was really surprised that this c.d hasn't been advertised that much! it's great! and its sound is so different, something that we definitely need in the muic industry!!!"
1,"You can do much, much better.","While certainly not among the worst rockstar side projects and in fact quite a refreshing change of pace from the endless navel gazing of REM, one still can't help but wonder what the point of this music is. Why not spring for a Stan Getz or John Coltrane or Ben Webster (or Hugo Montenegro for that matter)CD and hear the real thing? Why settle for the ersatz schmaltz which this CD delivers? This sounds pretty good after the basic 'alternative' band configuration of bass, drums, guitar and lead singer but then almost anything would. Rock stars parading their influences and good taste in music is a pretty empty exercise and empty is how I would describe this music."
5,Fits the bill...,"I ordered a Bachman engine and tender to place in a display case; I needed the tracks to set the scene. Naturally, the tracks ordered met the guage of the engine and tender."
5,Model train accessories,"These special tracks could not be found in any shop in Savannah, Ga. The Bradford Exchange would have charged me three times as much for the same item."
3,"Not completely satisfied, but haven't found anything better","When I wear this on my waist, the antenna pokes me in the side frequency, and eventually the antenna broke off, although the phone seemed to work just fine without it. Also when I lean over, my ribcage presses the release button, causing the phone to drop when I stand up again. However, I wouldn't use a leather case since that would interfere with the car holster that my phone locks into via the indentations on the side of the body of the phone."
1,You can't buy this -- you can only lease it for 1-2 months,"I've gone through about seven of these clips in the last two years. I can't warn you enough -- don't buy this, because you're only getting a short-term lease.I broke most of them while sitting down in my car. It turns out that it doesn't take a lot of force placed on the bottom of the phone to torque the clip apart.I'm here on Amazon searching for a sturdier solution, but in the meantime, the phone stays in my pocket."
2,convenience that broke down under pressure,"I found that this clip, after only a few months, stopped holding the phone very well. Then, after about 6 months, the piece that attached to my phone RIPPED a section off of the back of my phone. Fortunately, the phone was still under the original manufacturer's one-year warranty, but I have been using a standard case ever since."
1,IT BREAKS all the time,All this thing does is break. I have had several of them and they all broke within 2 or 3 weeks.
4,WORTH IT FOR THE CONVENIENCE,"Main problem with the clip is that the button will break before the clip does...However, it's only ... bucks and is SOOOOO convenient...I'd buy one every 2-months if necessary.However, I have had three in the last year and a half. One I lost, another I broke, the last I lost the button....Great product!!Ignore these other negative reviews...you'll love it!!"
1,Don't blame me.,"I broke this after 2 months' use; I'm retiring and don't use mobile phone too much...so, you better go with a metal one."
2,Quality Lacking,Essentially a picture book w/ limited text. Printing and design are dated and of average quality at best. A few great pics but lots of filler. Some day they will come out with a book that does justice to this fantastic sport...
5,BETTER WITHOUT SOMMERVILLE!!!!!,"This album is a must have to anyones ""HAPPY-FAG"" music collection.From C'mon C'mon to In my dreams.A CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!"
1,BLAH BLAH BLAH,THIS IS JUST TACKY DISCO FILLER. THEY SHOULD HAVE PACKED IT IN WHEN JIMMY SOMERVILLE LEFT.
3,good reference book,Good reference book. You should read it before starting your marathon training... not during...
5,Great Book for Beginers and Avid Runners,Well written book on all the aspects of running. I highly recommend it for people just starting out or seasoned runners.
1,Runners World Complete book of Running ($4.95--one),This book is a joke. It is about two inches square. Don't waste your money by ordering it. The large book which has the same cover is great but this one is a waste of your time and money to return it.
3,Good introductory text into running,"`Runner's World Complete Book of Running' is a compilation of different articles from Runners World magazine. It has 37 articles written by about 25 different authors. While the book has a lot of breath, it lacks a certain commonality between the chapters. Amby Burfoot. The editor, attempts to rectify this by writing introductions and postscripts after each chapter.With that, the book has a lot of valuable information and is an excellent overview for those that want an summary of the various aspects of running.On the other side, the book, notwithstanding its title is not `Everything you need to know to run....'. There is a lot of information and details that are left out.But if you are looking for a good introductory text into running, this is it."
2,The best advice articles from Runner&#65533;s World magazine.,"Middle of the road, middle of the pack glimpse at what Runner's World magazine does best: steer the recreational and sometimes competitive runner with conflicting advice. That said, there are no surprises here. If you want to get started with running, subscribe to the magazine and keep this book around for general, uncomplicated reference."
3,You're Better off Going to the Newsstand,"This isn't a bad book, but it's essentially for the novice runner, with a heavy slant toward the female runner. Not a bad resource tool, but you could probably look up the same or more current/detailed information faster and easier online.Essentially, this book is a collection of Runner's World magazine articles. You're better off in the long run (no pun intended) just picking up a copy of the latest issue at the newsstand."
5,Great Book!,"This is an absolutely awesome read for beginning runners. I have used much of the advice/information provided and am succeeding in my goal to become a runner. I love how they break everything down to the simplest of terms for greater understanding. I do think if you are an intermediate runner this might not appeal to you. But, as a brand new runner who has never run EVER...it's my new bible. So, glad i purchased it."
5,Complete means complete,This book has everything you are looking for. I was especially pleased with the chapter on women's safety. Written for any fitness level.
3,If you've never run before...,"Although this book was published in 2009 with a cover page that implies it contains a little of everything, old and new, I had the impression it contains a lot of common sense (wear sun lotion)and general facts (how to dress), as well as outdated information. I was a little suprised for instance to find that the author encourages the use of anti-imflammatories for injury-recovery, which are now known to slowdown healing of certain injuries (i.e. shin pain) rather than speed it up.Overall, the book is good, but each chapter is an oversimplified summary of a topic. While I appreciate any effort at sports writing, the title is a little over the top; an obvious attempt at making a buck with eyecathers but little content. For the intermediate runner interested in this sort of book, I'd recommended ""The Runner's Body"" by R. Tucker adn J. Dugas instead."
2,Generic reading...,"Very generic reading, nothing into any depth of any direction. Happy, happy so let us run. You may as well search the web for whatever information you need."
4,It was Given as a Gift,"I sent this book to my son as a birthday gift. He just took up runnign for fitness and loose weight. I think he likes it, but wanted a video game. Delivery was on time and in great condition."
3,An OK addition to a library on running,"Contrary to what the title states, this is not ""Everything you need to know to run"". The book shows painfully that it is just a collection of magazine articles. Like most magazine articles, the content has breadth but no depth. And even though there is an attempt at organizing the content in a structured way, whereever there were no articles there are holes. So if you are looking for just one complete book on running, you will do much better with either one of Bob Glover's books (depending on your level as a runner). This is a decent book with some interesting ideas and concepts (for example the article on embedded circuit training) that will complement nicely your other books."
3,An average running book,"This book has nothing new to offer. It contains a mish mash of acticles from many different runners. If you are unsure about how to train before you read this, you will be totally confused after. Different people have different opions on how to train. I would not recommend this as a first book. You'd do better to take the money and subscribe to runners world."
5,A Great Place to Start,"When I started running about a year ago, this book was my only guide. The book is loaded with valuable information that helped make my running program much, much easier. The most helpful information for me included common mistakes beginners make, injury prevention, and the mental side of running. Some reviewers complain that Runner's World magazine is better, which may be true, but what first-time runner wants to subscribe to a year's worth of magazines that arrive once a month and may or may not contain what you need at the beginner level? Burfoot's book is a great place for any beginning runner to start."
4,Very Interesting Book On The Sport Of Running,"Bought this book recently and enjoyed it. Although I am sold on low carbohydrates whereas this book preaches high carbs, I still found it very informative on everything from picking out the right shoes to stretching to the proper way to run/jog.The book is authored by an expert, Amby Burfooot, in the field. He is editor of Runner's World Magazine and has ran several dozen marathons, so I took his advice seriously and all of it made perfect sense.The book is very organized and easy to read for anyone and flows smoothly so putting it down was sometimes difficult. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to start running or has already been an avid runner."
4,A quantum field theory book,"This book covers the following subjects: 1. A brief introduction to QFT formalism 2. Feynman rules for YM thy 3. RG 4.QED 5. OPE 6. QCD 7.Spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking 8. Higgs mechanism 9. SM of EW interactions 10. Chiral anomalies 11. Eff. Lagrangians and 11. a brief introduction to susy. The derivations are in general very detailed. At the end of every chapter, there are exercices (without solutions). The appendices are very useful, specially appendix C, which collects the SM feynman rules in a concise manner."
5,75-year-old likes it,"I sent this to my healthy, but not in shape, 75-year-old mother who needed a convenient way to exercise regularly. She is a bit overweight and has not been exercising in some time. She likes the instructor very much. She started out doing 25 minutes every other day and plans to build up from there. She enjoys the cardio and stretching, but finds some of the pilates challenging. Despite this, she believes over time she will be able to do those exercises too. Highly recommended even for healthy elders over the age range indicated for."
1,Tendentious and Tedious,"Unspeakably boring and predictable, except when self-contradictory (in order to put on a play about the glories of unions, the actors defy... the actors' union). One-dimensional stock characters from the Socialist Realist roster, and are either angelic or demonic. There is no nuancing, and no growth in any of the characters.Overlong; I thought this flick would never end.Propoganda need not be dull, but it takes much more skill than Tim Robbins has to pull it off."
2,Historically Inaccurate,"The terrible irony of this movie is that it presents and challenges a ""victors write the history books"" view of the bigots investigating the WPA and then perpetuates that same view in the way it callously messes around with one of the most dramatic events in theatre history and one of the greatest stories. What is the end result? They take a true moment of triumph and fabricate it into a manufactured climax, they take 21 year old Orson Welles and turn him into a 35 year old drunkard with John Houseman as his straight-man. Yes, there are some very touching moments in the movie and Bill Murray is great but it would have worked better if it had just been the truth."
5,fly on the wall history,"A fun chance to be a ""fly on the wall"" at a moment in theatrical history. Obviously some liberties taken with the plot, but it does put an era and its problems front and center in a memorable fashion."
3,A page out of our history,"I was most interested in the genre of the 30's and 40's-- What was happening and the characters who stopped the music because of prejudice and unrestrained labeling causing drastic impact on the genius of American life; the birth of the labor unions and the reasons for;the sad and arrogant behind the scene ""movers and shakers"" of that era; the state of the Union at that time period. This cast of stars depicted the personalities involved in a most changing/ground breaking time in American life before WWII. It was entertaining yet had a noir undertone of seriousness and darkness that required hard choices. The DVD, purchased on Amazon, was new and at a great price with a timely delivery. I recommend it!"
1,"i guess we wont be seeing a film version of ""juno"" or ""reuben reuben"" in the near future","tim robbins is oh so right in his political points of view; its a damn shame that hes such an amateurish actor and (here) director. he manages here to trivialize one of the most memorable moments of mid-20th century american theater, and to portray as buffoons a number of persons of vastly greater talent than tim robbins, among them orson welles, john houseman, and marc blitzstein. (not to even mention the hatchet job on nelson rockefeller, who was portrayed far more fairly in ""frida"", arising from the same incident -- hmm, i guess i DID mention it). the film is sophomoric and replete with ham performances from alot of actors who should know better, with only bill murray acquitting himself well. and most annoying of all is the scant amount of the blitzstein score that is used, further proof of mr robbins trusting his own talents ahead of those of a genuine artist. one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time."
3,NYC in 1930s,"Tom Robbins' film is depicting time in US history that affected art in a big way. It is 1930s, country is coming out of depression while Europe is in turmoil. As government is establishing funds for theatres around the country, there is also persecution of communist symphatizers going on. Fascists regimes from Europe are too busy negotiating steel prices for their growing military demands and the best way to establish such ""business"" relationships is thru ""selling"" art. As rich like Hurst and Rockefeller are accumulating modern art and misplaced DaVinci's in their living rooms and placing them above fireplaces; Diego Rivera with a help of Frieda Kahlo is painting his famous mural that will be taken down shortly after it's unveiling. This film is saturated with stars and the topic is too complex and too broad for 90 minute movie. Robbins has attempted to tackle too much and it shows. Interesting part of US history shown thru an artist's point of view."
2,Made no sense!,"This movie was confusing. It sets up a wonderful beginning with a bunch of people ( a playwright, a prostitute, a millionare, etc.),and you expect them to link together somehow before the end of the film, but they don't. The writer of this film needs to be shot, but it was directed beautifully. also every actor and actress dilivered a wonderful performance. If it helps any it would have been great if I could have made any sense out of it! :)"
1,Hollyweird does Marx,"This is it folks! Proof positive that the Hollywood elite live in a fantasy land of political naiveté. Cradle Will Rock is so horrendously dull, so stupendously pretentious, so predictably and nauseatingly left-wing it took Herculean willpower to prevent the bile from rising to my throat as I watched it. Just short of the end I couldn't stand it anymore and turned it off. Why do wealthy entertainers like Tim Robbins and wifey Susan Susan Sarandon feel it is their birth-right and moral obligation to reeducate we unwashed masses in the glories of Marxism through the medium of film? More importantly what wealthy Capitalist looney would put up the money to make this garbage anyway? Tie-died yuppie Communist philosophy does not make good theater or good movies!"
1,Best Forgotten,"Directors and writers have a learning curve and this was part of Mr. Robbin's. What did he do right? The film has a professional polish to its acting and editing. What's bad? Under dramatized scenarios follow one another like beads on a string. This goes on for two whole hours. I could only stand to watch it in segments. And of course it's politically skewed way to the Left. There is no middle class represented amongst the characters-none of the 85% who stayed working at their jobs after 1929. Characters are either 1) out of work, starving or struggling, or 2) government employees working under the New Deal as they wait for the reactionary Republican funding axe to fall, or 3) the mega-rich eating expensive meals at Twenty-One, laughing about life at the lower depths as they make business deals with Mussolini. I bought my copy used for 99 cents. They're easy to find at that price. On the back of the cardboard package is a thumbs up from Roger Ebert."
1,CRADLE WILL BORE!,"It is not often that I turn off a DVD I spent $4.OO on renting, but the agony, the brutal and insufferable agony that this film gave to me is unbelievable. Tim Robbins simply does not know how to make a movie. He belongs (barely) in front of the camrea, but never, under any circumstances, should he be behind one! First he insulted us by trying to make us feel pity for a rapist-killer in DEAD MAN WALKING, and now he tries to pass off this abomination, this complete waste of film, as entertainment. This was not dramatic, scary, interesting, funny, cute, sexy, sad, romantic or anything other then TERRIBLY BORING AND POINTLESS. This movie is not even worthy enough to be a rabid dog's chew toy. My hatred for this film is astounding, almost as astounding that people bothered to make such an odious piece of manure. Who needs NyQuil when youv'e got this stupid thing!"
1,SUCKS,this is expensive it ripped apart when i put my gun in there and took 1 month for me to get it
2,first listen...wasn't crazy about it,"Kerry Livgren is a great musician and composer, no doubt about it, and I have been a huge fan of Kerry and Kansas for almost 40 years. I understand this was a project that he could call his own, as he played all of the music on every instrument. There-in lies the problem...he is not as skilled as these other instruments as other folks for whom these instruments are their primary focus. This includes of course, the members of the original Kansas. What I heard where rudimentary drums and bass, and most of everything else that that is not guitar or keyboard. Kerry is a great guitarist (imo), and the guitar work is far above the rest of the instruments. Unfortunately, what it sounds like to me, is that he had to limit his compositions to music that he could actually play. None of these compositions compare to the songs he used to write for Kansas. I will keep listening...and will have it on my shuffle, and hopefully some of the tracks will grow on me."
4,Strong work!,This is a very nice album by Kerry Livgren. Highly recommended for people who love progressive rock.
4,Oil-rich WaitePhillips becomes richer by giving it all away.,"This is a fascinating story of Waite Phillips and his dreams of living a cowboy life out west, his bond with twin brother Wiatt, and his life as an oilman, wildcatter and millionare. Most importantly, it is the story of a man with the wisdom to understand that ""A man keeps nothing unless he gives it away"". His gifts to the Boy Scouts of America, hospitals, universities, and the city of Tulsa stand as a testiment to his wisdom and love of people. I recommend this book more often than any other. It should be required reading for all."
2,Bummer,"It is adorable but won't stay on her head. Band is tooo big. Wish I had known it was flat and unsupported. Made both Grandmother and Princess unhappy. On to find one more crown-like, that will rest a little more on top of her head."
2,oversized headband tiara crown,My neice loved the headband but had to take it off for it kept falling off. It matched her outfit perfectly.
3,Basic beauty info,"Basic beauty that's covered in this book: Shampoo and maintaining your hair, tresses, sprays and gels, brushes and combs and such tools for hair, blow drying and curling irons, curly hair and perms, women of color, coloring hair, nail care, and skin care. So it gives the bare bones basics of beauty and I would reccomend it to pre-teens and teens or adults that need to learn the basics of beauty.This book is written in a question and answer format and covers basic common sense beauty info. If you want more than common sense basics, then do not buy this book. The other reader was right it doesn't go into much in depth. If you want a beauty book with more depth I would suggest checking out one of bobbi brown's beauty books."
2,Larrea 2007,"Appears less effective than a competitor's product from Larrea Biosciences, Inc., which I have used for almost 2 years. Also, being in uncoated tablet form, instead of capsule form, Chaparrel's strong odor contaminates the taste of other pills when stored in a weekly pill organizer. I tried Chaparral because it's considerably cheaper than the other, but I will not reorder it."
4,3 Romances for the Price of 1,Everybody gets a happy ending. I thought it was well-written. Kind-of nice that all the loose ends get wrapped up in the end - maybe a little bit improbable. I wish the villains had suffered more. Someone as evil as Vivienne deserved a page or two with details about her comeuppance. I thought the heroine (Tori) could have been a little more likeable. It was a fast read.
3,HAD some funny moments,Some of the reviewers are abit harsh on this film. Now its not caddyshack but this had a funny premise and its share of laughs. HACKMAN plays an EX POPULAR PRESIDENT who somehow gets in a mayor race in MOOSEPORT vs a local PLUMMER. Some of the reviewers obviously need a feather to make them laugh but if you take this film for what it is you will enjoy it. I was never bored watching it and thought some of the situations that developed were quite humorous and funny. I mean an ex PRESIDENT running in a tight race for mayor vs a local plummer is funny to me.
4,small town genre,"9/12/08 Actors*: Romano,Hackman, Harden,Tierney,Baranski,Torn and Savage help to elevate what is considered atypical jargon and scenarios in the way small towns and its people are depicted...There are no real surprises expected on how the movie will end .The expression, there are no small parts just small actors ring true here... this cast of *strong actors* & a couple of the second bananas are able to keep the scenes from being mediocre. 9/12/08 abj"
1,"Ray, you ruined this movie.","Simply put, Mooseport is a bad movie. Far fetched, not funny, slow-paced and boring. A waste of 90 minutes of my life. This is why this movie went straight from the theaters to DVD and HBO. Ray Romano's poor acting (as ""Handy"" the plumber) in particular ruined the movie. Romano was dull, lifeless and easy to root against. If it was not for Gene Hackman, who as usual, does a great job, I would have quit after the first 30 minutes. If you want to check this out, I would wait until the DVD hits the 5 dollar rack at your local Wal-mart/Target."
1,A LIMP OVERDRAWN SITCOM THAT'S JUST NOT FUNNY,"The comic firepower of ""Welcome to Mooseport"" sounds more like a whimper than a bang, thanks in no small measure to an instantly forgettable performance by the eternally nagging Romano. The girl-friend squabble (how novel) between Gene Hackman and Romano's characters is too dragged out and unbelievably phony. A faulty sitcom stretched into nearly two excruciating hours, almost, but that doesn't really matter as every twist and turn can be seen from a mile away. Which is sad because most of the cast has done quite well elsewhere and was just tragically frittered away on this wet noodle."
4,A Must Buy,"If you are a Ramano fan, this is a must-buy. Great movie with a great script and moral. Worth the money!"
2,"A fun rental, but I regret buying it even for $10....","Monroe Eagle Cole (Gene Hackman) is a retired two-term President who was the most popular in US history--with approval ratings of 85! Because he lost his house in Baltimore in a divorce that happened while he was in the Oval Office, he's moving to Mooseport and his summer home.Handy Harrison (Ray Romano) is the town hardware store owner and plumber. What doesn't stick to the ex-Prez seems to be permanently glued to Handy.Through a series of weird twists, Eagle and Handy end up in a Mayoral race for Mooseport. The movie's full of adolescent gags, throw-away lines, and an unbelievable plot. Still, it was funny, but not worth seeing again."
5,Great movie!,"I loved this movie! It's not the most intelligent of romantic comedies ever written, but I really enjoyed it all the same. I am a big fan of Ray Romano anyway from watching ""Everybody Loves Raymond""."
1,A poor movie,"Welcome is a regular, predictable movie. The jokes are not funny. They always fall flat (whenever they're able to arrive.) Ramano's character has no emotions, I found myself rooting for Hackman's egotistical former prez. This is a waste of 2 Oscar winner. Hackman & Harden should be ashamed to be in this mess."
2,"It's not the worst film ever, but...","Being a fan of Everybody Loves Raymond and of Gene Hackman, I was looking forward to this movie. But when you find yourself thinking in a movie ""this is stupid"", you've wasted your money. I could not believe that Ray Romano and Maura Tierney were a couple. No chemestry. And, all I can say about the movie without revealing anything is that certain plot points were implausible. I can only suspend disbelief so far. The one exception to this movie is Marcia Gay Harden who is, as always, great. So if you simply have to see it, wait for the DVD. Otherwise, just wait until it plays on cable."
2,A brief comment,"This light-hearted piece of fluff had potential but just doesn't quite get off the ground. Hackman's performance is about the only bright spot in the movie. There are a few moments that are truly funny, but too many of them just fall flat. Unless you're really a fan of Romano, Hackman, or Tierney, or ""Leave It to Beaver"" reruns are your only other choice on the tube, you might want to pass this one by. On the other hand, ""Leave It to Beaver"" at least has some historical importance which I doubt this movie will in another 50 years."
1,So bored with the lame humor; I fell asleep...,"It's amazing how many copies of this dvd were available to rent in the movie store... I thought it must be pretty good for them to have purchased so many copies for rental. I don't watch tv sitcoms, and I just reinforced my reason why...LAME, LAME, LAME. Poorly written and unimaginative script. This could have been a weak TV episode. I bet Gene Hackman was embarassed to be associated with this."
1,Very Disappointing!!,"Let's see, two Oscar winners, a successful comedian with a hit show, this would work, right? Wrong! DEAD WRONG! This movie is a bust from the very beginning opening sequence with the streaking jogger! This film was not funny at all. The only sequence that gave me a chuckle was the golfing match where Romano is counting the strokes. Other than that this movie was a huge disappoinment! They could have done so much with the material if they had a funnier script and more moose. Give a big thumbs down to the director Donald Petrie, who was wrong in the development and execution of the film. This film could have used Mel Brooks or even Carl Reiner at the helm. Overall, stay away from this film!"
3,An objective view of the life-afterlife border,"If you would like listen to the experiences of 25 million people who came close to the border of life, clean from the autdor's own feelings, you will be pleased with every page of this research by Gallup. Gallup neatly classifies similarities in these accounts and helps you form your own view or compare it with your own experiences. This is a book about near death and out-of-body experiences, that you do not have to ask yourself the common question ""is this fact or fiction"", as you read through other people's experiences. I found it most valuable and interesting to read."
5,Refugee Camp back in this!,"Y'all gotta' check out this new joint from Forte! His intelligent lyrics are always phat (proof: We Tryin' to Stay Alive, Wild Cowboys (which he wrote)) but his beats and unique flow is what keeps true heads noddin'. Forte is gonna' blow up! You heard it here. Check tha' date!"
4,Street Science,"I sat through the whole CD without skipping a track and started listening again for the knowledge after grooving to it.Forte's lyrical twang keeps your head bopping while laying down some knowledge. He blends a fun, hip hop, at times commercial sounding flavor with his intellectual savy, philosphical banter, and street knowledge.The real strengths of his album are some powerful one liners which are tied together by some questionable themes. With this in mind, hip hop heads all over will be quoting Forte's phrases such as ""feeling pressure like a black where only whites can sit."" If not, they're missing out on some powerful symbolic, poetic language which Forte handles skillfully.A great album which promotes self-affirmation and intellectualism in the Hip-Hop nation... a much needed break from misguided notions connected to money, power, and love."
3,Great cast...................Rousing finale,"Slow to start, but final battle makes up for it. Really conveys feeling of terror and heroism which Alamo defenders must have felt. Hunnicutt and Carlson make believable Crockett and Travis."
4,A Republic Masterpiece,"This is the film that caused John Wayne to break with Republic Pictures, and probably the biggest film they ever made. Shot at Brackettville Texas (the same place Wayne shot his Alamo), this epic follows the later years of James Bowie (Hayden). The action scenes are well staged , and Ernest Bognine is great as Mike Radden. Republics Truecolor is enhanced in this video, but the soundtrack suffers, as Republic only recorded a standard mono track. Overall a good edition to anyones collection, and historically more acurate than other (ALAMO) films. Good supporting cast, including academy award nominee Arthur Hunnicutt, and the musical score of Max Steiner."
2,Product as Described; Delivered in Pieces,"Although the product is good, the packaging TWICE caused the staples to be a pile of individual staples and unusable. The weight of the flimsy cardboard box they are packed in broke apart and mashed up staples were everywhere. They need to be purchased locally rather than shipped."
3,Zen for Christians,"I liked this for it's simplicity. It went in to the reasons why they can work together in plain language. I learned more about both than I knew before and it clarified the differences between the 2, ie Christianity is a religion and Zen is not.I loaned it to my preacher to help me define where I am without an argument."
5,ALL THE BEST!!,"There is a lot of great songs on these 3 cds. If your are a big Cash fan or just starting to listen to him you will have a lot of music too listen to. This was my first Johnny Cash album i bought and was very happy with it. The more i listen to these cds the more of his music i what'd to hear.If you planing on to buy more of his music (like me) i would like to recommend these box sets The Man In Black (1954-58) [BOX SET], The Man In Black (1959-62) [BOX SET], The Man In Black (1963-69) [BOX SET], Come Along & Ride This Train [BOX SET]. These box set have outtakes and alternate takes witch are excellent to hear they are a little high price but well worth it. If you have the money save your self the 31 bucks and put it to one of these."
4,A nicely composed piece of science future,The Wall at the Edge of the World is a dynamic piece of work. It centers around one man's mental awakening in a society of mind communicators and conditioners. The novel unfolds an intricate storyline through quiet complexities of thought and reason. It imposes the question of; If it is good for most of society is it always good for all of the people
4,One of my favorites,I have read almost all of the Alias prequel and APO novelizations and I would have to say that this one is definately in the top 3 for favorites. It is interesting and edgy and keeps you guessing until the end.
5,A Nearly Lost Gem,"I have little to add to the superior review here (from the year 2000) but wanted to confirm the extra special quality and listenability of this particular Eric Burdon album (produced by the famous Tom Wilson, who was so formative in the early careers of Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, and Frank Zappa, plus the Blues Project, Nico, Velvet Underground, Ill Wind, and others).Recordings such as this are bejeweled artifacts of an historically creative time in popular music and should not be lost to listeners searching deeper into the era. My take: there is enchanting listening to be had within here!"
5,"A complete system, thorough and effective","I was worried that this would be another time management book that would tell me how to arrange my day using a planner, but boy was I wrong!This book is a very thorough look at how to create intense focus in your life and business and it shows you exactly what to work on and when. The system tha thte author lays out it very sensible and disarmingly simple to implement. I particularly found the chapters on how to focus, how to think critically, how to think creatively and Envisioneering were especially powerful. I've already begun implementing the Power Hour concept. This book is chock full of great ideas, what I love is that you can turn to just about any page in the book and get very valuable information that you can implement. The book is complete with checklists and step by step lists that you can use to create change quickly."
2,Very little substance,"I found this book to be be repetitive, fluffy and lacking in practical suggestions. I felt like he was saying, in order order to focus on what you're doing, just focus until the task is done. He doesn't give suggestions on how to facilitate getting into the ""zone"" except intuitive things like being in a quiet place with your phone off. He doesn't give suggestions on how to manage workflow. The trademarked Fearsome Focus concept seemed pretty watery to me, a marketing ploy on the author/publisher's part that isn't worth its fanfare. David Allen's ""Getting Things Done""Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity, on the other hand, is chock-full of non-intuitive practical suggestions that could give us a chance of actually changing our habits and productivity levels."
4,Fantastic!,I was lucky enough to get both this book and Getting Things Done by Dave Allen. Together they helped me t boost my productivity by 200% and do it stress free!You won't regret the investment in yourself.
1,Perhaps I missed the point,"I bought the book at the suggestion of Harv Eker, whom I respect. However, I found this book to be dogmatic and lacking the inspiration that I expected. I found that many of the chapters were dry, brief, and did not connect with me. I had the sensation of having someone who had heard ""this is how to be productive with your time"" from someone else and was passing on the cliff notes. Instead of this book, I would recommend Brian Tracy's Goals! - which gave me much more inspiration and practical exercises."
2,Padded and poorly written,"I bought this book based on the strength of six five-star ratings. Alas, it was a disappointment. There are a few good nuggets of wisdom here, but maybe a magazine article's worth, certainly not a complete book. It's barely 200 pages long and this number was padded through the liberal use of wide white space breaks between paragraphs and a huge number of dot-point lists. It is also poorly written, full of redundant phrasing, non-sequiturs, and improper use of language. Note to the author (and to the author's editor, if there was one): the proper term is ""risk averse"" not ""risk adverse."" If you're looking for truly practical advice on improving your productivity, I'd recommend any of David Allen's books over this one."
5,Bow ring.,"I was so pleased with the ring and the customer service as well. I received the ring damaged and immediately contacted the websites customer service, the response was quick and very helpful. I received the new ring very quickly, free of charge, and sent the damaged one back. I've had the ring for about a year now and have had no problems at all. It's so elegant and classy I always wear it."
1,Is this a joke??,"I can only wish I could alter my past and have rented something else. I can honestly say the original Butterfly is one of my favorite movies. This ""sequel"" is not even shadow of the original. It seemed that the altered outcome kept getting dumber and dumber. At one point I asked myself if this was a comedy. Sadly it wasn't."
4,I really liked this movie,"The main theme of this movie is ""It is our past that brought us to the present"". If your life is full of ""what if you would had done this"", then you would not be in the same place you are now in the present. This is a very simple concept. This movie takes the ""gift of ability to change the past to affect the present"" scenerio and does it well. The acting of the actors were great and very believable. I don't know why all of the ranting and raving is from the other reviewers, maybe they can't just sit down and enjoy a movie for what it is and accept it for what it is trying to say. I recommend this movie to anyone that likes the concept of ""what we do in the past brings us to the present and also affects us in the future""."
2,Lousy.,"I was not satisfied with this movie. I did not expect it to be similar to the first version of The Butterfly Effect. However, what I did expect was that the film would at least do a decent job of telling the story in an effective manner similar to the first. It failed, however. The acting was lousy. The script was poor. The movie was an embarrassment and should have had substantial revisions. Unfortunate."
2,Interesting.......,"Ok, Bottom line, i did'nt barely remember the first one...so this cameas sort of a new movie. I knew the movie was in trouble when it started just too slow...but finally as things got moving i found the movie fairly good and kept me awake till the end. Its not the best, but its certainly not as bad as how the other critics saw it."
2,"Good storyline basis, bad execution.","At the end of this film, you are left with the thougt that life is too short, and I wasted it watching this film. The storyline starts out with good intentions, and had the potential to be a good sequel, but the tale wears thin, and it becomes very obvious where it is going to go, and then when you think it is going to go bad, it just ends, in a very corny way. I would highly recommend if you must see this, borrow it, but try not to pay for it even at rental prices...unless you get it as a freebie."
3,The Buttfly Effect 2 ok,I think that it was allright but the first was better and more understand able. as the plot did get better towords the end the ending was not so good though. but too some one that like the first one and is a real fan of the first then then second is too buy for you collection. but if they make a third one I dont think that I will buy it. thats all
5,Butterfly Effect 2,i seen part 1 and loved it. and then i read the reviews of people saying that this movie sucked. but i took a chance because Erica Durance is in it and purchased this movie...and i absolutely loved this film... i personally liked this one better than the first... i cant wait till part 3
2,BUTTERFLY'S WINGS CLIPPED,"This movie is not so much a sequel to the original, but simply a film that borrows that film's premise and tries to rejuvenate it with different touches. Ultimately, it doesn't work because the script and pacing are weak, and although Eric Lively and Erica Durance are charming in their roles, their thespian skills don't really convince us they're sincere in their performances. There is also no real explanation for Lively's abilities and when he makes his final ""return"", why doesn't he just not go to work and then maybe...well, don't want to spoil it. It's not a rotten movie, but it's merely another direct to video release that won't stay with you too long."
3,happy,"The movie was ok, it will never compare to the first butterfly effect.This one had nothing to do with the first one"
2,"Not THAT bad, but pretty close, I guess","Aww, what the heck...I watched the whole thing, so what can I tell ya? I did find it watchable, obviously. I read a few reviews and didn't see a mention of one thing I found hilarious:About the 67 minute 40 second mark, the lead character says to his girlfriend, who has been shot, ""Oh Julie."" He then sits down next to her and clearly says, ""JUDY!"" :-) I have seen a lot worse, many of which I didn't finish."
3,"We've all walked now, and are free","I would like to explore this some more someday, but it sounds actually not bad at all. ""If You Got To Make A Fool Of Somebody"" is the most commercial sounding song ever cranked out by these guys. ""Frank and Curt"" is a wonderful rocker filled with some angst it sounds like. ""Turtledove"" has a soundscapes feel to it, and ""Calypso"" is feeling like caribbean music. Most of the group left by this time, and looking to start thier new adventures. This was what was left over, and is alot better sounding than the last Monkees album."
2,Little more than a party trick.,"There's no denying the verbal virtuosity of this work, where Bok manages to write poetry in which each section is written using only one vowel, and yet manages to go on and on at great length. Yet there is really nothing sublime about this poetry; it is merely a very, very clever stunt. If you set aside the fact that Bok uses only one vowel in each section, and examine the work for other poetic merits, it has few. It is little more than a tongue twister or a very high class form of doggerel. I was unable to finish the work."
4,"Excellent examples, but poor review of negative topics.","In Megatrends Asia, Naisbitt does an excellent job in presenting the next eight major shifts taking place in Asia. His use of precise examples and interviews clarifies the points he is trying to express. For example, he sites specific countries and their new infrastructure projects. He presents specific statistics, like with Asian credit and the number of credit cards being issued. Acer Group is mentioned as an example of the rise in Asian brand names.However, I do not believe Naisbitt give adequate defense to the negative issues surrounding these shifts and their impact on the region. He briefly mentions pollution, environment, human rights, but he does not put much emphasis on them. Overall, I think Naisbitt presented a positive and fairly accurate prediction of the future. But he (we) should not ignore the inevitable negatives surrounding these shift in Asia.END"
2,DISSAPOINTING AND ILL - REASERCHED,"this book was a major dissapointed for me, especially form someone with such a big reputation. On the basis of this , i shall NOT read his other material.it was quite obvious that mr. naisbitt had not researched the area properly and some of the very unique facts about asian busness culture. I sensed that his glossy rather superficial style would be the books undoing in the end and so i was right. since then , events in asia have proven him wrong, something i am not gloating about , but regret since this could have been avoided had naisbitt covered the subject with more depth. if you are looking for futurology boooks then , there are many better books than this - for a start try "" the great reckoning "" - james dale davidson and will. rees-mogg."
5,"""ALANE"" is simply the best song ever by an African !","The first time that I listened to ""ALANE"", I was hooked to it immediately. Till today, I've never lived through a day without listening to it. You know, the more you hear it, the more you like it. Even though its in native Cameroonian, its superbly suited for western audiences. Wes has made a bold move by coming out with a track in his native language, and he still manages to score a huge hit with it! Hats off to Wes! I can guarantee that anyone who hears it for the first time will get hooked to it, believe me. KEEP UP THE FANTASTIC WORK AND ALL THE BEST TO YOU FOR THE FUTURE, WES!"
5,Shoot out all the people outta there listening,"I dont know what to say bout this album. Apart from Jazz music I am too much hooked with music of Traffic for quite a long time. A long time back I have heard Low spark and high heeled boys and can't even forget the tune. But this album is something which has really surpussed ""Low Spar...."". Every Friday evening I chill out in night with Roll Right Stones which has become a mantra to me. The expression of Steve Windwood is something very delicate which once heard can't be erased from mind...."
5,Superb,"Always liked Traffic and Steve Winwood. Originally bought this on vinyl, then cassette. Just completing and updating my cd collection."
2,follow up effort,I first heard traffic in 72 with low spark thhis is the follow up record it is a lackluster album.try the new winwood cd.mike
5,Classic Traffic!!,"I already have this on album, but on the cd they seemed to have improve on the quality of the original recording I am a big fan of the Traffic so I do like most of their music, this cd is a good one for the collection."
5,It's all good,"This item was a gift to my son for Christmas.As it was a last minute idea, it arrived with plenty of time to spare, thanks to exceptionally fast delivery.The toy has provided alot of entertainment.Thanks."
4,Futurist Realms of Reality.,"The perception of future and its expansive chain of inconsistency, topics explored here and shaped by technical playing, forgotten and yet superior to a band that have similar lyrical views but inferior musicianship or within the nu-metal mold, I'm reffering to Fear Factory, just think of the level they would never reach.Also this album is the least consistent of their career, yet it manages to be superior to the so-called masterpiece Demanufacture. That makes it clear, and be blown away by ""From this Day Forward"", ""NEMESIS"", ""Cybervoid"" and of course ""Carnivore Mothermouth""."
4,A real blessing..,"Having known and loved Renaissance's music for quite some time, I was uncertain what to expect from Annie on her own. I shouldn't have worried. Beauty, feeling, her amazing voice, everything is still there. The music is a little less classical/folk-influenced and more diverse. ""Love Lies Love Dies"" annoys me a little.. probably because the word ""love"" pops up in almost every line. The same is true of ""A New Life"" - possibly the most cliched song Annie has ever done. But these are minor complaints. When you're in the right mood, this music is simply perfect."
2,Annie goes down the elevator,"This was one of the biggest disappointments in my music buying history. The first track is acapella which proves she can sing, but we already knew that; can we have some real rock music please! Without rock influences around her Annie drifted into some kind of new age lounge act. It sounds like elevator music. There are about 3 songs I liked which is why I gave it 2 stars.I have never been able to listen to the whole CD in one sitting since I bought it. The word Renaissance on the cover is misleading. That is not what you will get here."
3,Blessed Be,"Annie has always had an angelic voice,is still fabulous,but who are the other members of this ""Renaissance""(it is actually credited to Annie Haslam's Renaissance,not as a pure solo effort. While her voice soars,is soothing and this makes for a great meditational piece of music,the musical backing lacks what vintage Renaissance had(chops I guess are out of style). This is more new agey than prog,which is good and bad (for old Renaissance fans).She was never a writer;I don't think she plays any instruments,and I don't see any songwriting credit on this (my copy is a promo). So, who is really behind all this ?"
5,A superb album by a sublime voice.,Her range and beauty of tone is unrivalled. A major talent that should be releasing MORE albums. Any collection from Renaissance to this solo album clearly showcases her amazing abilities and achievements. We all would love to hear this gorgeous voice more often.
3,Very nice work,"Having been very UNimpressed with Annie's second solo album released in 1989, I was pleasantly surprised by this third offering. Her voice, of course, is as perfect as ever and the songs are more varied and better arranged than previous albums. Best songs: Blessing in Disguise; Love Lies, Love Dies; A New Life."
2,"Good Book?. . . ummmmm, not so much.","If you're looking for a bad book about a good team, this is the book for youI'm a die hard Mets fan. I was 16 in 1986; the best age you can be when your team has a season like that. It was truly a season of baseball like it oughta be.Jeff Pearlman spins a fairly entertaining account of the events and characters that made up that magical Mets season, but unfortunately I found myself fighting through it 10 or 15 pages at a time. As I battled through, it occurred to me that perhaps Mr. Pearlman was just missing 3 crucial members from his project team.1) Proofreader2) Editor3) Fact CheckerThis could have been a good book if it had ben edited properly. Sadly it was not, and the result is a barely readable book with real live factual errors.If you are a Mets fan and can't get enough of memories of '86, pick it up for an entertaining read. If you are not a Mets fan, don't bother."
1,Don't bother buying--give your money to charity,"I was really looking forward to this book being published. Boy, was I disappointed after I read it!! I agree with others that this account is simply an average retelling of the Mets championship. While some of the ""bad boy"" stories are gossipy and titillating to some degree (if you like that sort of thing), the book ultimately left a very foul taste in my mouth--both for the publication and the 1986 Mets."
3,"A Good, Quick Read","Stylistically, this is pretty conventional sports-writing, with lots of overwrought melodrama and awkward analogies (""The Boston right-hander had as much right pitching in Game 4 of the World Series as Spuds McKenzie [sic] did distributing political advice""). But Pearlman is a decent story-teller, and as a long-time Mets fan, with fond memories of 1986, I found the story compelling. While hardly comprehensive, the book offers interesting behind the scenes perspectives, albeit with a strong emphasis on the most negative aspects. Even more general baseball fans, with no emotional ties to the year or team, should find much of interest here. And, of course, it's endlessly fascinating (and fruitless) to look at the young Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry, and the amazing chemistry of this team, and wonder what might have been."
2,"great story, badly written","The story of the '86 Mets is a compelling one. Too bad such a pathetic writer chose to tell it. How can this guy be a professional writer? Barely a page goes by without some example of bad technique, poorly chosen metaphors and borderline purple prose. And the text is rife with sexist tripe. Only read if you have a high tolerance for poor writing."
4,A Fun Read,"This is by no means a wonderfully written book. It never probes too deeply, it is not overwhelmingly analytical, and it doesn't really stand out above other sports books. However, it is a very fun, fast read. Pearlman picked a good subject in the 1986 Mets and the stories that emerge from the season are pretty wild. I enjoyed, if for no other reason than the fact that I could plow through it without thinking."
5,Great Read,"I was only 2 years old when the Mets won it all in 1986, but reading this book made me feel like I lived through it all. Pearlman does a fantastic job bringing the highlights (and lowlights for that matter) of the 1986 season to life in full detail. A must read for any Mets fan or any fan of baseball."
4,i liked it,"i reviewed this book for my college newspaper, and thought it was very funny and well-written. I wish the Mets now (my team) were as interesting."
4,very good book,"I thought the book was a fun read with lots of exciting details. But I won't let my 7-year-old son hear some of the more graphic details just yet,."
4,Good Book for Met fans,If you are a Met fan you will enjoy this book. I knew this team was a wild bunch but I certainly learned a lot more about this team.
5,"The Bad Guys Won! A SAeason of brawling, Boozing, Bimbo-chasing, and Championship Baseball, etc.","An enjoyable quick read that brought back memories of a very entertaining talent rich team. At that time the Mets were available in Massachusetts on cable and I watched a lot of their games both because the National League is a better brand of ball and Tim McCarver a top notch analyst. The local Red Sox are something that I try and ignore. Thus the final match-up was a no way can the Mets lose thought. Of course without the interesting umpire calls Houston would have beaten the Mets. Mayber that is a subject for a book as there have been numerous out and out bad calls in all sports.The sadness of exceptional squandered talent, i.e. Gooden and Strawberry along with the inside perspective on the players with their warts keeps the book both informative and entertaining."
2,An easy read,"because it never goes very deep. Basically a rehash of the '86 season, with a side order of dirt."
5,If Kevin Elster were a book!,"If Kevin Elster were a book, he'd be ""The Bad Guys Won."" I write this because Kevin is my favorite player ever, and this is one of my favorite baseball books. I read it in three days, and loved it very much."
5,If you're a Met fan from the mid 80's era...,"You'll love this book if you were a Met fan from the 80's. It clearly recounts the horrible early 80's seasons that were that laid the foundation. Key games and moments from the 1986 regular season are covered... as are the playoffs and the exciting World Series vs. the Bosox. The utter demolition of what was supposed to be a dynasty is also detailed.However the key part of this book is the background on the players themselves. Definitely play ball hard... drink hard type players. Many were obnoxious and the team had a strut the rest of the league hated. Moments of both incredible selfishness and incredible graciousness are shown.All this brought me back, replaying the season and events in my mind. Bring back Mookie!"
5,Great Book,"I'm the type of guy who likes to read only the sports section, but I must admit,that this was one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. It goes into great details and discusses the off field antics that made the 86' Mets so notorious. If you are looking for a great read, pick it up!"
5,Can't go wrong,"Chronologies of sports teams, especially in the great(est) game of baseball, can't miss. This was a wonderful book from start to finish, replete with anecdotes, stories, commentary and introspection. Pearlman simply does a magnificent job, especially for someone who was a teenager in 1986."
4,"Bad Guys, Great Team","This book was fun and interesting.In the 20 years since ""Game 6"", it was great to get some insite into these ""hero's""."
4,I didn't think itd be THIS funny ...,... but it was. I cracked up many times reading what must be my new favrote baseball book. How can anyone ever look at Kevin Mitchell with a straight face again?
5,A enjoyable book about the Mets !?!?,"Wow. What a great read.Being from Australia, the 1986 World Series was my 6th year of watching baseball. (At the time these were the only 5 - 7 games televised to Australia each year).I was hoping Boston would win due to the number of years since they had won a World Series. I still remember watching the 6th game at about 2am when that ball rolled through Bill Buckner's legs. Terrible!!This book gave a good insight into the Mets & their opponents that year.I have to give special mention to the chapter on Bill Buckner; before the ball went between his legs. He will always be remembered for this one play. Jeff Pearlman did a wonderful thing writing that chapter to give us a whole picture of this player. It was one of the highlights of the book. Great writing."

3,"Interesting and informative, but lacks depth","This beautifully-illustrated book covers many of the ways color can be utilised in an accessible, easy-to-follow manner. Of particular interest to me was the section on feng shui and the 5 Chinese elements, as it provided a comprehensive (although somewhat basic) description of some of the main concepts involved. It also covers crystal healing, chakras, color breathing, and, intriguingly, color foods. It is a lovely book, and although I would recommend it to those beginning to explore color, it's not for 'color-pofessionals', as it won't teach you anything you don't already know."
1,Don't bother with the Kindle edition,"Apparently a direct transcription of the physical book's text, the Kindle edition of this play is very poorly formatted. Line-breaks are muddled and the editorial notes get mixed up in the play-text proper. Very disappointed that Pelican would do this -- I imagine they simply wanted an easy way onto the ebook market and didn't think about the mechanics of what they were doing at all. If you need electronic Shakespeare, get it somewhere else."
3,Typographical Errors Abound,"The content of this book is vital to our understanding of the trial by jury, both broadening and ennobling the contemporary role of juror.The book itself, however, is saturated with typographical errors. It looks as if the publisher scanned an old copy of the book into a program that 'reads' documents, and neglected to proofread it before sending it to press. This is incredibly disappointing given the importance of the topic and the meticulous care Spooner devotes to it.I'm sorry I can't recommend a better edition of this book. All I can say is that I will not buy anything from this publisher in the future."
3,If only Ustinov had read this...,"Ah, if only, indeed. Sessions approaches this reading as if it were the first time he had seen the material. Any grasp of Ustinov's fabulously wry novel would have led him to understand that god should be, like Ustinov himself, quietly powerful. His rendering of Mr. Smith is, however, appropriately sniveling."
5,Great Biography,"I'm usually not a fan of non-fiction, especially biographies, but this was great! It was so interesting to dive into Anne Hutchinson's life and learn about the way she impacted American History. The authors did an excellent job of making her story gripping to the point that it didn't feel like a typical biography. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes biographies or needs to read one for an assignment."
3,False title,"This book follows the story of a woman who opposed the puritanical laws of the early Americans. Yet the title is totally misleading. Jezebel lived in the time of Elijah and she was a killer of prophets, a religious fanatic who tried to whipe out one religion to replace it with another. This book is about someone who resisted an orthodox faith, and the heroin of this book is no Jezebel.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,bookclub,The book provide an insight to simple decorating and not the overstylish and clutter look that some decor have. It met my expectation and even offer more on the minimalist to clean type of living with what we have and how we can maximize the use of our existing furniture to its potential.
1,Was Not Pleased!,"This Product Not Only Arrived In An Opened Package,And Without The String (Which All Balloons Include)But It Didn't Come With The Taffy That's Supposedly Included.OverAll I Gave This Product 1 Star,And That's Being Generous Because If i Could I Wouldn't Even Give That!"
4,Mini music box,"Loved the music box, and it was in fine condition - but the shipping wasn't good. It took a long while, and the box the music box came in was smashed and unusable. It was shipped in a puffy envelope, not a shipping box- horribly poor shipping in my opinion. But the item itself- discounting the shipping- was fine.They need to ship in the future in a box with good packing materials, not mail it in an envelope!"
2,Gold Miniature Music Box - Skaters,"I liked this the least of the series. Generally, I think these little music boxes and most charming and whimsical."
1,Sadly disappointed,This product was so cheap looking! It wasn't worth a dime. I am very disappointed!
2,Do not buy Kindle version!,"Do not buy the digital Kindle version! The Kindle version is not complete, it does not include all the cases that are in the actual paperback book. It is missing several important cases and information that you will need if you're using it in a college course. There was no information regarding this when I purchased it so now I will be forced to buy the hardcopy."
1,Complete fail,"I paid 80$ for a brand new book and extra for expedite shipping. What I ended up getting was a clearly marked used book in big black writing on the bottom of it, yet the receipt that came with still shows that I purchased a ""new"" book. Very dissatisfied to say the least"
4,Great read for family business owners/members,"Will teach you a lot about the conflicts that come about in a family business, and how to effectively deal with them. More geared towards large wealthy familys (think Johnson and Johnson family) but has a lot of valuable concepts/ideas that can be used by smaller mom and pop shops."
5,Perfect item,"I bought this book, and it is used.Conditions are more than perfect!Content is really interesting and useful for the course."
5,The Shattered Pearl by Sara Armstrong,"This book is a well written personal experience of living through the most terrifying takeover by a dictator with no conscience orinteligence. I cringed at the Fear generated by people suddenly missing and not heard from again.The stupidity of taking over the shops and businesses causing shortages of everything needed to keep the people fed, clothed and in good health.I got a strong feeling from it that it is not that hard to pull off in a civilization that took freedom for granted much like we do here in the United States. Freedom demands eternal vigilance and this book points this out with great force.The last election in my town brought out little more than 20% of the Vote. That must change or we may emulate the citizens of this great book by Sara Armstong."
3,An adequate performance,"This LaserDisc release of Highlights from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker is a low-priced recording, if you can find it. It is enjoyable if all you want is a performance of Nutcracker for you Christmas Music library. As it is an abridged version (more than just the op 71a suite but less than the entire ballet score) and is adequately performed. It starts with the march of the children, and contains a number of good highlights from the full ballet. Recommend it? As I stated before, yes if all you want is highlights for your Christmas music library, but not recommended if you want the complete ballet."
3,Nutcracker,"I had this CD but lost it, so I needed a replacement.It is a good selection of the music from ""The Nutcracker"".The only problem that I have is with the divertissement section where all the songs run together instead of being listed singly."
5,A must for any Renaissance lover,"This is a marvelous showcase of classical music and classical rock's finest voice. If, like me, you missed this in its earlier release, don't make the same mistake again."
2,"Nice voice, bad tunes","Love her voice. She was a singer for Renaisance that did unusual rock like albums, but this is all classical music, kinda boring."
5,Amazing,"The GG books are the greatest books written. Between Blair and her jelousy and Serena with her flings there was just so much action. It was non stop amazment and I think it only fit that every teenage girl experiance the GG phenomenon, it's worth the time spent in your room to read these amazing books!"
4,It's actually pretty good!,"Ok...This book wasn't like OMG I love it, but it was a really good book for teenagers. It has plenty of characters that you can get a feel for. It's a great book once you really get into it. You're kind of always wondering what's going to happen next."
5,The best books ever!!,"If u havn't read this you're really missing out, b/c this is one of the best series i've ever come across. It deals w/typical stores about teens but it tells it in a more rich, funny, fantastic, u wish u were them way! a must buy."
5,living it up,"this is a must for all fans of melodic hard rock.the best songs on this cd are:children of tomorrow and summernights-fantastic power ballads,andcome on-great up tempo AOR stuff."
4,"Good, concise introduction for undergrads","This is an excellent introduction to Economic History for undergraduate students. It is concise and well-written, full of poignant examples, tracing economic organization from the Middle Ages through the present. The chapter summaries and discussion questions at the end of each chapter are very useful for both the student and the professor. The brevity of the book leaves open the possibility of including related academic articles or even other textbooks in the syllabus.The main disappointment is that the nineteenth century--which was full of economic, social, and political change--is basically ignored. The content jumps from the Industrial Revolution to the beginning of the twentieth century. The traditional Euro-American egocentrism is also present."
2,I'm sure there are better books elsewhere,"The book provided a fairly decent foundation for the concepts it presents, though I feel as though it does so in an overly wordy and diffuse manner. The authors frequently make sweeping statements about a general topic with little to no evidence; indeed, little to no evidence even exists for some of the generalizations made. Similarly, the authors frequently pose what appears to be a significant question at the beginning of a section and then do little to answer it, instead jumping from topic to topic as if to say ""look how much stuff we know!"" I know I have a bias in coming from the physical sciences, but I believe students and instructors can find a clearer and more concise overview of the material in another book."
3,boring for those who dont study this suject normaly,the book is a uninteresting read for those who dont study this subject but it is also a good beginners book for those who will study the subject...
4,I can hear you loud and clear,very clear voice and the ability to mute and turn the volume up or down is a plus. The set is very easy just plug the rj45 cat 5 into your wall module.
4,Interesting memoir,Interesting memoir that provides little insight into the lives of the book's title stars but reveals loads about the mindset of a starstruck woman. Ms. Leigh was a beautiful model with obvious talent but her lack of priorities and conscience was never fully explained and frankly left me baffled. Worse she dedicated the book to her son even though she chose to spend her time with married or disengaged men over being a mother to him during his childhood.
3,whos this lady????,"i think like a lot of people she wrote the book to cash in on elvis, simple as that. she was just another notch on elvis""s bedpost, nothing more, nothing less. Has anyone in the uk ever heard of this woman other than the fact she bedded elvis? at the same time bedding another two blokes as well and she thinks thats cool!aint this woman ever heard of std""s? what a tart"
5,Thriller for grown-ups,"I saw this movie on TV many years ago and fell in love with it. It stood out from the many ""routine"" thrillers you could watch every week in one form or another.Here you had real quality! Kate Capshaw was excellent as the ""retired"" CIA agent, forced to go on one more mission out of gratitude to a colleague, who once saved her life.Well, you get thrilling chases, lots of humorous sitiuations, getting to feel the icy fear of not being able to trust even those sent you on this dangerous mission; ending up facing lethal danger, only having yourself to rely on. There is also good support from her co-stars. Picture- and sound quality is fine on this DVD release.Bravo Kate and CO!"
1,Tin can opera,"What in the world?Perhaps somebody from DELTA got the bright idea of using a cellphone to secretly capture these ""live"" operatic excerpts-- and not from the orchestra seats, either-- this guy had to be way up in the last row of the third balcony.Luciano Pavarotti only recorded in the ""hi-fi"" music era, yet these cuts almost sound as tinny as Enrico Caruso acoustic cylinders. The only thing missing here is the surface noise-- come to think of it, that might have been an improvement.When it comes to PAVAROTTI * LIVE ON STAGE, the fat lady sang long before the fat man ever did! A real stinker."
2,Not One of Her Best,"I have read many books by Debbie Macomber, and this one was the least interesting. It really seemed to drag, had fewer characters and story lines than the other books. Nell and Travis, the two main characters of this book are not quite as interesting as the other match ups that usually populate her novels. The mystery of Bitter End does get solved, but that part of the story was really slow. Also, I felt that the minor characters like Nell's two children and her mother-in-law were not very well drawn.I know that Debbie Macomber fans are very loyal, so I am sorry if this offends some of you, but maybe I have read too many of her books with the same plot."
1,"Nell's Cowboy (Heart of Texas, No 5)",this book has not been received yet ---- we ordered 4 books and 3 came in OK --Nell's Cowboy has not been received----could you help with this?Nick Capozio
4,Nell's Cowboy by Debbie Macomber (Large Print Mills & Boon Hardcover),"Fifth book in the Heart of Texas series (also known as Sons of Promise): Lonesome Cowboy, Texas Two-Step, Caroline's Child, Dr. Texas, Nell's Cowboy, and Lone Star Baby. Nell's Cowboy is the book in the series in which the mystery of the ghost town of Bitter End is finally solved.Description from the book back cover:Nell Bishop, widowed mother of two, is turning Twin Canyons into a dude ranch. Her first guest is Travis Grant, an Easterner known for his children's books. Nell's kids are crazy about him, and Nell could fall for him herself. But it's too soon to be thinking of love and marriage again. Not only that, Travis seems intent on stirring up the town - uncovering the mystery in its past.SONS OF PROMISE: They're rugged, proud and just a little sassy! They'll make you laugh and they'll make you cry. Meet them all in Promise, Texas."
2,An acceptable continuation,"The 5th story in the Sons of Texas series seems to be the pivotal book in the continuing Bitter End Saga. The mystery of Bitter End is finally solved.... if you've read the other four books, you definitely want to know this, but the story of Nell and Travis seems to be lost in the process. If you haven't read the other Sons of Texas books, don't read this one first!!!!"
5,A wonderful example of thinking outside of the box!!,"I enjoyed this book as a small child. I read it to my younger siblings in the sixties, my students in the seventies, and my son in the eighties. I still have my original copy and would recommend it to children of all ages. Elmer Elevator is a loyal young lad who shows great initiative and courage."
5,Remember when?,"I have fond memories of this book as a child and was so happy to see it again-- I bought this as a gift, after I downloaded it on my Kindle; it's a lovely children's classic!"
4,A Sweet Tale,"Let's just keep it simple. My dad read this to me when I was six. At the age of 18 I still remember the book, author, and plot line and I plan on reading it to my kids. My Father's Dragon is a childhood classic that just doesn't get old."
5,*****,"I read this book about 5 years ago, in first grade. My teacher had it on the book rack and I read it (along with most of the other ones). I can't remember most of the plot, characters, or anything else, all I remember is that I LOVED it. I'm going to try to read it again someday. Although this book is said to be for 9-12 year olds, I would definately say it's for 8 and under kids, maybe nine at a stretch (average books for my age group I read three years ago). If you're trying to get your kid to read, buy them this book. Nice and easy, but with enough action to satisfy any imagination."
1,Cheap copy with no illustrations,Whatever the reviews for this book buyers should beware that this edition doesn't include any illustrations. It is simply a cheap reprint of the original in plain typeface with no illustrations. Simple placeholders titled '[Illustration]' appear throughout the copy. Overall it looks like a stage play manuscript printed on 8.5x11 with a glossy cover. The low price of this item is definitely a reflection on the quality!
3,MyFather's Dragon,"I reccomend this book for ages 8 and undr, because if your over the age of eight it will be to easy. I still think that it's a funny book, but you'll never learn anything if you read it. My Father's Dragon is about a boy who goes to an island and tries to save a dragon. So I give My Father's Dragon two thumbs up, because it's hilarious."
5,Great book,I bought this book to read with my 7 year old. He loved it. The chapters were short enough to read one a night and still keep his attention.
5,Great Introduction for First Novel,I read this to my 4 and 6 year olds and they loved it. Captured their imagination and with just enough pictures to assist while still introducing them to a good story without a drawing.
3,Buy a better quality print of this book,"While the story is definetly worth 5 stars, all the paperback printings of this story render the art absolutely hiddeous. The fine graphite shading of the illustrations is totally lost and the images end up looking like Xeroxes from a newspaper. I grew up reading this story in an anthology of stories published in the 1950's; the art in the anthology is of the highest quality so I know most reprints of this story today are sadly lacking - and it's a shame, too, because I know how much I enjoyed looking at the pictures as a child with my grandfather reading the story to me. These newer printings leave much to be desired."
1,I'm still waiting...,"I bought two of these with enough time for our annual family camp out. Unfortunately, that event came and went, and I'm still waiting for them to arrive."
3,How to actually solve it please,"I want to like this book. But please tell me where is anything actually solved? Browsing through the book to decide if I should work my way through it or not, it looks for all the world like a nearly endless list of problem ""set-ups"".Here is a convex problem,... here is another,.... here is a variation, here is the set up for an application, ... here is a quasiconvex problem set up,.. etc. etc.OK, but please, solve a few optimization problems all the way to the end in whatever sense appropriate to the subject.Tell me on what page I can find a ""solution"" (and I don't mean a closed formula necessarily)."
5,it is good,"anyway, it is good. It is a classic book in communication and signal processing area. The book is quite new."
1,ONE WORD: SKIMPY!!!,"Save your money and consult the free online edition, if you must.I needed this book for a class, but if you have the option, look for a better and more complete book. This one is definitely not worth the money. It leaves out a lot of important details and is utterly useless if you're trying to learn the material on your own. There are no solved exercises either."
5,A definite guide,"The book excels in readability and style. A perfect balance on the theoretical and practical aspets of the convex optimization. As the name implies, and also as the authors put in preface, it is about recognizing, formulating, and solving convex optimization problems. Provides necessary mathematical background in the first part---not as deeply as a gradute level convex analysis book---and therefore helps reader build a working knowledge. If something is not covered in this part but essential for a working knowledge, then it is in the appendices for sure. Provides a wealth of examples, exercises, and applications. Perfect for self-study as well as classroom use."
5,BWAHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!,Ok this was probably the best season of the three seasons that I've bought (I'll get the 4th soon). With the World Wide Recorder concert episode definitely taking the award for best ever. A must buy for anyone remotely interested in South Park.
3,rock on south park,this season was aiight but da 1st one really kicked a** buy ssn.1ssn.2 and the movie 4 starters and if u like it get de others but anything after ssn.5 sux
1,No quality control,The company that produced this item must have no quality control dept. I purchased this item as a gift and Disk #2 was missing from this set and I gave it as a gift and I was very embarrassed when the item was opened on Christmas eve. I know of 2 other people that had the same problem !
5,Great season!,"I love South Park and this is one of my favorite seasons, because of the succubus episode (actually turns out to be a foreshadowing of events to come for Chef). There are plenty of other hysterical moments and I do recommend including it in your South Park collection."
4,hilarious,This is a nicely done set of some of the best South Park episodes ever done. This was when South Park was really edgy and funny and is among the best the series has to offer. The price is right too.
5,South park,"This season has the best episodes, my favorite was hooked on monkey phonics, and rainforest shmainforest, they were very cute and funny episodes, Kyle sing very good too.. and chinpokomon was an awesome episode I love cartman's little whine.."
5,"""No Cake for the Imperator!""","I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. When you have Moses as the thing from Tron, you just can't possibly go wrong. The Chinpokomon, Meteor Shower Trilogy and the Brown Noise episodes are all classics, and Matt and Trey's ""Commentary Mini"" are absolutely classic."
3,every episode hilarious?,"i loved season 2 and was sorely disappointed with all of the first five episodes of season 3. i hardly laughed throughout any of them, and they seemed to just lazily recycle some of the stuff in season 2. the rainforest episode's final rundown of facts about casualties the rainforest has caused redeems it somewhat, but the rest just makes no sense. jennifer aniston's teacher character is supposed to be for the rainforest but this makes the name of her group and the song lyrics pointless and unfunny. however after sexual harassment panda, which was funny, they seem to regain their footing, with the episode with cartman and stan's sister being absolutely brilliant. i think when cartman isn't funny, south park isn't funny. his repeated ""mostly...mostly"" line is as hilarious as his lines in ""club houses"", another classic cartman episode."
3,Solid Stuff,I have a problem with Elton Dean on this one... he seems disconnected from the rest of the band. He ends up leaving the band by the end of the month too. He wasnt the most consistant player either. Missing his parts on various tracks and such. Anyway... this is a mono recording but it's moot because the sound quality is most excellent. The performances are a little uninspired at times but overall a great document for this period. A bit of a rare recording I say so worth buy for Softs fans. I am a fan of the Wyatt era and this is a transition period to better stuff. In my opinion the next incarnation of the band made for more energy with Karl Jenkins. OH! Yah... sort of a sin to say from a Wyatt era fan.
3,Soft Machine - 'Live In France' (One Way) 2-CD,"I've never quite understood what the 'big yahoo' about Soft Machine is all about.The only CD reissues of theirs that I like is 'Jet Propelled Photographs'(see my review),'Fourth' and maybe their 'Fifth' effort.With a total of twelve songs clocking in at one-hour-and-forty-five minutes,Soft Machine proves to their fans that they're fully capable of playing their own style of 'Canterbury Jazz Rock'.Actually,more jazz than anything else.Line-up here is:Elton Dean-sax&piano,Hugh Hopper-bass,John Marshall-drums and Mike Ratledge-electric piano&organ.Should appeal to fans of National Health,Caravan and Tortoise."
3,Philosophy more than science,"We have here a quite extensive review of the domain : 538 pages in small font. Such a work fits well in the publications of MIT Press, presently the most productive publisher about digital media.This collection of lectures targets more the literary and philosophical minds than the technical, hands on, geeks. Nevertheless, some chapters don't fear to deal with rather formal issues, for instance the lecture of Bruno Latour and Geneviève Tell, who dare to exhibit a mathematical formula in such a context.As an art critic, we appreciate the contribution of Stephen Wilson ""Artificial Intelligence Research as Art"", which includes several pictures of his works, on the borders of art and science.Pierre BergerArt Criticdiccan.com diccan.net"
5,Still amazed at this recording,"Singing, as recorded here, just does not exist like this anymore. The New York based opera singers of the 40s and 50s are as good as it gets for me and Tucker and Steber, both in their primes in 1949, are among my favorite singers. Sony did a fantastic job with the remastering. I wish they'd remaster more recordings with great singers of the past instead of signing ones like Paul Potts. Time to get back on the right track Sony!"
4,"Great doggie door, medium size is pefect for Chihuahua and Dachshunds.","This little doggie door is the best. With the metal frame construction and ease of installation, this product is a sure win. It was the best size for my old Mini Dachshund and Chihuahua. Just make sure you have a plung circular saw or a jig saw to cut through the door. The only reason that I didn't give this product 5 stars is that it comes with plastic screws to mount the door, and well lets just say they don't hold up to the installation very well. A small trip to your local hardware store, and the same bolt in metal worked out better. The plastic ones do work well, but if you happen to strip one like I did, there is help at the local hardware store for a $0.99."
3,Good product hard to instalL,"Hard to install, almost cut myself on the metal stripping and the screws are on the outside entrance. Not the best door but looks pretty good"
1,Stay away from this tape.,The video and audio quality was so poor that I didn't get past the first 5 minutes of this tape. Stay away from it and save 10 bucks.
5,Raw British Blues,"I always tend to compare anything the Groundhogs do to their Who Will Save The World album and for this early release, the similarities are very vague. This is pure blues. There are a few odd timings here and there to add unique twists to the usual 12 bar structure and for the first time ever, I heard a different vocalist on a Groundhogs song in Steve Rye on two of the cuts. Over the years, Tony McPhee has not strayed too far from his roots despite stretching into more progressive music. I see this is the first in a progression from pure blues to rocking blues to rock and then back to blues again in later releases.I really like this album. I've always had a fondness for the old white blues players like John Mayall and Canned Heat. This is right there with them. Tony's voice is unique, there is nobody else out there like him, and that is a big plus.If you are looking for the roots of British Blues, this is a great start. Highly recommended."
1,Really Really Bad Quality,This comes in several little pieces and the quality was absolutely horrible - cheapest thinnest material that looked and felt poor. Huge disappointment - we never even wore it. Pieces were lost immediately.
1,do not buy this!!!,"I bought this little red riding hood costume from Costume Craze going by the sizing chart they gave. When I got the costume, it was too small for my daughter. I contacted the company to exchange the item because they misinformed me about its actual size, and they refused to pay the shipping and handling to return the item. I will never buy from Costume Craze again!!!"
3,price is right,"There are many things that are wrong than right with this costume. However, for what I paid ($11.30) for something that my daughter will only use a few hours, I am giving it 3 stars for ""good enough"".1. My daughter wears size 10 clothes so I ordered this costume size L based on other reviews that it's too short. The blouse is big as expected but the skirt is mid-thigh high, meaning WAY SHORT!2. Skirt is not flowing as pictured. Rather, it's clingy because it's polyester3. Belt is felt-like. The string on the belt is white and printed (not real string)4. Cape is super thin and a different color red than belt and skirt. It's way small compared to the large blouse and is choking when fastened (by 2 pieces of little black velcros)I will need to make few adjustments. I would recommend this costume ONLY if it's $11.30 max."
2,Material is cheap,"I bought this costume for my daughter, and I realized very soon that it was a huge mistake. The material is very cheap, and she couldn't wear it twice. However, for the price you pay, it's worth a shot as a disposable costume."
1,Don't waste your time,"I ordered this, thinking I could improve upon it to make it a little better. Not worth it. I ended up using an entirely different costume. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE IMAGE!! Don't waste your money or time on this"
4,Delivery problem,"The cans of formula were convenient, and my baby had no problems with switching from the powder to this version of ready-to-feed. However, beware of the shipping - unfortunately, it was not packed well, and we had many dented cans."
1,Bad customer experience...Need help!!!,"I ordered 3 boxes of these, and 2 of them came smashed (they are made of glass). Who can I call to get 2 new boxes sent? I've tried sending emails, but get no help!!!"
5,Oistrakh plays Shostakovich Violinconcerto nr.1 (1956),It is a wonderful and historic recording in perfect quality - mono but that doesn't matter.
5,"historic, impressive","The Oistrakh performance of the violin concerto is in mono but is tolerable. Although he certainly overplays in some other contexts (I'm thinking of his Bach violin concerto interpretations), Oistrakh gives a satisfying rendition of Shostakovich in this historic recording. But it is the Rostropovich that shines. Though in stereo, the sonics here, too, are dated. Rostropovich's cello practically leaps through the recording to grab you by the throat. New territory, new music, new mind. You can hear it in his playing. Good price, too."
2,Should have been SO MUCH BETTER!!!,"How can you miss with a book about lesbian vampires?!!! This should EASILY have been both scary and intensely erotic --- but it was NEITHER!!! Problem #1: Too many P.C. authors, trying to make their lesbian vampires champions of the political plight of lesbian women --- BORING!!! Problem #2: Very poor mixing of terror and sensuality, which like terror and humor can very often mix together very well! Problem #3: Isn't the whole vampire thing usually portrayed as an older evil guy rapaciously pursuing innocent, virginal young women? So what's so hard about replacing the older guy with a beautiful slightly older woman, having her seducing pretty young women with or without their consent? No, this book was a failure because Ms. Kesey tried to go the politically correct route, and the result is a disappointing, very un-erotic collection of so-so stories."
2,Boring,"There was not enough action, not enough sex,and the vampire characters SUCKED big time.. Horrible read I would not recommend anyone let alone lesbians read this story.. Unless you like old English and vampires."
3,Average,I have to say I neither liked or disliked this book. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.
4,So much more,"I have yet to finish reading this book but I'm very happy with what I have read so far.I was surprised with the detail given on the legand of vampires and the very origin of them, great reading."
3,Follow the Sun,"It has been many years since watching Follow the Sun. This is a motivational movie for any young golfer to watch. It is about faith and persistance.As a young man this picture had a major influence on my life. When it is available for sale again, I will be the first to buy a copy."
1,Worst movie ever!,"First of all, I'd like to thank the people who gave this movie a high rating. I'd just like to know what you were smoking when you watched it.This is the corniest piece of garbage I have ever seen. It should be listed as a comedy, not a horror flick.PLEASE don't waste your money on this trash.Being an ALL MY CHILDREN fan, I was interested in watching it to see Alexa Havins. I'll bet she regrets this huge *boo boo.*"
1,I Want My Money Back!!!!!!,"I just finished watching this movie having rented it yesterday. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but......... WHAT A TERRIBLE, STUPID, CHEAP, BORING MOVIE!!!!! Terrible acting. Yes, there was some blood but that does not make this movie any better for me. Crazy plot, and it looks like someone took an ordinary cheap camcorder and shot this movie. I suffered through it only because I spent $4.29 to rent it and that was $4.29 too much!!! What a waste of time and money. I could not wait until this movie was over with. Please, don't waste your time and money like I did on this horrible attempt at a horror movie. It's terrible!!"
5,delightfully disturbing,"This movie leaves you with the eerie sense that nothing's right with the world. The story concept is one of the most twisted I have seen and I doubt I will be able to get it out of my mind for a long time. If you want to get a real scare, check this movie out. It will mess with your mind."
5,Great little book on the history of England,"As my title says, it's a great little book on the history of England. My copy just feel out of the back of my over stuffed desk drawer and without creating a huge mess can't get to it now, as I was going to give a little info on pages ect... But I wasn't disappointed in it when I got it. I definately learned a lot I didn't previously know about."
4,Scotland's greatest defeat told clearly,"This book proves to be a highly readable book that clearly explains the political, military and personalities situation behind this battle.It explains why in 1513 when Scotland held all the cards in their favor, they suffered one of their greatest defeat in their national history. The book clearly explained how Scotland adapted the highly touted Swiss military system without understanding why it was so highly regarded. So while on paper, the Scots held all the advantages, there were many weaknesses within that army that led to its destruction.One of the better books written about this battle which not much have been written about. I almost expected to see Osprey comes out with a title from their campaign series but I was glad to read this book which proves to be so well written. Easy enough for casual readers and good enough for serious student."
5,For fans of great music and great hair,"This video proves that The Banshees made great videos as well as great music. The band took as many influences from film as they did from other music and literature and so were involved in every part of the video-making process-and it shows. From Fireworks (of which the shoot had to be cut short as the guy in charge of pyrotechnics accidentally set a flare off in his own face) thro' Slowdive (love those false eyelashes guys!), Last Beat of my Heart (one take!!!) to the classic Peek-a-Boo (greatest video ever made anyone?) every one's a masterpiece. Of course this video should also be made essential viewing to anyone learning the rudiments of hairdressing with Ms.Sioux never looking anything less than stunning. Hairspray manufacturers must have blessed their lucky stars..."
5,Great Moments,"I liked all these videos because they take me to diferent periods of time in the life of the band. All videos are acomodated sequencially in time so you just enjoy it from the beginning to the end. They let us see the beautiful Siouxie through the ages and the rest of the group. Of course, all songs are hits! ... and as it was my case I had never seen them ""alive"" so buying this video was the only chance I had."
2,"easy to play, awful to sing","While these songs are relatively easy to play for beginning guitarists, I bought the book so I could play and sing with my young son. Except for a couple of the songs, I found the key the songs were written in made them very hard to sing."
3,Frontrunner,"Primary Colors is a modern tragedy. And that's a compliment. Okay, it's not exactly Death of a Salesman, but it does chronicle the rise and fall of an idealist. You could never accuse presidential hopeful Jack Stanton (John Travolta) of being a dime a dozen, but let's just say we've seen his kind before.Primary Colors is director Mike Nichols best film in years. He has something say again. Finally. And he and writer Elaine May mold their seething satire into something admirably meaningful. It's a real killer, in fact. The laughter comes while you wince at the moral corruption and game playing. But forget all the comparisons to our own first family (although Travolta's dead-on impersonation makes it difficult); instead pay attention to Henry (the young political aide). The decay he witnesses as part of the greatest political campaign of the 20th century takes its toll. The bright eyes and bushy tail can't survive. His innocence is lost; a country is gained."
4,Need help!,"Really liked the movie. Very good acting. Especially interesting at this time, considering our long wait for election results. Getting ready to read the book. Please someone, write and tell who you think the various characters in this movie represent in the campaign of '92."
5,Nichols is in primary condition,"Something you would expect from the same guy who directed the legendary film The Graduate. Primary Colors is my second favorite movie from Nichols. It is such a one-of-a-kind movie with its plot taken from a Bill and Hillary Clinton-esque view. Combining one hell of a plot with a very humorous cast, Nichols scores again with another nice flick."
4,"Emotionally Satyristic Movie, Very Good.","My wife and I, really enjoyed the DVD version. John Travolta (excellent actor) has the demeanor of an ""antisocial"" and very good politician. The character of the campaign director is the ""Super-Ego"" of the family. Emma Thompson is a very hard woman, strong and confident. I loved the intervention of Maura Tierney, she is a very supportive woman in this movie as well as in ""Liar Liar"". I believe that women like her are very hard to find. The movie has more expressed emotions than the average movie. Not recommended for children under 17 years, nor over 74 years."
3,Travolta,Quite a political drama. The acting is good and the story like is also. Kathy Bates is simply wonderful in this movie.
4,Good for Adrian and Bates,"Other than Adrian Lester (obviously a passionate and dedicated actor) and Kathy Bates (anything she is in is better because of her participation), the acting was mediocre and the story did not interest me in the least. Travolta played a scumbag, through and through. But the characters played by Adrian & Kathy were very interesting to me."
3,"fairly good political film, but it cld have been MUCH better","Travolta isn't quite Bill Clinton, but he makes a fairly convincing populist politician who is running a very rough campaign. However, the acting by most of the others is not that great. Even Emma Thompson seems fairly wooden in her performace. But Thornton and the young black actor (Lester?) are really pretty bad. Also, I just didn't get a feeling of fascination at the process - in fact, it barely held my attention, unlike Redford's wonderful The Candidate. I didn't get the feeling that I was learning anything or indications of things that I would want to learn: the whole thing seemed kind of boring and lurid.Tepidly recommended."
2,Incessant profanity was a real turn off,"The acting and story line were fine but the incessant and unnecessary profanity marred my enjoyment of this film. Is it really necessary to have characters swearing constantly in films? I now know why I can not go to a mall or down a street without hearing the ""F"" word everyday. If hollywood stars spew such trash I can understand why impressionable young people believe it is ok to use such trashy language in everyday speech. The actors in this film were portraying supposedly educated persons who want to govern the citizens of the United States but they talk like uneducated bums! Hollywood, clean up your act!!!"
1,"Interesting movie, but too politically motivated.",I'm sorry for giving this movie just one star I think that in terms of acting it deserves at least three. But what totally turns me off by this movie(as well as other Hollywood flicks with a subliminal motive) is how the character(who is undoubtedly a resemblence of Clinton) is laughded(albeit ever so slightly)as a hero. THIS GUY(portrayed by Travolta)IS A SICK SCUMBAG WHO DESEVES TO BE TARRED AND FEATHERED AND RUN OUT OF POLITICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.The character mportrayed in the movie is a sick person who cares more about himself and his polirtical career than anyone else including the people who voted for him. He is a miserable example of a human being and should be portrayed as such.
2,If you like,"Bill Clinton - you'll like the story of his presidential campaign, with all the very intimate details."
4,Dvd Primary Colors,"I had forgotten how much bad language was in the movie. Not your fault, I should have researched it more."
5,Primary Colors - Election Year Movie streamed to Kindle Fire,"I remembered this movie as being a unique look inside a campaign and decided to watch it again. It is sometimes comedy and sometimes drama and flows very smoothly with no lag spots. It was supposed to be a spoof of Predisent Clinton and his womanizing ways - or perhaps all presidential candidates who have women on the side and the impact on their campaign. A great cast, a great story. I enjoyed the ability to see it again on my Kindle Fire - like having my own little movie house. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story."
4,Virginia Band gets better and better...,"Perhaps I'm a little biased (being a fellow Northern Virginian and George Mason Univ. alum), but ""Big Night..."" is another exceptional showcase by emmet swimming. I absolutely adore ""Turnstile"" (does this song remind anyone of their own life-come on!) and ""Motorway"", and the last track ""Sunblock"" was the perfect pre-vacation song. Get to know emmet swimming's ""Big Night..."" and previous two releases-you WILL NOT be disappointed."
4,i want you,"the only problem i have with this dvd is that it would only play on a region free dvd player, in other words it was a great movie. thank you"
2,Go with the brand name,"The leather was too wide for the holes in my glove (Rawlings) and was very stiff. I originally bought it because it could be shipped with Amazon Prime, but ended up buying the Rawlings product after concluding that this one wasn't usable."
2,Glove repair kit,"The glove repair kit had a couple of problems. First, the leather strip is larger than on the original glove. Second, and really irritating, the metal tool comes out of the wooden handle. I had to glue the metal rod into the handle and wait a day until it dried."
1,bad experience,"had a bad experience getting the product from box wave. I had been looking forward to receiving the product, but am really dissappointed with the product. Is very poorly built and also very heavy. The usb port is placed or manufactured incorrectly so you have to tilt and push the charging cable in. The space bar does not press (click) as the other keys, which is also poorly built. I am also experiencing sync issues. If you press a key once sometimes it stays pressed and you get multiple letters of the same key which could be a fault in the key or sync issue. Over all, its a waste of money"
1,No customer service,"I had this product for two weeks and starting having problems. Blinking yellow LED, solid green LED during charging, but it would not hold a charge. Finally a solid blue LED before its death. LED operation was not described in operator's manual, so I had no idea how to troubleshoot this problem. I sent 3 E-Mails to Boxwave customer service, and have not received any response. I got their phone number (425) 828-6641 from the BBB, but their voice mailbox is full. Really? Who sells a defective product and completely ignores its customers? Boxwave will probably be out of business in a year, because customers don't tolerate this type of service. Stay away from Boxwave!"
1,Does'nt work,"I used it for hardly Two days and then it stopped working...i live in india so no easy replacements for me... I wud say a really unreliable product , a total waste of money... Really depressed each time i look at it.... Dont buy dis product... There e far better options available in the market and much cheaper also.... Its one of the costliest keyboard around and dis is what da result is..."
4,Keypad's Rule,"I prefer keypads over touch screen keys. Overall this is a good product. When you slide the keyboard out you have to touch a key to wake up the device. I would prefer the keyboard woke up/functioned right away by sliding it out, that way you would save time and the hassle of waking it up first."
3,Satisfactory,A little too heavy but works fine. Biggest problem is that it doesn't sink up with auto correct so less useful.
3,Management Innovators- Amazon Recommended-Just Okay,"Selection of the people and ideas that have shaped business marginal. Author selects high profile individuals (for the most part) and borrows liberally from existing commentary on those folks. In my opinion should have included more technical people (engineers) who often labor in the shadows and are, of course, more difficult to identify. They work hard to create what does not exist (as opposed to scientists who work hard to explain what does exist)! The book ""Beyond the Hype-The Essence of Good Management"" by Eccles and Nohria a much better choice for folks interested in successful management."
5,AWESOME,"BETTER THAN THE PIX. MY FAV EARRINGS........WELL MADE, AND I RECEIVED THEM QUICKLY....THANKS"
2,artwork disappointing,"I loved Sojourn 1 -- a great story line supported by Greg Land's incredible drawing. I bought book 2 of the series hoping for more of the same but was greatly disappointed in that the first and last chapters are drawn by different artists. The characters look so different that I spent the whole first chapter wondering if I'd somehow wandered into a different story. Was that blonde supposed to be Arwyn? Was that guy Gareth? Thankfully most of the book is drawn by Greg Land. I was on familiar territory again when I reached Chapter 2. The last chapter is a complete letdown because it too has a different artist, so again you feel that Arwyn and Gareth have disappeared and have been replaced by doubles -- and not very good ones at that. A very disappointing experience."
3,tweezer,This okay. Not to comfortable in using this item. But maybe as the eye sight gets worse it will work better
1,Not happy with this product!,"Product was delivered before the promised time, but about the quality of the product...I'm not very happy, the light is nice & bright, but it is very wide making the tweezing very stressful on the fingers!"
1,These things are useless!,These tweezers are a big joke. The light is not near bright enough and the tweezers don't pluck my eyebrows because they don't come together. I definetly wasted my money on this one! Do not buy this item!
1,LumaTweeze vs LumaTweeze Pro,"I ordered the LumaTweeze Pro this past week 12/29/09, They Shipped me the LumaTweeze, The LumaTweeze was not worth the price at all. I am very surprised they would advertise(Image Displayed) one thing and ship another. The LumaTweeze is not worth it at all."
1,Terrible Product,Seller did not send the tweezers illustrated. Sent bigger rounded bulkier model - impossible to use. Too costly to ship back. Don't waste your money on these. Try the La-Tweez Illuminated Tweezers instead. They work pretty good.
5,Life,Great live album here. Great mix of the new stuff with the classics. I definitely recommend picking it up. It easily holds up to Live & Dangerous.
4,Enjoying it on a computer speaker in an office environment.,"Played it at work.(Yes, with the door open.) Fun and lively, helps keep me awake. Playing right now, even as I type. Regimental march really hops. Hard to sit still. Compares well with my other LaserLight bagpipe and drum discs. (This is my fourth). They have again put together a smooth flowing easy-to-listen to selection. Have trouble leaving the office in the evening-can't seem to turn the thing off."
3,average for a piping CD,"First of all it's ""piobaireachd"" not ""Pio Braireachd"". Second it's ""The Conundrum"" not ""The Conund Rum"" I guess whoever transposed the titles for the CD sleave didn't understand this. The Cd is overall Okay but go get ""Royal Scots Dragoons -- Highland Cathedral"" or ""Simon Fraser University pipe band -- Live from Canage Hall"" if you really need to hear good piping music."
1,"Good songs, poor quality, not impressed",this cd had potential but the quality is so poor that the money spend on this cd should go to something else.
2,Good selection of tunes but CD has poor fidelity.,Many good tunes on the CD but the quality of the fidelity is poor. Track #4--the piobaireachd selection is stunning. There are better CDs out there with top notch clarity.
2,fair,if i could do it over again I would not get this book even thought i only paid .1 and 3.99 shipping it is a decent book to get from a libart but not to own
3,crystal clear sailing on a cyrstal ship,robbie krieger is one of the most underrated guitarists ever. close your eyes and listen to his cover of the doors' classic crystal ship and find yourself in another time and place. his tribute to the rolling stones' street fighting man is truly fine.
5,Stupendous,"I'm probably Karl Jenkins' largest fan, and he doesn't even know it. I find myself directing a faux choir/orchestra during his music. Yeah, I get weird looks on the plane, but I don't care!"
5,Wow,"This is really good, I'm an Adiemus fan, and at first I wasn't sure about this album, then I gave it a try...excellent. If you are an Adiemus fan I think you will LOVE this, even though Miriam is not on it, Pamela is on it still."
3,"A hit with Spongebob fans, but I wouldn't want to sleep on it!","The design is great, but like most children's sheet sets, it's scratchy. If you purchase it, use lots of fabric softener. The comforter that goes with it is okay, but pretty stiff. I knew it wasn't egyptian linen or anything like that...but WHY can't they make character sheets that are also comfortable for the kids?"
4,The quality of the grafics is perfect,"I like too mucho the images of Bob, the only thing that dislikeme a little it's not 100% cotton"
5,"Fascinating, multidisciplinary exploration of consciousness","This book presents notes from a summit of several top thinkers in the fields of psychoanalysis, neurophysiology, Buddhism, Western philosophy and others. Completely unlike a collection of essays; you're presented with the rich, dynamic and fascinating syntheses of the theories from each of these fields. The dialog format emphasizes the creativity and intelligence of participants. Worth reading no matter which philosphy you endorse -- all the better if you have some interest in each! This book has that rare quality of really making you work your brain muscle AND being a book you can't wait to come home to after work. Don't skip a page"
3,Drawing Out Some Potential Links between Science & Buddhism,"I found this book to be a little dry at times but nonetheless provides some useful explanations on the myths which have been with the human race since the ancient time: dream, sleep and death.From a buddhist perspective it helps reinforces the belief (at least not disproved it) of buddhist that there is a higher level of consciousness not yet been measured via any scientific means. From a scientific standpoint, the book has summarised the recent developments in neuroscience and showed us that there is a possibility one day both religion and science will meet face to face and one would have to change the fundamental concepts one used to hold. It could be the scientific community or the religious groups. At least HH the Dalai Lama is very open to the ideas in the book while the scientists were at times pretty ""close"" and reluctant to take a different perspective which made some of them sounded a little bit defensive."
4,Not as advertised,"Informative book. Lots if information about Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying but little that has to do with the Dalai Lama. These are the notes and observations from a conference on the subject of Sleeping, Dreaming, and Dying in which the Dalai Lama was present. He is a man of few words. This is really an East meets West discussion of the subject. I really learned more about Western thought than Buddhist thought. Still I did learn."
3,"Decent book, good stuff from the Dalai Lama",Several moderm day researchers spend a week with the Dalia Lama and discuss the topics of the books title. The material delivered from the Dalai Lama himself is the best part of this book.
3,"Midnight apocalypse movie, gotta love it","You may find this movie on TBS or similar channel at 3 in the morning. Underrated, not many people know about it...but it's fun, has zombie like creatures, and chicks with guns...what more can you ask for?"
4,night of valley girls,"Who doesn't love a movie that deals with the end of the earth or people for that matter. No more creepy people like the guy at the supermarket who stares at me everytime I buy beer. I gave this four stars b/c let's face it? The end of the world, two chicks, and no one gets naked. I mean what's up with that? They need to re-shoot this baby with a marketing strategy like Hooters. Such a classic. I think it's been remade like 9 times this year. Thumbs up for me."
3,All depends in what you want,"If you want a scarry movie then forget it, for starters is a zombie movie where are less than 10 in all the film. The plot is really weak and you never be sacared.The good thing...well, if you are fan of Catherine Mary Stewart or the 80`s you will enjoy."
4,Valley Girls with Submachine guns? Rock on!,"Catherine Mary Stewart, one of the 80s budget film queens, leads this film as a movie theater employee with a video game addiction, along with her Pep Squad little sister (Kelli Maroney), and a down-to-earth truck driver (Star Trek Voyager's Robert Beltran).If you're expecting Oscar material, you won't find it. What you will find is a fun, popcorn romp of a movie that covers zombies, the end of the world, shopping sprees, Mac submachine guns, and secret underground societies.I do agree with one of the other reviewers that the movie gets a bit weak at the end, but overall it's a fun experience, as long as you know what to expect.So sit back, crack open a can, grab the popcorn bucket, and let the movie begin!"
2,Just Plain Sucks ...,"1984PG13: Love scifi, but couldn't get through more than about an hour of this. The ole school, maybe 80's, soundtrack was the best part, and it wasn't great. MFJLabs 2x"
5,Daddy Would Have Gotten Us Uzis!,"For anyone that lived through the 80's, this movie is a fun flash-back to the good old days of primitive arcade games, feathered hair, and command line operating systems! Plus, it's a great cheesy B-movie sci-fi flick to boot. The opening scene where Sam rides the motorcycle through the deserted city seems completely ripped off by 28 Days. And, the three leads, Robert Beltran, Catherine Mary Stewart, and Kelli Maroney, are totally AWESOME! You should buy this DVD now-now-now!"
4,Back to the 80's,"Great movie and evoked a lot of memories from the 80's era. There is a lot of tension and not so much gore, which movies today seem to have overdone to cover up bad plots. So, OK the plot is a little unbelievable but it has a good story line and could be the precursor to the Will Smith recent zombie movie, I Am Legend. Definitely worth a first look if you haven't seen it yet or a re-look if it has been a while."
3,"""Night of the Comet""","The exciting return of a comet turns the citizens of Los Angeles, California from thrilled viewers into zombie like predators in search of normal survivors. The two valley girl sisters who among the survivors are soon joined by a truck driver survivor and then all three fight off would-be comet affected victims. Campy film fun."
3,Great 80's movie,"This is a typical 80's movie... not much plot but funny overall. The main girl was also in the Last Starfighter!! Otherwiae, this movie is a great time waster and would watch it on a monday night with nothing to do!"
3,"classic, get over it.","yes, they will probably remake it 1 day and yes, it will probably be better than the original, BUT-to this day, it remains a highly entertaining film that is a little scary, very funny and pure fun all the way until the end. good quality dvd mastering, too."
4,I like cheese!,"I love this eighties horror flick.A comet gets too close to Earth and disintegrates everyone. Okay, well almost everyone. People partially exposed were turned into zombies. Two teenage sisters, left as some of the very few survivors, make the apocalypse look fun: playing arcade games, acting as radio DJ, shooting fully automatic weapons, killing a few zombies, and free shopping sprees at the mall.The off-humor makes it even more cheesy, but I still love it."
3,"Delivers on cheesiness, not too zombified.","NOTC is the perfect example of eighties cheesy fun...but without the body count.Watch NOTC if you enjoy laughable dialogue and a movie with an adventurous, apocalyptic feel. The zombies are goofy and talk; they're more of a background note than on the forefront of the story.The film did seem rushed, nothing developed in-depth, but it's a good popcorn and soda movie. I'd say NOTC was a weird mix of ""Warning Sign"" and ""Slaughter High"" and Cyndy Lauper.Rent if you're a newcomer, own if you're a collection completist."
4,Night of the Comet,"I'm not a big fan of ""horror"" films but I love this 1980's cult film. Why and how did this film not make it to DVD when The Last Starfighter"" made it to DVD. This film is a fun friday night with a bowl of popcorn and some Chocolate kind of film. Please release it to DVD."
4,Forgotten 80's Zombie/Comedy/Apocalyptic Gem,"Used to watch this religiously as a wee lad in the decade of Reaganomics and jelly slippers.Thank you MGM for finally making this available to fans.Great film. Sparse DVD... but hey, if I can own 'Night of the Comet' in a digital format, I'm a happy movie buff.DMK will always rule the arcade! Believe it! Buy this now."
5,Bout friggin' time!!!!,"I was beyond excited when I got an email from Amazon this morning letting me know that this was being released on DVD. YES!!!!!! I have SO missed this movie! It's totally 80's cheese, but one of my fave 80's movies of all time. I can't wait!!!!"
4,DVD NOW!!!!!,"Just like everyone else that has reviewed this movie here, I am VERY Impatiently waiting for this to come out on DVD. I have two teenagers that I know would get a kick out of this. Let's get it on DVD already. If we have to take a Stephen Segal or Claude VanDork movie off the shelf to make room then do it already!! Thanks for your support."
3,Night of The Comet,"I remember seeing this as a kid,and All I can recall later on was the Semi Truck Peterbilt 359 Sleeper(barely in the movie)and empty streets in a downtown City setting,I could never remember the name and then saw it recently and it came back to me. The movie is bizarre and would fit many genres it is not a good movie per se but a Campy Cheesy flick that was part of the Genre of end of the world/Mad-Max-esque flicks coming out in the 80s."
2,Night of the Comet,The original one had a lot more action and suspence. Whole parts of the original have been taken out. It's sanitized down to pap. What a shame that all the things that made this movie one wild and exciting ride were deleted. First graders would find it boring and silly.
4,Finally! been waiting to long!,"Wow I didn't know that there finally realizing that we want these movies from the early 80's out on DVD! I saw this when I was 11-and I remember how weird the movie was -But still it was cool for a young preteen seeing something strange as that movie was-lol-.Now if they could only release on DVD RAD!..1986! ""Send me an angel""-Right now right now! Right now! lol-Sorry I got carried away--I know my history when it comes down to the 80's..Coming out on DVD on Feb 27th Amazon got this wrong--> Captain N And The Game Master: it was popular-in 1989 NEs ao remember the NES lol- I hope they start releasing more details for the Cartoons from the 80's as well I hope we see an annoucement for the cartoon shows-from 1981-1990-The Smurfs,GIJOE,Transformers,M.A.S.K,Heman etc- and from 1984-1986 Kid Video!-Man I miss those cartoons..20 years ago-Wow thats hard to believe.."
2,really bad movie,"I gave this movie a chance, and it is really bad. 3/4 into the movie I'm wondering when will this end? Suffice it to say that if you like really bad movies, then this is for you. But if you like quality look elsewhere. Chacotay from Star Trek Voyager is in this, and the 2 main actresses can act, otherwise it is awful. Watching this is sort of like studying the lint in your pockets but not as exciting."
4,eating raoul but not night of the comet???????,how can this be?? i'm trying to fill in a gap in my collection and it won't be complete without 'night of the comet' .. one of the great all time apocolyptic movies .. hurry the hell up and get it done.
5,"Great ""B"" movie!","I love this movie, it is a must for fans of 80's horror. This movie was scary when I was a child, but will definitely make you laugh now. Its classic end-of-the-world plot is made with two sisters surviving and doing what any girl would do: go to the mall. Add the hot Hector, stir in some zombies, top it off with scientists trying to save themselves and you have a great night at home watching movies."
4,Pleasant to refresh the childhood memories,"I've watched it twice when I was a kid, but never until the end. So years later I find this movie on amazon and keep thinking about it. It was on my mind, I couldn't let it go. Some classics work that way. So I've watched the whole movie, and to my surprise I liked it. It was slow paced, with a little of zombies and not too much of action, but I liked it anyway. Good classic."
3,"Very cheesy, and very fun","Night of the Comet reeks of the 80's, from it's costumes to it's style. Despite it's utter cheesy ludeness though, Night of the Comet manages to be enjoyable and fun for the most part, never taking itself too seriously in the process. Coming from an era where ""end of the world"" type films were popping up all over the place, Night of the Comet centers around two valley girl sisters (Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney) who awaken the day after a big time comet event to find that they are the only ones who haven't been turned to dust. They meet up with another survivor (Star Trek: Voyager's Robert Beltran) and are soon on the run from semi-zombified beasts. Night of the Comet is a fun blast for most of it's running time, but it quickly loses steam during the final acts of the film when government agents come into the picture. Despite that though, Night of the Comet is a fun ride while it lasts, and if you recall this fun B-movie, it's worth another look."
3,Old school horror and humor,"I know some people are giving this movie bad reviews. Probably because it is so old. It is meant to be funny and still make you jump.As long as you can keep that in mind, you will get a kick out of this movie.I'm only giving it 3 because I DO feel for the reviewers that think it's stupid but like I said, that's what it is all about."
2,NOT a zombie film.,"For zombie film fans, skip this movie. This is more a sci-fi post-apocalyptic film than one of the true zombie genre. And there's almost nothing good for you gore hounds.The good: Great acting, good special effects (for what little there are), interesting story and subplot, retro-80's fashion/music.The bad: First ""zombie"" arrives 35 minutes into the film. Total of 6-7 zombies in entire feature. Since this movie attempts to have a serious story, you can't help but question countless plot holes."
4,Cheerleaders and zombies,"Night of the Comet is a great piece of 80's sci-fi noir. How can you go wrong with ""Mags"" from The Last Starfighter and the cheerleader from Fast Times at Ridgemount High toting machine guns and fighting zombies? There's enough of a plot and a dose of suspense to keep you interested, while the gags and subtle, well placed jokes remind you that there's a tongue in cheek thing going on here. By the way, Spielberg probably ripped off the whole bodies turning to dust and leaving behind the clothes idea, used in this movie, in his version of War of the Worlds. (Not knocking Steven, those effects were killer.) This movie has been hard to find, glad it was finally released on DVD."
4,Great 80's zombie flick!!,I watched this movie so many times on cable back in the day. I think this one is a cult classic for zombie flicks. Good Humor and the right about of chesseness. I love this movie.
3,2-disc Kokomo/Rise & Shine,"I actually bought this to get one song, which I used to do in a band back in the 80's. Overall, the discs aren't too bad. But I wouldn't have bought them for any other reason than to get that one song. I am pleased to now have this song in my collection."
3,"Not Bad, But The Older Albums Are Better...","Unfortunately by this time, Frijid Pink were already past their prime and the point of no return when this album was released, and it turned out to be their swan song. Drummer Rich Stevers is the only original member left, and new vocalist Jo Baker is great, but not nearly as great as Kelly Green was. The best songs on this CD are ""Money Man"", ""Gonna Get It Yet"", and the humorous ""There Ain't No Rock And Roll In China"". Overall, not a bad effort, but I'll take their excellent debut album over this anytime."
1,a little band history,If you might be wondering why this doesn't sound much like the original FRIGID PINK.....After the release of the DEFROSTED lp....All the members (with the exception of the drummer) left the band....He revived the band name to do 2 more albums....Earth Omen and All Pink Inside....but they didn't sell.If you want the prime FP and dont want to spend a fortune on the boxed set...You can snag the first 2 cd's (the remaster 1st album and 2nd album are the same as what is in the box set...forget that 3rd disc..it isn't the real FP..)
1,Absolutely no flavor!,"I loved these when I was a kid. Unfortunately, these were very hard and had no flavor. You could tell just by the feel of the package. Should have sent them back."
3,** BUYER CAUTION** - There are two versions of this CD,"This CD (UPC 018111516327, Laserlight 15 163) has been released in two versions; the original 22 track (55 minute) CD and an 11 track (31 minute) CD. Furthermore, the 11 track CD contains only 10 unique songs since the music on tracks 7 & 8 is identical. The 22 track CD cover has ""55 MIN"" printed in the upper right corner while the 11 track CD cover is blank in the upper right corner.Prior to a purchase, I suggest the vendor be contacted to verify which version of the CD is being offered for sale. There is also an import version (UPC 4006408151630) of this CD that contains all 22 tracks.The 22 track CD contains an outstanding collection of harp and flute music; it deserves a five star rating. The 11 track CD is mediocre and deserves no more than a three star rating."
2,Get FRESH PESTO instead,"I purchased this item from a market because my local Costco ran out of their store brand Kirkland Signature pesto. Roland Pesto is disgusting and inferior; this brand has ruined meals. Go for the fresh stuff in the refrigerated section of supermarket instead. Or if you are a Costco member, look for their Kirkland Signature Pesto."
3,Worthy effort.,"This movie isn't the wrost movie on earth, but it was fun to watch. The story is very thrilling-a crew's ship crashes on an uncharted planet, with animals who come out in the dark-and their only hope is a convicted criminal who can only see in the dark. It may seem a little off-I mean, how many people in this world can only see in the dark? That's what good about it-the story is very different and very well told. The sound and vision is really cool. I escpecially like the way space looked-really cool. It's a ""unique"" theme movie. I'm sure many will enjoy it."
3,Unfulfilled potential...,"I had great hopes for this movie. An interesting and exciting premise, a multi-cultural cast, great cinematography and decent special effects.So what went wrong? The cast, while multi-cultural, were quite weak and didn't quiet have the edge as Sig. Weaver in Alien. The plot at times was confusing, and at times boring, as a bizzare side plot concerning the escaped prisoner unfolded. The Aliens weren't frightening as much as frustrating. Lacking the killer touch of Gigers' 'Alien' trilogy Aliens. Although the 'Only-come-out-when-it's-dark' touch held interest for a little while.Could have been better, but there are much worse."
3,Decent,"Nobody's Oscar pick, but pretty OK. Vin Deisel is pretty good, and Mitchell looks great. Plot is full of holes, but it's a pretty good time if you aren't asking too much of it."
5,First Riddick Movie,"Got the three Riddick movies as a gift and watched all three over the weekend. I can't believe I liked them so well. This first movie has beautiful but very bleak desert scenery. The characters are likeable and interesting, especially the Riddick character. Much of the movie takes place in the dark, as the title describes. It is suspenseful and I enjoyed watching it very much. I was sad that most of the characters didn't make it, but overall I found this to be very well done as far as science fiction. I liked it every bit as much as the old alien movies, maybe more."
5,brillant,"brillant. thats all i can say about thia movie. Vin Diesel is brillant in it and that voice!!!, it lacks no acting ability though the story line a weak in some parts, the films characters and it special effects definalty make up for it!!! buy it"
4,thats what i waiting for,"Hello i buy this product in december,its worth eny cent, picture is crisp detalic and very sharp i have regular dvd wersion and this is much much better,the sound is very good also but i cant notize is it better then on regular dvd, if you like this film you must have."
1,I'm sorry...,"I absolutely hated this movie. I know that I'm part of the minority on this forum, but by far, this was one of the worst movies that I saw last year. I did see it in a theatre, and I actually wanted my money back.I found the plot to be silly, the character underdeveloped, and the cinematography (while I understood the statement they were trying to make) to be... poor.I guess that I just can't get into a knock-off of other sci-fi movies that is supposed to be wonderful because it is shot overexposed. But that's just me."
3,A Pretty good Movie,"I had recently seen the Chronicles of Riddick movie, the sequal to this, and was interested in seeing this. It was a pretty good story, lots of suspense, and action. Though, I think they could've done without the constant use bad language (particularly f--k, f---ing, etc.) It would've been a perfectly fine show without all that in it.Overall, it's pretty good, and I might recommend it."
4,IN THE BEGINNING....,"IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS KIND OF SLOW, BUT THEN THE ACTION PICKED UP TOWARDS THE END. I LIKED IT ANYWAY, VIN DIESEL IS SOO HOT IN THIS MOVIE, AND IN CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK TOO."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I had a lot of expectations about this movie before seeing it. First off, I never heard anything good nor bad upon watching it. Secondly, the only good scene was when the dude breathes out fire and then you realize all the creatures that surround him. This movie has the worse characters that must have been picked up from the side of the road (the one's you see ""will work for food)."" About the only good thing was the special effects. I am big on special effects, but this movie is certainly not worth owning for that alone. My advise, rent it like I did and then thank yourself for not wasting your money on purchasing it or seeing it on the big screen."
2,an average film,Pitch Black is highly overrated. Everyone says it's good but I think it's just boring. The action doesn't kick in for at least an hour and when it starts to get interesting it's suddenly the end of the film. I'm sorry but I cant stand this film.
4,"Haven't seen ""Pitch Black""? Then you're in the dark!","Vin Diesel breaks out in this sci-fi alien thriller. The main focus is on Ridick (Diesel) who portrays a deadly criminal being transported on a commercial space craft. The ship crashes forcing the passengers to survive on a planet under three suns. What the survivors only later find out is that the planet is inhabited by vicious nocturnal aliens. With the only help coming from the man they fear most, the survivors must trust Ridick to lead them to safety. The cast is not a well known one consisting of many first time actors, yet with the strong character development of Diesel and believable roles of supporting actors, big names weren't needed. With its fantastic special effects and terrifying plot, Pitch Black is an awesome movie experience!"
4,Pitch Black,I saw this movie when first released on Video and found it too dark at first than again when released on DVD with a better pic and sound and now have it on HD with a clearer picture and sound so if you like Sci Fi movies recommended four out of five .
1,Marred by INCREDIBLY STUPID MTV editing,"Every time the fashionable but pointless MTV type jerky editing really pulls it down. Mark of a rank armature editor trying to cover up their own incompetence. I hate this type of pointless fashion so much I decided to post a warning.Too bad. ""Looks"" good otherwise. I'm sure others have mentioned it's derivative and clichéd."
2,5 STAR SLEEPER,"I was able to sleep soundly 15 minutes into the movie... Only felt the desire to freeze frame or slow mow, once, and that was not anything spectacular...Glad I only rented this, and that I can still take it back and find a descent movie before the rental store closes.."
2,Aliens go down t'pit,"Ohmigod! Our ship has been blown off course, a fact only discovered as it re-enters the atmosphere of a mysterious barren planet. Fortunately (the special effects budget not stretching to spacesuits) the planet has a breathable atmosphere, especially after knocking back a couple of bottles of vintage claret supplied by the ship's oddball!Golly! The planet has a secret! It hides an alien force of astonishingly obviously computer generated animals with big teeth. They are merciless. Everyone dies except for a couple of people who escape. That's about it."
4,Worthwhile and fun (if you're a kid),"My dad took me to see this at a movie theater, and I was expecting a pretty ordinary monster movie with which to while away my summer vacation, but I was surpised. Pitch Black was better than I expected, with the beautiful desert visuals and the ""Saturn rising"" eclipse scene... And the killer-turned-hero was pretty charming with his glowing eyes (oooh) under those cool sunglasses, and his neat silver dagger. He could've been an anime hero. I liked the crossdressing girl too--she was cute, and she didn't get killed, yay! This is a movie for teens who hang out in comics shops. More fun than Godzilla! More worthwhile than Titanic! School's out. Enjoy yourself. Get some candy and Pitch Black."
4,Good Scifi..,"There are certainly some angry people giving reviews here. How can you hate this if you like scifi. Vin's not a bad actor, he's just different. I think he's perfect at what he does. Pitch Black is not a bad film. Clearly somebody needs to take a time out...."
3,The first Riddick space opera,"A small bunch of humans are space wrecked on a desertplanet that has a black secret. Deep in the cavesthat riddle the planet are flesh eating bats who only come out when it is dark.With three suns that only happens on very special occasions every 22 years.Vin Diesel is actually a pretty decent actor, but his counter partin the pretty blond co-pilot is less believable, but puts in a pretty good effort.The bounty hunter who originally has Riddick in chainsis a better actor. Survival in the dark turns into an epic struggle.I liked the movie, but think this could have been done betterwith a better female lead."
4,PITCH BLACK SHOWS ITS COLORS,"I rented ""Pitch Black"" the other night, I have been wanting to see it for quite sometime when it came out in theaters due to the welcoming response it got from critics.Here is a picture that was not big big budget, had no stars, or gimmicks or big promotional plan. It came and went.I was totally blown away by the acting, the film techniques, the special effects, and the plot....Yes there was a plot and a surprise twist at the end which of course I will not give away.It was so nice to watch a movie not knowing what I was in for, not expecting what was going to happen next, and no trailers to spoil the ending.This was a nice treat, that did not get its due. ""Pitch Black"" should of been the sleeper hit for the summer. Here is a movie I found more interesting, plot provoking, and visually breathtaking - and movies like ""Gladiator"" win best picture....Go figure.It is worth a spin in the DVD."
2,"""Alien"" clone that trys",I usually don't waste time with these types of movies but when I saw the previews I thought it could be an ok movie. and it was pretty much . but thats about it. I will give this movie credit for adding some new twists to a tired genre. The monsters dont like light and there is some neat play with that but it doesnt really do much for the excitment. One saving grace of course is the future action star Vin Diesel. He plays a dangerous prisoner who can see in the dark and one total badass!This movie does have its fans im sure. It does have some originality . but not much
5,Awesome!,"I love this movie. Vin Diesel is on point. Action packed. I first saw this movie with a woman I later married. She was my best friend and the love of my life....until she betrayed me 5 years later, but that's a different story in itself. I've added this movie to my home library."
3,"on hindsight, its not such a bad movie, after all","I saw this when it came to the theater in my home town. I walked out disappointed mainly with the creature effects. But for that reason alone, I wouldnt put the whole movie down. The other weak point being the narration of Vin Diesel because you know right off the bat who will survive. But other than that, it is a decent flick over all. The terrestrial outlay is outstanding which lends to the overall stranded feeling of the film. The part when the planets allign and cause an eclipse is astounding, both visual and audio-wise. Yes, it is predictible. Yes, a lot of the film was ripped off from its predecessors like Aliens. However, for a cheap thrill ride, and a 90-minute break from reality, do yourself a favor and check out Pitch Black."
3,...depends on what gets you going.,"This movie is scary. For a while, at least. It is visually unlike anything Ridley Scott, George Lucas, or other mainstream directors ever turned out. Fresh? That would be pushing it a bit. But it is appealing. The screenplay - playing off of the same theme as Jaws - what you don't see can scare you - works. For a little while. There isn't anything to make you care about these characters as more than a few meet their demise.The sound quality is good, and Vin Diesel is excellent in his role. The other actors didn't have much material to work with. The character development is weak due to a so-so screenplay, but if you are just looking for a film that is more on the lines of a modern Blob or Thing, you might enjoy this. Right up there with Starship Troopers and Phantasm."
4,Best horror/sci-fi film since Aliens 2,"Although not the most original science fiction film, Pitch Black is a blast to watch. From the at times disorienting tinting of the early scenes to the excellent use of sound effects, Pitch Black is a worthy addition to any science fiction lover's collection. The creatures themselves are fast, viscious and scary. While there could be more character development, there is enough so that we actually care about the criminal's apparent redemption. This one is worth watching again and again. It's destined to be one of the most under-appreciated films of the year."
4,It's a pretty cool movie.,"I have the unrated version of this movie and I think its pretty cool. I have rented the rated version and i like this one better. You do notice that added footage. Some People say you dont notice it, if you have seen both versions of this movie you do. I like the bleatching effect they did to this film, I think it give it a cool feel that wouldnt would work with other movies of this type. Finally, This is a movie that if you have kids you might be able to let them watch it and not worrie that they might have nightmares."
1,waste of time,"i did not see this at the theatre, and don't recall if it was at the theatre, however i did notice the alien type filming, but also sorta reminded me of mad max due to the accents of the characters, and t he desert envionment.this film should have been made at a faster pace, to slow, and to dumb of actors speaking just to comsume time.after 1 hour..i stopped it, and got it ready to ship back to the rental company...! vin diesel was ok, not super crazy about him.. or see what other's see in his acting ability."
1,"""quick, lets act in this movie""","great visuals,good premis, who ever put this cast together, well, needs a vacation, BAD!the entire cast sleepwalked through the entire movie. next time get REAL actors.enuf said."
2,muddled and dark.........,"When I saw the previews recently of The Chronicles of Riddick,I thought it might be interesting to see Pitch Black. Wrong.From the first part of it, it looked cheap. That was my firstclue and from there it goes downhill. I frankly think Dieselwas much better in Fast and Furious than he was in this.But I must say that he alone was the incentive to last as longas I did. As far as the monsters, that go bump in the night,anybody who compares them to those in Alien must be blind anddeaf......I found them interesting but definitely not scary, or maybe you needed to be there to see them in person? They reminded me in a way of the raptors from Jarassic Park particularly when they are congregating on the launch pad at the end of the film.Total waste of time.Perhaps 'Chronicles' will be different?It definitely looks a bit more polished."
5,better than alien,firstly i must own up that this film nonplused me.i was not waiting such a film.this is better than so-called great matcless alien.needless to say more.a must-see.by the way star of movie is pitch-black-monsters.
3,Better than I had thought it would be,"Before Vin Diesel got billed as the next action hero, he starred as a convicted murderer being transported on a ship through space. Among other passengers on the ship are a tough captain (Radha Mitchell), a drug addicted cop (Dazed & Confused's Cole Hauser), and some other characters played by Keith David and Farscape's Claudia Black. When the ship crashes on an uncharted planet, the surviving passengers are forced to band together to survive against the planet's indigenous vicious creatures. The plot and storyline are far from original, but the excellent acting (including the surprisingly well acted role by Diesel) and superb directing from David Twohy (The Arrival) make Pitch Black a high grade B movie that is a great guilty pleasure."
5,I bought this after reading these reviews.,Don't you hate it when you follow someone's recommendation and end up buying something you hate? That didn't happen here! I have watched this movie 5 or 6 times now and I will thoroughly enjoy watching it more. This movie is probably my favorite of the genre. Vin Diesel absolutely ROCKS as a villian with a heart. I can't wait to see future works with him.
3,Juicy Popcorn cruncher,"This was a fun movie to watch on the weekends with the wind blowing outside, ice forming on the windows--sort of like the weather in this really effective excursion into fantasy. The actor who makes this movie really work is the sexy, powerful Vin Diesel. My one gripe: he never took off his jersey! Some scenes would have benefited creatively if the audience could have seen much more of Disel in the altogether(it's my same complaint with 'Gladiator'--Russell Crowe is always covered up). We wanted to see all of Diesel's muscles at work. I could see this guy easily in the Marlon Brando role in ""The Wild Ones."" Diesel will be around for a long time."
5,Fantastic Film,"Ok, I know I'm supposed to specifically talk about the DVD, but I saw this movie in the theater and I loved it. The special effects were so artfully done, they cast the perfect mood for the film. The feeling of dread and suspense hardly ever leave you throughout the movie. The scripting and fine cast coupled with the special effects really worked well for me. So many Sci-Fi movies suffer from painfully cheesy and cliche'd dialogue and ""Pitch Black"" says only what it has to. Great Film!"
4,don't look behind you..JUST RUN!,"This movie is a blast. Story is a space crew crash lands on aplanet that has been scorched and has 3 suns blaring down on itin the daytime.Only problem is there are vicious, nocturnal creatures that seemingly attack anything that moves. So the story goes a simpleyet sophisticated tale of survival and ""lets get the hell outtahere fast!"".The SFX are fine, acting is credible with toughguy Vin Diesel as the anti-hero battling for survival against these nocturnal nasties whi ch look like a cross between vampire bats & pre-historic pterodactylscheck it out..watch it in Pitch Black"
4,A Sci-fi blast!,I just saw Pitch Black for the first time and I didn't expect much but I must say that I really liked it. Critics called it a disappointing second film from the director of the Arrival but even though I liked Arrival I think this is a big step above that. Vin Diesel gives the biggest break through performance of the year next to Hugh Jackman's in X-Men. Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser also give fine performances. Besides having a good cast this movie is also full of a lot of nail biting suspense. It doesn't only come from the aliens that attack when it's dark but from Vin Diesel's character as well because you never know if you can trust him even if he is the hero. Diesel's so good at Riddick that I wouldn't mind seeing him reprise the role sometime. This is a lot better than the other Sci-Fi's of this year like Super Nova and Mission to Mars so check it out
4,Great sci fi adventure,"I loved this movie. Vin Diesel plays his role so well and though he says little his intentions and thoughts come through the screen due to great directing and great acting. The deserted planet they land on in interesting yet simple, allowing more time for development of the plot, characters, and special effects. My favorite scene is the eclipse which is mesmerizing and beautiful. I didn't like the last few minutes, but I enjoyed the movie up until that point and would recommend it to sci fi adventure fans."
4,Gets Even Better With Repeated Viewings.,"When I Saw this film at the Cinemas, I Must Admit.. I was Not Blown Away, A few of the Stupid Lines got Stuck in my head and I felt a bit Disappointed. But after seeing the barrage of Disappointing Sci/fi films that followed this one, (""Mission to Mars"", ""Red Planet"", ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""Titan: AE"") ""Pitch Black"" suddenly looked Alot Better, it came out to hire, I hired it, and since then, It's gotten better with every viewing.The Near-Unknown Cast are all Above Average, the Direction is Good, the Pacing is Swift and the Effects are Great. What More could one ask from a Monster Movie."
2,Disappointing.,This movie start well but it gets boring and uninspiring afterward. Overall: Mediocre.
3,Sci-Fi Thriller,"When their space ship crashes they're stranded on a planet with two suns. When an eclipse occurs, flesh eating creatures come out from under the ground with one weakness, light. The main character has a nice body. Good action scenes, I enjoyed watching the movie."
1,Art imitating night.,"This had all the makings of an interesting project, but ultimately it falls between two stools. Is it an art project, or is it a Hollywood blockbuster?The premise is simple; put Vin Diesel and some other actors in a windowless room, turn out the lights and then film the action. With only your hearing to guide you, two hours of mayhem ensue as Diesel kicks off in a big way when Rahda Mitchell states that ""The Fast and the Furious"" was rubbish.However, eventually the noise of screams, breaking glass and even a screeching tyre noise (suggesting to me that some effects have been added in for comic effect) becomes tiresome. Only the hardcore fans of Diesel's gravelly tones will make it through two hours of this.Astonishingly, this video doesn't feature subtitles which is a disgrace.Unimpressive, and a poor addition to the Diesel collection. Leave it alone. Leave it!"
2,Just a rehash,"With all the hype I guess I was expecting something more. When the movie was over I simply felt that I had seen it all before. Wish I had rented it first. Just my own opinion but this movie falls into an ever growing list of movies which rely on special effects alone. The story line is used simply to wrap the special effects in. Don't get me wrong, I love special effects but I think the days when they can carry the movie is over. We need some brains along with our effects."
4,It'll Make You Jump,"I usually don't get too into Sci-Fi movies, but this one was an exception. Always something around the corner to grab your attention. It is hard to pinpoint what makes the film so good, but I think it has to do with several things that the director did to let the viewer use his or her own imagination. For instance, it is never known what planet they are on. Only a vague idea is giving as to why each person is the trip. During different times in the movie, the color goes to a pale look. The combonation of the scenery and the color paints a very descriptive picutre of what kind of harsh weather conditions they are experiencing. The ""alien"" they encounter lives in the dark and they also show signs of being very intelligent, so it is sure to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat."
5,Awesome!,"Let me just say Vin rocked in this.Many say its similar to aliens, sure but not all of the movie it like aliens. Go see this for what it is,not to compare it with aliens."
1,Dumb and Boring!,"I saw this movie in the theatre at the ""urging"" of a friend and his roommate. I came out of the theatre realizing I had wasted my money. My friend came out of the thearre realizing he had to go to the movie of my choice the next time we went out. I will admit I'm not much of a sci-fi fan, but I do have ones I like. This was not one of them.Rent it before you buy it. Enough said."
1,Unbelievably bad,"People actually get PAID to make this stuff?? Bad plot, bad acting, bad directing and utterly abysmal cinematography made this movie go straigt to the top of my list--of the WORST movies of all time. Not even worth the [money] to RENT, much less any price you'd pay to buy it. Too bad [I can't] assign 0 stars, that's still more than this picture deserves."
1,Pitch Dull......,"This is only the second film I have seen that I considered walking out of.The plot is at best predictable, the characters shallow. The tension is laughable. In fact at one point I even considered this a comedy, a fact supported by the non-existing acting.Purchase this at your peril....there are a lot better films of the Sci-Fi genre out there...."
1,"Good idea, badly excuted",I have one word for this movie: LAME. Only good part was the ship crashing down on the planet. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT -ALIEN-
4,Surprisingly good,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, I didn't even catch it until it appeared at the second run theater at my school. It actually turned out to be a great movie. Vin Diesel(Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room) put in a great performance, very convincing, as does the rest of the supporting cast. Keeps you on the edge of your seat through most of the movie, and I highly recommend it."
3,"Solid ""Aliens"" Genre Flik","I'm not a huge Vin Diesel fan, but looking past his one dimensional acting ability. Pitch Black is a good movie. Not great, but worth owning if you are a fan of this type of movie. The bleached out look of the movie takes a little getting used to, it kind of detracts from the plot development. I kept adjusting my t.v. thinking my contrast was out of sync. The alien creatures are realistic and bloodthirsty, if not particularly cunning. Well above a B-movie status, but not quite a blockbuster, I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars. Amazon only allows for whole numbers so the 3 stars should actually be 3 1/2."
2,Aliens...it is not,"I have to be honest, I really wanted to like this film, but I was ultimately disappointed. Vin Diesel was interesting as the anti-hero, but the effects, save for a few scenes, were cheesy and obviously digitally done. This film wanted so badly to be mentioned in the same breath as truly great sci-fi films like 'Aliens,' but in the end doesn't even come close. It actually comes off more like a late night B-movie from the Sci-Fi channel. It's alright for a rental, but I doubt you would find yourself watching it over and over."
2,A good B Movie,"This movie is pretty good, but the hard thing for me is that just about the whole movie is very dark. If you like horror combined with Sci-fi, then you probably will like it.A group of people are stranded on a planet. the only way off is to hike accrost this barrin wastland to get to another space camp. unfortunitly, this planet is loaded with flesh eating creatures. The slightest light will keep them away, but stray out of the light, and you are instant dinner for these huge powerfull creatures."
3,"Overhyped. Not really scary, not so good.","VIN DIESEL takes action after a starship spaceship crew crashlands on a mysterious planet where creatures roam only at night. When the eclyipse hits at 22 years to the dot, the planet goes pitch black, and the crew must fight to survive the man eating beasts.MY REVIEW:""When buying this movie, I thought it was going to be great. There wasn't anything great about it at all. Vin Diesel did pretty good, as did the rest of the cast of the film, besides all the swearing that came out of their mouths. There is some action, no thrills, no chills, no spills, not much realism to the creatures, and when the films starts to pick up, it ends in like a half hour. This film, I have to admit, was better than RED PLANET and MISSION TO MARS. Enjoy some of the action that lies in this film, but forget the rest of the cheapness to the film.""- MJV & the Movies."
5,Masterpiece that gets better everytime,"I have been a huge fan of Pitch Black since I caught it in theatres. After owning the DVD I realize that this is less of a monster movie, but more of a psychological thriller. The character development makes the film and their actions will shock you as much as the action/gore. Look past the CGI and you will be very impressed with high quality plot and character developedment in this low budget thriller."
3,"Not bad, not good.","Bad beginning, good middle, bad ending. The start of this movie had me looking at the clock wondering how much more of the 1 hour and 48 minutes I had left. By the middle, I was drawn in by the interesting main characters (the captain and the prisoner), only to be turned away by the desperate attempt at a suspensful ending. What turned me off the most was the needless death of one of the only two characters that you were able to develope any sort of feeling for.Final Verdict: Ok, if desperate to see a movie."
3,Buy the regular version of this DVD,The quality of this Blu Ray DVD was not so great. This movie was so-so. I personally liked the Chronicles of Riddick better. So I would recommend buying the regular DVD if you really liked this movie.
3,blah...in an ok way...,"I say 'blah' in a way that is like shaking your hand and saying, 'so so'. This is becuase although the actors are spirited and strong,we get to know some bits about them, the ending is just...ugh! blah! I personally did not like the ending. I think it was a bad way to end the movie. Besides the ending it was a fantastic movie. I find it ...interesting..."
2,The special effects were cool...,"And that was about it. The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet. When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died. The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer). The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever."
2,Lacks Imagination,"It might be a good alien rip-off, but why not just watch aliens? The action and special effects are good, but the plot has so many holes... for example, what do these aliens eat over the years when there is sunlight? Pretty massive population of these creatures when there are no other discernable sources of food except for the little glow bugs, who make a surprise appearance when the characters need them most. And the night happens only once every ten years! Why would these types of creatures evolve on a planet where they usually can't hunt? Seems a little forced..."
3,"""The Blair Witch Project of Outer Space""","I think this is what you get if you mix together the Blair Witch Project and Galaxy Quest. Take a mediocre and predictable sci-fi story, throw in a group of actors that seem to have been instructed to act as badly as is feasibly possible, and then throw in one actor (Vin Diesel) who somehow is able to go counterclockwise and turn in a powerful performance. Mix this all together and the result is something unique, different, and downright weird. There were times where I thought I had my DVD in wrong and that the real movie was on the other side. This unusual mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly winds up with about a 3 out of 5 in my book."
5,Best movie ever!,"this is the best movie i've ever seen.Its suspensful,and you never knoww whats gonna happen next.Van Deisal was the best actor in the movie, and i loved the design of the creatures."
2,Wasted Opportunity,"This movie has a great premise: ship crash lands and survivors must face some very ugly and vicious creatures who come out during an eclipse. I must say I had great expectations about it and was quite disappointed. Most of the actors seem to be just going through the motions, never really getting into the story. The most annoying aspect: the escaped convict-hero who spends most of the movie delivering BS one line comments as if it were high philosophy."
1,Will not Buy this one.,I watched the chronicles of riddick and enjoyed it. I rented pitch black which was the first in the series. I was not impressed. the cussing did nothing to enhance it' it made me wonder if the writer and directr did not have a dictionary to consult. also there was no tie in between pitch black and the chronicles of riddick. in fact pich black made no sence. the chronicles of riddick stands on its own.
1,This one S.U.C.K.S.,"I lost track of the movie when they crashed on the planet. Stopped watching after this, because of one main thing:Extremely bad acting.I don't think I have seen worse acting in a movie. So I couldn't bare to watch it any longer, because I felt I was in the middle of a movie where they actually paid for everything except for the actors.I know this review isn't as throughout as all the other ones here, but there is no more to say about this movie. I recommend this movie to nobody, it just is pure garbage, and can only be unmatched in a garbage pile. Why any people would achieve at giving this movie 5 stars, is beyond my world, in what I call movie quality. Even the somewhat interesting extras on what makes this the DVD version, doesn't help this movie at all. Nope. Please remember to recycle.-"
2,Not too hot,"Not sure what I was expecting but it was a let down as far as the movie goes, would not suggest to other to spend the bucks on this one."
3,Average Space Monster Movie,"I really enjoyed the first half and then it got sort of lazy. There was room for more dialogue and character development. It would have also been more interesting if different characters had lived and died, but it insisted on going against the audiences' expectations...trying too hard to set itself apart from every other ""killer alien"" or ""stranded"" action adventure. It's still worth a rental for fans of this genre."
4,Good Adventure,I really liked this show and especially the actor who played the pilot. I thought she was the best of the group.
4,Great Sci Fi and excellent special effects.,Very original story about a planet with 3 Suns and a coming eclipse to become the mother of all eclipses. Excellent original story and well played out with great special effects. You have to get past some of the non human creatures looking a lot like Predator but other than that a good movie.
4,Pitch Black Delivers The Fear,"With no more genuinely scary movies produced lately, this movie delivers the fear. Pitch Black has to be one of the last greatest scary movies in recent years. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times and it delivers the suspense. Set on a distant planet in the future, this sci-fi film gives you everything you want in a movie-suspense, action, and drama."
4,Grab your popcorn and get ready for a very good SCI-FI,"The first 10-15 min. of the movie you don't have too much of an idea of what's going on accept a classic start, with a spaceship and its passangers all sleeping until the ship reaches the destination but something goes wrong. You are not sure who the nice guy is and who is the bad guy. The movie does a good job of taking its time to develop the plot. Beautiful cinematography, very interesting landscapes and some really cool, special effects. And the pace and terror gets better and better as the movie progresses. This is definitely a movie which will keep you glued to your couch and chew on that popcorn as hard as you can. Great Sci-fi , not many of those come around."
1,ripping off the unwary,"To charge $1 for one of these is crazy. Either someone is mistaken on quantity or is a person of, let us say, poor personal qualities.Anyway, no one would want/need one."
4,Good Information and Graphics,"I use this book regularly to look up names found in myths. The graphics layout and presentation of the book are excellent, and the book usually contains the information I am looking for.My only caveat might be that...the book is priced at the high end of what one ought to pay for a book of this size."
4,enjoyed it... though kids will destroy it,bought it as i am wanting to become a watchmaker... perfect buy for price and educational purposes... however... buying for kids is a mistake... it is incredibly undurable and probably not fun for things that like spidermen and barbies
1,DEPRESSING!!,"OMG!... Where is the love?...After 3 chapters, I actually threw this book against the wall. It was with great effort and lots of teeth-gnashing that I finished this book. From cover to cover, it was filled with depressing events, heartache after heartache, struggle after struggle. I didn't feel as if this should have been called a romance at all! I'm still waiting on that feeling where you say ""ahhh"", that was good! I've loved Mrs. Johnson's earlier works. Her last 2 books have left me wondering if she's lost her touch. I didn't enjoy this one at all.This is just my opinion."
3,It's a bit repetitive and simple,"After seeing the great reviews on this book I thought I was going to love it. It's good, but not great. It does seem to focus on about 5 companies and it just felt repetitive. I had high hopes and there are some pretty good gems of information but I would just not expect any earth shattering moments."
4,Solid summary of Basics of Customer Service,"""Excellent customer service"" is a the frequent promise, which is SELDOM achieved. This book is a good guide to how the elements of really great customer service can be identified and cultivated in an organization. While it is directed more to the larger enterprise, the principles can be applied to small business also."
1,H2O3,"This came in a good container, all the way to my front door. The mailman threw it down on my porch breaking the lid causing the container to empty out. The article had no protection underneath,only on top."
1,Bad business,"ABC offered this product, as well as all its products, with a free shipping promotion if items ordered totaled $100.00 or more. Naturally, due the weight of this item, the free shipping offer was a fantastic promotion. Unfortunately, shortly after ordering, I was notified that ABC was ""out of stock"" and, therefore, my order was cancelled. Now . . . perhaps I am being inordinately suspicious but I suspect the order was cancelled due to ABC's unwillingness to honor promotion. IMO, it either should not offer products for sale that are ""out of stock"" or merely suspend the transaction until products are, again, in stock. Bad business practice."
3,too many air bubbles,"It fits well but i cannot get the air bubbles out from under it. And when I took it off to try again , it was worse."
2,Equivalent??,"holds a charge, powered up my camcorder, & fell right off!!! Gonna have to rely on the handyman's secret weapon; duct tape."
2,"You get what you pay for, I should have paid more","These shorts are very thin and offer little coverage at the gym. Perfect for exhibitionists. The waistband is unattractive, I would never wear them without a t-shirt hanging over the waist."
3,OK shorts,"These shorts are good for working out in or for chores around the house. I wear a size 8-10 and bought a large. While I can make these shorts work, they are too big for me. I wish I would have ordered a size medium. All in all, these will work if you want shorts that are comfortable. I would have given a higher rating if the shorts had fit me better."
1,Not happy...,I purchased 3 pairs of these shorts to replace a favorite pair I purchased 2-3 years ago. The new shorts were made of VERY THIN material. I dried them on low heat - they shrunk significantly and I can't wear them.
1,Shrinks A LOT,"The shorts were a good fit for the first wear but shrunk down to almost unwearable with one wash. If you are going to buy this product (which I wouldn't recommend), buy at least a size larger than you normally would!"
5,Great value,"These are just the style of gym shorts I like, and the price is great! I only purchased the cotton blend colors (graphite and grey), so as not to have the shrinking issues the other reviewer spoke of. I am very pleased!"
4,Worth about half the price ...,"Since I've purchased Russell Athletic apparel before, I know that their togs are very basic (okay for 'round the house). They shrink - buy 'up' a size or two. So these shorts are about what you can expect ... except they would be more appropriately priced at $5.99 or $6.99 tops."
3,A Little Thin,"These shorts are comfortable and fit well, but they are a little thinner than I would expect (as in see-through almost). Granted, they are inexpensive, but I guess I expect more from Russell Athletic clothes."
1,Less than exciting shorts,"The shorts were fine but not at all the quality I expected. They were much thinner than the ones I was trying to replace. They were also a very dull color of gray compared to the usual, light gray color."
2,Inaccurate description,"Well-made product, but bulky; and It's described as having 18 hooks -- big lie!! Total of SEVEN hooks, for $33. Way too expensive for what it is."
3,"Great spacing, bad tilt.","This belt rack has great spacing for lots of belts. Unfortunately, because it slides, the track allows the rack to tilt forward, causing my belts to slowly slide off of the rack. I didn't need it to slide, so my husband removed the track and screwed through the wood. That fixed the problem and I'm happy! If you need this product to perform as intended, you might want to keep looking."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE IS 'NOT' WHAT YOU WILL BE RECEIVING! WHAT IS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE IS A COMPLETE WELCH ALLYN FIBER OPTIC SIGMOIDOSCOPE / ANOSCOPE SET THAT TYPICALLY SELLS FOR OVER WELL OVER $2,000.00.WHAT IS ADVERTISED IS JUST THE 'LIGHT HANDLE' (MODEL #73210) FOR THIS KIT, NOTHING ELSE."
1,walkabout,"DONT LET THE OTHER REVIEWS THROW YOU> I honestly thought that the end credits were the best part of this movie. I thought that the acting was bad, the sound was horrible,there was no plot and there were quite a few tasteless scenes.I felt ripped off as the Criterion Collection usually has GOOD movies. Im sorry to say but someone goofed in picking this movie for the collection."
1,What was this about?,"Dumb, dumb, dumb. Walkabout made no sense at all. Very few lines were said, half of which seemed to be in another language and half of the rest in screaming so loud that it couldn't be understood. The little annoying boy could never be understood at all, and the chick seemed to be that same way a lot of the time. Then, that stupid native guy came along and brought a bunch of naked tribe members along. That made no sense. Next came half an hour of pointlessness. For half an hour, the chick skinny-dipped, the native Australian guy went hunting, and the little annoying boy was a pain. And another stupid thing- why did they have a weather baloon launch? It made no sense with a weather balloon being launched in the middle of a movie about people surviving in the Australian outback with some native wearing a thong. Oh- why did they show so many closeups of that guy's thong? With all that put together, I think this movie was about the stupidest thing I have ever seen."
3,Region 2 Unable to watch,Saw the movie many years ago. I purchased a copy to share with others. Film was a region 2 film unable to watch the film. My mistake did not know about region codes.
2,Wonderful Movie - Poor DVD Quality,"The previous reviewer wrote: ""It's a beautiful, strange film.""I TOTALLY agree...it's a gem. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is terrible. You wonder if the film and DVD mastering equiment weren't discovered IN the outback covered with lizard droppings! Not only grainy and dusty, but after the 2nd chapter the sound and picture were totally out of sync. The lips move...the words come out 3-4 seconds later. This is the first time I've seen the film...I can't imagine that this is what the the filmaker intended.I returned the DVD, and I suggest interested buyers wait until an ""all clear"" message has been posted here. I'm sure all the copies are this way.Regards, Scollay END"
4,"good, as long as you haven't read the novel","well, this movie is filled with spectacular shots of the desert, and deals with themes that the novel didn't touch on (and does it well, like the contrast between the desert and the city), but, if you've read the novel the changes in the plot can almost be aggravating, because it was changed completely from what it originally was. If you want to see this for the landscape it'll blow you away, if you want to see it as a representation of the book it will be a disappointment."
1,Very Unlike the Book,"This was a very confusing and inaccurate movie adaption of the book ""Walkabout"". I read the book for 7th grade English, and it is very beautiful and moving. It gives information about Australian plantlife and about the Aboriginals. Sadly, the movie is very different, and it is very untrue to the book. Some examples of the mistakes: 1. In the book, the kids are from South Carolina, but in the movie, they are from Australia. 2. In the book, they are in a plane crash. (In the movie, the father tries to kill the kids, burns the car, and then shoots himself.) 3.The girl is supposed to be 13 and the boy is supposed to be 8. In the movie, the boy acts like he's 3!!! 4.Although I can see why they would do this, the boy isn't supposed to be wearing a loincloth. He is supposed to be naked!!! And that's just in the first 15 minutes! So if you really want to know the story of Walkabout, read the book, don't watch the movie."
1,What were they thinking of,"This movie is right up there with Killer Tomato's.As a previous reviewer said , you do not know what the characters names are. The father is writing and making notes from a map then tries to shoot the children, ends up setting the car on fire and killing himself.If ever a book was trashed this movie director did it. Read the book please. In the book there is a plane crash, in this movie the father drives out into the ""bush"" the girl if she had any sense would would have followed the marks the car tires had made and made it back to civilization instead she walks the other way."
4,I enjoyed it,"Sorry all you puritans and perfectionists - I didn't know ""there was a book"". I bumped into this in my local library and borrowed it. It's very good - and we spent 7 mos in Aust in 1995 - so I've personally seen the rotten treatment the Ab's have had."
4,Strange flow,"This movie will capture the mind of the most imaginative romantics, but it will bore the person who wants to have more action/dialog. It is a strange movie and it is not for everyone. There are several bizar insertions which are confusingly disjointed from the rest of the movie. This movie would almost qualify as a documentry on the Outback, and shares many traits with that other movie type. The movie has fabulous imagry of the Australian location shooting."
4,Really nice movie,"Got a recommend for this movie from a friend. It is really a nice movie.The picture quality is O.K., but not really like in bluerays as the ALIEN-collection.There are english subtitles, but they can only be accessed by the remote control and not by the movie-menu.As I live in Europe I had some issue with the region code which is A only.I do not understand that such an old movie is released without allowing region B and C."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Walkabout has its share of interesting scenes, but the acting is often poor and the characters are not very believable (**spoiler** e.g. the children don't seem even mildly perturbed that their father tried to kill them and then killed himself); watch it for its beautiful scenes of the outback, not its coherency."
1,Not what I expected.,beautiful shot this film looks amazing. interesting story. i just couldnt get past all the animal deaths. they were too much for me.
2,RIGHT DVD WRONG REGION,"The DVD was on time and the right one, but the computer said it could only play on REGION 4 , the UNITED STATES is in Region 1,Have to set the system up to play this DVD and then Reset it to play all my other movies."
4,Confused?,"I watched this film on the Independent Film Channel maybe 10 years ago. My recollection of it is that it is an excellent film. I came here to purchase this film and ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" (also excellent) on dvd. I read various reviews rated from 5 to 1 stars and am now wondering if this film on dvd is the same one I watched so long ago. Has it been reformated? Have scenes been deleated or added? I read that some ppl who recalled it as an excellent film were somewhat disappointed after the passage of time. Is this due to a change in the format of the film? I recall the storyline and Australian scenery as awesome. Can someone tell me if the dvd release has changed the film, somewhat like the changes made to the dvd of ""Amadeus""? (glad I recorded that movie on vhs!)Thanks..."
3,Blu Ray Glitch,"I really wanted to see this but the BD freezes at the 48 minute mark. Tried this on 2 other players with the same results. I liked the 48 minutes that I did get to see but can't give this more than 3 stars. Will return to Amaz. and if I get one that works, I'll revise."
3,"An intertesting film, just plain different",This is an interesting film and one of the more unusual mainstream films I have seen. Despite the full frontal nudity (obviously non-sexual nudity) It is an overall good film.A young woman and her little brother are abandoned in the Australian outback by their father who has committed suicide. The two encounter an young aborigine man who is on 'walkabout' a ritual where individuals are sent out to see if they can survive on their own. He eventually leads them back to a populated area.The original music score by John Barry is superb and sounds very similar to the music he did in the earlier James Bond films.The Criterion collection DVD has an excellent audio commentary by director Nick Roeg and leading actress Jenny Agutter who was in the film. Jenny Agutter is also well known for her role in the film Logan's Run. This movie
2,Disappointed after reading great reviews,"This movie got great reviews so I looked forward to watching it. I'm an Aussie living overseas so like to watch as many Aussie movies as I can, and almost always enjoy them. This was the exception. There were just too many parts of the movie where the story line didn't make a lot of sense. Then there was all the 70's ""artsy"" stuff which was a turn off. I will keep it in my collection but probably won't watch it again."
5,Great tea - my first green tea,"I really liked this tea. Besides green tea bags from Bigelow, etc., this was my 1st loose tea like this. It is a pale color, which I like because I worry about tea staining my teeth. The taste is sweet so I do not use any sugar or sweeteners. It's had a beneficial affect on my spouse's blood pressure, which is why we tried it. I thought I would need a tea ball, but I really don't - the leaves sink to the bottom. If I ingest an occasional leaf, it has a sweet, nutty flavor."
4,"""hull the blockheads, whether they will or no."" (ch. 45)","This is the second of three books Melville published in quick succession--after Redburn in 1849, and before Moby-Dick in 1851. If you read them in that order, you can actually witness Melville's powers as an author growing. White-Jacket has passages that approach the difficulty of Moby-Dick, but it also has not a few chapters that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. It's not the best of Melville, but it is certainly brilliant! (Smokers, and non-smokers alike, should take a look at ch.91)"
4,Questionable Authority,"If you find yourself in a position where the individuals in authority over you are, in the actual state of affairs, your moral inferiors, then on this level alone you will be able to appreciate this book."
5,A MUST!,This album is simply stunning. It is some of the most beautiful and compelling music I have ever heard. It is a MUST for any music fan.
3,songs are great --but those drums have to go!!,"The songs selection on this album are great. BUT -- why are the drums seemingly drowning out Willie? -- and why are the drums seemingly out of step with the song type ; i.e. - sad thoughtful song should be accompanied by simular drimming (if any) - should be released with out emphasis on the druming. Could have been a sucessfull as SPIRIT but, not with those damn drums!!"
3,Can you spell OVERPRODUCED?,"I have been a hard-core Willie fan since the first time I heard him - live, just his incredible voice and his guitar. I still believe that is the best way to hear him. Sparse arrangements or rip-roaring Good Hearted Woman romps with his friends showcase his considerable talents best. Although I love the latin flavor, which suits him, you can hardly hear his voice over the DRUMS and other INCREDIBLY OVERDONE INSTRUMENTATION. His beautifully nuanced performances are lost. I am a sound engineer, and I actually find this album painful to listen to. I give it 3 stars because nothing Willie does could have less."
2,"The drums ruined it for me, too","Like several other reviewers, I'm a youngish but longtime ""closet"" Willie fan. I knew of Teatro's critical acclaim, I like a lot of Lanois' other work, and was expecting to be impressed. Some of the songwriting is lukewarm compared to his classics, but Willie and his guitar work are as fine as ever, and Emmylou Harris' backup is a perfect fit. But those drums-- a crime! They are pushed absurdly too far forward in the mix, insisting ""hey listen to me! ME!"" Considering how soulless they are, why are they allowed to dominate? Especially the cymbals are literally nonstop and repetitive, and drove me nuts. I went from primed for a good listening session to drop-jawed disbelief.This is my first review ever, and it's too bad that it took such a disappointment! Dig through some of Willie's back catalog, where he is backed far better, before buying Teatro."
2,It's Alive! A L I V E.....!!,"This is a real Frankenstein's monster of a CD. Too mannered, too conscious of its own genre-hoppin' strangeness. Don't get me wrong -- the songs are pretty good (except for Lanois' New Age nightmare ""The Maker""), but the songs aren't really the point, are they? Plus, you can clearly see the bolt through Willie's neck on the back cover shot (not really)."
1,"not Willie, a replay of old stuff, packaged differently,","Emmy Lou is miscast, never a backup, she and Willie do no meld. Willie should stop being the star and let others do their thing. Playing the guitar is one thing , playing it well is another.Stop with all the retros of old songs, just a way to make money. Better look at Lyle Lovett, he is playing, and Writing good Texas music, Being an ICON means you have to maintain a level , this album appears to be commercial, not musically new or inventive. Emmy Lou should be ashamed of her self, her talents are way above this."
4,WILLIE IS RIGHT ONE IT AS USUAL,"From a guy that likes selections from country to rap, Willie is still the greatest there is. His lyrics still bring chills to my 20 something skin. Everyone that appreciates good music should take an hour and listen. I grew up on Willie Nelson's music and he still has the same musical power in this album that he has had over the decades."
4,pretty doggoned good,"This isn't as good as ""spirit,"" in my opinion, though it's still wonderful and i like Harris' background vocals. Her cracked and raspy voice blends well with Nelson's. I didn't like the sometimes-overwhelming drums, but the album works well despite that."
5,Beautiful -- I play it when doing concentrated work,"I play it when doing concentrated work at the computer -- like intricate spreadsheets. Beautiful, haunting. I agree that the drums are a bit much on some tracks. Overall, one of my favorite albums."
4,Readable and practical advice.,"This is a good, general book for managers, especially those who own or manage a small business and don't have the resources of a corporation for guidance. In spite of the glut of business management books on the market, it still amazes me to witness managers repeat common mistakes in the areas this book covers: how to hire, how to fire, how to conduct and document performance reviews, etc. This is not a business strategy book; it's simply a ""do's and don'ts"" guide for managers. I have heard Bob Rosner speak, and recommend that, if you like the book, you should consider him at a company function."
1,Huh?,"Have any of you actually read this book? The reviews, including one from the author himself, read like a list of author's friends rounded up to praise their pal. The book's not bad, but c'mon lets get real here. There's hardly anything new here."
2,The Boss's Survival Guide is an average book at best,"The Boss's Survival Guide is at best an average book. It appears to be merely a superficial compilation of newspaper articles from the past several years.In addition, the authors are annoyingly ""policically correct"" in their use of grammer and in the first paragraph of page 383, they clearly show their anti-gun bias.Also, in the section on sexual harrassment, the authors omit two necessary items:1. That sexual harrassment can only occur between individuals that work for the same company (this is mentioned nowhere), and 2. What compensation would be due to a MAN that had been unfairly accused (and perhaps disciplined or fired)of sexual harrassment. The authors, in their politically correct manner, go into depth on what would be due a WOMAN that had been sexually harassed.I was on the Amtrak on the way to work when I finished this book. .... More average, run of the mill books from polically correct newspaper columnists I don't need."
1,Only for first time managers,"I am always looking for good advice as a manager. This book is really intended for first time managers who do not have a clue about what it means to be a manager, either in the sense of how to manage or the legal issues involved. Having been a manager for some years I found not one single useful paragraph. It is all basic and not inspired at all. Bottom line: if you have never been a manager, it is not a bad handbook. If you have any real experience as a manager: save your money.... A better choice would be ""First..Break All the Rules"""
1,Politically correct garbage,"The Boss's Survival Guide adds nothing to the existing literature, demonstrates a nauseating politically correct viewpoint where only women can be harmed, and where information is actually clearly presented, is only useful for the neophyte manager who has been living in a vacuum all his life. I am sorry I wasted my money on this book. As I promised the author in an email, I threw the book into the nearest garbage truck."
5,Absolutely outstanding! What more can I say.,This is a must read for any manager or employee or anyone who knows a manager or employee.
2,Good for first time managers,"This is a very good book for first time managers and summarizes some common situations that managers face.It will not be as useful or insightful for experienced managers who have already run into these situations.The book tends to spend quite a bit of time on recruiting, interviewing, and hiring and probably not enough time on coaching, rewarding, and retaining top talent."
5,Human Resource Executives Should Buy This Book in Bulk,"I'm a consultant for one of the top management consulting firms and I help Silicon Valley and other high-tech firms with retaining high performers and improving organization performance.Many low performance issues can be traced back to ""boss"" performance. This book is a good way to improve manager or supervisor peformance, without putting them on the defensive.It's designed so that a boss can quickly choose the issue of concern (e.g., performance feedback, motivating people, required behavior changes, etc.). It's easy to use and does not require front-to-back reading.Leaders and Human Resource executives should buy this book in bulk to give to their team leaders. This book has already sold out its first printing, so I think others like it too.Let's improve company performance by improving boss performance!"
2,Maybe if your a Jane Powell or Arthur Treacher fan...,"I ordered this directly from Amazon and I was immediately disappointed. It came in a thin cheap case and appeared to be the same quality as the $1 DVDs you find in the deep discount stores. No menu, it just starts and is a poorly edited black and white film.This is advertised as Jane Powell's 2nd film. Her singing is wonderful and so her acting, except when she starts to cry. I also liked Ralph Bellamy, Arthur Treacher, and Ruth Tobey. The film has it's cute moments although the plot is thin. It's about a 15 year old girl in a boarding school that thinks that her older sister is a Broadway actress.I would recommend it to a Jane Powell or Arthur Treacher fan, but buy one of the cheaper dvds and save your money."
2,Pool Quality DVD,The movie is cute...long on singing short on plot. The problem is the poor quality of the DVD...it was not digitally enhanced and it was like watching an old newsreel...skipped and sputtered in spots and was painful to watch.
3,"Cute as a button, always","Just got this DVD from AMAZON today. The 18 year old Jane Powell was cute as a button (and now, at age 79, she's probably STILL cute as a button. The movie was nice, but Constance Moore -- who played Powell's sister in this movie -- was a little too old and a bit loose-skinned -- for a dancer. The price was low and Reel Enterprise -- who probably converted this to DVD probably did not have a good original. There was junk on the screem, vertical black lines and a constant RE watermark on the screen. Worth the cost? The movie: yes. The actual video: Probably. But's it's a keeper. One I will watch every year or so. Jane Powell has a beautiful voice and is easy to look at,ALWAYS. Cute as a button.Delightfully Dangerous"
5,Sensationally sexy!,Randy and Michael Brecker are extraordinary musicians who favorably omit the arrogance and pretentiousness of theory trained songwriting. I don't think any other cats can be THIS accessible!
5,It doesn't get any hotter than this,"M Detko is right on the money. ""Some Skunk Funk"" is one of the best jazz-rock tunes of all time. Michael Brecker's scorching solo on that song is mind-boggling. Bozzio never sounded better. This album was made at a time when creativity and complexity in music was not considered crime. If you find this disc anywhere, buy it!"
2,"A book that tries to be a classic western, but fails.","The book takes quite a wile to get going and then never really does. The synopsis for the book itself is also incorrect. Cain, the main character, isn't exciting or interesting in the least. A vengful killer does off some of his family members but he does nothing. The book is mainly about the Wyoming - Johnson County Range war - but unfortunately the book examines a very boring part of the war itself. I DO NOT advise anyone who enjoys a good western to read this book, they will be ultimately dissappointed."
3,Everybody's Weaving Book,This book has some good information for beginning weavers. The projects are fairly dated and some are pretty complicated to understand as written. Being an older book I think we've got newer ways of writing the patterns that make them easier to follow.
2,Bad conditions,"The cover is in bad condition, and some pages are as if they had water on it. Also, there is a ripped page.There are no highlights inside, though. At least.BUT I AM NOT BUYING WITH THIS SELLER AGAIN, unless they are able to make a better description of the state of the book."
5,GREAT MEN OF AMERICA AS HUMANS,I WON'T WASTE THE READER'S TIME PRAISING HOFFSTADTER--HE WAS ONE OF THE GREATS. THIS IS NOT A BOOK YOU WILL CUDDLE UP WITH ON A RAINY DAY. IT IS THOUGHT PROVOKING AND THOUGHTFUL. IT DELVES INTO STATESMEN OF ALL STRIPES AND DOESN'T MINCE WORDS FOR POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. THIS AUTHOR GIVES US A FRESH INSIGHT TO OUR HEROES AND MAY DISTURB US BY EXPOSING CLAY FEET THAT ARE NORMAL FOR ALL HUMANS GREAT AND AVERAGE. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN AMERICA'S PAST AND FUTURE READ THIS BOOK.
4,really informative,"It was pretty tedious to read, but there were many points well taken and it was overall a very good, informative book"
1,"It was very monotonous, and he was bias on his opinions","This book was very biased and did not tell the reader the whole concerning the actualities of the time...so I believe that this book does not deserve to ever be printed again...it just tells the autrocities that the people performed, so i dont think that this book was very good!"
2,"Nice features, too bad it didn't work","I bought this watch as a replacement for an older Timex that had similar features. I love the features -- both analog and digital, alarm, timer, Indiglo, multiple time zones (it says three but it really is one analog and two digital time zones). Unfortunately the rotating bezel did not work at all -- the numbers are there but it does not rotate at all. This was one of the reasons I bought this model.When it arrived, I started to set the time, alarm, etc. The buttons were slow to respond and then it started beeping continuously (like a loud alarm) and none of the buttons worked at all. I could not get it to stop making noise and it did so for almost an hour.Eventually it stopped making noise and seemed to begin working properly again. I had read the other negative review but dismissed it as a one-time defect. Now that it has happened to me and did so right out of the box, I do not recommend this watch."
2,Won't Last Long,"I bought this watch a little over a year ago. Yesterday it started ringing and found that the battery needed to be changed. Spent $7.25 to have battery changed, started ringing in less than an hour. Went back to battery store and found the watch had fried the battery and was junk. I no longer had the recipt for proof of purchase for any warranty. I expected the watch to last longer then this."
3,"For its time, 1960","It was a pretty good recording in the 60's, but since that time some have surpassed Casadesus. Roge and Tharaud to name 2 pianists. Read A music Fan/San Francisco/Jan 12,2004 for the best way to describe Casadesus style. Note perfect, but lacking the nuances needed to bring out the colors that Ravel so needs.Also Rouvier is stunning in performance, far surpassing Casadesus..But I'm afriad Cassadesus' popularity is living on old timers who just don't wish to change their high opinion of this past legend.TAKE NOTICE NONE OF THE HIGH PRAISE REVIEWS EVEN MENTION THAT THEY'VE HEARD ROGE, ROUVIER, THARUD.Go figure.Yet they claim this is the finest. Long live hype :-)TRhe ones who mark my comment as un-helpful are the die hard Casadesus fans. I've met a few."
4,Still a breath of fresh air to modern Lit,"Over all I believe this Novel was one step below Lord of the Barnyard, but the sole reason is the length of the book. If you liked Lord of the Barnyard then you will love this as well, you will also be let down with how short it is.Fortunately for Egolf fans that is the only flaw I really see in this book, I partially expected a sophomore slump, especially with the long wait for this release. But no, it held all the wit and humor that Barnyard held.With such mediocrity in lit now a days, I dearly hope egolf continues to write, and is right now hard at work for a third novel... I just hope it doesn't take 4 years for his next one."
2,He must have wrote this over a long weekend.,"I loved Lord of the Barnyard. This was not good, plain and simple. The chapters didn't connect with each other, therefore a coherent story was never formed. Another problem is that you never really care about the characters. The chapters are such ""skits"" that they never seem remotely real or compelling. Finally, there is zero follow-through in anything that occurs. Everything is what it is with no resonance or greater importance. I'm guessing his next book will be better."
3,What Happened to the Ending?,"I agree with the reader who thought the last chapter was missing. Chapters towards the end of the book where the alibis of all the characters are set forth at length could have been sacrificed to find Claire and Dan opening Christmas gifts and/or if the newlyweds enjoyed their honeymoon, etc. The first book of this series was excellent. Love Claire and Dan. Subsequent books seem to be going downhill."
3,Moderate Quality Compilation,"""The Greatest Western Movie Themes"" offers a good selection of tracks from some of the best western film scores. It suffers, however, from having all of these tracks played on a sythesizer. As a result, most of the musical reditions fall flat; they are pale imitations of themselves.That's not to say that this album is not enjoyable - it is. Unfortunately, it is also seriously flawed."
4,"Not the original artists, but enjoyable.","Some tracks are good copies of the orginal artists and some are not so good. Still, I enjoyed the tracks from the Dollar Trilogy Movies and Once Upon a Time In The West. For the real ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" buy the original sound track from the movie on CD."
5,I like it:),"This CD sounds great to me. I love the old spaghetti Western themes and I play this one in my CD player while I'm on the internet. It's great for the price. It has most of my favorites on one CD.The people ragging on this CD must be opera snobs or something. Music is music, and the tunes on the CD are well done. Of course I have the most eclectic taste in music of anyone I know. I'll probably be listening to Irish drinking songs next or Buddhist Chants:D"
2,covert operations,"I was disappointed with the cd. I was also disappointed with the fact that the samples of this cd did not match any of the songs on this cd. Almost to the point of being, shall I say ""deceptive""."
2,Nice looking but poorly designed,"The colors on this shape sorter are beautiful. The pieces and the box seem extremely durable too. The problem with this sorter is that several of the animals fit in holes other than those they belong in. For instance, the bird fits into the hole meant for the whale. Despite the poor design, my young son enjoys playing with this toy but it's definitely not a true shape sorter. It can probably be better used as a means to teach animals."
5,FUNNY Stuff,"If you like to laugh, and you enjoy raw, in-your-face comedy, you'll like STARVING ACTRESS. The Actors are in top form, and the writing is Blunt and true to Hollywood life! WELL DONE cast."
1,horrible,I was bored to the point of wanting to pull my eyeballs out and pierce my eardrums with searing hot pokers. The biggest waste of cash I ever spent. Sorry to the person who made it but it was the most awful short movie about nothing.
2,IT'S SPIRAL BOUND!!!,"I just got this ""book"" It's Spiral Bound! (I feel so stupid because Amazon says this right up there) 55 photo copied single sided pages. The content is interesting, but the price/value relationship? This is the text material from the author's comedy writing course."
2,"Qualcom Brew Platform-Yes, Help as a programming guide-No",This book covered the Qualcom Brew Platform very well and the sequence of steps it takes to develop apps for Qualcom phones very badly. The programming guides were not good enough to take a beginner to the development of even simple applications.The only positive thing this text did for me was to support the decision to recommend that my company pick another application development platform for their custom mobile apps. If someone wanted to create a development environment to discourage use--this is it!The book was well worth the money spent to assure me that this was where we didn't want to be. Sometimes knowing what NOT to do is every bit as important as knowing what to do.
3,Not as foolish as I thought,"PROs:- Zippy writing style- Nice, accelerating tension as the book progresses- I love the theme of first contact- Like the idea of a ship that has been traveling for centuries and that the crew doesn't know much about its origins and has become quasi-religiousCONS:- Bartolomeo, the protagonist, claims that many people don't like him. The book is told from the first person (I) perspective. However, Bartolomeo always treats everyone in a decent manner. Yes, he's deformed, but if he's a captain on a ship and treats everyone fairly, it's hard to believe that he is so disliked, even if he deformed. Either the author quit saying that Bartolomeo is disliked or he should have made him be more of a jerk.- So-so ending. I won't be a spoiler, but I would have liked a more satisfying ending.CONCLUSION: It's a good scifi book that I would recommend to many Sci-Fi nuts, but for those who are more picky, keep looking."
3,Almost excellant,"Russo can definitely write very well and create characters you care about and invest in. This books starts off at like a rocket then sort of coasts to a soft thud. the political infighting is well done, but the middle of the book needed to be chopped WAY DOWN. And the end needed to be enhanced. He should have given you a few chapters on the planet or maybe sequel to developing the planet. That would be something to look forward to, how they fail and/or succeed in deevloping a new society. I will definitely read more form this author and hope the next book is more balanced."
2,A dishonest book,"Do not let the excellent wtiting and character development fool you. This is a book that truly underestimates its audience. During the whole book, there are questions, mysteries, and plot that are never resolved. Instead, we are left to think that not all questions are answered in life and to enjoy a sense of mystery.The problem is that what is left unresolved is not trivial, but quite major and essential. So, I truly think that the author developed the questions, plot twists, and other unknown facts WITHOUT EVER INTENDING RESOLVE THEM.Instead, he opted to satisfy his readers with a movie ending.So, I repeat: the author himself does not know what motivated the aliens, the reasons for the preponderance of the Church, the history of the humans, or anything that he teased us with.He never intended to answer these questions, so he did not bother to answer them in writing or even in his own mind."
2,Leaves you hanging! Asks questions that never get answered.,"While I was initially intrigued by the premise behind this book---spaceship wandering aimlessly, with no ""memory"" of where it began, no purpose in its wandering---I was disappointed by the unanswered questions. So much more could have been revealed, which would have added a great deal of interest, not to mention satisfaction, in the last chapter. Who were the aliens? Why did they impale humans mercilessly? Why the elaborate ruse of the vessel if the goal was simply to murder humankind?This book was frustrating, to say the least. I don't recommend it unless the reader is accustomed to multiple unresolved issues."
1,Appalling,"The premise seemed good. The cover looked promising. However, this was one of the worst books I've read in years. I was shocked. It read like a direct-to-video movie. The characterization was unrealistic. Individual character traits, such as the deformities of the main character, were never explained nor added anything to the deapth of the character. There was absolutely NO explination for why the aliens would perform such savage acts on humans, why the humans let them do it, or how they went about performing said acts. There is likewise no explination of how the survivors plan on dealing with the consequences. The history of the ship is hinted at but never explored in any deapth. All in all, the book offers much promise, but delivers about as much as the average Schwarzenegger movie. I would not reccomend it to anyone."
2,Excellent writer - surprisingly incomplete book,"Pros:1) Russo is an excellent writer and very easy to read.2) He develops characters well3) He describes settings well4) He initiates a number of interesting conceptsCons:1) Ridiculously incomplete2) Virtually every important concept and event introduced was left underdeveloped and unexplainedBottom Line:If I had Russo's talent for writing, I'd be embarrassed to release such an incomplete work. Even if a sequel is on its way, this book left me feeling cheated. If he was a poor writer I could have dismissed the book shortly after picking it up, but because he has such obvious talent it was unexpected that he would fail to complete the many interesting concepts introduced."
2,aimless terror,"This is the story of a spaceship that travels through space for no discernible reason. It has a ruling class and a huge cathedral, a powerful Bishop and a hereditary captain. The latter is advised by the narrator of the story, a man born deformed who wears visible prosthesis. At some point, the ship encounters an alien vessel, and the last part of the book is taken up with efforts to explore the vessel... I won't spoil it for you.The book builds up a bit of suspense but in the end the let down is palpable: this is a book where nothing is explained. Instead the author relies on vagueness to build up suspense; on intimations, partial indications, incomplete answers. This would be fine if there was some kind of payout at the end of the tunnel, but there ain't one folks. As for the ending, I think the past decades since the book was written have not worn well on it because it just made me want to shrug and say, yeah, so?"
3,A Cosmic Letdown Of Stellar Proportions,"Richard Paul Russo is unquestionably one of our finest contemporary writers of science fiction. However, I wasn't satisfied with either the plot nor its end in his latest novel, ""Ship Of Fools"". Russo offers some tantalizing clues regarding a deserted human colony on the planet Antioch and the mysterious alien starship which may be related to the colony's sudden demise, but he doesn't quite pull all the pieces together. As the tale's narrator, Bartolomeo Aguilera is an intriguing character, along with others as diverse as the Argonos's captain and Father Veronica. Yet I didn't understand why Bartolomeo would risk sending the colonists aboard the starship Argonos to the planet Antioch towards the end of the tale. Still, this is an enjoyable reading experience graced with some of Russo's best prose."
4,Excellent hard science fiction,"I enjoyed Ship of Fools immensely. Russo crafts a believable 'generation ship' and then dives into the machinations of different political and religious factions on board. The story is told from the perspective of an unusual protagonist, which serves to highlight the tension and claustrophobia, especially once they make planetfall. The encounter with the alien ship is very well handled and original. Overall this book is a great read. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down."
2,fooled by the ship of fools,"I was fooled by the ""ship of fools"". I must say this is one of the weirdest books i've read, not because it has strange ideas - it hasn't - and not because of the plot - it doesn't exist - but because I've finished reading it and I asked myself what? What did Mr. Russo want to say? and if indeed want he did - where did it go wrong? The book is very readable, you can read it cover to cover in a couple of hours, but in the end, I'm sure you would wonder yourself: why? Reading it through I feel like opening layer after layer of gift-wrappings, only to discover there's no present inside. Very very disappointing."
1,execrable,"Intensely unsatisfying, Ship of Fools reads at it's most reductive level as a scattershot elision of Aliens and Event Horizon. You could call it plagiarism if it didn't plainly reek of creative bankruptcy. The theological investigations alluring to so many previous reviewers are pedantic, obvious, and naive. I'd label this a Christian attempt at scifi if I didn't hesitate to lambaste other far more insightful works with Russo's hackjob. If you long for the simplistic, crave neutered characterization, or disdain scifi then this's the one."
1,Stupidity abounds,"... I don't know. This book contained a lot of stupid rambling The plot could have been great but there were no explanations for a lot of things happening... blame it on aliens and just say since they are aliens, we are not going to understand the motives..."
1,Am I missing something...?,"Reading Russo's ""Ship of Fools"" is one of the most regrettable reading experiences I've had in years. This book reads like a novelization of some deservedly straight-to-video ""Aliens"" knock-off. The author tries to spook us, and subscribes heavily to the ""what you don't see is scarier than what you do"" school of the macabre.Unfortunately, Russo winds up showing the readers nothing of interest or originality, leaving us stranded aboard the dingy corridors of his fanciful generation ark hoping against hope that something interesting will happen.Be afraid. Be very afraid."
2,"Begins interesting enough, then falls appart","Begins with interesting characters and compelling intrigue. Ends a total mess. It had great potential, but the author just wasn't able to make anything of it."
3,who are the real fools ? the readers,"this book promise a lot - combination of horror and science fiction, but it miss both.what we have here is a plot about unknown aliens who are very soffisticate, and because of that, all they want to do is to ambush a 1000 years in space for human starships, and kill and torture all it's crew.the story hence is very unconvincing and not thrilling.because of that the end is very predictable, and disappointing."
5,Brush up on your French with this delightful book,French lovers everywhere get your copy of a great book that has been published in many languages throughout the world. This is the original French Version for those who wish to bone up on their French. We attended a play put on by the Drama Department at Thomas More College and were absolutely delighted with their production.of the play and story of the little prince. We have read it in English and now we are reading it in French to renew our language courses from years long ago. We recommend a copy of Barron's French Dictionary too for those words you need to look up. We should be ready to see Paris again too! Remember Amazon.com when you want to find what you are looking for.
4,Wowzah!,"I haven't read it yet but from what the illustrations say about the book, it looks very intriguing for an elementary book!"
5,We all need someone in our lives...,"""Draw me a sheep..."" the little prince asks the pilot. The pilot tries and finally draws the sheep...a box, the sheep is inside, he tells the prince. This book is so full of symbolism. Saint-Exupery wrote this book in a way that ideas could be conveyed to children while also educating the adults. He talks about the greedy man, the workaholic, the ""king"", and many other kinds of people. He also talks about that important person in our lives, the ROSE, who is like the rest of us, but to us, that person is unique. This book is for the whole family...teaching each of us a little something."
4,"Surprising, Surpassing and Refreshing!","At first I wasn't crazy about the book. I first read Le Petit Prince in my Grade 12 French class. I thought it was going to be a little silly story. Well, I learned 2 lessons--don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a book until you have finished reading it! I found that this story, with its silly characters and planets, held a deep message that not even a highly philosophical book could express. The story is a refreshing change--one with characteristics of a children's story and yet one with a serious message for ""les grandes personnes""! It really grew on me! So I encourage you, when reading the book to: sit back and relax, rediscover your imagination and learn a lesson or two!!!"
3,Beaucoup de fautes,"Bien sur l'histoire elle mme est magnifique, mais j'ai été bien déu par cette édition bourrée de fautes de frappe. Est-ce que Amazon n'a pas de correcteurs francophones?"
4,A French Language Classic,I love this book and story. It is certainly geared for the young and the older person as well yet told by an amazing author. The story is delightful and presents many unique scenarios from a child's point of view. It is a story of exploration and discovery. There are many lessons to be learned and morals to be valued. The story is also accompanied by child like drawings which almost transform the reader intoeach magical realm of discovery.
1,A book about a nutcase who hallucinates about another nut,"...This Book is about a nutcase who draws snakes with elephants inside and becomes a pilot because the "" grandes personnes "" wanted him to stop drawing nonsense and become something useful. Anyhow, he crashes and hallucinates about this stupid little kid who calls himself ""le Petit Prince"" who lives all alone on a planet the size of a table. One day, a talking flower comes along and makes him depressed so he somehow magically goes to see other planets and ends up on earth where he meets a talking fox and Antoine de Saint-Exupere. He then regrets leaving his planet and tells a talking snake to kill him so he can "" return to his planet"". So now, after reading my review you see what a waste of valuable time this book is."
5,Tres Bon!!!,"Je suis une etudiante Americaine qui etudie la Francaise a mon ecole. Nous avons lu ce livre l'annee derniere, et je l'aime!!! C'etait nos devoirs pendant quelques semaines, et je pense que ce livre est un tres bon method pour apprendre la langue Francaise!* * * * *I'm an american student who's studying french at my school. We read this book last year, and I love it!!! It was our homework for several weeks, and I think this book is a great way to learn French!"
1,CD does NOT come with book,"The book itself is beautiful, and you're willing to pay the price because of the audio CD purportedly included; forget it, then, because i've ordered the book twice, had it delivered twice, and neither delivery included the promised audio CD. Buyer beware."
3,It's okay.,"I bought this as a long-time fan of the novel and as a student of French. The text is perfectly fine, but unfortunately the illustrations included in the Kindle version I have are very small and poorly formatted. I bought an official Kindle copy to avoid this very problem, thinking the publisher would have made sure that the novel would be formatted the best possible way for Kindle readers. So, for me, this was a disappointing buy. Still, this is a fantastic book, and reading the original French text (if you happen to be a non-French speaker) is well worth it every time."
4,En franais c'est merveilleux,"Bought this because our professor of French specified this edition for use in her class. Our ongoing assignment:make note of all words we looked up in the bilingual sources (online or text);note each word whose sound or appearance intrigued or charmed us;note those words or phrases which to us seemed poetic.So far (chapter 4) in my collection are dozens of the first, a handful of the second, but none of the third (je regrette, madame: je ne suis pas un poète. M. Villon bien sr, moi jamais).But we are only starting!"
2,This book is not using my default French Dictionary,"This looks like a wonderful Kindle edition with illustrations. However, in my Kindle Touch it does not use my default French dictionary which is the Wiktionnaire du Franais pour Kindle. When I highlight a word the Kindle brings up the Barron's French English Dictionary which is not my default French Dictionary. I tried Archiving the Barron's dictionary and now my Kindle brings up the Oxford Dictionary of English. All my other French edition books work fine."
2,Antichildren's Book,"I love the fantasy and the art work that is in this book. What bothers me is that this ""children's"" book uses suicide as an answer to the main character's problem. I can't help but wonder what negative connotations this sends a child before they reach the turbulent teen years."
1,Dictionary Problems,"This version did not work with my Mirriam-Webster's French-English dictionary on my kindle. The version published Jan 3, 2011 and currently selling for 3c more than this version does work with the dictionary, and it too has illustrations. If you are not fluent in French, buy that version instead."
3,Larger words would help!,"Good book of peoms, but the print is way too small for older people, even with reading glasses."
4,still able to make good discs at this point.,"Thin lizzy was about to head down. Phil lynotts drug problems would destroy this band and take his life in 1986. drugs suck , what else can you say? but in 1980 this one came charging out with some really great tunes. I couldn't have guessed how phil was blowing it at this point. Song's like 'killer on the loose' are still played by thin lizzy today! 'chinatown' was prime hard rock too. Some songs are not as great but overall this was a strong effort , even if you could see the cracks starting to come to foreground."
4,Solid cd from thin lizzy,"This is another very good cd from thin lizzy. My favorites on it are We will be strong, Chinatown, Sweethart( great production in sound achieved on this tune), and having a good time. all the songs are good on here. It rates about mid-of the pack as far as lizzy cd's go."
4,Very Cute,"Even though this animated alligator only sings one song. I bought it for a young child who loved it. It is fairly large, seems as well made as other animated toys (maybe even a little better) and was reasonably priced."
2,DOES NOT INCLUDE THE AXE,"I ordered this for my son for Halloween - it's a standard, inexpensive costume, but it does not come with the axe in the picture - very dissappointing, especially since it's only 5 days until Halloween!"
3,Outfit was true to size EXCEPT the hood :(,I ordered the Med for my 6 year old. Everything fit except the hood! The hood looks like it might fit with a 2T costume.It doesnt even cover his mask while he is wearing.Not Happy :(
5,Scary and made in USA?,"(Size: Med) The mask itself is of a pretty nice plastic with an elastic strap and Velcro on the ends to secure it to your head.. hard to say how long these straps will last but for sure they will last one night! The facial features actually are pretty scary... a super cool skeleton!I was pretty surprised to see a made in USA label on the gown! It indicates it is made by ""Rubie's""However the mask does say made in China.For a kids costume it seems like something affordable, durable?, scary, and cool!Contents: Skeleton (printed) gloves, black hood, black gown with ""waist sash"" belt, and mask.Also, another reviewer commented on the hood not fitting. I am old-ish and could ALMOST make the hood fit on my head even though this is a kids costume."
3,The good and the bad.,"The toy basically doesn't work very well at least how it's suppose to, and it's very loud. My 2 year old just plays with the bike, and right now it's one of his main toys. So to me the toy sucks, but my kid likes it...so?? I guess it's worth the purchase, but all the plastic pieces are not worth keeping. Just the bike, evil, and the wind up thing."
4,It's like I'm 8 yo again,"I had these stunt cycles when I was growing up, and was very upset when I found my mother had thrown them away while I was at college. But this is appears to be even a better product then those. A little bit louder than I rememeber, but who knows; and who cares. I love it as much as the dog hates it."
3,Not the highest marks,"I bought this CD knowing what I was getting into - and that was for Comatose [Re-Entry-Mix] and Electrocution [Shocker Mix] - both on disc #1. There are a couple or three other mixes that are alright, but the collection as a whole doesn't match up to the album versions, and the remixes are trying too hard to sound like remixes. The drums, and the TB-303 bass lines are just a little too prevalent on most of the tracks (I much prefer the 2600 bass lines). And just for the record, I'm a pretty big fan of FLAvour of the Week.If you don't have FLAvour of the week, I recommend you buy that first...and if you really dig it and just have to have more, then buy Re-Wind second - or skip it and move onto Epitaph and/or Implode which are both excellent!"
4,More FLA Remixes,"This 2 CD Remix Digipack from FLA named 'Re-Wind' is a must for any fan of FLA. Disc 1 is mixed by FLA (Leeb, Peterson & Fulber) and Disc 2 is mixed by 7 different artists like Front 242, Collide, Kalte Forben, Eat Static, Cydonia and Fini Tribe who remix FLA songs from the 'Flavor Of The Weak' album. Disc 2 is the highlight with the different styles of songs from all 7 different artists putting their interpretations and representations to FLA songs. On Disc 2 the best three songs that I thoroughly enjoyed were 'Comatose', 'Predator Remix' and 'Colombian Necktie'. All three remixes were craftily done and will suite many varied tastes.However the artwork of this album leaves alot to be asked. It doesn't look good, isn't appealing nor fits into the album at all. Information of the album was lacking and I could see that no foresight was put into this cover. Hence only 4 stars."
2,"Squawking, Dissonant, Experimental Noise","If you love the Soft Machine-era Canterbury (also Daevid Allen's Gong) or current RIO (Rock In Opposition) progressive, then this CD might appeal to you. To me, it sounds extremely dated and I find it very difficult to listen to even after several attempts. The saxophone is irritating and the music seems uinspired, off-the-cuff, improvisational floundering that at times is as musical as fingernails running across a chalkboard. The musicianship of the combined talent here should have come-up with something better than this...squawking, experimental noise."
1,disappointed,I have to say when I read this I was very disappointed in it. It was such a slow read and the author had trouble holding my attention. A very very dull read. Not really anything new that we didn't already know about Bob Hope from Bob Hope all these years. I expected more from the author. Don't waste your time or money I'm sorry to say.
4,An enjoyable read,I found this book to be an enjoyable read. All those years of watching Bob Hope make it all look so easy - now I realize how hard he worked to become an amazing entertainer.
1,An appalling book,"This is an incoherent, jargon-laden tract which purports to show that Virginia Woolf was not manic depressive and that her husband Leonard Woolf, who lovingly protected and nurtured his difficult wife for thirty years, was a monstrous specimen of the patriarchy, etc. etc. who, in effect, facilitated her murder. Irene Coates is no more capable of analyzing Virginia Woolf than spelling her name, her ignorance of basic information is stunning, is and Soho Press, whatever that is, should be sanctioned for publishing this mountain of drivel."
5,Classic!,"This is one of the two classic bullfight albums(now cd) to own. Pasodobles Con El Mejor Mariachi Del Mundo, would be my other recommendation. There are other good ones, but I would start with these two. Ole!"
4,Andromeda - self-titled (Green Tree) 4 1/2 stars,"Basically, this is the exact same track listing as disc one of the Andromeda-'Definitive Collection' 2-CD (see my review)that the Angel Air label had released a few years later. Clearly, one of the outstanding pre-Atomic Rooster works by guitarist, composer and vocalist John DuCann. Must-have British late '60's psych."
3,"Shows the talents of the sound crew, but not the band.","If you want to be wowed by your home theater's sound abilities, check this one out and play it LOUD! Sub-woofer required. Don't bother with it, though, if you only have a mono TV with VHS. While the sound QUALITY is great, the band's performance (read: vocals) is terrible. We've all witnessed Hetfield's voice being reduced from a great roar to a pathetic yelp in recent years. Cunning Stunts shows him at a new low: Yelping off key! Really, any drunk at a karoke bar could sing Hero of the Day better than this. They need a new singer. What a shame, too, because the rest of the band is so ""on"". I deducted one star for this. The second star deducted was for the boring set-list. Aside from an early version of Fuel, this is the same old stuff Metallica fans have already heard too many times. How about Phantom Lord or Escape... and SING IT RIGHT!"
5,Fantastic,This DVD is awesome. Metallica is a true in your face live band. The only thing better is seeing them live. Metallica gets better with age.Metallica is one hell of a monster in heavy metal.
4,"Metallica's latest is quite a nice marketing ""Stunt""","While I generally loathe live music concerts captured on video, this particular endeavor from the ever famous San Francisco quartet delivers more than expected. Being the consumate 'Tallica Head that I am, my opinion is biased, however, this DVD is almost perfect. The sound is incredible in digital stereo, the picture is sharper than anything you will see on VHS, and the flexibility of the DVD media allows you to stop or start the concert at any point you wish. The only complaint I have is that the touted ""extra features"" were not quite ""extra"" in Metallica Terms. This DVD would probably have been much better if it wasn't being rushed for the Holidays. Less emphasis on proper marketing, and more emphasis on quality is not something one expects from Metallica, but this DVD does show some evidence of corporate greed."
5,DVD or VHS. Hell it is Metallica they both rule.,Ok metallica is by far the best band in the world. I own the DVD and VHS of Cunning Stunts. If you just have a VCR get the VHS cause well it is metallica and they are good on any format. The VHS edition is just the concert on the tape. It is a superb concert and sounds excellent on the stereo. If you have a DVD player and have not gotten the DVD edition. DO SO. It has the superb concert that is shown on the VHS tape and they threw in alot of bells and whistles like behind the scenes and different angles so you can watch any of the bandmembers you want for the whole song. (This is only on 3 songs probably due to the large amount of DVDs required to do all songs) Either way get one or the other dammit!
5,Best Buy,"This dvd set is the best one i have yet. For the money you get a load of extras ,great sound and great video. It is Metallica at there best , and if you are a Metallica fan you should own this dvd."
2,"sad, embarrassing","I went to a Metallica concert back in the early 90s when they were at their zenith. It was the best concert I've ever been to. The energy of the band was directed straight into the mosh pit. Fast no nonsense metal from start to finish.In 'Cunning Stunts' they tried a new arrangement with a multifaceted stage and various gimmicks, but I just don't think it worked. The crowd was all patchy and most of the kids just weren't into it (I mean at the concert I went to back in the 90s there were riot police outside - yes, real RIOT police! With armoured trucks! No kidding).Cunning stunts was just embarrassing. Not convincing somehow. Sorry. They just seem so lame.I give 2 stars because Kurt can still solo. How about some shredding on the next album guys?"
5,DVD killer app!,"This is what concerts on DVD should be like! Once other bands take a look at this, hopefully they'll know what to do.Not a Metallica fan? Get it anyway, period."
3,Disappointing performance...,"I went to a show on the Load tour, and I can surely say that the show I saw was 20 times better than this!!!! Anybody looking for great Metallica videos, check out the Live Shit series or Cliff 'em all...but what is this?...the first half of the video has Metallica doing half-assed jobs on some of their best songs...Sad But True is awful, Creeping Death James sings the chorus in a MAJOR key instead of minor like it's written, and 2 of the solos to ""One"" are screwed up by Kirk. But not only that, there is no fire in the band...not until the second half of the video...They rip in the second half of the video, esp[ecially on the ""kill/ride"" medley, NOthing Else Matters, Master of Puppets, Last Caress, Am I Evil, and many more.....But overall, this isn't one of their better efforts..."
4,Cunning Stunts - Unsynchronized Metal,"The first thing I realized when I put the DVD in my DVD-player was that the guys who syncronized this disc must have been either drunk or lazy. I can't count how many times Lars hit the drums and the sound comes a second later. Kirk and James seems to be playing a different song than the one coming out if my speakers... Away from that, this DVD was the best thing I've ever bought. Jaymz, Kirk, Jazn and Lars really kicks Fort Worths a**! Lars seems like he has been playing them drums since he was born. And i bet Kirk sat in Mexico when he was eight an played...solos on his guitar while he drank tequila. Cause this is the best live-performance I've ever seen. Nothing beats it. Buy it. Become on of us"
5,Awesome,This is an awesome DVD. It had me wishing I was there. I can't wait for Metallica to come to concert. I only hope it is half as good as cunning stunts.
2,Did Metallica choke?,"Metallica did this specific show to film for a video, so did they choke or what? Most of the renditions on this video are lackluster and butchered. And what the is the deal with them only play two and a half minutes of ""Master of Puppets"". The band does do better on the second have of the show, but 50%, even 60% effort is unacceptable, especially for a video.Pros: The second half of the show is much better than the first. It is still Metallica live.Cons: They sure did choke or something because some of the songs are brutal and almost painful to watch.Final Thoughts: Save your money and buy ""Live Sh*t Binge and Purge"" or ""Cliff 'Em All"", both of which feature far better performances unless you need to have all of Metallica's videos."
5,Wow!,"This is an amazing live DVD. I have noticed a lot of people commenting on how bad James' voice sounds. If you want a studio sound, go listen to the studio album. This is Metallica in the raw, so get over it! I will admit however that his vocals on S&M; were much better, but it doesn't really make that big of a difference.Being a huge Metallica fan, and having been to a lot of shows, it was nice to see them open the show with a different format than ""Ecstasy of Gold."" The Jam on ""Bad Seed"" was a nice opener. Jason's bass solo was awesome, and I am suprised that this wasn't turned into a song at some point.Great DVD. Highly recommended!"
5,Another killer live DVD set from Metallica!!!!!,"""CUNNING STUNTS"" was the first concert video filmed with the DVD format in mind, and it looks that way, too: great sound and picture, alternate camera angles and loads of special features. Only flaws: splitting the show onto two discs instead of putting the whole show on one (like the VHS version) and not including the video clips from LOAD, RELOAD and GARAGE INC. with the special features. Other than that, a killer concert from Metallica!!!!!"
5,The BADDEST concert around!,"The true quality and head-bangin' ability of Metallica show through on this packed-to-the-gills DVD! Everything is here: backstage, pictures, roadies, multiple angles on 3 songs. The audio quality is the best, I have friends who don't even like Metallica and they like the wall shaking, ear piercing power of Metallica on this DVD. My only complaint (and it is a minor one) is that it's hard to the crowd when James asks them to sing a verse. Well worth the price. Even if you only have 1 Metallica CD, you should get this. I went out and bought the 5 Metallica albums that I didn't have after watching and listening to this concert."
5,The Best DVD concert to date!,"Metallica sets the standard for all the others! Outstanding camera work, outstanding sound quality and of course an outstanding performance by the group. Best DVD I have purchased to date. Not a Metallica fan? This DVD may change your mind."
5,totally amazing.,"When I first bought this I was a little skeptical. I was blown away with the 5.1 dobly digital sound, the energy the band gave off, and the set list. Kirk Hammet was flawless, Lars was came with so much power, even though I don't like him anymore, Jason Newstead played a major role, and James of course left the crowd screaming for more and more. I would recommend this to any Metallica fan."
1,Embarrassing,"Metallica is great, this product displays them at their near worst. Pandering to the crowd, playing with the lights on for the first few songs, asking if the crowd wants ""heavy"". Give me a break. Metallica never needed to do anything but go up on stage and crank the stuff out, so why they resorted to these tactics I don't know. Other than they are playing to the cameras, which every band does, but this is a little out of character. I don't understand the glowing reviews here. I frankly feel the audience got shortchanged and didn't experience a true Metalli-show where it's all black, all music, all fist pumping, all the time. And the stupid camera-angle-change feature of my DVD didn't work. More marketing to the masses I suppose."
2,Binge and Purge Seattle Show is MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all, I love 80's Metallica and thats why i gave the low rating. If you like 90's Metallica, you'll love this. If you're into 80's Metallica only, stay far, far away! Audio/Video sounds and looks great on ""Cunning Stunts"". Check out Binge and Purge Live in Seattle 89. Blows this away!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Displays the talents of the Production Crew... Not the band.,"Looks and sounds terrific. I always use this DVD to show-off my sound system to friends. Sadly, it doesn't show-off Metallica as a competent band. Hetfield's voice is so far off-the-mark that it is, for the most part, unlistenable as music. The band looks really bored and tired. And the energy drops even more every time they pause between songs for a lazy call-and-response routine. In conclusion: if you have all your speakers and a good subwoofer and want to be wowed by big explosions, this rocks. If you want to hear Metallica play with conviction, buy the earlier video ""Live Sh-t: Binge & Purge"""
2,Exceptional quality but not what they used to be.,"Having been a huge Metallica fan for almost half of my 34 years, it was no surprise to me that I would plunk down $30 for this DVD. New video technology, excellent sound, etc. were all reasons to buy this. The quality of this video is exceptional. Great camera work, sound, lighting. It was all great. But Metallica has lost the edge they used to have. Hearing James Hetfield straining on vocals, I couldn't sit through this video. Although the musicianship is still top-notch, they sound to me like a very tired band. The newer material is also not my cup of tea and to have only a medley of the killer old stuff, it just didn't do it for me. I own almost everything Metallica ever put out, cd's and videos, but had to draw the line on Re-Load. I may pick it up at a second-hand cd store sometime. Kirk Hammett remains the best guitarist in the world as does Lars Ulrich on drums. Diehard Metallica fans-buy this DVD. Those old timers-spend your money elsewhere."
3,Not bad...,"I saw most of this performance on VH1 last month. At the time, I had never seen a live Metallica performance before. I read the reviews for both Cunning Stunts and S&M. At the time I thought that some reviewers were over-exagerating the quality of James Shetfield's vocals. However, having recently bought S&M, I can both see and hear the difference. In Cunning Stunts, he is odviously straining on some of Metallica's older material. I'm also reasonably sure he does the ""call and reply"" routine on the parts of songs he couldn't do anymore. I don't know what he did with himself, but two years later in S&M James is back. He can actually hit the correct notes, and just doesn't sound as tired and worn out as he did on Cunning Stunts.I gave this DVD three stars because, hey, it's Metallica. They'll always be cool live. Any other band would have gotten a two or a one from me. But not Metallica."
4,Very good for the money,"We were really expecting a piece of junk, but pleasantly surprised by this item. It works well, especially the detector. It spins a little slow and in daylight you can forget about seeing the laser light (but it does come with the detector, so it's not a big deal.) Also it's a little bit of a pain to use it for corners, you have to mount it on it's side. HOWEVER for a squaring laser, you can't get anything near this price and it did the job it was bought for, so we are happy with it and would recommend it."
4,superb film yet it lacks something,"THe film was very enjoyable to watch. The cast were outstanding especially doughlas and downey jr and was directed with pure excellence. Yet the plot does contain quite a few holes, leaving questions to be asked at the end of the film. It will not be for everybodys taste but if you apreciate true film-making and great acting then do watch this.Butin terms of buying it,i wouldn.t as its not the type of film you watch over and over."
4,Mine's Edited For Content,"Why is there a title just before the movie begins that says that the film has been edited for *content*? Has it really? If there is some difference between the video version and that which was on the ""big screen,"" I'd like to know what it is.In very small print on the DVD case, it does say, ""Video version."" What is this?Just a head's up. Other than this little mystery, the DVD production was handled quite nicely, with handsome menus and fantastic sound."
2,Wondering Boys ?,"My initial reaction after watching this movie was ""Huh?"" This movie has very little in the way of a followable plot-line. Arguably the worst movie I've ever seen, this film was definitely a step- down for the likes of Micheal Douglas. Not recommended."
2,FLACCID FUN,"Critically acclaimed at its time of release, I can't find myself jumping on the bandwagon for this one. WONDER BOYS features some really good performances from Michael Douglas as a washed out professor whose tribulations on a certain weekend would be more than enough to vanquish any male; Frances McDormand as the college chancellor and lover--and wife of his boss (a subdued and underused Richard Thomas); Tobey Maguire as a rather glum young wannabe writer with worlds of talent; Robert Downey Jr. as a homosexual editor who sets his sights on Maguire; and even Katie Holmes as one of Douglas' students who offers him solace. The whole thing is so laid back, though, and its points of conflict seemingly forced that I couldn't get involved in spite of the acting. WONDER BOYS just didn't fill me with any kind of wonder at all."
1,"The music is great, and I love Robert Downey, Jr., but .....","I rented this movie because I have the CD and the music is great! However, the movie was so boring that I couldn't get through it (and I had a 5-day rental)."
5,Wonder Boys,"An incredible movie that should have done exponentially better at the box office. Intelligent funny and memorable .... this movie has it all. Buy it, you'll be happy you did.... trust me!"
4,What movies should aspire to be,"Excellent writing, great direction and exceptional acting. A wonderful, entertaining movie that kept me guessing and laughing througout. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would from the previews. Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire were fun to watch. I just might have to buy this one to keep!"
4,Quirky but good,"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.Wonderboys will especially be appreciated by anyone who is a writer. The film will leave you with a thoughtful smile."
3,Probably better not to read the book first,"Well, this is a very enjoyable film, but when you get home you'll start picking holes in it.The biggest hole by far is Michael Douglas. Having read the book, to me he plays the character of Grady all wrong. He's too ""Michael Douglas"" for a start, overdoes the cute comedy act, looks just too unappealing for us to believe that the Chancellor could be interested in him.And there are clumsy moments, like when the book falls out of the car, and scenes that are electrifying in the novel and thrown away in the film. They even missed out one of the best sequences...Robert Downey Jr is excellent though, and the interplay between him and the James Leer character is very well done. And the Pittsburgh backdrop is atmospheric and a bit different.Just about worth it."
4,Great Movie,"This is a smart, funny movie and some of Michael Douglas's best work in recent history. Toby McGuare rounds out a great cast. If your looking for a witty, sharp movie this one is for you. Don't pass it by"
2,GREAT PERFORMANCES BUT ....,"Michael Douglas astonished me. He's perfect here as the professor. But why on Earth the history had the show the outcast brilliant student ( Tobey MAcGuire ) being gay alongside RObert Downey's character ???!! THe scene where they appear together in bed was so unecessary and bad tasted, I almost puked !! I'm not being moralist, I just think that Downey's character ( the editor ) being gay was enough. Other than this, the movie sometimes is very, very, very slow...."
2,What a waste of a good cast.,"This movie has the makings of something special - good actors, interesting plot, but the way it was made just makes it boring. I ended up not caring about any of the characters which is fine because nothing really happens to any of them. A resolution to one problem at the end was nice, but otherwise this movie was a tease of what it should have been. Don't blink or you might miss the adorable Katie Holmes."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie that seemed to me weird for the sake of being weird (Tobey Maguire's shooting the dog seems to come out of a Farrelly Brothers movie), Wonder Boys features an enjoyable performance by Michael Douglas but it's long and winding and slow and not nearly as clever as it thinks it is."
3,The Story Kills Itself,"I looked very much forward to this movie, since my local cinema magazine called it Michael Douglas' best role ever, and because I enjoyed Tobey Maguire's part in Pleasantville.But I was disappointed. Wonder Boys is a movie trying to paint a portrait of an author who is sinking deeper and deeper into the swamp that the success of a book of his, and he himself, have created. But the movie never really finds its own story. It sorts of wanders around in unfinished sideplots and kliché-marked details.It's a pity. Still, there are some pretty good jokes in Wonder Boys, and if you have nothing better to do on a Sunday, it won't be a waste of time to go see it."
2,YOU MUST BE JOKING,"Anyone who said that Tobey MAcGuire acting in this movie was great must be joking !! He's atrocious here, ruining the whole picture. Anyway, we don't care at all at the characters of this movie, so shallow they are. It never explains the trouble with James Leer's (MacGuire ) parents, nor why he is a future gay, only waiting for some smart gay ( Downey's character ) to seduce him and lead him to the ""EVIL WAYS"" ... The appearance of Vernon is a shameful attempt to twist the plot in a comical way, but it fails miserably. All in all, Hanson dropped the ball here. I agree the movie is different from Hollywood clichs, and this is good. Douglas performance is outstanding. Along the middle, the movie already made the audinece lose all attention on it."
2,ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!,"I have heard how wonderful Wonder Boys is and how it has been unjustly ignored by the Oscar voters this year. So I rented it and have to say that there really isn't anything special here. In fact, I ended up watching it in three different sessions as I fell asleep during the first two portions that I watched. That says something on its own.I think that Curtis Hanson was trying to make an intellectual slapstick comedy when he made Wonder Boys. But that combination just doesn't work here as the disasters faced by the main characters aren't very funny. I thought that the only performance worth talking about was that of Poe, the blind dog who meets an unfortunate end. With a great cast of actors who I have enjoyed in other flicks, it just didn't do it for me."
4,"""I... am a writer!""","Man, I hated that guy the second he got to the podium and said that!A friend of mine lent me his copy of ""Wonder Boys"" a few years back. This is the book, mind you. I loved the book, so I was interested in seeing the movie when it came out... but I never did. I actually had to borrow the DVD from the same guy who lent me the book in the first place!I was worried that the movie would really deviate from the book and try to sensationalize the murders (the dog... the snake). However, though the snake was omitted, they did not. In fact, aside from the whole story with the auto and the trip up north to his in-laws' house, the movie is pretty accurate to the book. I like how the movie was paced as well. Despite all the zannyness of the book, the film and the actions of the actors came off to me as realistic.Also, I'm glad they shot on location in Pittsburgh. I would hate to see a movie about Pittsburgh (where I'm living now) and it be filmed in Toronto or Indianapolis..."
5,Funny and entertaining.,"This is my favorite Michael Douglas film, based on a novel, great script, funny, and delightful romp through a day in the life of a popular college professor who has writer's block. A must see."
5,Wonder Boys,This is one of my favorite movies. These are the best characters I've ever seen Michael Douglas and Toby Maguire play. It's a little dreary but hilarious. Excellent characters and good cinematography.
2,who cares ......,"this movie was below ho-hum. tobey maguire easily gives his most annoying performance. i disliked michael douglas' character. and i really had no interest in this movie. however i'm giving this movie two stars instead of one because it wasn't as long as *the green mile* and *magnolia*. if *wonder boys* had droned on for another hour, then i'm sure i would have hated it as much as those other two pathetic films. as it is, this was only two hour of maudlin liberal tripe."
1,As Bad as it Gets,"You know a film is bad when you can't wait for it to end, and that's exactly what was happening as I watched Wonder Boys. Yes, it has a superb cast, but that's the only high point. The rest of the movie was a mash of horrible plots, bad scripting, and redundant scenery. Maybe my expectations for this movie were too high. Maybe after hearing how great this film was, I had expectations that the film could never meet. I'm not sure why I hated this movie so much, other than it moved me only to boredom. It lacked inspiration, it lacked hope, it lacked the reasons why I watch films in the first place. Maybe it's just me, but my recomendation is to avoid this film, unless you enjoy being uninspired."
1,Pulp,"Shallow and contrived. Like it was made with a formula.Stories about writers, especially writers with writer's-block, should be outlawed - First Amendment rights or not. Tedious and self indulgent.The only good thing about the film is Bob Dylan's ""Things Have Changed"" that plays during the begining and ending credits."
1,This is a really bad movie; no refunds given at the door.,"Curtis Hanson has made some very good movies(Bad Influence, LA Confidential, even Losin' It was cool), but this movie suffers from some kind of false scholastic irony and deadpan baby boomer humor that thinks can substitute for an entertaining story.Michael Douglas plays a loser. Tobey Maguire doesn't convince me that he is a genius underneath a loser exterior. And the absurd plot and weak relationships give the audience 120 minutes with no where to go.It is all a shame. This movie bombed for good reason."
4,"Very good, funny film","This has probably been said of every performer in nearly every movie they ever made, but, seriously, this is probably Michael Douglas's best performance to date. Yes, yes, Traffic and Wall Street are each close seconds. Toby Maguire departs from his usual, likeable, huggable kind of character in favor of a likeable but oddball kinda guy. Katie Holmes is better than her personal average in her role. Frances McDormand is about on par with her other roles (which is rather good). If you like strong plot elements, this movie will probably disappoint you. There are a few things that get started early on, but they're mainly just excuses for the characters to interact. I love this kind of character-driven movie, so I think it's great."
5,Tobey Rocks.,"""Wonder Boys"" is ranked number 4 in my top 10 movies of all time. ""Pleasantville"" and ""Cider House Rules"" are ranked high on this list too. Does anyone see a connection between the three? Tobey Maguire! Tobey is the best young actor that has shown up in a very long time. Something about the way he portrays his characters is astounding and very convincing. Same goes in this movie. His portrayal of James Leer is hillarious and depressing and sad at the same time. You really feel sorry for him.Michael Douglas, who I have never liked, makes a surprising performance. He is very funny, and movie in his protral of Tripp. Robert Downey Jr is HILLARIOUS. Nothing more can be said about him. HILLARIOUS. The rest of the cast is great too.This movie has everything--friendship, heartbreak, unexpected pregnancy, great acting, great plot, and a dead dog. What more can you ask for? Please go see it. It is a wonderful movie. Oh yea--One more thing--Tobey Maguire Rocks!!!"
4,If you're from Pittsburgh you're really gonna like this movie.,Michael Douglas portrayal of Professor Grady Tripp is Oscar worthy. The misadventures that happen to him throughout the movie from trying to figure out what to do with the dead dog in his trunk to kidnapping one of his students are pretty funny. Plus the movie was filmed on location in Pittsburgh and it rained a lot which enhanced the mood of the film.
5,Compelling and touching comedy.,"This is probably the best performance I have ever seeen by Michael Douglas. He is so convincing in this role that that if I see him in another movie, its not even like the same person.This is a brilliant and charming film. It is beautifully directed and fast paced. The characters are interesting and in the end, I still wanted more from them.This film is not for everyone though. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys the work of Woody Allen, not to someone who enjoys the ""American Pie"" movies.Excellent soundtrack filled with good selections from Bob Dylan's library of classics.Highly recommended."
3,I tried two different products and this one wasn't as good,"I tried this and the CD Stripper and ultimately had to go with the CD Stripper, even though it is marketed ONLY to opening CDs. Why? Because it is sturdier, stronger and truly easy to use. It is also more attractive and both kids and adults love it. Finally, it has the same advantages of being child-proof AND not easily broken by children. My kids broke the CD/DVD opener on this page. So I'm going with the CD Stripper."
4,simply works,"Product seems to work pretty well. Only one thing, you must get it positioned right on the edge of the CD."
4,Handy Device,"Worth the money - however, watch out for the shipping cost - it is 4 times the price of the product itself."
2,DVD and CD Opener,This item was a great idea but very quickly wore out. I would NOT suggest this item to a friend. Better off using a pair of scissors to open the movies the old fashioned way.
2,low battery,"It works like a music box--when you open it, the music sounds. But it only runs for several minutes and there seems to be a battery failure, but I cannot find the openging for battery replacement, so my daughter just use it as a ""jewelry box""."
2,This came up when searching for a new one!,"My children have had these jewelry boxes for about 2 years. The ballerina broke within the first year. I am shopping for new ones right now, and thought I would let others know in case you are considering these. They might be OK for older children - but my kids were about 4 and 2 when they received these."
3,Pretty but you get what you pay for,Got this for my daughters and after a few weeks of constant winding the key would crank and then spin out quickly. I carefully dismantled the jewelery box to look into it and found that the plastic gearbox case had split wide open making it unfixable.
3,Just OKay Jewelry Box,"When I received and opened this jewelry box...it did NOT look like the picture shown...it does NOT have a ""heart"" shaped mirror inside, very misleading. But I had no time to return it, as it was a gift and I had to get it wrapped & given quickly."
1,Pretty but poorly made,"Admittedly, a $[...] jewelry box is not going to be heirloom quality and its appearance is certainly pretty enough for the 4-yr-old daughter I bought it for. To my adult eye, the box has the appearance of hardened cardboard and the ballerina is painted plastic of the cheesiest kind. The real flaw is that the mechanism that stops and starts the music is of the crudest kind: it basically folds - and sometimes crushes - the ballerina itself. Sure enough - after very little time - the plastic ballerina snapped."
1,Ballerina Jewelry Box,"This product was subpar. I ordered it as a going-away gift for a colleague we dubbed - the Dancing Queen. When it came, it looked used, although it did not state such on the order. When wound, the ballerina twirled for about 30 seconds and then stopped, never to dance again- no matter what we tried. I would not recommend this product to anyone- especially if it is for a child."
1,Pretty But Broken,This jewelry box was broken when it arrived. The ballerina was split in half and the tutu was broken off. I planned to return it but did not get to it in time. It also arrived after Christmas though it was supposed to arrive before then. It's really too bad because the box is cute. I just can't recommend it.
3,Ballerina Jewrly Box,The back of the box broke and needed to be glued. This was a gift for a 6 year old and while it probably was open more freqently than an adult product it should not have borken the first day. Very disappointed in my gift purchases this year. Not sure I direct mail a product without first checking it personally.
2,Wish I had seen the top of the box!,"I didn't think about it when I purchased it - I liked all that I saw. But I don't like the image on the top of the box - it isn't flowers like the side - it's a ballerina. The inside is pretty, but the box looks a lot cheaper in reality. Poor quality construction. Not really bad for the price compared to other boxes online, but not what I would consider a great find. I'll be watching for a different box while I shop in person after this experience."
3,"Great, but ballerina didn't last","This jewelry box is very cute... like I had growing up. BUT, the ballerina on ours has quit spinning when tbe box is opened after only 5 months. It continues to spin when the box is closed and then needs to be rewound with each opening. My daughter has been VERY careful with it, so I dont think it's from rough usage. But, she still enjoys it and uses it!"
2,could have been,"Could have been the cutest gift, but was not.The mirror is not shaped as a heart. First problem.The music is fantastic and in the end we bought it for that specific tune. First good point.After less than 2 weeks of DD (age 6) opening it, the poor ballerina sprung into action (literally) and this caused the poor ballerina to fall apart: the belly separated from the tutu, the tutu separated from the legs and the legs came off the little spring that triggers the dance.We tried to fix it once, and it worked.Unfortunately once it breaks, it will bvreak again. And it did. And when we tried to put it all back together we ended up pushing out one tiny screw that triggered the music.Not a success story.But DD loved it while it lasted."
2,Cheap construction - will not last long,I bought this for an 8 year old - while she was delighted - I was dismayed. Ballerna is on a spring to pop up when lid is open. I doubt it will last long because of the spring
2,poor audio quality,"The performances are good, but the background hiss is overwhelming if you have a good audio system. Especially during soft, lyrical passages such as in the Adagio movement of Symphony no. 8."
3,ALEXS CAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS,"Highlights: Sidesteps vulgarity; often humorous, mainly due to the two 'stuck' leads.Lowpoints: Predictable, sentimental structure; uninspired and cliched throughout; some sloppy scenes that fall flat.Conclusion: While the film wisely never laughs AT but rather WITH his conjoined-twins - the Farrelly brothers' passion for the mentally and/or physically ill ensures that any conjoined twins would most likely enjoy the film, if not necessarily become inspired by it - ""Stuck On You"" is also 'Farrelly Mild', a derivative, yet somehow amusing, affair that will evoke some smiles due to some of its dialogue and the cast, the charm of the leads in particular. But the idea of Cher casting Greg Kinnear in her show to shoot him with conjoined Matt Damon out of the frame is far-fetched, as is the rest of this fun but dumb popcorn comedy."
5,Funny Stuff,I thought this was quite a clever movie. Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear did a good job in this movie. I found myself cracking up hard at various points throughout.
3,"""were not siamies were american""",stuck on you was a little funny and a little boring.it was like dumb and dumber.i do have to say that i did not expect much from it.and i got more than i expected.
3,cute,"This movie surprised me. I like both Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon, but the movie just looked awful. I did not expect to like it, and I did. It is about 2 brothers, who are quite opposite from one another but are conjoined twins, which can make pursuing your path in life a bit difficult. I didn't think it was fantastic or anything, but it was a fun movie, and definitely better than expected."
3,"Redundant, but funny","How many times can you make the same joke about conjoined twins? 'Stuck on You' fills the better part of two hours pretty much repeating the same puns over and over again. Don't get me wrong, I laughed through a lot of it, but I was disappointed at the lack of variety in punch lines.Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear make an unlikely, but great pair.Overall, this is a film to rent. The fact remains: there's about one joke that flows through the entire movie..."
2,Such talent! Such potential! Such crap!,I just wasted 2 hours watching this...I don't want to waste more writing a review.
1,Its not funny.,"Were stuck together...lets make obvious jokes that just arent funny..because were stuck together ... ..lets call the boss... oh.. tell him ""im not here""but the funny thing is.. there always together so where else could he be! .. ohhh. thats just not funnny.nothin else compares to this movie in annoying humor than hmm.. well Twins. the movie that had Arnold and Devito as twins.oh thats so funny there twins but look nothing alike! .. no really.. its not funny. and neither is this."
2,steady decline for the farally brothers,"This wasn't as bad as Shallow Hal cause that was like one of the worst movies in the history of mankind. But still i didn't like stuck on you. It had a few funny one-liners here and there, but all in all, the Farrally brothers have been funnier. Me Myself and Irene, There's Something about Mary and Dumb and Dumber were the brothers in their prime. Lately, with this, Shallow Hal and Say It Isn't So, they haven't been what they once were. Before I watched this I was afraid that it was going to be the same joke over and over, and it started off different than that, but it eventually sunk into being a one-dimensional movie. It was a pretty original idea for a movie, and it wasn't completely blown, but it definitely lost its edge after about 40 minutes or so."
5,Hilarious and Endearing,This movie is so fun. It is hilarious and endearing. The dialogue is just downright clever and witty. It is a movie you should watch at least twice! : )
1,this was a waste of $3.98,"Matt Damon is going in the same direction John Travolta went in the 1980's. and Greg Kinnear is begging to be the next host of Hollywood Squares. I'll take Jim J. Bullock to block, Greg."
1,"PAINFULLY, EXCRUTIATINGLY UNFUNNY","Maybe it's time for Amazon to include minus-star icons for movies that are so bad they are, well, bad.Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear are conjoined twins in the Farrelly brothers' painfully unfunny STUCK ON YOU. Cher and Meryl Streep have small parts but the only laughs are from the blooper real. Too bad the whole feature film couldn't be about two actors trying not to laugh while playing conjoined twins. This misfire of a movie is kind of like the Siamese twin version of Dumb and Dumber but totally, absolutely, completely devoid of wit. Worse, individually these twins come off as half-wits."
2,Could not stick with this one....,"This movie was not funny in the least...boring, stupid, and in some spots down right vulgar....do not let you kids watch this movie if they are under 16....IMHO!!!"
1,The Farelly Bros. FAIL!,"i hpoe you read the top, becaust that's how i feel about this movie. it's not cool to make fun of Siameese twins like that. It wasn't even that funny."
3,What was Damon thinking?,"ok, so my title is a little misleading. Even though Matt Damon is not very known for dumb comedy roles as in 'Stuck on you' he seemed to have enjoyed it. And he is funny as the second part of a Siamese (no, american) twin. But Greg Kinnear is a little better I think.It's a nice movie to watch, nothing special, nothing great but nothing bad either. There are some good laughs and Cher and Meryl Streep have great parts in cameos."
3,Casual Comedy,"Stuck on you is one of those casual comedies that you don't mind watching once but don't beg for more after it is over. I never found myself laughing uncontrollably, but I didn't find myself bored either. The guys being stuck together was kind of cool since there were a bunch of interesting concepts and jokes that revolved around the idea.I figured this movie was going to be worse that it was. The idea of making an entire movie about two guys stuck together seemed less than appealing. The Farrelly brothers did there best to turn out another classic, but it fell short. That does not mean that this movie is a total waste of time and money. Those who are not into the absurd, rude or sex driven humor that is hitting the markets pretty heavy these days might get a pretty decent kick out of this."
3,Better with 2nd Viewing,"One of my favorite movies of all time is There's Something About Mary! I just love it. Matt Dillon is so funny ""she's a real spark-plug."" Anyway, I try to watch all of the Farelly Bros. movies, also loved Shallow Hal. However, Stuck on You was just ok for me. The first time I saw it, I was by myself and it just wasn't that funny. However, I watched it again with my wife last night and it seemed much funnier. Note to self, don't watch comedies by yourself.The acting is good overall, though I'm not much of a Matt Damon or a Greg Kinnear fan. Seems like it could have been shorter by about 1/2 hour and not hurt the story a bit, also the ending is way too long and not funny. I'm not sure exactly what they were going for here.However, for a light hearted comedy, it's at least worth a rental. I wouldn't buy though. Save your money for There's Something More About Mary!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"This movie was not only painful to watch, a feat to sit through in its full 119 glorious minutes, a waste of those precious minutes, proof that my husband really DOES have bad taste in movies (he's like zero for 546), but it had me wondering how Matt Damon, whom I adore, felt about this movie. Was he as embarrassed about it as I was for him? I mean, he was great on Saturday Night Live, so we all know he can tackle comedy with ease, but was this a stretch? Could he actually save the Farrelly Brothers from their downward suicide spiral? The answer is absolutely not. The movie lacks the cleverness of their early works and any laughter is uncomfortable - nothing like '...Mary'. Please, don't waste your time. This has been a public service announcement..."
3,"Greg Kinnear's version of ""Summertime'","Apparently a lot of people are talking about the version of 'Summertime' that Greg Kinnear sings at the end of the movie. There is a discussion about this on musicsearch.com and a Google search on '""Stuck On You"" AND Summertime AND Greg Kinnear' turns up several references. According to the extras on the DVD, Greg Kinnear DOES sing, although he's probably lip synching to his own studio version. The song is a pretty close rendition of Billy Stewart's version of 'Summertime' by George Gershwin from his musical 'Porgy & Bess'. Awesome rendition!"
5,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. A classic!,"I put this movie in the same class as Goodfellas, Now Voyager, Godfather II, Mildred Pierce, American Beauty and The Big Chill as a movie I feel the need to watch every few months. It never gets old. I love the relationship between the brothers. They believe in each other so much. They each think the other is really great. It's a very funny movie but very touching at the same time. There are lessons to be learned from this movie about believing in people, trusting them and looking at people without seeing just how they are different from everyone else.And the cameos are hilarious."
3,"Weird but funny, if you don't have a Carrot Top movie to watch...","Movie comedy with engaging cast (except Ms.Facelift(s), Cher) about cojoined twins. Cutelines in here like: ""In case you hadn't noticed,I'm aging faster than you, I only have 34% ofOUR liver. Don't miss the baseball pitchingor hockey goalie scenes. Not with the StanleyCup running now and another Wolrd Series inOct., as usual. Cher plays a stuck up b*tch -just as we always knew she is in real life.A new approach to comedy about a touchy subject.Pick Up On It!"
3,Comedy Supreme,Get ready to split your sides laughing at the comical antics of twin brothers who not only share life but also share a kidney. Played by Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear the Farrelly brothers show just what a conjoined life is really like when Greg Kinnear decides to pursue his dream of becoming an actor and convinces his twin Matt Damon to go along with him. The situation unfolds in a most comical fashion which will tickle your funny bone until tears spring from your eyes. It is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face whenever you consider this film after viewing.
2,Not as good as I had hoped!,"Best part of the movie for me, was Cher's song at the end during the credits ... ""Human""."
2,mixed feelings,I bought this dvd because of the wonderfull Eva Mendes but i didn't know about the plot...what a surpriseI think there is nothing funny in this movie and sometimes bad taste is at his best.The situation of the siamese twins is far to be a lot of fun and is disturbing somewhere.Sometimes it looks good and there is a little something.photography and music are very good.not more than 2 stars.
1,A Disappointment,"I saw Greg Kinnear in Sabrina and As Good as It Gets, and thought that he was marvelous in both. I saw Matt Damon in Ocean's Eleven, and thought he was great in that as well.I saw Shallow Hal, which was also directed by the Farelly brothers, and thought that (aside from being kind of stupid) it was really funny.I hated this film, and there weren't any redeeming qualities at all. I kept waiting for Kinnear and Damon's wonderful acting abilities to pop out and completely bring back the entire movie.It didn't happen.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone- it was a complete disappointment for me."
2,Doesn't Work,"Watching this movie you can be forgiving about a few things:1) The subject matter is in very bad taste2) The story idea is totally ridiculous3) The acting performances are less than polished.What you cannot however forgive is the fact that this latest gagfest from those auteurs of gross-out comedies, Bobby and Peter Farrelly is actually NOT funny.I am a firm believer in the premise that ""making light of a subject"" does NOT automatically mean that the subject is being taken lightly, but that having been said, any moments of levity here are very few and far between. The acting performances are as you would expect, neither great or excessively bad, but the real problem for me was failing to tackle such a thorny issue as Siamese twins by making it insulting rather than humorous."
1,"By far, the worst Farrelly brothers movie","Sorry, this was indeed a waste of 2 hours. If you're a fan of the Farrelly brothers and liked 'There's Somthing About Mary', 'Dumb and Dumber', and 'Me, Myself, and Irene' you'll probably hate this movie. This movie doesn't measure up at all compared to any of their previous efforts. 'Shallow Hal' was previously the worst of the Farrelly movies until 'Stuck On You'. I mean, NONE of the jokes were funny. Pathetic. I don't think they could make a worse movie.Makes 'Shallow Hal' look as funny as 'Dumb and Dumber' by comparison..."
1,Stupid,I was shocked such talented actors were talked into making such a stinker of a movie. I guess they were paid handsomely. I could not muster enough interest to stay until the movie was finished.
2,"Has Excel-related topics, but a mess to read","I had to buy this book for a CBA course and I must say it's quite disappoining. The instructor picked the book because it has Excel-related topics such as examples and exercises and case studies, but the book itself is poorly written and organized. The heading style, for example, does not define the hierarchy of topics well, and the writing is a mixture of theory and examples, making it difficult for a student to pick out the important points such as ""rules"" or ""principles.""What prompted me to write this review, as a matter of fact, is the mess that's surrounding the examples using the @RISK software, in chap. 9. They give you an example, ""risk example 1,"" and show you the steps to using @RISK, but then in fig. 9.6(d), they present results from example 2 which has yet to be presented. Just annoying.This book could have been a very useful and practical text had it been better organized and undergone professional editing."
3,Punctuality,"It was delivered faster than expected. Good service and delivery. Somehow, I was surprised to find that my 1st order frm Bargainbook was processed as somehow it was out of stock at the time and I made new order. Well, both orders came to me, unexpectedly frm Bargain Bookstore."
5,What a story!,This historical romance had me spellbound by the story from the get-go. All the twists and turns involving the husband and his cousin were fun to read.
3,"This book gives a good picture of what plantation life, slavery, and social standing were like.",I chose this rating because it was a good representation of historic romance. The history factor was very good.The hurrican scenes were very descriptive.
3,"Great author, okay sequel","Don't get me wrong, the Spellsinger series was great and will forever be one of the best fantasy series i've read. So when I heard about the sequel to it, and it was going to be about his son, I got really excited. It was an okay book to be honest. Not spectacular, not completely horrible. Big problems with it though. The idea to make it about rap music seemed a bit contrived, don't get me wrong I love hip-hop, but when reading it the rapping just seemed silly. This book was okay give it a try if you liked the Spellsinger series, maybe one of these days Mr. Foster will write a better sequel (don't get me started on Chorus Skating...._"
3,Plot's fine; rapping very much less so,"Whilst the plot of the book is perfectly passable, the problem with this book is very simple.Alan Dean Foster knows, fundamentally, nothing about rap. Whilst in the previous books the musical connection was obviously based on things that he knew about, this attempts to update itself by changing the musical style used from rock and roll to rap. Unfortunately, the attempts to create convincing rap lyrics fall completely flat. This results in a book which continually shoots itself in the foot by juddering to an awkward halt each time this occurs.For heaven's sake -- I've read better parodies of rap music in Mad magazine.."
3,Problems with Kindle edition,"The book is... ok. It is definitely better than the previous few in the series. My problem is with the Kindle edition. If it bothers you when certain common words have been replaced with the wrong word (""than"" is replaced by ""man"" the ENTIRE book!), then you will be annoyed beyond belief with the Kindle version. I recommend the paperback, unless, of course, the error originated there."
2,Too cartoon-ish,I found it a bit too young for my tastes. It was not up to Alan Foster's usual high standards.
3,Proof reading is a dying art,"First of all, I'd like to say I've been a fan of Alan Dean Foster since 1983. I've owned many paperbacks from him and I have found them all entertaining. Among the many books I've lost over the years was my Spellsinger collection. I was elated to discover the Kindle Editions of these books. I was not so elated over the price. I believe I purchased the original Spellsinger paperback for $2.99, brand new for an actual tangible book. Someone, somewhere, did something to Son of Spellsinger which ended up changing every instance of the word, ""than,"" and replaced it with the word, ""man."" Also, there is a good number of instances where the word, ""the,"" was replaced with the word, ""me.""In spite of all that, the story itself is another entertaining romp through the Spellsinger world."
1,One of the Worst CDs ever,"The only reason to own this CD is if you enjoy ""showing off"" really bad music to your friends and family. ""You've got to hear this...it's so bad!"" Some of the songs on the album are instrumental, and other songs have vocals. But neither are a blessing to the ears. The CD is good for a laugh, but not much else. Might make a good gag gift. It would be a hard contest indeed to vote for the worst song on the album (or for that matter, the best song on the album) but my vote is ""Take My Breath Away."""
4,The Hush.,"After White On Blonde, Texas comes with a refreshing new album. This is one of the best easy listening records I have. Sharleen's vocals are one of the best in the pop scene. There are a lot of different moods on this cd. From songs you can dance on, or to relax lying in the sun. Overal, the record breathes out a warm atmosphere. No fillers here, but the strongest songs are the first three and the last four."
4,Texas,"I dont want to talk about money, or something else (about the change of music between ricks road and white on blonde), I could call it ""evolution"", they just decided to update their music, I see no crime. MAybe the change was a bit too fast, but this is the way things are. Ricks road is a superb album, and the hush (after white on blonde) gave us a different Texas (not better not worse, just different). Nice production, electropop sounds, the blues influences are long gone, electronic arrangements, the guitar is no longer the star in Texas sound. The result is a pleasant one anyway, the melodies have the right arrangements, above all....they sound natural.You have been warned, but I will never regret I bought it."
2,Texas' new sound NOT for fans of SOUTHSIDE or RICKS ROAD,"Only the latter tracks on The Hush are vaguely reminiscient of Texas' best work (White on Blond & Southside). In HUSH, Texas has opted for a lighter ABBA/DIANA ROSS/TLC fusion/pop sound that underscores every track. If you liked White on Blonde and/or Southside, be warned ... this is a major shift in sound. Gone is the textured sophistication that drove Texas' best work ... Sharlene seems to have fallen in love with falsetto singing ... Her voice, while incredible, gets tiresome when she sings falsetto over the entire CD. This cd should appeal to young teengage girls... can't see much appeal to the male audience."
5,Texas do it again,"Once again, Texas have come up with a superb album. Trying to follow up the phenomenonally sucessful WHITE ON BLONDE should have proved difficult, but for a band with the class and talent of Texas, it was easy. It is no surprise it entered the British album chart at number one. It is hard to pick an outstanding track, because they are all equally as good, but if I had to go for one, it would be SUMMER SON."
3,"Very nice, but do cut down on the slack...","The final release from Texas before their Greatest Hits compilation sees them in a confident mood. Their pop-rock sensibilities have been refined, and we get such effortlessly catchy yet substantial tracks like ""In Our Lifetime"" with its Oriental-esque beat, the vaguely cool raunchiness of ""Summer Son"", the adorably laidback ""Sunday Afternoon"", and the ebullient ""When We Are Together,"" their best neo-Motown composition since ""Black Eyed Boy"" (""White on Blonde"", 1997). Unfortunately the rest of it appears mired closer to MoR territory compared to their 1997 record, with either sweet nothingness (""Girl"", ""Day After Day"") or could've-been-betters (""Saint"" begins like the most accomplished Texas song ever, only to be nearly killed by the ensuing repetitiveness). Recommended mainly if one has appreciation of their previous release ""White on Blonde"" (1997). Overall Rating: a strong 3/5."
5,Fantabulous!,"texas has to be one of the bestest bands in the world. the first time i sampled it at the cd shop, i knew it was a fantastic album. it's been four months and i STILL love it. texas forever!"
5,Sharleen's best work yet ! ! ! - Make sure U buy it ! ! !,"This time she's surpassed herself - I just love this album! Tracks like the loveable ""Day After Day"" make this cd simply irrisistable. I can't help but come home after a hard day at college and just chill all night long and listen to this absolutely BRILLIANT cd ! Recently I visited Sharleen and the rest of the band in concert, at The M.E.N. Arena in Manchester, England. I went expecting so much and my dreams were fullfilled ! It was so good, she's such a BRILLIANT singer. If you've not bought the cd already you really must ! ! !"
5,Superb,"By far and away the best album yet from Texas. I have listened to it virtually non-stop since I bought it. The opening ""Once in a Lifetime"" sets the tone perfectly and gets you in great form to enjoy the rest of the album. All the songs are potential hits. My favourite track is ""Tell me the Answer"" - Just a fantastic voice!!!"
3,"It took awhile, but after a few listens. . .","Unlike their previous album, White on Blonde, The Hush took a few listens through till I really enjoyed the album. Although the album has too many ""ambient"" noises, in my opinion, overall I am never disappointed with Sharleen's singing. I did enjoy the Motown-esque feel to a number of the tracks."
4,A departure from the old Texas,"I felt the change on the White on Blonde album, but this latest release seems to be a different band altogether. Very good, but not at all like previous albums such as Ricks Road or Mother's Heaven. I never thought I would hear a dance mix of a Texas record in a club (I did!). If this album doesn't open them up to a broader American market, I don't know what will. Maybe now when my American friends ask who I am listening to, I won't have to go into the whole story about a band called Texas from Scotland; their teenage kids will already have filled them in."
4,"fluff, imitation.... and i LIKE it","I bought this album on impulse after hearing it in the store. You'll love it too, if you liked DeeeLite, Pizzicatto Five, Saint Etienne, Lisa Stansfield. Yes, every song is an obvious imitation of something else: the first three songs sound like (1) TLC, (2) Prince/Alison Moyet, and (3) dramatic ABBA/Erasure disco. ""When We Were Together"" is vintage Supremes. ""Saint"" is totally Sarah Mclachlan/Tori Amos. There is even a 20-second aural wash at the end of the CD and it sounds just like... Cocteau Twins! Yet, the songs are melodic, fun, romantic, funky.... and the production is excellent quality. It's good to have a few more CDs that you can just play on CD-shuffle and just enjoy the pleasant sounds, song after song. This album is good like that. It's not a bold original statement... it's ear candy, sweet... and it never sucks, not for a single moment. Also her voice is lovely."
4,"""This is Howard Cosell""","GREAT BOOK!! Even though it was written 20+ years ago, its still relevant.. ""Jockacracy"" is dominate as ever. Love Howard!!!"
5,The wonderful Wizard of Oz,The book Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz by Frank Baum was a great book! I would rate it five stars. It was more interesting than the movie because the book describes the munchkins a lot better. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes fairy tales and adventures.
1,No illustrations!,We ordered this to read to our 5-year old. When we received it and discovered it had no illustrations we sent it back. The original O'Neill illustrations are so wonderful in the other ones.
3,Another good yarn,"This is another good yarn for the kiddos. Baum's storytelling holds up well and his little lessons are timeless (e.g. the dragonettes insisting beauty is the eye of the beholder) in this unique take on a center-of-the earth story. The science is a bit poor in this book as we see earthquakes swallowing people whole, California being beset by gaping quakes every half hour, gravity lessening at the earth's core, and so forth. Nonetheless, this is easy to look past when the audience is small children as opposed to teenagers.All said and told, this was the least interesting story so far in my opinion, but fine for my young son and fine enough for me to continue purchasing the series."
4,the fourth book,"This is the fourth book in the L. Frank Baum's Oz series of books. In this book, as the name suggests, the Wizard returns to Oz. He and Dorothy find themselves drawn into the Earth and back to Oz. This is an interesting story that is a bit different from the other stories found in the series."
1,A CHEAPLY COPIED BOOK,"I chose this rating because the book is a poor computer copy not even lined up properly on the cover or the pages.We will donate this book to our local library for their 50 cent paperback rack. Oh, it's readable, but for the Christmas present that I intended I would have been too ashamed to give it as such. I ordered another one from another more reputable company instead.I would not recommend this particular book for its inferiority."
4,Oz books keep quality going,It is easy to tell the people involved in these book love the Oz stories and want to be making these. Art is gorgeous (as in all the volumes) and Skottie Young just keeps getting better at making every panel shine. Eric Shanower and Skottie both deserve a lot of praise for capturing the heart and soul of the Oz books while making it their own and work so well in comic form.
1,Misleading,"This is nothing less than bait and switch. It says right on the box that the ""Starman"" video is widescreen (it was shot in Cinerama). The actual disc, however, was pan and scan. What a rip-off. Wouldn't for a second have considered buying it if the labeling hadn't been intentionally misleading, as in fraudulent."
5,The Most Scenic Drives in America,"This book has numerous beautiful color photographs as well as colored area maps where the scenic drives are located. Each stopping point has a number and a description of what you will find. I like the fact that you get the length of the trip, best time to go, and nearby attractions. If one wants to go to a specific state, you now know where the best views are.I like to do photography and this book will be helpful when planning my trips. The book also is a reminder of the beautiful drives within a day's drive of my home.The only thing I don't like about the book is the size. It is a coffee table book and won't fit on my bookshelf without sticking way out. Well worth the money."
5,The Most Scenic Drives in America,A wonderful book for those who enjoy driving tours of our country. Very Helpful ideas.
5,A Wonderful Travel Guide,"This book is organized extremely well and has a good amount of detail. In addition, the photographs are beautiful. It gives some of the highlights of each state. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get off the Interstate and see this beautiful and unique country of ours."
3,Not a great choice!,"If you are a serious traveller who ""clips and keeps"" travel information, then this book is not for you. If you are a ""some time traveller"" then you might enjoy this book. I found that this book includes mostly items which are found in the state highway guides published by every state which most serious travellers would already have. However, the pictures were pretty, but I don't like to spend that much money for pretty pictures!"
3,The Most Scenic Drives in America: 120 Spectacular Road Trips,"A valuable item for the library of any veteran traveller. The road trips, though outlined briefly, give with the additional photographs a quick outline of the countryside to be covered and an appreciation of what will lie ahead for road users and their travelling companions.The work is not definitive and extra preparation is required for specific travelling information. None the less a good place to start."
5,"A more practical alternative to ""1,000 Places to See Before You Die"".",This book has become the cornerstone for planning our family vacations over the next 10 years. A most have for anyone who travels America by RV or car.
4,bootcamp,great workout for lady with difficulty in the middle area and it give you a full body workout on leg n arms.
1,Could not get past the first 10 minutes,"This is not challenging - and not particularly good, even for a yoga/pilates type video. Glad I only wasted a rental (rather than purchase) on this. Waste of time."
1,Not a workout.,"This is lame - essentially, it's yoga. Nothing really challenging; no way to get a heart rate going. Not even much core strengthening. Definitely not like any real boot camp I've attended."
2,Could not get into it,"This is the second of the Core Fitness videos I have tried, and I am just not a fan. Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADD, maybe it's how I sort of feel like the training is a little cold, maybe it's the repetition--inevitably, to me, it is probably clear that it is all of the above. For me to get through a workout, I need to feel involved and motivated. This bored me to tears, to the point that I kept stopping to do things. I will say that I gave it an extra star because even though I did it bored and half-as*ed, I was still a little sore the next day.So for you hard-core's this might be a dream. For anyone who struggles to find a workout that is engaging for an hour---something that might motivate them to workout instead of watching a re-run of [Insert BRAVO television show here], this might not be the best choice. For those I reccomend Yogalosophy, on mute, with Pandora's Black Keys station playing."
5,wonderful,I loved it the first time I saw it and had to own it.. Cate Blanchett did a wonderful rendition...
4,Fab acting,"Great acting, incredible sets - gives you the vision of the sweep of time is reflected in this dvd. Don't view it for history, view it for grandeur."
5,Elizabeth,Great movie...! Highly recomended.Thought guidance is advised when watching it with teen agers..It will help if you read the book first
3,"Nice love story, but historically inaccurate","Whether or not you should buy this depends on what you want from a movie. If you want romance and good costuming, this is the movie for you.If you want historical accuracy, this movie has flaws. For example, the Earl was approximately 25-35 years younger than was Queen Elizabeth in real life.On the good side, there was some historical truth in this movie, and it is worth watching."
2,alas,"Visually opulent, but, sad to say, ponderous and overlong....a triumph of style over substance...pity, because the Elizabethan era is one of the most interesting political periods in history....see ""Elizabeth R."" instead, or even ""Lady Jane"" (which depicts an earlier time in English history, but much better captures the nasty backstabbing of the Catholic/Protestant struggle in England in the 1500s) ...""Elizabeth"" does benefit from some fine performances and has many splendid scenes (especially the closing one)... if only things had been done in 90 minutes or so..."
3,Well Done History,"...but not very entertaining. A very sad movie. Everything that Elizabeth does turns into something sad. The acting is terrific. Elizabeth has to learn how to be a queen. One of the best queens that we have ever had in history. She ruled for forty-three years. But she had to become a man. So after I viewed it, I put the tape down, and didn't want to pick it up again. Lord Robert loved her. And she loved Lord Robert. But it was beside the point. Good direction."
3,Virgin Queen?,"It wasn't a bad movie - historically correct? Nah, but it was entertaining. Cate Blanchett, brings Elizabeth to life, I thought she did a great job acting it (the resemblance to the queen is scary). The writer, should try to stick with history though. I don't understand why he tried to rewrite history, since it is such a fascinating time period anyways. A little confusing, if I didn't study it - it would have left me totally lost. It went from frame to frame to fast without explaining characters and such and it was hurling storylines and characters at you so quickly. It could have been done much better."
4,My Review for Euro. History,"I gave it a rating of four stars, just because of the small confusion it caused because of its historical inaccuracy. In my opinion, however, this was a great film. It was very well thought out and was possibly incorrect historically for entertainment purposes. I think that was very clever too, which made it more exciting to watch. The affairs that took place, and different conspiracys added suspense to the film, on the other hand had it been 100% accurate according to the actual history it would have been a bit of a drag, and not really movie material. It would have been more like a biography, which is sometimes kind of boring to watch. This film touched base with many different situations and aspects of the era, and kept me on my toes the entire time."
1,More propaganda from the English historical establishment!,"This dreadful movie is typical of Hollywood's biased version of History. This film takes extraordinary license with the facts of History and twists them to create a biased farce.The propagandistic English historical establishment is the best in the world at manipulation via mindless entertainment, discrediting other nations, diminishing the history of others while inflating their own, and distorting Historical facts. They, along with the Dutch (research the Paper Wars against Spain in the 16th century) have been masters at the art of deception and propaganda for more than 500 years.The Black Legend in England;: The development of anti-Spanish sentiment, 1558-1660 (Duke historical publications)Tree of Hate: Propaganda and Prejudices Affecting United States Relations with the Hispanic World"
1,No captions,"Please write to Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos to add closed captions to ALL of their Instant Videos offerings. It is not fair that deaf people are asked to pay the same Prime price as hearing people, and only getting a few foreign subtitled films for ""captioning."" THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE! Get Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com to start captioning!!! Thanks.UPDATE: Amazon is slowly adding captioned content to their online offerings now. Elizabeth is still not captioned, though. One star still stands for this."
1,"Mannered, made up mishmash","This movie tells the story of young Elizabeth Tudor, well, at least a girl bearing her name and dressing up in costumes. The movie is filled with errors, flaws and lies. Just the costumes alone are wrong btw. They're not from 1558, actually we see costumes from the 17th century here. A horrible mish mash, Elizabeth never wore gowns like this, the only right one is the last one. Then the ""palaces"" which are not Elizabethan but old CHURCHES! The story itself is so changed that anyone who knows Elizabeth Tudor's true story must be appalled. True, ""Young Bess"" also altered the young Queen's story but they didn't present a trashy, tacky, sex- and blood-ridden ""thriller"" that never took place like this. Elizabeth's true story was exciting enough. Buy ""Elizabeth R."" with Glenda Jackson instead, she portrays the cunning, ruthless and complex Elizabeth we know from history, not a weeping, silly cry-baby."
1,"Bad history, flawewd direction","The history in this movie is bad, even allowing immense latitude to a director for what is after all, intended to be entertainment, not schoolwork. However, a director who is so insensitive as to use Elgar's well-known and evocative ""Nimrod"" from the Enigma variations as a major piece of background music for high Eliabethan drama has no sense of history, no appreciation of music, no ear for appropriateness, no esteem for the audience, and no feeling for the period (Elizabethan England was, after all, rich in music). And that's the problem: a lavish movie can't survive aa director who chooses to be incompetent."
2,Too dark and limited,"I did not like this film at all. I think it is useless to comment about its hostorical incorrectness: the preceding reviews have been really exaustive. What I would like to talk about is the film's atmosphere. Too dark. Renaissance times were not so gloomy. esides, the movie bears no trace of the literary outburts that England knew under Elizabeth. Were was Philip Sydney? Were was Sir Walter Raleigh? It completely skipped Elizabeth's interest in the New World: no trace of Francis Drake or Humphrey Gilbert. Finally, there wasn't even the slightest hint to Mary Stuart. The film director has made a really messy job with his material. Elizabeth's qualities as one of the greatest monacrhs in history just are not there. Watching the movie one gets the idea that her only problem in life was marriage, which is not true. A bad film, in spite of costumes and good performers."
2,EMOTIONLESS,"If the puporse of the director was only showing history, without trying to disguise it and shine it above the truth, I could understand the way he made the movie. But that was not the purpose. He wanted to make an adapted historical movie, with drama, acting and twists in the plot. But he failed miserably. This movie is boring because you can sense the director was trying to complete take the realms of the production, not hearing suggestions from the cast or whoever."
2,What's the big deal about this mediocre movie?,"Even granting this movie some artistic licence and forgiving gross historical inaccuracies, it raises not an eyebrow. Joseph Fiennes performed very poorly while Cate Blanchett did the best she could with a bland and uninvolving script. Geoffrey Rush did provide some welcome relief, but not enough to salvage this passionless (in every aspect of the movie) twaddle."
2,Depressing,"This film is shot in the dark, so it's hard to tell what's going on. I know interiors were dark in those days, but there was such a thing as daylight. It is also gratuitously violent."
1,Overacting; historically inaccurate; bread and circuses,"There is an excellent review by a reviewer Robert Jefferson, on the next page, I cannot add much to the points he made. This movie, in the worst tradition of Holliwood, is similar in approach to ""Shakespeare in Love."" I always wonder why the producers need totake a historical personage totally of of the context of their time and create these soap operas? Bread and circuses - yes; masterpiece - you're kidding yourself! The public seems to care little for history...just schmalz, violence, and sex, and overacting. This movie has plenty of the later. But as a classic or as history..it is pure Trash"
5,The movie that started it all...,"Because of this particular film, I have been extremely interested in the Renaissance era of Europe. This movie was very finely acted and the footage was gorgeous. Cate Blanchett was superb. Sticks to general facts quite well."
1,don't buy--rent,"I always get frustrated with historical films which do not follow history, and this is the latest. The actual life of Elizabeth was interesting enough, why change it?"
5,Movies vs. Documentaries,"Very few historical movies are historically accurate. Who cares? That is not the point. If anyone relies on movie to get their history lessons, then they are pitiful in the first place. The primary purpose of movies is to entertain. Its likely that anyone interested in 'Elizabeth' is not the run of the mill 'Die Hard' fan to begin with, and probably has some true historical knowledge. Those seeking historical facts should visit their local library and stay away from the video store."
4,"Ah, so that's a 'virgin queen'!","Excellent visual entertainment; portrayal of dark times through cinematography expertly executed. Made every Catholic bone in my body go ""ouch""."
4,"Excellent Movie, but it left me wanting more...","It was visually stunning. The ""darkeness"" of the time was wonderfully portrayed. The cast was excellent (my hats of to whoever casted them, especially the Spanish ambassador). My only complaint is that the movie told to little, it left me saying ""what happened to who and why?"" a lot. The movie should have accomplished more, whether it be telling more detail about the story or continue on into the further exploits of the Queen. Please don't get me wrong, all in all a very good movie, I recommend seeing it."
2,Not worth it,"This movie gets very boring, not worth buying. I could never watch it again, Queen Elizabeth although a great ruler gets on anyones nerves by the end of the movie. Too long."
4,I thought that Cate Blanchett was sensational as Elizabeth!,"I found the film to be consistent and wonderfully written. I agree that there are some historical discrepancies in the film, but one is so caught up in the emotion of the film, that it is hard to differentiate fact from fiction. If one compares this film to an opera by Donizetti, author of ""Anna Bolena"", this film had some really fine historical qualities. These historical events may not have occurred exactly as portrayed in the film, but these discrepancies only serve as an enhancement to the entertainment value of the film itself. I felt the film was of the highest caliber and would certainly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Elizabethan era."
3,gave as a gift,I gave it only three stars because I bought this as a gift and did not hear a word from the recipiant if they like it. Bad gift.
2,Somewhat boring,We had been learning about Elizabeth in our history class and we watched the beginning of the movie in class and I thought it was GREAT so I bought the movie (because we didn't watch the rest of it in class) and I was very disappointed with the rest of the film. It was boring and slower moving and never really came to a good resolve.
4,Tears of a clown,"A lightly-veiled homage to the superior Amadeus, this movie speaks of the modern plight of women everywhere who must subvert their femininity to the point of hiding their true natures behind a clown's makeup. The stunning ending is presented with the music of Mozart's Requium, but could easily be replaced by Smoky Robinson's ""Tears of a Clown."""
1,"oh, puh-leeze!","This film is the most ludicrous, incoherent garbage! It would be comical if it weren't so irritating. I kept asking myself as stupidity piled on stupidity -- WHAT were these writers SMOKING?Too many complaints to mention, but I will say if Elizabeth had been this wobbly and retarded, she wouldn't have lasted long enough to inherit the throne, let alone keep it!If you want to see a dramatized version of Elizabeth's life, stick with ""Elizabeth R"", made for British TV with Glenda Jackson. Yes, the sets may be tatty, but you won't notice because the writing and acting are so good, and history hasn't been twisted into a perverted pretzel in order to tell the story."
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,"My motivation to watch this flick was the fact that Joseph Fiennes was in it. I'm not a huge history buff, so this just couldn't capture my attention. After the first 30 minutes or so, even the fact that Joseph Fiennes was in it couldn't keep my attention. My advice: For the history buffs, or those interested in Elizabeth. Otherwise, it's a snore."
2,Reality or fantasy,Customes are great but the plot is confusing? History and this movie don't mix very well. Definitely not on the acting level of Flora Robson and her 1940's movies on Elizabeth.
1,not good at all,"I went to see this movie in the theatre and hearing good things about it, I expected a good movie. I'm sure that it had an enjoyable plot but I couldn't concentrate on anything except the fact that the entire movie was unbelievably dark. I was practically begging for a little bit of color. The other 4 people that I went with felt the same way and we were all extremely dissapointed when we left the theatre."
1,I wish I could have given it 0 stars,"I really wish I could have given it negative stars.This movie is terrible. Others have pointed out the many, many, many historical inaccuracies so I won't bore you with them yet again. The costuming was even more inaccurate.Simply awful."
2,"Apart from FANTASTIC Cate Blancett, I didn't like much of it","I was very disappointed with this film. I love historical dramas and I love British films (by content or production), so I was really looking forward to finally seeing it. Then, I was bored for two hours, watching it. I must say that Cate Blancett has done a brilliant job in portraying such a difficult historical figure, but then again, she always does a good job. I loved Geoffrey Rush in his role. I also found Joseph Fieness more annoying than ever...I thought one film a year would be enough to see him as a ""passionate medieval lover in tights"" (see ""Shakespeare in Love""), but no.... This film gave me neither good entertaiment nor any valuable historical perspective. It is simply dull..."
4,Great movie if you can turn off your Elizabeth I knowledge,"I really enjoyed the movie when I first saw it and knew nothing of Elizabeth or Tudor history. Now that I'm a Tudor history student I'm very disappointed in the film and am only really able to enjoy it because I previously loved it. I know Michael Hirst knows his Tudor history and I'm sad that this film seems to follow the first season of The Tudors on Showtime. Total disregard for historical events and persons. After The Tudors season one was slaughtered with reviews by people who love Tudor history, season two became way more watchable and I'm hoping that Michael Hirst will rewrite Elizabeth I as the next Showtime series. He can do Elizabeth way more honor than this movie and the The Golden Age.Overall, good movie if you don't know the history. If you do I'd skip this one because you'll pull your hair out."
5,Absolutely Love This Movie!,"Cate Blanchett should have won the Oscar hands-down! She was absolutely superb in the role as Elizabeth...and her supporting cast was also outstanding! From start to finish this movie offers it all: a love story, intrigue, murder, mystery, danger and the rise of one of history's most prominent figures! ""Elizabeth"" is an exceptional film...everything was done just so..from the costumes, to the hair, to the scenery...it was all top-notch and gave one a true feeling of the era! Great, great movie!"
5,Very well done film,"I absolutely admired the way in which this film was done. Every shot added to the complexity of the story. I was drawn into feeling as Elizabeth might have felt. It is an excellent exploration into how things may have been. Very plausible, and makes the story very real to a contemporary audience."
3,"Forget Blanchett, this is Rush's film!","Unfortunately, this could have been a great film, and still is a very good film thanks to Goeffry Rush in a truly magnificent performance! However, many of the actors are very badly miscast. For example, Eric Cantona as the French King's representative! Need I say more! Also it is sad to see very fine, but admittedly lower class actors like Christopher Eccleston trying to play the part of noblemen. It just doesn't work! Stick to shows like Cracker Christopher! Blanchett is okay but as I said, this is Rush's film. He should have got an Oscar!"
2,Wonderful and wrong!,"Yes, there is tremendous darkness and violence in this movie---I don't remember ever seeing such a vivid burning at the stake in those opening moments: Cate Blanchett is wonderful---perfect to play the young Queen!Some strange assumptions are made about the history of the period and the Queen's character: for a better picture see Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson. Some of the conclusions are just too weird.A note about the costumes: if you're going to do a story about Elizabeth and set it in a different historical period for some effect, GREAT! but don't try to pass off early 20th century clothes as Elizabethan. Makes my teeth grate!"
1,"Oh, please give your heads a shake","Okay,granted, the costumes were wonderful, but please,HM Elizabeth I would spit on this film. It takes more liberties with her story than should be legally allowed. I will not go into a boring recitation of every fact this movie bastardizes, but Norththumberland was a twit, a brainless, spinless twit who couldnt make up his mind to save his life. To portray him as a 90's style skinhead was just plain wrong. And, there is no proof that Elizabeth slept with Robert Dudley. If you know anything about her psychology, you just know she wouldn't have taken the chance of getting pregnant. This was the 1500's after all. Birth control did not exist. Suffice to say, I hated this film for its inaccuracy and almost blasphemous portrayal of one of the greatest monarchs who ever ruled England. Take my advice and pick a book on the lady, you owe it to yourselves and her to read the truth."
4,"Cate is great, but...","If you get this video and love the performance by Cate Blanchett, or the clothes, or the beauty of the cinematography you're on the right track. If you want a really good and brilliant portrayal of the life of Elizabeth I, get Elizabeth R starring Glenda Jackson. Because, let's face it, this story is wildly inaccurate. It's clear the director wanted to have a beautiful, young leading lady but liked the skulduggery of Queen Elizabeth's middle age. So--he slapped the two together. The result is a very muddled account of one of the most fascinating women in history. Which is a shame, because the real story doesn't need much jazzing up to make it great.Still, if you like costume dramas and Cate Blanchett you can't go wrong with this video. Just don't tell your friends any ""facts"" about Elizabeth based on watching it..."
4,Well done,"This is Queen Elizabeth's rise to power, warts and all. The movie follows Elizabeth from her uncertain status as a spare princess to the assumption of power and, more importantly, her growth as a ruler and the niche she found for herself in history. Well-acted and well-written, the movie is unashamedly bloody but that point in English history was hardly a story of tea and crumpets... it was an age of violence and for better or worse this is what we see on the screen."
5,I love this movie,This is a great movie. I first decided to buy it after watching The Other Boelyn Girl. Cate Blanchett made a remarkable Elizabeth.
3,"Well done, but not completely historically accurate","All of the actors do an amazing job. I really liked the movie when it first came out, but when I recently watched it again after watching all 4 seasons of the Tudors - I was a little disappointed in Elizabeth. They were both written by the same man and the Tudors was much more historically accurate than Elizabeth was."
4,Elizabeth - the Edited Version,"While the DVD was of excellent technical quality and arrived earlier that expected, scenes that I would have enjoyed --like the Spanish Armada's attempt to invade England-- were edited out. This should have been made clear to the purchaser."
3,elizabeth,"In general the movie was very enjoyable, it is very interesting and extremely entertaining. However the movie is very historically inaccurate, but had it been made fully accurate it would not have been nearly as entertaining and a lot longer. Although the actual plot might not be fully true, the movie helps show many other aspects of the time period, such as language, costume, and architecture, it does this very well which helps make it a bit more accurate."
3,Very Good Performances overshadowed by multiple inaccuracies,"I have viewed this film three times since I first saw it during its debut at the theaters. The film is plagued with numerous inaccuracies which is a puzzle to me.Anyone that has read the history of Elizabeth R understands that there was enough political intrigue, religious zealots, overall soap opera drama to just tell the story accurately.In my first viewing I was so upset over the historical misrepresentations that I could not enjoy the film. Fortunately I decided to come back and view it again.The acting is superb. Cate's interpetation of Elizabeth is not as good as Glenda Jackson's performance in the PBS production of Elizabeth R, but it is refreshing and interesting. The supporting cast is excellent too.This film is worth watching even with its historical inaccuracies."
5,A Truly Amazing Movie,"Although the beginning of this movie when three heretics were being burned alive was rather disturbing, I thought that the overall production of this movie was amazing. Elizabeth capturese the emotions of the time period and is beautifully filmed. The score was incredible and really helped to portray the mood of the film. Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes both played their roles with great accuracy and helped to create a very interesting, informative, and captivating movie."
4,"Costume Drama, Not History 101","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and quite frankly am at a loss when I read the negative reviews of folks upset by the historical inaccuracies. Who expects a history lesson from a Hollywood film? That's what reading is for.The point for me is, was the film an engaging and entertaining costume drama? My answer is a resounding yes. My only 'historical' problem was the insertion of the selection from the Mozart Requiem at the end of the film. Talk about a glaring anachronism!"
2,Boring,"This should have been an interesting story. She's a fascinating character and the movie gave me just enough information to form that opinion, but the entire plot was shallow and lacking."
3,kinda boring,"i'm not sure why, but i thought this movie would be a little more than a story of betrayal and lust. i really wished they would have focused on the time before she took the crown, and ended when she finally got it."
1,Fact is stranger than Fiction,"I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie."
4,Edutainment,"All historical innaccuracies aside (can you say 'Braveheart' anyone?), this is an immensely enjoyable film, and I can say that in all honesty, I generally can't stand watching period pieces.Special mention in this film has to go obviously to Cate Blanchett, who deserved her Oscar nomination and then some. But Richard Attenbourough and Geoffrey Rush are equally good, and the costume and set design is nothing short of phenomenal. Watch this film on a big screen and you'll feel like you're a wall in the castle. It's that real.I loved this film for the same reason I love ""I, Claudius"". The actors are all on their marks, and they're never found wanting for conviction. A must-own for fans of historical drama, and a damn good popcorn film for those who're waiting for the next Michael Bay film."
4,Cate Blanchett in a royal performance,"Cate Blanchett does a terrific job as Elizabeth, transitioning from young naive woman to hard, distanced monarch. And the rest of the cast stands up to the challenge of their roles as well. It's great to see a cast consisting of Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush, Kelly McDonald, Joseph Fiennes, and the old guy from Jurassic Park (come on, what's his name again?). All of these actors together with the scene design and cinematography really help bring this period piece to life.Sometimes the plot gets so thick it's hard to follow the story. And with a cast of so many characters it's easy to forget who's being talked about and where their allegiences lie.The DVD does feature a making of featurette and another brief featurette on Elizabeth herself. Overall, it's definitely worth the two hours to check out a great story, and a great film."
2,Beware of HD DVD version,"When I ordered the HD video, I was not aware that my DVD player would not play that verson. I called Amazon who promptly paid for the return of the video and refunded my purchase price. I then ordered the ""normal"" version. (It would have been nice if they could have just exchanged the videos without my having to go back and place another order for a new version. Beware of this DVD if you do not own the HD DVD player."
2,Watery Lizzy,"How could England's greatest female survivor possibly bethe watering pot which this film depicts? Good grief!Elizabeth survived murder, corruption - you name it; yetshe is depicted as being weak-willed and totally maledependent -yuk!!"
3,About a half hour too long.,"This one is okay if you like historical costume films and has a fine acting performance in it by Cate Blanchett. It's worth looking at, but I don't share the excitement of many others."
