2,If you can get past the horrific production...,"...you may enjoy this. But I couldn't get past it. In fact, it was enraging, simply because hidden behind the pathetic quality of the recordings are great songs performed by a true talent. For a debut album, I find it to be absolutely arrogant of him to have not taken the time to properly record the tracks. This album would work much better in the future as a odds and ends collection of 'early Cody' material that would serve as a historical document more than a proper album.Cody obviously has a great deal of talent, so it pains me to not recommend this record. Listen at your own risk."
1,Terrible in concert,"I just have to say I saw this guy in concert and he was BAD. Too much bass, couldn't understand a word he was singing. Yea, I could tell he had a good voice, but what's the point when your voice is drowned out by the bass? It was an excrutiatingly painful experience."
1,Don't Bother If You Like Baseball,"For a baseball fan, this book is awful, almost painful. It's pretty clear the author doesn't really understand baseball. The book is full of obvious errors. For example (from page 69):""Scott Maloney, pumped up for the battle, came straight out and whacked a double off Fisher's second fastball, straight into the left-center gap. Ray Sweeney came up and took the first pitch, an inside fastball he banged right between the first and second baseman. This put runners and first and second.""Okay, a double followed by a single puts runners at first and second? A single on a pitch the batter ""took""? Not only is the author clueless, but apparently no one bothered to employ an editor.Not all of the baseball-related errors are this awful, but most of the baseball narrative has minor flaws, inconsistencies, and just doesn't sound right. I gave up after about a hundred pages, but according to other reviews the book gets worse as it goes along.DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS BOOK!!"
1,NOT FOR FANS,"It's difficult to believe anyone could write this badly. To fail to hold the reader's interest in a sports book, particuliarly a baseball book, is almost impossible. Sports have a built-in dramatic shape. Plus you are usually singing to the choir. Robinson, however, has through maudlin sentimentality, grandiose hyperpole and ponderous repetition, drained the life out of this story.The descriptions of baseball's skills and techniques are so sadly inaccurate only someone who has has never thrown a ball or swung a bat could have written them."
2,Weak storyline but plenty of suspense,"When I read the author bio, I asked myself what a submarine expert would be doing writing a baseball novel. The Seawolves were obviously a fanatsy. In just about every game they one in the ninth inning and came back from a ten-run deficit. The language also detracted from the book and make you feel like these people were being paid to swear at each other. The author obviously knew nothing about baseball and made everyone in the story magically rich to solve all the problems. It was rather condusing considering they covered two season's worth of rosters plus many additional players on other teams. I had to backtrack so I would know who everyone was. Otherwise, if you want to read a baseball book and have nothing else to read, this book is perfect for you."
5,LONG LIVE THE THREE INVESTIGATORS!,"This exceptional mystery from Robert Arthur has more twists and turns than an Alfred Hitchcock movie! The Mystery of the Fiery Eye (#7 in the series) is just one more fine example of how far superior the Three Investigator books are to the Hardy Boys and any other series on the market today. This book would make a fantastic gift for any kids' birthday - or for that child that is already bored one week into summer vacation. Help keep the Three Investigators alive! Purchase The Mystery of the Fiery Eye, and all the other re-issued Robert Arthur titles!"
1,No pix,No photos in the book; I was expecting pictures.Big disappointment. I gave the book away as a White Elephant.
4,I liked it,"The Master Printer's Workbook is not a classic how-to text, but I can't agree with the negative reviews posted by some other readers. Macleod uses a selection of superb photos as examples for demonstrating various printing techniques. Images of Iggy, Paul Weller or Kylie are a lot more interesting than the pix you see in most books on the subject."
2,"The Title ""Workbook"" is laughable!!!!","This is without a doubt, one of the worst books on technique I have ever read. So poorly written that I did not even finish it. Seems to be more of a showcase for the authors work, than anything else. Pictures but darn little info about how they were made. Don't waste your money."
4,Ditto re above review re printing details inadequate,I agree with the above review 100%. I had great expectations about this book yet experienced disappointment about the sparse technique details. Bartlett's book is immensely more fantastic in its presentation and can't be beat!
5,Excellent,I was expecting a used book in good condition but got a brandnew one. very happy with purchase
1,Purchase experience,"I never received product I ordered. I was told a new order would not be shipped, and was not! My credit card was credited, but I would rather have received my order, which was Memorex 650MB/74-Minute 4x Data CD-RW Media (25-Pack Spindle).I could not review product because I never received it due to lousy customer relations!Stan Zak"
4,Good Manual,"This is a pretty good manual for the 1100 V star, with decent pictures and good info for the owner of this bike."
3,Clymer Motorcycle Repair,"Somewhat disappointed, the repair manual was not specific to my motorcycle. I have a 1999 Yamaha V-Star 1100, which is covered by the manual I purchased. However I found it somewhat unreliable in the repairs I needed to make."
5,Great book,This is a very interesting book. There is no doubt the author has done his research. It not only covers the cure for diabetes but touches on all disease. I have purchased 6 additional copies after reading it and sent them to all my family members that are diabetic. I gave my copy to a neighbor who is also diabetic. He started several of the suggestions and in a matter of two weeks his sugar levels are much better. If I could afford it I would buy copies for the entire neighborhood.
1,This most likely a SCAM!!!!!!!,"Ask yourself this question...If you watched your mother die from diabetesand associated dieases, and you somehow founda cure for that disease; a disease that kills millions ofpeople throughout the world and you're a healthprofessional: what would you do? Put information out forpeer review, or start a website and sleasy infomericalswhere you told no one about the ""cure"" until they paid you37.00 USD. I don't think this is your magic bullet. Saveyour money. Don't let yourself be victimized..."
3,Shortened concert-Buy different edition,"Show from Aston University, 1979. The CD is approximately 30 minutes long and has 12 tracks. The full show has 15 tracks, and is approximately 45 minutes long on the Receiver Records CD with the same title. Buy that edition.Also, part of this show appears on the Blue Plate Special CD, which is really cheap, and is great because it has some of the Coventry Automatics tracks, which are harder to find and more expensive."
3,Typical early Science Fiction,"This pulp novel, originally published in 1935, was the first science fiction book I ever read and, though I doubt it stands the test of time as a great literary classic, I remember it fondly. The plot in a nutshell: A human male goes underground (on the Moon?) where he encounters a matriarchal society of pale people who've never seen the light of day. It was cheesy and funny and opionated and I've never forgotten it, though I have forgotten a lot of the details (maybe it's time I pulled it out of my parents' attic and reread it). I'd recommend it if you enjoy reading early pulp science fiction."
3,Not reversible,This is a nice belt however its advertised as reversible to suede and the one I received was not. Again a nice belt but for $70 I can't recommend.
5,A Cherished Gift,Beautifully illustrated and cut; children and adults love it. I recommend keeping it in plain view for anyone who enters your home to enjoy.
3,alice in wonderland pop up,Great Book. It LITERALLY gives new depth to an old classic. I actually bought it for my girlfriend for valentine's day. She absolutely loved it.
4,"Well made, good pop-ups, faces aren't so pretty",Length:: 0:43 MinsThis is a brief video walking you through the pop-ups.
5,Amazing book,"I gave this book to my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She was amazed when her mother opened it for her. Even my son wanted a turn looking at it and then said it was ""so cool!."" I will say that because the book's pop-ups are fragile my granddaughter will be supervised when she looks through it, since she can't read very well yet her parents will be reading it to her anyway. At her age she needs supervision with all of her good books. It's a very nice book and I was so happy to watch my granddaughter's smiling face as she watched the pages open. I plan on getting more of these books for her and my grandson."
5,Georgeously Detailed Work,"Children and adults alike will marvel at this beautifullly detailed book of Alice in Wonderland. I hope the publishers come out with a BILINGUAL version: Alicia en el Pais de las Maravillas so the growing population of Latino children in the US can read it in Spanish and so American children can learn a new language while viewing the pop-ups! Another fabulous book for those seeking adventure and beauty is Drum, Chavi, Drum!/Toca, Chavi, Toca! (Set in the colorful Calle Ocho, Little Havana festival where a little Cuban girl makes her dreams come true). Alice and Chavi will bring joy into children's hearts and so these are the two books I recommend as Christmas gifts this year."
4,It Could Be Better,"It could be better tf this toner cartridge can yield more pages... It is still much cheaper when compare it to HP, NEC, Samsung, or Lexmark."
1,Didn't work,I ordered both the black and color cartridges but neither one worked. They printed out the test page but won't print anything from my documents. The merchant said they would send a replacement about a week ago but I haven't received them yet.
4,It works!,"I am using this to filter the dust on the side grille on my Antec 300 case. It does seem to cut back on airflow considerably, but I don't have a fan on that spot and have plenty of airflow otherwise. It does it's job admirably! If I did decide to put a fan there I would probably looks for another dust screen that was less restrictive."
1,not so filter filter,"looked really bad for a filter, putting a napkin inside the frame would have been better. but u get what u pay for."
3,"A screen, not really a filter","These are actually screens, and provide very little filtering if any, I am placing some cut to fit black prefilter medium under these screens to filter out dust and small particulate that would not be caught by them at all. Some reduction in air flow, but at least it is keeping the damaging dust from getting inside my case.. I would not buy these again.."
3,as advertised,"It is the one in the picture. I would had liked for it to have a better build quality, it seemed like it was going to break just when bending it a little. Also the sides are not straight"
2,"aluminium filter, sure...","The filter is basically a piece of aluminium with four holes (which do not work for set screws), so if you can buy other product more expensive but also more complete, you do it."
3,limited uses,they are what they are.. but one thing to note.. they are not flat. they are concave so keep that in mind
4,Great Filter!,"Pros: It fit my antec 300 side fan just fine and is already doing its job captureing dustCons: Didn't come with longer Fan Screws to make up for the thickness of the Filter. lucky I managed to find a couple so its only mounted from corner to corner, not all 4 holes."
3,"Good, but there are better","It does its job, but not so well.It keeps dust of my Case Fan, but I still find dust on the fanOverall, this is ok, but there other better, cheaper filters."
1,size way too small,The product is very unusable and not at all what is advertised. You can hardly hold the towelettes to wipe on your skin. Very very disappointed.
2,Very Over Priced,"This is for one towelette, not for a case of 100. The company gave a prompt refund but the item is still listed incorrectly on Amazon. Several merchants offer the same item for much less.SUN X SPF30 SUN SCREEN INDIVIDUAL WRAPPED TOWELETTES 25/BOXThe shipping is even more over priced than the item itself. The merchant charges $8.02 to ship an item which can be mailed for 44 cents."
2,Not as effective as I would like,"I bought this for my daughter to use at summer camp as she's out in the sun all day, every day. Although she's not burned yet, she is extremely dark and I can see a lot of redness in the cheeks. I probably would not use these again."
1,False advertising of product: Sunscreen wipes,I ordered 6 of the 100 pack Sun X SPF towelettes: Bulk case for what was advertised as 5.99 each. I received only 6 individual packages and they charged the full price of over 50.00 with shipping for 6 individual wipes. The internet support agent appologized and said i could return them for refund(I did). It was false advertisement by what i thought was a good company. But due to the response i intend to take my business and all future purchases some place else. It is rediculous to think i would pay $50.00 for 6 individual towelette packages. I hope the change the price as listed or others of you will be stuck like they tried to me.
1,Returned Product,When I went to your web site the product was listed at 25 packets fof 99cents and so I ordered 2000 as we have kindness outreach at our church to hand out sunscreen packets. When I received only 80 I called you number and you told me I had to email Gearstuff.I did that and they email me back that it was a mis print on price and they did not have 2000 packets to fill my order so I requested a full refund and they refunded the full amount as soon as I sent the 80 packets UPS with a tracking number on a label they sent me.Therefore I did not use the product.
3,Ali-Frazier I Buildup and Battle Misses a Punch,"This DVD should actually be titled something like Ali-Frazier I Prefight and Fight. The DVD is actually a movie that was first released in either 1971 or 1972 about the first fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.There's some great footage that captures the personalities of both Ali and Frazier. There is also some great training footage of each fighter. The tension of the prefight buildup is captured beautifully. The presentation ends with the actual fight.So why am I giving this product just three stars?Because the video quality is very poor.The producer of this product did no editing to clean it up or digitize it. There are too many scenes where you can't clearly see the faces of the individuals. The visuals are somewhat distorted and the film appears very grainy.If the producers ever decide to digitize this film, it would be a five, easily."
3,It is clear and does it job well,"I reviewed this product on several sights. It is a laser fax. It is clear and does it job well with no problems. The only minor thing is slight curling sometimes on edges of paper. I am pleased and has a great price - had it delivered to them. I bought because my old ""Brother"" died after 10 years of service."
2,"not a ""speaker phone""",Misreprsented as a speaker phone - even though I called and spoke to a Brother representative who told me it had a speaker phone function.
2,It Jams,We have had two of these and both suffer from paper jams. You have to babysit the product to check to see if a fax came through. The workmanship on this item seems to have fallen off greatly.
4,Just as described....perfect,"So far so good, very easy to setup. Simple plug and play. Just make sure you install the printer software from Brother's website BEFORE you plug in the USB cable. Laser printer works perfect....just like a normal laser printer. Fax machine works even better....its soo freaking fast, compared to our old inkjet fax. Copier is also really fast, but it's a sheedfed copier...not a flatbed. And ya...no scanner, just a really fast great laser printer, copier, and fax."
3,Brother IntelliFax 2820 review.,Easy to set up and use. Prints very clear faxes and copies. Great as a primary fax machine and occaisional copier. Only drawback is copies and faxes come out slightly curled due to the heat from the laser.
2,Machine has a mind of its own-beware!,"I bought this machine 6 months ago and generated about 1000 sheets of fax/copy/print documents. At this point it told me that my cartridge was running low on toner (it wasn't) and shut itself down. Technical support said that maybe it was a defective cartridge and that the only way to get it running again was go out buy a new cartridge (difficult for me to do since I live on Maui, which has little such supplies). Why the machine couldn't have just warned me, and NOT shut itself down is beyond me. Imagine running an office and in the middle of the day the Fax machine says I quit!Of course those advanced users are saying, ""All you have to do is put a tape over the hole that the sensor reads to check toner level."" Well I did this and it worked for awhile, but it still knew it wasn't a new cartridge because I still got low toner warnings. Then 2 weeks later it shut down again.I does generally work ok however; in 1000 sheets I only had 3 jams."
1,Sleep Mode Issues,"Just bought a fax machine, opened the box, installed it at the office. Fax goes into sleep mode - followed directions and they don't work, I don't get the option of turning sleep mode off. Pressing the start and options buttons simultaneously DOES NOT WORK (this machine is not even a day old). Called for assistance and after a grueling 30mins and no solution, I was given a local number to contact. When I called the number it was a service center that told me to return the machine since it was brand new. Called back brothers and after they asked me to let the machine go into sleep mode again and call them back - I am still on hold and have been informed that i will be for the next 15 minutes. Basically this sucks - we can't receive faxes when the machine is on sleep mode even though the manual emphatically states that it can! - we will be returning this machine and getting an HP. Tech support is absolutely unacceptable."
2,Brother Intellifax 2820 fax machine,"After installing this fax machine in my office, I started getting calls from some clients telling me that they were not able to fax documents to me. Other clients were able to fax me. I double-checked all connections and had AT&T check the phone lines. Everything was fine, except that not all incoming faxes were going through. After three weeks of this, I went to Staples, bought another Brother fax machine (not the 2820 model), and hooked it up. It works fine and all faxes now go through. I can only conclude that the Brother Intellifax 2820 that I purchased through Amazon was defective. Will someone at Amazon please send me a pre-paid UPS label so that I can ship the clunker back ???"
1,very bad quility,"in 5 minutes this fax become very hot, fax function never worked. i am very unhappy with this fax, will retun it and never buy brother brand again"
5,"good print quality, so far so good.",This is my first fax machine from Brother. everything works ok. So far I'm satisfied.
3,It works,This works fine and the price was ok. It's a little slow but it works. Not sure I would by a Brother again though.
4,Wonderful!,"This is the third machine that we have purchased for different departments and have had wonderful success with all of them. The supplier was very quick, ordered one day had the fax machine the next!!"
2,Will never buy again!,"The company I work for use to use Brother fax machines and replaced them about twice per year. I bought an HP for the business and worked great for over 10 years. I was on vacation when the HP finally quit. One of the owner's went out and bought this brand Brother, because it was cheap. Drums costs are outrageous at $100+ for new original or the inexpensive worthless compatible. It has cost more my repair time, drums and toner in the past 2 years than the HP had in 10 years. Can't wait to replace it! Brand new drums needs replacing within one month. However, toner last a long time. We receive about 700 faxes per month. Drum should last much longer than that!"
1,Feed Issues,"The printer grabs multiple sheets of paper instead of one and prints the page across the overlap. Had to reprint pages multiple times before it fed properly. Fax is nice that I can answer the phone and it will detect if a fax is coming through since it is a shared line.Have to restart and retry printing 3-4 times before it actually does anything. Junk, do not recommend."
1,Bad service from the vendor,"This equipment arrived minus 2 parts, and without an owners manual. It was obviously used a lot in spite of the write up that said it was hardly used. I would not recommend this vendor. They have not responded to my requests for the missing items."
4,I great fax. I'm still adjusting to it.,"It faxes well, prints well and so far has offered no paper glitches. It also handles different thicknesses of paper well. I think its system of scan, dial and send is great. But I'm still adjustin to it.Give me another month, and I'll probably give it all 5 stars"
4,Fair,"Excelleent print quality, good connectability, a couple of negetives: the machine will not print a confirmation on reveived fax, indicating the number of pages received with sender information, some difficulty setting the auto redial on busy numbers. overall the unit is a high quality machine, robust and easy to operate."
2,Missing a few basic functions of normal fax machines,"This fax does not have the option for 12 hour time period, its only in 24 hour time period according to support. Also, there is no way to tell the machine to set it in AM or PM time, you have to guess which one it'll be, and set it again if its wrong.This fax does not give a confirmation sheet when receiving faxes, only when sending, so I can't tell if I have received all of the sheets that the other end sent us, our old fax machine would do that, according to support this is not a feature of this machine.This fax does not display the phone number on the receiving sheet that is sent to us so we know who sent it to us, our old fax machine would do that; once again according to support this is not a feature of this machine.According to some these are absolutely necessary functions to have, it works ok so far, other than that. The machine is a little slow in scanning as well. I will be returning it because it does not have these basic functions."
4,"Great Fax Machine, But I Wish It Printed Face Up.","The fax machine works great. My only issue is that faxes print face down, which is annoying when you walk by and can't see what has printed. Other than that, it works great."
4,Tone End Life Error Fix,"If you get a Toner End Life error that you can't clear this will work . . .Open front cover, leave toner cartridge in unit.Press options button, when ""Replace Drum?"" comes up quickly press the Start button. Immediately press the ""1"" and ""0"" button. The display will say ""Accepted"" and the error will go away. Make sure you enter those buttons quickly or it will not take."
1,Not a recommended product,"When it trys to print some paper out, it produces some screaming sound, I feel if my machine is going to die or will have a short life. Plus, sometimes it cannot catch a paper from the tray or catch 2 paper at the same time"
3,good machine but the toner can leave black lines,I realize that it's the 21st century and who uses fax machines anymore. Well I got it for my father that doesn't use it often but when he does expects it to work. I chose this because of the name but not the best in quality toners. The toner it came with caused black lines to go all the way across the documents. Even after cleaning the roller inside as directed. A replacement toner was all it took to fix this but what a waste of money. I had to replace a new toner cartridge because of poor quality.
3,Canon LA-DC58F Adapter,"This adapter replaces the decorative ring on the Powershot cameras (I use an A620) and provides a 58mm thread to add filters or conversion lenses. This adapter is fine for filters or close-up lenses, but as it is made of molded plastic I don't think it is suitable for wide-angle or teleconverters, which can be very heavy. For the latter, I would recommend the LensMate adapter which is machined aluminum (I don't work for or get any compensation for this, their adapter is just better for heavy lenses). Be warned that with some non-Canon-recommended conversion lenses, your camera's built-in lens may bump the rear element at extreme zoom, so be careful!"
4,Good but flawed,"We needed a wide angle lens for our Canon. This does the job, except for a design flaw which might be a factor for others. When the flash is on, the wide angle lens covers part of the flash's light and casts a shadow. The shadow then appears on the shot."
1,Not worth the money.,Dont bother upgrading your Power Shot Camera...Just buy a better one. The zoom lens ads a whole 5 ft to the view before the pixels become a big issue.
4,A Family Saga During the Civil War,"The lifelike protagonists overcome religous barriers to marry during the Civil War. The story vividly describes war scenes and the struggles and attitudes of Irish immigrants in the 19th century. In a nutshell, ""Love Conquers All."""
5,Rock solid satisfied,"We had a new well dug last year and the well cap is in the front yard and visible to all. We purchased the Dekorra Rock to cover and conceal the well cap. The Dek Replicated Rock that we purchased was the perfect size, does not look out of place due to our other landscaping and therefore did the job it was intended for."
1,APC Backk-UPS RS,"Unit worked fine until the first power outage, which apparently damaged the unit. After the power returned and for months thereafter, it produced an annoying beeping sound. Replaced the battery with a new one but the beeping continued. Finally had to replace the UPS with one of another brand. I have 2 good UPS batteries looking for a home."
4,APC Backup RS 500 VA,This is a good product but a little light weight. Only will carry the computer about 8 minutes.
5,great,A good recording. Great performance. I do enjoy the misc of Joachim Raff. I have also enjoyed the symphony series. This complements this series very well.
4,Mantis Aerator,This attachment worked as expected. Saved me a lot of cash compared to having it done by a landscape group. I was able to swap the attachment onto the Mantis Tiller in about 3 minutes and it worked just fine.
2,Good Deal !!!!,"If you're restoring a neglected lawn, this is an essential piece for your Mantis along with the dethacher. I've also used it in flower beds for light weeding as it's not as agressive as the tiller tines. Overall rating, 10+ and Amazon shipped the next day, FOR FREE."
5,I have to agree,"I haven't quite finished the book, but I'm going to fire this off anyway. Never having been a great reader of biographies, I was hesitant to start one asfat as Volkogonov's *Stalin*, but the book grabbed me quickly and hasn't let go. Well-written and utterly absorbing, it beats most novels for sheer narrative drive. We all knew Stalin was bad, but you may not have known he was this bad. Get it and read it."
1,This book needs an editor,"This book has potential to be great, but what it really needs is an editor. It's painfully obvious that it's self-published and even more obvious that it didn't go through a revision process with a qualified editor.The author also seems to not be able to separate herself from the ""inside"" of track racing. Many terms are unexplained or just poorly explained. I thought it would be a good book to learn the rules of track racing as a spectator, but it just left me with more questions. Next race I watch, I'll just print this and keep it in my back pocket: [...]A second edition could maybe do this book justice, but it may be too late."
2,Great subject/unfortunate book.,"Considering all the material assembled in this book and the people interviewed, this book is a major disappointment. It seems virtually unedited, repetitious and poorly formatted.Good trivia gets swallowed by trite opinions.It is unfortunate that a mediocre book like this will probably deter or delay a serious treatment of track racing."
3,Pretty to look at- not good for busy people...a dirt magnet!,"I love the look, but it became stained so easily with normal use, I was embarrassed by it after a few weeks! Maybe a darker color would be better. The clear hard colored shells that attach directly to the laptop are getting more popular now & look just as groovy and are far more functional. Hard-shells eliminate the need to take the laptop in and out of the bag and also protect the exterior while your using it. These types of soft fabric covers now seem old-fashioned in comparison. I'll be buying attachable hard shell covers from now on, especially since they offer groovy designer colors now too."
4,a rough diamond,"This album is like a rough diamond, the more you polish (play) it, the better it gets.Arno is probably the best Belgian singer since Brel, he is a performer Pur Sang.Rock, Blues, Chansons, Slow, Up Tempo it's all on this album.Buy it, polish it,l ike it and in time Love it !!"
5,Fought over daily in our home,"Both my girls, ages 3 and 16 months, absolutely LOVE this little bus. When you push down on the driver you hear either a phrase, music, or horns beeping, and the other seats move up and down as it's pushed along the floor. They love to fill the seats with all of their Little People and push this bus all around the house. It's also holding up excellent to the daily abuse from two toddlers."
5,My daughter loves it,"At first I though this toy would be quickly forgotten, but this has become one of my one year old daughter favorite. She put the little people in and out of the bus. Open and close the side and back doors. Put the little people through the doors. Play with the sound. Push the bus. All in all a lot of pretend play and fun."
4,My little girl LOVES this bus!,My 1 year old loves this bus! So pleased with how well it holds up and easy for little fingers to handle!
5,"Solid, no problems","Even though it says here that this is a new card, it's not: I've been using this card on my homebuilt system running both NT4 and Win2000 with a Western Digital 18GB drive for about two years now and never had a problem with it. Was easy to install on both O/S's. Completely happy with it."
1,Bad things....,I had nothing but trouble with this card. After adding it to the computer (Dell R450) I started having hardware conflicts which eventually lead to a complete crash of the computer. I was never able to recover and had to rebuild the box. Needless to say I didn't add the card after the rebuild.
4,Comprehensive,"Love this book. A full guide to all things crystal, it even has some names in it that are hard to find. I use this on a regular basis."
5,Great Book... Full of information.,"This book has a lot of very useful information about stones and their properties. It's easy to read and to understand. The only drawback is that there are no pictures of the stones. I'd definitely recommend purchasing this book, but maybe supplementing it with a book on how to identify the different stones."
4,A great perspective,"Written in the simple and personal style for which Conway is known, this work carries on in the tradition of a more folklorical and Pagan perspective of working with minerals. This book helps integrate history, tradition, and the more New Agey perspective, and Conway also adds a bit of mineralogy to the mix.This work largely addresses crystals for their healing and ritual/magickal connotations, and thus adds a facet that other comprehensive works leave out. This is a must-have for all crystal workers, especially those of a Pagan or Earth-based worldview."
2,Caution: Pinecar is not Pinewood Derby,"It seems like this booklet should be free on the counter of the local hobby shop. It is a sales tool for Pinecar products. Pinecar is not Pinewood Derby, it uses a solid axle and different wheels.As far as construction instructions go, I own every Pinewood derby book and I'd say this is the worst one I have read. Save your money."
5,A good resource book,"This book has tons of labs and demonstrations. Many of the labs and demonstrations can be found in other chemistry texts and on-line, this book brings them all together with good explainations and illustrations. Herr and Cunningham have included additional information for the teacher and there are thoughtful extension questions provided for the students. This is a good resource book. I allow my students to try the labs after school and when they come in on their free periods. My only gripe is that it sometimes takes careful reading to follow the procedures as they are written in paragraph form."
5,"Buy for a year, own for a lifetime.",Lois Greenfield's work makes me green with envy. :-)The images are so phenominal and alive with movement that this calendar never blends away into the well.The calendar portion is also excellent for practical use with a soft colour scheme and small intersecting images.Then once the year is over just cut carefully and store under glass.
3,Just average,"I think the taste is fine. The noodles split very easily, like most foods made without gluten. My son is extremely picky and will eat this but it isn't his favorite."
4,Love this cookbook!,"This was a great find. The only thing I was disappointed about was the recipes that Bonge's Tavern chose to submit...I would have loved to have the recipe for their Sugar Cream Cake, Harger Duck, or the Sauteed Mushrooms they serve as an appetizer. Even so, this book is great. I've made several things from this book and haven't been disappointed!"
4,At Long Last!,I've been looking for this CD for awhile. Once again I found what I needed on Amazon! Paul Kimble is a multi-talented genius! This should have received more wide spread play and promotion. If you've not heard it I recommend you give it a listen and enjoy!
1,How disappointing,"I thought this might be a worthy purchase considering the people mentioned this guy's influenced by and has worked with. But it seems all he's gotten from these brushes with fame and near misses at celebrity are delusions of grandeur. The music is, at best, self-fulfilling only, and the lyrics are full of narcisitic bitterness I can't quite stomach. The title track is the most obvious reference to this, with some childish ripping on what I can only assume to be a lover who rejected him or revealed his ugliness in some way and then the hilarious line ""Go f**k some other star"". Does this guy think he's a star just because he's met a few? How sad :("
1,Doesn't work with Sony HVL-F58AM,"If you own a Sony HVL-F58AM don't waste your time with this item. It doesn't work. The way the Sony flash pivots is different than the design of this flash diffuser. The diffuser does physically fit on the flash head, but it is 90 degrees in the wrong direction. The reason for the 1 star is this is another product/listing that doesn't state compatibility and it appears that anything made by Gary Fong is Sony unfriendly. I learned my lesson and hoping to save other Sony owners time and money."
4,Choices,Multiple Choice was a fun read. Lots of places where I literally laughed out loud and had to read passages to my friends. It was a really enjoyable story and even the proverbial happy ending.
4,Real life for me..,"I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it's a quick read and not especially deep but it sure hit home with me as my daughter (whom I am very close with) is getting ready to go off to college. I told her I was reading this and the basic storyline - Daughter at college, Mom decides to go back to college albeit a different college and they both apply and get the same internship - and her response was, you had better not do that Mom. My daughter sometimes talks to me that way and I talk that way back to her the same way. It just rang all too true to me and I could relate to March. A keeper."
2,Snoozer !!,"I thought Must Love Dogs was a cute book. It had humor, and was entertaining to read.This story had the potential to be entertaining. Mother daughter relationships are always full of ups and downs. However, this book never went anywhere. Olivia, the daughter, was an annoying brat. Her mom, March wasn't very interesting. The dad and brother had nothing to contribute (unless you count the whole finger nail clipper dilema interesting...not). Whats the point of this story???!!I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing did. Except....I fell asleep."
2,Non-Satisfying Fluff,This book is very watered down. It's like showing up starving for a Thanksgiving Day meal and finding all that's being served is salad. There just wasn't any substance to it and it didn't go anywhere. The daughter was a little brat and the Mom allowed it. The characters had no character and it just didn't feel real. It was my mistake too because I didn't know that this is the kind of book the author writes so I had higher expectations.
3,"A fun, easy read, but nothing special","I enjoy Claire Cook's writing, but this book was little more than a nice, easy read as I waited at doctor and dentist appointments, etc. I wanted to like the main character, but she was so formulaic and undeveloped that I felt like she was a caricature, not a character. Most of the story line was highly unbelievable (even for escapist fiction) -- for example, both the mother and the daughter end up at the same college-course internship where the daughter learns for the first time that her mother is enrolled in college. The middle-aged mom facing temptation from a male who finds her interesting and exciting has been done ad nauseum, and Cook's version is weak at best. In short, I was quite disappointed in ""Multiple Choice"". My advice? D. Check it out from the library and save your money for something better."
2,BORING,"Since I found this book in the bargain bin for $4.98, it should have come as no surprised what a stinker it turned out to be. There wasn't one likable character in the entire thing, other than perhaps Etta. Even March, the main character, was so judgmental and whiny, it was hard to route for her. Like the other reviewers, I found the daughter Olivia to be a ridiculous, over the top character. Who acts like that? Maybe a younger teen, just going through puberty would be at that ""I hate my mom"" stage. But if a college age girl still treated her mother with that much contempt, then yes March, you must have done something wrong in the way you raised her. The entire book was just a description of March, going through the motions of her rather mundane life. I half expected the author to describe her using the toilet or shaving her legs. I read to escape or be entertained, neither of which happened during this aggravating snooze-fest of a novel."
3,A good basic overview,"Mary Geham's book offers a good basic overview of the history of New Orleans' gens de couleur libres. I would recommend it to people who know nothing about this portion of New Orleans history or for children, however, it is not very comprehensive. For a more complete and fulfilling account of the free people of color of New Orleans and their descendants, you will have to look elsewhere, for example, Creole New Orleans: Race and Americanization, Eds. Joseph Logsdon and Arnold Hirsch, or Romanticism, Revolution, and the Afro-Creole Protest Tradition in Louisiana, 1718-1868 by Caryn Cosse Bell."
3,Nice cover but color is misleading,I just bought this cover and it is very nice and protects my phone very well! The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that it is a lot lighter than it says and looks.
5,One of Glenn's strongest albums...,"This is one of Glenn's strongest albums. Each instrumental projects a different mood...from melancholy to happy to tranquil to exciting to romantic and so on. Glenn should really consider movie scores. On this CD from 1990 he plays both 6 and 12 string electric and acoustic guitars, electric autoharp and keyboards. He also has Bill Rea who is the best bass player that no one's ever heard of. Rea gets some amazing sounds out of that fretless and I would just love to hear him play with Adrian Belew someday. The only weak link in the band is the drummer who sounds like he's from a high school garage band. But overall this is a very strong release."
1,NOW I remember why I never buy Hartz for my parrots...,"At least 75% of this bag was cheap fillers, such as sunflower seed, dry corn, peanuts, and soybeans. I sat for over an hour and worked through it, cupful by cupful, pulling out much of the junk, and ended up with half a bag of semi-acceptable food for my 8 parrots - and that was leaving the sunflower seeds and the garish artificially-colored bits and neon-dyed seeds in the mix. I always combine several brands together in my feed jar, and it's only for this reason that I didn't return it. The outside birds got the junk, and I've mixed in extra portions of the high quality foods to make up for the inferior quality of what was in this bag. What a shame that I spent money on this."
4,Easy to find...online,"When my rabbit was a baby I found this food at Petco, Petsmart and even Target and Walmart. Little by little they all stopped carrying so when I would find it, I'd buy 4 or 5 at a time. Now they have substituted it for cheaper brands (made in China) which stay on the shelf and don't sell and I know this for a fact. Seems to me if something is selling well, why get rid of it. That being said, the price did go up quite a bit in these stores for a 4lb bag and that may have something to do with it. My rabbit is a picky eater and she notices when she doesn't have her brand food and she rather eat plastic, literally, then touch her food. So now I have a spoiled rabbit who'll only eat this as part of her regular diet. She gets fresh grass, fruits and veggies too but she loves her Hartz."
1,disgusting - shouldn't be allowed to sell this with the statements they do,"This is so blatantly unhealthy and inappropriate for rabbits it's shameful that they're actually allowed to make the statements they do on the packaging. It's NOT 'nutritionally complete' or anything like it, and most of the ingredients they use are things rabbits shouldn't be eating at all... They might like it, but only in the way a child would like being fed a 'nutritionally complete' diet of oreos and snickers bars. No wonder so many pet rabbits only live a couple of years if this is the kind of stuff people believe is OK to feed them."
1,sell what is advertised,"I'm very disappointed that what we received is the blue packages of Hartz in the mail. I thought you still had some of the original food in the warehouse. The picture shows the original packaging. The new blend is completely different than the old food. I hope and pray our little bird will get used to the new food in time. I mix the old & new, but he won't eat very much of it. I have shopped all over and finally found some of the old food."
2,Item we got is different,"I saw good reviews and ordered it but what i got is ""Parakeet Canary & Finch Nutritionally Compelte Blend"" Lesson learnt check what you have ordered and what you got, It has lot of wheat and lentils, almost 20-30% is going waste, my birds are not enjoying it and feels bad to throw a cup full of seeds every 2 days."
2,Not as pictured,This shows that the product has a lot of colorful/flavorful food bits when in reality the bag is mostly just the pellets. We were looking for a food with more than just pellets so this did not live up to our expectations. If the shipping wouldn't have been in play I would have returned this product.
3,okay dvd,"I didn't learn a lot from this dvd, but I think it would be great for someone just learning."
2,Laibach's vision of a Beatles classic.,An amazing blend of Industrial stylings mixed with a classical flair. An excelent buy for fans of Laibach or the Beatles. This CD rises to the top of many cover albums. END
1,I Don't Get It,"I bought this compact disc for the lovely cover of 'Across The Universe"". Other than this one track, there is nothing I would listen to again. Unless you are a Beatles completist, save your money."
1,"MINOR CHORDS, MAJOR LETDOWN","Wow...I guess there is no accounting for public taste. This is lame stuff...all the same songs, but re-worked with doom & gloom-sounding minor chords that really do nothing to pay homage or to enhance the original songs. Like most cover songs/albums, you end up really respecting the original that much more. This would be considered garbage if you heard it before the original album. This sounds like the Residents just sat down and decided to record the 'Let It Be' album after returning home from a funeral. Maybe these are the Residents in disguise? Nah, they'd do it better justice than this. But, if you love the Residents........"
5,i sat through a laibach cover cd and all i got was this lousy t-shirt,"All these negative reviews... obviously pretentious Beatles lovers. As another reviewr said, most Beatles lovers will no doubt be angered by this disc and not ""get it"". Well it's their loss because this album is pure genius. The Beatles wrote it, Laibach re-wrote it thus, genius. If you read the negative comments you'll see that they really aren't objective at all, rather subjective to the person's own prejudices & tastes. Why am I not speaking about how the albums sounds? Well there's no real way to describe it. Perhaps The Beatles inside out and on their heads? Go into it with an open mind and you'll be pleased. Go into this expecting some ass-kissing interpretation of The Beatles, forget it. This is what a true cover cd would sound like."
3,An Amusing And Irreverent Trashing of The Beatles,"One of Laibach's more engaging albums. Though it lacks the brilliance of Nova Akropola, this one is worth it for the hilarious massacre of I've Got A Feeling. Levity, Laibach style."
2,Un-Fulfilled Potential,"I wanted to like this movie. It started with an interesting storyline about a complete outsider to gaming getting drawn in, but it decayed into a re-re-hash of the stereotypes we've seen over and over. The ending hinted at redemption of the outsider and the validation of gaming as a form of socializing and storytelling, but the script never delivered."
2,Fellowship of the DORKS?,"Having seen the trailers I expected the production value of this movie to be between ""The Gamers"" and ""The Gamers:Dorkness Rising"" and I was right. It's not bad but the story line is not what I expected. The characters are drawn with a hand that is heavy on the ridiculous. One character literally has the mentality of a 10 year old (mentioned on the DVD case), one is a self-published author of a unknown book ""The Zen of Acting"", etc. The central character is actually violating house arrest to go to the game and she has never role-played before in her life.I will say some of the things that happen I've had happen in my own game, including the GM taking someone aside to get feedback on the game, so it's not all bad just overall not what I was expecting. I love good movies about gamers and the gaming community but wish they wouldn't treat us as a joke or something similar."
3,Fun Read!,I like this book. It was very eye opening. As a man just coming out It helped me with alot of my hangups.
4,Pretty good,"It was not as complete as I had hoped, but added satire as I learned how to accept and move on with my life regarding my sexuality."
3,What world does he think we live in?,"What world does the author think we live in? Exercises such as ""having six coffee dates in a month"" or ""getting 10 numbers during Pride"" betray just how out of touch he is with those of us who don't live in Chelsea or the Castro. For someone living in a smaller city in the Northeast where six coffee dates in a year is pushing it, this kind of advice is so entirely unrealistic that it just comes across as a form of taunt. I find this to be a common problem with gay advice books. I wish someone would write a book for the rest of us."
3,"no jack, just the cover","I supposed it was the whole patch panel with the jacks included, now I got just the cover witch is kind of expensive for a useless devise, I hope you guys don't buy this product since you wont get really any thing."
4,Sleeping pretty,The trundle bed arrived and was easily set up. I like that the top frame can be adjusted to a few heights to accomodate the mattress thickness on the trundle that slides under.
3,Humble Abode Trundle bed,"Packages arrived very early in the shipping window which was nice. In putting together the bed, the hardware was not appropriate (read on) and lacking and I had to go to the hardware store for bolts, nuts, washers and lockwashers. There were only four carriage bolts (barely long enough) and serrated lock nuts provided to mount the legs to the frame which could not be tightened enough to keep the legs of the bed from collapsing on the screws. Needed two of each with the lockwashers on each leg from the hardware store. Otherwise the bed and trundle seem fine."
4,Convenient,I love this trundle. It's very convenient for house guests and everyone loves it when I show it them. It saves a lot of space in my guest bedroom/office. I bought two inexpensive foam mattresses on Target's website and it's actually very comfy.
4,Good quality.,It is not easy to find the complete trundle unit at a fair price. Shipping was faster than expected the price was great This item was accurately described and the quality is good. I appreciate3d the care that was taken in the packaging.
4,Good value card,"I build computer systems for sale, and use this in all of my lower end systems. The driver setup is simple and straight forward, and I have had no trouble with any of the cards I have purchased. It is a great bargain for people who don't need any advanced features but still want quality stereo sound."
3,Ensoniq and Microsoft Sidewinder 3d Pro issues,"Great audio card - however I have the misfortune to find out that this card does not work correctly with the non-usb Sidewinder 3D Pro. ...Installing the DirectX 8.1b, Lastest Sound Card Drivers, and Sidewinder 3.02 drivers doesn't help. The controller is listed as not-connected. You can use it in analog mode, but you loose much functionality...."
1,"Please, Get Some New Material you drunk b@stard","First of all, lets get this out the way, I'm not giving this album one star, I'm giving Ron White one star. I love this album, but only because its the first thing I ever saw or heard him do. He uses the same exact material that he used for ""They Call Me Tater Salad"", ""Truckstop Comedy"", ""The Blue Collar Comedy Tour"", and ""The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again."" On a comedy central presents show he did the same material. The first time I heard the words ""Take off the hat!"" come from Ron's mouth I was in tears, but now I've heard it so much I'm sick of it. Carlin, Pryor, and even Foxworthy have different material for televison specials. Please Ron, get new stuff."
2,I wasnt impressed,"Ron White is a great comedian, but this album does not do him justice. Before buying this cd I had already heard most of the tracks just by listening to his shows on Comedy Central and the Bob and Tom show. He just isnt as funny with out seeing him. I was really disappointed with this cd. Most of it is just the crowd laughing which makes it really hard to hear him at points in the cd. Personaly I think $13 dollars can buy better things than this cd."
5,"""I Want To Be Drunk In A Bar!!!""","Ron White's CD Drunk In Public is one of the funniest comedy CDs I've ever heard! I love it when he talks about the Sear ""Tire Guy"" forgetting to put his lug nuts back on and now he's going to sue Sears. He plans to own the Sears Tower and rename it Ron White's Big F***ing Building! It cracks me up!! This album deserves a 9 out of 10 and I definitely recommend it to anyone! Hilarious!"
2,Dave Allen has got exactly what you want!,"Mr.Crane,Can I suggest to you that if you thought that 39 minutes wasn't enough next time you should seriously consider at least one and maybe more of Mr.Dave Allen's DVD's.Sadly the gentleman has passed on but his material will be here,and certainly enjoyed,for evermore."
5,Tacky and Hilarious,"Though not as good as the cd, Mr. White leaves out some prime lines, you'll still laugh out loud. His great talent is not just timing, but the cadence of his voice that makes ordinary language hysterical.A former comic,Loretta Collins"
3,Small Toy- Big Price!,"This is cool tool. It walks on 4 wind-up legs. Its looks mean. The problem? the price. Hey, when you campare this toy to the average Happy Meal Toy, theres not alot of differents. Its on-par with your average Star Action figure in size. I paid close to $30 for this thing! It was a Christmas, and this was the to-have toy requested. So up came the $30 bucks. Its a cool toy, but worth $30 bucks. Maybe $12-15. Hope this helps with your decision."
5,Yo Crunch yogurt!!!,Pairing crushed oreo cookies with creamy yogurt is one of the best combos in dairy eating!!
3,a good start for postgraduates,"A comprehensive books covering the most important issues of fuzzy sets theory, including applications, mainly in the fields of linguistic variables and data analysis. A good source for people with sufficient mathematical background (measure, integration). An extensive bibliography provides possibilities to continue the study in various directions."
5,Classic Style and Elegance,"Jana Hauschild Lindberg gives us pieces with great taste and style but with a sophisticated simplicity. She has chosen motifs that vary from Scandinavian Traditonal Design to Alphabets, Florals, Holiday Designs and a beautiful sophisticated Zodiac. All graceful, elegant, and beautiful. Her style is as approachable for and as attainable by the new student of Cross-Stitch as for the experienced. I really enjoy her work. I'm also pleased that she anticipates that a new student will see her book as a window to the art and provides primary instruction to cross stitch. Her pattern charts are in black and white but they can be enlarged on any copier and colored if so desired."
1,review,The motion-sensor does not work; you have to press the button.The face does not turn around to face you unless you turn it by hand.
2,Billy Bass Singing Fish,"I give this 2 stars for novelty value mainly. I had a Boogie Bass and thought I was ordering something similar to that. Boogie Bass has about 10 one-liners plus a couple of great singing and flapping tunes. And its head swings away from the plaque, looking very realistic. Billy Bass is a poor imitation. Only its mouth moves at all and he sings two songs, neither of which is all that good...and stops abruptly at the end. Billy Bass just doesn't have it. He's good for about 10 minutes and then the novelty is over."
1,Be Careful - Software Does Not Work,"This was a waste of money. The software on the CD-ROM does not work. There is nothing special about my computer system so it was something wrong with the software on the CD-ROM. Be careful, you were forewarned."
2,Johnny Cash DVD,"This is not the documentary. There are many Man in Black titles. I have been buying a lot of J. Cash lately because my mom is a huge fan. I had just bought and watched Johnny Cash ""At Town Hall Party"" and found it entertaining because it is of his very early years. So I was disappointed to watch JC ""The Man in Black"" because it is almost identical to Town Hall Party. The difference is it has less songs and it included a cd. I look at other sites for info and this dvd is supposed to have critiques but what you really get is a subtitle across the bottom of the screen with a quote from someone. Unless you want everything out there Johnny Cash, this or Town Hall would be enough. Both have his Elvis impersonation."
3,Pretty good high school level motion offense.,"I am editing this review. I should have given this 4 stars instead of 3 after viewing the video again. It will not let me change the number of stars I gave it.The audio is horrible on this video, but the motion offenses he shows are actually quite good and I plan on using at least one of them for my freshman level AAU team.There are a lot of mediocre videos out there that give you little good info. This video is actually pretty good and I do recommend it despite the crappy audio."
4,Fashion tips that can save your life,"By reading this little book you can find answers to your most simple and/or the hardest styling questions. How to make my hips look sharp? What should I wear to a job interview? And for a promotion? Oh, my, I am a petite, what flatters the most my figure? Those are questions that you will certainly find an answer for in Kimberly's book. Of course that this is just a warm up. By reading it, you will step into a more stylish you. Be sure about that."
2,"Decent advise, but no photos","I'm always suspicious of a book on fashion that doesn't have any photographs, and cartoonish drawings just don't cut it for me. I will admit that the author has a sense of humor and that having the chapters divided by weather condition and/or fashion situation is useful. However,......the advice contained within the book is not really worth more than a skim at the bookstore or a checkout from the library. Most of the advice you've probably heard before, but the author organizes the information in an easily accessible way. Therefore, I would recommend this book to fashion novices. However, for those of you who are fashion junkies like me, I would skip this book."
3,This book is for the Glamour magazine age group,The book has alot of helpful information for young women. I did not like the poorly drawn illustrations.
5,Love Diabetic Advanced Healing Cream,I am a diabetic and have used this product regularly for several years now. Really helps my feet and hands to stay healed but also helps with the chaffed skin and rashes I get on my legs and thighs sometimes as well as the eczema on my arms. I am prone to yeast infections under my arms and between my legs. I like it's soothing relief whereever I happen to get a yeast outbreak. It is well worth the money.DIABETIC ADV HEALING CREAM Size: 4 OZ
2,Out of date,"Dramatic story of diagnosis, and then unfortunately out of date. Treatment of type 1 diabetes is rapidly improving and changing. This means books have a short shelf life. Look for something more recent."
5,They don't sell this flavor anymore in stores,My girlfriend loves this flavor and they don't make it anymore!!! Why do you do this to me AIRHEADS??? This is the best flavor!!! Please bring this flavor back.
3,Good product with misleading title,"The product is good for those who knew what it really is. When I looked at it and read ""Practice Pad"" I believed that's what it is ... Turns out it was a cover for a drum so that you could use it at home without disturbing the neighbours. The product is great for those who need it, but the title is really misleading ... Shipping and handling was properly done and up to standard, so no problems there."
5,Pitcairn Island: Life and Death in Eden,"Excellent, exciting story of what happened AFTER the Mutiny on the Bounty. The author, using original source material, did extraordinary detective work to draw conclusions from limited sources about how the mutineers ended up slaughtering one another, as well as a few sympathetic natives who escaped with them to the miniscule island of Pitcairn--not even on the map at that time. Only one of the original white men survived (having killed or watched the killing of all the others).It's a sordid story of swapping ""wives,"" drunkenness on home brew, murder, rape and the survival of the fittest--here the most devious and cunning. That did not include the famous Mr. Christian who was among the first to go. Gripping story and a good read."
1,Didn't work at all,"I bought a Belkin USB hub with a power cable thinking it would be a powered hub. Well, the red light came on indicating that the power cable was working, but the USB connection never did work, regardless of how I tried to connect it to my computer."
4,"So Far, So Good","Seems like other users had problems with this system. As for me, everything worked great. Hooked-up a game pad, a Wacom drawing pad pen/mouse system and everything works fine. The setup was painless and straight forward. I didn't even need to use the AC power. By the way, the mouse works great. It was smooth and accurate unlike the other reviews. To me the cable does not slip out of the hub as others reported. Just a straight forward device that does the job as advertized (for me)."
3,Inexpensive hub for non-powered devices,"I've had this USB hub for about six months, and it has worked flawlessly so far, with one very notable flaw. Devices, which derive their power from USB, like some webcams, cameras, and scanners will not work with this device. So far, my webcam is the only thing that will not work with the hub. My mice, yoke, usb pedals, joystick, PDA/phone cradle, and anything else I have plugged in worked fine.The AC power adapter is bulky, and not really needed considering this box doesn't act like a good self-powered USB hub anyway. I was able to disconnect power and it still works fine (and free up some space on my power strip)."
1,"Misleading ""powered"" Hub","This is not a good product if your USB devices need power. Even though the hub comes with a Power Supply, it does not power the devices plugged into it. For me, that makes this a worthless hub. The 7 port version provides power to the bus, and is therefore far superior."
1,Dissapoints,"Since my iMac only has 3 USB ports. 1 is used by the keyboard. 1 for the printer and the last for a router. BUT that still leaves my scanner, DSL modem and VOIP telephone. So I bought this hub. From day one my computer would report low USB power. I would then have to unplug 1 or 2 things to get something else to work. Although it pluggs into a power outlet, apparently, the individual ports are not powered (self powered). I replaced it with a D-Link which is working GREAT with things plugged into all 4 ports. I recommend that you pass on this product and go with a D-Link."
1,Didn't work,"After plugging this unit in, I received a cryptic error message about ""missing function drivers"", and the unit simply didn't work (with or without AC -- the hub is designed to run either way). The online Belkin support did not help.Thinking my computer might be the problem, I tried a linksys 4-port ac-powered usb hub, which worked immediately. I'd recommend staying away from this Belkin usb hub. (My computer is an IBM Thinkpad, running Windows 2000)"
1,it did not function,"I bought this unit to connect my growing array of usb peripherals. the AC adapter fit just fine, unlike previous reviews. but whatever i plugged into the unit could not be seen by my computer. The unit is supposed to work with the windows ME usb root hub drivers installed with the OS and therefore no specific drivers are needed for the unit, but it did not work out that way. and no drivers are supplied at all on the manufacturers website as a ""just in case"". so save yourself trouble and buy a different brand."
2,"Wow, it's BIG.","Received the item and am amazed that it is so big. My old one was 1 1/2 "" x 3"". This one is 3"" x 6"". It's attractive with the pc board visible and it lives behind my desk anyway. The power supply is small and sleek."
1,It died in less than a year.,"It died in less than a year. I guess that's ""planned obsolescence"" for you. It dies right after the warranty does."
1,Does not provide power for devices,"This is a USB hub that works only for devices that do not require power from the USB outlets. If they draw power from USB, this will NOT work."
5,I forgot I had it hooked up.,"This has been great for me. I got it over a year ago. I am running Win 98 so I can't respond to the XP problems people mentioned but I don't even notice its existence. I have never even hooked up the power. I run an optical mouse, Palm cradle, scanner, and USB powered speakers. I love it and told my dad to get one."
1,Don't make my mistake!,"I bought this relatively expensive hub because I needed something powered for my web camera; it was a mistake. The hub couldn't power the camera appropriately - it wasn't powerful enough. I ended up using it as an unpowered hub for my other devices, and putting the camera on a new USB PCI card (which actually cost about the same). It only worked properly for a few weeks before it mysteriously stopped working, one channel at a time. I tried to contact Belkin about the ""warranty"" but apparently they don't answer e-mail regarding this issue. I tossed it in the trash, a $...mistake, less than 3 months after buying it. Avoid it if possible....."
1,Overpriced hunk of plastic,Doesn't provide enough power to run a scanner or camera from. Works no better than a ... unpowered hub.
2,Printing Problems.,Bought one of these hubs. Ran into problems immediately when attempting to print large files of photographs. Would only get a small part of the photo printed. Thought is was the printer or a buffer size problem. After getting a USB error I decided to by-pass the hub and plug the printer directly into the computers USB port. That worked great. Took the hub back to get a replacement. The replacement had the same problem. So now I by-pass the hub anytime I want to print anything as I may or may not get a complete printout no matter the size of the print file.
4,Works fine...just be careful in storms,"I got this about a month ago. It worked perfectly fine right out of the packaging. My computer (running Win2k Pro) immediately recognized the unit and it took about one minute for the driver to install. I had my cable modem, printer, and smartmedia card reader attached to it in no time. Just be sure to unplug it when I storm comes through. I heard a pop from my living room during a rainstorm, and it turned out to be the unit getting fried by lightning or something. Luckily, I was able to exchange it for another and it is working just like before. I have learned my lesson. Overall, a good buy for your usb needs."
1,"Has power supply, but not enough power!?","This hub comes with an external power supply, which in theory enables it to be used with peripherals requiring significant power (scanners, webcams, etc.); however, turns out that I could not use it to connect my webcam along with DSL modem and mouse, because the power was insufficient! Hard to believe, but true.It is now sitting in the bottom of one of my drawers..."
1,Avoid! (especially Windows XP users),"Buying this hub could be the worst thing you ever do to your computer. I run Windows XP, and it warned me that this hub is not Windows XP certified. Fine by me, since most hardware isn't, but works just fine.Everything was going fine until I tried plugging in USB peripherals. None of them worked, including my Logitech Quickcam, Epson C80 printer, and Handspring Visor cradle.Later that night, it was driver conflict hell. Before long, I lost my entire Windows XP install due to repeated appearances of the Blue Screen of Death (yep, it does exist in Windows XP after all).Needless to say, I will never buy another Belkin product again, if I can help it."
2,Inadequate!,"I bought this hub to use with my Dell Dimension 4100 desktop 18 months ago without doing much research. The installation was a breeze, my computer recognized it right away after I plugged in the AC adapter and connected to the available USB hub. But like some of the reviews I read, there is not enough power of this hub to work with my Cannon scanner which is not self powered, nor the Thurstmaster gamepad I just got. It does work well with my webcam, mouse, smartmedia card reader and digital camera. Still it is a pain to have to get around to the back of the case to unplug the scanner if I want to use the gamepad, or vice versa."
2,Fine for low power users,"I rated this a 2 star. It worked find for my camera at first. But then I got on the USB band wagon and started replacing my worn out serial port devices with USB and BAMM! The hub did not work. In fact I finished looking all over the Belkin site for some assistance. No drivers to help. I did learn reading the reviews that others were having the same problem. I ""tried"" to keep my scanner, printer, APC and CDRW drive working but it just hung up and stopped. Worked for a while. Might keep it for the kids computer. Look past this one, go for a better product if you want to connect items I listed above."
2,OK if you only need for self-powered devices,"Works fine as a hub but beware, it only delivers 100MA to each port, and many USB devices need more power from the hub to ""see"" the connection, ie: my card reader for Compact Flash and Smart Media needs 500ma but my PDA needs nothing. So I had to go out and buy a more expensive hub that delivers more power and threw this one away, a shame."
2,NOT for self-powered use,"I bought two of these Belkin USB hubs due to the number of peripherals I bought with my new computer. Almost all of the peripherals required a self-powered hub, but the AC adapter did not fit properly and worked itself loose on BOTH hubs within several days. The hubs work great on bus power (which does not require the AC adapter), but these are unreliable for sefl-powered (AC) use."
3,"Lasted about a year, couldn't use all ports.","Meh. For the use I got out of this, I might as well have bought one of the cheap generics. What I mean is that I would have expected a cheap noname hub to perform this well, but it may well be that they're even worse."
2,product failed within a year,"I'm not certain exactly when I bought the 4-port hub. I believe it was about a year ago. It appeared to work well with my PowerBook G4 and my new iMac, but, as noted by others, it does not provide power to devices even though it is itself powered. Other than that it worked OK for a while, then simply quit working. The lights come on for about 5 seconds, then go out. Short? Anyway, I'm going to try another brand as a replacement."
1,Bad Bad Bad USB Hub,"This thing...! I've had it for 6 months for use with my laptop. Everthing works fine when power adapter stays connected, but, as another review mentioned - it rarely does. It's Belkin's ""economy"" model and it shows. At least you would hope that the power cable would actually make contact. Unfortunately, I don't have an alternative to recommend."
1,"worked, until it almost burned my house down...","Unlike most of the other reviewers here, the Belkin hub actually worked for me. True, I'd get an annoying popup from Windows whenever I turned on the printer or scanner that ran through it, telling me that the peripheral in question would run faster if I plugged it directly into the computer, but the speed didn't bother me. I got a good 5 years out of it, easily.Until I came home today and caught the unmistakable scent of melting plastic. Checking around, I felt the AC adapter for the hub, and it was insanely hot. The ventilation grille had started to melt. I guess that about wraps it up for this hub, since I'm sure not going to use it again!"
5,Great Quality,"The book was received promptly, and came in great condition -- but at an even better price!!!! Thanks for making this experience unbelievable convenient, I searched around several sites and by far the best price and quality."
5,Pure gold (and blue),After drooling over the Sing Ray filters I stumbled upon these and was sold on the price alone. The optics are perfect and the effect is a great way to turn drab mid-day light into alien sunsets.
2,the jury is still out,"I purchased the garden rocker a short time ago. I think it will be good in certain situations, but I also purchased a garden seat with wheels and think the garden rocker will be good for certain situations and the seat with wheels will be good for others. Before I would purchase it again, I would think about the garden seat with wheels. The rocker does tilt, but sometimes I find myself almost falling off backwards. Will have to get more use to it over time."
3,great idea....needs to be made sturdier,"I really liked this until I heard a ""crack""...the center post has a large crack in it. It hasn't broke all the way, so I'm still using it but am waiting to fall on my ""crack""."
5,Garden all day with no back pain,"I have used this for years and totally love it. I had knee surgery in college and can't squat or kneel comfortably but love to garden. I also volunteer to work in gardens. I find I can scoot it along my weeding path and love the longer reach I have. And it's great to be able to stick my hand tools in the pockets and have them at my fingertips rather than spending hours trying to remember where I set them down last.It may be somewhat of a problem, to some of you, to keep your balance, but I'm a canoer and kayaker and am used to rocking my hips as I move to maintain stability and love the rocking which also keeps my back from tightening up.I gave my original seat away when I started traveling but now am on-line to buy another so I can garden most days more efficiently, longer, and without back pain.I'm over 70 and think this would be a wonderful gift for gardening friends that have reasonable balance."
2,Can't Tell How Good as Cannot Raise Seat Level,"The default seat height is way too low for me. I tried to raise... had to use hammer to get screw out of existing cheaply made plastic hole. Then with screw out, I tried to extend. I pulled as hard as I could but nothing moved at all. Will have to wait for husband to get home and see if we can pull together - will return if can't. Screw pole base area poor quality.Note: I also purchased this with sliding rockers. That one GREAT! Much better steel tube/easy sturdy screw assembly and I had no problem extending height on that one."
1,EZ close,We have two of these on one storm door and this product has been a total bust. They allow the door to slam shut and it can not be adjusted to hold no matter what you do. I would definitely not recommend these.
5,works well and keeps screen door from slamming,"We're using this on a lightweight screen door and it works great. The button to hold the door up works well and it works well to slowly close the door and prevent slamming. The installation instructions left a little bit to be desired, but I eventually figured it out. Only complaint is that it only allows the door to open 90 -- a little further would be nice, but it's no big deal."
2,FYI,"The design of the door closer is good, but it is for light weight doors only, such as a screen door. For a regular wood or steel door, the closer will not work. It lacks the strength to close the door tight."
1,Too strong for my door,Opening resistance on this item is too strong. I did not install it for fear that it would damage my door. I had to to purchase another (adjustable) model at my local big box store.
4,Great product so far,"Only had it for a day but already pleased. Easy to install and looks good. I wish it caught the door a little earlier but it does slow it down better than our old stopping/slowing device. My favorite feature by far is the foot stopping feature. Works very well, I just hope it stands the test of time here at the beach house. Rust can quickly destroy anything metal here."
2,Door Still Slams,"It's nicely made and well built but it does not stop the door from slamming. It works really well at slowing the door down but at the last moment, it let's go and the door slams closed."
2,Missing one fundamental function,"The touch n hold feature is slick, but this is a door closer, and it does a poor job of closing the door. The pneaumatics work well to slow the door to within about 4 or 5 inches of closing, and then it lets go entirely, allowing the door to slam into the frame. And there is no way to adjust the final closing speed. I have it on a storm door, and it does not matter if it is holding the heavier window, or the lighter screen. Both close HARD, and I can't seem to do anything about it. I'm going to replace this with something better."
2,Didn't work,"I had a problem adjusting this door closer. I called customer service, and spoke to a girl who was no help. Frustrated, I ended up using the two brackets and threw the closer away."
2,"Doesn't Last, Cannot Adjust","I've had this door closer for a few years, and one day it just stopped working properly. I tried every which way to adjust it: changing pins, adjusting knobs tighter and looser, removing one piston and adjusting the other independently. If it is adjusted tighter it stops 4-5 inches from door frame (as others have noted) and if it's loosened it doesn't provide any resistance at all and smashes into the frame. Piece of junk!"
5,Easy to istall and works like a charm,"These were installed in minutes over my existing brackets, only. They are a huge improvement over the old ones that required you to reach up and fiddle with a round metal stopping rings. The strength of closing is adjustable with a simple screwdriver and I now have the strength set so that the door doesn't slam at all, it closes fast until the end, the slows down rapidly and closes with a whisper. The fact that you just push a button to stop and then just have to nudge it to close is super convenient."
3,Average product,"I would grade this product a C+, it works but you won't use it thinking it is the best product you ever bought. The tap to stay open feature is very convenient for grilling and going in and out the door but as other reviews it does slam hard the last 2 to 3 inches to close."
1,"Useless ""reprint""","This particular reprint is unusable. A certain amount of marginalia, and even some smudged/ambiguous symbols are to be expected, but this is beyond anything I've seen. Virtually every series of equations has at least some crucial part of it completely whited-out, and on some pages it is clear that several centimeters were cropped off of the outside edge, leaving whole columns of text out.The problem doesn't seem to be the source material, either, as can be seen by comparing the ""preview"" with the actual book - symbols that are clear in the preview are totally blank in the book (eg bottom of page 21).Planck's book itself is a treasure; but this version just isn't usable. I've had problems with ""Forgotten Books"" before, and will be more careful to avoid them in the future.Amazon was good enough to give an instant refund (less shipping), provided I print some labels and drop it off. Don't make the same mistake -- try a different print."
3,"L.B. Evans Men's Duke Opera Slipper,Burgundy","Though described as Burgundy, which is one reason why I bought it, it is not, it is brown. Leather is medium soft, though slipper is comfortable.Sizing is good. Good slippers for the money."
2,"Nice Fit and Style, Mediocre Quality","Comfortable, light and enjoyable to wear. Despite wearing in carpeted rooms the slipper disintegrated quickly compared to what I expected from such a pricey item. Leather started to tear at the flex point at the center seam within weeks. Seams split around sole a few months afterward. I've read of LB Evans slippers lasting years. Not this model. LB Evans fit and style, Chinese knock-off quality."
4,Great Family Movie,This was a fun movie with an uplifting message. It's nice to watch something with your children that you can enjoy and has a moral message. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a wholesome family experience.
4,"Good but not excelent - Bueno, pero no excelente","He escuchado a CGT desde sus comienzos de la mano de Robert Fripp. Este es un buen trabajo, sin embargo no hay la potencia de sus primeros trabajos. Si eres un seguidor del grupo puedes adquirir el disco, si lo estas escuchando por primera vez, busca una de sus trabajos anteriores para que sepas de que es capaz esta agrupación"
5,Excellent Album of New Material By the CGT,"For a while I felt like I couldn't go see the CGT again because they were playing mostly the sametunes they had been for years. Great stuff, but I was hoping for more new material. Now they have come out with this excellent, creative new effort. This isa great cd, a good one for old fans or for people who are just getting into the band. I'm so glad theyare creating great new sounds and playing so strongly. Can't wait to see them live next time they are around."
5,"Their best album, in my opinion","There's not a bad song on this album, and some of them rank among CGT's best work (e.g., ""The Marsh"".) I'll admit some bias, as I became a CGT fan shortly before Whitewater came out and saw them perform nearly all of it live. I like that most of the songs here are originals, but CGT is also known for some refreshing covers, and ""Ghost Riders on the Storm"" is an excellent example - a clever idea I haven't gotten tired of yet after a couple hundred listenings. I also highly recommend the albums Andromeda (all orginals) and Echoes (all covers), and I also like much of their older work."
5,California Gold Rush,"It must be an alien six armed guitar player!! Amazing musicality. Skip all the reviews and go listen to this group. Moneyback Guarantee: Any part of your money they haven't already spent,they will return to you! Seriously, listen very carefully. This is not New Age crapola,don't put this on while you are making dinner or puttering around the house or writing a blog....sit down in your best 5.1 surround system and lean back."
5,P.N. Elrod keeps the Vampire Files in High Gear,"In the latest installment in the vampire files, P.N. Elrod continues the enthralling story of Jack Fleming and his constant battle with coming to terms with his undead nature. Song in the Dark picks up shortly after Cold Streets. If you haven't been reading through the series you will want to go in order, each books builds on the previous book. In this story Jack is coming to terms with his near 2nd death experience and the impact it has had on dealing with a trauma so brutal and serious, that a normal person would not have lived through. The book starts off on a high point and keeps building from there; it will hold you on your seat till the very last page. This book shows a new aspect to being an Undead vampire, the extreme trauma and how someone deals with going on night after night, after facing a foe and situation that would destroy a normal person and even destroy an indestructible vampire."
4,"Dense, Enlightening, and Relevant","The book is dense, but well-written and very educational. Dr. Geisst wrote a wonderful history of Wall Street from its early days of the late 18th century until the mid 1990s. Most of the colorful movers and shaker that Wall Street has seen throughout history are here and their exploits are lucidly, if not grippingly, described. From Geisst's accurate historical narrative it becomes clear just how speculative and wild Wall Street had been, until the Depression era regulations. This book is valuable for anyone interested in U.S. history, financial history, and world economic history. Pick it up today."
4,Not really about Wall Street,"You should be aware that the title of this book (and its description) is misleading. It appears to be a history of Wall Street -- that is, a street in Manhattan and the area around it, but it is not. Instead it isa history of capitalism and business legislation in America. As such, it is a good book, and puts an interesting perspective on US history. If you are intersted in the history of New York City, this is not the book for you, but if you are interested in American business and economic history, this is a neat little book."
5,What a gifted musician!,"You can definitely relate to Scott's music. For example, his song ""Roadside Lullabye"" (regarding a single mother raising her son), and ""Good Man, Bad Thing"" (regarding an unfortunate drunk driving incident), certainly coincide with today's issues to which everyone can identify. His talented, experienced band members compliment his ""Americana"" musical style, and bring a full, strong sound to each song. Scott is a wonderful singer/songwriter, and his ""Hoosier Surf"" CD and ""Proving Grounds"" CD are both a ""must have"" in anyone's music collection."
3,Old album and sounds like it!,"I love Neil and bought this for the few songs I was not familiar with. In comparing the Brother Love's and Sweet Caroline with the mp3's I have already as 128 kbps files these 256 kbps files are ""muddy"". But for $1.99 it's worth it to hear You're So Sweet, Horseflies Keep Hanging Round Your Face. How did I ever miss that one?I appreciate that Amazon's download app works perfectly and loads these files into iTunes - with the beta Windows 7."
4,A must read for young adults...start off right!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book (educational tool) and very much appreciate that Gary recognizes the importance of reaching young adults with the message of finding direction and discipline at an early, pivitol stage in life. In addition, I find this to be an excellent ""refresher"" read for some of us not so young adults as well; where was this book when I was younger?. Sharing his best as drawn from his own life experiences provides insight into the significance of developing a foundation for future planning based on good fundamental values and the benefits of starting young. Read, learn and apply...get started early, get started right!"
4,Your Own Best Self,"I would recommend this book to young adults who are serious about planning a better future for themselves. The book contains valuable guidance for positive-futures-planning!As an educator, I think his in-person presentations are a valuable teaching tool and reinforcer of good fundamental values. I would suggest visiting the author's web sitewww.garypuckett.org/product.html"
4,"Excuse me teacher, I have a question?","Your Own Best Self is an excellent introduction to many critical topics confronting today's young adults. Many of the issues addressed in this book are often relegated to ancillary discussions in formal education, but surface as primary contributors to future successes. My hope is that Gary Puckett continues to drill down through future publications to further this instrumental educational process. Great book, would like to see more!"
5,LOVE the UpsideDown show,"I'm so excited and happy for my son - he's excited that now we have all the UpsideDown show videos here on my computer and we can view them anytime, because Nick Jr., runs it late. Best thing too, is that he can watch his most favorite one anytime."
5,Creative entertainment for kids (and adults!),"The Upside Down Show is one of the most creative educational shows for kids ever made, and I'm sorry that it's no longer in production. My grandchildren ages 2 through 6 absolutely love it, but the 9 year old still gets a kick out of it. And it's one that I can watch with them--never fails to make me chuckle. Plus it provides a great use for the old remotes from electronics that no longer work!"
4,My daughter loves this!,"Bought this for my daughter it arrived promptly and in excellent condition, she was so excited she was jumping up and down. Definately a hit. Just wish they'd made more of them."
2,Love the show but the DVDs are terrible!,"My kids love this show so I purchased the dvds for them a few months ago. They seemed to work well for a while but after a couple months, one of the dvds sheared in half. It was not cracked but literally peeled. I've never seen anything like it but chalked it up to bad luck. A couple months later, the other dvd did the exact same thing. Now my kids have no Upside Down Show dvds. They love the show but I don't want to waste money buying new dvds every few months. This has never happened with any other dvds that I have ever purchased before or since. Not recommended."
3,A Satire that is a murder story,"This book more than any of the others in Baxt's Hollywood series is satirical. It perfectly describes Miss Mae West as she was in the 30's - outrageous, campy and surprisingly generous. She was a very warm human being, and totally aware of what she was and what she wasn't. After all she created herself and marketed herself in a way that few actresses did in that day and age. In this book there are a series of murders of Mae West impersonators, and Detective Villon works with Mae to try to find the killer before the real Mae West became a victim. The crescendo builds up until it culminates in a bizarre Halloween party held at an infamous nightclub. More murders occur, but Mae manages to avoid it, and then gets ready to set up the denouement in the most curious place you'll ever find."
1,How to lose Your talent in 5 years.,"Nobody ever did explain Maren how special she was?This release is a miss.The freshness, the sensations of Her songs, what took you back to thedreams of your teens years have completely disappeared.Why did She wait for so long? She grew and her talentwas drying like a plant who receives the wrong care.Nothing special in the new songs.I wait for so long. I will miss her beautiful songs.She will never write again the music whose tonality, suggestion were so essential to the ""Crazy Beautiful"" movie.I think she was confident of the wrong persons for her career. She was too young."
1,What a shame,"I entirely enjoyed Gothic and Gothic 2. Gothic 3 does not follow in the footsteps of these games. The interface is worse the story is worse, it is overall a big step backwards. It is a shame to ruin a series as good as Gothic but that is what they have done, much as the new Star Wars movies have ruined that series. If you are a Gothic fan then wait until the price drops way down and then go ahead and buy Gothic 3. If you have have not played any of the Gothic games do not start with this one.Additionally, the game really is buggy. As other reviews have mentioned the game will freeze up from time to time and then there is always the random animal attacks through solid objects (walls and the like)."
2,Epilepsy Warning...,"This games is a throw back to the DOOM days. I remember DOOM not because I thought it was a great game, but because the first time I played it, it made me sick and puke because of the visual issue we have come to know from the Epilepsy Warning we see on most games now. If you feel yourself geting sick stop playing, your brain is having a mild seizure brought about by the way the visual cues are comming to you from game play.I had to unistall and can't play it. It might have been a fun game but not for me.Hail Flavius!"
1,"Whatever good you've heard, ignore it.","This game is awful.I put about two hours into it struggling to get my money's worth but had to resign to the fact that I'd rather watch paint dry.If you've ever heard/read someone compare it to Oblivion, they were wrong. Very wrong."
2,"fun at first, but tends to lose it's zing..","I am a big fan of open-world rpgs, and don't get me wrong Gothic 3 delivers that large world greatly, but it does have flaws that completely killed the gaming experience for me.The Good:Large open worldLoads of side quests to doKilling king Rhobar, King Zuben and Xardas was a blast with some nice lootExploring can pay off pretty wellThe Bad:The time it took out of my life to get the community patches to make the game playableThe game is so open that it is rather difficult to find what to doWhen you discover locations on your map it is not marked so you can easily forget how to get backEnemies are easy and predictable, unless you try to melee an ogre, it is so hard lolIf you go about and kill all three main leaders in the game you cannot beat it without cheatsThose are the things in this game that killed it for me, but hey its 7 bucks worth a shot eh?"
1,Do not buy this game yet,This game was released way too early obviously - I have 2 computers and on my main computer it was unplayable - it was so choppy moving around and it froze alot of times - I even updated my video card and tried everything but that did nothing - when I put the game on high quality not only was it very choppy it turned all the animals into black boxes as well.On my other computer I couldnt even play it I got a video card error and forced to restart and my computer told me it recovered from a serious error.I would wait on this game until their are patches that fix this unplayable game - I seriously can't understand how video game companies release games full of bugs that need to be fixed - I feel very bad for the people who don't have an online connection and can't download the patches needed to play it. Next time don't release a game unless it's ready to play!
1,save your money. . .dont make my mistake,"i've never written a review before, but this game was so bad i felt i had to speak up. this game has more bugs than my back yard. . .its horrible. when it wasnt freezing up it was crashing, when it wasnt crashing the screen would go blank and the game would just re-start; i couldnt even get out of the first village. i'm so disappointed in this game, dont make my mistake and waste your 40 bucks."
1,No Surprise,Won't work. No surprise. It's from the same group that released Stubbs The Zombie. Read those reviews. Notice a pattern?
2,A violation of one of the oldest rules in all of game creation,I've been playing video games since 1985 and the typical game is designed to run on current market systems not cutting edge market systems. I have a machine that was a year old - a P4 3.0Ghz with 1GB RAM and and a new 512MB Nvidia graphics card and this game would not run properly. I won't repeat what all the other reviews say but I will add that the game designers made a fatal error in designing a game that will probably only run on about 10 - 20% of consumer's computers. If you do not have a dual core processor with at least 2GB RAM on the motherboard forget about it! This game will probably end up ruining the Gothic franchise (which is sad since the first two games are good) and the design company - Pirhana Bytes. Purchase at your own risk.
1,shiny frisbee,"I cannot get this to work. I have installed this on two newer machines which well exceed the minimum requirements. One has an ATI card and one has nVidia. The installers and drivers are all up to date. When I buy a game, I expect to put it in my DVD drive and play it. This game requires you to have moderately advanced computer knowledge even to start the game, which I have yet to experience. If you enjoy becoming frustrated, then this is the game for you."
2,Good Game by too hungry on system resources,"Great graphics and a good story line following on from Gothic 2. Lots of ways to develop you character and follow the story line through BUT wouldn't suggest it for anyone that doesn't have a top spec machine. My machine meets all the requirements and easily plays similar games (e.g. Elder Scrolls Oblivion) but struggles a lot with Gothic 3. So my experince is of a slow loading and very laggy game on 3.2GHz, 1Gb Ram, 256 Graphics... even when I've set some of the detail of the Graphics lower). It's prone to crash every so often as well. So I'll put the game into storage and play it again when my technology has caught up."
4,This was fun,More of the same .. good play style and fun to see what they put NEW into this installment of the classic
1,So buggy you can't finish the missions. I finally gave up.,"I liked Gothic 1 and 2. I like this one too, except I can't complete the game because people important to the main missions can drop right off the map and you can't find them anymore. Once I was looking for some runes and the orc who had what i was looking for just disappeared and was nowhere to be found, thus I could not comlete the mission.I would recommend playing this game anyway because it is so much fun, but be prepared to get buggy because all the bugs will drive you crazy.It could have been a great game. Instead it is just a colossal failure."
5,A must read,"""Sometimes the Magic Works"" is an outstanding guide on how to live a spiritual life. It's remarkably practical and beautifully written. A must read for anyone interested in trusting their inner wisdom."" --Lynn Robinson, author of Compass of the Soul and Divine Intuition."
5,This is a Russian takeoff on the classic fable,"Taylor Bayard lived between 1825 and 1878. This volume includes his version of Beauty and the Beast: A Story of Old Russia, and several other tales. His story is unlike the classical fable. See my reviews of the version by an unknown author and the de Beaumont account. A rather vicious prince who is generally drunk and who moves about with a whip in hand terrorizes his serfs in Russian. He is the beast in the story, although Bayard does not use the term. His son, also a prince, falls in love with a beautiful woman and marries her. His father is furious. The story continues by showing how the beautiful wife wins over the beastly prince."
5,Season Two Hits the Target!,"Season Two of Sledge Hammer! lives up to the high quality of the first season. Part satire, part drama and all quality, there are plenty of laughs to be found in these episodes. The ingenious solution to season one's cliffhanger ending is merely the first salvo in a season-long comedy fest. My personal favorite is ""Last of the Red Hot Vampires,"" which features a nice tribute to Bela Lugosi. The hysterical audio commentaries from creator Alan Spencer also continue in this set and they alone are funnier than anything on the networks these days. The humor and quality of Sledge are even more relevant in today's society and clearly leave us all hoping for a Sledge Hammer! movie."
5,My Gun,You know the very first time I saw Sledge Hammer. He was the kind of Cop I would like to be. He talked to his gun. That made him right there my kind of Guy. When there was asniper up on the roof of the building. Builets flying all around him. He took out his gun and looked at it and said we will use something bigger. He open the back of his car and got out a rocket. He looked at the guy and said this will do. He aimed it at him and then fired it at the doors of the building. The whole building came down. He then said YEP I GOT HIM!!!!!!!!! Nothing better than him as a cop. he is my most favorite Cop there is. Harold.
5,An Old Car and A Girl,"Kerouac said that his hyperactive pal Neil Cassidy was happiest behind the wheel of an old car with a girl at his side.Now that everyone is broke again, perhaps we'll all slow down a bit, get back to some basics, like this album of timeless rock and roll music.What goes 'round, comes'round. I can only hope that 25 years later a band like The Morells will come along and make us simply smile, laugh and have a good time.If someone from RHINO reads this,please, get a hold of the band, the original masters, and reissue this album."
5,Very Good Baby Blanket,I bought this blanket as a gift for my new grand niece. It is a very good blanket complete with a baby sheep. The fact that it is made of natural fibers makes it an excellent choice.
5,Wonderful Lab Manual,"This is a wonderful text clear and concise, it explores the bulk of the basic lab techniques and procedures in molecular biology. This highly readable text builds on the cumulative experiences of some highly skilled academicians and researchers. Highly recommended for any molecular biology lab course or as a useful reference."
4,Deciding on the 6- or 12-inch models,"First off, I have been a high school percussion instructor for five years and I love Real Feel pads. I recommend the 12-inch model for anyone that is using a pad to practice marching technique. Yes, its heavier, but that weight is paid off in stability (on your lap or table) and the fact that it fits perfectly on a 14"" drum (standard snare)."
1,Woodwind and Brasswind,"I ordered this product as a Christmas gift. the company Woodwind and Brasswind is the Company Amazon has as the seller. 2 weeks after ordering it, they called to tell me that the item was backordered. This is totally unacceptable. I should have been notified immediately. I would never buy from this company again."
2,the firm Core Solutions,This c.d. has 3- 10 minute work-outs. The first 2 are so easy that I did not feel any soreness. I did start to feel something on the 3rd work-out. I wouldn't recommend it. A waste of money. I was hoping for a good hard workout. This certainly was a disappointment.
2,Classic is only one worth doing.,I got this DVD a little cheaper from Walmart for $10 but I wanted a supplement to go with my strength training and cardio...I just wanted something that would really work my abs...I found that my 30 day shred was much more effective. i even tried this AFTER my 30 day shred workout and only felt a real push on the Classic Abs segment...I really wish they would do more reps of each exercise...the idea is great but to really get a burn you need more reps. I felt like they tried to pack a lot of different exercises in and didn't spend enough time doing each one.Overall I was disappointed. I too was bugged by having to restart the player each segment...but you don't really move around too much so just keep the remote nearby and that solves that problem.I think the individual exercises are great but I'd rather do them on my own so I can do more reps with them.
2,Disappointed,"I love Alison and the Dangerous Curves tape....but this workout was not what I thought it would be. It was just not challenging enough. I did this tape after doing another cardio/sculpting tape and still felt as though I wasted my time. I recommend that you definitely do not use this tape as workout in itself, but only as a compliment to another tape at best.....even then you might be disappointed. I know I was."
1,Costume rip off,Don't be fooled by this misleading advertisement. This is not a Jedi Robe Costume. It is just the robe. And it's a cheap robe of very low quality and thin material.
2,Changed my mind (Great needle replacement),This was the exact replacement I needed for my turntable and was over $30 cheaper than others I saw online. It works great.*** Update - needle only lasted through 5 album plays.
3,Sanyo Stylus,"very hard to find, the perfect fit. it does the job it was meant to do. very satisfied with this product."
5,FOR A JEDI ARMY,The Figure is very nice but not really for posing because its just bending her knees the speeder is nice does not explode (as said) very nice though. This doesnt come with a lightsaber so just get general grevious' lightsabers. It would be nice if it were more for posing. 11th jedi figure!
5,Truth be told,"Woog has written a truly wonderful book. It is a direct back hand to the outrageous notion that there are no gay people in todays education. Through a series of interviews, Woog tells the story of gay students, teachers and educators who came out in school and have worked to educated others. America has this great notion that their schools are gay free, but this book slaps them all in the face. If your an educator, student, straight or gay, i think you'll find this book is filled with great insight and knowledge. No matter what sexuality you are."
2,School's Out,"I am a freshman at Macon State College, and I had to read this book for my education 2000 class. I though that this book was a little hard to read. I followed the book somewhat, but it took reading the passages at least twice to try to comprehend why the author was telling this particular story. I think that this book could be improved if it had fewer stories from other people and had more feedback from the author."
3,Not for Snow Sports,"I ordered this product hoping that I could use it as a snowboard jacket. I was excited to get it, but sad to say after tyring it on that I don't think its heavy duty enough for snowboarding. I read details elsewhere on Marmot products and this line is intended for other uses.The jacket however does look sharp and was definatley comfortable so if its just a winter jacket you're after, it'd be a great fit, but for snowsports, the zippers don't appear to be heavy duty or waterproof and I wouldn't want to break an expensive jacket."
2,Not much content,I thought I was buying a real book but this seems like a supplement to something. Not much content. Very disappointed
3,Good for a true beginner,Found for a teenager who is interested in cake decorating. A little more basic than what was expected but a good source for how tos.
3,You get what you pay for...kinda,"Note, this is a small booklet..not a book. It's maybe 6 inches tall by 4 inches wide and about 15 pages. The pages are in color.It's not bad but I would not pay more than $3 for it."
4,"Good, but simple, resource",I purchased this booklet to share with my 10 year old aspiring chef and it fit the bill perfectly. Shows how many decorating projects are done with easy to read and understand directions plus lots of pictures. Recommended resource for beginners of all ages!
5,Excellent if you're just starting out,"I bought this book at Walmart for 3 bucks. Its not very big, more like a booklet. However its very informative. It takes you through the steps of making the cake from start to finish with full color photos of each finished cake. I've already picked a few of the cakes to make for upcoming birthdays! Great bargain. Definitely pick it up if you're just getting started."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This product was a waste of time. I bought it for 3.99, which I thought was a good deal. Little did I realize it was just too good to be true... This is a small pamphlet-like booklet that is the equivalent of something you would get free with a cake decorating kit or something. I bought this as a gift for my sister who just started to decorate cakes, and am so embarrassed... I don't even know if I can give it to her..."
3,Bad instructions and missing screws,"The instructions had been xeroxed so many times, you could not read part of the picture diagram in the upper right hand corner where it told you where the screws went into the frame. It was also missing some parts (screws). Luckily, I had someone of above average IQ and mechanically inclined with me to figure out how to assemble it in less than a hour. The quality is good, but needs another coat of wood protectant."
3,Pretty decent but far from their best effort.,"This album to me is more like the soundtrack for lord of the rings, it has that truly unique style of the 14th centry with some narrations and some interludes. I picked this album up at my local best buy thinking that this is one of their best albums everyone was talking about but I was probably mistaken that with their other album dawn of victory. This album has too much of their cheesy LOTR style of narrations and theater acting which I fast foward trying to find their metal but to me it's more less of what im hearing. If these guys want to put that style in their music fine but they should add more of their metal instead, but atleast it wasn't as bad as manowars last failure album gods of war which I truly regret buying.But this album was pretty good and if your a true power metal fan or a rhapsody fan don't let the negative reviewers or mine discourage you from buying this, it's not their best but it's really good."
2,Perhaps too much of what I expected,"I purchased the first Symphony of Enchanted Lands along with Unholy Warcry. I liked them enough that I decided to get what was at the time Rhapsody's latest offering. I knew full well what I was getting into: cheesy dialogue, over-the-top vocals, and fast guiter wankery.Well, when I was able to give this album a listen, I was disappointed.My main gripe with SoEL II is the amount of dialogue, which I guess isn't so bad, but I grew bored of it by my third listen to the album. I ended up ripping each track and creating my own CD with select songs from this album.The music itself is enjoyable, especially if you're already a fan of Rhapsody. However, this album was just not to my liking."
2,Unholy Cry,"I can't believe I wasted 16 quid on this. My friends and myself, who are massive fans of symphonic metal, think that Rhapsody are seriously begining to rust. I prefere Luca's ""Prophet Of The Last Eclipse"" to this.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of Christopher Lee's appearance here, it's just hilarious. Also the only song I like is ""Unholy Warcry"", it is faster and less boring than the rest of the album, and ""Elgard's Green Valleys"" is simply a breath of fresh air.I brought my copy with me when I went to France and just wasn't bothered to bring it back. Still it's a good thing I didn't get the Limited Edition which cost even more.Try some of Luca's solo albums instead."
1,What a disappointment...,"Ah, my dear Rhapsody, YOUR GOING DOWN THE DRAIN! I really did not like this album at all, I think that the quality has decreased a lot since their last and best album, Power of the Dragon Flame. That is the one you should buy, not this lousy piece of junk!. I don't like Christopher Lee's appearence AT ALL, because it feels much obliguied, it's like: ""Oh, our album is so bad that we better put ""Saruman"" to do some talking so we can sell something at all"". Later...""Oh, I don't like ""Saruman's appearence, but lets release it, people will buy it anyway"". I honestly tell you, there are MUCH better power metal albums then this crap (...)"
1,Break out a cloak and multi-sided dice!,"Not what I expected at all. Im open to all kinds of music and decided to try out this band due to the reviews mostly. Im a long time Manowar fan and since I bought some of their stuff on here, I kept getting this band popping up on the recommedations. The ""power metal"" tag that has been touted lately. All the reviews made it quite tempting so I went for it. NOT the type of attitude or raw power that Manowar has. This reminds me of maybe Helloween meets Rush. This music doesn't inspire me to do anything, other than put on a purple cloak, play with some multi-sided dice and go on and on about my 12th level wizard. Maybe big with the Jr High crowd, for us adults stay away."
1,Déjà Vu,"This release is surprisingly redundant, Rhapsody amazingly cloned their previous songs like never before. Okay, we know it happens a lot with many bands, but this time things have gone beyond the limit. We can find Emerald Sword, Forest Of The Unicorns and other older songs mixed in a so-called ""new album"". It sounds like a disrespect."
2,wouldn't buy again,"I wouldn't buy this product again, are dog isn't even that bad of a chewer. In a mater of of 15 min. she was getting pieces off it."
5,When Lovers Unite,"This album is created beautifully. The lyrics take you to new dimensions, and it is well worth listening to.It is especially good for those who are in love, or are falling in love with a new snag!!So listen to this album with the love of your life...I am a person who loves round dance love songs and 49 songs, and if you are too, you will absolutely love this album.Thanks Common Man Singers for creating this album."
2,Great Concept - poor writing!,"I was really excited to receive this book... however, I've had a difficult time enjoying reading it. The run-on sentences, poor grammer, and loose sentence structure are so distracting, that as a reader, you loose interest. I spent more time editing in my mind, then pulling together what the author was saying. Rather long-winded, I kept having the feeling of ""let's get to the point."" On a positive note, there are some fun pictures and the author does string together some interesting concepts. Personally, I just couldn't get past the writing. Summary - although interesting, don't expect concise writing."
5,A good update on the state of biblical archaeology,"This little tome is a good update to Joseph Free's 'Archaeology and Bible History'.The author does a good job of presenting the finds with the liberal and conservative viewpoint. He is definitely conservative and believes in the inerrancy of Scripture, but is very wise to warn those of us in the field of apologetics not to make rash statements of how 'archaeology proves the Bible' or go too far in stating what the evidence we do have acutally proves.I finished the book hoping that an update would soon appear, and wishing there was some way to increase funding for the worthwhile endeavor of archaeology. What an exciting job to have!This book is technical but readable, accurate and realistic, and much too short. I highly recommend it."
3,good read,"I read this book quite a while ago and remember that it was a good read. One impression I had was that the writer doesn't point out the obvious: Prior to the time of the Kings, there is a virtual dirth of evidence for anything. For example, in the chapter on the Exodus, after sifting through all of the dialogue, you come to realize that millions of pre-Israelites spent forty years in the desert and there is not a potsherd of evidence. At the end of the chapter, the author all but admits this. I realize that absence of evidence is not usually evidence of absence, but when you should expect to find evidence and you don't, well... To add some balance to what I've just said, this book was written in 1997 and I think that more evidence has emerged since then.The chapter on Sodom was interesting, but full of speculation.Read this book and enjoy it, but be sure to read what isn't said."
2,Funky but cheap,The glass tubes are wider than they might seem from the picture and hold a good amount. The rack is not space demanding and can easily be mounted on a wall. I ordered through Chef Tools. Their delivery was impressively fast and the item was so well packaged that the USPS could have used it as a football and it wouldn't have been damaged.The two negatives are 1) it does not come with labels 2) the rack is cheap and the coating flakes off.
3,Adorable and low quality,"I love this item. I am a microbiologist, and test tubes in the kitchen - LOVE IT! I gave the product 3 stars because 1) it doesn't come with labels, so you have to make your own. 2) one of the test tubes came cracked. Still usable, but you can't replace just one test tube... you have to buy a box of 200 if you're looking to get new ones on your own. The test tubes are low quality glass and break easily. All that being said, the scientist in me absolutely loves this spice rack and would buy it again. And if you don't have enough spices to fill all the tubes, you can do shots!"
4,Perfect for what I wanted,"I didn't use this as a spice rack, I used it to make my boyfriend (who loves chemistry) a gift. That being said, this product seems to be very durable for what the real use is for. The tubes are thickish glass and the corks slide in and out smoothly without being too loose. There are two places for nails so that you can hang it on the wall, but it also stands on it's own fine. If you're looking for a fun way to store your spices, this is the right product for you."
4,"AWESOME,The Story of My Roots.",This book is written in a very simple way.It is very touching and shows the fiber that our pioneer ancestors were made of. It allows me to KNOW the grandfather that I never met. We need more books like this.
3,Interesting step back in time.,"A short read. Written in simple language, but a good brief insight into this wild country at the time. I would have liked a more detailed or in-depth writing."
3,"Very nice, but gets heavy","I really like this bag, and after 1.5 years of constant use it still looks good (although it has worn through the padding where it hits my hip). No complaints about quality, and all the organization pockets are great.But: I find it too heavy to carry comfortably when it's loaded up (my large laptop, a textbook, lunch)...the strap cuts into my shoulder quite a bit. Also annoying is that where it hits my hip, all my jeans have become somewhat worn. However, this might just be a problem with most messenger bags, not this one specifically. This is the only one I've ever bought, and when it dies I will go back to a trusty old backpack."
1,Deceitful,"Being LDS, I found the book deceitful and obnoxious. This is an anti-mormon book and should be so advertised as such instead of it's trickery title."
3,"Good software, bad support","The features of the software are great. For people who make extended use of Outlook categories and subfolders, being able to carry those into the Palm is invaluable.Support, though, is lousy. I had occasion to try when I started getting an ""unexpected error"" on synching my contacts which corrupted by home PC's Outlook contacts. The access to email support is hidden in web pages, only showing up once the user has browsed limited and un-helpful FAQs. I never was able to find a telephone number for support. And, despite claims on that response should be forthcoming by next business day, I've been waiting a week now with no response."
4,Peoples of a Spacious Land,"I bought Peoples of a Spacious Land for my history travel program at EMU, the book was in pretty good condition other than having some highlighting from a previous student. The travel class is graduate level and the quality of the work certainly matches it."
4,If you love fairytales you'll just love this,"I really enjoyed reading this. The characters are lovely, you really get into the 13 tales included in the book. It really appeals to your dreams, a book that sort of grabs on to your soul and doesn't let go. Ever get that feeling? Well, this book appealed to my soft side, like a classic fairytale book you always like to return to. I couldn't put it down. The three writers are very talented. A recomendation: Don't start reading this at night if you plan to wake up early the next day. You'll be up until you finish it. A must for all fantasy and fairytale lovers!! I only don't give it five stars so that you can read it and then say: ""Why didn't she give it 5 stars? It's well worth it."" Ah, I made you want to read it! What are you waiting for??? READ IT!!!Millennia"
2,LINERS,THESE ARE OKAY FOR HOLDING IN THE MOISTURE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER BUT ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO OPEN UP.
4,Plastic Liners,What can one say? These are ordinary plastic liners for hands or feet. They are as advertised.The order was processed and shipped quickly.
5,I Love these!,1st of all ..... above and beyond a great product not too big for hands and not too small for feet. They are PERFECT! 2nd... You will NOT find this product for a better price or better quality. I have searched for a great deal because I buy them for my class out of my own pocket. I will be ording these for every one of my Hydrotherapy classes. 3rd ..... Arrived 6 days before the estimated delivery date!!! I need all my items shipped in a timely manner (before my class start date) This was super FAST. Every aspect of the product and seller is GREAT! Will be buying again soon !
4,Liners for Wax Therapy,These liners are just right for using on your hands for hot wax therapy. They are a little small for using on the feet.
3,what can you say about a bag?,That they were new? clean? packaged nicely? See through? decently priced? I mean really! There just isn't a lot I can brag about here folks.
1,picture misleading,The Amazon picture indicated the door and back of the mailbox was white. The box I got was black. I ordered it expecting it to be white. I would not have ordered it if l had known it was black.
2,Not the right book if you're looking to admire what's going on in the womb,"So if you're an expectant individual looking to really admire the MIRACLE of the process, you won't find that in this book.The word EVOLUTION is mentioned all the time: how this part of growing fetus witnesses our monkey roots, and that part makes us very similar to fruit flies... This robs the reading of the feelings of divinity, magic or God's plan.Constant references to fetal abnormalities. For instance, the author is explaining how a certain tube closes up in a growing fetus - and there is the obligatory addition that ""well, if it doesn't close right, the baby will have this and that sickness"", etc. 30% of the book is about what can go wrong.Buy this if you want a very cold-bloodied, level-headed, ""no-miracle"" outlook on the ""process"".The book is informative."
3,"OMG, my bill is killing me!","Ok, so AT&T; has the iPhone. That may be the only reason for keeping my plan. The service is average at best. The least dropped calls ........... HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.I could just go on. Well, if you really have to have AT&T; you should buy more minutes! DONT GO OVER! Buy more minutes for your family plan even if you are not sure you will need them. OK kids, end of lecture!"
1,no support,"After buying the game and installing on to my Computer (newer) was unable to get the game to run, did not accept the settings for my version of Windows (vista) searching the web i found no support, bothe ""Monte Cristo"", and "" 03 "", web sites have shut down, no fixes available, installed the lattest patch i could find 2.16, still did not work, might work on a older computer."
5,Amazing Performance,"This is a wonderful documentary of the 77-Drummer Boadrum musical phenomenon that took place on 7-7-07. This music thrills my soul. I find it to be sacred music of the highest order. I hope they make an album of the performance, but this will do for now. The Boredoms are very spiritual, intelligent, kind, humorous, creative and loving seeming people, and this comes across in the music. So glad this dvd is out, HIGHLY recommended."
2,"ok, but incomleate","as title says, the prodact is fine but you need more parts to mount on your bike, therefore I had to bay unother mount and from this one used just a cord. Hope this would help."
2,Garmin motorcycle mount,"I purchased this mounting kit to quickly attach my gps to my Harley Davidson for travel. The kit is misleading as a ""mounting kit"". It does hold the unit somewhat securely, although i have added extra protection to prevent detachment from the bracket during travel. It does not have the hardware needed to attach to the handle bars. Therefore additional products must be purchased. What is called a ""ram kit"" which is sold at other vendors online is required. costs are about $35 to $50 bucks. I felt deceived when i purchased it as a ""mounting kit"" and was unable to initially mount it to my bike."
3,Good product but incomplete,"This is really not a mounting kit so much as it is a cradle for the 2610. I went crazy trying to find a ram kit, so I could actually mount this thing on my motorcycle. The Garmin instructions aren't helpful in this regard but I finally found a 2.5"" round plate with a 1"" ball attached which would fit the Garmin backing plate. The popular diamond plate won't fit. I actually had to get hold of a schematic of the part to match it up. Problem solved. But this whole process should have been more customer friendly. The 2610 is a great product, but if you're not a techie, you might want to consider buying some other mount package specific to the 2610."
2,Doesn't include everything...,"This is just a mounting kit... It needs a 3rd party ""cell phone"" mount to actually attach to your motorcycle. Very disappointed that I have to order something *else* in addition to this ""kit""After getting a RAM mount (from somewhere else, I don't think Amazon sells them), this did mount easily and quickly to my bike, just be aware, that you need a RAM mount in addition to this kit, which is really just a connection from a RAM mount to the garmin device"
1,Garmin Motorcycle Mounting Kit,The price was okay but the unit was not very good from a mounting standpoint. I had to replace it with a RAM unit. I cannot recommed this product.
1,Save your money,"This DVD is essentially the same as the narrator/demonstrator's other Hawaiian Massage for Women video. The difference is that he is showing a married couple how to perform Lomi Lomi massage. The husband is a body-builder type who is cuter than the guy teaching him the techniques.The sound quality is awful. When the wife/model says something to the two guys you cannot hear a word she speaks. The camera stays pretty much stationary throughout.The setting, unlike the other video, is indoors.If you are interested in Lomi Lomi massage techniques, buy a different video."
4,Very pretty,Purchased for my 14-year old & she loves it. Nice and dainty. I would also wear it out as a nice piece.
4,very cute.,well worth the purchase. please with looks and quality. The beads are a bit rough on the skin so if you have sensitive skin this may not be the purchase for you.
1,Not happy with this purchase,"This bracelet looked so delicate and elegant on the website, but when it arrived it looked tacky, tacky, tacky. I haven't worn the bracelet yet, and when I took it out to wear it a few days ago, it had already tarnished! Unfortunately, I'm already past the window of time in which I can get a full refund. I'm not pleased with the quality or look of this bracelet. Very disappointed."
1,How can I telll it is Swarovski Crystal?,I don't know why they call it Swarovski Crystal. There is no brand on the bracelet. The so called silver is unpleasantly coarse and rough to the touch. I don't' like it at all.
2,beautiful beads but length for BIG wrists,"I'll need to change the clasps on these to a lobster claw; the size on these is huge because the kind of clasps used gives the bracelet (must be) an extra 1/2"" or so. So, it will not hang JUST loosely on my wrist; it slides all the way to the middle of my palm. And my hands are not small; I have average-size hands. I was very close to returning the item until I thought of the lobster claw modification, which is a great idea because it'd be a shame to have to return a sparkly bracelet that looks so nice."
4,What you pay is what you get,"The monitor(not a TV; it has no tuner) is fine with a satellite service which precludes your TV tuner anyway. It had a small hiccup(flaw) for a few days; by the time customer service called, it had mysteriously cured itself. Like computers, today's TV's sometimes just need the power strip turned off for a re-set. Anyway, the price was excellent, the picture comparable to any other, the weight extraordinary(light) for a 37"" set, etc. Plus, it can serve as a giant(37"") computer monitor. Only shortcomings are speed of service and no p-i-p."
4,compelling story continues,"The first book in the third volume of Powell's monumental series (Book 1 of Autumn).You could almost start with this one.World War II begins, with many new characters interacting with Jenkins less than stellar military positions. No battles, rather life in camps with training exercises and political intrigue. Widermpool returns near the end as an officer rising in the ranks."
4,Good for Shah Rukh Khan fans,"I bought this because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan. This story has some elements which remind me a little of the Broadway musical ""Annie"". I liked the scenes when Shah Rukh Khan was in the film. I missed seeing Shah Rukh Khan during the big chunks of time he was not in the scenes. This film is worth getting if you are a serious fan of Shah Rukh Khan."
3,The Broken Sky DVD,"It was an interesting storyline but not very clear and was having to concentrate on what was occurring. Okay, but may have bought something else."
3,did not like sub titles,"it had sub titles and the were so quick to read, it was a ok movie again he lost the love of his life"
3,"A bit long. But still very sexy, sensual and filled with romantic angst.",I like this film. its so cool how there is almost no dialogue everything is conveyed through acting. Some things are a bit repetitive. Could have used more editing. A bit long.
2,Very confusing,"Some might say that movies with little dialogue are interesting and artistic but I disagree. I was confused almost right from the get-go. I had no idea what was going on and I couldn't even figure out who the main characters were. The movie is kind of slow moving and a lot goes on but very little is explained. I wouldn't really suggest this movie unless you are one of those people who have laser-focused attention. I do not, especially when I'm at home. I do have to give props though, as the story is a very good idea."
2,I didn't like it,"I didn't like it. I'm not saying it's horrible, because obviously by the other reviews some people really liked it. but just for me, I couldn't handle that there was hardly any dialog. Or that the dialog wasn't in English. I personally don't like reading subtitles. It was kinda pornographic in the sex department. Could be a good or bad thing depending on what you like. I don't like that."
1,Slow with so many similar scenes,"The whole movie can be summarized in 10 minutes. The characters barely speak, and it made me fall asleep in the middle of the movie. No storyline either."
2,Yawn...,"I'm giving two stars solely for the great cinematography. Otherwise, this is waste of over two hours. It's the simple story of an on-again-off-again romance between two college boys, one of whom is unwilling to commit. It's devoid of dialogue for the most part and it goes absolutely nowhere. Scene after scene of...well...nothing. The plot, such as it is, flashes back and forth to no real effect. It seems too much an attempt to be artsy and falls flat there as well. Thankfully, there was enough good camera work, lighting, etc. to keep me interested, but only visually. Two+ hours was just too much, though."
1,don't waist you money,"this movie is very boring, in the 2hr and 10 min the actors only have about 5 lines that they speek. this is a very slow movie."
1,Total Waste of Money and Time,"No starts would be appropriate. Broken Sky is one of the worst excuses for a movie I've ever seen. Basically, it is a tedious mess. Almost no dialog, only commentary; when there is dialog, the lips don't match the dialog. It's at least an hour too long. The film ultimately reflects nothing. You keep watching, thinking SOMETHING meaningful is going to happen -- it never does. You feel like slapping the entire cast while telling them all to get a life. I can't recall when I've seen such a tired excuse for a movie. I've seen many gay films -- this wouldn't so much as qualify for a bad home movie. Save you $$."
4,Really quiets things down,This drum mute works well. We have a group of guys that play together and the snare drum was over powering everyone. This pad equalizes the volumne with everyone and can easily be removed for songs that use brushes.
3,barely use it,"It's cute, but I found that using a regular cotton clothes to brush my baby's teeth is more convient for me."
2,Didnt work for us,"We were really hoping this would do the trick, but our son didn't let us stick it in his mouth....Also, I would not recommend this to a baby that has molars already, its too soft, its bast for the first couple of teeth and to massage the gums."
1,The only thing which is worse than this book is SQL Server 7,"Having some previous SQL knowledge (Oracle) I find this book annoying, insulting and worthless. My head is full of questions as I learn this new database and this book answers none of them.For example, during the installation process, where you can set some database parameters which are very hard to change back, instead of giving you any information to help you make your choice, the book simply tells you to ""Make sure you choose carefully"". Thanks a ton.Additionally, the page layouts are quite bad and they don't use any subsections which makes skimming for information very difficult."
3,Mantis areator attachement not compatible wth all lawns,"A word of caution to homeowners with St. Augustine, Centipede, Zoysia or Bermuda type turf. Because these lawns have horizontal runners (roots) that are close to the surface and the Mantis areator is of the slit cutting type areator, it is not recommended for these types lawns. I contacted Mantis customer service about their areator since I have St Augustine turf and they said that the slit type areator is not compatible with grasses that have horizontal runners. So if you have turf with horizontal runners such as those noted above you will need to get or rent a plug style areator. I still might buy the dethatcher but I will pass on this combination kit with the areator."
5,Awesome,I love the video hound books. Lots of information. Like a complete movie encyclopedia. I love to give this as a gift with movie tickets and popcorn. My only complaint is that it gets out dated every time they release a new movie.
4,Cool,"I read this when I was 10 years old and I found it amazing. I recommened it to a lot of my friends and they liked it as well. The part about Grinny's bone was so cool. It was amazing....really. It was like something out of a movie. A really good book, so good I've read it again and again."
3,This was on CBS STORYBREAK,"I never got to see a copy of this book. However, I saw ""Grinny"" as a 1/2 hour cartoon special on that old Saturday morning tv series ""CBS Storybreak"". (I think ABC still has their books-made-into tv specials series.) Every Saturday morning, there would be a book made into and animation."
5,Brilliant!,The book was exactly what I ordered and expected. It was here exactly when they said it would be and I would recomend this supplier
5,YUMMMMM!!!!!,"Hard to find on the mainland, but a wonderful, refreshing flavor of Mentos. Worth the purchase!"
2,Boring and sloppy,"Ok, Stansberry has a seed of an idea in this book, but that is about all. He develops it poorly. The mystery is impossibly contrived and long before midway becomes a tedious bore. Furthermore, despite its title it has nothing to do with Mussolini; it's set in San Francisco, but the geography is only occasionally correct, and it deals with Italians but misspells nearly every Italian name. Don't writers, to say nothing of editors, bother checking any more? How this ever won an award is beyond me. If it were a school creative writing report, it would barely get a passing grade."
1,Don't waste your time reading this one!,I purchased this because it won an award. So much for awards...This novel fits into no recognized genre. It is NOT a thriller! The only mystery is why it received an award. Perhaps it is a romance. I HATED it!.
1,HORRIBLE!...doesn't even deserve the one star!,this camera is the biggest rip off camera you could possibly buy... DONT DO IT!
3,Love's not always by design!!,"I am so sad when a book does not pull me into its world! This book was one of those kinds. The book started out good but slowly started to lose my attention. This was my first book by Sanders, but I'm not turning my back on her because she writes well and I can see some potential!!"
4,Superb Book..... Well worth the time and Money,"As a mechanical engineer with nearly 30 years of process equipment experience, I find this book invaluable for the design, specification and operation of storage facilities.Meyers has a well organized, informative text with an easy to find index. The book is particularly useful where the pros and cons of design alternatives are compared. I have seen heated discussions resoved based on Meyer's recommendations.As anyone who has delt with tank design over the past several years can tell you, design practices, recollections and anecdotes, combined with the occasional company guideline were the only references available. Now Meyers comes forth with an authoritative text that fills a long standing need.Purchase this book along with the Aboveground Steel Storage Tank Handbook by Brian Digrado and you have (virtually) everything important that has been written about aboveground storage tanks."
2,Above Ground Storage Tanks,"Although the book is informative, I was disapointed as it does not give much information regarding design methods. ie tank roofs etc"
2,"Above Ground Storage Tanks, by Philip E. Myers","I expected more for process engineer such as selection basis and sizing basis and guide line for each tanks advantage and disadvantages, which was not completely covered.This is book for Mech, enggs"
5,a great book,I was given this book for Christmas from my granddaughters who bought the book from the author at the Oregon State Fair and it is an autographed copy to me. I had a hard time putting the book down and participating in other activities during 'Christmas. It is very well written and has plots coming from different directions that tie very well together. I have been interested in the history of the orphan trains so this added an interest for me and being a resident of Idaho I learned some other items concerning Idaho history.
4,Kept me wanting to know what next,"I enjoyed this book and would recommend it. I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next, but there were times it was predictable. Overall, I liked this book."
4,Great book!,"This is a wonderful book with great use of characterization. I had a hard time putting it down, coming to the end of a chapter and not being able to resist the temptation to continue to find out ""what happens next."" I found the story line entertaining and had no trouble visualizing the characters and identifying with them. This is a very fine contribution to the literary world by a very excellent young writer."
5,Awesome Movie,"Raju is a wonderful film with a good story line and talented actors like Shah Rukh, Juhi and Nana. The movie is entertaining, heart warming and a must see. Shah Rukh in one of his earliest movie roles is at his best like usual! Songs are nice and you will enjoy this one!"
2,"Sudoku ""Mega Screen""","The screen can not be read properly in ""day light"" even with the back light turned on - NOT what I expected!!!!!!!"
3,some good ideas,"Even though this book wasn't the greatest it did have some good ideas. A lot of it, however, was common sense advice. The one thing I didn't care for is the section for grooms was only a few pages long, as if the grooms don't have more to do than what she listed. If any duties were mentioned for the groom in the beginning the duty was put onto the bride, i.e. she says for the bride to make sure the shoes fit comfortably on the groom. Stuff like that the groom, as an adult, can do himself. I don't recommend this book though. There's better ones out there."
1,Preachy and poorly constructed,This book is a mish-mash of preachy and poorly constructed misguided phrases from an author that is not even a bridal consultant. There were no visuals and not really any good ideas. I would not recommend this book.
1,Smells terrible,I bought this for myself because I'm a poto phan girl and it smelled like it was a stale dollar store perfume ugh I'm only keeping It because it says phantom that's it. It smells terrible
4,This is Book Three!!,"Don't do like me. This is only 1 of 4 books. To really know what is going on, you need to read the first 2 first. Why? Because, at the end, they leave it hanging and say ""To Be Continued"". Instead of making one big book, they broke it up into 4 parts. Now I need to buy the first 2 parts and then the last. Other than that it was a good book."
5,best usb key,"8GB in my pocket all the time. At this price and with very good performance, it is the best usb key you can buy. The design is cool as usual with LaCie. The product is plug and play. The price is buy and play. I love and show it everywhere. I brind back more mp3 or video everyday. It is not another storage but a MUST in your pocket."
2,5 Great Months - RIP,"This is a great product as long as you backup your data WEEKLY (or more often). I became a little comfortable and lazy and didn't backup for 6 weeks and lost any new data when the drive suddenly, after 5 months just stopped working. Reviewing online it seems to be fairly common experience - 3 months to 1 year drive failure."
3,"Intel, blah","I had an old computer lying around, then I got custody of my grandson. Now he his mackin' that he has his own computer. Threw out the Celeron processor that was in it, put a faster and better chip in there. Great shipping, nice and safe. Figure it would give another year or 2 left on the computer, since he isn't playing Crysis or doing anything hard other than watching online cartoons and playing at nick or Disney. Just for the love of God, DO NOT forget to use thermal paste or your chip will cook in seconds."
3,pentium 4,I had a 2.4gh and my computer was kind of clunkish so i bought a 2.8gh pentium 4 and now the machine is not clunky anymore it is working like i bought a new machine.
5,Great value,"Very stylish, cleans up well with silver polishing cloth, still looks brand new. Quick delivery and good quality."
5,"Consitancy, Communication and Success","Having seen several development programs from different perspectives, user's, requirements analyst's, tester's and program budget manager's, I know that the process is never perfect and never identical. However, this book, with its clear guidelines and principles, give an excellent framework for consistently developing quality software on-time and within budget. A mature development process can take an organization years to achieve. Donaldson and Siegel give new and old users, devlopers and program managers a great foundation to build upon. The book is very clear in its processes and provides ample justification for taking the steps to consistantly develop quality software, meet your client's expectations and build the positive reputation we all seek."
3,Its ok but sounds just like Thursday,"Yea uh, my friend recommended this album, I think he knows them locally in Arizona, my first thought wow this sounds like thursday. I am a big fan of thursday, i bought the cd listened to all the songs, yea, just like thursday, not as good, but not bad. You could call it a rip off but a lot of bands sound a like these days, so I guess if ur a fan of thursday you will like these kids."
3,Fair,"I will agree, there is a strong resemblence between the Thursday song and Loose Lips Sink Ships. Almost eerie. But it sounds decent."
1,"Hawthorne Heights, but worse(if that's possible)","This is probably the worst ""emocore"" album that I've ever heard, and, yes, the riff off of ""loose lips sink ships"" is a complete ripoff of thursday's ""cross out the eyes"", but to put both of those band names in the same sentence is a sin. I'm a fan of emo/hardcore, but this is a pathetic attempt to fall into that genre. If you want real emo/hardcore please see the aforementioned thursday. that's what real music is. Also check out thrice, underoath, dredg... hell... i'd rather you listen to my chemical romance than this sh**"
5,there is a difference between these guys and thursday,"theres a small difference between thursday and a change of pace....and that bein the fact that thursday sucks left nut...dont care for em at all....picked up this cd expectin them to suck much like thursday and was suprised...they are very good....i had ""Goodbye for Now"" on repeat for a while...deff gonna melt this cd by playin it so much"
4,tears,rock like no other. during a time when emo was mocked these guys kicked ass. this cd will convert you
2,Nothing new,"I bought this C.D. on the suggestion of a store clerkIt's just okay; with a few good momentsAnd that's all it can ever aspire to beThe first song does rip the guitar intro to ""Cross Out The Eyes"" by Thursday, and it dosen't go in any big direction after thatMy suggestion, go listen to ThursdayOr Underoath, Taking Back Sunday, Chiodos, Circa Survive, Say Anything, Saves The Day, or Fall Out BoyAll bands that actually mean something or have good ideas"
5,Must Buy!,"It's been a while since I have been able to buy a cd and listen to the whole album through. This band is amazing, I recommend anyone who listens to bands like, matchbook romance, Thrice, etc. to add this to their collection. Their energy is up there in the top, and I would not listen to the bad reviews, that person who compared this band to Thursday does'nt have a clue lol. These guys dont have one thing in common with them besides the screaming, I would say the lead singer has more of a Midtown/ Pop punk edge with screamin, which I would of never thought could sound this good. Anyways buy this album, my favirote songs are loose lips sinks ships, and asleep at the wheel."
5,On to something good!!!! *****,These guys are trying something a little different and it seems they are on to something good! Talk about guys that can find the good in anything. Here they are! Rise of the Underdog! A definate must see and it's super cheap! Why not?
5,Amazing tabletop art,This was sent to us as a gift and is absolutely amazing. Each page is a beautiful work of art. Perfect for any table top not to mention a great conversation piece.
5,Sabuda DAZZLES again!,Robert Sabuda's new tribute to AMERICA in pop-up form is simply gorgeous. A perfect gift for that adult kid in all of us. We have been collecting all of his pop-up's and the designs continue to amaze and thrill us.
2,Such a disappointment,"Purple mountains' majesty? How about plain white mountains? Including Mt. Rushmore with no faces printed on it.And if all white is such a great idea, then why is the very first image, of the Golden Gate Bridge, in color? I swore the following pages were a printing error.Very disappointing."
3,"good, but disappointing","Agree with a couple of the other posters. This is a great idea/theme, and the pop-ups are, as usual, very intricate, but the lack of color is very disappointing. This doesn't compare to his other books."
5,This book should have been a Caldecott for sure!,"With America The Beautiful's lovely pop-ups and beautiful cover, I can't believe anyone would choose anything else. Robert Sabuda is an excellent illustrator and he's great with pop-ups. If you look closely at the pop-ups, you'll notice that the pop-ups are strained so they're tugged upwards. He does miniscule details such as water moving and a boats wheels turning, all with pop-ups. His illustrations are great for all ages. I would recommend this book for a parent-child read aloud. Kids will love it. I'm a kid myself, so I should know! -Kathryn"
2,"Beautiful, imaginative...but messy",Hard to keep kid's attention with page turning and unfocused pop ups which are easily damaged. Pop ups need color to differentiate the text themes. Would be better with video or DVD format.
5,Metaphorically intriguing,"I tend to gaze upon ""prophetic words"" with much apprehension and scrutiny. This book, would be just as intriguing, however, if it were read based on its metaphorical content alone. This book is an elaborate version of ""The Pilgrim's Progress"". It is challenging, focused and continually points the reader to Jesus. Masterfully written, yet with ""the cloak of humility"". When reading it, do as the scriptures entreat us, ""study and show yourselves approved"". Take it to the Lord and ask Him to show you if it is truth or heresy."
5,If you have ears to ear hear what the Spirit is saying...,"This book along with several others God has used to encourage me on my own spiritual faith journey. God used this book in a time when I felt no one around me understood the path I was on. It was a path of brokeness and despair but I chose to believe I was on this journey climbing up the mountain! If you are seeking to KNOW HIM, Jesus, and feel like you are all alone. I encourage you to read this book. Ask the Spirit to minister to you His truth. Lay aside what you do not understand and drink in what brings life to you!"
4,reread this every year!,"Although it was a bit confusing at first, I realized the depth of what Rick Joyner was stating. We as christians need to study the word and have the scales fall from our eyes and see what the enemy is really trying to do to us! And what he is trying to get us to do to each other; division, strife and hatred toward each other rather than seeing our differences as strengths. Doctrine will always be different in each church but we are all His children and should love each other and stand together."
5,A must read for all Christians!,"This is a fantastic book! It literally changed the way I look at life. Touching, inspiring and it gives you a lot of food for thought."
4,a lot to think about,a lot to think about in how evil spirits control usI can see all this going on right now in the church I belong to
5,"Rick Joyner's ""Final Quest""",This is an inspiringly great book for all Christians and those looking at Christianity. A prophetic vision where Rick got to meet great Godly characters of the past after having experienced the love of being in God's judgement seat and then learning from those who have gone before and Jesus Himself what his role on this earth is which also gives the reader a far more understandable scope of our role in the war between light and dark of these last days.
1,Great Deception in vivid color!,"This spectacular book is simply that-""spectacular"" Doesn't matter if it is in truth, but it sure is spectacular! Several questions for those who read the book. What is the quest? What is the mountain? What is the battle for? Who is fighting? When is this battle? There are a myriad of questions I could ask, but a Bible scholar ought to have hackles on their necks with this one. But, so much of the church is ""feeling"" the spectacular instead of plowing the truth. My description of this book is the same as found in the book when the ""quester"" finds himself walking with faith hope and love but not walking with wisdom any longer. Those who read the book should be alarmed at this prospect. If this book is placed beside the Bible, you can't read both in agreement. God help us if all we end up with is the top of the mountain only to go back down to try again."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"Rick this book was the best book I've ever read, besides the Bible. I have never cried so hard, or rejoiced so loud reading a book as I have this one. I believe this book is an absolute must for anyone who claims to be a part of the body of Christ. Absolutely Captivating, could not put it down till I had finished it all. I'm sure I will read it again and again, Thank you again!"
5,Great book!,"Think of a Spirit filled Lord of the Rings. This book is a vision about the Way, the Kingdom, and Spiritual warfare. It's awesome and it will pump you up.I had to put it down numerous times while I read because my heart was wrecked.Rick Joyner and MorningStar ministries helped build my Spiritual foundation and brought me into experiencing God the way He wants us to experience Him: on a deep, personal and radical level. This ministry is saturated in integrity and the power of God."
5,Must read...biblically sound.. Christ is emphasized.,"Definitely causes you to reexamine the way you live life and makes you want to draw near to God and to his son, Jesus. Highly recommend both books. The Final Quest and The Call."
5,"Read this and take what the spirit gives, whether conviction or blessing","This book has had profound impact on several men of God who have sought God's lead and wisdom in prayer and who have found direction and conviction in that prayer, not answers in a book written by man. If you are tapped in, your spirit will discern what is for you and what is not. If you are not, you will probably post something lengthy trying to discredit that which you either don't understand or that which convicts. What would Satan be doing if he didn't have so many christians willing to cause division. Awesome book and great discussion starter. It's not doctrine, use your heart and pray about it, take the player out of the equation and see if the message has any relevance."
3,This is a work of fiction,"I gave this book 3 stars as it is only a mediocre work of fiction - a story of ""heroes and villains"" that could have been written by any fantasy writer, anywhere on earth - he would not even need to be especially religious. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars, only I think that I could have written something much better myself. The story consists of a series of largely unrelated dream scenarios with no coherent plot running though, and has no ending other than the largely predictable ""to be continued..."" slogan. The author's supposed encounters with historical and biblical figures are purely imaginary.However, the main problem with this book is simply this - it claims to be God's prophetic Word and, it seems, people actually believe it is!Christians - if you do read this book, remember it is only a story. At most, it can only inspire you to living a better life. If you want to know what God has in store for his church, it is best to turn to the Scriptures."
3,A mixture of Scripture with false teachings - Beware!,"It sounds like edifying yet there is a subtleness of untruth that keeps poking out. Even pagan relgious books would show a bit of truth for the benefit of humanity with a leaven of untruth that turns their eyes blind to see Christ as the only way. This book sounds too good to be true but I strongly suggest that the chuch should take an attitude of being a Berean first. Otherwise the chruch in the west is easy to be carried off by every wind of doctrine, starting from recent excesses in Toronto blessing, holy laughter, health-wealth gosepl, etc."
2,Disappointed,This book came highly recommended to me by a good friend but I regret to report that it is poorly written and more akin to fantasy than Christian fiction.
3,Acts 17:11 applies everywhere.,"How do I start:I read this book in a single sitting. It helped motivate me to search the scriptures daily.Is this book scripture? NoDoes it make you examine your personal relationship with Jesus? YesIs it worth reading? YesHaving grown up not believing in God (WOW! was I misguided), I didn't realize groups of believers actually fought with each other over various issues. I still distain 'religion' for this reason. I do know and love my Lord and saviour Jesus Christ.This book's chapter 'the hordes of hell are marching' hit the ""US vs. THEM"" mentality right on the head. Why don't the various groups of believers follow paul's exortation (Philippians 4:8). *sigh* people *shakes head*...anyhow...Read the book, it will point you right back to the Word."
1,Tragic,"This book is a sad commentary on the state of the Christian church today. There is nothing biblical about this book. Rick Joyner sets himself up as a prophet, but does not want to be accountable to the biblical accountibility required of a prophet. Please do not be taken in by the hype. Be discerning. Grace and peace."
1,Apostacy,I read the book when it first came out. It is all the worst of what has been written about it. Part cartoon and part mystic vision its doctrinal implications are anti-scripture with a new age thrust.This is a book that will lead the bible illiterate into a spiritual bondage Joyner has yet to imagine.
5,This book is for the maturing of believers in Jesus Christ,"The greatest part of the book, in my life is the story of a homeless man named Angelo. This story alone makes the book worth owning. It demonstrates to us that God does not judge by appearance, but by the truth hidden in man's heart."
4,"good,interesting,convicting, imaginative",I thought the book was interesting it opens your mind to ideas that you might not have thought on your own. It gives you reasons that things might be happening and addresses possibles of the battle taking place in the Spirit world. The book opened my eyes to the fact something like this could actually be taking place. It reminded me a lot of Pilgrams Progress.
5,I really felt God was personally talking to me throughout.,"I have never read a book, that as soon as I completed it, I read it again and found info. in it that I didn't see the first time. I feel that Rick Joyner has heard from God with this book. It opened my eyes to more of the spirit realm. Humility is very important in the work God has called us to in these last days. I personally felt that God talked to me all through this book, some areas of this book really ministered to me because of personal prophecies I had received and felt I received confirmation during the reading of the book. I would recommend this book to everyone."
4,awesome,The price is reasonable and the quality is pretty good. We make and decorate cakes at our house for the children.
4,Ok good,Works for most things. Bring your thinking cap just in case. Watch the multiple years stuff.
5,Honda Boat Motor Repair for Non Mechanics,This book was very easy to read and nicely illustrated for a novice and mostly unskilled mechanic like me. I have been able to keep my Honda boat motor in good running condition. I have had to repair my motor myself as I cannot afford to get it done by a professional mechanic. I have no doubt that I can troubleshoot and repair my motor as long as parts are available. This repair manual was better than I expected and the information provided has saved me time and money.
1,It's a poorly written book.,"Finally I learn this hard lesson: One who knows something DOES NOT necessarily know how to teach it.I was attracted by the impressive background of the author, and it's part of SUN's Java series. But I am stunned by the poor quality of the book as a teach-yourself material. Come on, Mr. Piroumian, of course you know this is a book for Java learners, not a RFC, or API specification. But it reads like the latter.I got my Java Programmer Certificate two years ago and consider myself an experienced Java programmer. But, I couldn't follow the book. It's that a hard and boring read. Those examples are dry, non-intuitive and useless in real world. After finishing the book, I still don't know how to do some quite simple tasks.Very disappointed."
5,Great book for wireless J2ME programming!,"One thing is certain. This author can write! His explanationsare lucid and organized. And his writing style is so easy to follow.Like he says, his examples demonstrate the concepts that hepresents in the chapters. I really feel that I now understandHOW to use J2ME the RIGHT WAY.I like this book better than any of the others that I bought.It's obvious that this author knows this space well.If you're getting a J2ME book, get this one!"
5,I in love with this author,"I found the book to be a good book on J2ME.I met the author while working for a big company.I thought he was a great person and a good looking man.I found the book to be an excellent book on not just J2ME, buta great introduction to the world of wireless communication"
1,"Order from Apple.com, not here with J&R.","I ordered this from Amazon, which sends the order to J&R. They sent me the kit for iPod and iPod mini. It is not adaptable to the shuffle. I called them and they put the order in again. They sent me the wrong one again. They made me pay the shipping to return both of them even though they sent me a different one than I ordered twice. They were not pleasant to work with either. I ordered the kit for shuffle from the apple store (apple.com) and got the right one."
1,Breaking Glass Wine Glass,"This wine rack is not functional at all. When I installed it, it slopes therefore the wine glasses slip and fall off the rack. This product is a dissappointment. Plus the sticks that hold the wine glass is very loose and the wine rack is poorly made."
4,Stemware Rack,Clean and neat. Manages to hold up to 14 glasses comfortably. Creates a beautiful display and matches light wood cabinets. Great deal!
2,Tanks cracked and leaked within two months,"I purchased this and another whole room humidifier by Essick Air at the same time. Within two months, the tanks on this unit were leaking (just normal use, not being rough). The other unit's motor died and I had a hard time getting the company to honor the warranty. So I have to dispute a previous poster's opinion that this company has great customer service, because I have seen the contrary. I would not recommend an Essick Air product."
4,Great little humidifier,"I recommend this product. Works great! Would not turn on out-of-the-box so I emailed customer service. They wrote right back to me (Yes, even the same day!!) and told me what the problem was and clear instructions as to how to fix it. Worked great after I got it going. Customer service gets a 5-star rating. Humidifier I give 4-stars. I would give it 5-stars, but I find the fan a bit noisy on the two higher settings."
2,OK while it lasted,"We bought one of these a little less than 3 years ago. The water tanks that came with it leaked immediately. I called Essick customer service and they sent (free of charge) new, redesigned tanks that worked fine. The unit gave out about a month ago. I called customer service and explained the problem to them. They said that it sounded like the fan motor was finished, so that is the end of this humidifier. They only have a one year warranty, so I'm out of luck. We paid around $90 for this, so that's around $30 per year. I won't be buying another Essick product."
1,unhappy sony video Photographer,This battery is supose to work in sony products that use npfm50. It does not work. I thought I would save money with this battery and now I have to send it back and buy a sony battery.
2,Cruelty free but clumpy,"I was really disappointed with this product as there are so few cruelty free mascaras on the market as it is. It clumps, it clumps, it clumps."
2,Is this is good as it gets?,"After looking over this book I have to say that it's cleary one of the worst music theory books I've ever seen for ANY type of instrument outside of ""....for Dummies."" The format is not clear, and there is no consistent way of understanding the terms and concepts he uses. Also, he's clearly not up to date on the advances in guitar tablature (and this book came out in 2002?!) which is a REAL drawback. I can understand the book - with difficulty - because I have a background in music. But if you're looking for a basic understanding of music theory for the guitar...save your money IMO. The author/sellers don't mention that one needs to already posess more than a basic understanding of music and especially chords (shapes, etc.) to get what he's presenting to his audience. A real disappointment and waste of money...at least I can recycle it."
1,Very disappointing,"When I read the reviews for this book, there were about five very positive and one negative. You now have another negative. I got as far as page 33 two or three times over, and each time found something else wrong. Yes, wrong. From counting out beats for a line of music that don't appear to be related to one another, to referring to diagrams on other pages only to find they didn't exist (not anywhere in the book), to basic errors in music notation (check out the whole rest that should be a quarter rest at the top of Page 25) and some other gems, I finished up wondering what else I was missing that I shouldn't be learning. I decided I couldn't take the risk and will probably consign it to my woodstove. It's sad, but I could have bought a quarter of a cord (not chord!) of wood for the price of this book...I think Mr. Serb should find another editor for what I'm sure he had hoped would be a great resource for struggling guitarists."
2,Dear Tom: Please prepare an enhanced edition.,"The author is an excellent educator associated with guitarnoise,and he has written excellent article for that guitar page. This book does not give him justice: he knows much better information that is missing here, and there are many typos and some questions without answering.Tom please do an enhanced eidtion."
2,"As a veteran of the Gulf War, Somalia and Bosnia.....","After the fall of the Berlin Wall, my service has been as fast, furious and jumpy as Hackworth's book Hazardous Duty. Bottom line: I never sensed that he stayed around any one of these three conflicts I served in long enough to get a true appreciation of place (especially Bosnia).A interesting book, but I found the quality of writing was lacking. I felt his observations were many times not grounded in fact, in my humble opinion.I was particularly disappointed with his chapters on the Balkans. I felt like I was watching a cheap horror movie aimed to get the easy scare, then move on to the next one. But heh, who can claim to be an expert, apologies to Rebecca West.Kudos to him on his chapters on Somalia. Not being based in Mogudishu, I found them insightful."
5,IT'S THE GRUNT THAT PAYS THE PRICE -NO MONEY IN HIS SAFETY,"COLONEL HACKWORTH CUTS TO THE CHASE IN WHY OUR MILITARY HAS FAILED. IT'S NOT BEING USED AS IT SHOULD AND ITS LEADERS ARE NOT WARRIORS BUT POLITICIANS. WHY DO WE UTILIZE THE SAME INFANTRY EQUIPMENT THAT OUR FATHERS USED? WHY NOT SOME HIGH TECHNOLOGY SMALL ARMS AND BODY ARMOR? EASY, NO MONEY IN IT. WHEN THE BIG GUYS RETIRE THEY GET HIRED BY THE MILITARY INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.THIS TYPE OF ""NEPOTISM"" COSTS LIVES AND WARS. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING IN CONGRESS AND WEST POINT."
4,Hack is on target.,"I am an Army veteran of Somalia and Haiti. The first time I read Hack's writings was while I was in Port-au-Prince during Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY. His account of that operation was brutally accurate and was a huge hit with the grunts of the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) for speaking the naked truth. I was eager to read more. On Somalia, he was just as accurate. He calls it as he sees it, and he sees it for what it really is. Writing in familiar English, Hack offers his wealth of experience and provides keen insight about military matters. He knows the business of soldiering like no other. His credibility with warriors--past and present--is unmatched."
4,Well written and informative,"This book is an easy read and Hackworth lays bare a great deal of problems with our current military. He also has many solid suggestions on how to improve the system. Unfortunately, the powers that be will probably not do any of them."
1,a huge disappointment,"I couldn't believe this came from the author of ""About Face."" I've read many books on the current state of our military, but this was by far the worst. He tells of his boring personal adeventures in all but the very last chapter. And in the last chapter he makes some of the craziest and dumbest suggestions for military reform yet suggested. Don't waste your time on this one. It was bad."
3,Not nearly as good as About Face,"I really wanted to like Hazardous Duty, because I thought About Face was great. Hazardous Duty suffers from inaccuracies (especially about Hack's claims of numerous amputations due to infections in Somalia, it just did not happen), relying on far too many unnamed and anonymous sources, which strains credibility, and his constant, every other page raging against the Perfumed Princes, grows tiresome and boring quickly. It's only really worth reading if you're a big fan of Hack or want to know how some things work about our military, but take it with a grain of salt. Oh, to the guy on here who thinks Schwarzkopf is the greatest general in the modern era, read ""The Generals' War."" It backs up Hack's every criticism of that buffoon. P.S. my uncle was a war-planner LTC in Desert Storm, he said the same things about Schwarzkopf."
3,To all reviewers below..,"To all reviewers beloew: this book is everything BUT historically accurate.I can't believe that, with the Internet available to anyone, you have not yet discovered that Sven Hassel NEVER fouight in World War II, never went to Russia, never fired a gun!He was a Danish Gestapo-informer named Borge Villy Redsted Pedersen. It's all fake, even LEGION OF THE DAMNED is fake.However, the merit in his books are the humor, the anti-belic statements, their anti-heroes."
2,Elvira & lady frankenstein,"It's kind of lame, hence the Elvira hostess! Likely considered fairly good ""back in the day"". But if you like Elvira, then get it and add to your collection."
4,schlage hooks,nice hook. not many have bend in upper hook at different level than lower hook so that 2 items can be hung at once.
3,teen review,"The book Timon's Tide is about a boy named Daniel. He is 17 years old, he lived with his mother who is remarried and prenant. 6 years ago his older brother Timon die of a drugs related accident. Daniel blame himself for his brother death. Now he must accept the fact that his older brother is dead and doesn't have a brother to advise him on how to express his love to the girl he like. He still think that his older brother is still alive because Timon keep on reappearing. Now he must solve the mystery his older brother death so that he can move on with his life. I think the book is confusing because it skip some part that I think were important. It did not talk about Daniel's real problem. The book did not decribes the charaters clearly. It talk about drugs, affair, and mental problem which did not go well in the story. I did not like the ending of the book because nothing good happen and it just leave me hanging. Overall I did not like the book."
3,Ok for the price...,"Considering the time my Wife and I spent looking for something like this, it turned out to be a descent find for the price; however, regarding the quality, it's average. For instance, water rings are permanant and a yankee candle will EASILY leave marks."
1,This is a Book?,"Chariton offers no explanation for the airship sightings. He just regurgitates some period newspaper reports then advises the reader to decide what the airships were while offering to meet the reader in Aurora, Texas with a jug of Dr. Pepper! Good grief. After wasting my money on this book, I came across Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery (Michael Busby). If you want definitive answers in a tightly wrapped, investigative style format buttressed by extensive tables, graphs, and details written by an expert then pass this book by and go for Busby's book. If you want bubble gum and Dr. Pepper, buy Chariton's book."
2,weird smell.,"smells like some kind of room spray. i will use it as something other than a personal fragrance. it has an industrial odor, and it's not a feminine smell."
5,That every man can be armed and speak freely,"1st and 2nd Amendments...seems like they'd be the ""most"" important. Bill of Rights...sounds like we might want to ""protect"" them. And who wants to give them up???? Some folks in this country would....oh that's right they just don't like the 2nd one. I wonder why. Intimidated by what they don't know enough about I suspect. Good book! Thank you Mr. Halbrook."
5,Required reading for pro-2nd amendment,"This book should be required reading for anyone going into law or government. Halbrook thoroughly traces the history of the right of self defense and arms from antiquity to our own 2nd Amendment. He documents the authors intent through their own writings from the times and traces it's treatment in the courts from inception to the present. Far from being his own ""goofy"" interpretation the individual right interpretation is now considered the ""standard"" interpretation by even liberal constitutional scholars. Anyone who says otherwise has either not read the book or is lying to themselves and others. Sources are given through exhaustive cites. You don't have to believe Halbrook, you can go directly to his sources. Like others have pointed out, read what the courts actually said in Cruikshank and Miller and you will see they are almost opposite of what most gun control advocates claim."
2,Akhil Amar's Bill of Rights is *much* better,"Can't really say much that I like about this book (except that it's not anti-gun, which apparently matters more to previous reviewers than quality of insight). It seems like the same tired reading of history through a narrow ideological lens. If you want a more interesting (pro-gun) reading, have a look at Akhil Amar's ""The Bill of Rights"". He does a better job in the few pages he devotes to the Second Amendment that this Halbrook does in the whole book.Here's a question: why is it that the books of the lowest quality, both pro- and anti- gun, get the best reviews?"
5,Profound and Important Work,"This is one of the most profound works that one will ever come into contact with. In it, Halbrook demonstrates the true meaning of the right to keep and bear arms, and why it is so vital to the maintenance of liberty. The basic equation that emerges from his discourse is that liberty can only exist if a populace is armed. In addition to this, he delves into the constitutional, political, and ideological origins of the Second Amendment. Moreover, he demostrates exactly what the Amendment means, what it was intended to imply, and what it still means today. This book is essential reading for everyone who wishes to defend the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms."
4,"Good review, but a bit dry..","The history references are priceless, the background information indispensable. However, you won't find this book exciting unless you have a burning interest in learning the history of firearms and the concept of rights for firearms in the USA. Any ""anti-gunner"" who has an open mind might take a look at this to understand why the ""pro-gunners"" have such a strong feeling about it."
4,Mitra's Magic Mystery,"So surprised to read a book of such complex plot, from a writer I have never heard of. Is Mitra a nom de plume of someone famous? The story spans from an English village in the 70s to the modern day Manhattan! Hints of Agatha Christie books is an effective ploy. The sheer delight is the camaraderie of the chief characters, Dr. Martin, Halley Willard and Sandy Bloorwoise. Into the cauldron, where single malt whiskey and gourmet food sizzle, add the delightful (but rather feeble witted) Inspector Dobbelia Smith and the results are heart warming. The first mystery in the book is more compact and convincing. The main mystery, although unnecessarily convoluted, is still a danger to your hair, since you keep scratching your head! Keep it on your Christmas list!"
1,swtester,"If you want your HP printer driver to be USELESS, then buy PlanPlus. I purchased version 3.0 hoping the solution would be fixed -- it was not and after four years of having time to fix the problem.Readers beware PlanPlus sw has had a bug in it (some say on purpose) to shut down most HP printers for the last four years unless you use a generic driver for the printer. Why is this the case? Well it is not hard to understand when you note the company makes great profit on its hardcopy planner page sales. Having SW that can print out planner pages, while they are trying to sell their own pages, was probably a bad idea by the company and their only solution is to sell the software but make it conflict with printing software."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Nasty stuff. I could never even install it completely, and now it won't uninstall completely. Customer service at Franklin Covey was unable to help, and didn't really seem to care. This is garbage software, don't even think about buying it."
2,Disappointment,"Guessing from the way the other reviews go - I think each of the bags pictured is made from different material and has different levels of quality. I purchased ""Mortal"", vintage olive...this one has very flimsy material and seams started to separate within a week. Strap material is flimsy and not supportive of bags weight when filled...it rolls up, does not lie flat. Had purchased Israeli Paratrooper in Olive Drab (another seller) previously and thought this would be the same quality...it's not. Contacted seller twice but received no reply. If you are looking to tote really lightweight stuff - okay...but this does not make a good bag for a kid who wants to tote all his skate gear or schoolbooks."
5,Great Bag,"I read some of the reviews before i bought this bag, and i have to disagree with some of them. I read the one about the shoulder strap length and I have to disagree with that. I think that is is just right. I am 6'3"" and i think that it fits well. It is not down around my butt, but right in the middle of my lower back where i think it should be. The texture is great its holds a lot of stuff. I can't wait to but it though all the test of my busy life."
2,Some what Disappointing,ok the bag itself is ok my only problem with it is the shoulder strap its tiny for those of you who say its perfect you have to be midgets this bag looks like a purse on me and its not all that roomy it barely holds all my stuff it cant even fit an American lit textbook don't buy its crap
2,I should have saved my money,"I bought this courier bag because I was in dire need of something that could transport all my junk around campus; this was defintely not the bag for me. It can barely hold my bio, psy, and music books without looking like it's going to split, I have no idea who that one guy stuffed 5 laptops into it.Then there's the strap, how on Earth can anyone over 5'6 find this comfortable? I'm 6'4 and this thing looks (and feels)like a purse on me, I had to pull a strap off one of my travel bags just to make it hang past my chest!I guess if you're housed in a small-bird like frame then this is the bag for you; for everyone else I recommend looking elsewhere..."
2,Don't waste your time with this.,It does not do anything they show in the infomercial. Keep using it 5-10 or 20 min at one place with hardly much difference in its condition. My normal 409 cleaner cleans tile grout much more effectively and quickly than this steamer! It's quite a useless purchase for me. I am back to cleaning the conventional way-Ajax and Easy Off etc..
1,Waste of money!,"I followed instructions to the letter. I couldn't wait to get this steamer. On the first use it made steam just fine. I cleaned and stored the unit, but the inside of this thing corrodes constantly and clogs from within. Therefore, it gets hot, but the steam does NOT come out. You can rinse 100 times and still get particles coming out of the tank. This is a worthless piece of junk!"
3,Good service,"I ordered the 3 ft cord but they were out of stock, so they upgraded me to the 6 ft cord and no extra cost."
1,Terrible,Wanted to use this to plug my speaker system up to my phone. Cable is of terrible quality I just went to Best Buy and picked up a more expensive one but it did cost me some money ($15?). Would not buy again.
1,These broke in a couple of weeks,"The plastic end pieces (the jack plugs) separated from the cord itself on both ends. Then the wires inside broke the day after. Why can't anyone make these that work, and are reinforced? Don't buy these!"
5,Great Cable for Remote Radio Receiver- Alien Bees & Briteks,"I use this cable differently than most...they connect to a Paul Buff CyberSync Radio Receiver for my Alien Bee B800 strobe lights or my Britek PS-200 strobe lights, it works great on all of them and are far less expensive than the cords ordered through any company that sells photography equipment! Very Satisfied!!!"
1,Awful,"Simply put, this cable did not work from the moment we took it out of the packaging. It seems very cheaply made and is obviously low quality. Would recommend looking somewhere a bit nicer if you're looking for this type of cable."
3,decent,"with one of the edges shaven off, it fits well into my Dre Beats as a replacement cord, but the wire whenever moved creates distortion within the sound. super cheap though."
2,poor quality product,"The build quality of this cable is very poor. There is also no insulation from other devices so I frequently hear ""things"" from other electronic devices nearby. Quite a distraction. The ""plug ends"" are loose -- and have been since I opened the package. It does ""work"" -- just poor quality."
1,Complete junk,"I tried to use this cable between my iPhone and an extender, using it as a replacement my 3-year old destroyed. It is junk. The slightly movement of the wire and you get static and worse. You get what you pay for. Avoid this one."
1,junk,"this cable broke within 3 hours. you can fiddle with it, but it won't work consistently. I bought it because I despise radio shack, but I won't buy it again."
1,Wrong item sent,Was sent FOUR BAND plug rather than three band (like the picture)..Wait awhile and then discover they're completely useless.. Now I have to reorder from someplace else..
2,Works when it wants too.,"The slightest bump causes this cable to lose connection with my phone. Tried on my surround sound receiver and my car stereo. Everytime I picked up the phone to change the song I had too unplug and plug the cable back in to get sound. My cheap retractable cable that had electric tape wrapped around it did a better job than these. Good thing I only spent $3.82 for 2 of these. Hopefully the right angle cables from RedTagTown are better, the reviews sound much more positive."
3,"Not for your car, OK for home","This cable is best for fixed applications. When using in a car, the sound tends to go in and out depending on the cable connection to the pin. It's also rather bulky, another negative for the car.I switched it to my speakers at home and have not had any problems with it."
1,Buy a Better one-,I bought this to play my pandora from my phone into my car. Really not worth it. I know its super cheap and I should have had really low expectations. But from the ever beginning when I got this it barely worked. Now a month later its dead. Right from the start I was having to tinker with getting the plug-in in the exact right postion so the sound didnt crack and pop. I ordered one that was much more expensive and have had zero issues with it. I gave this one to my wife and she informed me today that it officially doesnt work any longer.
1,Didn't hold out long,They only head out for about a week of use then they died. Could be just the amount of use though.
1,Not for Mobile Use,"I purchased 3 of these cables for different applications. One was to hook the headphone out of my DROID to the Aux in on my car. Within one week, the cable started dropping the right channel intermittently and now only works when I do a lot a jiggering of the cable at both ends. The build quality is pretty terrible for it to fail within a week.I also got one for a permanent hookup between audio components. The sound quality is fine and there are no signs of failure. As the cable will not be moved, I trust it will remain OK.BUT, as most folks are going to use this with a mobile device (IPod, Smartphone, etc), I highly recommend you purchase a better quality cable with much more durable and flexible end connections. I learned my lesson."
4,Beautiful Japanese anime,"Although this is a fictitious story about a young lady general Oscar Fracoise de Jarjay, some of the events really happened and the portrayal of Marie Antoinette was that of a naive young nobility who loved life and looking for and enjoying worldly pleasure at the cost of the French people. One can learn a few things within French court during the 18th century, all the intrigues, betrayals, corruptions are detailed in this beautifully made Japanese anime. The color of the DVD is brilliant, the only flaw is that for every chapter, you have to go to the main menu to select, neverthelss, it's still worth buying."
2,"Okay for cats, maybe, but not dogs","Previous reviews regarding flimsy construction are accurate. The minuscule ""compartments"" on top of the roof can't hold more than a single dog biscuit or two, max, and the lids arrived broken and unusable anyway. Construction quality screams ""China."" The included ""food and water travel dish"" can't hold more than half a dozen pieces of kibble and a few drops of water...a joke, really, and completely useless. I bought the ""medium/large"" size for a medium size (15 lb.) dog (small beagle) and found it is far too small for a dog, even of that size. Cats, maybe, but not dogs, no way. I'll now be returning this or trying to resell it to a cat owner at a discount."
3,"right size, wrong amenities","The size was as promised, but the plastic food/water holder was broken & IT WAS NOT THE RIGHT COLOR AT ALL."
1,Junk,"I have a twenty pound cocker spaniel that I use this kennel for. Not only can I not carry the kennel with the dog in it because the side clips will give way, but the dog is able to remove the door to the kennel while it's latched by pushing on it until it pops loose. What was wrong with the old Pet Taxi kennels that had screws that held the top and bottom together? I am basically unable to keep the dog in this kennel. Definitely will not be buying this brand again."
4,"Compartments are good, easy to assemble","There's only 1.5 things wrong with this crate. One is the colors in the picture is not the same as the actual product, and I bought this one for the color. So naturally, I was disappointed. It is more an off white and muted green. The compartments on top are great. I had a whole day out with my puppy and I had enough room to store 2 meals worth of food in little ziplock bags, a few treats and his harness. The 0.5 is that the rubber on the latch handle can come off and my puppy wanted to eat it.I consider returning it because of the color (yes I am shallow), but my dad put it together before I even had a chance to say I wanted to return it. Overall good product."
4,Not bad,"No way this crate comes apart just holding your pet in it, unless your pet is 100 pounds or your too stupid to put it together correctly. Would purchase again."
5,Perfect Size for my Carpet Sharks,"I purchased this for my two carpet sharks (ferrets), and it is the perfect size for them. They have plenty of room to move/play around, as they always go everywhere together.One of my adult cats decided to inspect the new carrier, and to my surprise, she fit. For a quick car trip, it is ok, however, I wouldn't use this carrier for her for long trips because she cannot easily turn around in it. I would also hold it from the bottom ... although the side clips are quite sturdy, I wouldn't want to test them on my 12 lb. cat. The ferrets are only a few pounds so holding the carrier by the handle is fine for them. I definitely recommend this for small animals."
2,too small,"this pet carrier is too small to use on anything larger than a pet rat (no, make that a pet mouse). the picture of the dog sitting in the door of the carrier had to be photochopped. yes the size is listed so it is my fault for buying. make sure you realize how small this pet carrier is."
1,Flimsy crate,"We purchased this for a cavalier king charles spaniel, now 6 months old. While the product looks great, it's just not constructed well enough to trust with a live animal. Ours separated when the bottom flexed and the clips on the sides sprung. They were snapped securely, but just couldn't handle the weight of a 16 pound puppy. Needless to say, we are quite disappointed. Now that this is over 30 days old, it's just junk. My recommendation is to spend a few bucks more to get a quality product."
4,pet carrier,Nice product wish the handle and top to bottom attachment clips were made of stronger material. I haven't had a problem but the carried doesn't give me a secure feeling. This carrier is great to secure an animal while traveling or transporting on top of other crates but I don't carry my dog in it.
4,Great for my Mini bull terrier puppy,"My 3 months old mini bull terrier loves it. She sleeps all day long on it and when we travel she stays very calm and confortable inside. I only give 4 stars because I bought as a large crate and it looks like a medium one. For now my little puppy fits, but I'm sure I will have to buy a bigger one when she grows up."
4,Away we go,"I needed something for a twice a year visit to the vet with my cat. It's perfect. Inexpensive, easy to get ready for use."
4,Nice and simple carrier,"This is a great carrier for it's price. It is very simple to assemble, and large enough for our cat. One of the plastic clamps that hold the top and bottom halves together bent and almost broke when putting it together initially, but it is still hanging on and everything else works great."
5,Great for Flying Your Pet,This is great for flying your pet. It also features handy compartments on the top to store their food in.Highly recommended.
3,wrong color twice,"I like the product fine, but I got the wrong color. Mine was not even green- it was blue and white. Thought it was a mistake so asked them to replace with correct color. . . and they sent me back blue and white. Now I don't have time to keep sending back to see if MAYBE they will wake up and send me the right color. Not sure if they are color blind or just don't care . . ."
4,Pretty in Pink,Whenever I take my pet for a ride with me. She goes in style and confortable. She loves it and I love it for her. the price is very good too.
3,SMALL,This was a lot smaller than I expected but I guess that was mostly my fault for not paying attention to the title that well. Besides being a completely different color than the picture and smaller than I wanted it seems like a good buy. (And it is definitely less expensive than going to a place like petco or petsmart) Overall not too bad.
4,Pet Carrier,Works great for cats. Mine never wants to come out of it. The two storage pockets on top are great for food &/or treats.
4,So far so good,I like this product. I did my research and this was a pretty good price. It was packaged good and arrived on time.
4,A great pair of speakers at a great price.,"I just received these speakers two days ago and I must say I like what I'm hearing. I bought these to replace a pair of JBL bookshelf speakers that I bought twenty years ago. These are a big improvement. They're much bigger than my old speakers which makes my wife a bit annoyed, but the fidelity is well worth ""that look"" that I got from her when I first set them up in the living room. They sound great whatever type of music (rock, classical, ambient) I've played through them so far. Great range of sound. Good highs and lows. They came well packed and seem like they can withstand my kids. My only worry is they have a bit of a high center of gravity and I hope my toddler won't pull them over. Otherwise I'm very happy with these speakers and would recommend them to any music fan who wants great quality at a great price."
3,"Good product, but not the best","Although I like the sound this speakers produce, I feel that they lack more power on the deep bass range. And that is unforgivable at this price range. The treble and mid ranges, though, sound very very good.If I had more money at the time of my purchase, I believe I would have gone with some Bose speakers..... even with their inflated prices!!"
5,The Voice of the Lord Messianic Jewish Daily Devotional,This is a must for those seeking understanding for their daily walk with Yeshua. It is a refreshing light with great insight and a good way to share the Word and the Good News. It is the way that our day starts and the words carry us through with a longing for what is to come the next day. It is a must for the Messianic believer.
2,Greasy Looking,"I used Sebastian Shaper light spray for years, then they discontinued it. I tried this one thinking it would be comparable as it was the same brand. It is not! It is fine and goes on with a very light spray but the hair looks greasy and weighted down within hours of using, especially if I brush it. It looks like teenage greasy hair would look when you were young and needed to wash your hair. I am 60yrs old will be finding something else. This stuff is awful."
2,Stinky & alergy inducing,"I should have returned this when I had the chance. The scent is terrible and as soon as I sprayed it, I started sneezing every time. Regular Sebastian Shaper hairspray is my favorite, but this stuff stinks!"
2,Its okay-just okay,"I was fortunate enough to read a copy of this book belonging to a friend before investing in it. The book is okay and for collectors or people who can't get enough of old scopes, and the information is interesting and very useful-a lot of research. But for a person happening upon an occasional old scope of interest, it isn't worth the asking price of todays market. I suppose if it were such a great book, it wouldn't have gone out of print as enough people would have been buying it to keep it around, but sadly there isn't a lot of other subject related information out there, so if you live and love old scopes, buy-up."
4,Insiders View Of The Gambia,"I bought this book cautiously, not knowing what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised.Our Grandmothers' DrumsThis book is somewhat dated, but is still highly relevant and I think you'll find value in reading if you are interested in rural life in The Gambia.I have a close family member serving in The Gambia. I worry about him and wanted to know more of what his life may be going through.This book eases my concerns and fears somewhat. I recommend you read this if you are planning an extended stay in The Gambia or if someone you care for will be travelling and living there. My Grandmothers Drums will help you realize the struggles and joys available in the complicated nation.Sincerely,Will In IL"
5,Arabia Remembered,"Jonathan Raban has brought to the fore many of my memories from having lived in the Middle East for five years. I was there during the oil boom of the 70's, the time he chronicles in this book. His ability to convey his experiences without condemning or romanticizing is truly unique. When I see the incredulous look on the faces of others when I tell them how it was then, I sometimes doubt my own recollection. Raban tells me not to doubt. He was there, he saw the same, heard the same, smelled the same and felt the same. This author continues to be my all-time favorite. I recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the Middle East and it's people."
2,Durability is the only problem,"After 11 months my Harmony 520 stopped. All but Activity, Device and Help keys seems to be dead. Logitech service support was a charm, and I receive a Harmony 510 to replace the defective 520 in Rio de Janeiro, all taxes paid (Harmony 520 model was discontinued). So, I recommend to buy another model (Harmony 510) and/or to buy with an extended warranty."
1,Absolutely worthless,"This is the first Logitech product that has ever let me down, and apparently when Logitech fails they fail in a big way. The software to update the remote is pathetically slow, to the extent that it had my CPU maxed out at 100%, and I by no means have an antiquated machine.The ""truly universal"" nature of the remote is a joke, as often when trying to program an individual button the remote won't even register that you've pressed the button on your original remote. Frankly I've gotten better results in the past from a $20 Walmart universal remote than this supposedly high-end home theater controller. Logitech ought to be ashamed that they even released this product to the public, and they ought to really be ashamed that they're retailing it at a $100 price point. Don't waste your time on this abomination.This is getting returned first thing tomorrow morning."
2,"Wonderful Hardware, Disaster Software","Hardware is wonderful, and works totally as described.But software designed to customize the remote is a disaster. It always loses connectivity while sync. or IR learn.Customizing and/or adding an activity is very hard. They have to redesign this software.I have missed my Philips Pronto"
1,Unhappy with Logitech Customer Support,"Issue solved! I returned the Harmony for a full refund. All thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team. After screwing up everything on Christmas day (it was a Christmas present)), your support staff said ""level 2"" would contact me within 24 hours.After waiting 72 hours, I called ""support"" again yesterday. After waiting 30 minutes, I finally got to speak with a real-live agent who ""could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor's approval."" This was after providing the incident number. That took another 15 minutes. I then waited another 30 minutes (total now 1:15) before I had to leave.I tried again several hours later. After being told ""level 2 was not available."" I hung up and immediately returned my Harmony to ....Thanks, Logitech.-Keith"
5,Programs just about Any device...,"There is nothing this remote can't program...as you connect up to the internet when you set it up. It also can LEARN from another remote. If you have access to the internet, I would HIGHLY Recommend this device. You won't be sorry."
3,An OK all-in-one remote control,"I bought this as a refurbished for $30. In less than 1 hour, i have 5 device set up, which includes xbox360, TV, Kodak HD Dock, VCR, and DVD.I really like the ""learn"" function of the remote, which makes it possible to control every device with a RF receiver. But the software has room to improve. And the hardware, buttons are too sticky. LCD screen contrast not good. The all off button doesn't work some time, and needs press help button to make it work. Activity function works partially for certain set of device. The range and angle is OK, much better than some of my original remote controls. All in all, it is a phased-out Logitech harmony remote. And i got what i paid for."
4,Infinitely flexible; a tweaker's delight!,"I purchased the Harmony 520 based on all the favorable reviews I've read, and I must say I'm amazed by this product. It can control up to 15 ""devices"" and can be programmed for several different ""activities"", such as Watch a Movie, Listen to CD's, etc. The Harmony website makes configuring your remote a breeze....once you learn to navigate through all the menus, and this does take a little practice. But once you get the hang of it, there's no end to what you can teach your remote to do for you. I've never encountered a universal remote that was so flexible and full of options...you can make your commands as straightforward or as complex as you like; the choice is up to you.One slight quibble I have is with the size of the buttons on this particular model. They are somewhat small (the entire remote is streamlined and sleek), so if you have a big thumb you might run into trouble operating it. But otherwise it's a great product; I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Remote Control,Very easy to setup; Help Button on the remote is really very helpfull.A great buy for the price. If not for the small buttons I will give it 5 stars.I will recomend to all my friends. My first buy on the internet.Impressed with Amazon.com
4,Great deal!,"This is a great remote that I got for about 1/3 of the retail price, and decent shipping rates."
5,All that it's suposed to be,"I picked up this remote for it's value price. And it did everything it wa supossed to. Setup was very easy online and I did not have to teach the remote any commands. My home theatre system is over 10 years old and it picked up all the commands for it! This remote will end your remote blues, and for the money, the value is outstanding!"
4,works great; easy to transition from 510 to 520,Bought this unit to replace an aging Logitech 510 universal remote. Very easy to transition using the software supplied. This unit uses blue backlight with essentially gray text which is difficult to read; fortunately I don't need to read the display often as I'm already used to the operation of the earlier unit. Batteries supplied with the unit were 'pre-corroded' so this must have been sitting on the shelf for some time. Other than the gray on blue screen and the corroded batteries this would be 5 stars...
1,Won't ever buy another one,"I bought one of these (from a different vendor) and have been disappointed. The buttons are very small and not intuitively placed. The different functions just feel ""out of place"" (logically) while trying to use it. And it's not like this is the only universal remote I've ever used either.Also, the little transistor or diode or whatever it is that makes the display light go on and off, has worn out. So the remote just shines the light all the time and the batteries wear out quickly. Additionally, the Logitech software that comes with it is not very intuitive either. How about a GUI that actually shows PICTURES instead of words? Do you expect this remote to only be bought and used by programmers and coders? I had such high hopes considering the name Logitech was on it, but unfortunately it was not to be. My review: proceed with caution. Note: since I bought this elsewhere, my review in no way reflects on Amazon at all. It's just a review of the product."
3,good but no cigar,"the remote does what it advertises, but the keys are a bit small for the wholes and frequently get stucked under the cover. Overall it was worth the money but could have been designed better."
1,Ok While It Lasted,"It was an okay remote while it lasted. I had it for about a 1-1/2 years where it was lightly used on a bedroom TV/cablebox/DVD player setup. Started getting ""Safe Mode"" error messages on it that just kept coming back - then it took several tries to turn my TV on. Reinstalled the firmware several times with no improvement. Now it in the waste can.Besides that problem, the screen is really small and the button layout is kinda strange even compared to the other Logitech remote I own. Shop around for something that lasts and is easier to use then this one. You won't be sorry."
1,don't buy,"I bought this because I owned a 652 and the price was right. But when I programed this it wouldn't work right. I could access inputs on the tv, but I couldn't use the up or down arrows or the select. Wouldn't work on my 612 dish reciever at all except power. Couldn't program my dvd recorder and its an RCA.I would advise anyone looking for a remote to do it all check out the other models don't get this one!!!"
2,Nice remote... just can't use it!,"Before you pick up any Harmony-series universal remote, make sure it's compatible with your ISP.That's right, your ISP.I spent several hours trying to figure out why I couldn't get past Logitech's login screen. Time after time, I received nothing but session time outs and ASP errors. After diving into their user support forums, it turns out these errors aren't that uncommon. There seems to be a problem with the way the Logitech webservers handle proxies. Some people have overcome this by switching proxies or connecting through a different ISP. I've had no such luck after toying with dozens of different proxy servers and my dialup backup.Why Logitech doesn't let their software configure the remote, or heck, offer the option of manually inputting remote codes is beyond me. Having to be at the mercy of their servers, for lack of a better word, just plain sucks..."
3,Multi remotes or programmable remote???,"The remote itself is good however, this one they sent me some of the buttons ""stick"" and they have changed the format. The old remotes had a ""skip"" button to jump over unwanted commercials, the new one does not. Once again having a single remote vs three of them for different functions I vote programmable remote!"
4,A true Universal Remote,"It really replaced my other 3 controls. I recommend using rechargeable batteries, as I have to replace them in less than 3 months."
2,"Close, but no Cigar","The Harmony 520 is a great idea. But unfortunately falls short. Here are some problems.1. Is unable to power on my Sony CD player. While it can control it once Ive turned it on, it would be nice for me not to have to walk across the room to power it on and off. That is the point of the remote after all. Also, if I am listening to a cd and want to switch to DVD player, the remote does not power off my cd player. The cd player keeps playing and the remote simply changes the input on my receiver.2. Same problem with my X-box 360. Only this time not only does it not turn it on and off, but the remote is unable to control any of the functions of the X-box.The idea of an integrated remote is great. Hopefully Logitech will design a model that works."
5,Does Everything I Need,"Much better than the remote that came with my VIZIO 37"". I can program the buttons to do what I need them to do. I have Dish Network, Sony Blueray, and Panasonic DVD recorder/VCR combo. The Remote controls everything perfectly. I also have a 550 that I like even better."
3,a pain to set up but it works,"total pain to set this up but once you get it right it works great. especially if you have a lot of components controlling different things like I do. If all you have is a TV cable box and dvd played dont bother... use your cable remote. but if you have all that plus an audio receiver, xbox and other things its worth getting a remote like this. Only attempt to set this up if you are very comfortable with electronics. If not, buy one from a big box store and have them set it up for you. You will pay a lot more for that though."
3,Buttons are hard to press,"Logitech Harmony Remote Controls are fantastic. I can practically find any device in their software. My only problem with this particular model is the the black button set on the remote. These rubber buttons are quite difficult to press. I have to press them with my fingernails in order to get it send the command. Other harmony remotes have better buttons. Aside from the rubber buttons the remote is sleek, light and feels great."
4,Great remote for a great price!,"I bought this remote to go along with my new home theater. I was debating between this and the 550 remote and can say that I am very happy that I bought the 520. They are nearly identical, the 550 has 6 more buttons I think and I have no need for the extra buttons. I got this for $30 less than the 550. So far I have had no real problems with the programming of this remote. The software, I feel, is really nice. Very quick until you personalize buttons, it takes a little practice but once I got used to things it went extremely quick. This remote worked with all of my components seamlessly. No problems what so ever, I have a LG Receiver, Panasonic TV, PS3 and Xbox. It worked with everything. The only negative is that the remote seems a bit flimsy but not a problem. I will be careful with it. I highly recommend the Harmony 520 to everyone!"
1,Screen Nearly Unreadable - Consider the 550 Instead,"I already owned a Harmony 720 for my main AV system. I LOVE that remote, but I couldn't justify the cost of another 720 for my bedroom system, so I bought the 520. I really wanted to like it, but couldn't. There's nothing wrong with the functionality, but the font on the screen is too small and too dim to read easily. The backlight doesn't help it any - in fact it makes it worse. I finally took it back and purchased a Harmony 550 for only about $10 more. The Harmony 550 remote is a great compromise between the 520 and 720. Although I love Harmony remotes, I do NOT recommend the 520."
2,Disappointed,"I already own a Harmony 880 which is very good. From reviews I read, this 520 sounded like it would do a good job on a simpler system the relatives put together. I should have spent the additional money on another 880. The buttons on the 520 are small and hard to press, they also frequently don't contact for the command to be sent. One other problem is that the screen is difficult so read in almost any light. The software did not allow one normal ACTIVITY for the Panasonic plasma TV, that of viewing from the SD card slot."
4,Best next to sliced bread,"This is my first universal remote and I am amazed at what all it does. Setup was a breeze on WinXP with the provided software including juggling all the mind boggling connection combinations that are thrown up by a LCD TV, Yamaha Audio receiver, Motorola PVR and a Philips DVD player. The initial configuration was done within 3-4 minutes once the Logitech software downloaded all software and firmware updates for the remote. And, everything just works!! Bye bye four remotes just when my wife was starting to get frustrated with all the added complexity that came with a new LCD TV and home theater system.I have taken off one star because I am a nitpicker. The one star comes off for size and battery consumption - uses 4 AAA batteries. OTOH, for what I paid for this remote on sale, $30 including shipping and taxes, I really should not be nitpicking :-)"
3,Ski instruction,I ordered a couple of his books and while one may be interesting they are kind of redundant. If ordering just try one first.
3,interesting curio,This is by Xit before they were Xit it is interesting but not in the same league as Xit first two brilliant albums.
2,Just a note to Akina Vasil....,"Okay, book four of the thoroughbred series is Ashleigh's Victory; Ashleigh's Dream is book five. Furthermore, Ashleigh was barely 16 when she rode Wonder in the Breeder's Cup, she WOULD, in fact, have been around 18 or 19 when she was racing Pride.Oh yes, and this book was rather pointless as well. Ugh!! I have never liked Christina to start and this is yet another example of her egotism. Why does Christina always think she is right? Mind, I bet Star could have benifited from time on the trails, maybe a short gallop outside."
2,Lacking... Seriously,"Actually, the author wasn't Alice Leonhardt, it was Mary Newhall Anderson.That said, I did not find this book awesome or great because for me, the book was rather lacking in many extremes. While it could have been worse, it also could have been much much better. I felt there were too many inconsistencies with the past books of the series, as well as inconsistencies with previous books by the same author. For example ... contrary to Derby Fever, Cind has ridden in the Belmont as stated in Fallen Star. I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading the book -- it has it's good points, but it's certainly not the best the series has produced."
4,Star and Chistina,"This was a really good book! But, Chis should not question her mom's skill! Her mom knows what's she's doing! It was really sad that Raven got hurt. But, in the end when Chis and Mel had thier ""Derby prep race"" it ended on a great note. I can't wait to see who wins the Kentucky Derby! GO STAR AND CHISTINA!!!"
4,I loved this book!!,I loved this book but the only thing I hated was it didn't havethe derby.When is the Derby ever going to get here?I hope its inthe next book.
2,A hoax,I really wanted to like this toy! My son seems to like it so far but we've only had it for a few hours and I know it's going to fall apart soon. I'm an architect and can tell you these pieces are not handpainted. They are printed pieces of computer generated images adhered to the softest wood known as MDF. There is nothing hand made about this product- it has been laser cut and printed. I could have made this for two dollars! A beautiful concept but very poor execution-- not handmade at all! Spend your money on the more expensive wooden toys made with safe materials and longer lasting better sanded wood. I'm taking this product back!
2,Surface Stickers Come Off Easily,"I got this as a gift and my son was very excited to play with the animal shapes. He is younger than 2 years so maybe I should have waited to give it to him but I did. Very soon after he started playing with the pieces I noticed that the alligator's nose had already come off. If you are going to buy this, wait until your child stops putting everything in his/her mouth or it won't last very long."
4,Too easy,"Too easy for my toddler. Shouldn't have pictures painted on of what they are. Thick pieces though, so they make cute little animal figures to play with and they can stand."
2,Cheap in price and quality,"This looks nice and I was exited when it arrived. However, the pieces look like particle board and the animal stickers come off too easily. It's almost like the picture just melts off. Compared to other toys, this puzzle just doesn't hold up to regular use by a toddler. My daughter is not overly hard on her toys. All my Plan Toys still look great, sadly, not Melissa and Doug. Save your money."
2,"Lions & Tigers & Tears, oh my!","I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off."
5,Relocation by XIT,"A master work from my favorite group XIT.This is how ""Native Music"" music supposes to sound! I have really enjoyed this CD, and some of the songs are in a class by itself: ""Sunrise Vision"", ""Relocation"", and ""Sweethearted Love Song"".These CD is to be recommended, belong in all good collections!"
5,Riboflavin was recommended by physician,My physician recommended that I take vitamin B-2 100mg twice a day. I found this product from Swanson to be just what the doctor ordered. The product is excellent and the service and delivery were the best I have ever found online.Vitamin B-2 (Riboflavin) 100 mg 100 Caps
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"These B-2 vitamins were exactly what I needed. I had a lot of trouble trying to find these in local stores, so I came to Amazon. The price was perfect for what I got. The capsules are really easy to swallow, as well."
5,Brilliant,"This is probably my favorite book on Theater style and one of my most precious posessions. Russell shows and discusses the relationship of period style, artistic choices and historical mind sets of all the art forms from architecture to music, from styles of clothing to history and discusses how they connect. He gives you a sweeping yet specific understanding of every age, then brings that understanding into the theater of the day.I am appalled that this book seems to be out of print. If you find it in a used book store and it is under $50, buy it!"
2,3 Primary Colors + 1 Brown,"There are three primary colors: Red, Blue, and Yellow! Brown a Primary Color??? NOT![...]Including the brown is a manufacturing ploy. Charge for 4 when there are really only 3.The package should not be marketed as Primary Colors. Because of the packaging I gave this item a 2.That being said, the yellow (which is what I needed) is terrific!"
4,About as good as PS2 can get,"Im a pretty picky gamer. I have found very few games interesting enough to finish. I finished this one. I really didnt think it was too difficult to learn or to get through. I dont like the cutscene length, I timed one at nearly 30 minutes!! However, this game was very fun. I have played many of the FF series and I think this one holds its own against those."
5,best rpg for ps2!,"this game is good for people who like games that you can play for a long time. the back of the game says ""more than 100 hours of gameplay""."
2,an okay game not a waste but not really worth your time either.,"ok to start off i loved this game when i first got it,it was way fun, and the thought of 100+ hours of that fun seemed impossible... it was, the game was a balst in the begging, finding new charecters and equipment, and getting new skills on the flow chart(alot like the liscense board in FFXII) and wepon synthesis. but all the fun quickly became repetative and the super long dunjuns were mega not fun and the occasional enemy that needs to be shot with the shield breaker gun just so you can kill it was really annoying, the only reason this game is 100 hours + is because of the lame stuff you will end of doing over and over and over, and soon you begin to realize how lame the story is... i mean omg it sucks but i dont want to spoil it for you."
4,Fun,"I played this game last summer in 2009, and it was a lot of fun. The dungeons can be a bit repetitive, but still, it's an overall solid rpg and a lot of fun to play."
4,"It's fun, replayability is a bit short but still... fun.","While this games steals the general design, concept and storyline of final fantasy-isk games, this one actually managed to make it work reasonably well, unlike some games every single person you come across does not have a vital role to play in the ongoing saga... and i'm okay with that, the vast majority actually have some rather bland statements about what you can only assume is a boring everyday life... much like the normal everyday person one would meet on the street.in all this was a reasonably fun game to play."
1,Beware rogue disc pressing,I would like to be able to review this game but it does not play.I assume this is due to a faulty press when manufacturing the disc.So be aware when buying you too may end up with one that does not play.All I can say is great cover shame no game
2,Won't Hold A Charge,"I think the title says it all. The battery will not hold a charge; therefore, the light does not stay on but about ten minutes."
2,Does not hold a charge long...,"We are disappointed in this light as it does not last very long on a single charge. Husband's job requires a steady use of a flashlight so dependability is must. We are very satisfied with another Dorcy rechargeable LED flashlight, but this one fails the mark for us."
1,defective,"I purchased this spotlight to replace an old one, only to find out it won't work. I can't return it because of the battery inside it. So I'm out the money. Would have been better to get it @ Home Depot where they will exchange it. That's all I want, is an exchange."
2,Warning!,"I purchased the Dorcy 41-1097 Pistol Grip Spotlight and plugged it into an electrical outlet that works properly. Within two minutes of charging the Spotlight I began smelling a strange smell - something like burning plastic. I unplugged the Spotlight and when I grabbed the handle of it, it felt abnormaly warm, and when I smelled the unit I realized that the ""burning plastic"" smell was coming from the spotlight. There is a little rattling noise in the handle of the unit but I think the Spotlight was defective and don't think that it was damaged during shipping because it was secure in the box that it was shipped in, and there was no damage to it. I'm just glad that I noticed the smell right away - something like this could have led to a house fire."
3,Dorcy 41-1097 1 Million Candle Power Rechargeable Pistol Grip Light,"I thought the light would be brighter than listed. However, it's o.k.....and the light gets out far enough to show anything ahead of me."
1,Very Poor Quality spotlight,Very long charge time (many hours) with very small light time (few minutes) Spend your money on a light made anywhere but China ....................... Will never buy another Dorcy light. What a waste of $20.00
4,Great undies!!!,"I bought these underwear as a gift for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loved them (as did I). They fit perfectly in all the right places, and they couldn't look better. I just wish they had more colors to choose from!"
5,INSPIRING STORIES OF WOMEN,I really enjoyed reading this book especially because it is about real women and their stories. Some stories brought me to tears and others made me feel that I could make a difference in the world. It is well written and an easy read. Thanks to Alexis Powers for finding these women and telling us about their remarkable lives.
5,Echoheat heat gun,"When I received this heat gun I wasn't sure I liked it because I was use to a Leister commercial gun which I am now selling on eBay. The more I use this budget type heat gun the more I like it. I wish it had a cool down setting but I knew it didn't when I ordered it. I use a heat gun to form heavy plastic, heat shrink tubing, and remove large pressure sensitive labels. This gun does all of the above with ease. If you are looking for a low price heat gun with a case and attachments you can't go wrong with this gun."
4,Good movie,"Good movie, especially for a relatively low budget production. Unexpected twist at the end.DVD arrived in good physical condition, and proper packaging."
1,Save your money,"As this is the only review of this product, I'd refer people to the many negative reviews of the 250gb La Cie on Amazon. I had this drive for only two months when it started having problems. At just over a year, it had completely died, losing me about 12 hours of video footage, which took me two weeks to re-digitize. La Cie was arrogant in its reponse to my phone calls, refusing to even consider replacing it (as it was just over warranty)and offering me no assistance. ""Ten percent of all drives fail"", was the response. The 400 is actually two Western Digital 200gb drives--I know this, because when I tried desperately to retrieve its data, the person who opened the case said that with two drives (at RAID 0)there would be no way to retrieve the data, as it was scattered over the two drives. I recognize that drives fail, but it would be nice if a company stepped up to the plate and backed its product in some way."
5,"Secret Remedy Book, The story or Comfort and Love",A gentle book to let your kids in on 'comfort' from home. Especially good for when the 'grow up' and leave home.
1,Avoid at all costs!,"This -- unfortunately -- is a terrible book. It is badly in need of editing. It is obvious from the authors' introductory chapter that their command of the English language is marginal at best. It would have helped to have a native English speaker review the manuscript before publication.Even worse, the level of the contributed papers varies so widely that this book cannot serve as either an introduction or as a survey for knowledgable readers. I was hoping that at least one paper would explain the basics of conjoint analysis. But most of the authors either avoided technicalities, or else assumed that readers were already familiar with the model and its variants. Not one of them bother to explain the terminology, to write down a model clearly and succinctly, and to explain how the analysis works.Overall, this was quite a disappointing book"
4,Love this for more Body!,"This shampoo is awesome. I have a somewhat naturally greasy scalp which weighs my hair down. After 2 weeks of use, my hair was noticeably lighter and showing more body. My only complaint is the price- it bounces around a lot!"
5,thank goodness for amazon,"This book is hard to find in bookstores - in fact I've never seen it. What a loss to the general reading-to-their-children public. I must have read it two hundred times and my kids still love it. And so do I! The British author sneaks enough subtle wit into this story of a pathologically greedy dachshund to satisfy the most jaded bedtime reader, and the humor is as often in the delightfully laid-back drawings as in the laconic prose. Note to publisher - distribute more widely. Note to author - hurry up and write another one."
4,Omnivorous canine charms,"Alastair Taylor crafts a wry but overwritten tale of a greedy dachshund with the unusual name Swollobog (read the opening pages to find our the origin of this fantastic moniker),a dog that eats, well, anything and everything.The prose sometimes seems a bit much, the plot veers almost to the brink even for kids, but the illustrations are a delight. Sometimes the exaggerations carry a page, sometimes the subtle rendering of an expression.This story is good fare for those 9 years and younger (as long as they are not so suggestible that they try some of Swollobog's eating techniques), but the drawings are for all ages."
5,Love it!,"I am so excited to have this Totseat! I already have a great seat that attaches to the table, very secure, but it is bulky and annoying to put together and take apart. Some people complain that the baby sits too low, but many restaurants have booster seats available, which could be used for the baby to sit higher. I think its super cute comfortable for the little one."
5,Very handy portable chair,"What a great idea. We have used this seat a few times - we visit grandma's house and she doesn't have a high chair, so this works great. Very easy to put together and to adjust, and it's also very easy to clean - just throw it in the washer.One thing to watch for, though, is that there is no padding behind baby, so if the chair has a hard back and baby gets excited, they could hit their head. We remedied this by putting a thin pillow or blanket between the totseat and the chair.Still a highly recommended product. you can't beat its portability and convenience."
3,Easy to tip over chair,"I bought this for traveling without a car. It's super-portable and well made.If your child like to push off with their feet, watch out! My daughter tipped over in a split-second during our first use. I was right there next to her, but I wasn't fast enough to stop the fall. After that I always kept either my foot on the base of her chair or my leg behind the chair. No freedom for the parents but still better than having her in my lap."
1,Not the best,"I thought this was a brilliant idea, but when I received the product, it was not great. The materia was mediocre, and the chair sagged a bit. I would not waste my money on this. I wish I spent a few more dollars and gotten the portable chair that hooked onto the table instead."
3,Not as expected,"I was really hopefully when ordering this, but unfourtantly after trying it on a few different chairs it comes up way too high on my little guy to the point where it restricts his arm movement. He is 8 months old and 95 percentile in height so it's not like he's too little for it. I was really hoping this would have worked :-("
2,Useless if your tot likes to eat at the table,"I tried this totseat with my nearly 9 month old. It is a great harness if you need to keep them in place, but does not work with an average table and chair set. We like to offer puffs or mashed fruit at the table - this offers no place to put them. The baby sits on the regular seat and is, therefore, too low. I will be looking for something with a tray. I honestly see no point to this product."
4,Uneasy,"Great idea, but makes me nervous! Does what it suppose, but I am always afraid my baby is going to sift his weight and tip over. So far so good."
3,Pretty good,"We got this to travel with our infant son. It worked well for the most part, but didn't fit on some larger round wooden chairs at my parents house. I was a little bummed about that, but other than those chairs it has worked on all others tried. Great for travel"
4,"Convenient, portable","I bought this for my 11 month old son for our various holidays on the road, at the cottage and general eating out. It is extremely portable and fits in your purse, no problem. I can even easily get the seat folded back into the little carry-bag it came with. It's simple to use, and adjustable for different seats. I used it at a firends house for dinner with no hassel. I even used it on a plastic chair at an outdoor event, where there were no highchairs available. Baby likes sitting in it, it's pretty secure and makes it easy to dine at a table without causing a fuss. My one problem is that it sits baby too low for table...I'm not sure what you are supposed to do about that. Also, many restaurants we go to have booths, so this seat can't be used in that way. It would be good if it also doubled as a high-chair cover."
2,Okay if your kid doesn't mind being hidden,Technically this harness seems to work okay. It fits chairs and keeps the kid in place. But my daughter ended up sitting so low compared to the table that she didn't like it. It would work best if you happened to have a chair that was unusually high for your table.
3,always creates a conversation,"i really like the idea of this seat, but it only works when my 11 month old is more calm. if she has a lot of energy she can just stand up, which kind of defeats the purpose of the chair. but we still use it, i don't feel like we wasted the money.o it also is quite the conversation piece in restaurants!"
5,Very portable and safe,"The totseat has been everywhere and the baby loves it. It's very secure and I don't agree at all with the other reviewer that tehe baby can slide down or tip over. You have to make sure, of course, that the chair itself is stable, but that's a no-brainer. Also, the Totseat's belt has to go through the two loops in the back and then fastened. That allows the baby to keep his/ her balance because the weight of the baby is held up that way. When you unhook the baby, you have to hold the baby in the process. I think that is how the other reviewer's baby fell/ slipped down. But that is also a no-brainer - whenever you take your baby out of anything, whatever it may be, you have to hold on to your little one.Totseat a brilliant invention, really. And the price is very reasonable. I definitely recommend this product."
5,Loved it!!,Very nice and not cheap looking and will use at my wedding. Shipping is expensive though. The cost is great. Would recommend to someone else.
5,Much better than its reviews would indicate!,"It's very sad that a lot of readers who have reviewed this book have been unable to get past their beliefs to give this book an honest review. If you are an animal rights type, who believes that dogs are ""fur people"" or that chimps experience life the same as humans, this book is not for you. If you have a genuine curiosity for interesting research and theory, and aren't totally blinded by animal rights rhetoric, you will love this book!!"
1,I totally disagree with this book this.,I totally disagree with this book. I disagree that animals don't have feelings. I had experiecne so badley that animals have feeling. If you want argue some more I can about this. But I disagree with this Author thanks for let me review this book about my name is Krishna Baker.
4,Vivaldi: Concertos for the Emperor,Vivaldi: Concertos for the Emperor is a very fine recording with the immensly talented Andrew Manze leading the The English Concert. The English concert as a work is nowhere as refined as his magnum opus four seasons. It is very beautiful no doubt about that but it lacks the depth that four seasons has. Harmonia mundi has done a great job with the book-let and the pictures are quite good except one. I hate the photo of the musicians on ladders. What is up with that? It just does not work and looks desperate. The essay written by Manze is very informative and well-written. On the whole I give this recording 4 out 5 stars.
1,Awful!,"I believe this entire CD ran amok. I don't know if was the English concert, Vivaldi, or the conductor. It seems flattering that Vivaldi catered to the Emperor. I am a huge fan of Vivaldi and for some reason this one seems to have come out too fast and synthetic..."
2,Not up to Petroski's usual high standard,"I am a great fan of Henry Petroski, engineering professor and author of such minor classics as The Pencil and The Evolution of Useful Things. Perhaps it is because of these high expectations that I was so disappointed by Engineer of Dreams: Great Bridge Builders and the Spanning of America. In the end, Petroski seems much better at writing about engineering artifacts - pencils, paper clips, or, in this book, bridges - than the makers of those artifacts. Much of Petroski's ""biography"" here seemed nothing less than mere formula: you could almost see him filling in his computer template for ""name, date and place of birth, school, mentor, etc."" each time a new engineer was introduced. Further, he did not even attempt to vary the template from person to person, so that the repetitive style becomes unmistakable. This book is worth reading insofar as it provides a history of the bridges themselves, and the limits of engineering technique and imagination."
5,Book evokes a sense of wonder,"Engineers of Dreams is a book I've read several times because it involves me in the history behind some of engineerings greatest triumphs... and failures. The story of great engineers with various combinations of vision and practicality, as well as perseverence in all cases, makes for a kind of drama. In some cases, we know how the story ended, with a great bridge we can see. In other cases, the story ends with a wreck and bodies. From the story of the San Francisco Bay Bridge to the story of the first Quebec Bridge, this book itself spans a range of ability and satisfaction that is a joy to perceive."
5,A great journey,A wonderful journey into the playful and visionary mind of a very talented American young Woman. Should not be missed by anyone who loves the art of poetry!
4,The Best of Its Kind,"In a lifetime of professional work in the field of fisheries, I have never read a book so complete, informative and lucidly written as Rupert Watsons ""Salmon, Trout and Charr of the World"". Watson has written for fishermen, environmentalists and all concerned with preserving the remarkable group of species that form the group. He is thorough, complete,and with remarkable photographs and charts. He has personally consulted authorative experts in his extensive travels throughout the Northern Hemisphere and followed member species of the group wherever they appear south of the Equator.His language and explanations are easily understood by non-professionals, and have passed reviews by outstanding authorities. His chapters on Pacific Salmon, Atlantic Salmon, Rainbow and Steelhead Trout are particularly valuable for those of us in the United States and Canada who are concerned with the welfare of salmon resources and the pressure on their essential freshwater environments.,"
3,Better books out there,"I had previously bought the book by Clair Davies which is excellent but I wanted more in-depth knowledge. Saw the reviews on this book and ordered it. The cost of the book was definitely not worth the extra information. This book was 3 times the cost of the Clair Davies book with only slightly more useful information. Save your money, buy the Clair Davies book. Or if you really want in-depth knowledge and price is not a factor, buy the 2 volume set by Travell and Simons."
5,A Superb 'Hands-On' Manual,"It is with great pleasure that I write this review and strongly recommend this 'new-approach' book to any PT, OT, Chiro, MD or Massage Therapist.Not only does it have a great amount of theoretical detail, but VERY EASY and effective cinical applications . This is esp. helpful in a medical system that is surely not getting easier! This book offers great help in that it is a 'Hands-On-In-The-Cinic' Manual that IS USED, believe me!Keep this up Dr. Kostopoulos and Rizopoulos. You have set the bar a notch higher with your effort.Can't wait for the next book!A Satisfied PT-customer."
5,One of the best clinical books I have ever read!!!,This is one of the best books I have read in Trigger Point Therapy. It includes color illustrations and pictures for each technique described. I found very helpful the home exercises and I use the pictures to explain to my patients what they should do. The literature and research section is well written and easy to understand. I would recommend this book for everyone interested to learn or learn more about myofascial dysfunction.
1,Not advisable for massage students!,"Unless you are a doctor, chiropractor, or clinician, this book is NOT for you. Especially if you are a student of massage therapy. The blocky, often illegible graphics, along with extremely compacted information will confuse rather than help someone who is new to trigger point and myofascial therapy. The compact and highly technical information is only good if you have a really strong background in medical terminology. Students, I suggest looking for a different book.You will also find that the pages in this book easily fall out, and there are a LOT of mistakes in the review questions (they often give you the wrong answer in the answer key). Please consider buying another book."
4,Nice watching,A nice sci-fi movie combines Chinese fairtales with a modern reality while fighting demon of the past in contemporary France.Nice watching.
5,Great absorbing lotion,"I have very dry skin, this product pretty much handles my dry skin issues, moisturizes deeply and not oily or greasy. Smells wonderful (the lavender)"
2,"This is not romantic, nor is it a comedy","I have a very hard time believing much of what has been said in the reviews about this dumb movie. It is not romantic. It is not funny. I didn't laugh once. Eight people make a mess of their lives, screwing each other over and not being able to tell the difference between love and lust. Alan, Jon Tenney's character, is an ass. Saffron Burrows character, Zoey, is a sociopath. I can't believe this is described as ""a hilarious comedy."" Really? Name one funny scene or line. I dare you!"
4,Back to the eighties!,"Interesting talkfest that is somewhat unique; some of the characters are likeable, some are not. Overall, I found it engaging."
5,As Powerful as an Avalanch,"This is a great CD! I am a big Avalanch fan and can safely say that buying this CD is not a waste of money even if you don't speak Spanish (If you speak Spanish and are into heavy metal - you need to have this). The music is amazing and it isn't your garden variety heavy metal band that plows ahead sounding the same with every track. They mix it up and get melodic and ferociously heavy. The drum tracks and vocals are my personal favorite. Listening to these guys is like listening to a Spanish Dream Theater except less Yes-like. Where Dream Theater is a heavy metal Yes these guys take the melody and heaviness of Dream Theater, but extract all the Yes overtones. This is just one of many records from this band which tours mainly in Spain. If you really want to explore them even more try looking at CDbaby.com for more of an extensive catalog."
2,Disappointing in its most important feature.,"Overall this Suncast 3 drawer utility storage cabinet is just OK. I was very disappointed in its storage capacity. Overall it's rather large - 20"" deep on the outside. However, the genius that designed this made the actual drawers only 14.75"" deep inside. So you lose over 5"" of space. So you buy this large cabinet but can't fit large items into any of the drawers!I like the fact that is has a large continuous and flat (as opposed to annoying legs) base and that there are rollers for the drawers (albeit plastic).Overall, if you want to store alot of stuff or large items like large power tools, etc. I would not recommend this."
5,Excellent inexpensive choice for storage,"It looks good enough to be used in the kitchen as a small pantry. I chose the gray color which coordinates with the brushed stainless appliances in use. It's strong enough that I have my microwave on the top as I did with my previous wooden cabinet which had been used for the same ""pantry"" function.Suncast 3 Drawer Utility Storage Cabinet #C3703G"
4,Great Starting Point,"The first 2/3 of the book (chapters 1-11) are great. A superb overview of many testing techniques helpful to a software tester. A superb ""tool collection"" for a software tester's tool box.The last 1/3 of the book (chapters 12-16), it seems to lose focus a bit. Concepts started being tainted with business paradigms and tedious coverage of items that could have easily just been referenced only.Overall, though, I do love the book and see it as a valuable resource to keep around. :-)"
2,Idealized,"The screenplay to this production was written by someone wishing to portray the Kennedy women as strong & independent in their own rights. Given the recent releases of some of her old interviews in which Jackie stated that her opinions were pretty much given to her by JFK, and the shock expressed by Caroline's daughters in learning that their grandmother was the antithesis of a liberated woman, it is difficult to make that case with Jackie. Recalling Joan's bouts with alcoholism as a result of her marriage to Ted the words strong & independent do not fit so well. Perhaps Ethel was the exception, but I suspect she was very much the traditional housewife. With Joan, who was not so strong, & Jackie, who was anything but independent, we are being asked to empathize with people who were privileged and wealthy, and somehow relate to their stories. This is hard to do."
4,Remarkable book.,"This book incorporates the visual effects of the bright colors of the Maya architecture,with a written text relating to the meaning of colors used in their painting. I found this to be not only a visual but a literary depiction of the Maya pople. I enjoy this book very much"
5,beautiful images,"Simply lovely color photographic images made in South America by a Monterey photographer with a fine eye. The color combinations, created by villagers, are amazing."
5,"Just what you expect, works fine.","This is about as simple as it gets. The cable is what the description says it is, and it works just fine."
3,Did it's job.,"I bought this to extend the reach of a speaker so I could set a speaker on either side of my bed. (I listen to relaxation music while I am falling to sleep.) Even though the wire here is only 10' long, there is significant signal loss and the speaker connected to the extension is quieter. I've tried it on both speakers/speaker outputs so I know it's the wire, not the speaker or the stereo. It's not a deal breaker for me because I usually fall sleep quickly, but keep this in mind if you don't have a balance control and you think it will bother you."
5,Perfect For Home Theater !,"I recently purchased a Home Theater surround sound system online. The cords to the rear speakers were extremely short, nowhere near what I needed to put the speakers to the rear of the room. Bought two of these and they worked perfectly ! And they arrived so fast I was amazed ! If you need to extend the cords to your rear speakers these are perfect !"
3,You get what you pay for,"The quality of these extenders is lower than what you'd find at Best Buy or Target but they are dirt cheap. They did result in quite a bit of sound degradation in the speakers I hooked them up with but for the price, I can't really complain.They get the job done, but if you're interesting in preserving sound quality, you'd better aim for higher quality."
5,Works as Advertised,"This worked as stated in the description, I haven't had any issues yet and I would rate the sound quality relatively good."
2,Too Much Loss For Length,I ended up returning this RCA extension cable because I was getting too much loss on the speaker that it was extending. I purchased a 6-footer of the same configuration and it worked perfectly. Kudos to Amazon for letting me send back this cable for a full refund.
5,Does what it should,I have been using this for a week or so and have had absolutely no problems; it does what it should. If I ever need another RCA extension cord this is the one I'm getting.
3,Extension cord,"This cord was a good length, and would probably work well as an extension speaker cord for the right speaker. However, the end of the speaker wire on my computer could not be connected to this extension (they were close in size, but not quite a match), so I cannot comment on how it works."
2,What is in this?,I have looked everywhere and can't seem to find any sort of description of what's in this stuff. It would be better if you could tell us...
5,inspiring,"Jane's books have always held my attention. I am not a great reader. I did not grow up reading. These books capture me in a world that is unfamiliar but yet so familiar. I read and carry the story around daily as if I was living in the history of it all. Most of the stories get right to my heart, however, this particular one has been a tear jerker as I have two sons of which Paul and Baptiste remind me of. One of which is not gone but lost to me emotionally. This book has helped me to understand my mistakes and let God heal me. I also learned I can only put my sons in HIS hands. I thank Jane for her insight, which is God driven and Blessed."
5,Praise for history with profound insight,"Jane Kirkpatrick's compassionate insight brings history to life. I always feel as if I am part of the lives of her characters, and feel a sadness when the story ends, as if I am saying goodbye to friends. This trilogy based on the life of Marie Deroin is no exception. Although highly honored for her part in history, she was undoubtedly human as we all are, and her commitment to family is close to my own heart as a woman, daughter, wife, mother, and friend.I now have my sisters ""hooked"" on Jane's novels."
4,Plot Summary,"Vijay Agnihotri is very wealthy. He has been brought up by his mother, Mrs. Padma Agnihotri, and she has allowed him everything and more that he has asked for. Vijay falls for Shivani, an air-hostess. He tells his mother about his love, and his mother agrees to get him married, only to find out that Shivani has no similar feelings for Vijay, and she eventually gets married to a air-line pilot, Ashok Chopra). Vijay is unable to accept this rejection and continues to pursue Shivani, even when he finds out that Shivani is happily married and has given birth to a daughter, Pinky. Where will Vijay's obsession lead him?"
4,Gonna really miss these guys,"I saw these guys live 5 years back in a little small club, and they had a huge effect on me, great performers no doubt. If I had to pigeon hole their sound here, it would be goth-blues. Which, sounds like an unlikely combination but these guys take you to some really dark places. If you ever thought that blues rock can only sound like bad Clapton and Led Zep cover bands you are in for a rude (but enjoyable) awakening. The lyrics are great in their sometimes subtle nods or way they can dance around a description but in so doing paint a haunting picture. ""Back to Colma"" ""Black etc"" ""Mortician Suit Drag"" (the singer actually is one) are great songs and their cover of ""St. Louis Blues"" just knocks it outta the park. Put this on, drink some absinthe and just let this just slowly sink in..."
3,"Beautiful, but SMALL!","I was not disappointed in how this bedding set looked -- I might have some concerns about snags in the fabric had I kept it. I knew I was taking a chance on the sizing as no dimensions for the comforter were offered. Most ""oversized"" sets are about 2 inches short on our bed, but this one barely covered the top of our bed! I would love to see the queen sized bed that this comforter fit on perfectly! Would have been a really great deal!"
3,"For the price it is great! Not the best quality, but very pretty!","Yes there are a few loose threads, but c'mon ppl its embroidered, what do you expect. I love the colors and the cute accent pillows. It won't last forever, but at Walmart for that price you can only get a comforter!I am pleased with the over all appearance and the amount of items included. The bed skirt needs to be sewn b/c I tried to pull it out a bit while the matress was on top of it. Obviously not the brightest idea.Note: the loose threads should not be pulled out, cut them off!"
3,A good deal if on sale,"I just purchased this set. The colors are nice, but I have already noticed a few loose threads after just one week.I plan to buy another set next. I am not sure if this set will last much longer than that."
5,A very pleased customer,Place my order and got the product quickly as promised and it was just what I was looking for at a great price. Looking forward to doing more business this way.
5,Great Product,"This is the second one I've purchased. That is about the best recommendation someone can give. The plugs are laid out well, space for power bricks, and just solidly constructed. The form factor is nice compared to the generally boring straight power strips."
2,Not what I excepted from APC,The contacts that touch the plug ends were made so tight (narrow) that I couldn't get the plugs into the sockets. I ended up breaking one of the contacts trying to push the plug in the socket. Found myself taking the housing apart to separate them a little so the plug could fit between them. Also had to bend some of them straight so they were not touching the opposite row so not to create a short. Definately was not expecting this type of shoty work from APC.
5,Does what its supposed to,"Right now all the jacks (except 2) are being usedits getting kind of clutteredbut this is doing the job, I just need something to make it look less sloppyI might invest in a surge protection box so all these cords wont be all over the place"
2,Not adequate as a test prep tool.,"Many of the earlier (low) reviews are right on. Avoid this book and buy New Rider's book covering both exams (175 and 176). Also get the www.transcender.com practice exams. This book's sample questions are nothing like the real thing. The packaging and deployment is a large area of the exam - this book doesn't come close to preparing you for that. This book is okay as a supplement, but you won't pass if this is all you read."
2,Inadequate for the test,I primarily studied for the exam by using this book. I felt I knew the material very well and was surprised to find the exam very different and considerably harder than the study questions (although I thankfully still passed). There were questions on the exam that the book hadn't even mentioned. The book covers most of the material on the exam and you should know the material in this book for the exam. Its weakness is that it is insufficiently deep is many areas. The Package and Deployment Wizard sections were particularly weak. I would definitely supplement this book with some other study materials such as the Transcender tests.
2,Not EXAM prep,I am very new to VB but managed to pass the exam. I used both this book and the training kit from MSPress to prepare. I have to agree with many of the comments were people say that the material is not covered in sufficient depth. The questions in the exam are of a different nature and much tougher than the examples in the book. Packaging and deploying are not covered in any where near the depth needed for the test. For that matter the MSPress book wasn't much better. What really helped me was finally reading extensively in the VB programmers guide and MSDN. If this book was to be reviewed from the angle of learn the basics I would give it a higher rating. But as a tool for getting you through the exam it rates very low. You have to use other material.
2,Get 50% of the real thing,"This book is OK for reading and learning the basics. The depth of Exam objectives cover by this book isn't enough. VSS is almost forgotten in this book. P&D was too far simplistic never got into the real exam questions scenarios. Use this one as a starter practice with transcender to get 20% more knowledge. The key to this exam is experience, actual programming scenarios. If you are new to VB, it might take you a while to get certified."
1,Dismally Inadequate,"The cover of this book says ""Everything You need to Prepare for - and Pass - Exam 70-176"". It doesn't come close ! The book contains a large number of errors, but its worst failing is that it is far too simple. I got halfway through the book and in my frustration decided to check what else was on offer through Amazon. It wasn't a great surprise to see all the other poor reviews of this book, but I also fortunately read many recommendations for the New Riders book for VB 6. I bought it and can wholeheartedly recommend it (it covers both 70-175 and 70-176)."
3,Lacking for the exam,"I was starting from scratch with this as my main reference. I was annoyed by the errors in the book, not all of which are corrected on the Sybex web site. I also couldn't find things that the book said were on the accompanying CD.. I'm sure they are not there. It is lacking in the package and deployment area and I had to use ""Programming Components with Microsoft VB6"" (2nd edition) from Microsoft Press to understand more of COM EXE & DLL. I found the MSDN Library CD to be very helpful with Package & Deployment. I also bought some sample questions because the ones in the book are easier than the real thing. These together did the business, the book alone, for the inexperienced, will not."
2,"OK for reviewing unfamiliar aspects, but not good exam prep","My feelings about this book are very similar to the ""reader from Chicago"" who posted a review on July 7th, 1999. Basically, this book is adequate for brushing up on aspects of VB that you rarely or never use, but the text is not a good exam preparation tool. The book has too many errors that are not noted on the errata site and the review questions bear little resemblance to those on exam 70-176. The Transcender exam simulations that I purchased were a far more useful tool for exam preparation -- at least 1/3 of the questions on the actual exam were near duplicates of questions on the Transcender practice tests. I'm not completely disappointed that I bought this book because I did learn a few things that I can use in my job, but without another prep tool, I doubt that I'd have passed the exam."
1,Misses The Mark,"This book definately misses the mark. It's a good reference manual at best for some basic things that you don't use often. The example questions are nothing like the exam, being more vb trivia questions than anything else. It's only benefit is it could be a starting point for a beginner. If your an intermediate level or better vb'er look somewhere else, there is not enough here to get you through the test unless you have 3+ years of vb experience.To bad..."
3,A good start,"This book was missing content about the Package and Deployment Wizard and VCM. A good percentage of the exam is about Deployment, how can they miss this. Only a quick touch on VCM. Good thing I have been programming with VB for 5 years or I don't think this book would allowed me to pass by itself. A supplement is needed to pass this exam, experience!!!!!"
4,Good test prep,"I used this book and the Mastering CD to prepare for the test and passed easily. Ther were a few errors I identified, but not enough to be a problem. The test prep software on the CD was effective in targeting the MS exam questions except for one or two areas (not much on source safe). Overall, you can spend $140 on an exam simulator or get this book for a lot less."
1,A good book,"The contents of this book is not enough, don't trust the questions in the book, they are as easy as ABC and can't reflect the difficulties of the exams. How come other people can rate this book for more than 3 stars?It is a good book for arm rest only."
2,Wasted my time and money,"Picked one up and gave it a try on my in ground pool. More water splashed out of the top then went in the pool, keeps the pool deck wet all the time. Spent all weekend trying to get the unit to hang level securely and look neat, wife says trash it. I guess I can put it on the dog bowl out side. Oh well live and learn."
2,leaking and not UV resistant,"Had this model in my little garden pond for a couple of years.Very primitive assembly, was leaking very early on and the housing disintegrated quickly."
4,Works Good,"No leaks, sets up easy. Works well but I will really hold back judgement till it has lasted several years being half in the water and half out in the punishing Arizona sun."
5,Little Giant,This product is great. Even though they call it a Trough Float Valve I use it to keep my swimming pool full when we are not home. Very easy to install an looks good and takes up very little room in the pool.Product was delivered on time and packaged very good in a secure box.Gene
1,waste of time,"Not even the original members on all cuts.If you grew up listening to these guys,don't bother,you'll be disapointed."
3,Mixed feelings,"The voice and production including back up are much superior to the choice of music. Martin Greigh, the featured song, is very good - a New England sea song in the tradition of Schooner Fare and Daisy Nell. As for the other ""New England Favorites"", there is nothing to identify them as ""New England"" in fact some are directed in a definitely 'non-New England' direction. Other than the Martin Greigh, this CD was a disappointment - I would like to have Mr. Whiteside do another recording with different material. It is not that the songs were bad, but the selection was simply not what was advertised."
3,runs very big,The vest runs very large- I'm normally a medium and should have ordered a small. It also is hot to wear during warm weather.
1,poor product,This sucks! Don't get it and let me save you the money...if you want to learn the songs here (the complete songs) purchase juan serranos flamenco book 1...However I do recommend Guitar Method Books 1-3 by Hal Leonard...for any style. I give this software one star because I'm nice
4,Toy Vault Black Knight Plush Toy,"This Item is Amazing!Better than expected, I was alittle disappointed because the toy does not talk the phrases like informed, I think the mechanism inside is broken.Anyway I bought it only for decoration, them I am satisfacted.Thank you!"
2,I am severely disappointed,"The one I bought had holes in the robe, a bent saber, and scratches on his face. It's a great figure, but don't buy it used."
4,"Lord Palpatine Done Proper in the 12"" Format","At last, with Revenge of the Sith, Emperor Palpatine gets his proper respects! As a fan of Emperor Palpatine going back to the Original Trilogy, the pickings have always been slim for me. The Phantom Menace introduced Palpatine to us again as ""Darth Sidious"", and we got a new figure. However, with ROTS, we've got plenty to choose from!This 12"" figure of Palpatine/Sidious is done very well, the facial expression is done well, and the cloak is great. There is plenty of room to make the hood baggy, as Palpatine wears it as Sidious. My main complaint about this figure is the fact that he falls fairly often (Even after repositioning the legs properly), and the lightsaber. My complaint about the saber, however, is more due to the fact that I dislike that he will use one in the movie, more than the toy itself. Lucas, why did you cheapen Palpatine by making him have to get his hands dirty? That was part of this character's mystique!Overall, a 4-star figure."
3,Quick,"I received the item relatively quick, about a week or so. I haven't used it much in my class so in a sense I feel like it was a waste. That being said, I'm glad I only paid about $17 apposed to the $30 it was originally going to cost me."
3,Not what I thought it was,"I wanted a battery operated reading lamp so my husband and kids wouldn't trip over the cord while I read I read in the middle of the room. I wish I had paid better attention to what this is. It's very small and isn't strong enough to read by it comfortably. But it is a cute little lamp. One of my kids has already taken it up to his room for additional light. Not enough to read by, but enough to help him get around."
1,Not a Fan,"This thing offers very, very little light at all. About as much as a small candle really. After just two days of use, the lighting is now very randomly dim (to nearly no light at all) or sometimes just unresponsive and non-functional altogether. It's not the batteries, either, I think it's the poor design. I can't recommend."
1,Didn't work at all!,"Purchased this lamp for a camping trip in the Caribbean. Unfortunately, I didn't test it before I left. When I took it out to use it, it simply did not work. I knew I'd never find the receipt when I got home and didn't see the point of packing it back in my suitcase to bring it home so I chucked it. I was very disappointed. Luckily I had a couple of flashlights with me. The lesson: open it and test it as soon as you receive it!"
1,Total Waste,"Yes, it worked at unpacking when I first installed batteries. Now, the FIRST time I've actually wanted to use it, the return period has just expired. The on/off switch snapped and broke with the FIRST use. Cheap, cheap, cheap plastic and flimsy metal make up the switch and the entire construction."
1,Flimsy handle. Batteries leaked.,"Bought two units in August 2010 and didn't use them until now. One was ready to go when I needed it during a power outage. The other didn't work because the batteries had leaked inside. I will store the batteries separately for the one good lamp that is left. Light is bright and diffused with the shade, but the handle is very flimsy. You have to hold it by the base. Will not buy again because they are too flimsy."
1,missing part,"the lamp works well but the part that holds the shade to the lamp base was missing, making the lamp extremely hard to use."
1,Worthless Piece of Junk,Thought this would be perfect for my porch. But it's a cheap piece of junk and it doesn't work. Too bad it's not worth paying shipping to return it. Don't buy this lamp!
1,None of them worked,I thought this would be an awesome idea in case of a power outage. I put the batteries in and nothing. I bought 4 of these and all 4 were useless.
4,Make it work,"Like many reviewers I couldn't get this lamp to work. But an email to Dorcy customer support brought a quick and helpful response. When you insert the upper stem into the base be sure to turn it far enough so that the metal pieces meet. Try this with the lamp turned on and you'll know when it happens.A little tricky then, but a good bright lamp for me now."
5,Great extra light,I love this litle lamp - I use it in my vacation home & it gives off just enough light...& I can move it around where I need it.
2,"Useful in a pinch, not for everyday use","I bought this for a desk that doesn't have a nearby outlet. It doesn't really work for my intended purpose. The light is dim, the dial/switch is flakey, and it goes through batteries pretty fast. That said, I'm keeping it around for power outages. I think it will be really handy and a little more useful than a flashlight."
3,DORCY 41-1016 Portable Lamp,Must be very careful handlening it because it is heavy with 4 D batteries and try not to hold it by the hook. My recommendation is to tie the hook with a velcro strip for example. It is ok but not powerful.
1,Doesn't work and cheapl made.,Doesn't work and cheap made. Instructions for batteries not included. Not up to Amazon standards.But at least they did not make me return it.
1,Not one of the 3 ordered actually worked,"I was excited to break out my lamps that I had ordered last December when Hurricane Irene came through. Imagine my surprise when not one of the 3 that I ordered actually worked...not one. Brand new D cell batteries, even tried different sets/brands. One lamp is now ""stuck"" with the light in the base so that one I can't even get apart to put back in the box.If there was a zero star rating, this would have received it. I am irate and of course I can't return them now.....I guess the moral of the story is don't wait until you actually need your emergency lamps, go into it assuming they won't work and test them. Terrible product. Not up to Amazon standards and should be discontinued."
1,"Dorcy 41-1016 Indoor/Outdoor Table Lamp, Colors May Vary","Might have been ok if the bottom of the lamp was inside the box. The bottom of the lamp holds the batteries in. Hmmm? Someone must have been having a bad day in the shipping dept. Oh, the other one having the bottom does work... the light is a low beam. Sure it lights up the area, but please do not expect to read directions without a magnifier if your lights go out while using this lamp. It is designed only to give you what a night light puts out."
3,Cheaply made,"The idea of battery operated lamps, in the seasons of hurricanes and power outages, is a fabulous idea. However, the Dorcy 41-1016 is cheaper than cheap. It gives minimal light and is poorly made. Kids' toys are better put together. In fact, the Dorcy lamp is a toy. Don't buy, spend more money and go to a real outdoors or camping store and buy the good ones."
2,Very flimsy,"Once you put batteries in, you can't carry it by the little handle. It is made of cheap plastic & the handle just falls out. OK as table lamp in power outage but too flimsy for outdoor use. Seems bright enough though."
1,Should be no stars... It does not work and I do not have the receipt to return..,"Should be no stars, It does not work and I do not have the receipt to return..Wish I would get a replacement."
3,Not what I wanted,"Even though I viewed this product on line before ordering, it was not what I wanted. The 1994 edition I have of this book includes journaling space each day following the day's scriptures. I didn't realize this was not included until the books came. In giving this to members of my mission team, I wanted them to journal their praises to God for the 31 days. I think the journaling space makes the book so much more effective as a tool with which to praise God. The book is still very good . . . just not what I really wanted the way I wanted to use it."
5,A great way to start your day.,"I like to start out every day reading from this uplifting little book. It is straight from the Word of God, praising God, which is a life-changing thing to do. I love to give these books as gifts, so my friends can be encouraged every day too."
3,For the Kindle Edition...,"I have both the hard copy and the Kindle edition of this book. I really enjoy it, but the Kindle edition is awful. I have only read the first day of praise, but it already has four typos. I scanned through the rest of the book, and it seems like it gets much, much worse. I guess no one even checked (or glanced over) the Kindle edition at all! It is rather distracting from the reading when I get so annoyed by the many typos in the text. I am extremely disappointed with the Kindle edition."
3,Author's Opinion,"The author, by his own admission, set NO hidden undertones or hidden concepts. He wrote it, again, by his own admission, as a historical fiction so people could pull what they felt important from it."
5,awesome touch up paint,Got this and was unsure if it would match. It matched perfect and you can't even tell where the scratch was! Great product!
2,No thank you!,This book is very elementary in content. I was very disappointed and would like a refund. I have read other works by the Jafolla's and this one is notup to par with what they have written in the past. I would like to have seen some depth and more content to each chapter.
5,good food,I have an allergy dog. The dogs love venison. Love this company. A cheaper alternative than vet allergy food. a winner
4,Good product,"Hard to find grain-free dog foods at reasonable prices. I've ordered these in bulk and the dogs love it. Three happy, healthy dogs."
2,"It's not the product, it's the advertising of what you are getting","I have no issues with the product, in fact it is an excellent product and our puppies love this food, but I do object to it being represented as a case of 24 cans and being priced like 24 cans only to find out it is a ""half-case"" of 12 cans. Enough said ... it's worth it to drive 50 miles and buy from the store. This is the second provider that represents the product as a full case and delivers a half-case!"
1,Disappointed,"This book was a disappointment. It was nothing like the title would have you believe. If I wanted to read Jane Austen, I would have. I felt like I was just reading a mod podge of anything that could be found on the subject. The author was inspired by her own break up letter. Personally, I think if you have to rely on the F word over and over, you're not much of a writer and the organization (or lack thereof) of the book just underlined that fact. I wish I could get my money and my time back."
3,An Even Mix,"Hell Hath No Fury is a collection of letters written by women and the end of a relationship. The letters are grouped by themes starting with the fantastically gritty ""tell-off"" letter, some of these got very nasty. Two categories I thought stood out were the autopsy letter (the letter where we dissect everything that went wrong with the relationship) as well as the unsent letter.There are MANY letters in this book and at least half of them are snoozers or too desperate-sounding to be enjoyable reading.There are some absolute gems, though, especially some of the historical figures including a letter from Anne Boleyn (in the tower awaiting trial) to King Henry VIII. I also enjoyed the letters from Zelda, Sylvia Plath, and Sandra Bernhardt. The book is practical for subway commuting since most letters are at most a few pages long."
5,another GREAT Little Book for your body & mind,"this is the perfect book to get or stay fit and/or lose weight, this book gives you a total workout in minutes, to burn fat and calories, build muscle, and boost metabolism. It's great for the gym or home and it's the perfect size to travel with -- I'm carrying this and the Little Yoga book (same book series) so I've got all my bases covered."
5,I wish more books were written this way.,"If there's one J2EE book to use as a starting point it's this one. Boone has many working examples with useful comments in the source code.He even develops working examples of home-grown middleware to give a flavour of what J2EE is really trying to accomplish (while stripping away the complexities that accompany a mature middleware product).The example JCA 1.0 resource adapter distinguishes this book from others which assume the software developer will buy resource adapters from a 3rd-party. At some point, a software developer will have to integrate with something somewhat proprietary, and being able to see the guts of a resource adapter allows one to make better decisions about how to approach such problems."
2,Digital Swing - It Doesn't,"I've listened to a lot of Les Brown music but this album doesn't excite me. The personel lineup is impressive with Andy Martin, Jack Sperling, Matt Utal and other familiar Brown sidemen. I feel that the arrangements were somewhat weak and predictable. Solos and the album, in general, lacked energy and excitement.Brown has had much better albums such as ""Dancer's Choice"" and ""Les Brown's in Town""."
2,one percent,There are some good photos but they are mostly OUTLAWS and why in the world didn't the publisher just call it OUTLAWS MC? I was under the impression this was going to cover all 1%ers it didn't! AFFA
4,Some wild pics in here,"I LOVED the pic in the book where the HA was riding bitch with an OL!! I never knew they were that close. Great book, just wish they had captions or stories with the pics."
1,Not what it says,This is a book of the outlaw motorcycle club. I bought it for it said 1% so I thought it would have pictures in it of all the 1% clubs but it only has pictures of the outlaws club only. it is only pictures of the club on a run and with there ladies.a this is only a picture book there are no descriptions of the pictures but the picture quality is quite good most of the pictures are self explanatory
2,I think it lies....,"I know all girls say that when they have a big number on a scale, but it's not my weight I question. I'm a size 8, usually about 140 pounds, 5'4"" with lots of muscle from years of track. This scale tells me I'm about 40% body fat...I can't believe this is right since there isn't a whole heck of a lot of places on me where you can pinch out fat. It's got a lot of bells and whistles, but I wish I had saved my money and gotten a regular scale to tell me my pounds; that's the only job this scale does that I trust to be correct!"
1,Bad for body fat,This was a very disappointing purchase. I bought this scale to be able to measure and track body fat. Two out of 3 users can not receive any body fat numbers - it just displays an error. The third user gets a body fat number but it is obviously incorrect. It displays over 50% body fat...this is rated as an obese person...yet this person is fairly thin. I would not recommend purchase of this scale.
4,"Great Features, OK Accuracy","This scale includes the features we're most interested in: weight; muscle mass, body fat and body water %. We had to return the first one we bought since it had some marks from manufacturing on the digital readout panel - Amazon very promptly relaced it. It is important to moisten your feet before using it; otherwise the readouts are not accurate beyond basic weight measurement.Taylor needs to sync up their marketing and product information with their current products. Their website doesn't organize their scales by features nor do they offer comparison tables or other helpful information. So, it was only by digging that we were able to find out which scale to choose.At the end of the day, this Taylor 5598 is a good product with really nice features."
3,Not sure product works yet!,The scale has been hard to calibrate and we are still not sure whether it is actually working or not. May have to seen it back. Hard to figure out!
4,Clarification,This was originally billed as a limited edition release on colored vinyl. I wanted it regardless but the version here is IN FACT the colored (purple speckled) vinyl version. Just arrived and look forward to giving it a listen this evening.
2,trujake,A bore of a book for me. I did finish it though. Broke things down to the beginning particles which I didn't care to have a chemistry lesson. I took the class once and passed it but didn't think I would need it again until this book. Some points were good but to detailed for me. Rather a boring read.
4,Good Gloves,An excellent product. The gloves are well made and comfortable. They make it much easier to cope with the arthritis in a finger.
4,Great once I figured out how to power it,"Received this item yesterday and had to scramble in the basement for an old power adapter off a dead hdd enclosure, but once that was wired up, I connected my iPod Touch using Apple's composite AV cable, and all was well. I didn't see an obvious way to switch between AV inputs on the display itself, having instead to use the supplied remote, but that's not a huge deal. Only one dead pixel, but I can hardly complain about that at this price point."
2,"Good price, poor quality","I bought this to install as a rear display in my truck. It worked well the first few times used, then would no longer turn on. The quality of this unit is just subpar. It's worth the money to buy a better brand."
3,well...,I loved PRAY ALL WAYS by the same author so I thought I would take a look at this one. Each date is supposedly supposed to hold some meaningfull thing which the reader can reflect on but many many many of the enteries were secular and innane. I would suggest not investing the money in this one if you are looking for a completely religous almanac. If you are just looking for an interesting read then buy this one as it's not all bad and the author is noteable.
1,BEWARE_-_- These cd-rw's are of low quality.,I purchased a 10 pak of these identical cd-rw's and about everyone of them are either corrupt or have errors and are no longer of any use I.E cyclic redundancy errors...Take my advice and stay away from this blank media..they are of poor quality ..didnt even last one month...spend the extra few dollars for the higher quality media...I promise you ...you dont want to use these cd-rw's to do ANY kind of backing -up of your pc or anything else...cuz if you do use these to back up your pc (like I did ) you might as well start re-formatting and installing Windows now.....BEWARE_-_-_-
1,Damaged,THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PRODUCT WAS IT WAS DAMAGED BY THE SHIPPER FEDEX.THE SELLER AND FEDEX WHERE BOTH NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM. INSTEAD OF REPLACING THEM. I WAS REFUNDED THE PURCHASE PRICE BUT NEVER THE SHIPPING COST.
2,an ok product,"It is very shiny, but it looks fake because it has a strange coating on it to make it shiny. Swarovski crystal doesn't coat their products like that. Theirs catches lights naturally not like this one which depends on the coating. I have real swarovsski jewelry. When I wear them together, you can see great difference."
4,finally!,These omnibi have been terribly hard to find at a decent price (especially vols. 3 & 5. Arrived promptly and in great condition.thanks!
3,Tony Stewart DVD,"The DVD is fairly good. The downfall is that it is a slick, run-over of a championship season and lacks some of the real Smoke. the dvd would be a little better with more ""behind the scenes"" of NASCAR life. But if you are a tony fan, you'll enjoy it."
4,A worthy read,"Salzman bases much of her argument on quantitative data. Her main conclusion is that the aristocracy only became predominantly Christian by the reign Theodosius, some sixty years after Constantine's death, primarily because it became a way to advance in society. It is certainly a plausible, and perhaps even likely case for a complicated subject. Worth the read for anyone interested in Roman history and religion, and Christianity."
2,Not a good taste,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the taste of this is very Crisco-y. The only reason I gave it two stars is for convenience. Yes, the Wilton class will mention as many of their products as possible (which is fine, they sponsor the class, but some products are NOT good). You just have to pick and choose which products are actually beneficial for you...and some you can buy in a different brand but the same basic product. As for this icing, I plan to make my own once I am done using the one jar for my class. Actually, you are supposed to make your own batch of icing for the second class session, so maybe it will taste a little better even made with Crisco. I'm going to switch to REAL buttercream with BUTTER after the class. You can also use the 40% or 50% off coupons in the paper or online to buy the meringue powder from one of the craft stores, which is a good deal."
1,Worst icing money can buy,Please do me a favor and do not buy this icing.It's probably the worst icing i've ever tasted before. I would rather have the fake whipped cream icing (they put on the pre-made cakes) from our local grocery store then this stuff.It's got a terrible after-taste that is woody/very artificial.
4,Great for certain purposes,"To start, let me mention this- this icing is NOT for covering or filling a cake- it is much too stiff and does not thin very well. This stiff icing works very nicely for roses and sweet peas, and takes color very nicely as well. The flavor is okay-not terrible, but not necessarily remarkable, either. While I normally prefer to make all my frostings and icings myself, I seem to be unable to make an icing that works well enough for roses; not even Wilton's own recipe works for me. Too often my icing is either soo stiff that the edges are ragged and ugly (and consequently makes my roses look like cabbages), or just thin enough that the petals won't stay. So I compromise and use this icing when making buttercream roses, as it's exactly the consistency I want."
1,Bad taste,"Good for making flowers, leaves, piping; but not for frosting an entire cake. It has a waxy, stale, artifical flavor."
2,Overpriced and Not Needed,"This icing is average and unfortunately expensive. Wilton will insist that you bring this to your first class, ignore them and make it yourself. The Wilton recipe is all over the internet, is fairly cheap to make and is what you'll be making for your second class. This tastes fine, but is far too expensive for what you get.The only way I would get it again is if it were on sale because it does give you icing of the right consistency for your first cake decorating class, if you've never made icing before."
3,Reading Harry Potter: critical Essays,I was disappointed that the back cover of this book had very visible scratches on it when it arrived. It was a gift to someone so I felt it didn't reflect the price I had paid for it.
5,If you read one book...,"...read this one. Early in my wife's pregnancy, I bought Pregnant Man used for under a dollar; what a deal! It was the most useful and comforting book I read on impending fatherhood, and I have since sent it to several other pregnant (male) friends. Support the author: buy it new!"
3,A relatively good read,"As a new expactant father, this title caught my eye. I really enjoyed many part of this book. On the other hand, I think the author got a bit too technical when documenting some of his research or discussions he had. He lost me a couple of times while there were other parts that held my interest to the point of not wanting to put to the book done. All in all--- a good effort and a relatively good read!"
5,WONDERFUL!!,This book on aromatherapy and its effects is very informative as well as enjoyable. You'll learn so much about what different oils can be helpful for a variety of conditions. It also gives advice on massaging and health. WELL WORTH IT-especially for aromatherapy lovers who aren't sure how to get started with creating scents and mixing essential oils.
4,"More About Cancer, Less About Nutrition","This movie was entertaining and inspiring but not what I expected. To be fair, I thought Kris would spend more time talking about the nutritional details of her healing strategy. She covered the basics, like the importance of eating clean & raw, but most of the time was spent discussing other options she explored before finding what worked. SHE is inspiring and so is HER story, but she also introduced us to a number of other cancer patients to talk about their journeys. That wasn't as interesting to me because they are going through standard treatments as opposed to incorporating diet and exercise. But again, this review reflects my personal interests.Bottom line: If you're primarily interested in watching a documentary about cancer, this is great. If your focus is nutrition, buy Crazy Sexy Diet instead."
5,Fantastic and VERY Inspiring,"Love it! Love it! Love it!I think this documentary is one of the best. I was battling breast cancer and Chris Carr inspired me so much to change my eating habits and in turn, changed my life. This DVD is a ""must see"" for cancer patients and for anyone who wants to be inspired and empowered to ""Live"" better. I wish the whole world can see it and to make a change in their lives too."
3,Drags on in parts,"Bought this movie for 2 friends battling cancer and decided to screen it prior to giving it to them. I, as well as both friends, thought the movie was good but definitely dragged on in many parts."
2,Disappointed,I was under the impression that this documentary was uplifting. It was too depressing. A friendrecommended this to me. She said she would watch it everyday if she was going through chemo. I would not. Could have been more positive and cheery.
4,Great easy guide to CA Workers' Comp benefits,"I'm a big fan of NOLO books. In general they are well laid out, easy to read and understand, and comprehensive. While the best book on Illinois Workers' Compensation law is definitelyHow To Win A Worker's Compensation Claim In Illinois, this book is the best guide for California workers who have been injured and need advice. I would add that you're still probably best off getting an attorney, but at least you'll go into your case armed with knowledge that will help you understand what your attorney is doing, and decide whether he or she is doing a good job fighting for you."
2,Too much info.,The book is simply too much. The book is an encyclopedia of information and it is the size of a large textbook. I feel like I am studying for a microbiology exam not trying to learn about workers comp.I think a simpler book would be good for most.If you are trying to deal with a big problem or a serious injury - this might be an OK choice.Not for those of you looking for a little more info ...
3,Good Way To Waste An Afternoon I Suppose,"This book is an ok read, don't get me wrong.But Its super small!The book itself is very tiny and the text is headache inducing.Its got a lot of pictures, and its a decent book on the matter.Its a very fast read, only took me about 2 hours.If you're a beginner and just dipping your toes into the wading pool of tombstones, Then this book should be just fine for you.If you're like me and you have a bookshelf of the stuff, Keep walking.If youre wanting a really good book on the matter,I would suggest Stories In Stone."
5,A worth reading classic for youngsters.,"I read this novel written by Jules Verne when I was a teenager. If I loved reading it the old way, reading it in my iPhone Kindle has been amazing. (It's the first time I read an entire novel in Kindle version.) That's why I'm planning to buy a Kindle, because I left back my concerns about how it would be to read from a screen. My eyes get tired of the computer screen glare, it's different from a Kindle which is designed to make reading comfortable."
5,Primarily of historical interest.,"Verne wrote this novel on the basis of first-hand contemporary knowledge of the situation in Russia, which makes it of historical interest. As with many 19th century adventure novels, the plot is relatively naive by modern standards. I wouldn't spend a lot of time with this unless you are really interested in the novels of Jules Verne, or in 19th century Russia."
1,POOR QUALITY,THE PRODUCT IS VERY POORLY MADE AND WILL NOT ACTIVATE AND CLOSE THE DOOR . VERY HARD TO SET WITH A SENSETIVE TOUCH .WOULD NOT RECOMEND TO ANYONE .
2,Big trouble,"I had two of sets of these traps delivered. The first set I believe got damage in transit and the latching mechanisms for the doors on both traps were bent. I was able to get the small trap working, but the large trap the pressure plate would not come up when the trap was set. The second set I recieved, the small trap worked fine, but the large one would not set properly; again the pressure plate would not come up. In the end I gave up and bought a different trap."
1,"bad quality traps, too expensive - use hot peppers for $4","The traps are bad quality. For the price, I'd expect heavy duty shopping cart type of traps. There are videos on pest mall's web site that shows you how to set the trap and how to release the animal once you catch them. You turn it over twice with your shoe and the door opens and the animal leaves.[…]If you just want to keep some possoms or raccoons from tearing up your lawn and flower beds, then you can save a lot of money by buying $4 worth of red hot chilli powder and crushed red hot chillis and spread them around the ground. Repeat as needed."
1,Not worth buying - Not worth scrap metal,"I did read the reviews before i bought these traps, and just figured some people may have gotten some that werent the best. Apparently, i didnt get a decent one either. The trap will not catch anything!I can barely get it to catch my own arm when i put my hand in and push the release pad myself -- much less a 6 oz squirrel. All it has done is provide a place for the critters to steal my bait and laugh at me. I have tried to adjust the release rods and catches to get it to work, and made it some what better, but still doesnt even come close to the reliability of my parents made in the USA Hav-a-Hart traps.Spend the extra dollars and get one that will work. I will probably be tossing these two out with the empty bait containers and getting a good one. I am tired of being humiliated by squirrels."
3,Cat trap,"The trap came as a set of two which I didn't need, but it was cheaper than most other singles so I got it anyway. The trap was NOT easy to set, I had to modify the catch with pliers before it didn't trip with a breath of wind. BUT, after all was said and done it worked for me, so I guess I will say thanks! Budget friendly if you don't mind tweaking it a bit."
3,Great Sound Quality,"These patriotic songs are performed by artists that are meant to sound like the artists that originally performed them. This is disappointing. I would have preferred the originals, but they do sound good. The sound quality is outstanding, and easily stands up to being played at high volumes. (Also, this is is on a foreign label, out of Canada!) The second disc in this set needed not to be included, except for the first two songs. The majority of the others represent various states, and are rarely included in most sets. It is all okay for the price."
5,Great album for Veteran's Day,A nice variety of Patriotic Songs of all types including old favorites. The marches had me ready for a parade.
3,Not Enough Verve,"I was disappointed overall with this CD set. The vocalists displayed a mix of country/easy listening/crooner styles. I found it disconcerting to have strongly patriotic songs performed without much conviction, verve, or a rousing spirit. The three stars are for the overall selection of songs, which was well put together. The addition of ballads from various states was a plus."
5,this product is wonderful,I think this product is great and I'm in the process of buying yet another bottle of it. It used to come in a tub and was a little messier but the bottle is a great way to use it.I use it for greasing my bread pans and cake pans as well as muffin tins. I squirt a little into the pan and then I use a silicone brush to brush it on and there no need to use any flour. Just this one product and cakes and breads pop out of their pan perfectly.
5,Very Easy and Convenient,"I always read reviews before purchasing a product. I read where somebody suggested using equal parts of shortening, flour and oil and thought that sounded really easy. However, this product is still easier to use than making your own. I think this is an excellent product and I always have good luck with my cakes releasing perfectly. Because I am a professional home baker, I need perfection. I will not be without this product."
3,It's good but,"Used the product for the first time yesterday. It was OK but honestly, I like the grease & flour better. This Wilton Cake Release was easy to apply but I just thought it did a so, so job. I made brownies and have always greased & floured the pan, but yesterday I used this item. I thought that the brownies didn't seem as easy to come out of the pan. I also think that if you bake an awful lot, this could get kind of expensive to keep buying as compared to just using the old standby of Crisco & flour (and when necessary, wax paper). Just my opinion."
5,works great,This is perfect. It is so easy to use and makes it easy to get the cake out. huge difference
5,Doug Stone,"I am starting to upgrade my old cassette collection to CD's and am very happy to have found that by purchasing on Amazon, I get the CD's quickly and without any problems."
5,Radio play for Doug Stone,"To Gary Linger in Tx. The song ""time"" from this album is getting radio play on US97 here in Hot Springs Ar. I haven't heard the whole album yet (am about to purchase it), but the one song is exceptional (hence the 5 stars)."
3,Inspiring story with lessons beyond martial arts and BJJ...,"Jean Jacques Machado is a Brazilian jiu jitsu specialist who happened to be born with one malformed hand. Despite this, he has -- through sheer force of will -- become one of THE leading practitioners of this martial art. If this was all, there would likely be no documentary made of him. Yet, he has become a teacher, author and exemplar of what people can do by sheer determination and hard work.For a compelling profile of a modern-day ""master"" of his craft, ""The Force of the Spirit"" is an inspiring tale that can help all of us overcome limitations and break throgh barriers."
2,Don't Blindfold,"There are times where a powerhouse celebrity couple can absolutely do well on their work together. That did work with Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown when they were together on Something In Common, but for Kelis and her husband Nas, that unfortunately doesn't seem to hit the nail on the head. Blindfold Me, the second single from Kelis' record Kelis Was Here, really isn't as interesting as some of her other songs, like Milkshake was. Although she is starting to maintain her status as a well-known singer, I think Kelis needs to try something a bit better. She is a good singer, but I hope she has better song to sing next time.Song: D"
4,Very cute,Very cute candles and perfect for our construction themed party. I did not give 5 stars because I was disappointed in the detail on these. It would've been fine if there were no painted details but instead the paint job was shoddy. Otherwise completely fine for what we needed!
2,"Poor Camera Work, Not very informative","I was hoping for something of a documentary of the origins of the melbourne shuffle. What i got was a poor camera work, poor quality compilation of a bunch of underground clubs. Very little actual dancing in the video. The first 30 minutes has basically no dancing at all. There no real information and some of the segment's of video have absolutely nothing to do with the subject shuffling. There are large pieces of video where the camera man is simply slowly walking through hallways and empty rooms of clubs. Makes no sense."
2,Died after 60 days,"Replaced the original equipment motor in my Ford Escape and after less than 3 months the new motor began to rattle and would not work on the ""high"" setting. Returns are only available for 30 days. So much for OEM quality."
5,Inspiring record of an Amazing man,"I have this book. It is a MUST-Have for anybody interested in NLP or therapy.Milton's way is simple, elegant and unintrusive.Very different from other `therapies' where you go through a gamut of emotions.It does take a lot of skill to weave the `truths' into the `stories' that he tells. A form of reframing, except it is subtle, yet goes straight to the un-conscious mind, where the false beliefs are held.It is said, `The truth shall set you free' and it is a gift to learn the process. At the very least, you can detect your own `stories' (some people call them dramas) that have plagued your life."
5,An outstanding reference book.,As an NLP Practicioner I can say that it is an excellent source of knowledge. It is an outstanding tool.
5,Loved this!,"I truly enjoyed this book, as it changed the way I viewed psychological conditions, or decisions that people make that put them in various mental states. I am fascinated by how effective Erickson is with his patients and it is truly inspiring as a health practitioner to look for patterns of behavior and approach things in a simple way, rather than a complex manner. This is a great read for all healthcare professionals, or those interested in how the mind works."
4,Great stories! Support material!,"This is a great book for those who want to read stories.Milton Erickson was perhaps one of the best hypnotists in modern times. And his work should be studed by ANYONE who wants to compeletly understand what is possible with hypnosis in therapy.Read in conjunction with the works of Richard Bandler and John Grinder, the reader should be able to deepen their understanding of hypnosis in a very useful way.John WingertThe Original and Only No BS Life Coach"
2,dissapointed,"Erickson was a great man, the father of modern hypnosis, but this book is ill conceived and not executed as well as it might."
4,Understanding Erickson's therapy,Excellent book for understanding Milton Erickson's methods of therapy and explaining his brilliance and why he has had such an impact on the psychotherapeutic community.
5,Resourcefulness of Erickson,"This is a great introduction to skill, resourcefulness and versatility of Erikcson and the possibilities of Ericksonian hypnosis.The stories are fun to read and they may also inspire solutions to problems presented by your own clients, but do remember that the essence of Ericksonian hypnosis is ""utlization"" of client's background, predispositions and preferences, rather than pick a script or a technique and use it on everyone indiscriminately.It is not only techniques which are thought through NLP and Ericksonian hypnosis today that distinguished Erickson, but his respect for uniqueness of individual and the problem he was facing. Erickson was also open to using absolutely anything that may work, no matter how outrageous it would appear. And he was infinitely creative in his approach as you'll find out from the stories in this book."
5,Good companion,The book is a nice companion to other books on therapeutic process mastered by Erickson. I like it as it has many anecdotal narrative accounts which provide clarity to Ericksonian concepts.
4,interesting read,"This book gives an insight into Milton Erickson as well as his use of stories. I'm just into the second chapter, yet ,I'm already happy I bought this book."
5,Inspiring,Milton Erickson was a very wise man. Reading these stories has inspired me on my quest of life. Thank You Milton.
3,Interesting and well made,"While the coffee maker is interesting and well made, which is why I purchased it, it's too much effort for an everyday coffee maker. In addition, the coffee tends to cool rapidly.Pro's are the coffee is smooth similar to that produced by a vacuum pot.If you're into it and the fragile glass construction doesn't put you off it's a great to play with."
2,Tastes good if you ever get a cup,"Cannot use other filters. When using the squares it seems as though an airlock occurs and the water ceases dripping. You do need a lot of time and patience. The coffee is not bitter. The package box does not have any padding in it and the one that Amazon uses is just a little bigger than it, so the first one arrived broken and the second is good. Easy clean as you just need to rinse it out after use and shouldn't have to take of the wood band for cleaning too often."
5,BACKUP,"WE BOUGHT THIS AS A BACK UP. THAT SAYS IT ALL ABOUT OUR ALLEGIANCE TO CHEMEX. WE HAVE TRIED PERK AND PRESS AND MELITA AND A DOZEN DRIP MACHINES. NOTHING COMES CLOSE. OUR CHEMEX GETS A LOT OF USE AND ABUSE, AND IT'S GOING STRONG. THIS SECOND IS JUST IN CASE, AN UNDERSTUDY."
4,In a nutshell,"I wouldn't necessarily say our Chemex 10 cup makes the best coffee I've ever tasted, but the coffee's certainly very good. We bought the Chemex to replace an 8 cup cafétière (French press) that made different, thicker but equally good coffee. Making coffee with the cafétière, though, meant that after the first pour the coffee became increasingly muddy. Our Chemex makes enough coffee at a consistent strength for the two of us to have two decent helpings each in the morning. Making the coffee in a Chemex is more effort at the beginning but far easier to clean up at the end than with a cafétière. I would recommend first rinsing the Chemex filters with hot water (and thereby also warming the Chemex glass) to get rid of as much papery taste as possible. Having a tiny galley kitchen, we like using a manual coffee maker, which doesn't clutter the countertops, together with an electric kettle and the Chemex works well without seeming too fragile."
1,Completely shattered!,This item came to me completely shattered in many peices. I was reimbursed but not offered a replacement. What a waist of time.
5,Outstanding!!,"I've always had an issue with brewing coffee at home. I just could never get a consistent brew at home, even though I would duplicate the ""recipe"".The Chemex Coffee Maker has produced consistent and perfect pots every time, not to mention the best coffee I've had. I was first introduced to Chemex at a botique coffee shop, where I had a great cup of coffee. After buying this, I can now replicate that experience at home.The only downside to this brewing system is that a full pot goes cold quicker, but even room temperature, the flavor is still perfect."
2,Doesn't work as good as it looks,"This device is lovely but its functional design does not come up to the standards of it's physical design. Long touted as the ultimate coffee maker, we decided to give it a try. It makes and incredibly clear cup of coffee. That's it strength. It's weaknesses are: The filter cone will not hold all the water neccessar to make the max capcaity of coffee the carafe is designed for; the paper filter will adhere to the glass cone and create a vaccumm that does not permit the liquid to flow through the filter thus making the brewing time in consistent; the filter will burp and splash coffee out of the cone making a mess; the coffee cools off dramatically in the coffee making process.'It is nice to compare coffee brewed in a automatic drip and this device. It has it's uses for tastings, but the design needs more work."
5,Amazing coffee!,When our old coffee maker bit the dust I bought this after reading tons of glowing reports on [...]. I was surprised when it got the most and the highest reviews of ALL the coffee makers listed. I figured I'd give it a try since it wasn't too expensive. The way I've found to make a great hot pot of coffee is to pour hot water into the carafe to get it warm while the water is boiling. Then when the whistle blows on my teakettle I pour out the water and get the filter ready and start brewing. The coffee really is delicious and not bitter. We can't figure out what makes it so good but we love it. We are never going back to automatic drip again!
5,Great piece of work,"I found out about this book through reading Milo Wolff's work. This book places some of Wolff's ideas into a rigorous mathematical framework. The last chapter of Collective Electrodynamics provides an amazing answer to a question that I've been wondering about for years - ""How and why do quantum jumps take place?"" Just for this, it was worth purchasing this book.This book and Wolff's books provide the best explanation of quantum physics that I have ever read. After reading these works, one sees that quantum physics is not mysterious and mystical at all. It is actually very reasonable."
5,Great kid book,I purchased htis book for my ten year old grandson. He absolutely loves the book! He is an avid book reader.
5,funny and smart,"I loved this book it was realy funny and the storys were smart and realy well written. I also realy liked the little elistrations on the sides ( most dont have anything to do with the storeys so be prepared) My favorite picture is the one where it says on the top right corner "" If you flip this corner your sure to get a fright"" and you flip the corner and it has a scary face that says "" BOO"" I loved this book 5 stars!"
4,"A strange book, but one that is both fun and calming","This is an unusual book.As near as I can tell, the events that we see happening in the story are the same ones that are supposed to be going on in the book the little boy and otters read. Don't think about it too hard, you'll get a headache.Instead, focus on the loving mother moon, the fun-filled otters, the clear illustrations.This book is just the perfect length, incidentally, for those ""let's rush through bedtime"" nights!"
3,informative but...,"I was really kind of disappointed with this book. I was just expecting... more. The information is ok, but it's not definitive in most senses. I mean, it's like the author THINKS what he's saying is true, but really not sure? Or more like when you hear someone telling a folk tale and it sounds real but you really know it's not. This is an OK book but not one I'd take too seriously."
2,"This is not the original, but the remixed edition","I have the original 12"" 45 of ""Magic Fly"" by Kebekelektrik. My label doesn't make any mention of this being a Tom Moulton Mix, nor was Gino Soccio listed anywhere on the credits. The June 1977 version, released in the US on the T.K. Records, was produced by Tony Green and the mix was credited to G. Cucuzzela and D. Zgarka. According to [...], Tom Moulton's remixed versions appeared one year later, released in the States on the Salsoul Records Label. (That's the version offered here.) I prefer the unadulterated, original versions, but that's my opinion -- considering the song itself was a rush-release cover of the original by a group called Space -- curiously, all versions are available at Apple's online store (except the original 12"" by Magic Fly -- the single version is included, though)."
2,Too hot. Fast cooker?,"We have had this slow cooker for seven years, and I'm throwing it out. One too many burned meals. It seems to be getting hotter with age as well. I haven't measured the temperature, but on low, frozen chicken thighs burned in less than 5 hours. Completely frozen! This might be a good idea if you want something cooked say in, 2 hours but I want a slow cooker to make my meal while I'm at work.I'm throwing this out and getting one that has a temperature I can set. I'm sick of burned meals."
1,"The ""Crock""ery Cooker","Do not buy this crock pot. It slipped from my had at a height of literally 6"" or less and the bottom busted out of the EMPTY crockpot. I'm not sure if it was the angle that the enormous 6"" epic fall hit the pot but the bottom popping our ruined the pot as there is no way to realign it. Now I'm not very rough on my cookwear, but this is ridiculous. Do not waste your money on this fragile POS...that being said, the cook temps on it were fine and the ceramic pot inside was very nice."
3,"Nice Looking Crockpot, But...","I searched high and low for a cooker that is NOT made in the People's Republic of China. I was thrilled when I found this one.Unfortunately, when it came in, we discovered that this appliance **IS** made in China. Amazon, please update your listing.I'm sure I'm not the only person concerned about the fact that everything seems to be made in China anymore. So... Any manufacturer who reads this should be aware that there are those of us who try not be buy Chinese products. Why not make it in Mexico if USA labor is too costly???"
5,Have had this crock SEVERAL years now,I cannot believe the negative reviews I've been reading on here about this crock. Granted some company produces a lemon now and then but any review that this slow cooker is junk is outrageous. I bought this one the year they started making it and still use it now. A slow cooker that doesn't actually COOK (I am speaking of temperatures too low) is the cooker worthy of a mud slinging review and it's not this crock! This honey cooks hotter on low than some crocks and thank goodness for that because most of us who are seasoned cooks know bacteria thrive in a warm/kinda hot environment! The absolute only thing I can say is worthy of a slight frown with this product is that the lid spits out a bit of moisture on the countertop now and then..geesh
1,JUNK!!!!,This is Junk! The hangers didn't line-up and had to be cutoff. So then I had to pay another muffler shop to replace it!
5,"Best polish, keeps car looking new",My husband has been using the product for 15 years now and we have a 1992 Ford Explorer that has only had Dura Shine put on it. Alot of people have commented how the Explorer don't look that old that the paint still looks allmost new. We give this polish out as gifts when someone buys a new car.
3,Ok! So You Like Illuminated Manuscripts.,"This book is good, not great. Its to small and many of the illistrations are too small,and hard to see. But for the money its worth it. They have many other books that are a bit better than this one. Here is one that is very good 'Masterpieces of the J.Paul Getty Museum Illuminated Manuscripts'. This book is awesome with easy to read text and wonderful pictures. Happy Reading."
4,An Exemplar for the keen-eyed!,"Excellent reproduction of a number of styles, with reasonable commentary. Very valuable for me as a newbie, to provide a sense of medieval style and composition. The size is at once very handy and very frustrating."
3,Illuminated Manusccipts: Treasures of the Pierpont Morgan Library New..,The book is much to small. You only can view the reproductions with a magnifying glas. The selection of titles is well done.
1,"Think Long, Think Hard before buying Porter Cable 4215 mini dovetail template","I purchased the Porter Cable 4212 dovetail jig and it works very good, though setting the depth with the supplied plastic molded screw adjustment is pretty hokey. HOWEVER, I make a large number of jewelry boxes and wanted to use the mini dovetail jig, 4215, on my Porter Cable jig. Big mistake! The 9/32 bit is very delicate and it broke after cutting about 80 gently guided cuts. The major problem came when I discovered this bit is ONLY available special order from Porter Cable! Well, I called Porter Cable and was politely told they had no bits, and would not have any for two months at least! It is absolutely incredible and unconscieceable that a company such as Porter Cable would produce a product that can only be used with bits they sell, and then not keep the bits in stock! BTW, Porter Cable is now owned by Black & Decker, which also owns Delta and DeWalt."
1,WORKS WELL,"THE TEMPLATE WORKS WELL BUT I DID HAVE THE DOVETAIL BIT BREAK AFTER THREE CUTS IN RED OAK SO BE CAREFUL WITH THIS BIT. ALSO YOU WILL NOT FIND THE 9/32"" BITS AVAILABLE ANYWHERE BUT PORTER CABLE!!!"
3,Reason To Believe,"This is a basically good movie. I was disappointed that there was not an unrated version. There are scenes which have been edited out. If you buy a censored version (which the ""R"" version is), you've been cheated. The movie should be seen as the director filmed it!"
3,Probing report on how family firms rise and fall,"Before soap operas, people could follow the rise and fall of actual famous families' fortunes. The soaps borrowed heavily from the sagas of wealthy families, stories with the essential elements of any good drama: money, nepotism, jealousy, decadence and conflict. Family businesses are the world's most popular form of corporate ownership, yet few family businesses make it past the second generation. Judy Martel offers case histories and aptly describes the problems associated with family fortunes, but tends to fall short of fully explaining solutions. She repeats some remedies often, such as forming a ""family council."" And, some remedies seem slight, such as ways to resolve differences over sharing a summer house. We appreciate Martel's emphasis on family values, while wishing this book's solutions were all as solid as the fascinating problems it describes."
4,Cowboy Swing,"Nothing short of fantastic. Harmonies are tight and sweeeeeeet, and the choice of songs on this album is perfect. Sure brings a smile to my face, and I'm certain it will for you too. Especially in the days of ""politial correctness"". The only right way is the COWBOY WAY. Very few ""gray areas"". Hard work, perseverance, determination to get the job done right, and a love of the land."
4,The best freestyles I've ever heard!,"Thanks to markjukes for selling me this cd! The sound quality isn't the best, but considering that this is a freestyle cd, it's understandable. By listening to this cd, you really get a sense of what it took for all these artists to get to the top. All the tracks are good, but my favorite would have to be from Eminem & D12. Be sure to to check out markjuke's movie when it comes out!"
2,Song quality sucks......do not buy!!!,I recently purchased Rap City: The Best of the Booth and I must say it wasn't what I expected. I expected a CD from AMAZON.com and instead I purchased this cd from a random ebay seller. The Cd looked like it was burned/copied at home. I paid for a brand new CD and it definatly was NOT brand new. This is a rip-off and I'm shocked that AMAZON.com would even sell such a bad product.
4,GOOD BOOK!,"I enjoyed this book and am VERY glad that the series is back to racing!!!! [spoiler] I really hate the books were they make Ashleigh look bad, but this isn't one of them."
3,so so,"There were several aspects of this book that annoyed me. Christina for one. I don't like how Karle Dickerson portrays her character. She's bratty and obnoxious. And she whines all the time.But, positive things. I liked the change of scenery. Now just the usual track all the time, we get to go to New Orleans! There's also some cool character interaction as there is in all of Dickerson's books. She's excellent with witty dialogue. I also liekd how the racing scenes are written.All in all, it's get's 3 stars. Not the best in the series, but I've read far worse. Having said all this, they are chosing to end the TB series. This really saddens me and I'd hate for that to happen. Please don't end the TB series!!!"
1,bodum steamer /shock & awe. buyer beware!,"look what happened to my bodum asparagus steamer! it has a triple ply bottom and side walls. after several uses i heard this loud crack and the top of the pot split apart! (i loved it til then.)buyer beware. bodum usa told me to send it back and they would send a new one. upon receipt of the pot, they informed me that they did not and could not obtain these pots anymore, and would i accept a ""store credit"" of $79.00 or, a wok. neither of which i wanted.Bodum Chef 5-Quart Tall Asparagus Steaming Pot with Lid"
5,Spiritual,"A very good CD, just purchased and found out. Sensational and to be remembered in times. Nowadays not many DJ like ATB."
4,Very Strong,"This is a good compilation. It has nice synths and some good beats. Could have more vocals and some of the songs are WAY to slow. Nice relaxation music, but for the dancefloor? Well try some Euro-Dance"
4,A feel of both worlds!,"I had read many reviews of this cd with many fixed feelings. I decided to go and buy the album with much anticipation to hear it from all these mix feelings. It has a definite new sound from Movin Melodies, but i would have to say that Two worlds brings out a good piece of ATB out. The first cd is definetly more alive in trance sounds and lets his audience see the dance floor from a different perspective. The second cd is mellow but also brings out a new side of ATB that brings out much emotions. I would definetly recommend this cd to anyone who loves trance and enjoys a bit of change to their cd library."
3,A nice compilation,"The first disc on this CD is really good. The trance rhythm flows disctintively in tracks like Fields of Love, See u again, Let u go, The summer and klangwelt. all the tracks have that ATB touch in them, the familiar sound from his earlier album. A good buy but nothing compared to the hits like 9pm(till i come) or don't stop. the second disc flows out mellow. not for a really hardcore trance fans. you have to listen to the CD's a lot of times, before you finally get it."
1,One World Too Many,"~trance so kind~ -INTERRUPT- ~feeling and movin to the groove~ -INTERRUPT- . . .Ain't exactly what you'd think of as trance music, now is it. Well, that's exactly what Tanneberger gives you in his new effort, Two Worlds. It's two worlds, alright: one listening pleasure, the other slow death by cheese. And thanks to ATB, you'll get to spend plenty of time in both with this 2-CD product.I'm giving this a 1 simply because I think 1, not 2, is what ATB needs to start thinking about. This album goes back and forth between trance and cheese so often that, at some point, you have to wonder why he is putting you through 2 CDs of this. One CD of just the good stuff would have been delicious. He could have entitled it, One World (Is Enough)."
2,A disappointment for me...,"I love ATB, but I found this CD to be repetitive and just boring. The only track worth noting is ""The Summer"", which sounds like he just took ""9 PM (Till I Come)"" and played it backwards.If you want to hear ATB at his finest, check out his Clubbers Guide To Trance from Ministry of Sound. I think that could very possibly be the best trance album to date. It's definately worth the steep import cost.TheMike"
2,It's nothing special . . .,"Andre Andre Andre - what are you doing? In my opinion - if you're going to put out a double cd - make sure there are enough decent tracks on it. 75% of the songs on ""Two Worlds"" are ""filler"" tracks - or ""noise"" to keep the CD going. I actually won this CD online - autographed by ATB himself - and not even that was enough for me to keep it. Mediocre dance and chillout tunes is what this album is all about. Purchase ""Movin Melodies"" if you want to see the Half-decent side to ATB. Standout tracks:""The Summer "",""The Fields Of Love (with York)"",""Let U Go (with The Wild Strawberries)"" and ""klangwelt"". Pass on this one, folks."
1,Techno Pop Crap,I had the misfortune of purchasing this CD. The reasons I don't like it are: It is entirely too simple. By that I mean its a beat and a melody. He may be a good DJ but his original music is left far behind. His overuse on the pitch modulation on the bass loops were driving me insane. Overall I just didn't like it at all. I listen to electronica all the time and I just couldn't feel this album at all.
1,Could buy because it was discontinued. Would like to.,"I would love to buy this product. Again, this would make a great gift. You put me down for 20 if they were available.I have bought them at other placed but not in this color or cover.Thank you in advance."
5,Yezzzzzzzzzz,I just love Garfield and this cookie jar was soooo perfect in my kitchen. I'll tresure it forever.
3,Slightly lacking in techniques,"While I liked the sections of how this particular ryu came about, I'd wished that there were more emphasis on the techniques and their execution. Nevertheless, it was a pretty interesting read and a good reference book."
2,Don't waste time or money,"Only 25 minutes of this is the Surrender at Appatomattox. The rest is random advertisement for other projects by whoever created this. The 25 minutes is mostly music and still photos. Only about 10 minutes is worth watching... the converstaion between General Lee and General Grant, and even that has poor sound quality and acting. If you want to learn about this historical event, go somewhere else to do so."
4,6oz cup NOT an 8oz mug.,This mug has the capacity of a 6oz teacup rather than the standard US 8oz size mug. It took boiling hot beverages with no problem unlike some other brands that cracked when the intended hot beverages went in.This mug is made of finer thinner glass. It is not a chunky Anchor Hocking type glass mug.
4,"Bormioli Rocco H Drink Emotion Mugs, Set of 2, Gift Boxed",Absolutely Great....Exactly what I wanted.Arrived in a timely manner and if I ever need more I would not hesitate to order again.
3,Smaller Than Expected,"I bought these expecting them to be standard size, but instead, they were very petite things that require about two cups to get an adequate amount of tea."
1,Unreasonably delicate!,"I was surprised by how thin these glasses are, and also by the thinness of the handle (which makes it difficult to hold when full). They seem very delicate. Also, there's a bubble in one glass and a bump in the other (defects from poor manufacturing quality). I will keep them b/c they are cheap enough for borosilicate glass (Pyrex).Update: Ive only used these for a very short time and b/c they are so thin I've been extremely careful in handling them. In spite of that, while washing one of them out, I just barely tapped it on the faucet and the bottom cracked. For this reason, I'm changing my rating from 3 stars to 1 star."
5,Just want I wanted,I was very suprised this arrived in the mail a lot sooner than expected. I was happy with the qualitiy - since it was being used for photograph - I wanted to make sure it didn't look cheap. I was very happy. I would buy from this seller again! :)
1,low quality,These spiderwebs were torn up when I got them. It was impossible to stretch the out to hang anywhere. I cannot recommend this item.
3,Tiny package!,"These are tiny packages! The quality might be good as other reviewers have indicated (I haven't used them yet), but I was so surprised at how small the packages were. Albertsons even sells packages that are 5 times bigger (or more) for only a dollar something, which I found out after I already ordered these."
3,came in time for the halloween party and was cheap,what else can i say about these creepy crawlies other than i love to stick em in my husbands bed and totally freak him out. he hates spiders and squeals like a little girl! so mean but soooo funny
4,Bad news for Jane Austen fans,Jane Austen is pretty surely damaged by this comparison : much as English novels are by comparison with French.It would appear that Charlotte Bront exceeds Jane Austen both in ability and sensibilities even from an early age.The comparison of style in not in Austen's favor.Charlotte's poetry is as superior as her imaginationand characterizations.She makes Austen's results appear more comical than realistic: cut out characterizations.The emotional and lyrical expression of Bront themes show a great depth of feelingand understanding of human nature lacking in Austen.
4,Good strings for the price,"I'm a newbie at guitar, but I knew that the one I purchased would need different strings. I headed for ones with decent reviews and got exactly what I was looking for: soft, decent strings that were easy to put on and aren't immediately rusting. I would highly recommend these for newbies like myself who are looking for fairly inexpensive strings as replacements."
2,Wrong weight,"I ordered extra light gauge strings, but received standard gauge. Oops! Otherwise, they're fine-- brand new, in sealed packaging. Fast shipping, too-- just wrong item!"
3,good,Ink arrived on time and is what I ordered. However the cartredge is refurbished. It still works well and I do recomend this cartidge. Worth buying from this seller. Not quite the quality I was seeking. But for the price..a great buy.
3,Good read,It would be best if this book is read before you hire someone. It will put you in the right mindset right out of the gate. It will get you on track if you pick it up after hiring someone.
5,Not at beginner's or intermediate dance dvd,"I have been dancing, pretty much my whole life and don't have two left feet by any stretch of the imagination, but this dvd is not for beginners or intermediate it is for the advanced. I have only used it once, I just got it today and am impressed that I will take some time to become an expert at it, so it will keep me challenged. I usually lose interest very quickly because I'm able to master the steps rather quickly that won't be the case here. Although, I like the dvd it did not do a good job of showing or breaking down the steps before heading straight into the routine. If you take some time to learn new dance routines, this dvd will leave you frustrated although even while only attempting to do the moves it gives you a very good workout."
3,Transitions too fast,"I grew up dancing, but found this DVD very hard to follow - especially the Club dance section. I have found that I've needed to watch the Latin and Jive sections a few times to figure out the moves. Also, the transitions are very fast, and I found the sections to be repetitive. I'm still using them, but I think I will try out another video."
4,Targeted Workout,I recently purchased several Firm DVDs and this is one of my favorites. I love that it really does target the lower body and that it doesn't involve some of the tricker moves that the others do. (for those of us who are have coordination challenges). Kelsie is very motivating and does a great job. I think it could have been a little longer though - I like the 40-45 minute workouts.
4,"Fast pace, intense on the legs","This is a very intense workout for the legs. There is pretty much no upper body workout in this one. It is fast pace, and at times felt like Tae Bo. There short bursts of cardio mixed in with strength training moves. The cardio bursts are shorter than the cardio segments in other Firm videos. I will be doing this video pretty often."
2,TOO HARD TO KEEP UP!,WHEN I PURCHASED THE VIDEO I FIGURED IT WOULD BE A FUN WAY TO EXERCISE SINCE IT INCORPORATED DANCE MOVES INTO THE WORKOUT...UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS JUST TOO HARD FOR ME TO KEEP UP WITH THE MOVES...I SPENT MORE TIME TRYING TO LEARN THE MOVES THAN ACTUALLY EXERCISING.
3,"Fun, but not high intensity","I bought this video to do with my roommate, neither of us are dancers, and it took us a couple times before we could learn the dances. Once we got the moves down, it was a fun workout, but it's not a high calorie burning, sweat inducing workout. If you're looking for low to medium intensity, this is perfect."
4,Great workout that is lots of fun,"No, this video is not taught in a beginner style, where it breaks down things very slowly, and adds on slowly. However, as many have suggested, if you focus on learning one section at a time, one move at a time, you can get it. I focused on one section, and even at times broke it down to doing just the legs, then just the arms, then putting the two together. As you might have guessed, there was a lot of rewinding involved. However, it wasn't long before I got all the sections down, and I find doing the whole routine is a lot of fun, gives me a good work out and is a nice alternative to the weight-based workouts more typical of The Firm. Allison is very encouraging, with a fun attitude, and makes me want to do the routine that much better on each go round.For those of you who are frustrated, consider giving it another try, while breaking it down a bit at a time. You will get it, and when you do, this will become one of your favorites -- it is for me!"
4,A good workout for the legs,"This DVD consists of isolated leg workouts (with or without light weights- no Transfirmer step needed) and cardio sessions.Each leg is equally worked out and the movements are not hard, but the cueing isnt the best so one may need to watch the movements before performing. I'm not a supporter of very fast movements (explosive perhaps) that ask the workout person to hop and perform knee movements since that is such a tender area. So use caution until you get used to the overall movement/concepts.These are unique movements/exercises that I havent seen elsewhere. I like this more for the time concentration and I feel that I get a decent workout in the 30-min than I might do on my own.Realize that this DVD is both leg exercises combined with cardio."
4,Great short workout,"I wanted a workout that was effective and time efficeint and this is it. As a single mom, short on time, can't reach the gym and loves to exercise, this is the workout for me when i don't have the time to train for an hour and racing to get to work. The combinations are effective and i am seeing results on my legs when i want to target train my legs once a week in combination with my other workouts."
2,"Should be named ""Cardio Dance Confusion""","I have rhythm, coordination, and have been considered a pretty good dancer. So, why do I have 2 left feet with this video? Alison goes way too fast, and moves on to the next before you can get your bearing on the current. Very frustrating."
3,"Too difficult for me, but a good DVD.","Tried this exercise video, but it's a little too fast for me. I love to dance, but I found it difficult for me to follow. Looks like it would be a great workout for someone younger than 52."
5,Great workout...great fun!,"I just did my first workout with this dvd and I LOVED it! Alison is a favorite instructor of mine, I have two of her other dvds and they are the best as far as the Firm goes in my opinion. The music was even pretty good (which is a stretch for me to admit). I worked up a sweat trying to keep up with the dance moves, I'm sure I'll get them down after doing this one a few more times. Nonetheless, a great, fun workout!"
4,Fun new addition to the Firm videos,"I LOVE this workout. I am old Firm Believer and some of the newer releases have been very disappointing. Cardio Dance Fusion is very fast paced, excellently cued, and just a plain fun workout. Alison does a great job of getting you through the steps at tempo so after a playing or two, you have most of the moves down. I'm not a dancer nor am I terribly graceful, however by the third playing, I had the steps all down pretty well. At least well enough to really enjoy the dances. I have RA so I was concerned about my joints but no worries with this workout. Just plently of fun, sweat and calorie burning. I actually want to work out with this one! Don't let the express workout option fool you. They may be shorter, but you'll still have the heart rate way up there! If you're looking for an excuse to do cardio more often, this is it :-)"
1,"Not for beginners, much too fast","I am a beginner and I thought this video would be OK. I want to lose about 15 pounds. I was shocked to see that the instructor immediately jumped right into complicated footwork! No warm-up (stretching like you should to prevent injury), no breaking down the steps or going slowly! Only for very advanced dancers. Much, much too fast. Also, she wears black pants and black shoes so it is very difficult to see the way her feet are moving. White shoes would have made it much easier. I give this product ZERO stars."
2,"This is not a ""killer"" workout","If you are VERY fit, this is a decent video for a rest-day type of workout. I am serious into fitness. I enjoy doing videos on my rest day. I read the reviews and was hoping for much more. I am writing this review in case others like me look into this video. With all due respect to other reviewers, if you are hard-core, this video is not difficult."
2,"A little difficult, not much of a workout","I was really excited when i read the reviews. I always thought that these dancy type workouts never really gave you a workout. But i decided to purchase this DVD anyways since everyone gave such good marks. Unfortunately my original instinct was right. The difficult steps didn't really bother me because i was able to pick them up after a couple of times, but i just didn't feel like i got this great workout when i was done. I didn't really sweat or get my heart rate up much. It's too bad, because i really like Allison and her DVD's."
1,This dvd sucked,DVD SUCKED.. didn't like it..it was too fast pace and didn't feel anything after working out. There should be an instructional section to show some of the moves.
1,I did not like this DVD,I was very disappointed in this DVD. I feel like I wasted the precious 45 minutes I had set aside to really get a great workout. Most of the exercises had 8 counts total. That's barely enough to get proper form or allow a few seconds to follow the tape. I did not find it challenging. I have used other Firm tapes over the years and found this one did not measure up. I don't even recommend it for beginners because it switched too quickly to follow. I give it a thumbs down.
3,tough first time,this is a video that definitely requires some form of coordination and base level fitness. the moves are quite difficult to follow and move quickly from one to another leaving you in the dust if you haven't gotten it the first time. i would recommend this for people who are used to aerobics dvds in general and are fairly fit and want to shape up as opposed to someone really starting out.
4,Super Fun!,This is a really fun workout. The time went by so fast because I was having fun. I watched the DVD before I actually did it which is recommended because she cues fast and you can't always see her feet right away. The only thing I disliked about this workout is it was a little difficult to do some moves on carpet. Other than that I worked up a sweat and had fun!
3,"Good, once you get used to the whirlwind routine!","The instructor spends NO time teaching you the routine, so starting this workout is like walking into an aerobics class for the first time mid-way, and trying to keep up! It's quick-paced and effective, but one can logically expect more instruction from an instructor!"
1,"Buggy, I returned it, don't waste your time","This showed up, I got the IP address changed on it, then configured the syslog options. The switch locked up and never came back. Power up reset options appear to be limited to uploading a factory default config file you can't download off the web site via XMODEM. This thing is a turkey, don't waste your time."
4,Doesn't look like much in the picture...,"But it's great! I used to keep all of my daughter's bowls, cups, lids and spoons all jumbled together in a plastic box. Now I just spin the organizer to the bowl or cup I want! Very neat and doesn't take up too much room. I would give it 5 stars if the center area that stores the utencils was a bit deeper."
3,Overpriced for what you get,"THe box is half empty space (to make it look bigger? to make you think you are getting some cups/bowls with it?) It's like $2 worth of cheap plasitc. BUT if you need to organize your stuff, its ok. Just way overpriced."
2,Cheezy Charger,"I bought this charger to charge my iPhone from my car's cigarette lighter.I'm not satisified with this product.1. The charger produces static on my FM radio when the phone is plugged it.2. The charger charges my iPhone very slowly. (Its hardly rapid.)3. The charger's iPhone plug adapter is a separate part from the charger. (The charger is 'universal'.) The adapter needs to be fiddled with to make a good connection between the charger's phone-side cable and the iPhone. (I suspect this adapter connection is the source of the static.)In summary, the charger is of lower quality and construction then the iPhone. It is however usable."
5,WIRE BEAD TIRE,Tires came promptly and will serve the purpose of a occasional use tire. the price was very reasonable
4,Decent Tire for Money,"These tires are a good buy if you want commuter tires. They stay on the rim, and seem to hold the road. They do seem to wear a bit quickly and are a bit heavy, but I'm not racing with them any time soon."
5,Great Tires,Ride wonderful and are sturdy. They've taken quite a beating. Not to mention they're aesthetically pleasing. I would definitely purchase again.
2,Be careful inflating,"I bought 2 tires 2 weeks ago, it is ok if you put 75 psi, DO NOT PUT 90 psi, the tires will come off the rim and bust the tubes inside, I inflated to 90 psi, it didn't came off right away, after about an hour later when I came bake to ride the bike then I found out that tires came off the rim and 2 of my new tubes are busted."
3,Can't beat the price.,I purchased these tires for an old touring bike that I use on an indoor trainer I use in the winter. They function fine and appear to be decently made.
5,Awesome results!,"Cellex is the original Vitamin C line, and I heard about them years ago when they developed a strawberry anti-aging cream, though I never tried it. I really like serums rather than creams, because my skin is oily as well as showing signs of ""life"". I bought this kit just to see what it would do vs skinceuticals C serums, which I have used for a couple of years. OMG. The difference is like night and day. My skin took off in the most wonderful direction, it is already more firm, my pores are smaller, and the lines beside my mouth are going away. I am impressed, and will continue to buy this. It is actually doing what it says it will do, and that's all I ask."
4,A good investment,"I am a sixty-four year old woman and have been using Cellex-C on and off for several years. I am again returning to Cellex-C because it works really well for me. The change in my skin smoothness and brightness is apparent in a relatively short time. My skin has a glow that even my husband has noticed. I guess I'll be staying with this product for a long time. I'm through trying other ""amazing products""! This is my amazing product."
2,Li-Ion or Ni-MH??,"Well, straight away you know something is odd: the picture clearly says Li-Ion, but the Tech Details says Nickel-Metal Hydride. Which is it? Would you buy a battery from a company that can't get this basic but important fact straight?"
4,Commander Cuddles,"In spite of being a not-too-friendly droid guy, General Grievous is actually kind of cute in this cartoonish action figure.This Grievous is pretty impressive. The details on him are a bit simple, but work very well. He has absoloutly no trouble standing up (due to his massive feet).Grievous's action feature is a four arm lightsaber attack. Squeeze his legs, and he raises all of his arms, making him look rather intimidating. He has four lightsabers (2 green and 2 blue) that can be put in his hands seperatly, or they can be connected to make 2 double bladed sabers.He also comes with a grappling hook (why is it always a grappling hook?). I don't use it, but it seems to fire pretty well, and Grievious grips it fairly well.Overall, this is a pretty good Grievous figure thats suitible for younger kids, because this fearsome droid general is actually kind of cute."
5,Great Camping Table,"This table is so easy to assemble and is very lightweight for travel. We go airplane camping in a Piper Super Cub so lightweight, compact and sturdy is a must for us. It comes in a handy travel bag. It's a great table at a great price."
3,Good for the money,"The bottom of the bag completely tore open on 1st use, but table was as described. Legs don't individually adjust for uneven ground, but the table assembles quickly and is decently sturdy and lightweight. Great for a camp grill and preparing food."
4,More Than I Bargained For,"As a Texan, I'm well-aware that one never should allow the truth to get in the way of a good story. Eckhardt's volume is an enjoyable mixture of truth and myth. To his credit, he dutifully engages to denote both of them whenever possible.I purchased the book seeking further inspiration for songwriting material and I wasn't disappointed. About the only deficiency I could find was that the author had absolutely no coverage of the Donkey Faced Woman who lives in the hills Northeast of San Antonio."
5,Well Done,"This is a well-written Regency with strong characters and a cohesive plot. The characters are likeable and believable, and the story proceeds at a very rapid pace. The author injects humor and danger in equal parts, and her use of music is woven wonderfully into the book.This author is able to do in a relatively short novel what many authors cannot in ones twice as long, i.e., engage the reader in a satisfying read from start to finish."
4,Nicely Done,This was an engaging story with interesting characters. An exciting adventure to go with the romance.
4,"Now That I'm Found, I Miss Being Lost","Nothing groundbreaking on album number 5, and that's a beautiful thing, because if it's one thing we rely upon with Eef, it's his absolute sincerity, deadpan surrealism and steadfast belief. The dichotomy of Brooklyn and Nashville, where he was rooted and sojourned to, trickles in and out of his lyrics, as does loss [he lost his mother this past year, as did his wife], confusion, awareness, and inevitably, love. It's a rock n' stroll by the deftest songwriter since Randy Newman. Words to live by: `Now that I'm found I miss being lost'. My grade: A-"
1,Think twice,"I bought 2 sets and some separate pieces, one set was ok, the second had two broken pieces: a cup and an 11.5 inch dinner plate, as I had acquired some separate pieces I decided not to return the box, besides I liked the design. After two weeks of using the sets, one dinner plate showed a discoloration and two salad plates broke in the microwave oven, I have decided to return one of the sets, I really question Pfaltzgraff quality, would it be the reason why they sell this tableware at such discounts? Really dissapointed"
2,pfaltsgraff providence dishes,"These dishes are pretty to look at, but after a few uses my flatware makes marks on them. It looks like a child has taken a lead pencil and scribbled all over the plates. My flatware has never left marks on any of my other dishes. You can get the marks off by using a cleaning product called the Bar Keepers Friend, but who wants to spend time scrubbing marks off your dishes a couple of times a week."
1,Homophobic Rant,"Laughton was one of the most respected screen actors of the 20th century. it's a shame that such an artistic giant has received such limited literary exploration, which makes this biased piece of claptrap even worse. Callow''s stalewart British bigotry is all over this superficial storytelling of Laughton, a closeted gay man who was, as many closeted gay men are, emotionally tortured. Aside from the author's patronizing and sanctimonious jabs at the subject, it's quite clear the hypocrite Callow would have never written the book had Laughton NOT been gay."
2,Nice camera; forget about tech support.,"This camera works well under almost all conditions and is well worth the price for that; having said that, one can only hope that one never needs a new battery or tech support from Vivitar. As far as I can tell, neither exists. The battery stopped taking a full charge after about 6 months of normal use, it's not available at the Vivitar website or through any OEM battery suppliers and numerous queries to the supposed Tech Support area of Vivitar have elicited no response. I would recommend you look elsewhere for a digital camera."
2,Not so pleased,"I bought the camera becasue I loved it's features, price, and ease of controls. However, after six months of ownership those benefits are worthless considering the fact that it can't focus reliably. Only half of my photos are in focus. It doesn't matter if I use a tripod and timer to avoid blurr, and forget action shots. I wouldn't travel with it cause I can't afford to not be able to trust my camera. I wish Vivitar would come out with a software upgrade fix."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this camera about a year ago and used it 4 times. It won't focus, nor will the battery hold a charge. I emailed customer service and didn't receive a reply. $200.00 down the drain. Now I have to buy another camera. Don't waste your money."
3,Too slow,"This camera looks amazing... the many megapixels for the price, the rechargable battery, but the truth is that this camera is slow. There is no such thing as spontaneous portraits with this. It is ""ask subject to pose"" with this one. A pre-flash sometimes ruins a shot by tricking subjects into thinking the shot has already been taken.Also, the large LCD monitor uses a lot of battery power. Unfortunately, I had to decide when to take photos instead of being free to leave my camera on during an event."
3,ehhh...,"The camera is heavier than I'd expected which is a bit of a nuisance. The first time I was able to upload the pictures without a problem but the second time I got errors and they were all erased from my memory card. (Uploading has been fine since then but I don't feel like this camera is reliable anymore.) I also had the LCD screen freeze on me a few times. Considering that I've only had the camera for a few weeks, this is very disappointing. The pictures tend to come out blurry unless I hold the camera very still. I know the shutter speed is adjustable but I can't seem to find a setting where it takes a quick picture and comes out clear and even the quicker shutter speeds seem too slow. All in all, I'm not too happy with it."
2,Same problem as previous reviewer,"I agree with the reviewer who wrote somthing similar to this:It can't focus reliably. Only half of my photos are in focus. It doesn't matter if I use a tripod and timer to avoid blurr, and forget action shots. I wouldn't travel with it cause I can't afford to not be able to trust my camera. I wish Vivitar would come out with a software upgrade fix.I had Vivitar replace the camera with no improvement. Don't waste your money!"
1,worst camera ever,This is the worst camera I have ever owned. We have 2 small kids and you can never take a spontaneous picture with this camera. Very slow. And the LCD screen freezes for no reason. Extremely disappointed. Missed out on what would have been many good pictures of the children. Looking to buy a new camera after trying to cope with this lousy thing for the past year.
2,Not for me,"If you are sensitive to smells this is not for you! While it does have a plesant fragrance it is strong, perhaps to help cover the tanning lotion smell. Either way, not for those who don't like strong smelling lotion."
4,"New Frontier, Book 4: End Game","This book nicely ties up the loose ends from the previous three; as I've said before, the first four books of this series should really have been made one large book; in fact, they've been collected into an omnibus edition, and that edition I would rate at five stars. The storyline for the first four books combined is a fine one, the characters are handled quite well, and the writing style maintains Peter David's usual high quality, especially his ability to tell a dramatic story without losing his sense of humor.Still, this book on its own is only a story fragment; it has an ending, with just a couple of ongoing subplots (which is perfectly fine) but no beginning. And no story fragment is worth five stars. This is unquestionably the best ""book"" of the four, however."
4,Entertaining continuation of the opening story,"The first four books of the New Frontier series introduce an interesting array of character who make up the crew of the Excalibur, build up the back story of its ""Kirk-like"" Captain, and describe the details and fate of the Thallonian Empire. The series has breadth and depth of scope, meaty characters and plots, and large dollops of Peter David's brand of humor. I don't know if his humor will be to everyone's taste, as it has moments of silliness, but he occasionally make me laugh out loud ... rare for me when reading a book.End Game finishes off the intro of the series, but the stories go on for MANY books after this. You'll come to regard the crew of the Excalibur with as much affection as you felt for any of the crews of the TV series. Deservedly so, since its an interesting and likable assortment of personalities and skill sets.It is Star Trek as space opera at its best. Highly recommended."
4,Compelling but brooding,"I expected a rom-com from a young Janeane. Instead, the film's plot is a dark, brooding comedy (I'm not sure one should call it a comedy).I thought Janeane's performance in ""The Matchmaker"" was her magnum opus, but now I am not sure. She gives an intense, capitvating performance in this film.It should be considered must-see for Garofalo fans."
1,Junk,"I bought these knives because I didn't want to spend a lot; now I wish I would have spent more. The knives cut pretty well but sometimes slip when cutting chicken with them. Within a few days of buy them and running them through the dishwasher, they became rusted. I did call of Farberware and they told me they would replace them if I sent the set back to them. How am I going to cook without any knives. I never did send them back and I didn't get new knives yet but don't buy these, you will regret it."
1,Potentially dangerous knife set,"I purchased these knives several years ago, and immediately noticed rust spots on the blades after a few runs in the dishwasher. The plastic utensils worked wonderfully until a week ago, when i accidently left one of the spoons in a pot of boiling water. technically, it's still a spoon, but it's tough to tell by looking at it.i also found out the hard way that those rust spots aren't just on the surface, they eat through the blade, as i had one snap in half on me while slicing a potato two nights ago...not the handle, but the actual blade. had any of my fingers been in different positions, i wouldn't be able to type this review."
3,Average set for the price,"The plastic spoon melted when I washed it in the dishwasher. I would suggest washing these by hand because they are very light and tend to ""fly around"" in the dishwasher.The knives are a great item for the price.The carousel is very convient to keep all the knives and utensils in one place."
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money, buy a good set. The price should have been a clue. These cut absolutly nothing. The only thing worthwhile are the spoons and such. I wish I had seen the reviews on Amazon first! I don't have a dishwasher so I would imagine if I did, they would have rusted like everyone else's."
1,Cheap junk,"This set claims to be completely dishwasher safe, but the knives started showing rust spots the first time I washed them. The large spoons melted and warped stirring boiling water and the stand's straight up slots make a great place for dust to gather thats impossible to clean."
2,"A nice idea, but pretty much junk...","I knew when I bought this set for its very low price that it wouldn't be the highest quality set, but c'mon!I used one of the large plastic spoons in a spaghetti sauce one night, and it partially melted (well, I suppose ""became quite deformed"" is a more appropriate choice of words).The description says the knives are dishwasher safe. Hmmm, okay, but you better stock up on CLR, as these guys rust. Quickly. I think on the second pass through my dishwasher, several of the knives rusted quite badly. And the blades are rather uncomfortably thin. They don't really inspire confidence.I ended up tossing most of the knives, but I kept the plastic utensils (even the deformed spoon - it still works) and the shears (they are pretty good).Again, for the price, I wasn't surprised ..."
3,Good But The Carrusell Doesn't Work,"It is great, has everything I need, I love the scissors but the carrusel does't work and drives me crazy!"
2,Revolving Counter Top Carousel,"This was a good idea but the carousel doesn't turn easily and needs to be improved. The one I received actually had a problem and something was scraping, like plastic on plastic I guess; think it may have been seated too low on the base."
2,SMELLS GREAT,"IT SMELLS GREAT, BUT IT DOES'T STAY WITH YOU VERY LONG. I WAS HOPING IT WOULD HAVE MORE MOISTURIZER IN IT. I WISH I COULD FIND MORE SCENTS IN THIS. IT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH LATHER EITHER."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting much more after reading the raving reviews this book received. Byers is a very descriptive writer and vividly portrays his characters well, but I found some of them quite unlikable. I didn't find any resilence in his characters. Wise, gentle and necessary? I don't agree."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I've tried to read the stories in Byers' collection, but only finished 1 or 2 of them. The stories are boring, and sometimes plagued by very stereotypical characters. Even worse, Byers often drifts into worlds he clearly knows little about, resulting in rather unrealistic characters and behaviors. If you want to read some great short stories by a young writer, check out Amanda Davis' first collection, ""Circling the Drain."" Davis' stories, unlike Byers', are interesting, lyrical, and frighteningly realistic."
5,"Wonderful book, wonderful teacher","I bought this collection because Michael Byers was teaching my writing workshop at Oberlin College and I thought I should read his work while he was reading mine. Though I already had great respect for him as a teacher, I now have great respect for him as a writer. The prose is beautifully crafted and his characters are real and engaging. It's a cathartic read and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks the art of the sentence is dead."
4,Lives on the mend,"""This I know: our lives in these towns are slowly improving"": so begins Michael Byers's book of stories of seaside middle-class folk traveling and exploring their way through their misty days. The improvement is indeed slow, as characters feel their way to a deeper relationship to life, to people, to passion. Byers replicates authentic experience with a skilled eye for detail. Each story presents a captivating drama of human emotion that never delves into melodrama. So many short stories claim to explore ""the ordinary"" but wind up mired in the mundane, the bland, the mediocre; Byers's stories are richer, yet always approachable. An interesting collection of stories that provoke thought and reflection upon completion."
5,A must-read new author,"I have read an advance copy of this book, and I cannot find enough superlatives to describe it. Byers employs an understatement that is both simple and profound. His hands-off storytelling puts the reader in the middle of the emotional and psychological dramas that he creates. His characters are real, and we feel their thoughts as if they were our own.Byers' star is undoubtedly on the rise. This debut is only the beginning of a long and promising writing career."
1,Did NOT work for my reusable straw as described.,"I put it in my straw and then tried to pull it out the end of the brush came off inside the straw, right in the middle, and I couldn't get it out, so it ruined the straw and cap that was attached to it."
4,Too large for reusable straws,"I bought this for cleaning plastic reusable straws. My straws are pretty large as straws go so I thought it would fit, but no such luck. However, the quality of the brush looks very good and the little rubber tip is removable for tighter fits. I'm sure I'll find a use for it, but it doesn't work for my intended purpose."
1,bad discription.,This brush is way too big for an acrylic straw. the description is misleading. Unable to use for what I bought it for. Waste of money for me.
5,Perfect Straw Brush,We were looking for a brush to clean the straws that comes with the double walled glasses and this brush fits the bill! Highly recommend.
3,Not for plastic straws,Do not purchase if you want to use this brush to clean the plastic straws that comes with the hot/cold cups. Brush only goes in about an inch just as a prvious reviewer stated.
3,THE HANDLE CAME OFF THE FIRST TIME I USED IT!!!,"THE BRUSH IS OKAY, BUT THE HANDLE CAME OFF THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. THAT STINKS!!!!!!!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY FRIENDS."
4,Ah... the Pleasure and Regrets,"This, a very large book with very large photographs and very large typeface, contains a lot of fascinating information on the real Proust and his world. Of course, it is out of print, but the Sydney city library has one copy... Anyway, for a look at the real Marcel, not the Marcel of the recherche, this is a very lovely book to read, which is best suited to your coffee table. Check it out if you want to see who inspired which of Proust's characters."
1,mis-leading,these 14.4 volt Makita batteries did not fit my Makita 14.4 volt drill nor my Makita 14.4 volt charger. I threw them out and bought a 18 volt Dewalt! No one should ever buy Makita junk ever.
2,Flatlander,"Makita 194157-8 1434 14.4-Volt 2.6 Amp Hour NiMH Pod Style Battery, 2 PackI purchased the makita 14.4 impact driver kit with two batteries 3years ago. With only modest intermittment use, one of the batteries failed. In May 2008 I purchased the two pack. Again after only moderate use one of the new batteries failed. I like the power and performance of the unit and the batteries(when they are working) but was very disappointed in the battery life on 2 of the 4 batteries. But rather than buy new equipment, I am buying another 2 pack from Amazon as their price and service is very good."
4,"CHOOSING BRAND NAME, THIS IS MY CHOICE","FIRST, IT PERFORMED WELL. ONCE FULLY CHARGED IT LASTED LONGER THAN I EXPECTED, AND AFTER TWO WEEKS OF NOT USING IT, IT DRAINED ALMOST NONE.SECOND THE PRICE, IS UNBELIEVABLY CHEAPER IN A TWO PACK. SOME CHARGED ALMOST THE SAME PRICE FOR A SINGLE BATTERY THAN AMAZON FOR TWO PACK. IN ALL I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT"
5,best buy for Makita drill batteries,after looking around on the internet and localy I could not find a replacement battery for my drill for less than $69.00 this is a realy good deal not to be passed by
3,"Don't buy it, unless you need the ground jack","If you're looking for just an outlet tester, there are plenty that are much less expensive than this. If you need a reliable way to ground a portable ESD mat, then this may be just what you need. It does fill that function, which is why I bought it. But it's still not cheap, considering how simple it is."
4,¡¡ES HORA DE BAILAR!!,"This is a great dance mix with flavors of Miami! Has some merengue, salsa, dance, latino-hip-hop etc etc...I listened to this the other day..puts me back in noventa y siete, just add some ron, lights, and a lof of people..and its a great blast from the recent past of Latino music just before it was corrupted by Ricky et al."
3,"Charming if Dated, Marred by Introduction","Massey's book was a pioneering effort in its time, and we should all be thankful for that. At least it is a welcome point of departure. But the introduction by Jean Berlin is lacking much in the way of insight or understanding. A more experienced scholar might have presented a richer analysis."
4,68 tall buildings in photos and tech. drawings on glossy paper,"68 mostly built projects are depicted in this sizable survey mostly by excellent, large photos, but also by renderings, plans, models, sketches, site plans, details, sections, hard line presentation drawings, etc., but not more tech. drawings than one or two small ones per project. Interestingly, the SEG Apartment Tower presented on pp. 88-89 has a design of its one side found latter in all four sides of the Freedom Tower by David Childs."
3,Meh...,"Although it was delivered fairly quickly, the ring was not exactly as pictured on the product page. There is less detailing where the band meets the stone, and the stone itself is pretty empty of the normal... ""debris"" most amber has. The stone itself also feels like plastic, rather than stone. In other words, it seems to be a fake. However, it still looks nice, and I suppose ""you get what you pay for."""
4,obi wan in cartoon form,I got this figure just today. heres the story I went to walmart in hopes of getting general greivous instead I picked up this little beuty what you have heere is kenobi with the body type of theoden you will know what I mean if you read the reviw on the theoden figure. his lightsabre dosent go as tight as most figures do. he has a stern look and also comes with gear.the rest you figure out.
3,"Informative, specific, but ultimately not what I was looking for","I think this a good book for someone ready to start digging now to create their Japanese garden, someone who knows exactly what they want to do. The beginning of the book was interesting, and provided good information about and reasons for the different elements of a Japanese garden - such as water, stone lanterns, bridges, and plantings.I was hoping for a little more inspiration through photographs and seeing more examples of gardens people have created. This book gets down to the step-by-step details of building fences and dry riverbeds for example.The book does have a nice materials/plant/planting guide in the back which I took a few notes from. But I'm in a brainstorming phase with my garden not the brass tacks phase, so I did return the book and will look into a book that is more photography-based and example-based, than how-to."
3,"Wonderful charts and how-to, few photos and inspiration","I'm a landscape designer with about six Japanese Gardening books. I keep this one because it has a lot of charts, graphs, and illustrative pictures showing how to use the concepts most books just vaguely allude to. For example, how to arrange rocks seems like a simple concept till you try to do it; then it is frustrating how vague the other books are. This book has pages of actual charts of HOW to put the co0ncepts into practice.The one big quibble with the book - very few photos, so if you're looking for inspiration, you're out of luck. Also, the photos used are a bit dated and show a lot of things that people try to veer away from today, like the ""necklace of rocks"" around a pond for example. A lot of 70's style design here.This is a valuable book, but should not be your only book. Try Serene Gardens to start with."
2,Really dissapointing,I thought this would be more thorough. All it really is....a coffee table book.Pretty though.
3,Not enough how-to,"This book is meant to help inspire people build Japanese landscapes. It is very light on the how-to. I wanted a how-to book when I bought it. Lots of nice pictures, but not enough hands-on info."
3,Feller still throwing heat,"Bob Feller, one of the premier pitchers in the history of baseball, has never been one to sugarcoat his opinions. He is old-school: the good old days were the best. Today's players (and young people in general) don't appreciate how good they have it, or the sacrifices made by previous generations.Such is the essence of his ""Little Black Book of Baseball Wisdom,"" in which he opines on the trouble with today's kids (too much TV, not enough physical exertion, among other complaints). The wisdom does not come in the form of advice, but rather what he has learned as a baseball legend.Feller also writes about several of his contemporaries. To read his comments, one would think him a Will Rogers in knickers; he never met a player during his career that he didn't think was a ""great"" guy.""Little Black Book"" IS refreshing, however, given the concentration on the current game, with its quest to entertain its fans with more than just the game on the field."
3,Bob Feller's Little Black Book,"I purchased this book soon after hearing about Bob Feller's death, wanting to find out more about his life. I thought the most interesting parts were his thoughts concerning the players and games of his era. I was not disappointed. I have often wondered how the athletes of the '30's, '40's, and 50's would stack up against today's players and came away convinced the top athletes would stand the test of time.Bob Feller was a unique individual who put America first and his career statistics far down on the list of his priorities. His love of country was so ingrained in his whole being. I also thought his ""behind the scenes"" promotion of black baseball in his barnstorming tours paved the way for Jackie Robinson and all who followed. We may never see his like again.The real bonus, however, was that when the book arrived, I was surprised to see it was autographed by the author himself.Tom Balsley"
4,Interesting mix of history and shared experience,"An earlier reviewer said that this gives you the feeling of learning Italian history along with Keahey as you read. I know little about Italy and have never been there, so for me this was a good thing. I do think John knew a lot of that history already, and appreciate that he was sharing it with me, rather than preaching it at me. That kept me engaged.And just often enough he steps out the history and into the environment around him, and those times are magical. He is sensitive to the world around him, and I can see, hear, smell and taste what he is experiencing in those times.This is certainly a different kind of book, to me, with its mix of history and current experience. I found it a good place to start in learning about this place."
1,I Don't Think So,"Something about this book just isn't right. Who has this kind of detail for memories going back 25 years? I think there is a lot of fact here and a whole lot of made up BS, this guy is just too clever and full of himself. This is a low life con man and crook who made some money cheating the casinos, and now wants to tell his life story so somebody in Hollywood will make a movie out of it. The book reads as if it was written to be made into a movie, like was done with 'Catch Me If You Can'. Frank Abagnale was a kid when he did his crimes, he was a sympathetic character. Marcus pulls cons and delights in standing back and laughing at the victims. What kind of person does that? Not the kind Hollywood makes movies out of, apparently. He acts like he's some kind of American Hero, when he's just another crook who didn't get caught."
4,Wonderful addition to any Vampire Lovers Collection,"Great graphics, as well as a very intriguing story line. I can't wait to see what happens next. If you love vampires, here's one more that you'll love to hate."
2,Ok..nothing spectacular.,"I bought this item at my specialty supermarket. I would say I am not a novice at baking but I have a long way to go to make professional pastries. Since using the parchment paper, my cookies bake more evenly. The parchment paper comes in a roll with a edge to tear (think of an aluminum roll) it is suppose but to convenient but its such a hassle. The cutting edge is dull and the paper tends to slip so there is never a clean even cut. This urks me to no avail, since have to resort to using scissors, what a waste of time. Another thing, since its a roll and not a sheet, the paper never seems to lay completely flat on the cookie sheet, resulting in aggravation on my behalf. Overall I won't be buying parchment paper in rolls again, I will invest in the re-usable type which once cut lays flat on the cookie sheet."
4,How and Why We Should forgive,Holding onto past events that bring negative feelings and hold us back from looking and moving forward is distructive for ourselves. This book helps in small doses to see steps to walk through to realize why we react to situations that we don't understand. We cannot heal ourselves by ourselves. The writer helps to work with you to see how we can realize more intensively how and why we hurt and how to forgive even the hardest of people that you feel we hate to even think about forgiving.
2,Forgive and Forget: Healing the Hurts We Don't Deserve,Again Lewis Smedes disappoints. This is a great subject with lots of potential for expounding on solutions and answers that everyone has about how to heal hurts. There are lots of good books on the subject of forgiveness--all of them better than this one.
3,Heat sink mounted wrong,Nice Power Supply for the money.However: the heat- sink (in the back- behind a slotted cover) is mounted wrong. The fins are oriented horizontally- not vertical as they should be. Even in good old China the technicians should know better....
3,Texts And Contexts,The book is in decent conditions- It was rated (good) but I would say it's acceptable. There's is a few scribbles here and there. But the book is readable. Great on Shipping.
3,U CALL THAT A NEW BOOK ?,"I can't believe what I just received!At first, I thought I had ordered an Used book!! But when I checked on my account! It actually was a NEW BOOK sold by AMAZON!!!"
2,Writer With An Agenda,"The Lost Religion of Jesus was quite a disappointment. The subject of religion in the era between Hillel and Marcion has been of interest to me for many years. When I saw this book advertised I hoped it would give me new insights into this fascinating time. Halfway through the second chapter I could predict where the entire book was leading: to a poorly supported argument for becoming a vegetarian.So why did I give it two stars instead of one? The author did make some interesting points about Jesus' opposition to animal sacrifice. His argument that the Sadducees were threatened by Jesus' assault on their 'cash cow' were valid. However, to then attack Paul because he supported eating meat, and disguising it by rehashing some tired, overanalyzed differences between Paul and the disciples was lame. So was most of the book."
5,This book shows the landscape about how the great companies use OD and HRD,"I think this is for the practitioner. In fact it is lack of accademic focus, but it has the great merit to show how the OD and HRD is implemented in field actually . Throuhg this book I can see the overall landscpe of practical OD."
5,The Lack of Leadership,As a graduate student in International Relations I study the effects of poor leadership all over the world. So you can imagine how important insightful words on leadership are in this day and age. Mr. Carter has given us the tools to make us better leaders all we have to do is use them! I highly recommend we all read this book.
4,what I was looking for,"Easy set up and use. Fits around ear with glasses well. Not sure of durability yet, only had it a month. So far so good. My hearing is poor in one ear. I use it in my good ear and can still hear conversations and use my second phone without having to remove the headset. Headset sound quality is great."
3,Great Headset....not so great range,"I've been reading everyone's reviews and like many, I love the way it's designed. Battery life is great and it's quick to charge. It's lovely to look at and easy to use. But my range sucks. If I go a few feet away, I always run teh risk of losing my call because of a weak signal. I rarely use the headpiece now because of that unless I'm washing dishes and need my hands to be free.I love it...just wish I could be on one side of my apartment and leave my phone on the other and still be able to use the headset."
3,Mostly pleased,"Overall the sound quality is good and I can hear much better than with the over the ear models. The only problem is interference and signal strength. When I am even just a few feet away from my cell phone the signal strength starts to fade. Also, sitting in my office or any other room for that matter, I get a lot of interference in the headset. This is a good head set for the car but not so good anywhere else."
1,Incompatible with Treo 650,"I purchased this item to be used with Palm Treo 650, and it is terrible. The ability to understand the caller is minimal. The caller's voice sounds so muffled that one would think the caller is mumbling. Do not purchase this device. Amazon's return policy absolutely stinks and you will lose most of your money. Do not purchase this device."
1,Flip a coin!,"Reading the other reviews, it seems that either you'll get a working unit and love it, or you'll get a unit that crackles, spits, and distorts if it's more than 13 inches from the phone, or if it's blocked by some impermeable object, like, say, a piece of paper or..your ear.I did not love mine.I think I'll get an Aliph Jawbone and move on."
2,Not very good,"1st month, very good. 2nd month, dropping calls and no one can seem to hear me. It was like I was not on a wireless bluetooth. It was bad having to always disconnect this because everyone on the other line could not hear or understand me. I replaced this after 2 months with the Samsung WEP and have had no problems. Not worth it."
1,Jabra BT250v Bluetooth headset,"I already had a bluetooth headset (Motorola), but had trouble with it in the wind. Hence, I ordered the Jabra because it was advertised as a noise-cancellation headset that was particularly good at cancelling wind noise. It's the pits. It should be advertised as a noise-amplification head set. The far-less-expensive Motorola is not good in the wind, but much better than the Jabra."
3,"Good, but not for all ears?","There's a lot to like about this headset. Big plus: sound quality is great, and it's loud enough (I'm hard of hearing, so that's a big deal.)The chief drawback for me is that the earpiece part won't stay in my ear when worn ""properly,"" wrapped around the ear. If I don't try to wrap it around, I can actually get it to stick in for a while, but obviously that doesn't last. So for me, it's not ""hands-free"" at all, as my right hand has to hold it in place. Not sure whether my ears are too big, too small, or just oddly shaped, but some adjustability would be welcome."
1,Horrible Headset,I have been using this headset for 5-6 months now. The original one I bought would have problem with static if the headset was not in direct line of vision from my phone. I had the manufacturer send me a replacement headset. This has the same problem. I will not buy a Jabra again.
3,Jabra BT250v,"Jabra BT250V is one of the best bluetooth headsets for older bluetooth phones. Does not work as well with iPhone, or the new Motorola V9, but maybe that's the phones fault?! The vibration feature and battery life are great. Needs a case to protect it from breaking when not in use and carried in a purse or briefcase."
2,Awful sound,I purchased this item for my fiance' and he was thrilled since it has larger control buttons and it also vibrates. We have had to return for a replacement twice because of static and feedback when making and receiving calls. We have returned it three times to Jabra for replacment because we felt it was defective but after three replacements and still the same problems exist in my opinion it is just not a quality product.Would not recommend this product for purchase.
2,Muffled,"The unit was for my wife. She liked the fit and the fact that it was hidden and didn't make her look like she is from Star Track. She could hear very well, but her voice was muffled on the other end. We tried two of these units and had the same problem."
2,very limited range,"I just bought this to replace the BT800 I have. I was after something that fits more securely and is not as heavy (the 800 is like trying to hang a brick from your ear with a rubber band). The 250V is definitely more comfortable, but that's all. It is far inferior in all other aspects. The range is claimed to be 30 feet. I get maybe 1 foot before static is unbearable. I might as well use the headset if I have to hold it next to my ear anyway!Also, this may be a quirk of the phone that I use (motorola v330), but when this headset is turned on, it immediately triggers the voice name function which I have to kill. I could live with that if the range was better...Tomorrow I am returning it. I am going to try the motorola models next."
5,Great when you get what you paid for...,"I'm very pleased with the Jabra bt500v. I have some frequency loss in my right ear and voices come through clearly. This is not the case with many of the others. No one I've called has noticed any difference between my using it or, not using it. It pared quickly and easily with my Blackberry 8700c, which is carried within a leather holster on my belt. In terms of comfort, I hardly know it's there. I don't give 5 stars often but the JABRA has earned them."
2,Jabra BT500V - a bad product.,"Comparing to Jabra BT250, the BT500v has a poor appearance, is not much better quality, but its price is much more. I would not recommmend this product."
4,Works good but there's noise,"Well, I've been using this product for a month now, and I had used it in the past also - I liked the performance, except that it only really works well when both the phone and the headset are on the same side of your body. Otherwise there's lots of noise. However, I'd go on to say it's much better than anything else I've used (which I admit, hasn't been much!). The set of 4 ear-bud-thingies I got with it are a great touch - one of them will fit everyone's ear. And the vibrating feature is excellent - cos when I'm driving and the music is playing real loud in the car, I can't hear the phone ringing. But when the headset starts to vibrate on my ear, there's no way I'm missing any calls."
2,Jabra 250V None Support,"My first Jabra 250V worked very well for just over one year. Then, I started to have volumn and static problems. When I called the manufacturer in Canada and asked where to send the unit for repair, I was told ""Just throw is away and order another""....""We warrant the device for one year, and after that, there IS NO SUPPORT !!"" If something malfunctions, like a battery, or charging cradle, you are forced to just purchase another complete unit....pretty sweet deal for Jabra, huh ?"
2,Does not work well with V3 Razor,I purchased this BT headset based on a friends recommendation to use with my Motorola Razor as a replacement for my Plantronics Voyager 510. At least with my Razor the sound quality was sub-par on both ends. I have experimented with several BT headsets and so far nothing comes close to the quality of the Voyager 510.
4,Great headset but...,"I've had three Jabra BT headsets now. The original 250 and then 2 of the 250 v's. They sound great, they feel great and the battery charge lasts a very long time.My issue is with wind noise. If you try to use these in even a mild breeze the person you're talking to will be unable to hear you.A secondary issue is with the plastic piece that Jabra uses to hold the earbud into place. On all three of my headsets this piece has come loose. One actually cracked, the other two just popped out. It only took a few seconds to glue it back in place, why can't Jabara spend the extra 2 cents and just use more glue to begin with?"
5,Jabra & Razor work great!,"I read hundreds of reviews and found them more confusing than helpful. All I can tell you is that the Jabra BT250v works great with the Razor. Good fit, comfortable, good battery life, works great in the car and I especially like the fact that it can be worn on either ear."
3,Amazon's shipping policies stink,"I know this is a world class blue tooth device, but because Amazon doesn't let you select a shipper in the ordering process I can never buy through Amazon again. When I put in my street address, Amazon used the USPS which will only deliver to my Post Office box. When I put in my PO Box (different item) Amazon immediately came up with an error stating I could not use a PO Box. So if I can't use a street address or a PO Box I have to bid Amazon goodbye."
1,Jabra BT250V wasted money,"Purchased the Jabra BT250V bluetooth headset for an LG VX8300 cell phone. It's advertised as a 33 foot range, 2to3 foot is more like it. Anything more than 3 feet the audio is unusable. With cell phone on hip the distance is too much and audio is garbled. As soon as you take it out of the package and try it JoWow (Manufacturer)considers the unit used and they won't take it back for sanitation reasons, so I was told. I have not been able to get anyone from Amazon to return my e-mail or help resolve the problem either. The bottom line is the BT250V is a total piece of junk and it looks like I will take it on the chin for dealing with Amazon and JoWow. Never again!"
4,Best Bluetooth Headset,"The Jabra BT250v is great.It has good talk time, with frequent use 2 days between charges.The volume is great, clear and loud.BUT, the setup takes a bit. I had to try almost 15 times, before my B.Berry detected it. Once paired, it worked wonders!If it didn't take so long to pair with my B.Berry, I would of rated it a 5 instead of a 4"
2,NOT HAPPY,This ear piece has so much static unless I put the phone right next to my earpiece. When it is fully charged the blue light goes out. The light only goes out on this one if its plugged up for three days. I had the bt250 last year and it was fine. I don't know if the seller has a bad batch bt250v with vibrating alert or Jabra should have left a good thing alone.
1,Not worth the price,"It's not necessarily always true that you get what you pay for. When it comes to the Jabra BT250v, you'd be better off buying the cheapest Plantronics, or any cheap Walmart headset. The Jabra BT250v has a horrible connection and static is a constant bother. The useable ""wireless/bluetooth"" distance was less than an arms-length away.I would not use, nor would I recommend this product. When is comes to Bluetooth devices, I've found the cheaper, the better."
1,Returned two of these.,"This unit only works well when it's two feet away and line-of sight of my V551. Forget about putting the phone in your pants pocket or on your hip (even on the same side of the body as the headset). After calling Jabra customer service and being assured that the unit should work as I was applying it, I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon. Of course, customer service isn't going to tell you that they have a mediocre design... I returned the second one last week in excange for a Motorola HS850.In the end, cool physical design, poor electronic design!"
2,Returned twice and each time new problem,"First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter. Worked fine, except that the vibrate feature won't work. Then I exchanged it for another one. This time the vibrate works, but the call pickup button would not work. It works for power up/power down. But I can't pickup any incoming calls. The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality. I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work. I already exchanged the jabra adapter once. Now I'm sick of exchanging it. I think jabra has bad quality control. Someone in the quality control shd be fired! Everytime you exchange something, you run into a new problem."
1,absolute junk,"The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal (which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO). Otherwise, it was horrific - static, terrible sound quality, etc. Please do not waste money on that POS. I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815."
2,Lifetime of unreplacable battery: just beyond 1 yr warranty,"I got a BT200 (appears to be nearly the same as the BT250v) 15 months ago. It worked well and I liked it a lot despite annoying background clicking and short battery life. Now, after just over a year, its battery often won't last a day of standby let alone conversations. Jabra support says they have no spare parts or service and offered me a 20% discount on a new one. In other words, beware that this is a disposable product! I also have a BT-110, which uses a AAA cell that has much longer life and can be removed for recharge and/or replacement."
1,Can't believe how bad it worked,"I'll start out by saying that I purchased this unit because I heard such great things about it, it received very high ratings, and my friend owned one and was relatively happy with it. I say that because it may just be my phone. I have a Treo 700p and it was awful with it. If the phone was six inches away from the unit, it only had a little static and a low grade hum. If I had it by my side (approximately three feet away), there was so much static that the person could no longer hear me. I have since used other Bluetooth headsets that my friends owned to see if it was my phone. They sounded fine. The one thing I do give this headset is that it fit great in my ear. Too bad it doesn't work."
1,JABRA GIMMIE A BREAK!!!!! NOT FOR THE TREO 650,"WARNING!!, I bought this Jabra BT250v headseat to go with my Treo 650. This is the WORST piece of crap in the world. I don't know what the hell Jabra was thinking and this headset works like a piece of JABRA!! You will get static and crackling so loud Helen Keller could hear it!! It would not sync, I got a loud piercing noise when trying to use it, it kept resetting my phone, the features they promise I ASSURE you WILL NOT WORK and DON'T EVEN THINK about walking over 3 cm from your phone!!! It is a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREEET (at least for the TREO 650)!! I took it back in 2 days and swaped it for a new one (thinking that one must have been defective)BUT...same deal so I took that one back as well. However, I was still thirsting for more. Thinking I would give this one more shot I bought the Jabra BT500 and I'll be returning that as soon as I finish typing this.Bottom line: great Ergonomic design but it works best if your already deaf!!!!"
1,Works horribly with a Treo 650,"Got this for my Treo 650, and the static was horrible on it. It basically worked as long as there was a direct line of sight to the handset. Meaning that if I swung my arm between the Treo and the headset, I would get momentary static.The Treo 650 is very touchy with the bluetooth devices it works with, and only the Palm headset and the Sony headsets have consistent success with them.This headset would probably have been fine on another phone, but on my Treo, is was terrible. Hate to give it a 1 since it probably works fine, but I gots to call 'em like I see 'em."
2,Comfortable for whom?,"I bought this based on the reviews saying how comfortable it is. The first thing you have to do it get it on your ear, which I found clumsy and irritating. I couldn't just quickly attach it to my ear. It was a pain to get on. Then, once on, the little gel earpiece, which will fall off multiple times as you try to get the thing on your ear, has to face the proper direction. Ach, it is not pleasant. Once on, the sound is really good. However, contrary to everything I've read, it was NOT comfortable, and I had to remove it after a 30 minutes or so. I wear glasses and have average sized ears. And don't get me started on the buttons.I went out and bought a Motorola 850 and it's been working just peachy. Easy on, easy off, and the sound is fine. Some people may not be turning the volume on the earpiece up _on the phone_, and hence the 'not loud enough' complaints. It doesn't feel as snug as the Jabra, but it's much more comfortable."
2,Great if you have gigantic ears!,"I wish I had never purchased this headset. Yes, the sound is good if you can manage to get it to stay on your ear. It's stupid design makes it hard for people with small ears to use at all. It is awkward to get it on and it doesn't want to stay on. I've lost tons of ear gels off of it also."
2,Would not recomend,This is my first blue tooth ear piece and I don't like it at all. Hard for me to hear at times and hard for people to hear me. They definitely hear a lot of wind if I'm not in my car. Doesn't work if phone is not RIGHT on my body... and sometimes it starts to cause problems if it's on the opposite side of my body as the phone. Lot's of static at random times. I often end up turning it off and talking without a headset so people can hear me. I would not recommend this product. The positives are that it was inexpensive and it works sometimes. I suggest that you pay more and get a better product.
1,Junk,"Poor range. Static when a body part got between the phone and headset. Poor volume.A definite ""don't buy"""
3,Okay for bigger ears...,"My husband has the BT250 and loves it so I decided to give it a try before getting my own. I hated it. Great sound quality, but very uncomfortable. I liked the idea that the majority of the headset went behind the ear (hidden behind my hair) and it looks great on my husband, but it was big, heavy and clunky and hurt my ear after 5 minutes. Not great for people with small ears. I also hated the feel of the ear gel inside my ear. It comes with 3 sizes, but all felt like ear plugs. I couldn't imagine wearing it for extended periods. The sound, however, was good and I feel strongly that the ear gel is the reason. It channels the sound directly into your ear canal. I wish it could have been more comfortable."
1,Static and feedback a SERIOUS problem,"I purchased this product NEW IN BOX, but from CompUSA, which is going out of business - all sales final. My mistake! The static is outrageous on this thing - 60-70% of the time, even if I hold my phone 2 feet away (at which point, why even have a bluetooth?!??!) And if I turn up the volume to hear over the static, the listener gets serious feedback.This is ridiculous! I tried it with both my ATT Iphone AND my US Cellular Motorola Razor. Bad reception everytime = TERRIBLE static if I even move my arm between the phone and the headset; inaudible if I turn my head away. And yes, it IS on the same side of my body. MY GOSH - I even tried it with the phones TWO FEET AWAY from the headset - static. Very very disappointed. I had a Nokia BH900 - which I lost, so I thought I'd try this one. It's going to charity."
5,Better than the rest,Linked up easily to my Sony Ericcsion T637. The voice quality and battery time compared to other headsets is superb! far exceeds other headsets i had tried from work. Excellent voice quality and battery time!
3,Not for small ears,"This headset works very nicely in regards to the sound quality. I have a smaller head, however, and I cannot get this headset to stay on my ears very well. I think that if my ears were taller, it would work better, but as it is, this headset does not fit me very well. It is also a little awkward to get on and off, especially if you are trying to quickly put it on to answer a call."
3,Jabra 250,"I've had this headset for a while now. It works great in quiet environments but the mic accents noises like water running, wind, etc. The design is great and fairly comfortable compared to over-the-ear styles. The battery life is pretty good. I have had issues with my E815 dropping signal after first seeking the Jabra. If the mic wasn't so sensitive it would be awesome."
4,Bluetooth with Blackberry 7290,"I like the form of the Jabra, and the way I feel comfortable with the way it sits behind my admittedly larger ears. The sound cancellation works well though you can tell you are not on a land line. My one complaint is that the extra features do not work with a blackberry, and the phone must be in line of sight of the headset for the bluetooth connection to function well."
2,Loved it when it worked-which was 3 months,"I love the style of this piece, it really feels secure on your ear. It does make my ear hurt after it has been in there for a couple of hours and leaves my ear irritated.I loved the sound while it worked but after about 3 months, it no longer will connect to my Motorola V710. The bluetooth on my phone is working properly so it appears to be a software incompatibility, despite it being listed as acceptable for this model. I wish other Bluetooth models came with this style."
2,Decent,"ive had it about a year now, the performance & sound quality are fine, but its big & ugly & the removeable rubber earpieces come off very easily. I've lost 2 of the earpieces and am lucky ive still got the 3rd. i thought the behind-the-ear feature would help the headset not fall off so i wouldnt lose it as easily, but its pretty bulky and inconvenient to position behind the ear so i just stick the rubber piece in my ear & then have this huge thing on the side of my face. i am going to get a much smaller bluetooth soon, without earpieces that come off so easily."
2,cheap plastic earpiece assembly broke after 3 hours of use,"I hardly ever use it, had it for 3 months, sound was okay. Buttons on/off, voume up and down hard to manage on your ear. All that was cool, I just needed it for the car occasionally with my blackberry.went to use it yesterday and it had broken, the part the earbud connects into had cracked. I don't put it in my pocket, it just sits in a protected part of my purse.I used it maybe a total of 3 hours.no way to call jabra, you have to email them. It's trashed. I'll never get another piece of electronic from them again."
3,It's so-so,"For a mid range priced device it's not horrible. It has a very comfortable design with a car visor clip to cradle and charge your device anywhere. The connection process with your phone is a little complicated and will occasionally need a reset for some unexplained reason. But the sound has the potential to sound very good.My biggest problem with this device is that if the phone is not in direct site of the ear piece, the quality of sound dramatically drops off. Even if the phone is in the pocket of your pants on the other side of your body from the device the quality drops off simply because your body is in the middle. The range estimate is solely based off of direct line of site where no bodies, walls, doors, cars or anything else are between the device and the phone."
5,Very Happy with Headset,"I use this with a Cingular 3125. This is my first bluetooth headset, and so far it works great (2 months). I did have a problem where it stopped syncing with my phone. I called tech support and they were very helpful in resetting the unit. I was surprised at how quickly I reached a live person."
2,unacceptable range,the range for good singnal is unacceptable. you hear statics as soon as you put the phone to your right side and your head set to the left. statics develope from 5 feet on out.
3,"Great features, battery, loudness, but audio quality falls short.","All of the features worked as advertised, but I cannot give this 5 starts because of audio quality issues. Even with my phone (Nokia 6126, Bluetooth 2.0) in my pants pocket on the same side as the headset, it still suffered from frequent static."
1,Jabra BT250v Disappointment,"Dear Amazon:Thanks for the opportunity, to review this product.I ordered the Jabra 250v Bluetooth Headset in early July. When I placed the order, I had high expectations.The headset did arrive quickly. Then, it stopped working almost as quickly! Within three weeks, the button that is used to power on the device simply stopped working. I could not believe it!Unfortunately, I could not locate the paperwork, so I could return it, for an exchange. So, I guess I'm out of luck on this one. Without the packing paperwork and/or warranty information, I'm not sure if I have much recourse.(NOTE- If you know of some provision, whereby I might be permitted to still return the device, please let me know. If not, I understand.)I did, however, want to take this opportunity, to respond to your review inquiry.Thank you.Sincerely,Gary D. Stubbs"
3,Bluetooth Headset,This is much better product than the motorola bluetooth headset. Pros are the snug fitting around the ear and the ear budd inside your ear. Cons is the static. Bluetooth headsets have long way to go to be effective still.
1,jabra bt250,"I used it twice then it fell apart and couldn't be put back together within 2 weeks, and became unusable.Jabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [Retail Packaged] Also have gotten no reply from seller."
3,Fragile,"I've used this earpiece as has my wife. We both liked it, when it worked, but after a short drop from the dashboard to the carpeted floor, it stopped working. I also think it's a bit large, in these days of ever smaller bluetooth devices."
4,Product Good--Service Bad,"I really like the headset--comfortable, easy to use, etc. The sound quality is great. Getting the product here from Amazon was a different matter. They take poor customer service to a new low."
4,Excellent Headset!,"Much more comfortable than the Motorolas! Earpiece fits snugly in ear, and unit wraps behind hear. Sound and clarity are fine. Can move around, and unit will not fall off ear, unlike the Motorolas."
3,"Poor fit, nonadjustable","Fine sound quality. Good microphone quality. Good battery life. Poor fit and no adjustments. It's fine as long as I'm sitting or standing without moving too much. Bend one way or the other and the unit falls off my ear. Also, solved the blinking LED problem with a tiny piece of black electrical tape."
4,"Jabra BT250v, must have? YES","The Jabra BT250v w/Vibrate option is useful. It vibrates so if your phone is in your bag, or you can't hear the ring; you would still realize the incoming call. Distance is okay, similar to their base BT250 model. Not sure about 30feet though, maybe if you're in the desert with no other interference. Plus this unit is fairly light on your ears but you'll need 2 hands to put it on your ear. I have try the BT250, and Motoroloa HS850."
4,"Very comfortable, good performance","My favorite thing about this headset is the way it sits comfortably and securely on the ear, even when checking your blindspot or other sudden head movement. The sound quality is good, the vibrating alert is a nice feature, the battery life is decent.The only complaint I have is that it has to be re-paired if you let the battery get too low, but the pairing process is very simple so it's only a minor irritation."
2,"Good sound, but very fragile.","I'm on my third replacement unit.They've all worked well, with at least a few days of use between charges, and have good sound (though I do get complaints from time to time that the person on the other end of the call can hear my background noise).My problem with them is that they keep breaking apart on me. There's a joint between the main body of the unit and the panel with the buttons on it which has come apart on all three units I've tried. Maybe I'm rough on them? I do carry it in my pocket when it's not in my ear, but I don't really beat on them or anything.By the way, this unit is USELESS in the wind. Huge amount of background noise. Literally unusable. Not sure if all headsets have the same problem, but this one has it bad.The unit performs well when it's working, but I'm ready to give up on this one and find something better."
1,Great headset if you don't mind the 4 foot range,"I agree with the reviews touting its nice appearance and comfort fit. However, the particular unit I recieved had very poor sensitivity/range. When setting at my desk, a small desk fan over 4 foot away produced noticable 'wind noise'. I was unable to wear it in my left ear with my phone clipped on my right side without signicant static. Even setting my phone on a picnic table and moving about 4 foot way to put firewood on a campfire produced static and breaking up effects. Maybe I just got a bad one. i did retun it eventually and am looking for something else"
3,"Great reception, providing....","I like this headset but will have to limit the usage to the car. It comes in clear and loud which is good. But this is only the case if it's on the seat next to me.If I am out and about and it is on my left side forget about reception. Even in a jacket pocket on the ride side increases static by 25% easy.If you want something for the car I would reccomend this. If you want an all around headset, pass."
3,Jabra BT500V,The product hurts my ear. I've tried to adjust it and it still irritates a spot on my ear. The product works okay otherwise.
3,It's OK,"I read up on this headset and chose it based on the reviews. It is a little large for my ear and falls off sometimes. Also, it's tricky to turn the volume up or down while using. The reception and voice quality are pretty good - better than others I have used."
4,A Very Good Bluetooth Headset!,"This is my first Bluetooth headset and here is my review. I did a lot of searching for a headset on this site and many other websites and this headset was the one I choose based on the reviews. Buy from Amazon they had the best price. I had it now for 3 weeks and I use it with a Nokia 6102i Cell Phone and it pairs with no problems at all. I am very happy with it so far. Battery life is very good, fits on my ear with the longer ear gel perfect, it weights very little for a bigger headset, sound is clear and loud, and people hear me with no problems. The only con I have is the range is a little less than 30 feet. I get static if I walk to far away from the phone. So for my first Bluetooth I think I made the Right Choice."
4,Jabra BT250v,I feel the Jabra BT250v is a great bluetooth headset. It connected without any issue with my Nextel and works great. I find it to be very comfortable to wear even with glasses.
3,Would Be 5 Stars If I Didn't Wear Glasses,"I bought this headset at the same time as my Verizon Palm Treo 650. Pairing was a snap, and it supported the hands free profile. The call quality was great on both ends (however wind or car A/C caused people on the other end to have lower quality). I only charged it twice - day one and one week later. I used it for about a total of one to two hours a day on my commute.There was just one drawback, and it was a deal-breaker for me. I wear glasses, and the bulk of the headset behind the ear made it very uncomfortable. I returned the headset today after I had to end my call on the way home after 20 minutes. If you don't wear glasses, this is an ideal bluetooth headset for the Treo 650."
2,Comfortable but what good is it if you can't hear,"I purchased the Jabra BT250v since I bought a Palm Treo 650. This was my first attempt at a bluetooth earpiece. I did a little bit of research which was about 80% positive. I chose it mainly for the style and comfort, unfortunately the static wouldn't go away so I returned it. It may have been just that particular item, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning another so I didn't reorder. After more research the second time around I ended up with a Plantronics Discovery 640 which I've been very happy with. Sound quality is great 90% of the time."
1,Would not recommend,"I have had problems with this device. I have experienced loud static and the volume control appears to have some sort of connection problem. I cannot control the volume when using the device. If I attempt to turn the volume up, it will get louder but as soon as I release the control, it decreases to the lowest volume. If I continue to quickly touch and release the volume control, the volume goes in and out. Sometimes I can get it to stay on the loudest volume but most times it gets stuck on the lowest setting. Needless to say, I do not use the device that much any more. I have been careful not to drop this device and have only had it for about three months. I emailed Jabra on 6/8/07 and have not received a response."
3,Mike is too sensitive -,"Almost every person I talk with, using this device, complains that my voice is covered up with ambient noise. It seems the gain is too high. No way to change it. Also, it fits more loosely than the BT500 (lost that one just long enough to buy this one as replacement, then found it, thanks to Murphy's corrolary #245)"
1,Bluetooth sucks,"This thing is ok as far as bluetooth headsets go, but the technology still has a long way to go. Every bluetooth device I have tried is plagued by static noise and low volume levels. I am glad this was a gift and I did not have to pay for it!"
1,25 years on...,"I bought one of these books which had a lot of great trips. Unfortunately when I set out, one road had a housing estate built on it and other attractions no longer existed. I should have noted the publication date and bought something more up to date."
2,Loved it until it broke forever,"Stay away! After using (and loving) this machine for 6 months, the grinder stopped working. After 3 calls with Saeco trying different grinder settings, they finally agreed to repair it. I sent it back, and after 4 weeks it was returned with a note saying that the grinder setting was too low. They were very pleasant on the phone, and agreed to repair it (again). After another 4 weeks, I got the unit back with a similar note about the grinder setting. I was furious and videoed the first cup I made. Yep - it broke. I faxed them and called them, but they refused to take my calls (7 times). I think it was because I hinted they may be incompetent."
1,Good Quality But Unnecessary,"These are fine tapes, but there is no need to spend so much money on them.By design, DV and HDV tapes are identical.The only difference is the price."
2,Lost Vital Footage!,"Well, I shot a wedding and this tape has cost me big time. I am using a new Canon XHA1 and these tapes. I should about 2 0tapes with no issues. WHy did I have to have a failure on a nice young couples wedding night!!? I unwrapped a new tape, proceeded to record. The lcd viewer showed fine. Upon reviewing the tape for edit, my heart sank as all I can see is blue!! No actual video to be found! The time stamp is there, and the sound is there, but only blue on the playback. I'm certain these people will sue me. Wow do I look foolish.I read a few reviews and comments on other sites, it's the tapes. My cam is new, the heads were cleaned and again, brand new tape.:("
3,"For this price, it should include cassette memory, no?","Probably a decent quality tape but I can't speak to the longevity issue, as I only just received them. I thought I was ordering top of the line tapes that include the cassette memory recommended by Sony for my new 3CCD camcorder. These tapes do not have cassette memory.Turns out I don't need that feature, as I've learned the hard way not to use the camcorder for anything but filming and then offloading the files to hard disk for subsequent editing with Adobe Premier. (Use the tape drives on camcorders to do fancy editing or repeated viewing at your camera's peril. I just tossed out my Canon GL2 because the drive mechanism froze.)"
2,"Tapes brand new, but not packaged as advertised","The tapes came very quickly, but rather then getting a 2-Pack as advertised, I got an envelope with two single tapes, not packaged for resale. If I knew I was buying tapes from a bulk reseller, I would've expected the price to be much lower.I have not tried the tapes yet, so cannot vouch for their quality. I'm sure they'll be fine."
2,Better prices can be found on these!,"This is (I guess) better quality tape than the standard...BUT you can get it MUCH cheaper (same SONY product exactly) for a LOT LESS from other venders. I got several packs of five for about $7.00 per tape! Check the net and save on these! Forget getting them at Circuit City or Best Buy, if you can even find them....even MORE expensive! Time will tell...and editing if this product is worth the extra bucks."
2,Unreliable,"We've been using these tapes on both a Canon HV20 and XHA1 and they are having a tendency to drop out several seconds right after we start recording and occasional drop frames later. At first we thought it was one of the cameras, or a head cleaning issue, but this is happening on two cameras, and two different models at that. We've missed some vitally important footage because of this. Though we don't have the problem on every tape, it happens frequently enough that we will not be using them again."
3,"overpriced for ""consumers"" but great quality","As a few of you may know this HDV tape is top of the line in quality video. Panasonic makes a really solid tape as well, although i experienced more drop-out with Pany tapes. The reason i gave it 3 stars is because sony came out with a new tape HDM63VG. The new tape is videography grade, and the quality is awesome! The biggest benefits of the new tape is the price. 1/2 the price of the red label HDV from Sony. You can only buy them online at authorized sony stores for now, but will probably hit mass market here shortly. If you want to buy a great quality tape and don't care out the price, The ones your looking at are as good as it gets."
2,stick with regular dv,"I've used both these tapes, and standard mini dv tapes. I see no difference really. I also save about $10 per tape by just buying standard DV tapes in bulk."
4,good product - high price,"I use these tapes with my Sony HDR-HC7 HD camcorder to capture video of my duaghter. Some say its overkill to use these tapes, but I'm more concerned about not losing the best moments of her childood.I've never had any dropout or problems with these tapes. A little more expensive than the competition, but you'll never regret the quality of the recording."
1,lame,"My son was very excited to get this. He used it once and then never again. I was upset that he wasn't using it, but then I read it with him and I knew why. It is definitely not as good as the other Leapfrog products."
4,You get what you pay for,"Honestly, for the price, I think this is a fairly good set of knives. This was my upgrade from very cheap knives, and the set has held out well so far. The knives are sharp enough to do the job and handle well. Don't expect an expensive set for cheap, but they make a great starter set."
1,They Cut Cheese,"These knives are priced extremely well but will absolutely not hold a sharp edge. The steak knives are just cheesy bits of stamped metal that are almost as flimsy as plastic.It would be better to slowly assemble a quality set over time if you must be budget conscious. Also, there are better set choices for just $50 or so more."
2,Relatively Poor,"I bought this a year ago for a meditation timer. I love the size, and when it works, it's perfect. However, it seems to go through the batteries quickly, and it requires two which cost $5 each at Radio Shack. It' cheaper to buy a new product than replace the batteries.Having said that, I'm buying a second because it is so convenient. (The original died after a year.)Also, be aware that it is a cheap product from China. The instructions are obtuse, and setting the timer may require several pushes of the appropriate button, if you understand how it works.Good luck--but I'm ordering a second.---Go figure!"
1,Eats batteries,"The product works ok when the batteries are fresh, but the batteries ran down in days, where I was expecting months. Not recommended."
4,Vibrating Alarm Clock and Timer,"Excellent product. Keeps me on track. Would recommend for others to use to keep track of time, appointments or cooking."
2,bad quality/great features,"We bought this for our staff to do an exercise and they worked great for a little while. One drop, though, and they would not work any more. For instance, mine was on vibrate mode on the countertop and vibrated right off the counter. The alarm/vibrate function never worked again. I like the features and the size it offered but the quality is just not there."
1,Imitation Hijacking Old Reviews of Another Brand,"Take a look at the reviews..almost all of which are several years old and they mention different brands entirely. This person has just found an old listing that no one was using that had some favorable reviews. and inserted their own product name in the title. Here are some of the other brands mentioned. gold foot patches,BodyRelief Foot Pads Package of 10 Patches, lavender, Gold Detox Foot Patch and Tourmaline Gold Detox Foot Patches. The real thing is terrific. Cheap imitations that cheat by hijacking other product reviews are not!"
2,Who Knows?,"i gave these a try, figuring it was worth a shot, and eh, I dunno. They looked discolored in the morning, but that could just as easily be attributed to sweat from having something basically taped to the bottom of your feet as it could be to ""toxins"" being pulled out of the body. I eat well and exercise often anyway, so I thought maybe the effects, if any, would be more noticeable, but whatever, I don't feel like they are a rip-off, but I certainly wouldn't buy these again"
3,Gold Detox Foot Patch,I am not certain they really do what intended or what they say. I never notice anything different. Not very clear instructions for use.
1,Really Sloppily Made,I'm not sure if it's just my set but what I received was defective. The spoons had scratches and marks throughout and looked as though they had been battered. I'm not sure if it's the design or what but I didn't like them at all and am returning them.
2,Not 18/10 As Described. 18/8 from China - but otherwise nice quality,"The spoons were lovely - heavy, durable looking, with stamped ml and measurements on each spoon. However, also on each spoon was stamped ""18/8 stainless steel. Made in China"" and the tag that was attached to the spoons said ""Endurance Measuring Spoons"" with a sticker over the tag that was printer printed and said RSVP Measuring Spoons.The spoons also have stamped ENDURANCE.Amazon was great with returns, and I'm returning them because I specifically wanted 18/10 measuring spoons and not 18/8. It would be better if Amazon changed the item description to ACCURATELY represent the product, as 18/8. As long as you don't mind them being 18/8, I would recommend them. For me, I only use 18/10 in the kitchen.Giving 2 stars because actually nice looking and durable spoons, just not represented accurately on the item description."
4,Very sturdy spoons that FIT IN JARS!,these spoons are very good. They are nice and heavy and fit in spice jars perfectly! they are tied together with a chain to make it easy to keep them together.
5,Love them...,I love the shapes of these spoons. They fit great in many spice containers my round ones can't go into. Very sturdy and durable.
1,Warning: These spoons are not standard sizes!,"My spouse and I were very excited to get these spoons as a wedding gift, and have been using them in the kitchen. Just recently, we started noticing that the spoons did not look proportional to each other. Upon calibration, it was discovered that some of the spoons are not as large as they state! The tablespoon actually holds about 2/3 of a tablespoon, and the 1/4 teaspoon holds only about 1/6 of a teaspoon (both are 67% of the stated size). The 1 and 1/8 teaspoons appear to be right on, and the 1/2 and 3/4 teaspoons just a smidgen small. We have concluded that the tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon are too far off to use in recipes...if the recipe allows for that much error, then why measure at all?"
4,"Handy, but could be better","Generally like these spoons because:1. Very durable, heavy-duty.2. Good shape for narrow jars.3. Dishwasher-safe. Have washed many times w/o any visible effect.4. Can be set down on counter when full if you need to (end of one bottle).Could be improved:1. Chain holding them together keeps separating.2. I'd prefer 1/2T to 3/4t (although you can, of course, just use 2 3/4 t.)3. These hold more than many standard measuring spoons, especially the T. This is generally OK with me because I like a heavy hand with spices, but with baking powder, not so much."
5,"Good quality, unique shape",I needed another set of measuring spoons and thought I'd try these out for their unique size and ability to fit into spice jars. They work as advertised and are also surprisingly heavy duty gauge metal. I'm happy with them so far.
4,Wish there was a 1/2 tbsp,"I really like the spice measuring spoon set. The rectangular shape makes it easy to get into bottles (except for the tbsp, which is too large). The only problem I have with this set is that it doesn't include 1/2 tbsp, which I need often! I always have to estimate with the tbsp measuring spoon. Unfortunately, I will most likely buy another set just so I have the 1/2 tbsp on hand for when I need it."
5,Works great,"Spoons are uniquely shaped. Even the tablespoon reaches easily into my spice jars. Spoons seem accurate enough for my purposes, since they are in a household kitchen and absolute precision is not necessary. Stainless steel seems sturdy. Dishwasher safe."
3,"Generally, good, but the chain broke","The spoons work great, but unfortunately the chain that joins them together snapped, so I now have a loose set of spoons."
5,Wow! Really heavy gauge & polished Stainless Steel measuring Spoons.,"What a fine set of heavy gauge & polished Stainless Steel measuring Spoons.I was hesitant to spend the money for these when I was looking for a set.After they arrived I thought what a bargain. Really nice, easy to read and they are narrow enough to fit intomy jars.I just wish the made a smaller set as well, if they do I will buy them too."
2,Wasn't what I was wanting,"Nice quality, but did not include 1/2 Tablespoon measurement. I was really wanting that measurement otherwise I would have kept these."
5,Bought it as a gift.,Great piece to have in a room. The wood is strong and the finish is excellent. Really easy to assemble!
4,A+++++++,VERY WELL BUILT. EASY ON THE EYES. VERY VERY STURDY. NICE LOOKING WOW NICE. HUGE MIRROR. GOOD FOR SEEING HEAD TO TOE
5,Great for the price.,"Bought this for my daughter's room (she's 13). It arrived with no damage, we put it together in less than 5 minutes and it fits great in her room. It looks great! For the price, I would buy it again if I needed another one."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"The mirror was delivered to my door with the box open. There was a crack along the side in the wood near the glass of the mirror. That bothered me, but I wasn't about to send it back over a little crack. Then I took out parts to assemble the mirror the stand. One of the poles was snapped in half. There was no receipt in the box. Returning a big package like this is going to be annoying, especially without return stickers."
2,Different color shown online,It was much lighter online and way too cherry when I received it. The quality of wood is so-so but it cost more to return it then what I paid for it so I'm keeping it.
2,The mirror makes everything look thiner and longer,"I was very exited about the mirror and was happy to get well pakaged, not broken. It was easy to set it up, color is good, nice simple design and ok quality for the price. But the mirror itself just disapointed me - than farther you are from the mirror than thiner and longer everything looks. So it s still ok just to look how your cloth looks on you, but I definitely would like to get more realistic picture.."
2,Mirror,I guess I was expecting a little more than what this mirror is. The mirror looked ok but not great. The finishing was poor with an uneven finish. The is functional but nothing special. I would just buy a behind the door mirror if I could do it again.
5,Good Value,Easy to assemble and very very nice for the price. This mirror is an elegant option for your reflective needs.
5,Frenchi Cherry Mirror,This mirror was exactly what I wanted and came sooner than I expected. It is beautiful. It was in good condition and the instructions for assembly were easy.
4,Decent Size Mirror,"This mirror arrived intact. No cracks in the glass. Shipping took about a week. The instructions are written in semi-English (looks like they may have been sounded out by someone in Asia), but there aren't many parts, so it's easy to put together. The wood frame around the mirror is not a solid oval piece of wood, but several pieces of wood dovetailed together. If you look closely at the front of the mirror you can see the joints. If you have some cherry polish you may be able to hide them better. Seems fairly sturdy once put together. Comes in a single box. The mirror seems to be a bit slimming and you have to angle it to see the entirety of someone of average height."
3,"For $50, it's a good deal. Not perfect, but good","I hate mirrors, but I needed to buy one, so I decided to purchase this inexpensive, antique-like, cherry colored mirror (with shipping, I paid about $50.00). It's not perfect, but it definitely has character. The bottom stand screws in a little crooked (thus the mirror sits a little off kilter), and parts of the wood where the knobs screwed into the bottom upside down V shape were not fully painted, but still, it's cute. If I had paid their supposed $200+ full price, I would have been extremely disturbed. However, for a free standing bang-up mirror that has a little style and color, this is a very cute item of necessity if bought cheaply. Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased."
5,A Good Price,"Vision Decor was quick to answer my questions about the item and shipping date. The mirror arrived today. The quality of the glass is good and the image in the mirror is even. I've had moderately priced full length mirrors before where the reflection was sometimes distorted. That is not the case here.For the price of the item, which includes shipping, I consider this a good buy."
1,Shabby Pressed Wood,"i know many will say ""what did you expect for $35 dollars"" but the pressed wood around the mirror is awful. its the lowest quality pressed wood around. the mirror arrived unbroken,which was a miracle with the way fedex man handles packages. a close inspection of the wood surrounding the mirror reveals the surface is very coarse and soft. very easy to damage, a fingernail can damage the pressed wood. the stand is not very sturdy,and wobbles easily. i would suggest to anyone who wants a floor standing mirror,spend a few extra dollars and get one made of real wood or from a trusted company like sauder (if they make floor standing mirrors)i have many pieces of furniture made by sauder,and i can say its almost as good if not better than real wood (my humble opinion of course)"
3,Sewing mirror!,"An inexpensive, serviceable mirror if you sew or alter your clothes and need to frequently check your fitting. Not fine furniture."
2,Shipping warning!!!,"I can't rate this item yet as it is a Christmas gift.But I want to warn others that not only will the box reflectCHERRY MIRROR all over it, it has a huge drawing on thebox used for shipping as well! NO SURPRISE there!So, if for someone in your own household, go to another vendor!"
3,They cannot get shipment right,I still haven't tried the product. They can't get the order shipment right. Only received the toss machine. I called in to let them know they had a problem based on my experience as well as the previous customer review. They sent a 2nd package the next week. Same problem. Now I have two Toss machines and still NO batting net. We'll attempt a third time.I'm assuming the produt should work well once received. So this review is only on the ordering process.
4,Lo clasico de los clasicos,"Los mas grandes exitos del Three Souls in my Mind. Es bueno el disco como un preambulo a lo que se convirtiera en la leyenda del rock mexicano ""El Tri"""
2,Run a little small,I bought these for my husband - he tried them on and has never worn them. He is a true 8.5 and the 8.5 boots were a bit tight. I wouldn't buy them again....
4,be,the mirror looks good in the ocntemporary bedroom. The packaging was a challenge due to exploding foam. There should be instructions for getting the mirror out of the box. It is sent boxed within a box of dense foam. We had a foam explosion in the house.
2,The picture on the box probably tastes better,"I was really disappointed with these. I think they are way overpriced, don't taste very good (nothing like pizza), and leave a nasty after taste. The only way I could eat them was dipped in something such as hummus and I prefer carrot sticks for that. The picture on the box made them look so yummy :("
1,Good if you like cardboard,"I bought these and was NOT impressed. They tasted like cardboard. I did find if I crunch them up with my potato masher and put them in meatloaf or used for my bread crusted foods, it looses that flavor. I am disappointed I couldn't use them to serve along side another dish."
4,Yummy Snack,"These bread sticks are tres yummy! My whole family enjoys them, even though I'm the only celiac."
1,Too big and wrong color,"(1) There is apparently only one size, and it's about twice the size of my wrist. (I say ""apparently"" because the instructions don't include information on how to adjust the size.)They are basically selling a product that they must know will not work for most people. You'll end up needing to pay extra somehow or other--either to return, exchange, or adjust it.(2) The face is not the color shown in the photos on Amazon. It's a much lighter shade of blue, more like light grey."
5,One of the most well written books addressing strategy.,"David Aaker's writing style, in addition to the content, is exceptional. I feel as if I am in one of his UC classes. This is the closest I will get to that. I live in Chicago!!"
3,wasteful,I just bought this and it does do what it's suppose to do but I find that it wastes so much icing since the tips are huge. Also it's very hard to write with the writing tip with this tool. I'm returning this one to buy the regular 'bags' method.
3,Just received my book,I just got this book and I have thumbed through alot of it so far. I bought it used so it was a great deal. I think this book has alot of ideas on how to decorate a apartment. Can't wait to really get to read it cover to cover.
2,Not what I was looking for....,this book just didn't have any information in it that I didn't already have.
3,I don't know about anyone else,"Maybe I am just sensitive but this movie scared the pee out of me! That owl girl still creeps me out and I have not seen it in years. I don't think I could bring myself to watch it...Other than that, I thought the acting was very nice and the story was well done. Vanessa Redgrave is almost always a winner and she turns in another great performance here.Still, watch out for that owl girl if you watch this..."
4,They Watch,"For an independent film, the movie was pretty good. Some scenes are suspenseful and creepy, but the movie is more of a drama. The film is about a father who is haunted by his dead daughter, and goes looking for her spirit. And a lost soul tries to keep him from finding her. Most of the movie was good, but did drag at points. I was a little disappointed that the movie did not have a lot of frightening scenes, which would have made the movie a little better. But, over all, there is good acting, an interesting plot, and a movie that could have released in theaters (limitedly though)."
3,Low budget; interesting; mysterious,"This movie was a bit odd. I enjoyed it, however. It was a rather low-budget affair, but well done nonetheless. Vanessa Redgrave was wonderful as usual, however I wasn't always convinced of her blindness. The main players were Patrick Bergin and Vanessa Redgrave and the camera was tuned to their attractiveness, both physical and emotional. It felt to me that the other characters (the wife and daughters) were not given as much of the movie budget for pretty clothes or attractive hairstyles. The South is a wonderful backdrop for this mysterious story. Not knowing how Rudyard Kipling (the author of the original short story) would end it was suspenseful ... happy ending or sad?"
5,Total eye opener,"I would have never read or heard of this book if it wasn't for my freshmen year of college. The inital semester the college creates your schedule for you and I had a 200 level Literature course. This was one of our readings. I fell in love with this book. I loved the artwork, her photography, but also how she uses her photography to communicate with cultures around the world. The journal entries are amazing. I have recommended this book to many people since then and am very glad that I got ""stuck"" in that class."
4,The ultimate oncidium picture book,"This excellent pictorial guide is both invaluable as a resource and unmatched in artistic quality. Tackling the systematics, or which species is which, of the Oncidium alliance will no doubt continue for quite some time. This book brings the orchid world 1000 miles closer to that goal. Beautiful artistic renditions of named and unnamed species grace every page of this large tome. This makes an excellent resource for the orchids enthusiast/expert or the best darn coffee table book on oncidiums. I use it as both."
4,Buy here before ebay,"I searched this scrabble game online on ebay and was shocked by the price. We searched all the department stores to find no one carried this collectors box set. I then came to amazon and found this game (that was a christmas gift request) on here for average price of any games in the department store. The case and little letters are all slick black giving it that clean- line look.When we were playing a game on the floor our new puppy ran past us and hit the board,all the block letters stayed in place, the spacing for the letters in the board saved the game."
2,TWO Z's and ONE P!,The board was very lightweight and felt flimsy on it's turntable. The ink was half worn on one of the letter's and instead of two P's and one Z the game included two Z's and only one P. Very poor quality control and way over-priced in my opinion. Very disappointed.
3,Scrabble player,"Nice look but cheaply done. This game is very expensive for what you get, I paid $40 at Borders and feel like I overpayed. The black and silver look nice but the board is cheap plastic and the turntable underneath does not rotate very smoothly. I have played some older versions of deluxe scrabble where the board is raised and when you turn it it will clear your letter rack but in this version (Onyx) you need to make sure your letter rack is far enough away from the game or they will get knocked over when the board is spun. The board spaces is a sticker and it is not smooth, there are bubbles and it is not applied straight. Overall we enjoy the look of the game we would just prefer a little bit better quality or a more reasonable price."
4,My Favorite Scrabble Board,"I'm a scrabble geek. I admit it. I bought this and the deluxe turntable edition at the same time and wound up keeping this one and giving the other away as a present. The deluxe turntable edition screamed ""cheap"" in it's construction (despite the pricetag) and the letters weren't at all secure in their grids- overall really disappointing. However, I LOVE the look of the tiles and board on the Onyx edition, the roomy velvet pouch and the scorekeeping book. REALLY LOVE how the tiles sit securely on the board, the lower profile and the lazy susan feature. This one was the ""keeper"" for me! I've gotten lots of compliments on it from fellow scrabble fiends as well."
4,Great game for us!,"My husband loves scrabble. He's always won. When we bought our first house, I bought a small cheap set to ""get us started"". This past Christmas, he saw the add for the Diamond edition. Researched it, and didn't like the fact that it folded and didn't snap shut. Then I saw this one. Loved it! I love how clean and simple it is. So I bought it, and had to wait to play. Once we did play, it was great. I love the fact that the tiles stay in place (everything is nice and lined up!!), and it turns so nicely. I also love the score keeper. We always used a legal pad. Now we can keep things on permanent record! And the timer is always a nice threat when someone is taking too long. The tiles are a really nice black wood and silver writing(not plastic like I've seen noted). Our only problem is that it is a pretty big box, and had to make a little room to store it."
5,Scrabble Onyx Edition,"Length:: 1:24 MinsI made a short video review of the Scrabble Onyx Edition and the extra goodies it comes with. It's no Franklin Mint edition, but it is a really nice product which will continue to look nice for years to come. Worth the investment if you're looking for something unique and a little more professional looking than the original deluxe version. It also has a solid piece board which will not wear out over time from folding which is a huge bonus in my opinion."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I have to say my first impression of this scrabble board is ""disappointing."" It's honestly not any improvement over the standard board with raised squares and a rotating base. It's pretty much the same thing with a different color scheme so it's almost insulting that they charge [so much] for this. Even though I got mine for half that I still think I paid way too much.On top of that, the quality of the board isn't that good. The silver overlay sticker was laid on slightly crooked and the base is noisy when turned and doesn't rotate smoothly. the first thing i saw when I opened it was a nick in the wood trim around the board, and overall the entire thing is much cheaper and flimsier than it's made out to be in the pictures and description.skip this and go with one of the cheaper models or spend your money on one of the deluxe wood ones."
