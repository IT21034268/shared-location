5,Incredible,"This series was engaging, entertaining, informative and thought provoking. I can't wait to see it again."
5,RX for Survival,Excellent video. I use it as a teaching tool for an epidemiology course (college level). Provides engaging video clips on topics that I used to lecture on. Provides a nice break from lecture. Whole video wonderful for anyone interested in public health.
5,An amazing film,"While this film is a lttle dated, serious health issues in Third World nations continue to be a human tragedy. This DVD and the complementary edition are used in some of the college health courses I teach and definitely open students' eyes.Mark Elliott Miller, MPHUniversity of Phoenix-San AntonioAdjunct Faculty"
3,Respectable debut effort.,"The Nebraska Quotient by William J. Reynolds is a respectable example of latter day hardboiled crime writing. The author touches all the requisite bases and does so with humor and frequent nods to well known pioneers of the hardboiled genre.Narration is provided by an Omaha based PI whose legal name, ironically enough, is Nebraska. Just like his creator, Nebraska is writing his first novel, a detective story similar to this one.The narrative unfolds in 1980s Omaha and revolves around Nebraska's efforts to locate a missing small time pornographer after being hired by the pornographer's femme fatale sister.Written with wit and intelligence, The Nebraska Quotient qualifies as a pretty good debut detective novel."
3,As Hit and Miss as Most Anthologies,"When I saw this, I wondered ""how could I go wrong with Westlake as an editor?"" Well, I forget how much detective fiction is inferior or more about crime than crime-fighting. So we get a very mixed bag. While stories by Simon Brett and Edward Hoch and Shirley Jackson stand out, others by acclaimed writers like Rex Stout and Ellery Queen fall flat. Some tales, especially one by Jack London, are barely readable, and the choice of Sherlock Holmes story for this anthology is uninspired. Still, most of what's here is entertaining and the good stuff begs for me to find more by the better writers."
2,Very confusing,"Was very excited to get this DVD, until I tried it....I have been doing advanced step aerobics for 20+ years and I was totally lost in this!!!! A few of the moves were broken down, but there were many more that should have been explained in much more detail."
5,Great cardio,"She's very good - enthusiastic and likeable. Music has a good beat too. Took me while to get the moves (I still can't do the reverse stomp, double stomp or whatever) - I'm very uncoordinated - that's why I do step at home and not at the gym :) I skip the power-ups - I'm 42 - are you kidding? Don't have that much energy. Highly recommend."
3,Choreography extremely complicated!!!,"As a former step aerobics instructor and current step class enthusiast, I must say that this video is not for the feint of heart. I attend step classes regularly and found the choreography complicated. THIS VIDEO IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!!Amy Bento incorporates a lot of combinations in her routines, but doesn't give you much time to get it down before moving on to the next challenging combo. You definitely get a good cardio workout once you learn the steps. I highly recommend that you watch the video completely before trying it out."
3,Way too complicated,"I couldn't say how many 100's of hours I have logged in step aerobics, and yet the routines in this video are still too complicated. She starts out right out of the gate in multi-step routines I've never heard of with no introduction and no training. Yes, there is a section of the video where you can ""preview"" some of the steps, but not all of them. If you catch on to dance routines quickly, this may be right for you, and it looks like it would probably be fun if it hadn't left me staring at the tv thinking, ""Um. What?"" Big disappointment. I wish I'd spent my workout dollars (and time) on something else."
1,Warning ADVANCED STEP Only,There needs to be a bigger warning sign somewhere on this stating..ADVANCED ADVANCED ADVANCED step exercise. I workout everyday so I'm in really good shape. When I got this in the mail I couldn't wait to throw it in my Xbox and get my workout on. I had to turn it off after the first 15 minutes. Amy didn't explain one move! She just started in..did the step once or twice and moved on to the next one. I usually don't give up on workouts but there was no way that I could call what I was doing a workout. I actually stopped and found that just watching it was a challenge in itself. The CD seems a bit outdated since they outfits are from the early 90's or 80's.I would not recommend this CD unless you're a step trainer at your local gym.
4,"MAMA SAID(Part 1 of 2)-recorded Aug 4, 1996 in Irvine, CA","This CD has 4 tracks 1. Mama Said(5:20) 2. King Nothing-Live(7:51) 3. Whiplash-Live(4:51) 4. Mama Said-Edit(4:42) In the beginning of King Nothing you get to hear James talk to the crowd, then play a little bit of ""It Ain't Like That"" by Alice in Chains..but this live version of King Nothing got me back into listening Load & appreciating it more. The live version of Whiplash gives you a good dose of speed metal at its very best, James really gets the crowd into this song and it is played without flaw. The song ends with the intro to ""My Friend of Misery"", a nice touch. The Mama Said Edit skips the beginning guitar work, but still a good song. It has a country/blues feel to it. I know it's not what you're use to hearing from MetallicA, but at least it's not Rap/Rock. Highly recommended."
5,Load on Mama!,"This song iz particullarly one o' tha better songs on the ""Load""CD. Don't be misinformed. This iz softer than MetallicA's past works o' art. It has some country features written in w/ MetallicA's extremely unique style. Any true Metallifuk would be honored to purchase this rare single.--214"
4,Porter-Cable 13900 5-Inch Standard Adhesive-Back Sanding Pads,"Shipped what they promised. But the real problem I have found with orbital sanders is that crappy hook & loop pads are becoming the norm and that they are horrible. The H&L wears down quickly, no matter how careful you are to sand evenly. The normal Porter Cable, or DeWalt Sanders last 3-5 times longer than the H&L pads. And at about $15 a pop, you could have bought 2 sanders at $45 to $50 each. The industry will not listen to anyone, but PSA Pads (pressure sensitive adhesive)are much better performers, last longer and don't throw sandpaper flying across the shop!"
5,Works Very Well,"Pretty simple product. There are about 30 or so sheets in a package. Take one out and wipe in a circular motion. Gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine. However, if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stains."
4,DVD Wipes,There is really not much you can say about a clean wipe. The product does clean fingerprints on the DVD. I'm very satisfied with the product. If it had come with a small bottle of a cleaning solution it would be even better.
2,Didn't work for me.,"I had a DVD that kept on not playing every other disc l got from Netflix. It would say the disc was dirty or scratched. I gave any one that didn't play a good clean with these wipes but rearly got any to work. Maybe if you had dusty CD's but l never got any sense that this was ""cleaning"". More of a light polish. Didn't work for me."
2,CD DVD wipes,"I was a bit surprised with this product. It was like working with a paper towel. Dried up and did nothing for my CDs or DVDs. It would be cost ineffective to send it back, but would never order it again. Just trashed it."
3,"an okay movie, but predictable","This was a good movie, save for the obviousness of the player and who she was going to end up with. Too predictable for me, a little cliche, but my mom really liked it, since she didn't see the predictability that I did."
4,A fun movie to watch,Hilary Duff does a great job in this light hearted romantic comedy. She portrays Lane Daniels a young journalist trying to make the best of an opportunity to land a job at Cosmopolitan by going undercover to write an article about finding love in the business world. Lane has a checklist of attributes that her perfect man will have. Her search for the perfect man leads her on a long and funny journey of self discovery.In this role Hilary Duff returns to the type of comedy role that made her famous as Lizzie McGuire. There is a good mix of physical comedy and lovable character flaws that make this film fun to watch. All in all this a good clean comedy that's fun for everyone 13 & up.
1,Waste of time and money,Did not care for this movie at all! Boring and worthless plot! Wish I could get my time and money back!
4,A PG-13 Sex & The City,"Beauty & The Briefcase is a cute movie, not only that it's funny too. It has a few things that could use some work, but other than that it's a good movie. If you're looking for a good chick flick, this is an excellent choice. It has romance, humor, style and class. I didn't think I would like it that much, being a Duff fan, but it's a good movie."
5,Hilary Duff-Quintessential Woman,"I found this movie absolutely delightful! Ah who would not want to be in her shoes surrounded by elegantly dressed gentlemen who made good money in investment banking? I would and I have been in her shoes so I found it refreshing to reminisce on my days in investment banking! This movie is a keeper full of laughs, great clothes, delicious male eye candy and the beautiful backdrop of New York City; who could ask for more? Five well earned directing stars for Hilary Duff, she gets more beautiful and talented with time!"
2,Another Myth novel.,"The Myth series, like so many series are based on a particular theme. If you like the theme, you keep reading the new books as they are released. This book seemed to be very similar to the first book in the Myth series and therefore a little tedious"
1,The Groan Empire,"Let me offer a little advice to those of you considering buying this book: DON'T. I've wasted money and time that I will never get back. It is just about the worst Doctor Who novel in any series. The Doctor is portrayed as a ditzy shadow of himself who does pointless things simply for the heck of it. The visited planets were agonizing to read about. And to add insult to injury, there is a ""Marty-Stu"" (male ""Mary Sue"") character who inserts himself into the Doctor's party based on no merit other than existing and who becomes the ""narrator"" of the book, with little asides into his own uninteresting life story. By page 100, I gave up and just skimmed through the rest of the story; it wasn't worth it. Do yourself a favor and buy a different Eighth Doctor novel, like ""Anachrophobia"". Any one but this one."
3,Okay...,"I agree with comments from previous posts - the leather is quite thick and stiff and it is hard to fit a belt into the belt loop - both for the vertical and the horizontal ways that you're supposed to be able to carry this on your belt. It is actually virtually impossible to slip my usual leather belt for the horizontal position, despite my belt being only 1-1/8"" wide. Thankfully the vertical position is still possible. Most of the time, I'll probably just throw the whole sheath into my backpack, car, or toolbox, and I'll only wear it on my belt occasionally so it's not a HUGE deal, but just a minor annoyance. The big plus it has going for it is that it can also hold my Leatherman 42-bit set along with my knife so that I don't have to keep track of two separate sheaths/carrying cases."
4,Really happy with purchase,"I was able to find a helmet that matched my bike without spending a ton of money. It looks great and fits well. Quality is to be expected for the price that I paid.Thanks for the great feedback, it helped me decide on my purchase.A very happy customer,Dennis Sacramento CA"
4,Bell Solar Bike Helmet,"The helmet fits well and has the good adjustment dial in the back. It is light and should be plenty cool enough. Curiously, it appears to be very similar to the Giro Transfer helmet we bought at the same time for the spouse. Blue Bell for male, Red/Silver for female, even more curiously the helmets- when adjusted properly- fit us both equally well! The Bell was less expensive than the Giro, so that was my motivating factor. I am pleased with this purchase & Amazon as usual delivered as promised."
5,It fits!,"After many helmets that wobbled back and forth on my head, this helmet has a racketing device in the headliner to tighten up the fit. It stays where I put it and protects my head."
4,"Good Helmet, easy to adjust.","I commute by folding bike and this helmet. The weight is light, and it's easy to adjust. It's a unversial size product, you don't worry about to choose size when you buy it, Basiclly it fit for most people. And it's good looking."
5,Great helmet and value!,"I was looking for a helmet and came across a large array on the internet. As usual, Amazon helped me narrow it down to Bell. The Solar is light and sturdy. It has adjustable straps below the ears, chin strap and in the back of the helmet for a snug fit. When it's on during a ride you can feel plenty of air coming through as well. Can't miss with this."
4,Seems a Good Buy,"Bought it when helmet I was using was scraped along side from accident. Seems very similar to prior helmet, also from Bell, that was much more expensive. Pads seem a little thinner, that's all. Like that is cheaper, as that'll make me more likely to replace it if it is just minor damaged. I expect protection is as good as prior helmet. Retention system seems the same."
2,Broke on second use,"The price is right, but the dial-fit wheel started to slip, and wouldn't tighten properly the second time I used it. That part is very flimsy and not well-designed.The helmet has good cooling.Seems to leave way too much of the back of the head exposed. I understand that the pointy part in the back will keep your head from hitting the ground if you fall backwards. However, if something were to hit you in the lower part of the back of the head - such as a truck mirror for example - there would be nothing to stop it except that flimsy, hard dial-fit buckle.The chin strap fits uncomfortably, if you adjust it to hold the helmet securely. It really digs into that area where your jaw meets your neck. If you loosen it, then the helmet doesn't seem to be on securely.Looks too bulky on my head."
2,Without spare pads this has a short lifetime.,"Just bought this helmet to replace another whose pads had worn out after a year or two of use.I was surprised to see that Bell is not shipping these with a spare set of pads. Based on the short lifespan of these very thin pads, this helmet will end up in a landfill in a year or two. Once the pads wear a little the velcro starts to poke your skin, not fun.We're debating returning this helmet because of this."
2,"good fit, but awful buckle ruins the helmet","The universal fit mechanism works well and the helmet can be made nice and snug. The main drawback with this helmet is that the buckle/strap combination is horrible. I can't ride 15 miles without it becoming dangerously loose, necessitating constant correction. The straps seem too thick for the buckle adjustment slots, hence the slippage. Maybe this is not a problem if you ride 2-3 miles at a time, but it is a major inconvenience for longer rides. I regret this purchase, and would avoid other Bell helmets in this price range in the future."
1,Failed design backed by terrible customer service,"I purchased this light in march and used it for a couple of month until the light refused to stay attached to the mount. This is due to the idiotic design of having the light slide ""up"" onto the mount rather than ""down"" so that it slides off with the slightest bump. I contacted customer service in July to tell them I was having an issue and a very nice lady promised to send me a replacement light. Now, 2 month and 3 excuses later, I still do not have a light. This is a poorly designed product, with customer service which has not only failed to make things right, they have deceived me about their intentions to do so."
1,Not as advertised,This item is not as advertised. It is not an all white helmet. It has black on the inside and outside. I am very upset.
3,MacFonts 2,"I am an amateur to the world of mac /computers in general, so with that being said... I have chosen, ""Mac Fonts 2"" for my first review!!! I found the installation to be a little confusing and very time consuming. I was hoping to be able to install all fonts at once, instead of clicking on each individual font. The good news however, is that the"" Mac Fonts 2"" has 1000 fonts to choose from and a great variety for whatever the occasion may be. The quick reference guide provided with this software indicates that both true type,and open type fonts are available; the open type format is designed to work cross platform on macs and pc's, however, you must have compatible software. I give this software a 3 for moose rating."
5,Outstanding musically and goes to a good cause,"This cd is a must have for anyone that loves contemporary Christian music and/or wants money made from their purchase to go to a good cause.Musically the stand out track in my opinion is the opening one by dc Talk. The members of dc Talk have gotten together extremely rarely the past few years since splitting to do work on solo projects (hopefully not split for good) so anything new from them together as a band is highly anticipated. Their title track ""Let's Roll"" is unbelievable and better than anything off of their Supernatural cd.All the tracks on this cd are good in their own right and overall this cd is easily 5 stars. Buy this one with good conscience and enjoy the music which, sadly, Todd Beamer can no longer do."
3,A Good Collection,"I just recently ran across this album although it was done in 2002. It was done as a benefit for the Todd Beamer Foundation to benefit children affected by the 9/11 attacks.It caught my attention mainly because it had a song by dcTalk that I had not previously heard. As I love virtually all of their music, it seemed like a must buy. Ironically, while their song was pretty good, it is not one of the best ones on this CD.The two best songs are 'Light Of The World' which is done by Jennifer Knapp, Tobymac, and others along with 'I See You In His Eyes' by Nicole C. Mullen. Those two are great by any standard.This collection really has a diverse group of artists ranging from Wynonna to Yo-Yo Ma. Although not a great overall CD, there are some songs that definitely make it worthwhile."
4,pretty good,"This cd isn't great...but pretty good. For me, a big dc Talk fan, it was worth the money for me to purchase this cd just for the first 4 songs. I listened to the title track so many times that the purchase was probably worthwhile just for the one song! I really like Let's Roll. The cd after the first few songs, though, I'm not crazy about.Tracks 6, 13, 15, and 18 don't even have words--just soft music. 14 and 16 are both the Lord's Prayer, just to different music, both soft styles. The first 5 and numbers 7, 8, and 10-11 (which is really just one song) are basically the only ""contemporary"" Christian music with words. 9 is a country song.Good lyrics, but most of the cd is not as upbeat as I would like. 3 1/2 stars."
1,...,"Just another way for people to cash in on the tradgedy of September 11. Yes, I know the proceeds go to charity, but I think most people would be smarter to donate instead of buying this CD."
1,Pathetic,"The title track is a juvenile, inaccurate portrayal of the events of September 11, set to a melodic line stolen so many times over it has become trite.Good works are a nice thing, but let's be straight about this song: the ""writers"" sat down to pen an anthemic hit in the Bruce Springsteen vein, with a little Neil Young thrown in for flavoring. Good cause or not, there is no excuse for this kind of songwriting.Make a donation to the charity of your choice and ask nothing in return. You don't need this cd."
5,Essential Military Reading,"This book provides a comprehensive account of the United States Military from the birth of the country up to the present time.The text is easy to read, not like a 'stuffy' textbook, and it is well illustrated with photographs, maps and diagrams.Although intended as a school study book it provides a useful and informative reference book for anyone interested in the United States, and in particular their armed forces."
1,Not a Book.,This is not a book for reading. Its is a notebook/sketchbook with a beautiful Helmut Newton Cover
4,Where do you get these socks?,"My daughter is in 5th grade and is learning to stitch. She loves this book. Some of the creatures are beyond her ability but I think she will be creating from this book for many years to come. I just wish I could find the type, color and texture of the socks depicted in the book."
4,NEW LIFE FOR THE ODD ONES,"THIS BOOK SHOWS A GREAT WAY TO MAKE THOSE ODD SOCKS HAVE A NEW LIFE, YOU KNOW THE ONES THAT COME BACK FROM THE WASH EVEN THOUGH TWO WENT IN!! KIDS ALWAYS HAVE FAVOURITE SOCKS THAT THEY WONT PART WITH AND NOW THEY CAN KEEP THEM AS NEW PLAY MATES. GOOD VALUE."
3,interesting,"the book has cute designs, I thought there would be more, hence the reason he wrote book #2, which I probably won't buy"
2,Not for young kids!,"Don't be fooled; you may THINK ""sock creatures"" would be a nice family project, but the directions are extremely complicated, and there was no way my daughters, 5 and 7, could participate at all, except maybe choosing the socks! The diagrams are elaborate, and if you aren't already ""crafty"" they are tough to understand: five different stitches, complex patterns for cutting, etc. So if you have sewing experience and a lot of a certain kind of sock, knock yourself out, but don't even THINK about this kit as ""fun for the whole family!"""
1,Why does he SHOUT so much?!,"I didn't like the author's approach to marketing his book. Otherwise, it may be valuable."
5,The essence of martial science...,"Smith follows up volume one in this Wing Chun trilogy with another fine effort, this time detailing the techniques and tactics of the style. The material in this book can be used creatively as a guide to the applications of the forms described in volume one. This edition also contains an introduction to Chi Sau exercises, a vital component to Wing Chun training. What I like most about Smith is his open-minded perspective; in this book, he sights some of the strengths and weaknesses of the style, and he's not afraid to suggest solutions for oversights such as fighting outside trapping range and the lack of power strikes (readers might also consider a Wing Chun practitioner's vulnerability to a skilled wrestler's attack, an issue not addressed here). Another excellent analysis of this practical and highly efficient martial art."
1,"Please, buy another book",I don't know why I keep on buying this kind of manual and after having read this book I've got a good reason to stop. 70 pages of chatting that 'any master' can do. The pictures don't show what the written should want to explain. They don't have a dynamical sequence and it's difficult to realize the words' author. 1 star is enough.
1,simplistic and poorly illustrated,"I agree with the other 1 star reviewer in that this book very poorly illustrates proper technique and is very, very basic. Fortunately, I read it at the book store and therefore did not waste any money.When I found the book on Amazon while searching for other Wing Chun books, I was very surprised to see such good reviews for it. Of course, it could just be the author or friends of the author ;)Especially watch out for anybody who tries to tell you you can learn the martial arts from a book - you can not. You can learn about it, but without qualified instruction, you can't learn how to do it."
5,TOO GOOD FOR WORDS,"It's taken over 30 years to turn a native Tennessean into a bluegrass lover. Granted, I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I've been crazy about Ronnie Bowman's new CD Starting Over since I first heard the title cut on WNCW several months ago. I bought the CD within a week & I've played it nonstop. I've even taken the time to sit down on my couch and do nothing but listen to the CD - that's very unusual. I'm usually always doing something while listening to music. I can't tell you technical things that make this an awesome CD. All I know is that I love everything about this CD - the music, the lyrics & particularly Bowman's voice. I'm already on the Sugar Hill website looking for opportunities to catch Ronnie Bowman in concert. Looks good for this summer."
5,TOO GOOD FOR WORDS,"It's taken over 30 years to turn a native Tennessean into a bluegrass lover. Now I'm no expert, but I've been listening to it all - the old and the new - and I know what I like. I have been absolutely crazy about Ronnie Bowman's Starting Over CD since hearing the title cut on WNCW a few months ago. I bought the CD within a week and have been playing it nonstop. I even sat down on my couch one day and did nothing but listen to the whole CD. That's very unusual - normally I'm doing things while listening to music. I can't tell you the technical things that make this an awesome CD. I just love the music, lyrics and Bowman's voice. Can't wait to catch him in concert!!"
4,Hey this really does help,"Obviously if you are going to buy this CD you play tennis. Alot of tennis.It does help with visualization and match play, relaxation etc. I was skeptical when I first listened to it, but it grows on you.If you put some of his ideas into practice you really do relax on the court."
3,Wilton Armetale Flutes and Pearls Butter Dish,"I am a big fan of Wilton Armetale. This dish looks good, however a glass liner would make it more conveniente for cleaning purposes and easier to use."
5,An American in Italy,"I'm an American living in Italy, on Sicily. I enjoyed this book; Tim Parks nicely describes Italians doing what they naturally do. Italy is a prosperous country where most things seem to go awry. The chapter DISCRETO, VALIDO, RELATIVO sums it all up. Even the things that are worth doing (valido), and done well (discreto) have a fatal, RELATIVE flaw that cancels the first two. This paradox comes so naturally to natives that it must seem odd to Italians that foreigners need an explanation.THE ITALIANS, by Luigi Barzini, also tries to explain why Italians are the (wonderful) way they are."
4,"Good, easy reading book",I bought this book on the advice of my Italian language instructor and have enjoyed it. It seems to be an accurate description of what it's like to live in the northern area of Italy.My daughter recently moved to the area and from what I have experienced while there this year Mr. Parks writes accurately of the local culture and special ways of the people. And he writes to include the humorous daily events and quirks of the inhabitants of his little condo building.It's not a travel guide type of book but does provide an intersting look into the daily lives of the village and surrounding towns. I enjoyed the book and plan on sending it to my American daughter living above the village of Montecchio noted in the book.
1,Depressing,"This book was depressing. Maybe the author has a secret and doesn't want us to come and ruin his part of the world?! Who knows!I plan on emigrating to Italy, Tim Parks sure made it seem like it's a bad idea.I think he may be a pessimist (a funny pessimist-non the less). Of course there are many pitfalls when moving to a country (area) such as this- and it's important to know before you go.I guess this book is my mistake for continuing to read...all the way through.... This depressing book."
3,Too similar to other books,"I think I've over-dosed on the ""Briton living abroad"" sub-genre of the memoir. The flow of the text seemed to get stuck so often when Parks would go out of his way to point out how different he found Italian culture. I found it quite tiresome after awhile."
3,compared to the previous Album,"This is a great CD, but comparing it to the first Album that they came out with, this is not as good. I would rate the first album 5 star--this one, not as good; therefore, I gave it 3 stars."
1,The star goes for the best,"I give this compilation a star because I only like the Flight To Paradise by NOVAMENCO. The rest of the artists on this album sound like they copy others.I recommand Gipsy Kings, NovaMenco, Paco De Lucia, Ketama.You can find these artists on amazon.com"
5,"AC to 12VDC, 1.5 Amp Power Supply works great.","After purchasing the E-Flite Blade CP Pro electric helicopter kit from a local hobby store, I discovered that the kit does not include an AC/DC power supply. The helicopter kit does include the battery recharger, which can be supplied by either an AC/DC power supply, or a 12V battery source via it's attached alligator clips.If you purchased the same Blade CP Pro kit as I did, then I recommend purchasing this E-Flite AC/DC power supply accessory as it will allow you to recharge your helicopter's rechargeable battery from a standard AC outlet. I have not had any problems with this power supply."
1,EFlite Power Supply 12vDC 1.5A,This power supply did not work with intended battery. Even testing with a multimeter the power supply did not provide the amps as described in its own label. Recommendation is to stick with a car battery charger.
3,Less would be more,"I got a lot of good information out of this book, and I'm glad I bought it. The problem I have with it is the same problem I have with a lot of computer books. IT'S TOO LONG!!! There's way too much text in that book, and wading through it to get to the good stuff was tedious. The author did a good job of completely covering the topic, and he offers a lot of useful information about gathering, documenting and utilizing software requirements. Maybe for the next version, they'll get someone to edit the manuscript for extraneous content."
5,A very Good Book to understand Software Requirements,"This is an excellent book to understand Software Requirements, especially if you are new to Software Development. There are many views on ""best practices"" in the software industry, but Wieger's views are a good start.If you starting into Software Product/Project Management, new to Software Development, getting into stuff like writing an SRS or a Marketing Requirements Document, this book will give you a good analytical understanding of the multiple issues that you need to understand and keep in mind."
5,Bible of requirements,"Very practical book about requirements, from communication with customer to changing Your organization requirement elicitation process. Almost anything is thoroughly covered. Companion site includes numerous documents to get You started."
5,Best software requirements book I've ever read,"It is really the best software requirements book I've ever read. Pragmatic, concise, full of example and still exhaustive. It describes the main processes of Requirements Engineering (Requirements Developement and Requirements Management), plus a section dealing with imroving your own Requirements processes.I strongly raccomend this book to everyone interested in adopting a more efficent Requirements process."
4,"Comprehensive, clear and a little drab","The more time I spend running software projects, the more convinced I become that a strong requirements process is the hardest part.This is an excellent book that covers developing a strong requirements process. Wiegers doesn't cover underlying philosophy (see Kovitz or Jackson), but he provides a useful reference. The book outlines many good practices - and his point about ""good practices"" versus ""best practices"" is well taken, but it is not as well organized as some other toolbox-style books.A big part of establishing effective requirements gathering is selling the management team. This book doesn't really tackle this challenge.The sample project is helpful, but I wish Wiegers had gone the last mile and attached the project requirements documents as an appendix.Despite this list of gripes about what the book doesn't do, it has many, many good points and is written in a clear, if not lively, fashion. Recommended."
4,Good for setting up a Requirements Process,"I found this an easy to read and follow book which I rate highly for Business Analysts. Its best for senior Business Analysts or Team Leaders who want to set up a requirements and specification process to be used by the team or department(This is how I used it and found it very good).The best bits for me were the descriptions of prototyping (a great overview that cleared up my understanding) and how to run a Use-case workshop with business customers (essential stuff but never covered elsewhere).The worst bits were that I found the vision and scope template not very useful for internal company development and in Chapter 9, Section 4 I longed for an actual example of how to convert/translate use cases into specifications. The latter is one thing where an example would have clarified the text.Comparing this to Kovitz, I have Kovitz for my own personal development/tool as an analyst and this book for setting up a requirements plan/process and adminstering it."
5,I wanted to know,"My duaghter in law is dutch. I wanted to see their folk lore, what stories they tell to envolk their childrens imaginations."
2,Main seal died,"Didn't have this for very long before the main seal sprung a leak - it would be a great pump for the ergonomics, and when it worked, it flowed a ton of air, but sorry guys, I'll not be buying another planet bike pump again."
2,Same Old Story,"This pump is the same as all the others: it works great for a few hundred pump-ups, then it kicks the bucket. After awhile it wouldn't pump more than 60psi, and the dial wouldn't register correctly. The ""smart valve"" was pretty stupid in my opinion, since it wouldn't pump a presta valve if there wasn't already 10 psi in the tube.Would somebody PLEASE make a floor pump that lasts?!"
2,Didn't seem to work,"This disk has tiny, tiny little brushes on it. It didn't seem to do anything for my DVD player."
1,Never Get These,"I bought 2 packs of these guitar strings. I do not know what the deal is, but the high E string broke twice within 6 sessions of playing and the G string broke once. I have never had such fragile flimsy strings. Going to send Gibson a message aobut this."

3,"Good Brush, Bad Clip","I've had this for about a month now and the brush itself seems to be of high quality. Unfortunately, as one reviewer noted, the clip is of poor quality and the brush came of the pole the first time I used it. I was able to use the clip from the old brush and it works fine. I would suggest looking elsewhere unless you have extra clips. Not a huge savings versus what I can get a new brush for at the pool store, especially after factoring in a 3-pack of clips.Update 2/12/2012 - This item has lasted a little over a year and the bristles have started breaking off too much to continue using it. To be fair it lasted about as long as the Hayward original that came with the pool. I did not purchase this item again."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Like every reviewer has said, the pin does not does it job well. I had to change it to my spare ones so that the brush will stay onto the pole. The clip that came on the brush tends to let the brush slip off the pole whenever heavy scrubbing is performed. Other than that it does its job. For the price, I can't complain."
3,eh nothing special,"the brissles are a little wimpy, clear, doubt they will stand up to the suns uv well. just ok. metal looks a little rough after a few months of use."
2,Needs improvement,What can go wrong with a pool brush? Glad you asked. The plastic tension piece in the brush that is supposed to hold it in the pole is not nearly strong enough to hold it in place. One twist or bump while brushing and you may see your brush drop to the bottom of your pool!!
3,Doesn't fit standard pool pole,"This brush is OK, but it doesn't fit a standard pool pole. The attachment piece is too narrow and constantly fell off in the bottom of the pool until I replaced the plastic push pins with a nut and bolt."
1,Disgust.,"I FOUND A TYPO IN THIS BOOK. I AM FURIOUS!!! HOW CAN I TRUST THIS INFORMATION IF THERE IS INCORRECT GRAMMAR?? No one buy this ugly book. If you care to reference this hideous error, please refer to page 76. ""2000 tons of dired opium WAS""???????? WERE!! I will never be able to read anything ever again. grrr angst!"
1,Not worth the money,This product is of very poor quality and not worth the money when you add shipping costs.
1,Not worth the money,"This DVD is not worth the cost. The information is very limited. Was not very helpful to who is an experience film makerLooking for the business assistant such as contracts,invoice etc. Waste of money"
4,Cold air,"When i got this air conditioner I was also under the impression that it did not need any ventilation. Although it makes sense after i thought about it. I find that the unit does a wonderful job. It cools a 450Sq basement without a problem. The two problems i find is that hose is too short and the lack of a remote. I am still waiting to see what the energy bill will be,I expect it to be low."
1,not really portable - beware,"This product is advertised as being portable, but it must be attached to a window vent to work. So it's not portable. When I called to complain, the customer support supervisor would not give me contact information for higher management. She wanted my name and contact information instead.Buyers should also know that Amana is now owned by Haier, which is owned in part by the government of the People's Republic of China."
4,Excellent for teaching,"I teach A&P to massage students and we have just finished four months from this book. It is thorough and readable. Not perfect, but I haven't found anything better."
5,This is a MUST have book,"This book is way better than I thought it would be. The way things are explained throughout the book makes it so much easier to understand the actions of muscles. Even describes how to palpate the muscles on a partner. What to look for and what it should feel like. The variety of pictures helps too. The DVD was exceptional. Showing an overlay of the muscles on the person he's palpating really helped to ""see"" the muscles. And he did a fantastic job explaining step by step how to locate, palpate and engage the muscles. Definitely helped me out in school. I wish I ordered it sooner! I highly recommend the workbook and flashcards too. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Great and professional,I really appreciated their service very professional really recommended. If anyone looking for this book recommended to ordered from here.
3,"Good, But not as good as his other two albums","this Album is quality Bluegrass banjo picking but compared to his other two, in particular Hide Head Blues, its not so great."
5,Great bluegrass essential,Wonderfully done. Very powerful playing and the song selection is great. I just wish there had been more. I look forward to when Jim Mills puts out another CD. I like his banjo picking and his guitar playing isn't too bad either.
3,"Not quite Wills.....Chris Gilmartin, OD","This manual is definitely worth the money, however if I were forced to choose, I'd take the Wills Eye Manual. Some of the sections seem poorly organized and information can be hard to find. As another poster stated, the photos are excellent in quality. Not a bad choice for OD or ophthalmology residents, but I'd compare both before you buy if you are limited to one or the other.Chris Gilmartin, OD"
5,new edition just as good,I had the first edition when I was in school and got this newer edition for up to date info. It's just as good and organized in much the same way.
5,A thorough review,"I wanted to compare this book with the Wills Eye Manual. I think that this book is better than Wills in a few way, the first way being that it is more comprehensive and discusses topics that are not in Wills such as fistulas and many other eye disease that are missed by Wills. I still think Wills is more concise and an easier review however. Wills also has more current treatment options so I think owning them both is a good idea."
4,Cleaned my car cd player,Used it to clean my car cd player. Had to run it over several times but the player had never been cleaned and I expected as much. Now the player is AOK.
3,Don't really know,"We have a CD player that was not working. I thought cleaning the lens might get it working again. Using this product did not solve my problem, but I cannot say if it did clean the lens or not because the CD player is still not working. The problem could be something else and the CD player now has a clean lens."
1,Didn't Operate Properly,My CD player in my car kept rejecting this cleaner cd with an error message. I returned it for a refund.
1,It did not clean my DVD player,It says on the package that will clean lenses for both dvd and cd players. After running it three times the dvds on my dvd player still freezing scenes. It may work great for cd's.
1,Doesn't work period.,Tried this on our 2004 Toyota Highlander. The CD player wouldn't even read the disk. Tried several times. Don't waste your money.
4,Seems to work I like it!,I purchased item for my PC/laptop/boombox/DVD player.Just for maintenance to keep eye lens clear of any dirt/dust after using it on all of 3-5 items their was a coat of dust/dirt on disc.WOW what a surprise I try to keep my electronics clean & dust free every 2-3 months but dust/dirt seem to find it's way inside electronics.
2,cd player cleaner,Can't say it doesn't work when other people had sucess with it. But it didn't make my cd player work. Might have something else wrong with it.
1,It Sucks,After using it in my CD player it wouldnt even finish cleaning it. So therefore its not playing other CDS. I would not invest my money if I were you.
5,Fun,Love it!! Works well. Insulated very well. I never feel any heat through it when I am pulling stuff out if the oven.
5,Cool in the Kitchen,"Ok, so oven mitts themselves aren't that exciting. But this is more like a moose puppet that happens to be heat resistant. I cook and love wildlife, so I find it cute and entertaining."
3,Dumb looking,"I don't know what I expected but I am a bit disappointed in this item. Instead of a funny gift, it's a bit pathetic."
4,Really good ceiling fan,"I was looking for a modern, brushed nickel ceiling fan with remote control. This is quite acceptable.As other reviewers have mentioned, it does make some noise at highest speed but is silent at all lower speeds. I don't use the highest speed and all is fine.The product description does not indicate that both the remote and wall switch are included, only the wall switch. I ordered the remote separately and had to return it."
4,POISE Panty Culottes,"This is a really good product. It has made my mom's life much easier. Now if we could just get the cost of these products to be more reasonable so people can afford it, that would be great."
5,pants,pose pants work well. are comfortable and not detected and do the job. And the sizing is good.
5,From cotton field to convention floor.,"In 1962 when Fannie Lou Hamer raised her hand and volunteered to register blacks to vote in Mississippi, she saw it as the only way for poor, black sharcroppers to change their lives. But in 1962, white politicians in Mississippi were not about to let that happen. Harassment, loss of jobs, arrests, and beatings followed any attempts by blacks to register. In this well written account, the author gives young readers the straightforward, succinct story of Fannie Lou Hamer's role in the Civil Rights struggle and the incredible bravery of the men and women who made it succeed. A must read."
3,"Work, but difficult","My beaters had broken in an old hand-me-down mixer. Found these online and matched my mixer, so purchased them. They fit, just are hard to get to lock. Once I used them, they were extremely difficult to get out of the mixer. Maybe over time this will get easier. At least it was a lot cheaper than buying a new mixer!"
5,Change the World,"Thom Hartmann is trying to change the world one book at a time, one ADDer child at a time and one adult ADDer at a time. He's right though, ADD is just another way of looking at the world and 200 years ago it was probably more of a benefit than anything else. Kids didn't sit in schools all day; they were out working and becoming apprenticed. The world has changed and some of us have minds that have not yet adapted to the change and therefore we are seen as outcasts and therefore we have problems and therefore we need medication etc... The thing is, ADDers suffer and it's mostly from an educational system that is too standard and a society that is unforgiving. Thom's theories are great, he needs a book that transcends just those with ADD and ADHD, but reaches out to society - a book anyone will read and benefit from. Great read with great insights!One Boy's Struggle: A Memoir: Surviving Life with Undiagnosed ADD"
5,This Book Gave Me Ammunition,"I often felt like I was fighting without ammunition for help for our son in meetings with his teachers and school psychologist. They were advising us to steer him toward vocational training because he did not handle acedemic settings well. It was upon getting a good diagnosis of the extent of his ADD, and upon reading this book, that we were able to explain ADD in a positive way to him (age 13). From that day on, his attitude changed about life and his potential to enjoy life. Today, he is a Junior in college, working with children at both his church and at the local YMCA. He is a Hunter who has learned to help the Farmers in this world. That will always make him a valued team member in communities that must deal with Hunters who don't know why they don't fit in."
2,Balderdash!,"I don't believe I've ever read anything so clearly unscientific. The author is using his own strange new-age hypotheses to make a case for being ""hunters in a farmer's world""... it's preposterous. There are MANY many other books on the market about ADD and ADHD that are far superior to this one: Anything by Dr. Hallowell, Dr. Nadeau, or Dr. Amen. I was extremely disappointed with this book, as I don't consider myself a hunter or a farmer or any other stilted, inappropriate metaphor. It's time we stopped trying to label this as something other than what it is, and then work on coping mechanisms, and other forms of treatment. This book is the stuff quacks and crackpots are made of. It's awfully self-aggrandizing too. Don't waste your money or your time."
5,"Parents, this is the first book to read!","Is your child disabled by ADD? Damaged goods, limited potential? Absolutely not! Thom Hartmann explains that what some view as a disability, is a strength.Example - Is your child distractible, or in the alternative, able to quickly shift attention and multi-task? Hyper, or able to outwork and perseverve over others? Our ADD/HD children have exceptional strengths that surpass our 'normal' children. Thom Hartmann will help the parent and ADD adult recognize the hidden benefits of ADD and how to capitalize on them and view them, not as a disability to feared and overwhelmed by, but instead as a strength and positive trait.This is the first book I grab for my parents/clients.[...].This book will change your view of ADD, as it should!"
4,beautiful plant no blooms yet,"The plant came quickly and in good health, it is growning beautifully but no blooms yet. Could be not enough sun, will wait and see"
1,Plants Died,I bought the Bat Face Mexican Heather Plants and the plants died right after I planted them. I found some plants at Home Depot for $14.98 and 5 times larger. So I bought them.
4,showcase of genius,"I was hoping the book would deal with the filming and post-production aspects of the movie, but they're apparently saving that for a later book (that will only be written if this one sells!). This one is almost exclusively pre-production, but even that is well worth seeing. The Wachowskis went all-out on the script, including scene after scene that they had no idea how to film at the time. The storyboards had to brilliantly showcase the action, mood, and intensity of the story just to get the go-ahead from Warner Bros to commit such a large budget.It's depressing how most Oscar-winning movies are just a bunch of talking heads when you can page through this book and see such hard work and ingenuity in scene after scene. At least they got rich off it!"
3,Take the blue pill on this one,"Most ""art of"" movie books like star wars, lord of the rings, superman, ...the list goes on and on, have a lot of eye candy, great concept sketches, art, etc. You just don't get that here. The sketches have a lot of black and white comic book panels. Now, Wachowski bros are very into comics and saw this movie in that sense first and that made a great movie. It just doesn't make a great art of the matrix book.It's interesting to note that no art of the matrix reloaded or revolutions has come out."
2,Whare are the rest of the sketches?,"I have read some of the glowing reviews so I felt I had to write. If you don't own the ultimate matrix movie set and you haven't seen the glorious full color illustrations and sketches that brought these amazing movies to light, then you might love this book. It felt more like the story board or comic book Matrix but NOT the art. Many of the production illustrations, certainly the costume illustrations are left out of this book. Rarely have I seen a movie or movies have so much artwork created so I am baffled by this oversight. When I watched the making of disc dedicated to the illustrators and artists, I was shocked that the Brothers Wachowski would slight so much of their immensely talented team. And as much as I appreciated the script in the book, I would have traded it without hestitation for all the beautiful illustrations and sketches that were missing."
3,I expected more,"The art of this book is great, however I missed more photos of the real movie and also off-screen photos to make the work perfect, because the movie deserves. In spite of it, I recommend this book."
3,The Art Of The Matrix,"I'm gonna pretty much write the same kind of review that everyone else has been posting. It's cool to get ANY kind of book related to ""The Matrix"" to be published, but it pretty much is a whole book full of the story boards with about two cool pull outs of set designs. If your looking for a behind the scenes kind of book, it's poorly lacking. Yes, there are blurbs here and there that give a smidge of insight, but mostly just storyboards. I'm a freak for the movie, so I'll take anything. Also enjoyed that they printed the entire script, including the parts that were left out of the movie."
3,A fan club coffee table book,"It does make a nice coffee table book. It contains the storyboard and the screenplay with a smattering of artist comments on working with the directors, but it is a Matrix fan book, more than a filmmakers 'how-to make your film look like the Matrix' book."
4,A nice addition to the Art of titles library,"I was surprised at how thick this book is when it arrived. It's nicely published with good paperstock, nicely printed images and cloth/stitch binding. It feels like equal parts storyboard, script and conceptual artwork. If you are expecting a similar format like other Art of titles you may be disappointed as artistic medium (range of medium) is limited. If you read the reviews and understand what this book is then you are more likely to be happy."
5,Irresistible,This book is a piece of art by all means. It is also very tempting; you can't look at it without picking it up.The contents are great and so is the making of the book.I am really pleased to own such a book.
5,... and I will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.,Indeed this book gives very deep insight and should be of interest to anyone who looks for an answer to the question what the matrix is.
3,Disappointing Matrix: Mostly a Hardback Comic Book,"Impressive at first glance, it turns out that most of this weighty book is dominated by a ""storyboard"" that is little different than a comic book, albeit one dramatically penned in strong black and white. Whereas other ""Art of"" cinema books generally show the development of visual elements, this book feels disappointingly thin, for example, where are the pre-production ideas and sketches that were rejected, and why?Overall, The Art of the Matrix cashes in on The Matrix's popularity without providing the deep background that might satisfy film design fans. The original shooting script is included."
1,Not worth a dime.,"You get what you pay for. Only one out of 6-9 will fit if you're lucky and when you only have few minutes to join boards, you'll wish you had spent the extra cash and bought Lamello."
3,Lots of broken ones...,I must agree with a previous reviewer about there being quite a few defective biscuits. I picked up several containers at a local home center and took a good look at them. It was very easy to find them with chipped corrners or with cracks. The Freud biscuits that came with my cutter were much better in appearance. I'm not sure how it will ultimately affect the strength of the joint.
3,For Something That Makes Such A Strong Joint -,"- why so many broken and defective? Now when I go into Lowes and look at their cans I don't see any broken ones. Could it be the shipping method which Amazon uses to receive the items and the shipping method used to send to the customer? It seems that the Biscuits would spend as much time on a truck getting to a Lowes store. I don't know what it is. The biscuits are great and out of a hundred I will have 1 or 2 defects, ie too small (and no it's not my joints that are too big!). The biscuits will measure smaller. I am going to order a few of the 1000 boxes. Maybe the problem is with the plastic can."
1,Swolen biscuits cause problems,I've used biscuits for years. This shipment came pre-swolen. I rejected at least 30 percent of the biscuits because they were too thick. Porter Cable should have better quality control. I'm going to try a different brand.
3,Did I miss something?,"This one still has my mind working overtime. ""Mischief"" is not a bad read, but it left me with a lot of unanswered questions. I kept on reading because I was convinced that, somehow, everything would fall into place in the end. I was wrong. I simply didn't get it. It seems like the author had this fantastic idea for a novel and was unable to put things into words, leaving it to the reader to tie up the loose ends. It's almost like when my 8-year-old nephew is trying explain a new computer game to me, his words tumbling out of his mouth, and when I ask ""Why?"", ""Who is..."" and ""How come...?"" he smirks at me like he's saying ""What planet are YOU from?"". Like I said, this novel lacks some serious depth. It will keep you entertained, but don't expect too much."
2,to many questions unanswered,"He presented a multitude of interesting ideas. However, at the end your left wondering what one thing had to do with the other. He is probably a good writer . He just needs to remember that the reader has to see what he sees. If you don't tie everything together then you feel cheated that you read the book for nothing or wondering when part II comes out."
3,"Good, but Clegg has fallen in love with haunted houses...","and ghost stories. Clegg is a great writer and knows how to craft a story and deliver the usual chills and thrills. He is also adept at setting atmosphere and does this well in this particular book. Not much blood and gore here; it is much more subtle. But don't confuse subtle with complex; this is a quick fun read.However, like I mentioned before he is falling in love with ghost stories and haunted houses. The gore and violence factor that were found in abundance in his early work is not found here, not that it detracts from the story. I think he is just evolving as a writer and he no longer feels he needs the splatter.Final thoughts; a good novel with spooky atmosphere and chills and thrills, but not one of his better books by a long shot."
3,Another great tale from an underrated author,"Having read ""Halloween Man,"" i bought this one and enjoyed it. In ""Mischief,"" the reader is introduced to Jim Hook, a student at a New England prep school. Very eerily similar to ""Halloween Man"" Clegg uses the ""identity-conscious teen living in a shadowy town"" premise, but this time, the town is replaced by Harrow Academy. If I could point out a flaw in Mischief, it would be characterization--the reader is intorduced to secondary characters whom we either don't care about, is used briefly , serving no purpose to the story, or both(such as the Headmaster .) There was no use in reading the epilogue since it served no purpose nonewhatsoever. A big plus would be its pace-- I read this in two and a half weeks (a record for me since it takes me about a month to finish a novel.)"
2,A mess of a story,"This book was really two stories. One of them was sort of interesting -- a kid from the wrong side of the tracks attending a wealthy kids' boarding school, a secret society, a mysterious family secret... I was interested in this part, and would have happily read an entire book about those topics.The other story was a mess. Some sort of... haunting? Ghosts seeking revenge? Occult groups? None of it makes much sense, none of it is well-explained, and the ending is a cheap cop-out. I just read here that Mischief is actually the second of three books, but there's NOTHING on the front or back cover or inside the book to indicate such.I'm glad I paid less than a buck for this book, because it wasn't worth even that."
3,Haunted Houses...,"...or schools in this case. I bought this book after reading Douglas Clegg's prequel ""Nightmare House""(published by Cemetery Dance) which gives a good background for this story. ""Mischief"" is about a prestigious boys school known as ""Harrow"", that was once a house whose owner had a certain fascination with the occult. There is also a fraternity called ""The Cadavers"" whose initiation rites involves, among other equally palatable things, sleeping in crypts.This story is an easy read but certainly not one of the scariest I've read. However, there are some scary moments at the climax of the book and the characters are fairly believable. I will certainly be picking up his third in this series: ""The Infinite"""
2,Meandering and pointless,"This book reads more like a stream of consciousness than it does a well-written novel. It's comprised of a series of unusual events (none of which make much sense or are explained well) that are loosely tied together with a razor-thin plot. The characters are dull and their actions and motives make little sense. The plot itself is nearly non-existent and meanders from one point to another without focus. By the end of the book I didn't care one way or another about any of the characters, and didn't even understand what was going on. Everyone seemed to be a confused idiot wandering around in an alternate reality. Mischief could have been the very first draft of what later became a good novel, but should not have been published as is. Clegg can write when he wants to, but this book doesn't cut it. If you're a fan and want to give it a try anyway, be my guest. But if you've never read Clegg before, don't use this as your starting point."
4,Douglas Clegg does it again,"I've been a fan of Douglas Clegg since I first read Goat Dance, and I've never been disappointed with any of his works. Since the publication of his debut novel in 1989, he's been one of the few horror writers who never turned his back on the genre - and his books always deliver the goods. My personal favorites include his larger scope novels (Goat Dance, The Children's Hour, and You Come When I Call You are all excellent reads), and while somewhat shorter, Mischief is very satisfying read - a tight, fast-paced story that is compelling from the opening prologue to its conclusion. Harrow is a facsinating setting for this tale, and Clegg populates the novel with real, identifiable people. Don't be the last one on the block to discover this truly talented writer."
4,It's getting better all the time,"I found this in a cut out bin obviously no one knew what it was. this is a very uplifting cd with an almost american buegrassy edge at times and some classic ""sad"" sounding tunes as well. it's better than their other one. i like the use of dobro on some cuts. great cover art makes this the full package. Good tuneage."
5,Great book,This book was great!!!! It really surpassed my expectations. The book keeps you on your toes from start to finish and you could never possibly in your wildest dreams imagine what happens in the end. I own this book and I have read it 3 times. Great story!!!!!
2,The honey moon is over...,"It was great for 6 months... but please do not... I repeat... do not buy this television. This is a discontinued item. I brought this TV last November 2005 only had it for 6 months. And now it's been nothing but one big headache. This thing started making strange wining noises. And couldn't get any picture. At first they thought it was the lamp that needed replacing. Not!Still waiting to find out what's wrong with this thing. I know I probably got a defective television. But I wish I would had brought my 61 panasonic TV instead of this thing. Oh well, 2553 down the drain."
1,Can't replace color wheel w/o getting a new light engine ($$$1.5 - 2k),"I can't believe any retailer is still trying to sell this TV...it has problems that Sharp is already aware of...notice how they don't attempt to build/sell/service 56 inch screen DLPs anymore.Mine went out after 24 months. No warranty. Light engine was replaced by Sharp for free, b/c I got on the phone and pleaded a case that the part was more expensive than the TV. They said after this one time generosity, I'd be on my own. I thought that was fair. Kudos to Sharp for making it right.However, I thought it was my duty to inform you of the problem.BTW: The light engine is the millions mirrors, etc...it is dynamically built in w/ the color wheel. bad design. I think they learned from the problem and have started to build the TVs better.I bought an LG for my bedroom and a Toshiba for my bonus room. I've had better experiences w/ both. I hear Samsung is good too. Pick LCD."
1,Horrible TV! Do not buy!,"We purchased this TV in December of 2005 for about $2500. It was great for one year until it started making terrible noises and the picture stopped. Fortunately we bought a warranty, but it cost over $1800 to repair it (which the warranty covered). Within a year, the bulb burned out and this time the warranty wouldn't cover it. We would have had to invest another $5-600 again to make this repair. We tried contacting Sharp hoping to get some assistance since at this point, the repairs on the TV now almost exceeded the original cost of the set to begin with! Sharp refused to help. Please, please, please do not buy this TV!"
2,DONT BUY THIS TV,"DONT buy this hdtv, its a waste of your money. after about 6 months, the tv begins to hum very loud and its the most annoying thing in the world especially if your watching tv. to be completely honest, dont buy any rear projection of any kind. right now im looking to replace the sharp 56dr650 with a plasma or lcd tv mainly because they dont hum louder that the volume the tv is. iv had my 56dr650 for 18 months and they only way to replace the color wheel (the part that hums) it to buy another 56dr650 and take the color wheel out, so what the point in doing that. if you wanna save yoursELf some trouble, DONT BUY THIS HDTV"
5,great disc,"this record is the best record from this band or any other ever. listen to the madcap parody of the war in iraq on army brat. i saw these gusy in kansas city and they were the best live. the singer is a true believer and the drummer was the most talented i have seen ever, a real rock god. the singer was spitting fire and venom and the drummer was thunder and lightning. buy this record and stand in front of a mirror and try to sing like this guy then grab pots and pans and try to make the thunder of the drums. the guitarist is some one famous too. i met him and the drummer."
5,Excellent overview of an often complex history,"I recently ordered this book from Amazon. I had been looking for a more concise rather than lengthy explanation for many of the legal mechanisms and principles we enjoy (endure?) today. Without question, the ""History of the Common Law"" goes far to do just that. It is well organized and deftly written. I am reluctant to admit this about a history of law, but I confess that I found it hard to put down. Forty years after publication, the book remains a pillar and outstanding guide to our legal heritage"
5,Wonderful !,"Full of wisdom with beautiful photographs that are a treasure to the eyes and the words of wisdom are a treasure to the heart and soul . Every time I come across a book that is full of beauty and wisdom I want to give everyone in the world a copy to share it and this book is one of those books , not to discount the beauty and wisdom of all the other books I have read though for they are all equally of value . Like the author describes in his book about the seasons of our life >""Every Season Is Beautiful "" "" No one is more special than another so too are the seasons of our life each one is rich with beauty "" from the book.Thank you thank you thank you for this beautiful book it is a treasure and gift to our world ."
2,Not what I remembered - they have an off taste,"Years ago when I tried these, they were AWESOME. As another reviewer said, they tasted exactly like Butterfinger bars.WELL, NOT ANY MORE. :(I don't know what happened, but they have some off-taste to them that makes them almost inedible. The texture is still the same, and you can tell the taste is trying to be the same, but it's nowhere close. Unfortunately I cannot place the taste to give an idea.I am very sorry I purchased 8 boxes of these..."
5,Yummy! Delicious! Satisfying!,"Just when you think that all diet snack bars taste like sawdust, along comes Slim-Fast Optima Snack Bar, Peanut Butter Crunch. This crunchy, peanut-buttery bar is so delicious and packed with flavor that it satisfies even a hardcore candy lover. Very much recommended. Amazon's price is the best."
5,If yiou have a significant other - this one's for you!,"It's not really a typical ""feature film"" - it's more like a collection of short films or webisodes or episodes of a TV sitcom. Each segment is about the same couple but each one is a little story of its own. There are some cute things that sift across different segments, like why is the dog named ""Sylvester?"" If you want a thrill a minute, or if your idea of humor is guys getting hit in the crotch, this probably isn't for you. But if you like the everyday craziness of life with a significant other, you will love Eight Lessons"
1,wooden tube,"Maybe I don't know how to use a flute, or maybe this is defective, either way, the only sound I get is air. Disappointment for sure as it was intended for the flutist to march before American Revolutionary Soldiers returning from war. I needed something simple as in the 1700's style---One review mentioned good sounding instrument, so I bought it. ""When momma ain't happy....."""
2,No good for tiny arteries & terrible circulation,"This is just another example of a product recommended by know-it-all physicians. Never mind we're not all cut from the same cloth. For anyone with size 5 feet combined with tiny arteries which cause terrible circulation, these socks are just no good. I have terribly painful feet/arches, ankles, legs. These socks were somewhat constricting, and not only that, my feet felt like two blocks of coldness. I couldn't get them to warm up the way I sometimes can with other footwear. In fact, my black & white houndstooth nylon/spandex tights (bought at a closeout store for $2) are much more comfortable, so I plan on wearing those for the 10 hour plane flight. Now if only these planned-obsolescense houndstooth tights would have been planned-durability - that would have been nirvana."
2,They feel good but don't last,"These socks feel good, but they wear out very quickly. After only 5 or 6 wearings, mine were completely worn out in the heels (threadbare so that my heel poked through). I think such a pricey item should wear better."
2,For people with smaller calfs,I could not get these socks over my calfs. These are for people with pretty thin legs to begin with. I also purchased the Silver Core-spun by Therafirm and the Arrriva TraveTec socks and both of these are much more comfortable. They fit over my legs and have stayed up nicely.
1,NOT the William S. Burroughs recording.,"Note that this is NOT the William S. Burroughs recording of the same name. I had to give it one star in order to post this note. This note is not a review -- it's intended merely to supply information that Amazon refuses to provide, without which a shopper might be misled into mistakenly purchasing something unwanted."
5,A replacement for my mother's copy ..,"The original volume in our family had belonged to my mother, as a child. I passed it on down to our daughter, for our grandsons, only to discover that part of the pages were missing/torn out. But by that time, grandson Eli was hooked on the story ... and their was no soothing his curiosity ... so I found the same volume, published the same year, here on Amazon, in perfect condition! My daughter cut out the face plate, with my mother's childish entry, from the first book and pasted it into this one ... and EVERYONE is happy! Thank you, thank you!"
1,pseudo-history,"I am convinced that the ""reader from Ironwood, MI"" has little understanding of what makes good historical writing. Freeman's book is a quality work for the feeble-minded, but those who want real history should look elsewhere. Freeman's book is not only poorly documented, it is frequently dead wrong."
1,horrible,Anyone with above a fifth grade education will find this book elementary and pedantic. Do yourself a favor and save your money.
4,Lay This Body Down is a MUST read...,"Lay This Body Down is a great book and one which flows quickly and easily. I found myself having trouble putting the book down. Williams is the embodiment of the plantation farmer during the early 20s. Manning is used as a wonderful vehicle for the reader to see what it was like through a ""slave's"" eyes. I was able to place myself right next to Manning's side throughout the book and could feel the horror/terror that he felt. This is a must read for anyone who has any interest in the history of the south and the way blacks were treated well after slavery was abolished."
4,CityHippy loves this book,"In my quest to eat less meat books like these are crucial. Making vegetarianism mainstream gets easier with recipe books like this.Not Just For Vegetarians contains recipes you could serve to meat eaters. Recipes that might just make them realise that meat-free meals can tantalise, satisfy and impress.BUY THIS BOOK!For our full review visit our site."
1,Ethan Frome Review,"I just got done reading this book for school, and I must say that it was quite boring, and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone. I thought it was pretty boring, and the story line didn't keep me interested at all."
3,Yaardumian The Composer,I am biased since he is my Great Uncle. You have to appreciate this music to enjoy it. It is worth a listen too.
4,A much better book than I had expected,"An intimate portrait of a closely-knit family dealing with the specter of AIDS, ""Jodi: The Greatest Love Story Ever Told"" is a testament to the writer's wife and the love that she continues to show. Richard Brodsky was a successful architect with a loving family. Everything was going perfectly in his life, including successfully keeping his bisexual tendencies secret from his family, until he found out that he had AIDS. What follows is his struggle to tell his wife and his family about it as well as how they all work together to keep their family whole. It's hard to read through the book without feeling compassion for Richard and his family. A strongly moving book that portrays the strength of a family the way a family should be - compassionate, loving, forgiving, and whole. A recommended read."
3,NOT for CR-Vs,"The Amazon site lists this for multiple Honda models - this is NOT correct. It may be fine for Accords, but it is over 2 inches too long for a (2005) CR-V. Check out rockauto or call a parts store to be sure you are getting the correct part before ordering from Amazon! Otherwise, the Amazon price was competitive, they shipped quickly and they offered free shipping (at the time I ordered). The return policy was no hassle, as well"
2,"Incredibly gruesome, not recommended for recent survivors",I felt re-traumatized by the author's extremely graphic description of suicides over and over again. I would say this accounts for about 80% of the book. I don't understand the point of this and how it could help facilitate healing for anyone. Not helpful for me.
4,Help during a dark time,"12 years ago when a friend committed suicide, it was the only book I could find on the subject. It definitely helped me through, especially talking about the stigma attached to suicide and how friends and family don't know how to act.My only complaint was some of the stories she tells about suicide are a bit too graphic for my taste, but I would recommend the book. The listings of help and support in the back are helpful as well."
5,Carla Fine's book helped me realize I could survive.,"I read ""No Time To Say Goodbye"" in one day. I had a hard time putting it down partly because of Carla's wirting style and partly because she was able to make me realize life does go on, I'm not alone, and I will survive. My brother Michael killed himself March 4, 1998. I usually share books and don't worry about getting them back, but I know I'll reread this book and I couldn't bear to part with it. I told my mother and sister about it and they both ordered their own copies."
4,If you need to read this type of book. . .,"My counselor recommended this book as the best read for suicide surviviors. I'll take her word for it. Although it is not a hard read, it was a long read because I could only take so much at a time."
3,First read after the suicide,"I don't have a lot to compare this book to as it is the first I've read after my father's suicide. I was surprised to learn that there are so many survivors out there, I had no idea. The book brought forth many of my same feelings"
3,Real accounts by people who have been there,"I couldn't stop reading this book. I've found that when you are grieving it is very hard to concentrate on long-winded books and I liked the way this one flows. It moves easily from one story to another, with Carla Fine adding her own story along the way. Although this book doesn't really help by offering advice on how to cope it does show you that your grief is normal. My only critisims would be that it focuses a lot on dealing with social stigma, public sucides and the use of guns in many American sucides. Not having really faced any of these problems I felt quite removed from a great deal of the content."
4,Comforting information,"Being a recent survivor of the suicide of my son, I find myself reading every word I can find on the subject. With a lot of the books I have ordered, I have found myself overwhelmed with information that gave me statistics, histories, studies and a lot of numbers that do not comfort the ones left behind and did not really help my mental state. The author speaks very personally of her own battle as a suicide survivor and also speaks with survivors from all walks of life about all different family members, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, children and friends so there are a lot of perspectives. It was helpful. To a survivor of a recent suicide, that speaks volumes. I would recommend it to anyone struggling with the suicide of a loved one."
3,Buen estuche pero muy blando,"Es un estuche que sirve para tranportar grandes cantidades de herrajes y lo referente a parales y hierros de la bateria, pero es muy flojo, osea, es como un bolso NORMAL de ropa, solo que con unas ruedas mas toscas y rudas, si no tienes los suficientes herrajes o cosas que meterle al estuche los herrajes bailan mucho dentro de el, asi que se rayan y se estropean."
3,permanent seat?,"First off, I don't own this toilet. I was interested but wanted more info, especially about changing the seat. I found a number for Toto & talked to customer service. The person I talked to wasn't sure if this seat could be changed. She said some were permanent. Since I've never seen a seat last the life of a toilet, this was bad news to me. Well, after waiting on hold for quite a while for their tech support, I was cut off. I give up."
2,fluff,"i was disappointed with this book. i am a novice submissive, but there was nothing enlightening about this book. if you already have a decent understanding of submission, you might not waste your time. it's more for a vanilla woman who wants to throw a little kink into her love life. to be fair, i didn't read the whole thing, it didn't hold my interest."
3,Almost two books in one,"While this may be the only book out there for submissive women by a submissive woman, it isn't the best book for submissives. There are two books here really. The first looks at SM as a romantic experience where the focus is on the sexuality, especially of the woman. There is a lot of advice on what a woman can do to get herself into the mood and determine what works for her; not much advice on actually serving another person. The other book is scattered about and looks at SM as a means for heightened states of consciousness but without a lot of practical advice. Overall for men and women who see submission as an sexual exploration, it is a pretty good book. For anyone looking for advice on how to be submissive however, this book does not really address issues of service you may be looking for. The book is fairly different from her guide for dominant women but both books really focus on the needs and desires of the bottom partner and not on service."
3,Disappointed,"From the reviews available i was expecting something more than i got from this author. It was one of the few books available that was written by a submissive woman. While the book may be great for people just discovering they are submissive, there isn't much there for someone who is already actively exploring the lifestyle. One thing that was confusing for me, is that almost throughout the book, she gives advice that i intrepret as topping from the bottom. This is something my Master doesn't allow, as it undermines the entire basis of the relationship. There is virtually no information in it about service or what to do with the struggles that inevitably occur when the submissive must chose between embracing her submission or her vanilla thinking ."
1,Too Limited...Not Recommended,"I read this book, hoping it would be a good and indepth look at female submission within the sexual D/s context in general. What I got was what the author personally thought was arousing instead. Most of what she mentions in this book (ie. tips on what to do, wear, how to behave) isn't helpful and it must be realized that such things are highly individualistic. What works for one won't work for all.I also found the fantasies she mentions in this book of poor taste. I'm not one for racially ""Othering"" and ""exoticizing"" people and I resent that she does this in the book (I'm thinking of the Middle Eastern Man against ""milky white skin"" fantasies). This was written very much from the perspective of a particular white female submissive, and that's what you get, her limited (and unenlightened) perspective. Not helpful."
5,Best songs in a long time!,"I keep listening to the ""Fire in the Youth"" cd over and over again, and still can't get enough of the B-side Players. Their sound is tight and their message is righteous. Imagine: Bob Marley meets Manu Chao and invites Ozomatli to add a tasty sprinkling of Latin funk. The resulting sounds are delicious and on point. My personal favorites: ""Alegria"" for dancing, ""Nuestras Demandas"" for inspiration, and ""Pleasure and Pain"" for kicking back."
1,"Not inspiring, despite high aspirations","This multi-ethnic group hails from San Diego and has the valiant goal of bringing the cultural fusion of Mexican-American sounds in that city into the limelight. Their songs, in English and Spanish, are all about rights, independence, and non-violence - messages you can get behind. But the lyrics themselves are too predictable to really inspire. That's not to say the musicians aren't talented - they're just not good songwriters. For some music that will at least get your feet moving or hips shaking, try the more salsa-style tracks which emphasize musicianship over political message: El Comal (tk 4), Micaela (tk 7), and Taquerito (tk 10) all have a spicy latin edge and well worth a spin. Otherwise, you might try Unplug This Armageddon (tk 2) or Crossroads (tk 9), just don't expect them to bring about la revolución."
5,So Many Turns of Events!,"The Italian was Radcliffe's last novel. It is about a nobleman who falls in love with a woman whose identity is unknown to herself and the reader throughout her sufferings. She is oppressed by many people in whose hands she falls as she is snatched away from the nobleman Vivaldi to prevent their marriage. Like all of Radcliffe's heroines, her character is marked by an amazing fortitude despite the horrifying things to which she is frequently subjected. Vivaldi faces the powers of the Inquisition and Radcliffe gives the reader some idea of their dealings with offenders and their ways of making prisoners ""confess."" There are many turns of events which are delightful until another perilous event disappoints and grieves the reader. This is certainly what most reviewers call a page-turner. The sentiments are by no means modern. For a reader who is looking for modern unrestrained ""romance,"" none of Radcliffe's novels is a good choice. Her stories are for true romantics."
2,A Difficult Read,"I found ""The Italian"" to be less satisfying, more lurid, more obscure, and harder going than ""Romance of the Forest."" The plot moves slowly and the punctuation of this edition was a definite impediment for me. The decadent qualities, atmosphere of depravity, and character style were intentional, I realize, but I found this book to be mired in its genre, cardboard in character development, and unrewarding. I enjoyed the similar ""Uncle Silas"" far more."
4,"Not as useful as #20's, but still a great deal","For years I have been using P-C biscuits in my woodworking projects. Since I work with alot of 3/4"" - 5/4"" wood, I use #20 biscuits more than the smaller #10 and #00, but I have found that these #10 biscuits excell at reinforcing mitered corners.I have not had any significant amount of ""bad"" biscuits from Porter-Cable. There is an occasional thick one - meaning it either didn't get compressed as it should have or it swelled from moisture - but these are few and far between.Basically, I have had nothing but good luck with these so I highly recommend them!"
3,Not very effective,It probably slowed down my Corgi by all of about 2.2 seconds. She gets her pointy little nose right in between the knobs on the dish and still inhales the food.
3,Really needs rubber base ring,"The bowl does do what it's supposed to do for my Pug beast that would down a normal bowl of food in less than 60 seconds. The design of this bowl is great and increases the dog's eating time several fold, probably closer to 3 minutes to finish the same amount of food. The only thing that keeps me from going 4 or 5 stars is there's no rubber base ring to keep the bowl in place on floors and it get's shoved all about the place unless you put it on a high grip pad of rubber or some other tacky material. Otherwise does as it's supposed to do."
3,Great idea... but not for Pugs,"I'd actually give this 5 stars if I had a dog with a snout. It didn't seem to be as deep in the photos as it actually is. While it does slow him down, Hoops is unable to get to the last fourth of his meal and it looks like the pillars are almost poking his eyes.I tried it a couple of times with him. He got very frustrated and flipped it over the first time. I secured it the second time, so he just gave up with 1/4 of his food left and cried. If it was half as deep it'd be great...Make a version for snub-nosed dogs please!"
5,Best bowl for Boston Terrier with bad tummy!,"Sofia started barfing up her food every couple of days and then it kept getting worse... about every meal. She ate so fast, a bowl would be gone in under 30 seconds. We rushed her to the vet several times thinking she had some big issue. When all the tests came back normal, we narrowed it down to how fast she ate her food, never even chewing everything that went in her mouth.This bowl has slowed her eating to about 6 minutes or so. She hasn't had a problem since. GREAT ITEM. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
4,Great dish,My puppy just gulped her food down in rapid time. This bowl really slowed her down. It said small so I was surprised it was as big as it was. I would have liked one just a little smaller. It has really been a wonderful thing though to slow her down. She still does not chew her food and I put just a little in the bowl at a time. My vet told me about it and I am glad he did.
5,Great Product,"This product has truly made a difference in my dog's eating habits. She used to eat so fast that she would lose her breath. It was scary. Now, the bowl makes her have to ""work"" to get her food rather than vaccuum it up and she no longer has the breath issue. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,Worth the $$,This has definitely helped slow our puppy down and kept her from choking when gobbling her food so quick.
3,not good for toy breeds,"I have a 6 lb yorkie and she inhales her food. I purchased this bowl and it has helped a little. She still manages to inhale the food, but a tiny bit slower now, as she has to navigate around the 3 posts to get it. It would be better if they made an extra small size. Also, the bowl is very light and not slip resistant, so she pushed it all over the place."
3,Slowed dog down somewhat...,"I like the concept and do think it slowed my dog down a little bit. I am not crazy about the quality. The plastic is pretty thin and when I put it on my ceremic tile, it moves around a lot. I guess that could be considered another benefit to slowing the dog down since she has to move with the bowl. :-) However, my dog has some neck issues and I am not sure that is good for her."
4,Overall pretty good product,"This bowl does slow down the eating a great deal, but once they get used to it they are able to speed back up a little. Overall it does slow down the eating and is worth the purchase."
4,brake fast bowls,it works the brake dish slows both of my pets down but somewhat expensive tho but worth it Rose
4,Works Great,"We love this bowl for our 3 small dogs. They would hoover up the food, walk over to the carpet and vomit it all back out. That has not happened once since we bought these bowls.Yes the material is light plastic- but our dogs aren't chewers... yes the dogs push it around the floor when they are eating- but it makes meal time more interesting.For the price, it's a great deal and it 100% solves the problem."
5,Brakefast bowl really works,"I have tried many things to slow down my king charles vacuum cleaner, but this is the one that works best.Forget about placing the ball in the bowl or high bowls.When he's finished his dinner after using this bowl he doesn't look bloated like previously.Highly recommended."
1,HATE BRAKE-FAST DOG BOWLS....THEY SKID ALL OVER,I ORDERED TWO BRAKE-FAST DOG BOWLS IN MEDIUM IN BLUE.....PAID OVER $30.00 AND MY DOG CANNOT EAT FROM IT BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING ON THE BOTTOM TO KEEP IT FROM SLIPPING ALL OVER THE KITCHEN FLOOR......I WANT MY MONEY BACK OR TO BE SENT TWO BOWLS WITH SOMETHING ON THE BOTTOM TO KEEP IT FROM SKIDDING......THIS IS FRAUDULENT TO NOT PUT SOMETHING ON THE BOTTOM. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY...
1,Dog bowl,"My cat eats so fast that his food comes right back up, I thought he would use this bowl to slow himself down, but he won't eat out of it. This is not for cats."
4,"It works, but it needs a non-skid bottom.","This dish is just right for my mini dachshunds. It has slowed down their inhalation of their food and now they don't gag, wheeze or throw up after eating. My only complaint, and hence the 4 stars instead of 5, is that it needs a non skid bottom. For the price of this dish, it should have it."
5,Love this Dog Bowl!,"We LOVE this bowl. One of our dogs ate so fast she would almost choke. As soon as we started putting her food in this bowl, she had no choice but to slow down. Now, she eats a lot more relaxed."
2,questionable,The bowl is much bigger than I think it looks online.It allows for my pet to still eat too fast.I am not happy w/ this purchase
2,Not so Much,"The product itself is durable and I'm sure it will last. It slowed down my dogs eating at first, but after a few feedings he got used to the nubs and was eating just a quickly. I also bought another red bowl for my mothers dog, a fast eating chow hound shaped like a small football. The only way it slowed him down was that it took him longer to lick clean every nook and cranny. Perhaps if they made a size smaller? or bigger nubs? I don't know, but if given the option of a redo, I wouldn't buy them again."
3,dogs,"I guess it's alright. The dogs were confused for the first couple of days and ate more slowly but after a week they somehow managed to not really be slowed down at all. Eh, it was worth a shot."
1,The animal will starve...,"...if its face is flat. For my critter, I need a bowl where the pillars are half the size. The bowl is the right size, but the only way the critter could get food is to be like a frog and ""nab"" the kibble with its tongue. It was amusing to watch for 60 seconds, then I simply felt sorry for her. I gave it a few hours of a try, but had to go back to the other bowl where she gulps the food down. :("
1,My cat hates these bowls,"I adopted a new cat that was slightly overweight and needed to be put on a diet. Needless to say, everytime I put his food down, he acted like he hadn't been feed in weeks and proceeded to inhale it all within a matter of seconds. Bought these bowls to hopefully slow him down. All it did was stress him out. The bowl is too deep for a cat. He pushed the bowl all over the floor and finally started using his paws to pull the food out of the bowl onto the floor. Don't waste your money..........they do not work for cats."
2,Too Big for Small Dogs,I ordered this bowl for my 6.5 pound Yorkie and the bowl is bigger than it looks.The small size bowl is perfect for a medium sized dog.
2,Dog bowl too light,Our mininature poodle can easily push the bowl around. It should have a rubber base to help it grip hard floors and should be weighted down. If I would have seen the actual product I wouldn't have spent my money on it.
2,Too BIG!!,"My 5 pound full grown Maltese has absolutely no problem just sticking his snout between the pegs to eat his food. In conclusion, it did not help him slow down his eating ): I even left the bowl on the hardwood floor so it could ""slide around"" thus making it more difficult for him, but he hardly even moved it!I even made sure and checked the sticker on the bottom to make sure it was in fact the small bowl.I still use the bowl though, because I did pay for it."
4,"A good ""how to"" book",This book follows several artists and shows with good photos step by step through the process of making their style of figures. Of course they make it look easy and the level of skill required to make something similar is high but it does give you a good insight into the processes. Also shows photos of other artists works for inspiration.
2,I guess I'm not a fan of Jude Deveraux.....,"This is my first Jude Deveraux book. I found myself ""cringing"" throughout at what I found to be its ridiculous predictability. I love the concept of time travel and that's why I bought the book. However, try as I might, I could not immerse myself in this story. Granted, I tend to read mysteries, thrillers & historical fiction and not romance novels, so perhaps that is why I found it so disappointing. Nothing about this book is intriguing or new, and you see what is coming next a mile away. Even as a romance novel, I think it would be disappointing because the love story is so sappy, juvenile and unrealistic that it's embarrassing....or so I thought!"
3,Could have been so much more...,"This book started out with a lot of potential for being as good as A Knight In Shining Armor until the part where she introduces us to Talis & Callie. It ended up being a good portion of the book, but yet they never really got anywhere in their relationship. I felt like I was running (or in this case, reading) in place. It might just be the control freak in me, but I wanted to see them get more out of their relationship. I can't say too much more without giving the book away. All in all, this book is ok, but not filled with fulfilled romance."
5,Divine,"My favorite book by this author. I love the whole soulmate idea. In my not so humble opinion, this is J.D's best book that I've read. And to the first reviewer on this page, being together for your entire life, always being there for each other even during childhood is what being soulmates is all about."
3,Needed Further Development,"I really liked the idea of the past life regressions in a love story, but of the 3 different lives explored in the book, only one is really told in depth. This idea could have been developed further and you are cut off short by the abrupt ending. Very clever ideas, but the chain of events will catch you off guard. Just when you think you are about to read a historical romance about Edwardian England, you find out you're not. Clever but not her best."
3,ummmm. . . .*sighs*,"This book was heartwarming and well writen, but the author, as on many accasions, has put in two different stories into the same book, and it gets too confusing. I love the story of Talis and Callie, but the story should have been focused on just one of the plots, not all. If you have nothing to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I would suggest it, otherwise, just read the middle."
1,Hardest book I've ever forced myself to read...,"I am shocked at the reviews for this book. First I must say the childhood of Callie and Tallis was excellent. But unfortunately the book had a modern time beginning, then the childhood of Callie and Tallis, then back to modern. When the book went back to modern times at the end I was lost. I admit I had to sleep, and work, so I had put the book down for a day or two. What a mistake. I bet I read 20 pages of the last segment before I could remember what the beginning was. And this book did not warrant going back to the beginning to remember where the author had left off. I'm sorry Jude Deveraux, excellent idea, I looooveeee time travel books, but I definetely walked away from this book very disappointed. Some of the best books I have ever read have been by this author, unfortunately I will not be passing this book around."
4,An Enchanting Read,"Jude Devereaux's Remembrance was a wonderful story. Devereaux takes great pains to make the reader feel the emotions of the characters. Her plot development was fast but fully understandable. Remembrance reminds the reader that there truly is a ""soul mate"" for every person. It is definitely a classic work from the talented mind of Ms. Devereaux."
5,"J.D's BEST BOOK EVER, MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!!!!!!!!","After reading Remembrance, Jude Deverereux earned her place as my favorite Romance author. I recommend this book to anybody who is an avid romance reader. Jude uses three interweaving plots that keeps the book going and going. I couldn't put it down! Have the Kleenex handy though, it's a tear jerker!"
5,What an extraordinary story!,"The last time I cried this much from reading a novel was when I read JD's A Knight In Shining Armor.Like most have said, this is a story about soul mates/reincarnation, and it deals with three stories all, obviously, involving each other.It took me a bit of time to become captivated, but when I was, I was hooked. You won't need a bookmark because you won't be able to put it down, but you will need a box of tissues. Enjoy!"
2,Not very interesting,"This book had so many (unnecessary) twists and turns that it kept confusing me. And so many of those twists were SO not interesting. A story about a great love, where those in love are ready to believe the worst of the other, where there's no trust, where... I don't know, it just didn't cut it. It took me ages to read this book. I'm just happy I got it from the library."
3,Could've been sooo much better.....,"This was a good book. The story of Callie and Talis could've worked well on it's own. The ending was too brief. After everything Hayden went through in her past lives her present should've been more. I would've love to find out what happened after Tariz came back from his meeting to get her. Good book, but could've been alot better, IMO."
3,"Just too much death, blood, and sorrow for me...","I am torn by this book. I really wanted to love it, and for the most part, I did, but the plot is rather dark and depressing at times. These two lovers were destined to be together, but fate is doing everything it can to keep them apart. Between pride, misunderstandings, impotence, curses, and suicide they are doomed to never have a life of love together. Also, the circumstances regarding Callie and Talis's birth was very upsetting to me.If you can get through the dark parts of the book, the love story is very emotional and touching. Their love is truly a love that spans eternity. The ending is a little cheesy and unbelievable, but so are most of Ms. Deveraux's books.If you are a Jude Deveraux fan, then I would recommend this book. But, all in all, there are many better time travel books available (Diana Gabaldon, Dean Koontz, Nina Bangs).JBoguepaper-and-laceSpecializing in paranormal romance and fiction."
5,Love this book!!!,"This book took me to wonderful places in time. I loved it from the first page to the last. Time travel books are tricky to pull off successfully, but Ms. Deveraux was able to do it flawlessly."
3,Remembrance,"Incredible ending made up for the incredibly slow start. This was my tenth Deveraux, and I have loved every single book until this one, which was needlessly drawn out."
5,Lock yourself in with this book and throw the key away!!!!!!,"Besides 'A knight in shining armour', this is another great romance classic. I fell in love with this book even without a single member of the wonderfully big Montgomery family in the book itself. It made me laugh in the front, cry in the middle, and laugh and cry at the end. I read the book some time after the beginning of 1997, and up to now, I am still in a 'lovey-dovey' mood. I have re-read it tons of times and I look forward to any other books that challenge this fantastic story"
2,TEDIOUS,"The First two or three chapters of this book were OK but then the book just started to get boring. The parts about the main character's past lives are not well written. It's like reading a modern teenager's style of writing set in the middle ages. There were some parts that were written well but most were just not believable. I skipped most of the pages just to read the ending. The concept of the story is really good, but the book was just poorly written."
2,Definately not her best.,"The reader had to keep track of three diferent timelines. Jude took too much time writing about the time of Talis and Callasandra. Way too much time. And not enough time writing about the middle life after she found out about ""The Begining."""
3,"Love, love, love, love, love....","For those who have never experienced this sensation, this book might prove to be annoying. Why in the world is this woman looking for some gorgeous guy who's supposed to be meant for her? But the way Ms. Deveraux describes it, is actually quite beautiful, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. The reader will never get bored because she jumps from one place and time into another, so disconnected from the previous, and yet so completely logically attached to it... Yet the most beautiful thing about this book is the performer who reads it to you while you are either walking, jogging, or sitting on the train on your way to work with your eyes closed. J. Smith-Cameron proves that the performance is just as important, if not more so, than the content. She lives through every part becoming every character, making the listener visualize what exactly is going on. She receives 5 stars. And the book benefits."
1,Not the worst movie ever....but close!,"This is a joke...and not even a very good one. The movie takes place in California, where you can't even take a squat without reams of paperwork (if you'll excuse the pun.) Yet these clowns are selling stolen bikes to dealerships....yeah, right. The plot is shallow and stupid and makes ""The Hills Have Eyes"" look like Shakespeare by comparison. A sad commentary on the biker lifestyle by someone who is obviously completely clueless in regard to it. Harleys in your movie does not an ""Easy Rider"" make.Unfortunatly, I couldn't give less than one star. I would think that buying this movie for $1.00, and then paying for shipping would put it in the ripoff range. I watched a free copy, and still felt ripped off."
1,"This MOVIE WAS BAD,BAD BAD!!!!!!!","I,m a huge Bertie Higgins fan but this movie was a HIGH OCTANE TURD!! i guess it's a horror movie (of sorts!)but the acting is so bad you'd think you were watching a Who's the Boss episode.describing this movie would cause me to relive it in my head and i'm sorry i'm not willing to risk a headache that bad for anyone!just avoid this movie!"
3,"Clemmons, NC Fan","All I Know is that I like this CD. It is a little less country than Don't Count Us Out and it does not rock as much as Advanced Medication For the Blues. However, each song stands on its own. The words to each song are well crafted and each is well worth the listen. The CD starts with Sailor's Prayer that reminds you of Keith's time with Jimmy Buffett. He slows it down a bit with Baby Took a Limo to Memphis. Monkey River Town Girl is a little silly, but an enjoyable sign-along song. The title song,All I Know, is a great reflection on self and world peace and reminds us that we are all in this together. Long Monday will be on an upcoming John Prine CD. I think Keith's version will be the better of the two. I am very happy with my purchase of this CD, but I will admit that I preferred his two previous CDs over this one. I have never been disappointed with a Keith Sykes CD or concert and I think you will enjoy this one."
4,good book,"This used book fairly in good condition, some hightlingting. Thanks for the good delivery."
3,truck cover snaps,"snaps are non-metal, made of composite. the photo suggests a metal product. i doubt the snaps will last very long or stand up to heavy use (insertion/disconnect count)"
1,Almost Completely Useless,"This book was used as a text for an electro-optic devices class that I took. I can honestly say that the book was almost completely useless to me throughout the course. Topics are covered very poorly if at all and good explanations are few and far between. You would be much better off using other books, neighbor kids or indeed rubbing sand in your eyes rather than try to use this book."
1,DFD is not at his best singing in French,"I bought this album because I was looking for some of the more rare Ravel songs on it, such as the Don Quichotte songs, and Un Grand Sommeil Noir. That's the only reason YOU should buy it. DFD's lieder singing (in German) is well-known, for good reason, and highly commended by everyone. But in French he's not at his best. I also found it puzzling that he sings the Chansons Populaires all in French, since the languages they are written in are Italian, Spanish, French, and Hebrew. DFD does them all in French translations. For a better version try Cecilia Bartoli (for the Chansons Populaires), or Natalie Stutzman (Histoire Naturelle)."
5,This Is a Classic,"This album gives you about three seconds before getting to business. Their business is your pleasure, but it's the pleasure of poking repeatedly at the bruise you got from a girlfriend's bite. Oneida play with all the rock ruthlessness of a band like Lightning Bolt, but with the drawn-out (drone-out?) blissful serial composition of Steve Reich. It's better than that, though. Textures are rough but precise--a sheet of burlap lace. Instruments and equipment collapse, hyperventilate, sputter, and explode smoothly and intuitively. This is rock music! All your Town and Country discs will begin to smell like your grandma's living room. Play it loud and blow yourself up--this is about as good as it gets, friends."
3,unsettling noise,"Wow, this is some strange ""music"". it's good to torture somebody to. I don't reccomend it for the car or dinner parties though."
5,Pleasantly Dark and Alien,"I was mostly interested in this album due to its connection to (the now sadly defunct) COIL, but it proved itself a great album in its own right. Slightly dark and modestly moody, it's perfect music for a dreary winter day, especially if you enjoy casual suicidal ideation."
4,Consistent,Consistent size and density. A few rough edges here and there but for they do what they are supposed to do..
5,JOINER BISCUITS,The kind of quality you would expect from Porter Cable. The package enables you to see your available stock and keep them neat and separated.
4,I was drawn right in to the story,"I anticipated a romance novel, but the book was quite different. I found myself drawn right into the story, and overall, I enjoyed the read. I often look for new authors, and many of them are with smaller publishers. There are some typographical errors, but not a glaring number. Also, a few pages were printed incorrectly, but not to the point I couldn't read the content. Those problems reflect the publisher so I cannot be as harsh as some reviewers, but I have to say that I can't give 5 stars for these very reasons. I would enjoy reading more of this authors work."
1,After She's Gone,"I tried to find something, anything to like about this book but, I just couldn't. I just found my self disliking the male protagonist more and more with each page I read. I couldn't even muster up an ounce of compassion for him because he had lost his wife. This book should have been titled ""No Wonder She's Gone""."
1,Really bad first attempt at a book,"I was really disappointed in this book. It was the most poorly edited book and poorly written book I've ever read. An editor let this man get away with using a misspelled word to exclaim insight. Instead of saying ""Voila"" they actually printed it as ""Wallah."" Aargghh! Hurt my eyes to read it. The conversational style was very elementary and, well, dorky. Not cute, not fresh, dorky. I never did figure out what the main purpose or theme of the book was - was it his anguish over his wife's death, his fight against cancer, or teaching us all about the printing business? I think I'll throw this one away!"
3,A passable read,"I wasn't quite as enthralled by this story as the other reviewers. Maybe I'm just not a moist handkerchief type of person. Though I could empathise with the main character, I felt that some of the other characterizations fell short and this rather spoilt the effect.In its favour, the story itself is passable, plausible and well constructed. I have read worse, but I have read better."
3,Sort of limited,"Please see the Images I uploaded above. I show what a couple of the patterns look like and then a page showing one quarter of a design. See also a close-up of one of the designs as quilted. Perhaps my complaint is aesthetic: isn't it hard to make out the patterns of the quilt? Light peach over tan is hard to discern. The borders stand out more than the individual patterns do. I also think it's hard to use to use the stencils: getting which strip goes under or over the next strip is not easy to see. That said, the designs themselves are pretty and appear authentic."
3,Decent,"This book has some decent ideas for free things to do, but I wouldn't call it a treasure trove of ideas. The Weekend and Calendar sections of the LA Times has more interesting and current events without being overwhelming like the free weekly newspapers. I would recommend the book to long term visitors or people who have just moved to Los Angeles. For people who have been in the city longer, the LA Times is a better bet."
2,Save your money,"I find this book to be too far out of date to really be helpful, it has a 2004 copyright date. A lot happens in 7 years around a big city like LA. I tried looking up information on several of the given websites and couldn't find anything. I would save my money and look for something more current."
5,Fantastic Book for Great Ways to Spend Time in L.A. Without Emptying Your Pocket!,"I don't think most people realize how much fun can be had in LA without spending much money. This guide book, Free L.A. offers endless ideas that could fill a ton of time. I think it's especially helpful for families with kids, looking for new ways to spend time while providing a fun and educational experience. Whether you're interested in film, art, music, aquariums, nature. . . this book lists tons of possibilities. I really like the way the book is organized, making it super easy to find what you are interested in, and when in the year it's available. Great find!"
1,Perhaps we should pay and do other stuff!,"Very disappointed in this book. I think one could get more from a google of LA. Oh well, I guess I expected unusual stuff, given the title."
2,Dyna Disc goes flat,"The Dyna Disc I received had to be returned. When I attempted to put air in it, the air valve popped out and almost hit me in the eye. I couldn't get the valve back in so that it would stay. As a result, the Dyna Disc was useless. It's a great product if it's not defective."
2,Backpack,Decent enough. Does not handle very well when it is full. It does not stay stable on the wheels. Wants to flop from one wheel to the other instead of both wheels being firmly on the ground.
5,A Lenny White Classic....,This album is truly some of Lenny's best work. This is one of an array of albums showing Lenny at the peak of his creative powers in a very special time in jazz-fusion history. He truly takes his place as an icon of the jazz-fusion movement.
3,Galactic Fusion & Disco Party,"This album was released in 1978 when everybody, from Herbie Hancock to the Grateful Dead, was making their disco album. This album's two best songs, ""12 Bars From Mars"" and ""Night Games"", were not written by Lenny White but by other band members. They're fusion songs sounding much like Return To Forever. The intro to ""12 Bars"" has some martian sound effects. The songs written by Lenny White are worthwile, especially ""Pooh Bear"", another fusion song. ""Earthlings"" is the only worthwhile vocal track of three, mainly for its instrumental solos. ""Spazmo Strikes Again"" is a short tag to Earthlings. ""Lockie's Inspiration"" is an intro to the ballad ""I'll See You Soon"". ""Time"" is a good song for ""disco night""."
5,AMAZING,"this is an AMAZING book, u follow the homeworks, this book is an eye opener, geeezz thank you... highly recommended :-)"
2,TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!!!,"Anyone who dumps you clearly has no repect for you or their self. You must always communicate to see what the other person is thinking and feeling. When they don't communicate, they could possibly dump you. Pick up on the cues. The books says about the dumping language, but it is all pretty obvious. The person is being a coward!! If the person really loves you and wants to a least be your friend then the person will talk to you about what is right and wrong. You may have started a relationship with a serial dater/dumper, who is in denial about their problems, emotional issues and fears, and you didn't find out before hand.Don't control the person because that is exactly what the dumper is doing - controlling what happens in the relationship. Confront the person with their own thoughts and feelings by communicating. Love yourself, because that person clearly doesn't love their self. But, remember, still have some compassion for that person.Take care."
4,Helped me to understand what a friend was experiencing,I got a copy for a friend who was divorcing and another copy for myself so that I could understand the process better and be more helpful to her. This book was recommended to me by another friend who had divorced and I recommend it also.
5,"Very helpful, informative book","This is one of the first books that I buy for friends that are going through a divorce.My chapter of Parents Without Partners used this book for several years as our guide for the topics for our divorce/recovery support group. It was invaluable to me as a newcomer to the group and then later as one of the facilitators of the support group.It is very insightful & will explain the phases (building blocks) everyone goes through with divorce and recovery.It also helps you with coping skills that you can apply to more areas of your life than just divorce/recovery. I've found that the similar phases & rebuilding occur when you go through a job layoff, a death, or any other traumatic loss.I highly recommend this book."
5,You can't move on to a healthy relationship until you go through Bruce's building blocks!,"I am a facilitator of a divorce support group in our area and we have been using Dr. Bruce Fisher's (third edition) ""Rebuilding"" to help adults move through the painful steps of beginning again. For anyone who has experienced the pangs of divorce this is a MUST read! We have seen lives transformed in our groups. It's tough but you can heal and you can move on to wonderful relationships. But you must work through those building blocks... this is an excellent tool for healing from divorce or any broken relationship."
3,Take your time,Rebuilding post relationship or post anything major is a step by step process that can't be rushed. This book shows the natural processes everybody goes through as well as decisions and lifestyle matters that can get one to the promised land.
4,it helps,I'm not finished with this book.. but I like it.. I see that others felt the same way I felt when my wife left me for another man.. And the divorce has anything but civil.. It has been some hard times.. but after reading this I understand that life will be far better now..
3,Not a fan,"Just went through a divorce. This book was not helpful to me. It was way too repetetive but not helpful in what they were saying. I have a doctorate degree, and I still found this book a little confusing. I read about 10 pages and haven't touched it since. The building block diagram is cute and all, but I don't agree with everything and how it was presented.Save your money and go out to eat with friends and laugh."
2,advertising their workshop classes mainly...,"They claim after reading the book or attending their divorce seminars you must feel like you have climbed the mountain of growth. That can't happend so easy. It hurts towards the end of the book when they make you feel like you are expected to have accomplished some major breakthroughs if you did the tests at the end of chapters. I wish it was so easy Mr. Bruce.The book might be worht reading, but beware of those rip off seminars."
5,Immediate Help on the Way!,"I felt as if the therapist was in the room, knew me well and validated my pain and concerns. He presented helpful hints, problem solving techniques and validated that divorce while painful has an 'up side'. I would recommend this to anyone who is in the process of divorce or who has been through the process and feels unsettled with making sense of this painful life-changing event.I also think it is valuable for someone who has been through a painful breakup with a boyfriend or girlfriend. This is a summary but so helpful I am purchasing the book."
5,Rebuilding When Your Relationship Ends,"I first read this book when it was newly published many years ago. It literally gave me a 'roadmap' of where to go through a confusing web of conflicting emotions. I think that it is most useful doing the first year after a relationship breakup, although I did refer to it many times subsequently. Since then, I have given away numerous copies to troubled and unhappy people. Time, of course, is the best healer, but this book is a great support to anyone on that journey. Bruce Fisher and his wife came to Australia and NZ years ago to give workshops which were very useful to lots of people. If you are prepared to do'the hard work' you will find it a very useful book."
5,Outstanding for the dumpees of the world,"This book gives excellent, practical advice for toiling through 19 stages of recovery in a divorce. Each chapter is unique, and gives homework for the person to work through topics like anger, loneliness, grieving, etc. I found the chapter on dumper/dumpee relationships (grief vs. guilt) and the chapter on love to be the most valuable. Fisher describes many types of love, and allows a confused person to sort out where they and their spouse actually stood with each other, both during and after a marriage. Unravelling confusion is important to anybody going through a divorce. I cannot more strongly recommend this book to anybody who has been dumped by their spouse. Buy it, keep it, and go back to it many times over the months you may be trying to ""climb your mountain""."
5,Without doubt the most life changing book I have ever read,"Without doubt the most life changing book I have ever read! If you only read one book on how to recover from separation then this is THE one.Other really good ones for me were:Freeing the Angry MindThe Happiness TrapMom's House, Dad's House"
4,Rebuilding (after divorce) - book review,"Good book to help you get grounded and understand the feelings you are going through, if this is your first time in this situation."
5,Very Insightful,"This book helped me tremendously while in in the midst of the divorce process. It dealt very thoroughly, and accurately, with the range of emotions I was experiencing. It helped to know that others have had the same emotions and gave me hope that I will be able to succeed at starting over. It also covers relationship issues that may be useful in healing a troubled marriage, or to prevent similar mistakes in a new relationship."
4,No-run panty hose?,"I have two small boys and have had great difficulty finding a pair of hose that are not one wear and done. These,so far, have made it through several wash and wears. The down side is that it's not control top."
3,Between Fair and Good,"These 3 cd's were an abridgment. Had I known, I would not have ordered it. I've enjoyed several of Robinson's books. However, this shorten version left way too many holes. By the way, I was not pleased that Amazon failed to note the abridgment! Oh yeah, let me state my displeasure one more time. Then again, a few more grumbles might make me feel better!"
2,Literary Heroin....,"I have read the entire 7th. Carrier serries, and this review covers all of them. Mr. Albano's history is not alway on the money, but for those psycotic military history afficianados out there, this serries was addictive. Interesting concept, I would love to hear from the author someday."
4,"Interesting fiction, let's get more of this!!!!","Very sorry, that it is out of stock, I would like to read it!!!!! Reprint it as soon as possible.I'll keep waiting!!!"
4,The classic backgammon book,"This was the book I learned backgammon with in the 1970s. It doesn't have modern 1990s theory but still provides solid all-around advice on a variety of topics. The book's strengths are its discussions of probabilities, back games, late positions, and unusual plays. There is also a long history of the game and a lot of discussion of chouettes and other variations. The modern expert might not agree with the opening moves or the doubling theory, but all in all there's plenty there for newcomers to learn."
4,"Not too bad, considering it is Hitchens","Recently, we have had some insight into the personality of Mr. Hitchens, including an account in the New Yorker of what it is like to attend a meeting with him. Unfortunately, he has proven to Katha Pollitt that he is anti-women (and thus anti-minorities), and so we must regard Hitchens as an enemy to progressive politics. However, he has a great deal of interest to say about his birth nation, and I find it curious that his own brother is a conservative journalist. There are many revelations in this book, and I can recommend it to anyone interested in the man behind the torrent of journalism (some of it published in conservative publications) that continues week after week."
5,A MUST for any engineer/scientist working on drying!,"This book is ""a must"" for both academic and industrial workers with anything to do with drying! Hard to find a better bargain price for a technical hardcover book with rich quality printing."
3,Valuable and resource book for drying community,"This essentially lays out how important Drying and associated aspects are to the humanity; the industries, engineering, academics, research and various clientelle. Clearly presented with illustrations. A true guide to all those involved with ""Drying""."
4,A first-in-a-series fantasy,"Fern Drudger's family is extremely boring. They are nothing like Fern. After twelve years of living with her dull family, Fern discovers that she and a boy named Howard Bone were switched at birth. When the adults decide that Fern and Howard should spend a summer with their birth parents, Fern is whisked away by her father, the Bone. Not knowing what to make of him, Fern learns that he is an ""Anybody."" He can change into someone or something else at any time. But, he's not very good at it and he's convinced that Fern can help him. Readers, who enjoy Harry Potter or Lemony Snicket, should enjoy this first-in-a-series. The pen sketches sprinkled throughout add just a bit more flavor to this already clever tale. With both humor and real-life family drama along with a little mystery, this fantasy will prove to be a quick and entertaining read for all."
5,transforming,"The theme of this book (and its excellent sequels the Nobodies and the Somebodies) is that nothing is what it seems and that everything can change. This is such a powerful message for kids, who tend to look at the world so literally and so in the present. Very unusual. Very well-written. Great read."
5,The Final Countdown,This is for your information. The Final Countdown was authored by Martin Caidin.
5,Tense and nasty horror,"It's difficult to describe the appeal of this book. It would be naive to deny that at some level, Johnson titillates by drawing heavily on the scenarios of bondage pornography. And yet he simultaneously undermines that titillation by deconstructing any fantasy elements in favour of the likely reality of the main character's growing discomfort and claustrophobia. The resultant impression is tense and highly unsettling. Further distanced from more lurid genres by Johnson's unsensational literate style, this detailed study of the character dynamics of collective evil is an under-rated classic of horror. (Mendal Johnson, incidentally, died in 1976 and never finished any other novels)."
5,EXCELLENT,"Finally there is a breakdance dvd where the moves are actually explained on how to really do them! This dvd makes it fun and easy to learn. If you really want to learn how to breakdance, this is the one and only dvd to buy. Puts all others to shame and I've seen many!"
2,So Small,"I did not like the book b/c of its size. It's so small, I really didn't anticipate that a book on the Sears Tower would be about the size of my hand. I'm not sure if in the description it had said the size of this book but either way I'm disappointed."
1,An Injustice To The Best,Most of the information in this book is and has been published before. Bobby Orr did not support the writing of this book. His life as the greatest hockey player in history is not depicted by this author.
4,"""Searching"" is a very worthwhile read","This book looks not only at the brilliant but tragically short career of Bobby Orr, but also at the historical development of Canadian hockey and the NHL, and the significant changes at the time of Orr's career. I consider it mandatory reading for any passionate hockey fan."
2,"""Superficial Account of an Enigmatic Superstar""","In the course of researching this book, author Stephen Brunt was not able to talk to Orr or any of his close knit circle of friends and family. As a result, Brunt's account is superficial and, ultimately, disappointing and unsatisfying. Orr has hinted that he might tell his story himself some day but I won't hold my breath. I suspect he will remain a secretive, introverted man, someone who plied his trade for too short a time, then bowed out with dignity. There's really nothing new in SEARCHING FOR BOBBY ORR and, as much as I like and respect Mr. Brunt, he has done little to disspell the mystery surrounding Number 4...and perhaps that's for the best."
1,does not hold charge after several uses,This battery worked fine for the first five or so of charges but quickly degraded to the level when it suffice for a just a few shot. This is really low quality product that will fail you when you expect it to work.
1,Battery failed after 3 weeks,"I expected this to be too good to be true, given the price. It was. Battery only worked for one full charge. Then wouldn't recharge."
3,ok deal,have purchased different brands of aftermarket batteries/ some last longer than others... for the price they are ok but I purchase several to be sure I get some decent ones.
4,A helpful guide,"I find it difficult to rate any one book on glassware since as any glass collector knows, one would literally have to have an entire library dedicated to antique glass only.As far as this book goes I found it to have a good bit of information on many areas of Fenton glass, some of which I was seeking and some I was not aware of. Overall,it is a good general guide, but as I said previously one would need a roomful of books to cover not only glass in general but indeed an entire section of said library would have to be just for Fenton glass. That being said I can recommend this book for beginners and casual collectors, as for the serious and professional types I think a collection of Fenton books should accompany your collection of Fenton glass."
2,"As with most guides, tends to be a bit inflated","Be careful with these price guides - they tend to be over inflated. There's a lot of placed on the web you can get price information from. use this guide to determine piece names, more than prices. Google yourantiqueroadshow they give free appraisals and it's more accurate. This book: For researching pieces, thumbs up, for prices, thumbs down."
5,Warman's Fenton Glass Identification and Price Guide,Great Book - Found 4 of 4 Fenton pieces in this book -- All completely difference - Thanks - Wish all book were like this one
3,Gift,I bought this as a gift for a friend who runs a consignment shop and she loves it and uses it as a reference frequently.
5,Great help to our business!,I work at a consignment store and this book is of great help in identifying antique glass wares.
5,Great Shower Experience,"This is a great shower head. It is high quality material, not cheap metal colored plastic like most shower heads you find in the store these days."
5,What I have been looking for,"This is an excellent product. The parts are made from heavy material. The shower head shut off valves shut off with no drips. All of the threads and fittings are standard so there is no problem using a different shower head on one side if you want to, I used one of those rain heads for one side.All in all a well made product. A little more pricier than others maybe but you are getting what you pay for."
5,Beautiful Byzantine,"I love this bracelet, it matches a byzantine necklace that I had purchased previously on Amazon some years ago, it is sturdy and I have to take it off sense receiving it. It was sent in a timely manner and the service was great."
3,did the job,"The tool did its job and it did it pretty well. However, I bent it slightly. That's quite the accomplishment since I'm not the strongest person out there. Jsut be careful with it."
2,Tub drain wrench by Superior Tools,"I just got this yesterday. I have a bath tub drain that I would like to replace. It has no center cross pieces. It just plain did not work. It was too small for the drain and just goes right through it. I tried using a rubber like wrap around it. I cleaned the drain, removed all the crud and scale but it still would not grab the drain. I would not recommend this tool. If you have cross pieces in your drain it should work but not without them. I was very disappointed."
5,Worked for me,"I used this wrench to remove a tub drain that was looking corroded. Although it fit just right and I had a socket wrench in the top for leverage, I was having trouble getting the wrench to move at all.I solved this problem by placing the wrench in the freezer for 20 minutes, then letting it set in the tub drain for 10 minutes to 'shrink' the drain. After that, I was able to slowly unscrew the drain with this wrench and my socket wrench (with extension) in the top.The nice thing about this wrench is that it gives you both sizes. I had to use the other end (smaller end in my case) when putting in my new drain.Since then, I have seen this same item at Lowes Home Improvement; however, Amazon has a lower price."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"First off, the wrench did enable me to remove the tub drain. I inserted a 3/8"" ratchet into the end of the tub wrench and applied modest, REPEAT, MODEST pressure. The ratchet twisted inside the tool. Why? The tool is a casting of some relatively soft metal. Undaunted, I used a pipe wrench to turn the tub wrench and the tub drain was easily removed with no further damage to the tub wrench. Bottom line, the tool works okay for a one or two-time home job but I would not recommend it for use by a professional."
2,broke the tool,"I bought the tool to help remove a stuck tub drain (obviously). I broke the tool, and never did unstick the drain. I was fooled a little bit by the photos of this product. As of 9/10/2012, there are two photos of this product, one in packaging and one out of packaging. A close inspection reveals that these are two separate designs of the same general product. In one, the central hexagonal part of the tool looks like solid material (other than the two holes through the middle. In the photo of the packaged version, the central hexagonal part of the tool is webbed. The webbed version is the one I received. These webs are of an exceptionally low quality, and they busted right off the tool without much pressure under a crescent wrench. I'm not a strong person, but this isn't a strong tool, either...If I was buying this tool again, I would buy a different brand name - one where the central hexagonal portion was solid material rather than webbed."
1,"DO NOT BUY - CHEAP CAST METAL, WHICH BREAKS EASY","Got this at Lowes today. Put it in the drain and without very much torque, one of the teeth on the tool broke off. It is made of cheap pot metal - some cheap cast aluminum - really junky for something like this. Should be steel. Not ready to write off the ""Made in USA"" company yet and returned this for another, which is steel and has the curved teeth almost like a transmission gear. Put it in the drain, tap with a hammer and then use a 1/2 drive ratchet or breaker bar to remove the drain - those ""teeth"" will bite into the drain ""trumpet"" and will not slip. I didn't try it yet, but am about to, but do not buy this cheap junk tool listed here."
2,Snapped in two on first use.,"The cast metal drain tool did not stand up to its first application. The shaft of the tool broke when I was attempting to remove a 40+ year old bath tub drain. I was applying torque with a half inch drive ratchet wrench with a less than ten inch long handle. I would have expected the ratchet mechanism or the drain cross bars to break before the drain wrench would break, but that did not happen. Perhaps there was a defect in the casting..."
2,Doesn't work if the crossbars are missing,The description is misleading as it says works on drains with broken crossbars. Not true. It's too small to get a grip on it. It will just spin in the drain while turning.
3,It will probably break...but it's cheap,"TIP: Use a large adjustable crescent wrench on the middle of the tool for best results.I bought this to remove two tubs from my house. The first tub was a rusted pain. I tried to use a squeezable wrench on the top of the tool but one of the teeth broke off (very soft metal). I was annoyed so I took a large crescent wrench and adjusted it to the middle section of the tool. After a good hard push, it came loose. I took this knowledge to the second tub and it worked the first time. Would I recommend this tool? Sure, since it's cheap. Just don't expect it to last for multiple tub removals."
3,Worked well after a date with a bench grinder,"Boiling Water. Someone mentioned that in another review to loosen the old putty. I think it helped. Anyway, my broken tub drain measured 1.503"" ID with my trusty calipers, so I figured I was good to go. The large end wouldn't even start in the hole. *snap!* After my 4th trip to the bench grinder, I had it knocked down enough that I got it in about 3/8"" deep and got it to bite without spinning. I used a 1/2"" drive breaker for that, but ( the drain was 20 years old ) it came out without much fight. Used a 3/8"" drive ratchet to install the new one, and did it twice, because attention needs paid to how hard you torque it and it displacing the new putty. It's not a lug nut on a 2500 Chevy truck. If the wrench would have fit the hole, I would give it 5 stars, but there are DIYers out there I imagine that might not have the tools to grind the OD down properly, so I nicked it. My 0.02"
3,Broke two of them before giving up,"I won't give it one star since my tub drain is likely unusually stuck (1940s tub... not sure if the drain has been around since then but it's possible), but two of these broke on me using normal strength (i.e., not a hammer or lever or anything) to a socket wrench. One snapped at the center, the other's teeth broke off. It did seem like it would work better than the kind just shaped like a tuning fork. That kind said it could withstand 300 in-lb of torque and to the credit of this one I was putting way more than that on it (~10 in long socket wrench x probably 150 lb of force since I was pulling pretty darn hard = ~1500 in-lbs) so this is still better for unstuck drains."
5,Excellent tool.,"It's great that it fits 3/8"" ratchet drive and 1/2"". Other tools like this require the metal rod that goes through the middle and then you spin it. That would be a pain. With this you simply insert your ratchet and get the drain in or out. It nearly guarantees that you won't bust the old drain when you are removing it.It's a nearly insignificant tool, until you need it. And if you do need a drain wrench this is certainly a good choice."
1,This is absurd,"This book was published in 1956. Poul Anderson died in 2008. You are charging $9.95 for the book and a bad copy to boot. Shame on you.If there are problems with converting some of these old books to ebooks try using volunteers. Some of us would be willing to give some time to the process just to see some of these older books available again. Many have been out of print for years. Take a page from the music CD people. It's great to be able to find old Fats Waller, Billy Holiday etc. again.Gary R."
1,Poor quality Kindle format,The kindle version of this book is readable but of lower quality than standard kindle books. There are extra spaces in the middle of words and occasionally no spaces between other words.At the start of the book there are some pages with odd symbols and a few images of the actual pages. The book is readable but I found these problems distracting.I have read other kindle books from this wonder ebook series but have never experienced these problems.
2,Not for the light hearted,"I read the reviews on this movie and decided to purchase it for my family. We are a hockey family, so it made sense to buy this based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately, the initial half hour of content was incredibly INTENSE for my young audience (7 & 9) as they were horrified to see burning American Flags and not understanding the context of the political events being portrayed. By the time the hockey action started, the movie had totally lost their interest.It seems the filmmakers tried to mimic how the New Headlines played out in the background of ""Miracle."" Only, in this film, it is presented center stage and overshadows the love of the game."
4,Entertaining,"A very entertaining family-friendly hockey movie based off of a true story. Also, sends a great message of doing what's right, perseverance, and tolerance."
5,Great family movie,"This was a great family movie! My children are 9, 7 and 4 and we all loved it. Great story line."
4,Cute hockey movie,We watched this video on a drive to one of my Squirt-level son's out-of-town hockey tournaments. It was a nice family friendly movie with a good message.
2,You can't be serious,"Had to be an art critic! You've seen 'em. Pompous, full of baloney! Ditto artist or poet!In this case, you can judge the book by its cover. Someone give me a bucket.If a novelist chooses to make sexuality his theme, he better be ready. Berger was not, may never be. This appears to be written by a sophomore in high school. Maybe college.Huge disappointment."
1,Wher is my book?,"It's been a long time since I had purchased the book ""G"" by John Berger, and I haven't got it yet!!!! Where is my book?"
3,What's really in this dvd,"The length of this DVD is about 25-30 minutes. I was a bit disappointed with what they presented--just several examples of how to make tessellations. The host and person who showed how to make tessellations sounded very wooden, so if you're showing this to students they will get bored quickly.The only good thing about this were examples of the kind of artwork you can do with tessellations.Personally, you're better off searching online for how to do different tessellations."
2,Former Student of Dean Cogan,I believe I speak for many of Dean Cogan's former constitutional law students. Dean Cogan used his constitutional law students as lab rats while writing his book and over half of the students dropped out of his class. The few remaining students were forced to re-learn constitutional law while taking their Bar Review class!
2,a bit of a crackpot,"Let's face it. Szasz is a bit of a crackpot. He has a political and libertarian agenda that was original when he first came out but after he sided the right-to-lifers over the Terri Schiavo fiasco, and threw the full weight of his whole argument behind such dubious positions, his arguments are now, for me, tarnished. It's okay to have an agenda, but state it and don't politicize it and make it a polemic. In other words he needs to be scientific and straightforward in making much of his arguments. I'm all for a subversive questioning of the status quo and the pscyhiatric 'industry' is under seige by such as Szasz, and from within, but don't dismiss all psychiatrists as hoaxes and pill-pushers.Gretchen Robinson, chaplain"
1,Do Not Waste Your $$$$,"I would think, that the fact that this movie was put to DVD it should have been cleaned up.The entire movie was dark to the point where Pele cannot be recognised other than a dark outline.There are a few parts in daylight yet the movie is dark.Good old movie, horrible DVDDo not waste you $$$$ you WILL be disappointed.!!!!"
2,HOT Shot DVD,"The quality with converting VHS to DVD is poor. It's too bad, because this is such a great movie, but it's hard to enjoy it with poor visibility."
3,The Missing Sunrise,"The Missing Sunrise was about a girl named Alexandra visiting her friend Gretchen in Meadowmount. She gets a anonymous letter saying she shouldn't go there, mysterious things start occuring and she feels scared in this house!"
5,Will be giving this book to many people!,I highly recommend this craft book. My children and I used it for Christmas gifts and family members loved them. I am a Girl Scout leader and will be using it for my troop. This is one of the better craft books I've ever seen.Thank you!Sherry Linn
2,did not work well,the unit did not work when I travled out of the country... waste of money. I expected a quality product from Belkin but did not get what I expected.
4,A Great Product!,"This is such a great product because it includes 220V to 110V AC converter, phone adapters for major European countries, and includes a custom vinyl compact carrying case. The Belkin F8E067 European Power/Phone Converter Pack is realy great if you live in Eurip."
5,this set should be celebrated,"first, amazon.com messed up the listing-- it's not just the winds of the Bavarian Radio Sym, but the strings, brass, percussion--the whole orchestra. And you can hear every section of it, not because of recording-studio tricks but because Kubelik had a great ear and musical mind, and a deep feeling for Brahms. He savors the dissonances and counterpoint (you never ""can't hear"" the bass, for example) while at the same time keeping a natural forward flow, so that the metrical relations and emotional surges come through. This is one of the great Brahms sets, Worth making the special order!"
4,Great comb and OK brush,"The comb has a really nice feel, easy to handle and goes through the hair nicely. The brush is good, soft and has a small handle with rubber grips on either side, but I found it a little too small to be completely comfortable to use. It's as if the baby were going to be brushing his own hair. But it does work and for the price, I think it's a good choice."
2,Charming peaceful conquest,"Argentinian President Sarmiento sent this soldier, L.V. Mansilla (1831-1913), son of an important General, as a chief of the border against the Indians in Río Cuarto, southwards of Córdoba in 1869. The events he lived in those days made this book, first published in 1877. He's got a gift for narrative and he describes, mixing anecdotes and witty sentences, his peaceful task in Indian land. Two monks, four officers and a group of soldiers went with him. This book achieved a prize in the International Geographical Congress in Paris."
4,Poor battery life,"This phone is a great buy. It has very good reception and very helpful features. The only problem (it looks like is the same for every Panasonic phone) is the battery. The charge is supposed to last 7 hours of talking time and in the reality it last 4, 5 hours standing-by."
3,Great sound quality but missing some features,"This phone has very good voice quality, both input and output. The design is quite attractive and pretty easy to use, fairly intuitive.Problem is, a lot of simple features are missing. For example, there is no list of recently dialed calls. Also, the caller ID will often simply state ""call from out of area""---wtf??? Unless that's my phone company's fault (Qwest) but I tend to doubt that. It doesn't let you rename the different handsets either, for some reason.All in all I would give this 4 stars but for the price, it really should be better in terms of features, hence 3 stars. I will probably return this unit and go back to Uniden, which has far better bang for the buck."
2,Is It Working?,"I can't tell if it is really working. I think my dog barks alittle less. I still have to go out there because she is barking and yell at her and the other dogs around us are barking as well. Is it less? Maybe? Maybe a little less. Sure was not worth $80.00, but I was desperate for a solution. I have had it for about three or four weeks now."
1,Don't be stupid like me and buy this piece of junk,"WOW! I must really be desperate to buy something like this. The premise behind this electronic piece of garbage is that it ""calms the savage beast"" with it's soothing ultrasonic music. Kind of like that Bugs Bunny cartoon in which Bugs hypnotizes a crazed gorilla with a violin. I have no way of knowing if this thing actually produces a ultrasonic tone, it might just be a empty shell, it has the same effect. Nothing. Nadda. Zero."
4,A Great bed,"I Just bought this for my small dog ( A mini doxie) and he loves it...it seems so comfy and he loved it right away. He is always cold and i'm always hot so i keep the house cool. This was the perfect solution. And as always amazon has the Best price around, petco had this for 50 on sale and originaly 70, so i will be buying a second one here. I Wouldn't recomend this for for a dog who really would chew or rip up their bedding alot, it does not seem constructed to withstand that sort of use to me. There was also some wood chips inside of it? I'm not sure if this is supposed to be something dogs like or something?? In any case He loves it and that is enough to sell me!"
2,Ok,I thought this heated bed was for outdoor and indoor use. When I got it the directtions said strickly for indoor use only. So it was not what I wanted. My dog is 8 1/2 pounds and the bed is just right for him. He seem to really like it. The pad does get really hot for a dog bed. I worry about fire danger from it it.
5,Warm coveralls,"Bought them for my husband for Christmas, he loves them. Says they're really comfortable and warm."
5,Just Like I Remember!,I have recently been looking for this Cruet in our local grocery stores to no avail. My Mom had one when I was a kid and I decided that I wanted one. I forgot how much I loved Good Seasons Italian Dressing until my friend served it during a party. It truly is the best tasting dressing! I absolutely LOVE IT!
3,Good,"I expected the brilliance of Magic's Pawn to be woven into Magic's Promise. Unfortunately, I didn't get what I was seeking for. Instead, the book was more akin to ""Murder she Wrote"" or playing a whimsical game of ""Clue"". Admittedly, I found the book more of the mystery genre than of the fantasy."
4,Magic's Promise book,Keep up the good work Mercedes. I'll follow all your books of fantasy to see where it take me and others.
5,Magic's Promise,Wonderful book. A great read. Van's story will keep you on the edge of your seat. Everyone should read this book
2,Great concept,I love the themes and ideas behind the Last Herald Mage series. Unfortunately the quality of writing lets down the great potential of this book. This isn't surprising considering that Lackey was producing on average 4-5 publications a year when the Last Herald Mage series was written. Magic's Price was somewhat painful to get through but was required to fill in the gaps between the first and third volumes of the series. I recommend reading this novel purely for its themes and concepts. Don't expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat...
2,Quite a Disappointment (compared to the first part),"If you are expecting the same reading and emotional experience as in the first part (Magic's Pawn) - forget it right from the start. As in the first part Vanyel learned how to be a lover, in this part we can encounter him more often in a role of a father or a patron. So no heartbreaking Romeo&Juliet-like tragedy lovestory is going to happen - which was the reason I was buying the book and the reason why I was so disappointed when I finished it."
5,Excellent as Always,"As always, Mercedes Lackey's trilogies continue with vim and vigor in the second book. Great read, awesome characters, excellent storyline. The book was in great shape, just as promised."
5,I LOVE this book,"The second in Mercedes Lackey's ""The Last Herald-Mage"" trilogy, this book is part of my all-time favorite trilogy on earth. This book is amazing, though not my favorite of the trilogy (that goes to ""Magic's Pawn""), and it is definitely a worthy sequel. Buy this if you read gay OR fantasy fiction, because it is absolutely worth it."
3,magic's promise,"This volume continues the trilogy of Herald Mage Vanyel Ashkevron. He returns after an exhausting Border stint dealing with all sorts of unfriendly magic creatures to find a letter waiting for him from his father, who wants him to pay a visit. Naturally, magic is involved, including a demon, various nodes of supernatural power, and a young man who may or may not have killed his family (by magic).The only thing that didn't ring true for me were the reconcilaition between Jervis, the armsmaster and Vanyel. Suddenly, a man who's always been shown to be a brutal bully is dissolving and apologizing and incidentally shown not to have any prejudice against gays (which Vanyel is). Ditto the previously stern and foreboding father suddenly happy to mend any old wounds. The forgiveness happened way too fast to be believable."
3,Not as Promising,"""Magic's Promise"" suffers from a problem common to many trilogies-it carries on from the first part,and at the same time it's all in anticipation of the grand finale.In ""Magic's Promise"",Vanyel is sent to solve a royal murder mystery. It's pretty conventional,and surprisingly cliched for Mercedes Lackey. Mercedes Lackey is unaccustomed to writing mystery stories;it shows especially in this installment.However,""Magic's Promise"" does have promise. Vanyel struggles with the loss of his lover,Tylendel,as well as his feelings of attraction towards a young,teenaged prince. His banter with his Companion,Yfandes,shows the deep bond between them. Vanyel's relationship with his family is also developed as they come to terms with his homosexuality. ""Magic's Promise"" leaves the reader wanting more,and Lackey delivers."
3,Good photos - not such a good title,"The title 'Classic Steam Trains of the South' is something of a misnomer. It should, I think, be 'Classic Steam Trains of the Southern Railroad', as this is by far the major emphasis of its content. If any prospective purchaser is expecting a reasonable spectrum of steam operations across a number of well-known southern roads, as I was, then they will be disappointed. The bulk of photos focus on mainly Southern RR supplemented by a fair smattering of C&O. Very little attention is given to L&N, for example, ACL or SAL. Really quite a good volume for SRR enthusiasts, but not such a good buy if you expected some really good shots of steam operations of the other key railroads which serviced the region."
3,Unique,This worked on the hard floor surfaces and wall/baseboards but has not worked on the carpet. The odor may be too far down for the Unique to completely satuarate and actaully work. Pulling out the carpet and putting down linoleum.
5,Good Product,"So far so good. I used this product on the side of a lazy boy recliner that my male cat sprayed on. It smelled really bad. Tried Natures Miracle several times and it didn't work. I put the Pet Ordor and Stain Eliminator in a spray bottle and added some warm water, sprayed the area and put a towel over the side of the chair for a day. Took the towel off that night when I got home and the chair didn't stink anymore. This product is worth a try."
3,"Just okay, did not prevent my cat from peeing again and again.","I liked the idea of bacteria (natural) cleaning or destroying cat's pee which is about one of the hardest things to get out of my carpet. First, I need to say that I have a cat that has some really bad annoying habits of not using the litter boxes and finding places like my bedroom carpet to pee. This is partly a bad habit of hers, I assume something she did all her life (I adopted her when she was older) so the habit was there. No matter how much you clean, she still goes and pees. I was anxious to try this hoping the smell would go away, using almost the entire bottle to clean out the smell and prevent her from continuing this bad habit. No luck, the carpet still smells like pee no matter how much I steam clean the carpet out. I am now going to try Anti-Icky poo. Sighhhhh!"
3,Probable Cause,I enjoyed this movie and have watched it several more times since. The special effects leave something to be desired but I enjoyed the story. It has a good story and Michael Ironside is good in it. His character experience change and realizations as the story develops. You will especially like this movie if you are a fan of Michael Ironside.
1,Probable Cause for skipping this video,"This movie is neither suspenseful nor provocative. Anyone waiting to be at the edge of their seat, or eager to see a little softcore ""action"" will be immensely disappointed. The acting is certainly B and one could not even press a case for any substantive erotica. This movie tries to be something its not - stimulating."
1,Rusting,I purchased these scissors out of frustration from other kitchen scissors and the great reviews given on here. I have had these less than a month and they are rusting. These scissors have been handwashed and thoughly hand dried after every use. I am stuck with these as I disposed of the packaging already.
5,Still Terrific After Twenty Years,"This is the second pair of Joyce Chen scissors that I now own. My first pair, purchased some twenty years ago, still function as they did when new. The ergonomic handles are comfortable, strong and useable with either hand. The steel blades remain sharp even after cutting a wide variety of materials. I've never found the need to re-sharpen these scissors. I particularly like the length of the blades in this model. Their shorter and narrower dimensions give the user much greater control when cutting smaller items than would otherwise be realized employing larger units. I wholeheartedly recommend these to everyone. In my opinion, they're some of the best scissors money can buy."
4,Great for gardening,I use these mostly for deadheading flowers in the garden. They're very sharp. The small tip is great for snipping smaller flowers. Fits well in my garden apron.
4,"Pretty good, but not magical (as seen in other reviews)","Wow, these scissors have an extremely good reputation in other reviews.They're nice scissors, but sort of short. They appear well made and they're sharp.I'd say they're better than regular shears for small tasks where you need fine control. I'd recommend getting these in addition to shears rather than as a replacement.Nice all all around though. 4 stars."
4,More Red Kitchen Accesories from Amazon,Nice light scissors. They will be very useful in the kitchen and for other applications around the house. The red colour makes them easy to locate.
1,Useless for lefties,"I got these scissors as a stocking stuffer. When I told Santa they turned out to be no good for me, she was taken aback - these were supposed to be great scissors, and good for lefties.The scissors were good for a few uses, but in a short time the hinge loosened to the point that I can't cut anything with them left handed. Most ""ambidextrous"" scissors are regular right-handed scissors with no special design feature other than a tight hinge. When gripped right-handed, the hand naturally pushes the blades of the scissors together. When gripped left-handed, the blades get pushed apart. Obviously a loose hinge on supposedly ambidextrous scissors makes them no good for left handed people.Even if I were right-handed and the loose hinge did not make the scissors useless (they do still work right-handed), I would still say that any pair of scissors with a loose hinge after only a couple weeks of normal kitchen use is simply junk. These scissors are expensive junk."
3,Sharp and Sharp,"Cutting is a breeze with these shears. The length of the blades was disappointingly short, though. I had expected them to be large enough to shear chicken wings and the like but they struggle to fit many broccoli florets. Think more of cutting herbs than chickens and you'll be quite pleased with these sturdy little shears."
3,junkhater,"This scissor is an average item, but nothing to rave about. Very short blade length, does not disassemble for cleaning. Good leverage, handle loops are too large for smaller hands. Sorry to state this product is over-priced compared to what is out there and to other better designed scissors I own and use."
5,Great,Best kitchen scissors I have every had.................this is a second pair JUST FOR ME because I like to keep my kitchen tools in excellent condition
1,rust starts to grow after less than a month of use!,"After less than a month of use, rust starts to grow near the hinge area. This is quite unacceptable for a product that is advertised to be ""recommended by professional chefs."
5,great product,"I love these scissors! I use them to make flowers arrangements,for light pruning in my garden, and in my kitchen . I have several pairs and I have given them as gifts to just about everyone I know . Joyce Chen makes another scissor called the ultimate ""GARDEN"" scissor that is great too , unfortunately they are hard to find . They have a slightly longer arm for better pruning and are more expensive. The price of the Kitchen scissors varies A LOT so don't pay more than $22.00. I have payed as low as $17.00 for a pair. Amazon prices fluctuate too so just keep checking until you see it go under 22.00 .BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SHARE A PAIR WITH YOUR FRIENDS"
4,Dual purpose scissors,I had heard that these scissors were great both in the kitchen and in jewellery making so I bought two pairs. One have gone straight into my cutlery drawer where they can be used for cutting chicken etc and the other apir reside with my jewellery tools where they are great for cutting bezel wire and not squashing it.
5,Best Kitchen Scissors Ever,"I first used the Joyce Chen scissors taking a cooking class at our local junior college more than 25 years ago. The instructor said they were the best scissors she had found to be used in the kitchen; she was right. They fit in your hand comfortably and are light weight. You can cut up a chicken or slice a piece of paper and the blades don't become dull. Thank you for making them available through your site. They are great as gifts for wedding showers, house warming or just to have an extra pair around the house. I'm a very Happy customer!!!"
2,Sharp scissors for about a month,"I knew the scissors would be small and they are, very. But if they were easy to use and sharp (would cut chicken bone) I'd love them. They did just that, cut up meat, bone, cardboard, plastic, just about everything for about a month. Now they are dull in spots and a pain to use just like my other scissors.Perhaps I should have just used them for food although many good reviews said they used them for lots of stuff.Update: March, 2009. 1 star. These won't even cut cellophane now."
4,Not as delicious as some other Trollops',A humorous and wise exploration of human values and ethics with a jaundiced look at members of the Clergy in this nineteenth century novel.Some of the characters are memorable. Trollop's use of surnames is funny and telling -- as John Bold surely was!Always a delight to get into the world of this widely read and appreciated writer.
3,The Warden,This book was very difficult to read. The language was archaic. I did enjoy the complexity of the story. Historical fiction is my favorite area.
3,Unfulfilled expectations,"This book was difficult to read as it contains references to the religious life of the Anglican church in Victorian Ebgland, events and politics quite unfamiliar to the American reader. The main plot about the Rev. Harding is interesting and engaging. But while the story in itself is worthwhile Trollope presents too many rabbit trails."
1,WRONG PICTURE ON THIS AD... WAKE UP AMAZON AUTO,"AMAZON HAS THE WRONG PICTURE. The picture is a Bosch Distributor cap for an old-timey 1970's or 80's care before electronic ignition. The PART DESCRIPTION is a WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADE, NOT A DISTRIBUTOR CAP. I am hoping I get a wiper blade, not a cap. Thanks for correcting please."
1,Didn't work,"Didn't work from the start. Ended up putting in the old one as just one of the prongs was a little bent and just had to bend it a little to get high fan to work. Relay is for fan motor, fan did not work on any setting."
4,Great Reception,I have a Recoton TV575 and get wonderful reception...I also have a Recoton TV200 which does a poorer job. I do wish the design was less chunky...it's a bit much sitting on top of the TV. Hope you get a shipment soon.
1,Not good if you live in the basement,"I had some difficulty getting channels 2-6 (low band)with this antenna. These channels tend to be very hard to tune into because of electrical interference. Plus, the fact that I live in a basement. Outdoor antennae are still the best provided you don't have to drop your coax cable beyond 15 ft."
1,Touring Ireland,"This was not at all what I expected. There there was no ""flow"" or order to the ""tour"". When towns were mentioned, you had to have a map available becasue the video did not show the location clearly and it jumped from east to west. The ""feeling"" of/for Ireland was nil. The videos of the areas did not make you want to visit Ireland. Terrible! I would never have ordered this video if I had seen it first. Matter of fact, I turned it off before the end."
3,The Engines of Nod,"I'm an avid sci-fi reader who just couldn't get through this book. It has an intriguing premise and all, but by the middle of the book I just didn't care anymore. The author doesn't develop his characters enough to make a difference one way or another."
5,Interstellar Anthropology,"In the Engines of God, Jack McDevitt weaves together a series of familiar science fiction motifs to create a mystery novel on a grand scale. Like Arthur C. Clarke's classic Rendezvous with Rama, the story of a vast alien spacecraft that enters our solar system that enters our solar system, providing astronaughts with a brief glipse of otherworldly splendor before departing, McDevitt's novel is concerned with the potential wonders of interstellar anthropology.The success of McDevitt's novel is in his strong depiction of the alien culture of Quaraqua, as seen through its artifacts and texts. His depictions of the translated fragments of their writings, and their artwork, ring with a poetic authenticity that is at once beautiful and mysterious."
5,The Engines of God,"Action Packed, Jack can really write action fiction. Combine the immense scale this man can create with his words and tightly crafted characters in this book and you have a true masterpiece. Jack is writing a sequal to this particular novel (Bubonicon, 2001) and you get a chance to explore, ""what next"" from this ending. I love the historical approach this novel takes and the grand vistas it encompases. There is a central mystery and a hunt to unravel the mysytery leads the reader along the trail of aliens, now presumed extinct. I had real problems laying this book down. Jack McDevitt reminds me of Iain M Banks in scope, and Dan Simmons in Character developement. Make up your own mind about why this writer has been a Nebula finalist so many times. This book was superior to the Hugo winner the year of its publication."
3,Seemingly Marching To Death,"I was looking to read some sci-fi by an author I hadn't read and settled on Mr. McDevitt. I'm glad I did, though I don't beleive I will read another by him. I agree with one reviewer who said the characters lacked depth, I didn't really feel anything when one died. That didn't bother me too much, but what did bother me was the authors rise and fall from one near deathly catastrophe to the next. After awhile there's just no point in it, I don't beleive the story any longer. The last 30 or so pages just went on and on, I'm still not sure I know what all happened, but there was no sense of ending to me, even assuming their may be more books in the series, this one could have ended for me, but it really didn't."
2,Who thought that Archeologist were interesting,"It was hard to get interested in a novel where most of the players to the plot had been dead for thousands of years. Sci-fi should be based on doing something, not having boring characters discussing dead civilizations and non-happenings.In addition, the living characters were dull and stupid and seemed to unaware that they were on other planets or that a dangerous situation could exist anywhere.It would also be nice if Mr Devitt actually knew a little science to go with his fiction"
5,"Original, engrossing take on ""First Contact"" theme!","""First Contact"" is one of the most overworked themes in Science Fiction. It's getting tough for authors to find anfresh approach! Jack McDevitt succeeds in ""The Engines of God"". Like Clarke's classic ""Rama"" series, this newnovel draws you in with weird, wonderful, creepy alien technology and architecture. Are the Monument Builders evil oror angels? Read and decide..."
5,"Intriguing and enjoyable, this book was great!","This book was a very enjoyable read. I'm eagerly awaitingthe sequel. There were many unanswered questions that I'mwaiting to find out about.This book takes a look at the notion that the Universe maybe a very hostile place. Waves of energy periodicallywipe out civilizations. What are their purpose?Jack, don't keep me waiting long!"
2,Nobody Likes Wasted Words,"There's nothing more infuriating than a story that's about 5 times longer that it should have been because the author for some inexplicable reason decides to get into ridiculous details about everything from the scenery to people's private lives, none of which have anything to do with the tale and serve only to make the reading process a chore and a bore. You just want to scream at them: ""If you've got a story to tell then get on with it already!"" I gave up after the first few chapters. I've got a life to live."
4,McDevitt Begins,Start of McDevitt's Space Academy books. Great characters and interesting ideas. Keep em coming!
3,"Great concept, not much action","I loved this book for the concepts it created and showed to the reader - set in the future with earth battling for surviving resources and humans expanding amongst the stars. The mystery and saga of the plot itself was great however there was little action to speak of. The characters miander along with a few introduced here and there who seem to play little part. The parts that did hold action though kept me rapt in the ensuing pages. Would have loved a little more alien interaction but this book i feel is very much setting the scene for the follow up books to The Engines of God. I will probably try reading ""The Rho Agenda"" or ""The Ringworld"" series before i purchase another Jack McDevitt book, although I'm open to it."
4,Sci fi the way I like it,"This is my favourite Science fiction premise: in the future humans discover the remains of an ancient alien civilization in our solar system. Who were they? Where did they go?In Jack McDevitt's enjoyable 'The Engines of God' the alien civilization is known as The Monument Makers, as they have left monuments in our solar system and other nearby solar systems.We follow Priscilla Hutchinson ('Hutch') and a team of archaeologists as they try to uncover the mystery of the Monument Makers.The book is quite engrossing and is set up in a serial fashion with four different parts each with it's own rising action and climax, with the mystery only solved at the last climax. It also sets up for sequels which there are currently five."
3,"Good, Not Great","McDevitt came up with a very good idea. For the most part, his story is well told. It's weak in the action scenes though - too little preparation for pivotal events, so too many events just happen without any build-up of dramatic tension. There are not that many characters considering the scope of the story, but I still had a bit of trouble keeping relationships and names straight because McDevitt spends too little time embedding them. The Engines of God is well worth reading nevertheless. It's a truly original story that should definitely be read before starting Omega (the even better sequel)."
2,The Engines of God,It was a long boring book. I would not buy it again. I gave it to the local library.
2,Too slow - almost boring,"The idea is not bad. But a book has to inspire its readers for the whole length of it, not only for the last 100 or so pages, when the story finally picks up some speed. Long dialogues and descriptions are alright when they contribute to the development of the plot, but they are not a value in itself, as which we can see them here very often. The characters may be conceivable, but their actions are slow and sometimes their motivation remains in the dark. Often the descriptions of the circumstances blur your imagination rather than make things clear.The fact that there is no ending makes me fear there will be sequel. I am not sure I will read it."
2,Plodding First of a Series,"OK. I liked ""Polaris"" and really enjoyed ""Seeker"", but this one didn't really do much for me. Rather plodding pacing and not much of a resolution at the end."
1,A DIFFICULT-TO-READ SCI-FI BORE!,"Wow!I found this book difficult to read and boring all at the same time. After the first 100 pages, the story goes absoultely nowhere and after another 100 pages the story still goes absoultely nowhere and so on. By the way, none of the characters come close to being remotely interesting or intriguing. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED.Instead, read EXPENDABLE by James Alan Gardner. A novel that's ten times more satisfying and better than this."
4,I have herd the album,I have herd the album Back in the 90's and have seen the group live....the music gives you a feel good feeling about your self....and is smooth to listen to.
4,A solid find...,"Hippie rock for those who have sworn off the genre. Hobex gets back to basics and makes fun, melodic, dare I say groovy music. The lead singer (his name escapes me) has the kind of soulful voice rarely heard among today's popsters. Check 'em out."
4,Great Introduction,"I found this book great introduction to those willing to have a first introduction to the subject. The title says ""...in physical sciences"" and this partly why I did not rate it 5*. I believe there is a room for improvement by adding problems from physical sciences and using standard packages such as Matlab. That will make it greater asset in the subject area."
5,Ridiculously cool,"This nifty little gizmo is all kinds of fun. It's not super bright, but in normal it's noticable and at night (think candle light) it's gorgeous. Words of caution, don't over tighten or else it can be a bear to get off, pick a sink that's fairly deep or else it inhibits movement.Finally to address all of the complaints of it not turning off, here's the deal folks, it's not a pressure switch, it's an electronic switch, the water short circuits a little electronic gizmo and turns on the light. Now if you have the little electronic gizmo gets a drop of water on it, it will continue to remain lite, so rotate the assembly until the water doesn't stick on the little golden contacts. Have fun!"
1,Loved the light--didn't last two weeks.,"Installed it at the kitchen sink, it lasted maybe two weeks. Bought new batteries, light would not shut off after water had been turned on and batteries ran out again. Save your money."
2,beware: may not fit,"Despite another reviewer's warning, I ordered the faucet light. With or without the ""adapter"", this light would not fit any of the faucets in my home."
2,Great idea - bad implementation,"This was really fun for about 2 weeks. After that, the light would just stay on all the time, and then the batteries died (because the light was on all the time). So now we just have this weird plastic thingie on our faucet because I haven't gotten around to putting the old screen back on."
2,Great idea but unreliable.,"Great idea and novelty, but unreliable and needs more engineering. At night it lights up the water basin which really looks neat. The color change from blue for cold and red for hot is unreliable and a lot of times doesn't work at all. I would definately hold off buying it until they retool it and make it more reliable. Great idea if it worked better. Friends love it. Good conversation piece."
2,Not Working,"fast shipping easy to install,water leaked out trough the top, looked cool but stop working after 2 weeks not worth buying"
2,cool idea,"Cool idea but upon hooking it up it was broken. I went to screw it on and noticed it was broken so I had to glue the top together. Then the water comes out on an angle, and sometimes the light won't turn off. it's also a little big."
2,"Great, if it worked for more than an hour!","I received this faucet light,and it had batteries included.I attached it easy enough,and it worked fine for about two hours. If I have to replace the batteries every other day, it's not worth it."
1,Might be great if it fit,"Yet another disappointed customer - ordered in spite of all the reviews saying it might not fit. Sure enough, it doesn't fit any faucets in our entire house - and we had TONS of them to try. Broke my little boy's heart. Maybe there could be something in the desription that says exactly what kind of faucet this DOES fit. Ours are very standard sizes, and all made within the last 10 years. Huge disappointment."
2,blue light faucet,I thought this would be really a neat thing but it turns out its not. #1 it has no instructions that come with it #2 after we installed the batteries and made sure it was all put in right we put it on the faucet and it would not work. It worked off of the faucet but not on it about the only thing that I thing is good is the price I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Toy vs. Novelty,I don't consider this a toy. There is no real play value. It is a novelty item and is a good conversation piece. The technology is intersting.
5,Book - Light Force by Brother Andrew,"Book was sold by a fantastic dealer (greenpi), who gave me a refund (I did not even ask for) simply because there one line underlined in ball-point, probably by accident when a request for feedback was inserted into the book. The book was in excellent unused condition, otherwise, and I will always use this seller when possible. BTW: the book was an excellent recap of a ministers efforts and fruits in with the Palestinian Christians in Palestine. I recommend it to those interested in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians."
3,"Uh... Bizarre, beautiful, but...","Great sets & costumes, like a beautifully odd dream. But it is slow and there's no reason to care for any of these characters, so I lost interest.I'm glad to have seen it, but much more glad that I didn't buy it."
3,HBS-110 not quite there....,"This new unit is very well made and user friendly in use. I like the outboard 110v charger, but some will prefer the USB charger route, which this unit does not have.The headphones don't fit very well and the sound quality is fine for speech or phone use, but seems lacking to me as far as music reproduction goes. There is plenty of volume available. But, there is no way to attach a different set of headphones to it, as there is no jack...they are hard wired.I'd like it a lot better if it had good ear-buds, or a way for the user to change to the headset they preferred...and better sound quality for music."
1,the worst crawford movie ever made!!,"this has to be the absolute, most boring, non-ending movie i have ever had the painful experience to sit through. i would have turned it off, but i wanted to see how bad it would be by the end (if i didnt die beforehand, as the movie lasted approx. 82 years). i usually love good old joan, but this really s*****."
5,John Garfield fan,"I would always watch this movie when it came on television, but it was on so infrequently that I finally decided to buy it. The soundtrack is outstanding. You can't go wrong with Garfield and Crawford, and in a supporting role the talented Oscar Levant."
4,humoresque,"This is a great acting/movie vehicle for John Garfield and Joan Crawford.The duo has great charisma and the storyline is unpredictable. One of the over-looked great films of this gentre. Diane(DK) K., Oak Lawn, IL"
3,Missing a Crescendo,"Humoresque is the story of Paul Boray (John Garfield) and Helen Wright (Joan Crawford). Boray is a violinist; since he was 11 years old, his life has been dedicated to the instrument. When he performs in the home of the wealthy Wright, sparks fly, and though she is married the two begin a love affair. She helps him to succeed in the music world, and as the two get closer, Boray's mother becomes more worried. The relationship seems doomed to fail thanks to Boray's fierce loyalty to his music and Wright's addiction to alcohol.The performances in this film are very good. Robert Blake opens with a very sweet appearance as the young Boray. The two stars emote very well. Crawford does not truly achieve success in her role until the fantastically emotional ending.The problem with this film is that though it begins and ends very well, the middle is quite boring and drawn out."
5,Warning for those on the wagon ... Smoking & Drinking,"This is a wonderful film but I wanted to warn viewers who are not supposed to be drinking alcohol or smoking: Joan Crawford is smoking and drinking in each and every scene! She never puts her glass down and always has smoke coming out of her. I have been on the wagon for smoking for 16 months now and I would not watch it. It's not fair for someone else to be smoking when I can't. Just a simple warning and I do not mean to denigrate the movie. I think Joan looks her best in this film, she is ultra glamourous and is dressed to kill in every scene. John Garfield did his finest work and his role is very believable. The violin music is great, too. 5 stars but be warned, it makes one want a glass of bourbon and a Chesterfield filter tip in every scene."
2,Humoresque,"The DVD came in a timely fashion, but had sticker residue directly on the cover, which was incredibly annoying to clean off."
4,"Beautiful Music, Sad Story","This is a story of two lonely people who end up destroying their lives together. Joan Crawford (unhappily married alcoholic socialite Helen Wright) meets young violinist John Garfield (Paul Boray), and finds him to be the one toy she can't break. (Boray's music is dubbed by Isaac Stern.) Boray had grown up in the slums, received a violin from his mother as a birthday present, and then practiced constantly. Crawford eventually gets a divorce, and then realizes that Boray's in love only with his music."
3,"Not my favorite Joan, but worth a look...","Fans of the campy, over-exaggerated Joan will not find much of that business in this film. I admit it took me several viewings to get through the entire length of this movie as I often became mostly bored. It is musically beautiful and the writing is fun and intellectual, but it is tough to sit through the laborious musical sequences unless you have a taste for it. Those who lean toward the symphonic arts will love this film for those attributes. Otherwise, if you are looking for a B-Movie Joan at her catty best, skip this one and look instead to The Damned Don't Cry or I Saw What You Did & I Know Who You Are..."
4,Garfield Shines With Excellent Story,"Garfield and Crawford's character are developed with exquisite detail, and this is a great movie. An added plus is Oscar Levant's presence. His witty and scathing one liners offered a nice foil to the rest of the story. Of all of the movies I have seen him in, he plays a lot more piano in this one, which is just awesome and a great sight to see and a great sound to hear.Joan Crawford is quite a presence, no doubt. But she overacts BIG TIME in this movie. She should have offered a little more subtlety to her role.A good buy. This is one of the best old movies I have ever seen."
4,DVD Humoresque,"It was a wonderful old movie when the writers, director, actors, and crews, were dedicated to there craft. And it showed. Classic!Jack. Palo Alto, CA"
1,The Birds by Tarjei Vesaas,I did not read this book until after I had it for a while and when I did read it page 217 was backed by page 220.When I wrote to Tartan Frog and complained they refused to do anything about it because it was so long before I noticed the page missing. I will not use them again. The story was fine I just wish I had a perfect book.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for a self-help book for a family member who has not yet consented to attend AA. The foreword alone is insulting and I know they would never get past that before laying the book down. It is dry and difficult reading. It took the author three chapters and a graph to explain that an alcoholic has to drink more and more to feel better and sinks further into depression each time. Why not just say it. Maybe this book is intended more for the person studying alcoholism, not living with it. Clinical studies and statistics won't put them on the road to recovery. I'm glad I read it first. If this was the first book I got them to read, it would be the last."
1,good advise quit tomarrow,best advise ever the idea of quitting tommaro and drinking today is the easiesst yet the most satisfing way to stop drinking with out aa the boring AA. well ill stop tomarrow
3,Mainly useful for the C API library and header files on CD,This book covers many topics at a fairly superficial level. The C API section is very incomplete compared to the Word Developer's kit book. There is no index.
1,Worthless!,"This book is shockingly incomplete. I could not find any details on FP even though the book mentions it as an argument and leaves it up to the reader to figure out how Excel uses it. Also, the examples are so elementary it is sickening. For example, when the book explains SAFEARRAY the example given is for a one dimensional array. BIG DEAL. The real challenge is dealing with multi-dimensional arrays. I was surprised by the lack of detail in this book especially coming from Microsoft Press."
1,"Horrible, useless rife with errors","While there may be books covering the subject of real analysis worth even less than this book, I am not aware of their existence. My professor even admits Trench's book is not very good and only used it because the two of them are friends. The bonds of fraternity are not so strong; however that he will ever use it again.Of particular disinterest are chapters 5 and 6. Both are so full of mathematical errors that I suggest any student, unfortunate enough to use this book, supplement his or her reading by finding a text that manages to actually define what a gradient is."
1,Not as advertised.,"Not only did it take almost three weeks to receive it, it was not the Oxford World Classic that I was expecting. It was a publication from Dover. I was specifically hoping for the Oxford edition."
1,Belkin F1U126-KIT Bitronics Auto Switch Kit,The Belkin F1U126-KIT Bitronics Auto Switch Kitwas easily installed and has worked fine.
1,Belkin F5C895-TEL Surge Suppressor,"I bought the Belkin Gold Series Surgemaster II F5C895-TEL more than 3 years ago. Recently I had a problem with equipment plugged into the surge suppressor and the problem was traced to the power strip (the green light that is supposed to be on saying the strip is protecting was not on). When I purchased the power strip it came with a Lifetime Warranty. I contacted Belkin to use the warranty - the Belkin responsevia email, was that what they gave me was a LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANY and that since they are no longer producing this power strip they will not honor their warranty. They sent me a link to purchase another one. So I called their Customer Care Dept. at 800-223-5546, and they told me that the Limited Lifetime Warranty is only good while they are producing the product and after that they don't support or replace the defective product. This seems UNSATISFACTORY to me. I thought a Lifetime Warranty would be good as long as I owned the product."
1,"plug housing fell apart, very dangerous!","I have been trying to contact Belkin about this product. I have one that I used for a few years, and when I pulled the plug out, the plastic housing cracked apart, leaving exposed wires and the electrical prongs firmly embedded in the live electrical outlet. I had to go to our breaker box and shut down power to the outlets, then used a screwdriver to pry the exposed plug from the wall outlet. REALLY poor material use, made in China with out safety standards. Boo to this company."
5,Time For A Reissue,"In the 70's & 80's Sheldon Kopp was a major contributor to the - then popular - fields of Humanistic and Gestalt Psychotherapy. No Hidden Meanings was a ""toss off"" article to the Journal ""Voices"". It was certainly one of his best. It comprises 43 ""Eternal Truths"" by Kopp and the wonder-filled repeatedly evocative B&W photography of Claire Flanders. This is a work in the spirit of the Tao Te Ching and of Zen. It is a centering experience to read and to see. We can only hope that its publisher, Science & Behavior Books, Palo Alto,CA will reissue it. Amazon.com will track it down for you as a used book. PB; ca. 50 unnumbered pages; ISBN: 0-8314-0043-9"
5,A beautiful book,"A very simple, beautiful, inspirational book. I love the writing of Sheldon Kopp. This is a summary of his best words. I read this often, to remind me, what is really important in life."
5,Great original stand up!!,"I remember watching this comedy show as a kid and I thought it was the greatest stand up I've ever seen now 14 years later It still sticks in my mind,HOWIE at the time introduced me to little bobby which was laughs!!,I know this is not eddie murphy,it's not chris rock but it is howie mandel at his very best and you can not go wrong with this video."
3,Howie Mandel Movie,"I was a little disappointed in the quality of the movie. There are about 7 different times in the movie that it ""skips"" in the tracking where the screen goes blank, gets very grainey & snowey. They should have revealed that information before they sold it."
1,Should be rated!! Adults only!,"... We have always found Howie very funny on his tv show, however the tape was not and very offensive. Wish someone had offered this info before we bought it. Hope it helps you."
5,Great Cookbook! Delicious Recipes! User Friendly!,"As a collector of cookbooks I know quality when I see it. This cookbook contains delicious taste-tempting recipes that are simple and easy to prepare. Sue Carroll is to be commended for creating an elegant/""user friendly"" cookbook. It makes an excellent gift!"
5,"Exceptional, charming, delicious...and useful!","I found this book and the recipes in it to be of exceptional quality. It provides wonderful, fairly simple recipes for delicious things, while capturing the charm of the Mainstay Inn. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
2,"Really wanted to like, BUT","I have to agree with the other reviewer who found some recipes dry and tasteless. Several years ago I had an opportunity to visit the Inn. The book purchase was to be a trip momento as well as a working cookbook - my family loves brunch/tea items.Unfortunately, I haven't found one recipe that's ""a keeper."" Everything I've made from it has come out technically okay and is edible, but is either dry (if cake) or not particularly tasty (if a savory dish). There are a lot of recipes, so maybe there's something in the index that tastes as good as it sounds. However, I don't think at this point I want keep trying 'just one more,' knowing the work, ingredients, or leftovers are likely to go to waste. Wish I knew which recipes the other reviewers particularly liked.I do really like the book's design/layout, including the vintage Victorian illustrations, and enjoyed visiting the Inn."
4,The Best,Every engineering student and computer science student should get this book. It really helps prepare you for Calculus.
3,alright,"This book does provide coverage of all major material in traditional calculus,however the manner in which the material is presented is similar to that of a condensed textbook, which is neither entertaining nor completely clear. If you want a quick study guide then this is the book for you,provided you understand most information you read in a textbook. All in all, this book is alright, but I wouldn't depend solely on it."
3,Beginner's Calculus,"This book is great for when you're beginning Calculus, but it doesn't give intense hard problems for it. Great study guide to review the basics but isn't the hardcore stuff."
3,"kinda pointless, same examples you'll encounter in your book","not that great, if you have a good text, you'll notice that the examples are pretty much the same"
5,"Indispensible if you want the ""A""...","My instructor had a nervous breakdown about 1 month into an integral calculus class. He spent the rest of the semester discussing his personal problems during class, instead of teaching. He stopped giving tests and cancelled his office hours. We had a midterm, which I failed (with a 28/100), along with the rest of the class. My entire grade hinged on the final exam. I bought this book and spent the last half of the year using this book to teach me integral calculus. Two weeks before the final, the instructuor told the class that he was throwing out the midterm, and that our grade for the class would be based solely on our performance on the final exam.I got a 96/100 on the final, and an ""A"" for the course. This book saved me. (This sounds ridiculous, I know...but it is absolutely true.)"
2,I wish it had more....,"This book was a bummer, man. I LOVED the Schaum's Outline for PreCalculus and it was awesome. This book however, left me wanting more. It needs more SOLVED exercises. In each section you get about 3-5 solved problems and then 10-15 problems with answers without solutions. I bought this book hoping it would be a supplement to my text book, but it just didn't have enough step-by-step solutions which is what I need when I'm learning new material."
2,This phone is a pain.,This phone is horribly tedious to program. It is really confusing and time consuming to get it up and running. I would not recommend this phone.
2,Poor quality,"This phone worked well for a while. Then the menu that deletes all the Caller ID history at once disapeared and now it forces you to delete each entry at a time - ludicrous. Then 6 months later the little caller-id screen starts going out and as a result the name & numbers no longer can be read in their entirety. So now it's guessing, is that a ""6"" or is that an ""8""?Poor quality - works only if you do not want the caller id functions."
1,Started falling apart upon setup!,"I bought this for my Motif ES6 and was very disappointed. Yamaha no longer makes the motif bag which is what I had, so I thought this bag would do the trick, boy was I wrong. Compared to the Yamaha bag I had (which lasted for 3 years, heavy gigging) this bag started falling apart as soon as I put it together. 2 of the zipper holders broke off as soon as I put my Motif in the bag and tried to close it up. Not to mention putting th bag together the seems inside the bag ripped very easily since they were made out of cheap nylon. I would not recommend this bag for any synth that is over 15 lbs because it is just not durable enough. I got what I paid for, that for sure."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"If you like to buy this book, please buy the OLD EDITION. Without mentioning this fact in the web site or intoduction to the book, this new edition surprisely DID NOT contained many of the photos contained in the old edition! I mistakenly buy this edition and fell into the trap! I have to retun it to Amazon. The old edition (soft over) is both cheaper and contained many interesting photos not reproduced in the new edition."
5,Have you ever is one of the best songs.,"This is an Awesome S club song. Such a touching feeling with Jo on leads, She does a great job."
3,Bad taste,"This seems like a good quality shake, but the taste is horrible! It has a strong taste of Iron. I tried mixing it in milk and water, but I still have to choke it down."
3,Bad taste!,This shake tastes HORRIBLE! The chocolate flavor has a very strong Iron taste. I tried mixing with water and milk but I still had to choke it down.
2,Very basic model.,"Comes with pre-set code, you can not change it to any 4 digit code you want - although you can try to change the combination for example the code 5392 can be changed to 9253, 9325 etc but doing so you can easily break the inter-locking clip (due to its poor quality) and make the combination cable useless."
2,For quick stops only.,"I went through a cable like just like this one (it was a Kryptonite, actually) with a hacksaw in less than 60 seconds. It really surprised me how easy is was to defeat."
1,A piece of junk,"Only used it about 10 times and the cable detached from the lock.It is made so cheap that it falls apart already.Trashed, useless piece of junk."
4,pioneers,"Belgian alternative electronic 80's band. They were pioneers, together with Front242, in the so-called 'Electronic Body Music'. The CD contains all their greatest hits, but I was hoping to hear *the original* version of TV Treated. Nonetheless, it's still an amazing collection."
5,got what I wanted,It is absolutely what I wanted. It is the same item that we saw at a specialty gift shop for four times as much. Good quality plush toy.
1,"dear deicide,",please pray to your lord satan to give you more talent serously it sounds like raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh rulah satan is lord rooooooooooooooo raaaaaaaaaaaaaaa re ro ro ro your boat gently down to hell im mean dear god we get it you love satan the fans will say im not a metal fan but im only into REAL metal not RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH RAG ROOOOOO do me a favor and pick up gwars new album now thats a band
1,Give it up Benton,"How anyone can listen to this [contaminated] matter is beyond me. I have never heard anything so void of talent as this crap being spewed by the satanist Benton. Dude, do us all a favor and go talk to someone(JESUS maybe) that might be able to help you. Go work for Wal-Mart and leave the music stuff to talented individuals who actually have something to offer. My only regret is having to give one star. Unfortunately, negative stars don't exist with this format."
5,great death metal,"great death metal, as one would expect from the legends. i am usually very picky about when newer stuff comes out, but i'd say this is one of their best, easily."
2,Not exactly their best work........,"I've been listening to Deicide for some time now and I think that some of their most mind-blowing CD's are In Torment In Hell and Legion. When I first heard that Scars of the Crucifix had came out, I was eager to get it. After listening to the first few tracks, I got bored. Being a musician myself, I felt the music was good but the songs didn't cause any reaction from me. Most songs sounded similar and the CD got boring awfully fast. I would recommend this CD to hardcore Deicide fans and for people starting to listen to death metal, I would recommend stuff like Darkthrone, Necrophagist, Psycroptic, Abigor, etc."
3,Meh,"""Scars"" is not bad. I was definetly hoping for more though. There arent many catchy parts that deicide is known for. It almost all sounds the same. I really like how glen double tracked his vocals like in the old days, but i think he may have used it too much, there arent many parts in the song where he isnt singing, it kinda makes the whole thing sound a little boring."
4,..and Satan lives,"To think that Deicide would ever have to make a comeback album..is a tragedy in itself; after all, back in 1995..this was THE BAND. When I was 15 years old, I bought Legion and praised that as one of the best albums of all times. AS years passed, my interest in Deicide's music waned, but my loyalty did not. I used to think Glen Benton was cool and had some conviction,but at last the mystique is gone..now I just see him as someone releasing music to put clothes on his kids' backs..oh well. Let's face it..the guy's statements and lyrics are contradictory and immature..he doesn't even like death metal. But folks...this album will smash your f**king face in..and that's all we really want from Deicide..isn't it??"
5,Deicide !!,I got to check the CD out wth the guitarist Brian. It by far is the best Deicide CD since the old days. Support the true Death Metal bands like Deicide by buying this CD. You won't be disappointed Deicide put alot of work into this CD and it shows. LONG LIVE MORRISSOUND !!
4,My Bible,This album speaks the truth.I agree with everything this band has to say. See I was force to go cruch and I hated it have hear same sh^t all the time. They know god better then that chruch. The music is some grate death metal. Benton has one of the best voices in exstrem muisc.Drums are grate
1,Worse Death Metal Band On The Planet!,"I really don't understand how anybody listens to this bunch ofSh*t! These guys just plain suck musically! All Deicide sings about is Satan and putting down Christianity in some form or the other.I saw their video for ""Scars of the Crucifix."" It just plain sucked! Fans of death metal, don't waste your money on this crap! Only unintellegent, uneducated and feeble minded people listen to this stuff.If you want to listen to real metal get cd's by Slayer, Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, Morbid Angel, Fear Factory, Machine Head, Slipknot, Arch Enemy, Hatebreed, DamagePlan, In Flames, Chimaira, etc."
2,"Good music,but grow up Glen","I've never been a fan of Deicide explicit,god bashing lyrics,but there music is top notch.Glen who is now probably 36 or so i'm assuming,really needs to grow up and stop blaming god for all his trouble's and start blaming himself.I myself am not a strong believer in a god at all but at least i don't go around criticising,and cursing him all the time.Yes i'm angered that IF there is a god he hasn't done anything to stop world problems but hey thats life.Anyhow this is pretty much the same trash as always,although the music does rock.And no i didnt by this crap,i downloaded it..then got rid of it:)"
3,good comeback album,"Let me take back what I said about this in my review on deicide(self titled). At first the only good track I could find on here was the title track,and the rest of the songs were all the same. Now I'm listening to this cd and realizing that there are other good songs on this cd than just #1. Now i find the tracks that used to be boring having complicated,but well done riffs and amazing guitar solos. There best album since insineratehymn,but instead of being catchy like insineratehymn and getting sick of the songs real fast,this album keeps you interested with the brutal musicianship,and speed,making this an album you'll still listen to years to come.I forgot to mention Bentons vocals are absolutly terrifying on this album,he never sounded better! If you are a deicide fan,I would suggest you pick this one up. If your new to deicide check out:Deicide,insineratehymn,once upon the cross"
4,CD = Evil DVD = lacking,"I Assume This Is The DVD Version (If It Isnt Dojn't Bother Wasting Your Money On The DVD)Ill Start With The Album, This Short Little Spawn Of Mayham Is Good Deicide And Nothing Else(Even The Song Mad At god Which I Found A lyrical failure) Is good. The DVD however is quite a letdown, the first part is alrihgt explains how the album is made(well how the vocal's are anyways) and it show's in on the band's live's which is alright i guess,some parts were inteesting but i got bored when steve started showing off his gun collection, and i feel that they could have also gotten the video for the title track on here (and a making of feature for that) if they tried."
3,To Gorefreak,"This goes out to that idiot ""Gorefreak"".Man, you have to learn how to spell, your making a complete @$$ of yourself with these reviews you write. Ever hear of this thing called ""grammar""? How on gods green earth did you graduate from the 8th grade with writing/spelling skills like that? What kind of lazy @$$ teachers do we have these days who don't even enforce these kind of basic skills to their students? I can obviously tell that your only a juvinile little idiot that just started listening to metal last week, now you think your some hardcore bad@$$.... go repeat the 8th grade a few times, then MAYBE we will care what you have to say.Just read some of the reviews this kid wrote, you will see why this generation is going to hell.Oh yeah, ""Scars of the Crucifix"" is what i would rate as average in the context of Decide. I mean it is a good album, it is just not up to the standrad of their earlier albums like ""Legion"" or the debut album."
3,(2.5) Not a cd you will find yourself listening to everyday,"Sure, I am a Deicide fan but lets face it people Glen is a poor vocalist and an even worse bassist/ lyricist. Sure are there a few good songs here? Yeah but like all Deicide the religion bashing subject gets old fast. Its all some scam. Glen was married in a church and doesn't even like death metal just does it for the money. Every producer to work with him has said he is the worst bassist they have ever seen, hell, he didn't even have a bass. Guitarist Brian had to buy one for him. Now that guitarist brothers Brian and Eric have left (who were the only real talent in the band) Deicide will most likely fade into the abyss of ""washed up musicians"" Glen won't really mind, as long as he still gets paid. So if you like Deicide you most likely have this cd and your own opinions on it. If you are looking to get into Deicide, don't buy this, downlaod it and if you like more then three or four songs then buy it."
3,Not Very Impressed,"It works but cheaply constructed... backing too thin. You will have to beef it up, and secure it using your own methods."
5,My mom loved it!,"I bought the Draft Dodger for my mom because the one she had was leaking its stuffing! Since I knew winter wasn't over, I ordered this one for her and it was a big hit. Nice size, nice quality and does its job."
3,good quality but overpriced,"Good quality, it definitely stopped the draft in my main leaky window, but I thought it was overpriced a bit. Also I sent one back (a month ago) because it did not fit the other window and haven't received my refund yet."
3,There have to be better ones,"This is clearly well made but it is relatively lightweight, does not sit in the position you put it, requires constant adjustment and still lets a bit of a draft through."
2,eh...,"When ever i listen to these songs I either feel like it's some of my stupid friends recording stupid things. Not that it's a bad thing, I just prefer music on my CD's so where's the music fit in? It makes me want to listen to Mindless Self Indulgence instead. Maybe it's cool if you're a hardcore Mindless Self Indulgence fan, I however am not. I recommend one of their albums over this for anyone not insanely obsessed with MSI, save your money."
2,"Wait, what the [heck]?","Alright, this was NOT MSI. This was Urine and Righ? being goofy. 39 tracks of sound f/x and odd vocals, nothing that really qualifys as an actual song. More like a bunch of jingles for obscene & incomprehensable products. I had ordered it in hopes of getting something with a little more musically quality in it, and I guess I'm just dissapointed that it didn't have any discernable songs. However, I think this CD is amazingly funny, and it's really just something anyone could put on as background music and be entertained for the half hour it runs. Actually, this CD is only 26 minutes long. Another downside and dissapointemnt. [Heck], it would have gotten a better rating from me if it had simply been a little longer."
5,Mindless Indeed,"This is a masterpiece of a CD. Sure the tracks are extremely short but that is what repeat is for. This CD is so great. ""Station wagons are my favorite things because thier made of wood panneling panneling wood panneling wood panneling panneling...."" It doesnt get any better then that!"
1,Definatly not what i expected.,"I bought this cd expecting that it was going to be good old mindless antics, and dont get me wrong thats what it is, but this is garbage. The cd has 39 tracks, but what they dont tell you is that the cd is only 26 minutes long. More than twenty of the tracks are less than ten seconds long and the few songs that have potential last only about a minute and a half. I laughed hysteriaclly at times because its so damn funny, but if you like mindless DONT buy this, it is not mindless at all. And for the first time, i actually want my money back. Buy this record only if you find pleasure in being disappointed."
4,You can go to school and learn about the poo...,"I finally found a copy of this at the mall today after searching high and low for it this whole year. It is a pretty funny cd for the hardcore MSI fan (like me) but it definately isn't for everyone. It has 39 tracks and the whole things 26 minutes long. My favorite songs have to be Parkinlot, Darth Vader, Take A Sh*t, Hardonz, and Mouseybrown. There's also a live MSI video for Panty Shots on here too. Pick this up if think poo is funny and play Hardonz in a public place and see the reaction, it's pretty amusing."
2,"The most beautiful, hard to listen too, crap..","Well.. What can I say? Its just Steve and Jimmy from the great Mindless self indulgence, messing around. There are some great songs on this album though. Hillarious, but only buy it if you are a big big fan of MSI!!!-Mike"
1,I love MSI,"One of the most amazing things about MSI is their awesome talent. Every one of their songs has enough musical ideas crammed into it to make into 3 songs. Then their awesome musical talent clashes with lyrics that appear deranged at first but after repeated listenings you begin to hear whisperings of true genius within them.Now take away the musical content. Many tracks don't even have music and the ones which do don't hold a candle to any MSI track. Then replace the brilliantly insane lyrics with vulgarity from a 5th grader. Now chop it down into 30+ segments totaling 20 minutes. That's ""Left Rights"" and it is horribly, painfully disappointing. I threw my copy away. This CD deserves 0 stars."
2,funkey,what were these guys thinking on this album? it is less then a half an hour in total and has 39 tracks. it was like these guys just spent an afternoon making funny noises and goofy songs a 3rd grader made up and put them on a cd. a lot of the tracks are just really bad. i loved their cd frankenstein girls will seem strangely sexy and i was hoping there was going to be some legit songs on this one. well at least they lived up to their name with left rights. the cover art is what you should expect for the music. i would recommend getting either frankenstein girls or the tight album if you can find it.
3,133 EZ RATCHET TUBING CUTTER,light duty sears makes a new heavy duty that tightens in a better spot at the end of the handle
2,Jay Leno,"Hello, Weak at best... Don't bother paying for video that was free on many tvs and for good reason"
5,Fruitcake Lady is HILARIOUS!!,"If you don't love this lady, you don't have a pulse. You will laugh your tail off. DEFINITELY worth the download price for these videos."
2,Better than nothing,"This is a terrible reproduction. The sound quality is awful. The CD I made from the capture of my scratchy old vinyl is better than this. Sound is muddy. Mid-range is totally missing and the high end is not far behind. If all you want is drums (and I mean drums, because the cymbols don't show up for much) then this is it.Too bad, because this is a great album. Deserves better treatment than this. A remaster would be good."
5,...Only if you want to Hear Great Musicians...!,"If you want to hear what Jazz Fusion is all about, then this is must have album. Lenny White's masterful playing of syncopated rhythms with a hard driving bass licks are unparalleled. His hand speed and sense of rhythm are superior and his drum beat ideas are just like no other drummer I've heard. Most seasoned drummers who studied jazz and fusion recognize Mr. White as one of the all time greatest drummers...He was just ahead of his time. This album rocks with Nick Moroch on Guitar (one of the greatest) and Don Blackman on keyboards and I forget the bass players name but believe me...he kicks ass. You won't be disappointed. Not sure of the sound quality on the CD as i have the Original LP which is rich and full. Many times CD's loose the sound quality during the transfer, but I'm sure it will still be good."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed this recording. The guitar work is inspiring, as are the drums. Heavy Metal Monster is one of my favs and is a great metallic guitar track. The overall theme of the album resounds through each piece, which provides a nice warm, yet spacey trip. Alot of reviews point to a Billy Cobham imitation, but I find if I just take the recording for what it is, the beauty becomes very apparent. Listen as a listener, not as a critic, and your ears will show you the way."
3,Brilliant or boring,"Some great examples of prose poems in here,with real energy and power, and then some snoozers. I guess I want every one of them to thrill me in some way, and they don't. The good ones, though, justify the investment."
4,A good book about Smallvilles third season.,"The book ist well structured and contains interesting information about the characters on the show and the actors themselves. Also the episodes are explained in a comprehensive way , so that the storylines become understandable even to those people who are not Smallville addicted ones yet. These days I own all the three companion books about Smallvilles Season One to three, which I purchased from amazon.com online.I like these books a lot and have almost completed them one by one. The three official companions can only be recommended ! I`m already looking forward to The official Companion Season 4 by Craig Byrne, which I hope will contain coloured pictures. THats why I rated this item with only four stars and not five. In the first three companions all the pictures where in black and white, besides a coloured photo gallery ( the actors ) in the middle of each book."
4,Decidedly worth it for fans,"Titan Books does an excellent job summing up the Smallville seasons in all their books, and this third one was no exception. The cast quotes are well chosen and informative, and the behind-the-scenes anecdotes are always amusing. Certainly worth picking up if you're a fan of the show."
1,cookbook stand kept falling over,"I tried this. It looks real nice but with a big book on it, it becomes front heavy and it tips, colpases and falls over. I returned it. It would have been better if the back was anchored out so it would not collapse when bearely bumped or touched."
1,Wow...,"I bought this thinking it would look elegant in my black and white kitchen and also be useful in holding my cookbook when I use it. I was very disappointed in what arrived. Not only is it not really black (it's more of an iron / rust color) but it arrived damaged. One of the chain balls was crushed. When I called to set up an exchange, the customer service rep could have cared less what I said and questioned me in regards to handleing it. The customer service rep was NOT an Amazon rep - just wanted to make that clear. It's one of the vendors. Anyway - I got another one in better condition, but the package it came in held a lot of paint chips. I'm looking into spray painting it black, but that's not really the point.It does tip over like the previous poster said.PICK SOMETHING ELSE! Save yourself some frustration..."
1,Ye Gods....,"Imagine if John Tesh composed music...oh wait, unfortunately you don't have to imagine. Well, Einaudi's muzak is of a similar caliber. All it needs is a track of waves crashing on the shore and seagulls cawing to complete this somnolescent mush of insipid pabulum. This man studied with Berio?!!?!?!? Seriously, if anyone compares Einaudi to Part or Reich within earshot, slap them. Good and hard."
3,Le Onde,Product arrival was fast and as described. I guess I am getting burned out on this artist as I was dissapointed with his presentations.
5,Great photographs,"The photographs in this book are worth the price of it. If you're a Kubrick fan, you can't do without it. The photographs teach more about film than a dozen histories."
3,Sheds some light on Kubrick but does not stand alone as photography,"The editors of this book were wise in prominently placing the photo that you see here on the cover. It is the most distinct and mysterious image in a book of otherwise indistinct work. Most of the photos are commercial and are interesting in so far as they reveal little hints of Kubrick's budding genius for mis-en-scene. But as photos the work doesn't stand alone very well, nor was it intended to."
3,GERMAN TECHNO DANCE MUSIC,"80'S TECHNO-DANCE music. The drums are heavy and similar to Laibach on the first song. But make no mistake they are not Laibach.The vocals are at times unintelligible screams associated with this style of music. When you can make out the lyrics they have a heavy German accent. The last song on the first side is simply silly as the vocals imitate the sound of an elderly woman, most likely the Frau on the J cover, one that doesn't include lyricS. They do better when they play straight industrial dance than when they try to get cute."
3,WARNING NOT AN OFFICIAL MICROSOFT PRODUCT,"The hard drive arrived in a sketchy cardboard box. This product was not created by Microsoft instead it is a Chinese 3rd party reproduction. However, given the fact that the hard drive works completely fine with the old model Xbox 360 i have given it 3 stars. Defiantly not Microsoft Certified. At least it works fine."
1,Sent Faulty products,I received my hard drive from this seller in August. I bought a transfer cable around the same time used. My xbox system didn't recognize the hard drive so I just bought a new cable. The xbox system still doesn't recognize the hard drive making it a corrupted hard drive.
4,A must need for your Xbox 360,Why have the small 20gb HD when you can go with this 120 gb it seams small but it holds a lot a stuff great item.
5,Slim compatable,This is compatable with the slim. you just take the actual hard drive out of the case and plug it in the xbox. it is easy.
1,Came earlier than expected but...,"When I received this product, it came in a cheap Made In China box, and when I took it out it was wrapped in bubble wrap and looked at the label in the back of the hard drive, it was surely made in China. The port where the hard drive goes into the xbox slot was unbalanced and loose, and I tried several times to correctly click it in to my xbox where the hard drive should be and it would not go. The hard drive itself was noticeably taken apart and screwed back together as if there was something wrong with it, and they had to fix it, when I ordered this product as New. I bought this from Bestumart. If anyone knows where I can buy an ACTUAL Microsoft 120GB Hard drive for the Xbox 360, please tell me."
5,great,I have not had any problems with this hard drive my friends like the fact that its bigger then the one they have and want to get one.
5,Memorrific,So much space. My husband is gamer and he still has plenty of space. He loves this. Totally worth it.
4,Overpriced but a good addition,"I was fortunate enough to find one of these on clearance (probably a mistake) at a local Target for $95.00 which is still the cheapest price I have seen for a new one from a retailer (non-ebay). It came with the transfer kit and I had all of my information from my 20Gb hard drive swapped over in no time. It has been flawless since I have bought it and has a ton of storage space. This is really needed now as I play all of my games now off of the hard drive. It is much quieter than having the disc spinning. I have 4 or 5 games installed, several demo's, the Netflix application and saved game information, several map packs and themes. After all of that I have over 70gb still available. I have not ripped any music to my drive yet but that is next. I would suggest picking one of these up but its a real shame that Microsoft won't get the price of this drive down as it is price gouging up where it is now. That is the only reason I could not give it 5 stars."
4,"Great item, but a bit pricey.","This item is great and it really helps to expand your XBOX360 memory capacity. If only for Rock Band and GH Tracks alone, this item is necessary. You can also install the games to your hard drive to nearly eliminate load times and lag.The price tag is a bit high, but it IS Microsoft - what did you expect? If you're near full capacity, make the upgrade and buy this unit. You won't be sorry."
4,Best Used HarddriveI ever spent aproxamitly $90 on.,"You need one of these for your 360 to download game demos save things, music movies, games whatever, this is the largest size offered by microsoft unless you hack a bigger harddrive into the unit but you might brick your system or get banned from live. 4 stars because I think what I paid should be the new price, not $[...]"
2,Okay MS Enough is enough,"I think this product has been on the market long enough to warrant a price drop, or at least a little third part competition. When I can get the same amount of memory for my PS3 for 60 bucks or less, this just doesn't seem like any kind of value to early 360 adopters."
2,Careful,"Before I purchased my hard drIve I was under the impression that it was going to be new and come with a transfer kit. When I got it, it was the hard drive from an elite just wrapped in bubble wrap and no transfer kit. So I had to go out of my way to find a transfer kit before I could even use my hard drive. It works fine it's just I doubt it was new."
3,"Needed upgrade, but overpriced","Going from 20Gb to 120Gb makes the Xbox 360 far more usable for people who are ripping large game libraries to the HDD, downloading tons of videos, and so on.[...]"
2,XBOX 360 HARD DRIVE,"I bought this item for my grandson.He was so exicted to start playing games on his xbox.The problem started when he could not play older versions of his games.His parents called Microsft xbox and they were told that because it was not purchased from microsoft they could not help him.This hard drive will not play older versions of xbox games and the reasons given is that it is an older type of harddrive possibly from a laptop that replaced the original hard drive,but it will play newer games.Anyone purchasing this item should go to google and see the scams that go on with this harddrive.I had no idea but I hope this helps someone who is about to buy from a third party vendor through AMAZON"
3,XBOX 360 120GB Hard Drive,"The good: Cheaper price than a retail store, which is good. No tax, good. works, good.The bad: Microsoft has a proprietary hard drive so they over-charge for what is considered a minimal space hard drive. I could buy a 1 TB hard drive for this price, if the 360 wasn't proprietary. Shame on Microsoft for raping us on the price."
3,This should've been on the XBOX 360 from the start,"I think the 120GB Hard Drive should've been on the XBOX 360 since it launched. I had an XBOX 360 since launch day and the 20GB that it came with was too small, considering that half of the space was already used for system software.Of course, Microsoft will try and cash-in with accessories that should've come with the console by default - like the wireless network adapter.I had to get one of these cause I was running out of HD space. I'm giving it 3 stars since it is somewhat necessary for every XBOX 360 gamer to have it but taking out 2 stars cause of the price and for the fact that it's something that should have came with the console at launch."
3,"Great Product, Horrid Price","This is a great option for the 360 for storage. It took about 20min to transfer my 20gb hard drive (almost full) to the new. The only drawback to this item is the price. Microsoft REALLY needs to fix the price point on this item. You can buy a 2 terabyte hd for your computer for the same price as this. I thought maybe I'll save the money by getting a used one...but no...I needed the transfer cable to get all my stuff off the old hard drive, and no one includes it in a used deal. So again this review is simple as in the title...Product 5 stars.....Price 2 stars."
2,Micro-con,"When I bought my xbox360 and found out the largest hard drive was a 20 GB I thought that there was no logic behind that. It was too small to do all of the things Xbox 360 and live offer. Now with the release of this hard drive I understand. They had to know that 20 GB would make people want more and now they present them with it at the ""give us your first born"" price of nearly $180 (all for 120 GB). I am a fan of downloaded shows, games, and music to go along with my gaming. Therefore...the 120 is a dream. However, not at that ridiculous price tag. It is almost like buying another Xbox 360 just for **** and giggles. I feel like micro-con is trying to bleed the current Xbox fan dry. Then they will introduce the new 360 baby implant to bring around a whole new generation of customers."
2,Microsoft set a rip off item!,$180 bucks for a massive HD is just wrong. You can get a brand new PSP for the same money. Bill Gates is a nut job.
1,Xbox 360 120GB HD,This was a cheap knock off and I had to send it back. I ordered the real deal 250 GB one and love it.
3,120GB still isnt enough,"Microsoft needs to release a larger HDD. For gamers with lots of games who want to install them, this works but will quickly run out. Games on average are around 6GB, considering you dont even get all 120GB available to you (107GB after the system reserves some), you wont be instralling 20 games without taking up the whole thing. I do not understand how Microsoft justifies charging what they do for 120GB dirves either considering they are nothing more than notebook HDD's with MS firmware. Just to put it in perspective, you can get a 120GB Western Digital(what MS uses as their HDD's) for around $50. Whats even worse is that you can get a 500GB 2.5"" drive for about $90. Thats four times the space for a cheaper price. This is one area where the PS3 beats the 360 hands down. My PS3 has four times the storage space for less because Sony lets you use standard 2.5"" notebook hard drives. Seriously MS, if your going to make us use proprietary drives, at least price them properly."
3,How much???!,"I can buy a terabtye of storage online now for less than this 120G drive costs. This is just a huge rip-off, that is a required upgrade for those that bought the slimmed-down, no-hard-drive version of the xbox if they want to do things like use much of the downloadable content, use netflix on their xbox, or a variety of other tasks the 360 is capable of.The device itself is great; but the price strongly indicates that microsft is fleecing their customers here."
1,Ridiculous Price??,"I was looking at the best option to getting a 360 and I was thinking about just getting the arcade with a hdd. I expected for it to be overpriced around 100 or something because it is M$, but this is just ridiculous. I upgraded my PS3's HDD to 500GB for less than $80. Why is this one almost $100 dollars MORE for 380GB LESS. That is just plain ridiculous!!"
3,Not an official Microsoft Harddrive.,"Xbox 360 120GB Hard DriveWhile the drive works, it is NOT an Official Microsoft drive.The item listing states ""Xbox 360 120GB Hard Drive by Microsoft"" which is false. I don't play any original Xbox games on my 360 so I do not know if this drive would suffer from not having the emulation software on the drive, like so many other third party drives.I'm not complaining as this is for a secondary Xbox 360 primarily used as a media center."
1,Not a real Microsoft Xbox 360 drive.,This product was not a real Microsoft Xbox 360 drive. It was / is missing some of the needed partitions for the drive to be seen by the Xbox 360 as a drive instead of a USB drive.
2,Fake,The pros about my order was i received it early and it works for now. The cons are it looks like a fake because the chrome on the side isnt even on there and its flimsy so i dont know if i should keep it or return it.
1,Re-f'in-diculous,"I initially became interested in hard drive expansion because I keep running out of space. I had downloaded all the Dead Space animated comics (pretty cool btw) but each of them are pretty hefty in size. I have a couple Xbox Originals stored on there and some demos of upcoming games I want to play etc. I figured I could grab some extra storage for around $75. I thought ""Hey, it's just a proprietary drop-in hard drive. It can't be that expensive...""Holy crap this is outrageous! Let me put this into perspective: For a mere $120 more you can buy a completely new xbox 360 pro. Granted it'll have 100g less storage capacity, but I find it hard to believe that this little hard drive costs over half as much as it does for an entire 360 system with controller. Seriously, I'll save the money and just delete stuff and redownload it when I want to play/watch it."
4,Be aware that it's NOT black,"Just letting everyone know that even though the picture shows the hard drive as being black, it is not. I got the HD from Amazon thinking that they offer the black one, but that is not the case."
2,"Nice Hard Drive, but Moving the Data is a Task!","It is wonderful having the extra hard drive space, but to transfer data from you old hard drive to your new drive, can be a chore. ...and no one enjoys chores. My external Memory Card that is inserted in the front of the Xbox 360, is not of significant size.It would have been wonderful of either Microsoft or Amazon to share (or suggest) that you should also purchase a sizable memory card to help with the transference of your current drive's data to the new drive.I did attempt to buy a memory card, but being the day after Christmas 2009 is when I purchased my new hard drive, each and every store I called was SOLD OUT of sizable memory cards.After the data transference was finally completed, the hard drive performs as you would expect a compatible hard drive to perform. It would be my suggestion that everyone obtain a large hard drive, but also buy a sizable memory card."
2,Having trouble,"First I had a hard time trying to figure out what I wanted in a hard drive. Then when my son opened it up on Christmas morning, we discovered it was the wrong one. I sent it back but haven't heard anything on whether I'll get my money back or what. I'm not too happy about having to return it and what I went through to return it and the amount of time it's taking to hear back from the company."
4,Badly Needed Storage.,"You have no idea how fast you can fill up your storage space. Not even 120GB is enough space for the stuff you save or download. I already have well over 30GB used up and have had it for less than a month.The only problem I have right now is that it seems a couple of my maps (The ones that or on the disk) for Call of Duty 2 seem to be corupted some how, after I tranferd every thing from the 20GB to the 120GB drive..."
3,"It works, however, it's not quite what I'd expected..","In all honesty, this probably isn't official Microsoft hardware, but rather a 120GB computer HDD fitted and formatted onto an Xbox mount and case, and then plastered with a ""120GB"" sticker. It works, but its lack of quality craftsmanship showed the moment I opened up the box. The back portion of the hard drive got torn out of its place during the shipping process, rendering it.. difficult to mount to my system. Luckily, the hard drive still functions, and I'm able to save and load as usual, and I do feel like I got a fairly decent price, but it should most certainly be mentioned somewhere that this product isn't quite up to par with the one Microsoft is offering, and that's why there's a price difference."
3,Didn't work,"it might have been this particular hard drive, but the costumer service was excellent. Didn't work on any xbox i tried it on."
3,360 hard drive 120GB,The good:Hard drive was easy to install. Came with cable and software to transfer data from original 360 hard drive to this one.The bad:Expensive for only a 120 GB.It took an hour to transfer data from a 12 GB drive (had about 11 GB on it).Cannot use original hard drive after the transfer of data (only 1 drive at a time can be used with the xbox 360).
4,120 GB HDD,Pros: Never have to delete anything. Plenty of space for everything.Cons: Expensive even at 140 dollars.Other thoughts: Still waiting for Microsoft's Xbox 360-based IPTV.
3,Other user was on key,Had to manually delete over 100 filesNot very good at staying connected to the Xbox system and a little lag
5,Xbox 360 120 GB Hard Drive Rocks!,"I am very happy with the huge amount of memory now available to me. I can stop worrying about how many of my friends have profiles on my hard drive, how much music I have stored on it, how many games I may have to delete in the future, etc. Now, maybe I'll start putting movies on it..."
3,Had Issues,I tried dozens of times to get this to work. I tried just about everything. After I deleted all the saves for Viva pinata It worked fine. but I lost my lvl 35 gardan so i was not happy about that.
5,"Although Refurb, this product worked perfectly and I got it for cheap!","The hard drive was black, which was not what it was in the picture, but the product did work perfectly and for a lot cheaper than you would find it in target or something."
1,Works well. Standard Harddrive. Ridiculously OverPriced.,"2.5"" Mobile Hard Drives run around $39.99 if not cheaper. How does Microsoft get off charging almost $100 more? Oh thats right it's because they don't give you another option."
2,The other side of Zion,"What's good about glorifying an independance when hundred thousands of people were forced to leave their homes to let the new comers (european jews) settle down and feel ""free"" ? I guess that's a new concept of independance."
5,Just the job,I researched the replacement part thoroughly (so that I was getting like for like) for my oil fired heating system and this worked perfectly.
3,Okay,It's not quite what I had expected but with some adjustments I can use it for my Sunday school class.
4,Awesome learning tool to a very complicated game!,"Finally, there's a video out that comprehensively describes what Pokemon is all about and how to play. My girls had no idea how to play and after seeing these tapes they're well on their way! Having never been to a tournament, they really enjoyed seeing how its played. THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO SET, you're kids will love it!!!"
5,I'd rate this a 1 in 1999 but in 2012...,"Unofficial sensationalist ""insider"" VHS tapes were a mainstream thing in the late 90's and early 00's, and everything had them. Pokemon, Harry Potter, etc. I bought a copy of these tapes (and its sequel) about a decade after their release because I was looking for something hilarious to make fun of, and this was a literal goldmine. The content hasn't aged well at all, and it's readily apparent. The production values are terrible, the personalities of the people behind the camera are still, awkward, and laughable, and the background music, well, don't get me started on it. If you're paying more than a couple of bucks for this 2-tape set you're getting ripped off, otherwise pony up the cash and enjoy the show. With the right kind of party atmosphere you will laugh your ass off."

2,Asking for forgiveness on behalf of Mary Queen of Scotts,"Queen Mary was not an intelligent woman... She was carried away by her passion, feelings, desires... She has never been a true and competent ruler... She was just a tool for Catholics to be played against Protestants... However, the heroine in Antonia Fraser's book is an underestimated leader betrayed by all and all her mistakes she committed are the faults of others and of her naivité... What is the truth then?... Is the truth what the history says or what a biased writer says?"
1,A review of a book paid for but not received,I received this request but never the book. Will someone at Amazon send me my book or my money back.......
4,Mary Queen of Scott: A Review,"Mary Queen of Scots captures the essence and identity of a nation as a child, young woman, wife, mother, queen, and diplomat. Antonia Fraser chronologically captures the life of Mary Stuart without subjectivity in a definitive work of specificity. Fraser ignored the dating complications from the sixteenth century to provide a modern biographical reader that may be read and comprehended by anyone possessing the skill of reading."
2,lots of detail and some peculiar conclusions,"Fraser's biography seems to be the product of lots of admirable research. I'm impressed by her access to original source materials, as well as by her attempts to synthesize the details she gathers from them into a coherent story of Mary's life. But the conclusions she draws often seem sentimental and unrealistic. On more than one occasion, she corroborates information about a person's behavior with some folkloric history of the temperament known to run in his or her family. It sounds like someone's great aunt gossiping about an errant niece, and had to seem just as inappropriate to an historical biography in 1969 as it does today. Moreover, while she only wrote the book in the late 1960s, the author's own social views show through strongly and seem strangely out-of-date or even prudish in the early 21st century.The wealth of detail and the story they describe are satisfying in themselves, but someone else might have told this story to better effect."
4,With cousins like this...,"A richly researched book that the history enthusiast will want to read. This book takes much concentration, but I enjoyed contrasting it with Margaret George's fictional account about Mary. Some of the differences are interesting. Whichever you prefer -- this fact-filled work-- or the easier reading fiction, Mary's life was indeed stranger than fiction. She was a fascinating woman, and this book leaves supplies all the detail you'll ever want to know."
3,Very good telling of one of Britain's best Royal stories.,"Frasier does a very good job of research, and convincingly agrees and disagrees with scholars who have gone over this subject before. She makes keen observations about not only her subject, but about the evidence used against her.Mary was the wrong woman at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was her sin. I wonder where she would have ended up had she not put so much stock in Elizabeth to treat her honorably.It is worth noting that the film, Mary Queen of Scots, made in the early 7os, has a couple of egregious historical errors. But that's Hollywood...or should I say....Hollyrood."
3,"Entertaining, but biased book about the Scottish Queen","Antonia Fraser's book, Mary Queen of Scots, is very readable and entertaining. However, the author's ""hero-worship"" of Mary and low opinion of English Queen Elizabeth I rings out loud and clear. Fraser makes history come alive; just be aware that this is her version of history."
3,Brave but flawed effort,"If this book were a disseratation, I'd give it full marks for being fully researched, almost to the point of overkill. The problem is that Ms. Fraser is a bit too much in love with her subject for the book's own good--and this is perhaps not suprising, given that Mary was one who did inspire extreme feelings of either love or loathing. My own hunch is that Mary, in common with any number of other Stuart monarchs, would have made a delightful dinner guest but, as ruler, proves that a good judicious mix of Plantagenet, Tudor and, yes, even Windsor qualities actually gets the work done."
5,there was never a more class act than steve goodman,I played the old 33 until I wore it out. so many artists come together to make this catalogue complete. John Prine's liner notes say it all!
3,McCreesh has failed in a religious interpretation,"The performance is theatrical. It is boring after ""Thy rebuke hath broken His heart""(the second part). It seems, that McCreesh has failed in a religious interpretation.""Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion""(the first part) by Dorothea Röschmann(soprano) is performed well. The chorus is not bad.Recorded in 1996."
3,Mostly useful,"Nice little packet of thingamabobs. Mostly useful for wrangling cables, but a few of the pieces have seemingly limited utility.But for the money, they're passable. Nice to have little things to keep cords out of the way. Would probably buy again."
4,Belkin Cable Control Clips,Sturdy parts- good for computer cable control. Shipped very quickly even though it was at the hopis time. Durable parts very- good price.
3,not very sticky for sticky clips,"The paper with the adhesive is separate from the clips. You have to position the paper on the clip and then pull off a paper to reveal the sticky side. That would be OK, but I used 4 medium clips to hold my shaver wires in the bathroom and all have fallen off. Probably good for everywhere else, I have not tried yet."
3,China meets Japan,"Nice family film, which is rare for a flick from this genre. I would definitely recommend it. The storyline can be applied to in modern kungfu films of today."
2,vhs to dvd???,This dvd looks like it was taken from a vhs tape. very poor quality on all four movies. TERRIBLE!!! I will keep my sinister cinema dvd of Black Mamba and my interglobal vhs of Castle of the walking dead because they are much better quality.
2,"watery, there are better lotions out there",pretty disappointed with the results from this lotion but i did not use it in it's 2 step formula with karma. the lotion was runny and watery which made it hard to apply and turned me orange at first. there are way better lotions out there!
2,Good concept. Poor execution.,"This seemed like a good idea as a substitute for blankets, which often get kicked off by the baby. However, the design is not that good and it just doesn't work the way it should. I should mention that the fleece knot hats made by Teddytoes (which I bought at the same time as this item) are great!"
3,RUNAWAY CLOCK,"What do you do with a clock that keeps advancing one minute each second? That's what happens when I use the ""sleep"" feature. Then, to correct the time, you have to press the time button through 24 hours...and if you over-correct...OOPS...press another 24 hours. There is no backward time adjustment. It's not cost-effective to send it back for replacement...so I just cannot use the ""sleep"" feature. Otherwise, the large display is great for us myopics. The radio is very adequate, and the alarm is LOUD! I like the radio...I just wish I was able to fall asleep to music."
2,Big Display but Very Clunky,"The only reason I keep this clock is for display reasons in the living room. First of all, the alarm buttons are in a place that makes it difficult to press down. You have to actually pick up the entire clock to set the alarm with the buttons because the way it is set up, there is no leverage when try to press the buttons. Two, its not very intuitive where the alarm on/off buttons are. It took me about 30 seconds to find the off button each morning when I used it as an alarm clock. That can get annoying if the person next to you isn't waking up with you. Third, the radio quality is so poor. I like to wake to music, but all I got was static. Yes, the display is nice, but you can find better clocks for cheaper if all you want is the display. That's my 2-cents."
3,This prod. should also be available in Europe incl Finlad,A very compact simple digital alarm clock with darkening numbers should be available. Usually the numbers are too bright in the middle of the night. A simple clock wihout radio would definitely sell.
3,A unique book that focuses on unique issues,'Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont' certainly does not deserve the obscurity it has been languishing in .It is a clear and well-written book that focuses on the loneliness and loss of dignity of the elderly treated with just the correct does of sentimentality and humour .I would recommend the book strongly for it is written with a lot of heart and a strong understanding of human nature
5,Pleased with Palfrey,Delightful sketches of aging gracefully. Sentimental life review with heartwarming coping/adjustments to the present and anticipated future.
3,"Mrs. Palfrey, Rich character study","Rich, full characters flesh out this dismal tale. Definitely not the standard American story, no happy ending this."
3,Reading for pure enjoyment,"I must admit that I saw the movie version of ""Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont"" and love it, so I decided to read the book. I usually find the book much better, however, in this case, I wanted it to read like the movie and it didn't. It is bitter-sweet and well done, but the relationships on screen were richer than the ones in the book. Perhaps the book was more true to life, but I read non-fiction for that experience."
2,Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont,"I luckily saw the movie version of this first - a well-acted, sweet movie. I bought the DVD as I enjoyed it so much. I decided to buy the book too and read it after having seen the movie twice. A big disappointment which surprised me - I usually enjoy the book version of a movie more, more content, etc. But the character portrayals on film were much softer and all in all the film was kinder, sweeter. I was quite disappointed in the book and would recommend anyone wishing to buy it, to buy the DVD instead. A lovely film."
1,Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont,"The possiblity was there to have done more with the characters. I felt rushed through a story that I would have rather taken my time, and enjoyed getting to know Mrs Palfrey and her extended family better."
5,Christmas Memories-Bill Medley,"If you are looking for a Christmas CD but not done in the usual way but the Bill Medley way, this is for you. His voice and the Medley touch to some Christmas favorites are Righteous and beautiful and the best song is the one he and his daughter, McKenna, do together and at the end what they ""say"" to each other is very heart warming. If you are a Righteous Brothers, Bill Medley fan then you must have this in your collection, I listen to it in the other months of the year not just Nov. and Dec. Merry Christmas the Bill Medley way."
4,Clever Sequel,"This is a clever sequel to the Goldilocks & the 3 Bears fairy tale. It is as much fun for the adult to read as for the children to hear. Goldilocks is now a middle aged woman who runs a store called ""Goldie's Locks and Keys"". She is racked with guilt for the trouble she caused the 3 bears so long ago and sets out to repair the damage she had caused. The bears aren't so enthusiastic about her return this time either. I enjoyed reading it and the illustrations are great. My 3 1/2 yr old daughter didn't catch all the inside jokes, but a 4 to 5 year old probably would."
3,The Sequel to a Famous Story,"Goldilocks Returns explains the story of what happened after that curious curly-haired girl had trespassed onto the property of the three bears. Of course, she grew up and ended up pinning her curls and opening up a lock shop for a living. However, despite all she has done to try and put it behind her, Goldi can still never forgive herself for going into the bears house all of those years ago. So, fifty years later, Goldi has a plan to try and make things right. Find out what happens in this sequel to one of the most well-known stories ever."
5,An eloquent memoir & instructional advice by a birth mother.,"As a Korean adopted woman who was adopted into the U.S. in the 1960s, I also experienced similar but different shame & secrecy that muffles & stifles members of the adoption triad. I commend Ms. Franklin's courage & willingness to share her story of loss & triumph, so that others may learn & understand birth mothers, adoptees & also adoptive parents in the adoption triad experience. I hope that Ms. Franklin will continue writing, speaking & educating others about the joy & love, as well as the pain, sorrow & loss of adoption."
2,this book is too superficial and badly written,"The only reason I give this book even two stars is that it's written by a birth mother, which is pretty unusual. Unfortunately, we do not get enough of her own and her son's stories; it is not a memoir. Neither is it a well-researched informational book about adoption. The information it contains is pretty superficial. (To give an idea, the author cites People magazine for the earth-shattering news that some foreign-born adoptees are now searching for their roots.) It's also not very well-written: despite her boast that ``literature and language have always been part of my life'' as a translator and publisher, the author comes across as not only stilted but downright ungrammatical. In short, I found this book a boring read and not worth the effort. Too bad, because there aren't many books out there from the birth mother's perspective."
3,Disappointing,This book was disappointing. I was expecting it to detail LGBT life in South Asia in a more anthropological way. Instead it is just a bunch of pop culture references.
4,Hate and Love: The Equalizng Forces in Motherhood,"Although this volume was first published in 1997, the concepts are still bracingly cogent and essential to current thinking about the development of healthy attachment. The contributors examine the effects of intra-psychic and literal interdependency within the mother/child dyad, and how the concurrent experience of love and hate forms the potential for intimacy and autonomy. This thorough and lively investigation of inter-subjective dynamics is then overlaid with the external dynamism of social and economic factors. Altogether this collection provides stimulation and new insight."
4,Good Lunch Bag,Nice bag. Lots of room. Nicely insulated bottom part. Zippers have to be handled carefully though. Until they break in somewhat they are very easily snagged and stuck.
5,nice,"nice roomy lunchbox with multiple storage areas. carry strap, room for ice pack. this always comes with us on trips to museums and the aquarium. lots of food can go in here!"
5,Awesome product,I love it. I can put cold things in the bottom part and things that do not need to be cold in the top part. It is also great that I can put silverware or plastic in the front flap. very versitile.
4,Lunch Tote Review,"The only thing I think its missing is a screened pouch to hold the freezer gel pack. Other than that, I like it, plus everybody at work thinkls it cool because they have never seen a lunch bag with silver ware"
5,Great versatile lunch box!,I bought this the other week when I decided I was going to start packing my lunch for work. I never buy the average product so I looked around and found this. I loved the fact that it came with utensiles. Saw a few reviews that said it was to large but I don't feel that is the case. The bottom part is the perfect size for my ice pack and other food that I want to keep cool. I would deffinatley recomend it!
4,Very nice lunch bag!,"I'm a guy who was looking for a bigger lunch bag to bring to the office. This bag is wonderful, and I know I can store my a sandwich, drink, fruit, and a late morning/afternoon snack. It holds everything well, and the bag keeps everything nicely insulated.It is important to know that this is more of a picnic bag based on its size, and it'd easily fit another food for another person if you're looking to have a picnic with your honey.If you don't have ice packs and are in an office environment, as this bag is big, it is doubtful it will fit comfortably in an office fridge.The utensils provided are very nice, but the napkin is a bit difficult seeing as it does need to be washed. The salt and pepper shaker are certainly cheaply made, as it seems like one of the lids on the shakers won't stay closed. Good thing I don't keep these in the bag, otherwise it could be a big mess.Based on all of these, I give this bag 4/5 stars."
4,Exactly What I Expected,"This is perfect for work! It holds a three-item rectangular frozen dinner with plenty of room for other items (and that's just the bottom compartment). The upper compartment easily holds a couple of drinks, a dessert, and and various napkins, pens, a toothbrush, etc. The silverware is high-quality, and I really like the zippered pouch."
4,Almost perfect,"Very good product!Solid, good looking, complete and it keeps the cold/hot inside. The only problem are the zippers. I've been using this product for a couple weeks now and I have some problems with them. Nothing serious for now but who knows... So far so good!All in short, a must buy!"
5,Great Lunch Box w/ everything you need!,"I use this lunch box everyday for work. It has three separate sections. One on top for uninsulated things, a large section on the bottom for insulated items and a small section in front for the fork, knife, spoon, napkin and salt and pepper shakers that come with the unit. Everything you need at your fingertips. Have lunch anywhere! I am a dispatcher and have to eat lunch at my console. I have everything I need in one box to enjoy my lunch between calls. This is the best lunchbox I have ever owned. It is so handy!!"
4,Great Size,"This is a great size. I plan to keep it next to my desk since the insulation is so good. I like the addition of the salt and pepper shakers, Napkin, fork, spoon and knife. Good for the enviornment."
3,It's decent (not great) quality but it is too large as lunch box!,"I was looking for a quality lunch box to take to work. Read the reviews and got sold on the look and quality. Also saw the complains that it's too large but it didn't register!If you are looking to carry 1-2 small food containers plus maybe a fruit, even the bottom compartment is too large. The fork/knife/spoon/salt/pepper shaker and napkin are cute but are typical Chinese quality. The look is Ok also but I have seen better.Even if it was the right size for my application, I would still give it 3.5 stars due to quality.Bottom line - as the title says"" Decent (not great) quality but it is too large!"
4,"Nice, roomy, but stinks","I bought this for my fiance' to take to lunch and he hasn't been able to use it yet. We've had it for over 3 weeks now and it stinks so bad I am afraid his lunch will absorb the smell. Wreaks of formaldehyde so bad! We've had it airing outside for the last week now in the hot sun and through rain and it still smells! It's ridiculous that such chemicals are used on everything these days and so strongly that it hasn't even aired out yet almost a month later!So for anyone like myself with Multiple Chemical Sensitivities or Asthma be warned! This will take quite some time to air out outside or in a room you don't go in, so be prepared to NOT have it even though you ""have"" it. So frustrating! Please start making things not so toxic!!!"
4,Lunch Tote for Silent Auction item,went into a silent auction recently after having read a positive review on someone's blog and thought this would sell well.
2,Picnic Time Lunch Bag,"Looks like a good bag at first, until you look at the back side stitching. Looks terrible. Also in the top compartment are two stain lines in the fabric that rubbed out, but looks like something square-like may have been stored inside like a container or something, just not sure. I have reason to believe this is a second or third quality lunch bag. Probably the 1st quality is sold directly in the retail store not through amazon.com. I have never seen lunch bags in any price range in any retail stores with poor stictching on the back side bag like this. I am beginning to be more cautious of what I bag. Another thing It says it is made in China. I am sick and tired of China garbage products. Next time I will pay more and only buy USA made."
5,Amazing,By far my favorite pen. Very smooth and fine writing. Anyone that has borrowed one from me has loved them as well. I would strongly recommend to anyone!
4,My Second Favorite,"So if you are looking for super fine pens that do NOT bleed through the page, these are probably them. However, I have had some troubles with maybe 1 in 10 of the pens where it just doesn't write well for whatever reason...some ink dispensing problem. Also, I don't get as much writing out of one pen as I would like. I take a lot of notes as a university student and one of these guys doesn't last too long when you're filling notebooks on a regular basis.On that note, if you adore these but want a longer lasting, better quality pen, you must go to muji.com and order the .38mm gel ink ball point pen. They are more expensive, but I think the ink lasts a lot longer, and the color pallette is wonderfully extensive, which is hard to find while still fulfilling such specific pen criterion!"
1,Pens,"First time you made a mistake, you send the wrong pens, wanted 0.5,but recieved 0.3, makes it very hard to figure out how to exchange."
3,Not all that it's hyped up to be,"After using the Pilot .38 mm's for a few months, I decided to give Uniball a shot. Overall, it's an elegant pen. What I noticed immediately from switching was how light it was. This is all a matter of personal preference, but the Pilot G2 gave me a more solid writing feel. I got used to this in a few months though. After using a pen for a few days, however, it stopped writing. I checked the ink levels and they were still half way full. Thinking I must have got a lemon, I grabbed another pen, and within 2 days, it too, failed on me on moderate use. As a college student, I take a 10-20 pages of notes a day and work through a few problem sets in pen. At a little under 2 bucks a pen, this is a bit of a disappointment."
4,Writes great but doesn't last long,"These pens are awesome... they make very neat, fine lines but the ink is nice and dark. I used to use Pilot G2 but these write much more smoothly and consistently. There was one pen in my box that was scratchy and kept skipping, but I didn't have a single problem with the other pens.Positives: very dark ink, very fine line, doesn't smear, writes smoothly, no ink globs, you don't have to hold it at a weird angle or press hard to get it to writeNegative: VERY little ink in these... one pen lasts me only 2 weeks!"
4,Not as good as the Pilot G2,"I'd been using the Pilot G2 almost exclusively for the last six years or so and switched from the .5mm to the .38mm without looking back. I wanted to try another micro point pen and found these on Amazon. They are definitely a good competitor to the G2 but don't put out as much ink as the Pilot pens which accounts for my 4/5 star rating. They are not as consistent in their ink flow and if you have a heavy hand when you write, this may not be the best choice. It's got a great grip however and the shape is pleasant to hold. I only wish it offered the same ink flow as the Pilot G2 and it'd be my new go-to pen."
5,A Page Turner!!,"This book is about a story of 4 friends (Dez, Benny, Nick and Tee) who have lived in the same neighborhood since they were young but have had different walks of life. Though this story line is common and many can relate, this book is definitely a page turner. The date thing is not noticeable and then WOW, but I remembered!! Great story and I would recommend this book. Thank you Mr. E. Lemont Goode Jr. for a great story!!!~Susan~Member of Savvy Sistahs Book Club"
2,You want a cheap CD Player? You got it...,"I was on a tight budget when my otherwise reliable CD player (A MagnaVox) of 3 years died on me. I bought this one because I needed a cheap CD player with skip protection and a car adapter. I found the car adapter did not work, however, and so used my old one. The skip protection , moreover, is slow and fails frequently - often with little or no reason. In addition, it occasionally stops working for no apparent reason. As one final gripe, the sound quality is pretty mediocre (especially with the headphones.)My recommendation? I suppose you could do worse, but not by much. If you want a cheap CD player, that's precisely what you'll get."
3,There's a better deal than this one.,"I bought this because of the car kit and it was reasonable priced. But you get what you paid for. I found out that the skip protection doesn't even work. Also the sound quality, with headsets, really stinks! Also, I have to buy a lot of batteries. It's cheap so you get what you pay for but stay away from this thing! You can find a better deal."
2,"Maybe it's just my bad luck, but . . .","I received a GPX CD player (same model as this but older version) for Christmas. I used it pretty regularly for about a month (during which I was very happy with it) and then put it away for a while. The next time I used it, it wouldn't recognize any CD.We returned it and received a new ""updated"" version which again worked for about a month. It has now been a month since I last used it and once again, it is not reading my CDs.My advice? Don't try this one unless you enjoy being frustrated!"
4,FOR THE PRICE CAN'T GO WRONG..,"GREAT PRICE FOR THE PRODUCT, PERFECT PRESENT FOR SOMEONE. 10 SECOND SKIP PROTECTION FEELS LIKE ITS 20 SECONDS....."
3,good for children,This is a very good product for children of ages 9-13 because it is fairly simple and inexpensive. You dont want to buy an expensive player and have it lost so even though it is in expensive this is alomost as good as the expensive players.
3,A CONCENSIOUS CONSUMER,This is an okay product which is great if you are hard on money or if you want to give to relatives. I bought 10 of these for my relatives in another country and they loved it. I think that it delivers the value of your money.
1,Cheap does NOT always mean a good value!,"Yes it's the cheapest CD player out there, but there's a reason for that. I didn't want to spend to much on a player, so I got this one, but just ended up sending it back. I should have just saved the money I spent shipping it back and used it to buy a slightly better player. Don't count on ANY skip protection. The headphones are almost worthless, and even on maximum volume it's far too faint. Spend the extra $20 or so for a better one. You will more than make up for it in aggravation, return shipping costs, and overall enjoyment."
1,Simply did not WORK!,"Ordered it, and when I received it, it just didn't work, either under battery power or with the AC Adapter. Product seemed flimsy and cheaply made. Amazon did promptly grant me credit upon the item's return."
1,Terrible reliability,"I bought the GPX A-ros, the ice blue one, and within aweek the thing broke on me--sporadically--sometimes it works andsometimes it doesn't. Using it has become pointless and a waste of time and money. It just feels cheap and the insides of it definitely won't last. In the end, You get what you pay for. Get something else.Who is this GPX anyways? I took a chance on them but they seem to be a no name from nowhere."
5,Excellent posthumous Goodman collection,"Steve Goodman's strengths were'nt always apparent with his studio LPs, less was normally more. Usually Steve, his guitar, and Jethro Burns on mandolin were more than enough for a wonderful outing. Ironically, this may be his best ""studio"" effort; a fine, often intriguing grab-bag of unreleased studio efforts, and live odds and ends. All are quite good-to-wonderful; ""Fool Such As I"" is lovely, and the live ""Dutchman"" is definitive. Which brings up another question: Where's the rest of the tapes these pieces are all coming from? C'mon guys, release 'em already! There's certainly a market for them."
3,so far didnt get it it said i will be here in december 20~ and i bought it a month ago,so far didnt get it it said i will be here in december 20~ and i bought it a month agonow i dont might waiting but i will take a longgggggg time to get to you
3,Cute,So I like love them. They might me a little small though but very cute. I fell deeply in love with the show inuyasha so I bough his necklace and his ears to attempt Cosplay but I am eleven and an otaku (not in a good way) so that didn't work. But it was still fun to Cosplay other things with them <3
3,Color is not as it appears,"I ordered this headband for a Halloween costume. The photo shows that the color is of brownish tint. Unfortunately, it's white, and not brown."
3,A good book,"Although I don't know much about Mesoamerica or Nahuatl, this dictionary appears to contain a good deal of accessible and useful information. An additional section includes a pronunciation guide."
4,Great resource for graduates and friends of the old SEBTS,"For those of us who are of the old Southeastern, this book is a welcomed history filled with vivid memories and what was.Southeastern was home to me from 1983-1986. I received my MDiv there, with all the hopes of returning someday for a D. Min.The overthrow of the Southern Baptist Convention left me and many others without a theological home-base. This book chronicles the years of developement and ministry of SEBTS. The hopes, dreams and prayers of many are chronicled for you here. If you are a friend of free Baptist, then this book is for you"
4,Should not be missed,"Clarifies the early vision and teaching approach of Southeastern. Essays are helpful in understanding the beginnings and finally the taking over of the school by fundamentalists. Certainly, the affirmation that Southeastern intended to be a different type of school within a denominational setting can be understood by a careful reading of these pages. A good contribution to a story of an incredible institution."
5,A Second Helping of Southern Rock,"As a sophomore effort, this album as a whole is more lyrically and musically imaginative than the eponymous first effort. Noticably missing is a top 40 single such as ""There goes another love song"" and the anthemic ""Green Grass and High Tides"". However, this album does not dissapoint. Beautiful yet powerful tunes and Eagles-esque vocal harmonies surely set this band apart from the other Southern Rock bands of its day and this album is a great example of the Outlaws vocal prowess. A great listen to loud with your car windows open driving down the boulevard on a sunny fall day. This is happy soulful music at its best."
2,lady in waiting,"thought i was ordering a cd. need better identity of what kind of recording type your selling.not sure what to do with an album, since i haven't owned a turn table in 20 years.it least it was cheap.lol."
1,Missing 2nd and Third Lead,I am an old Outlaws fan. And for the most part. There newley releast CDs Are very good. But Lady In Waiting is not. The CD is missing the 2nd & 3rd lead guitar rifs. Witch really sucks for a band who is known for a 3 Guitar Assult!
3,cjd,"I found this book to be very basic, nothing that enhances the concept. Of course it's a very basic concept, compounding. I guess the best way to ensure, as much as possible being that we're talking about investing, your returns is by picking the right stocks to begin with, that is stocks with rising dividends. So I'm not sure I really got anything special from this particular book"
3,Great for beginners,"This book is an excellent source for a complete novice. If you have never heard about investing in the stock market or you have very little knowledge and want to start investing, but do not know where to begin and which investment vehicles to choose, this book is for you. It will tell you what investment opportunities you have out there and compare it to a simple strategy of buying high (3% >) yielding stocks with at least 14% > dividend growth and you will double your yield every five years. It is however too generic, doesn't go into details how to actually pick the best quality stocks, screen for them, what metrics to look at etc.If you know and are somewhat experienced investor, do not even bother buying this book. It will be wasting of your money."
3,"'Ozzfest,Volume 1:Live' (Red Ant) various artists","An okay audio document of the first ever Ozzfest tour,as these cuts were recorded on Oct.25&26,1996 in Phoenix and San Bernadino.The best tracks,in my opinion were Ozzy's ""Perry Mason"",Slayer's face-ripping ""Angel Of Death"",Sepultura's ass-kicking ""Attitude"" and Coal Chamber's ""Loco"".Most patrons that've ever attended one or more Ozzfests should decently appreciate this disc."
2,WHEN ARE THEY GONNA RELEASE THIS ON DVD?????!!!!!!!!!!!,I put two stars only because the cd is great!BUT AIN'T WORTH HEARING IT ONLY!!!!!!!WE MUST SEE IT!!!!!!WE WANT TO SEE AND HEAR THE BEST METAL IN THE 90'S!!!!!WE WANT TO HAVE COOL FLASHBACKS AND MEMORIES OF THE 90'S!!!!!!!!!!P.S: WHO I GOT TO CONVINCE FOR THIS????!!!!ADIOS!!
2,Maybe I bought a 'sample',"I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased this item. ""What the heck,"" I thought. I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning. This was instead of the recommendation of twice a day. I like the stuff. My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy. In fact, I'd give it five stars except that now it's three weeks since I purchased this product and 'poof!' it's gone! I figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt. In my mind the 'goodness' of this product isn't worth the exorbitant price. Hence, two stars."
4,Does what the title says.,"This book has a wide range of meals to cook from. All that is needed is the basic cooking utensils and you're off! Even the courses in which I thought would be tough, turned out very when I followed the instructions. I would definitely recommend this."
2,not the item listed in the picture,I thought I ordered the pens that the picture showed. Sadly not I received a completely different item. The pens I was sent we're the Uni-ball signo gel impact 207 in blue. These pens are definately not what I was expecing or looking for. I think its false advertisement to list and product and send a completely different item.
1,Little Here on the Fire,"A word of caution for the reader: this book tells us almost nothing about the Great Chicago Fire itself. It says a little about the city's history and a lot about its ethos, but the fire is only a backdrop. I hope I am not alone in feeling that something mentioned in a title should be included extensively in the book."
5,Great memories,"I originally had this album on vinyl, then tape, now on CD. I must have played that vinyl down to a smooth platter.The spirit and energy of Stve Goodman really comes through here, from New Orleans to Tico Tico and Water is Wide.This will always be a special collection of music for me."
1,Worst policy I have seen,"I ordered this product along with Nu-11 8-in-1 supplement. Only received the other item instead of this product. Even their receipt indicate my order was correct, but was not filled the way I wanted. They told me they cannot guarantee what they can ship me. WTF! Is it fair if I ordered pork and you give me beef? They said the policy is displayed when I ordered the product, but I went back and try to order again and never see the policy displayed. I would never order from them again. They are called ""The Natural Health Shoppe""."
5,great reference,"This is one of the best color, texture reference books I've ever seen. It is definatly a must for all visual artists. The addition of the cd-rom is also a big asset."
4,"Good price, very soft!",This blanket is very soft and the picture doesn't do the color justice. I ordered the Wasabi/Coccoa butter for a baby John Deere nursery and the colors are fabulous!
1,disgraceful,how could God who killed whole populations of cities known to be homosexual now contradict Himself. This angel can't be from God. But then the satan was a liar from the beginng.
4,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this book and found it really helpful for understanding pulmonary diseases. This handles the pathophysiology so much better than does Robbins, etc. I found it a little wordy but otherwise pretty good."
3,Fairly Good Reference Book,"After looking through 1000 Rings, I was a bit disappointed in this sequal. Although the photography is excellent, it doesn't represent the same range and variety of styles. I did enjoy this book however, and will use it as a source of inspiration - it just didn't provide as much benefit as I'd hoped for."
2,500 Brooches Review,"This book, as all others in this series, is put together very well. But...the brooches are the poorest examples of exemplary contemporary artwork I have seen. In my opinion, 98% of the entries are unprofessional in their initial design and completion. Most are unwearable and impractical as brooches and are the farthest stretch of someone's artistic imagination in regards to fine artwork. Putting it bluntly, the bulk of the ""artwork"" in this book is rubbish. Embarrassing."
5,Worked perfectly for my '99 Tacoma,"Matched my stock Limited 1999 Tacoma door handle perfectly, and install was a snap. The build quality is great, and this handle seems like it's going to last at least another 10 years, just like the first. The only reason my original broke was because of some off road adventures. But what handle won't break if you abuse it properly? In the city, this thing should last you forever."
1,You get what you pay for!,This door handle broke within a week. The retainer for the center pivot was plastic and snapped off. Also the plastic insert for the metal actuator rod was so loose the rod would slip out. This replacement door handle isn't even close to being as sturdy as the original door handle. I am very disappointed.
1,"BEWARE, of cheap knockoffs!","Part fit great, and looked almost identical, sorry to say, it is a cheaply made part and broke within 45days. BEWARE!"
2,ALIBERTI DOES CALLAS,"Opera lovers take note. At your next party put on this CD and ask everyone who's singing. 9 people out of 10 will probably say ""Someone who's trying to imitate Callas"". There you have the plight of Lucia Aliberti.I've often wondered if Madame A's true vocal mechanism mirrors La Divina's coincidentally or if the lady is REALLY on an all out mission to resurrect the voice of a ghost. I just can't be sure. In the meantime on this CD there's plenty of inaccuracies in intonation, no trill, lots of wobble and high notes that sound really pressed. Likewise missing are subtleties in vocal colors and phrasing, and some really odd candenzas - all things that Maria Callas would never have let get past the studio. My understanding is Lucia Aliberti makes some kind of living in Western Europe where I guess people aren't as picky as I."
2,Too shocking to enjoy...,"I'm sorry but I can't enjoy this recital since it constantly shocks me how much Aliberti sounds like a 60s Callas. The bottle sound, the thin voice, the phrasing, the pushed low notes and she even looks like her on the cover! I'd rather have the real thing! Aliberti's high notes are in better condition than Callas' in the 60s but it came as no surprise that Aliberti didn't last long either. I'm also not surprised that she was so welcomed by recording companies who're always looking for a new Callas.2 stars because she is the best Callas look-and-sound alike I've ever encountered!"
3,Fun in the Tub!,"My twin boys love this basketball type game for in the bath tub. The only down fall is that it has to have a slick, smooth surface to stick to. My textured tile wouldn't let the suction cups stick. It works very well on glass -"
5,"smart, funny, and SEXY!","i loved this book because the characters were so likeable and their situations felt so real, yet so funny at times! i could totally relate to reese in the things she felt, the job she had, and the steamy crush she had on brian. it takes a while for reese and brian to give in to temptation, but when they finally do, you are in for some VERY hot and sexy scenes! i didn't want this story to end even though i read it so fast! great book, will try plum girl next."
1,blushing pink,"Literary syle was poor, content was a great read for the hormonal teenage person. All in all, an excellent book to skip."
4,Cute story and charismatic leads,"Reese discovers the best man at her sister's upcoming wedding is Brian, whom she shared a passionate kiss with on New year's Eve two years earlier. She questions her relationship with her boyfriend, who is not exactly warm and passionate, while juggling school, work, her dissertation, acting as a ghost writer for her professor, and coming to terms with her growing feelings for Brian, who may or may not still be engaged to his former girlfriend.It is a sweet and entertaining story, with believable lead characters that you really feel like you have gotten to know, while they get to know and learn to trust each other. Great story - check it out!"
1,Stupid Book,One of the most stupid bks I have ever read! Poorly written! Many bks of this type are interesting and fun-as well as well written but this was not.
1,Blushing Pink,This book starts of in confusion! I had a hard time remembering who was who the plot was off and on. The characters where dull it took to long to get to the actual players. I was so disappointed and I put the book down after the first chapter. The love scences where the best parts in the book I could visualize it happening!! Why is Reese such a push over! And Brian a wimp? The Arthur has a good story it was just to much stuff going on to keep my attention. Read at your own risk.Shelley
3,Good in parts but badly bound,"This book is useful in that it gives a history of site identification from the Hellenistic period onwards, and a good review of archaeological surveys at Troy up to the 1990s.Much of the book is devoted to proving that the Greek camp was not on the shores of the Hellespont but to the south-west of Troy.Many photos are just too small for their purpose. For instance, the critical view of Samothrace beyond Imbros ought to have been photographed with a telescopic lens to make the point.Although the book is a ""hardcover"" the pages are not sewn in but glued like a paperback. The spine was broken - and the pages loose - on the public library copy that I read. I wouldn't buy the book for this reason alone."
4,You can improve your skiing from a book,"I had only moderate expectations from this book because, well... it's a book! And how much can you learn about a physical technique-based activity from reading? But, I was pleasantly surprised by the great explanations of technique contained in Breakthrough on the New Skis. I had long been an intermediate skier, just the type for whom this book was written, and following the tips and exercises within this book did improve my technique. I gained a lot of confidence on the slopes and got to experience the joy of a good carve and fluffy powder. I still take second looks at steeps and bumps, and will always hate ice, but now I have a better skill set and know that I can make it down if I mind my methods. Will you become an ""expert"" after reading this? It is hard to say for sure, but if you think you could use this book, you are probably right."
5,The Bible of Ski Instruction.,"Simply put, this is the best book on skiing technique. I'm in awe that there is a negative review of this book. Despite its title, this book covers concepts from novice to expert technique. Lito's writing style is both engaging and very informative. He can convey complicated concepts with ease. This book not only covers how to coorect and advance your ski technique but also why you are performing the exercises, motions, etc., how they translate into carved (and skidded), controlled turns in various terrain. I am a very strong skier but I still frequently turn to this book to understand small corrections in my technique. Yes, this book can be repetitive but this helps to ingrain the concepts Lito is teaching. This book convinced me to sign up for his Aspen course which is also excellent."
1,Breakthrough on the new skis,"I anticipated this book to be a modern, thorough, substantial, instruction on skiing on the new shaped skis.Unfortunately I found Tejada-flores book to be a bunch of repetitive fluff. It is basically a rehash of the same material that has been covered previously. It took him approximately 62 pages to pronounce you should weight the outside ski to initiate a turn. How revolutionary! I was waiting for him to say you should point your skis downhill to go.The illustrations are great if you like pictures of the author. The diagrams are confusing.I suggest putting the money toward a lesson as this book is worthless."
4,breakthrough on the new skis,This is great stuff. Now skiing makes sense. I understand how the skis turn/slide/skid the way they do. Must read.
5,"Fresh, feminine scent","I am so pleased with this new scent. To me, and most who have smelled it, it's reminiscent of talcum/baby powder, but with sophisticated undertones. It's a very soft, feminine fragrance."
1,RIP OFF...NO STARS,"THE PERFUME I ORDRED FROM THIS SELLER CAME NOT ONLY ""UNBOXED"" AS STATED IN THE LISTING, BUT ALSOWITH NO CAP AND IT IS MARKED ""TESTER""....WHO WOULD WANT TO BUY AN UNCAPPED TESTER? NOT ME, I AM RETURNING IT, BUT I'M STILL OUT FOR POSTAGEEACH WAY. A RIP OFF. I LAST PURCHASED THIS PERFUME FROM OVERSTOCK, SAME PRICE AND IT WAS IN A SEALED BOX, BRAND NEW...MY FAULT FOR NOT DOING THE SAME AGAIN.BUYER BEWARE."
1,"Items great, seller not so much","The product is great. Bold (1.0 mm) point looks great on signatures and the 3 different colors allows for variation in the color. All in all a great product (plus Sanford satisfaction guarantee is a plus in case the product does not conform to expectations). However, the seller, TNT Deals INC is not so good and the reason why I gave 1 star to the item; after all the seller does influence the product experience... The item was not ready for shipping for 3 business days after all the other items were ready and my shipment ended up being delayed due to this..."
4,Mesmerizing,"This was an excellent book. I couldn't put it down and I don't even like to read. At some parts I almost broke down in tears. This is a tragic, yet entracing book and I strongly recommend it for anyone between grades 6 and 9. This has become one of my favorite books."
5,Anne Frank And Me,Anne Frank And Me was a FANTASTIC book. It's about a 16 year old girl who goes on a fir=eld trip with her class. She gets knocked out and falls into a deep sleep.When she supposeovly wakes up she finds that she is in the time when Hitler ruled the Jews. Read to find out what happens!!
5,A Holocaust Thriller,"I couldn't put it down! I'e never read such a book. It may sound like nothing but a sermon, but it's nothing like that! I'm a sophomore in high school, and I know excitement when I see it. On a field trip to the Holocaust museum, some students open fire, and Nicole passes out as she's trampled by the crowd, waking up to find herself in Nazi occupied France in 1942. All the people from her real life (parents, sister, and schoolmates) are here, andthe boy she had a crush on is even madly in love with her. But Nicole soon learns the real meaning of life, and that boys and clothes hardly matter as much as family, safety, and even food enough to survive when she finds herself in a concentration camp... with Anne Frank."
5,Fasinating,"I have to say, I adore this book.The way each word was carefully crafted to fit in with the rest of the story was wonderful. It offred a fictional but realistic vision into the Nazi era in France. Nicole Burns, a highschool girl in the 21st Century, is time warped into the life of Nicole Bernhardt, a jewish-french teenager living in the Nazi reign on Europe. This book is factual, yet easy to read. I would definetely reccomend it."
5,"AMAZING, A GREAT READ!","This book is about a normal teenage girl named Nicole, who, while at an Anne Frank exhibit, gets transported back in time to Paris during the Holocaust. It is a very moving book, and shockingly comparable to ""The devils arithmetic"" (If you haven't read the devils arithmetic, READ IT NOW!!). It was so great, and I strongly recommend you read it! At one time in the book, Nicole even comes face to face with Anne herself! so read it!"
5,Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld get teen-readers,"Anne Franks and Me is a novel based on a high-school aged girl named Nicole. Nicole is an average girl: not the popular one, not the geeky one and not the prettiest one. Her assignment for English, was to read ""The Diary of Anne Frank"". But she is so caught up doing her own every day things, that she bags her assignment and forgets about it. But, when her class takes a field trip to an Anne Frank exibit, Nicole's world is turned upside down. She finds herself in 1942 as a young Jewish Girl durring the times of the Holocaust. Is her new life just a bad dream? Or has her previous experiences(and life!) been the actual dream? I highly recommend this book to everyone! It truly has something for everyone: love, adventure, tragedy and drama! Cherie Bennett and Jeff Gottesfeld have truly done it again! They have caught the reader in such a tight grip that they can't let go!(Or put AFAM down!)This book is truly a treasure every home must own!"
2,Bad production!,"Girl is young, cute, but dvd-r has numerous pixelation. Not worth purchase as pixelation is incredibly distracting. I buy so often from this web site that I did not have a chance to watch until return policy void. DO NOT BUY unless you can watch quickly to confirm inferior production quality does not waste your money!!!"
5,The Book I Read in Roswell,"I visited Roswell some years ago.After spending a couple of days going through the museum & looking around, I found this book in the UFO Museum library. I flicked through it, compared it to the evidence in the museum & realised that Pflock was right! It was all baloney.This doesn't mean that there are no flying saucers, just that Roswell wasn't one."
2,Not satisfied,"Not what I expected. The film quality was not good & it was a random array of dances, not just Iranian."
3,Okay but save your money and check the consignment store instead,"My husband's grandparents gave this toy to our son last week for his first birthday and our son hasn't touched it once. He has absolutely zero interest in it.Btw, I was at the local children's consignment shop today and I saw NINE of these for sale. Save your money and get this gently used or not at all.***UPDATE 11/30/12***I've increased the stars on this review from 2 to 3. My son does occasionally like to play with this dog. He enjoys the music and likes to hug it. He hasn't used it for its educational properties but we keep it around due to the music and hug factors. I'd say this is an average toy. I still recommend checking your consignment stores because I always see these there."
4,very cute puppy,purchased this for 19 month grandson but he is still slightly intimidated by it; he prefers toys that are 100% musical; but think as he gets older will enjoy this puppy more
3,"Okay, But Too Loud","I bought this for my 29 month old grandson. At first he did not play with it much. Now he likes to play, sing, and dance to the songs. This dog is cute, but it's loud. There should have been a volume control on the dog. After listening to the singing for a while, I got concerned about the volume affecting my grandchildren and my ears.If I try to put it up, sometimes my grandson wants to still play with it and will get upset. I try and do this to give us a break from the loud volume. So of course, I tend to give in and let him play for a little while longer. His baby sister likes it also, and both have their favorite songs. This is my only complaint about the dog, which is why I gave it a 3 star."
3,"Fun, But VERY Sensitive","My son has had this toy for several months now and he enjoys playing with it and carrying it around. He pulls it out of the toy box every few days or so if he hasn't played with it recently. I am happy that he still finds it interesting after all of these months. I like it for the most part, but I have a few issues.1) It is remarkably sensitive and the lightest touch sets it off. It has to be completely still to keep from being activated.2) It says ""I love you."" I may be a sap, but I don't like that a stuffed/plastic toy is saying something it can't actually feel. I think that cheapens the sentiment.3) If it hasn't been touched after a minute or so, it will say something so the child will return to playing with it. It has startled me a couple of times when it's been left on and I'm cleaning up scattered toys."
4,Son loved it!,My son loved this gift after getting it for his first birthday. He loved the music and would dance it it all the time. We also worked with him learning his colors and ears/nose/mouth/etc. He's now 4 1/2 and has been playing it for his baby brother. Still works like the day we got it.
5,Great toy!,"My 18 month old received this for her 1st birthday. She LOVES it. Puppy is easy for her to activate (squeeze ear, paws, tummy, etc.) One of her favorite toys!"
4,All Smiles,"My son smiles everytime I pull this guy out. This puppy has a cute voice and a LOT to say. Actually, he interrupts himself, he has so much to say. I love the songs, especially the toes rhyme. Instead of ""This Piggie"", his is ""This Puppy""."
5,Perfect for babies,"I was so impressed when I registered for this product for out upcoming baby, that I purchased one for my new niece for Xmas. The basic learning attributes of this puppy make it the perfect gift for babies!"
4,Wonderful learning toy,"I love this toy. I brought this for my 15 months old grandson, for Christmas. He loves this puppy. He squeezes the nose and ear and toes on the puppy. He learned where his ears and nose where located on his face. I thought that was awesome. The only thiing, is the puppy is very sensitive. Meaning, if you squeeze the toes and bump the puppy on a surface, it will switch to saying something else, quickly. But,other than that, I highly recommend this learning toy for all little boys and girls."
3,Way to sensitive...,"Ok, this is a cute dog, and the premise for it is a good one. I do have a couple things that annoy me. You can't touch it without the dog going off, even if it is turned ""off"". This becomes a problem if my daughter has gone to sleep with it near and it wakes her up. And the voice is a bit too annoying for me to hear for too long. But, hey, my daughter likes it, that is why it got 3 stars.Sorcha"
5,Laugh & Learn Learning Puppy,"This is the cutest educational toy in the world!!It teaches numbers, colors, letters, etc.It also sings!This toy also entertains me!Where was this toy when I was little?!"
5,EXCELLENT toy,"I purchased this doll for my 11 month old daughter less than a week ago and she can't get enough of it! She loves to see the dog bone light up, she gets a kick out of the songs and expressions, but most important of all, SHE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK. I have lots of other toy dolls that play music and light up for my daughter, but this is the only toy that she can make work by herself. The sensors are sensitive enough to allow her to be able to squeeze the body parts and make the doll work on her own. I love this product-- we carry it everywhere we go now because she won't put it down!"
4,Adorable Puppy!,"My two little boys (9 months & 2 years) enjoys this puppy.Easy to push buttons. The puppy plays cute songs, colors, ABC's,numbers and body parts. Also makes puppy noises. He said the ""Little Puppies (little pigs) go to Market,"" ""Head & Shoulder."" It is adorable, easy to carry and the puppy's voice is not annoying."
4,Fun Toy with Slight Quirk,"I really like this toy for it's education value. It teaches you body parts, colors, as well as having fun, catchy songs. My four-year old loves helping his baby sister sing the songs and learn where each part of the body is. It also throws in some cute phrases to make it more amusing. The only problem I have with it is it's occasional ""creepiness"". It's not exactly pleasant to wake up at 3 o' clock in the morning to ""Haha, that tickles"". My husband and I almost half expected it to walk into our room of its own accord singing. I do wish it was a lot less sensitive, which has it's ups and downs. It's great for the younger baby crowd, a little less so for the older. I think in the long run I'd prefer it being less sensitive to touch so I don't have to hear it at odd hours."
3,It's Okay,"My 10 month old daughter received this as a gift. She will smile at the light and the sounds, but is not very interested in the toy. As an adult I also found the voice and sounds pretty annoying."
3,CUTE WHILE IT LASTED!,"My daughter rec'd this for Christmas an absolutely loved it, but then it stopped working. The button in the ear is only attached to the ear on the inside by a wire. I know this b/c you can feel it. While our wire got disconnected, so the ear stopped working. Then everything started getting harder and harder to push. It could use some better construction on the inside. Our receipt was long gone, so I couldn't take it back for another one, either."
5,Even for newborn,"Our daughter Alexa is only 6 weeks old but absolutely loves her Puppy. It sits on her changing table and when we change her (which seems like a constant thing) she just stares at it, smiles, and reaches for it. We hit the paws/ears for her to make it sing and talk and when we get up, we tell her ""Okay, say bye-bye"" and we shut it off and of course, Puppy says ""bye-bye"". It think her first word will be bye-bye. We have friends expecting and that is one of the gifts they will get from us whether they regsiter for it or not."
5,Best Buy!,"My daughter loves this since she was only 4 months, she's a year old now, I can say this is one of her favorite toy. She prefers playing with this than Baby Tad because it is a lot lighter and more huggable :)"
4,Laugh and Learn Puppy,"Great fun with my 6 month old. The only drawback is just as you and baby get""into"" a song, one little touch on the puppy stops the song and you get a new message. This happens frequently as baby is busy exploring the puppy with his hands, mouth and even feet.Other than that it is a good product and you do get your monies worth.Jacqui"
2,Super noisy and annoying,"Okay. My son has had this for over a year now. He goes through periods where he doesn't look at it for months, then wants to take it everywhere. But, it is a super annoying toy and I would be just as happy to ""lose"" it in the next toy rotation.One - the sensor is super duper sensitive. A strong breeze can turn the darn thing on.Two - I don't like how once a kid has put it down, it keeps chiming up trying to lure the kid back to the toyThree - This puppy is super needy. It is always asking for hugs and wanting to know if you love it. It seems like it is gearing them up for having an insecure girlfriend/boyfriend later in life.Four - as for being educational, you can't understand what it is saying half the time, and the songs are hard to play along to. No more educational than using a regular doll to teach hands, feet, ears, etc...As you can tell, I'm not a big fan of this toy. Spend your money on something quieter."
3,This Doll is Evil,"This doll has a mind of its own. Because of that, I cannot recommend it.One night (actually early morning, like 2am) while I was sleeping, this doll activated itself! It was the first time I had ever heard it and at the time, didn't know that it was this doll. Imagine how creepy it is to be in a deep sleep and all of a sudden, in a completely dark room, you are woken up by this doll saying ""Peeakaboo, I see you!"" Its like something out of a horror movie where a doll comes alive. I feel bad for any child who experiences this.I have also found the comtrol buttons, which are underneath the pads on its paws, to be quite difficult to use and inaccurate. Pressing one button results in some unintended consequences.Pass on this one."
3,Annoying,"My son got this as a gift when he was 8 months old. He likes this toy, but I find it too annoying. It's very sensitive, and will change the sound effect although no one has even touched it. So it will be in the middle of a song, and switch over to something else, and then switch yet again. Great way to get your kid to have some attention deficit disorder, I think.And personally, I think an electronic toy saying ""I Love You"" and ""You're my friend"" is insulting!"
2,Had to take out the batteries!,Cute? Yes. Lovable? Sure. Annoying in the middle of the night?! YES!We finally had to take the batteries out of this thing because it would start singing on it's own at 3am and wouldn't stop until someone would go push the off button.
3,Foot... Yellow foot...,"""Foot... Yellow foot...""This is what our puppy does... when no one is even remotely touching it. It's a little creepy, actually. One minute, my wife and I will be sitting on the couch watching TV while our baby sleeps upstairs in the nursery. The next, the puppy will moan, ""Foot..."" I'm sure there's got to be a wire loose somewhere. We had the puppy for about four months before anything went haywire (too late to return it). But now that damn right foot (the yellow one) just LOVES to go off. Press an actual trigger (hand, ear, nose, wherever) and the puppy works just fine. But it's annoying to be holding the puppy up while it's singing a song, only to have that song spontaneously interrupt itself to say ""Foot... Yellow foot..."" ARGH!I realize this is an isolated complaint and won't be useful to most readers. But be aware that this CAN potentially happen. Otherwise, it's a wonderful toy that our baby girl just LOVES to play with."
3,Ear stopped working!,"This was an early favorite with my daughter. As annoying as the voice and sounds can be, she really loved it. But after about 10 months of light/medium use, the ear stopped working!? Its a shame - she still tries to push the button there and gets frustrated when it doesn't play the song it used to. Cute toy, but with all the wires in a plush toy, I guess there is a higher chance of something getting pulled the wrong way and breaking."
2,Loved this until,Loved this until I found out the blue ears were toxic and my daughter loves to constantly chew on them....it is now put away until she stops putting everything into her mouth...if then
3,"Great, but super senstive","My son received this as a gift and it is great and there is alot of functions on the toy. The negative about this toy is it is super sensitive. The off button is on the foot, and it seems my son hits the button and it'll say ""Bye Bye"" alot, so you have to always turn it on."
5,Awesome!,"This toy is great. I bought it a month ago when my son is only 5 months old. He loves the sounds. It has saved me from dealing with a crying tantrum a couple of times. My son is a little too young to fully appreciate this puppy because right now, he is at a stage where everything goes in his mouth. My son loves the ears! Even if the ears are far away from him, he would specifically reach for them so that he could put them in his mouth.Watch out if the toy is in the crib or playpen when putting your baby in to sleep. Your baby might hit it and startle your baby awake when it starts singing/talking."
3,not durable,"We love this toy, but the buttons stopped working less then a month after we bought it. No more music and ears!! Bummer, we really liked it, too bad it didn't last"
2,Cute Puppy - Annoying Singing Voice!!,"My husband and I bought this puppy for our almost-6-month-old son. We thought it was really cute... it had a cute voice that sounded like a little kid talking... until it started singing. Apparently the girl that they got to sing as the puppy's voice wanted to be a Broadway singer but it just didn't work out. It's nice to put some feeling into your songs but after hearing the ABC song TWICE we were ready to throw the puppy out the window. Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes is even worse. It just grates on you. It sounds more like a bad Broadway revue than a cute plush toy. I predict that our puppy will tragically lose its voice by Christmas.Another thing that bothers me is that they changed ""This little piggy"" to ""this little puppy.""The baby seems to like it, though, and that's what really matters here."
2,Dissappointed in this little pup,"I am very disappointed in this toy. The abc song stops at ""q"" and the ""this little piggy"" and ""itsy bitsy spider"" songs sing one line and then it's over. It is a very cute little dog but I don't want my grandson only learning part of the alphabet. I will be returning this puppy. I gave it 2 stars because it does not educate very well, but as far as cuteness goes it gets 5 stars."
1,"NIce toy, but not at 6x retail.",This is a $20 toy easily available at that price at other online retailers and in store. This seller is charging 6x the regular price.
2,My child was never engaged by this toy,"My DS never was drawn to this toy. I tried showing him, ignorning it to let him pick it up, putting it away for months, then bringing it back out. Nothing. And it goes off on its own sometimes, not ideal when your child is sleeping or you are sleeping so I had to keep it away from all sleep areas. I am 'sure' I would turn it off then it would go on by itself again. Then there is that gosh darn 'yellow foot'. Way too sensitive compared to other parts and other parts like the ear, way to non-sensitive for a younger child."
2,Not worth the effort,"I bought this toy for my 1-year-old nephew for Christmas. I believe it to be a great learning toy but it's entirely too sensitive. Before Christmas, I had it stored in my closet and it would go off at random times, sometimes in the middle of the night! Once he opened it, it would randomly say things as well and just slightly moving it caused it to start saying several things at once. If he touches the ear and then the tummy, it doesn't finish saying one thing before it starts another. I think that is very confusing."
3,Creepy!,"Creepy!My parents bought this for our one year old son. Overall, our son has had a blast with this small spawn of Satan. The music is cheery and catchy. Our son enjoys it and that's what matters most.Why is it creepy? It will randomly start talking when no one has touched it in hours. Imagine sitting with your significant other watching a nice romantic movie when all of a sudden, from the toy box you hear ""Ear!"" This has happened on many occasions.Like other reviews have stated, the buttons are super sensitive.Bottom line: Fun, cute, not too high of an annoying factor for parents...but quite possibly possessed."
3,"Good Concept, Doesn't hold child's attention","This toy has a great concept: learn colors and body parts (hand, foot, mouth, ear, etc.) accompanied by familiar children's songs. I like it. But for my 12 month old daughter it isn't interesting enough to hold her attention for more than a minute. My 3 y.o. likes to hear the songs, but she already knows her colors and body parts. She'll listen to it for a few minutes longer, then it just goes back in the box with the stuffed animals.There is one thing that is rather annoying, there's no internal on/off button. So the puppy can't be held purely as a stuffed animal (ie, at night when the child is sleeping), because, if your child touches the button on the foot it is easily turned back on. It's unfortunate that the kids don't like this toy better, maybe it would be good for a road trip or something."
2,Poorly Designed,"We have this Learning Puppy and the Hug & Learn Baby Tad and I have to say the design of Tad is much better than the Puppy. The buttons on the Puppy are so sensitive that the slightest touch changes the song or the learning mode. The Tad needs a little bit of force (but not so much force that a 4 month old can't push the buttons) and so a song will normally complete itself and the modes don't change as easily. I'm glad that I got the Puppy as a buy one get one free sale and didn't pay full price for it. My son, who is now 6 months old, sees Tad as his friend. Do not recommend the Puppy."
3,Try absolutely brand new batteries,"I've been on my way back to Toys R Us with a toy before, but stopped at the hardware store on the way and got new batteries, and the toy worked perfectly."
5,This is cool,"My son is barely 3 months old and he just loves this. The music and the lights catch his eyes. I bought it because I thought it was cute and educational and it is. It's not an advanced toy but for someone his age and any child near 1 and a half, it's fun"
2,Disappointed,"I wish our Learning Puppy worked as well as all the other reviewers'! Perhaps ours has a flaw, but it seems like a complete waste of money. It switches modes with the lightest touch, and our toddler isn't prone to light touches. Every time he grabs the Puppy, it changes, even right in the middle of a song. It doesn't seem to matter if he grabs the foot with the mode switch or not. Instead of being a learning toy, it spews a garbled mix of information. The only way to get it to complete a song is to have it up where my son can't reach it... and that's not any fun!I plan to call Fisher Price to see if we can get ours replaced."
3,Cute and Fun Toy but Didn't Hold Up!,My mom gave this to our son for Christmas and he loved it...but the ear sensor broke within the first two months and that was the part that played his favorite song. He'll still pick it up on occasion but it spends most it's time sitting in his closet in a toy bin unused. I read that many reviewers had the ear break within months of owning it...might purchase again ONLY if it came with at least a year warranty.
2,Frustrating Toy,My kids think this toy is ok but it drives me crazy! The sounds and songs are cute but the buttons are SO sensitive that we can never get through one before starting another. If we really want to hear anything out of this dog I need to hold it still while it plays. When my daughter trys to play a song it will switch to something else a couple beats in.This pup is so sensitive that I almost ran off the road while in the car alone and a bump made it start singing. The chuckle I got after figuring out what the unexpected noise was could have been the most fun we've ever had with this toy.
2,We named it Yellow Foot,"The yellow foot sensor is so sensitive that it goes off all the time, so we just named him Yellow Foot.On the song setting, it would be nice to have a delay feature of some kind that lets the song finish even if another sensor is pushed. I can appreciate that, because of the target age, the sensors need to be easy to push, but I think they are a bit over sensitive in general. My daughter greatly enjoys the songs, which I don't find annoying personally, but we rarely get to hear them unless I hold her back from touching the toy until the end of the song!I can see this being a very educational toy. It is fun, really, but it's definitely not a hands-on toy because of the over sensitive panels...especially the yellow foot.And I didn't even know there was an off feature! We always turn off the battery pack."
5,Great baby toy,I bought this toy for my four month old grandson and he really lives it. It is made from soft materials so he doesn't bump his head.
3,Poorly made - it stopped working almost immediately!,"We purchased this toy based on the great reviews here, and DS absolutely LOVED it. Great music, teaching, etc. But within 2 weeks, it STOPPED WORKING PROPERLY.Now if you even gently touch it, it switches songs or stops making music. It seems like there is a loose connection inside. DS has been very frustrated when a song starts to play, and then stops or switches songs when he barely moves!"
4,Portable fun!!!!!,"I think the best thing about this toy is that it can go anywhere, and keeps my baby happy in the car, and that it sings, Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, which is my baby's favorite song. She gets so excited when the music starts playing. I also experienced the broken ear, but it happened soon after we bought it so we returned it to the store. We have had the new one for about a week and have not yet experienced any problems. It is a very educational toy, she is learning all of the body parts and plays with this toy all the time. Broken ear aside, I would recommend this toy to any parent."
1,Too Sensitive to Touch,"I bought this toy for my 6 month old son after seeing it on many ""bestselling toys"" lists and based on the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst toy purchases I've made. The Laugh and Learn puppy is supposed to have two modes, one for leaning and one for fun songs. The puppy's left foot is meant to act as a switch between the two modes, but it doesn't stay in either mode regardless of whether you touch the left foot or not. The puppy has many cute songs, but I have never heard it complete a song, as it randomly says things like ""let's learn and play games"" or ""yellow foot"" or ""that tickles"" in the middle of a song! The puppy is supposed to say these things in learning mode when it is touched, but even when it is just sitting on the floor with no one nearby, it changes from song mode to a random blurb about body parts and colors. This toy definitely doesn't help my little one learn anything."
5,Kids love it!,Bought two of these for my nieces and they absolutely LOVE them. One is just six months old and has no problem squeezing his ears etc. to make sounds and music. The other is two and loves dancing to the music she can make the puppy make. I did find that the toy is very sensitive (great for the kids though)so I had to turn off the mechanism in order to ship it and that was very easy to do (unlike some toys). I think it is very well made and a great price. Would absolutely recommend this toy!
3,We call it the devil dog!,"No really, this thing goes off at all hours of the night!! I didn't care for it too much and the kids really didn't play with it as intended. A lot better Laugh & Learn toys to be had over this one."
2,not a very good musical toy!,"I got this for my 10 month old son, he loves music, well its cute and cuddly but the music part of it isnt great at all! the songs dont finish, at first i thought he was pressing something on the puppy to cut the song off so abruptly so i sat down with him and pressed one part of the body and the song came on but ddint finish (like i said ended pretty abruptly) so i tried another and they all do that! not a very good musical toy"
3,My daughter loves it but it has some issues.,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was 4 months old. She's 11 months old now and it's still one of her favorite toys but it has some issues. Like other reviewers said, it's too sensitive and the only way to hear an entire song or phrase is to hold the dog perfectly still. If there is pressure anywhere near a pressure point, or any motion at all, it skips from phrase to song to song to phrase. I don't know how educational it can be if she can never hear what it is supposed to say. It will also start singing when it's sitting in the toy box. It freaks me out when it's midnight, no one has been anywhere near the dog for hours and it starts singing. There's a switch under the velcro in the back so if you buy this toy, make sure you turn the dog off when your kid is done playing with it. Otherwise it's a bit like Chucky. My daughter would give the dog five stars. I would give it one. So I put the rating in the middle."
3,good toy,great learning toy.. However if the baby is jiggiling the doll around every different tune or body part goes off.. The puppy needs to be kept still when touching each body part. Otherwise the babies love it..
3,Laugh & Learn cuddly Learning Puppy,It is cute and the baby enjoyed it and learned quickly how to get it to make noise. Only disappointment is that it does not play the complete song but stops after only a few lines.
4,EDUCATIONAL TOY BUT NOT DURABLE,I received this toy when my son was 6-9 months old. He loves to hold the puppy by the ears which has caused the ear wire to break off of the activation button. I called fisher price reported the problem and they sent me a new puppy for free. I had the second puppy for less than a week when the same thing happened again. It is a great educational toy but not durable if your child is likely to carry/hold the puppy by the ears.
4,Fun for everyone,"I bought this for my 13 month old, but so far my 3 year old is getting the most fun out of it. He loves to sing along with the puppy. He presses a button then runs around in circles dancing and singing. Meanwhile the baby just laughs at them both, but doesn't seem to interested in actually pressing buttons and playing with it."
2,Demon Dog,"We gave this toy to our youngest niece a few years ago and it has received the nickname ""Demon Dog"" throughout our family. Sure it's great for learning purposes, however; you'll be sleeping at night and all of a sudden be woken up by the dog saying, ""Play with me!"" from the living room. It makes me think of Chucky. I have to say if anyone gives my baby this toy we would promptly donate it to the Goodwill."
1,DONT BUY THIS TOY!,"I purchased one of these for my nephew at Christmas, only to be embarrased when it did not work. I returned it to Toy's are US. I had to buy one to replace it from an Amazon store, it also did not work. Apparently they have a factory defect Fisher Price is not telling us about. BEWARE"
2,my son is uninterested,My son has never once played with this toy. He got it when he was 6 months old and now he is 14 months old and he has never shown any interest in it. Fortunately it was a gift from a family member so we didn't waste our money.
2,Room for improvement,"The concept is great but there's room for improvement. The most annoying thing is when you touch his hand or feet ever so lightly, a different song or message starts or worse, it turns off. So the puppy could be singing a song and you're having the puppy dance around, and oops, puppy's foot touches the floor by accident and puppy says ""bye bye"". He's done with that song!"
2,"great toy, but did not hold up","My husband and I bought this toy for our 21 month old daughter. She adored it. After 1 week the ear quit functioning so we returned it and got another one. That one lasted longer, but not much after a month the ear, purple hand, and yellow foot stopped working.. My husband performed surgery on the puppy and found that the wires came unsoddered ( excuse my spelling) from the reciever this lead to the malfunction.. It is a great toy, my daughter absolutely loved it, but unless it is fixed and the quality of workmanship is increased, I would not reccomend this toy to anyone. Too bad really!"
4,Lots of Fun!,"My daughter loves this puppy. When she was 9 months old she saw it in the store and wouldn't put it down. It's very cute and she loves pushing the buttons. The first puppy lasted about a month before the ear stopped working. We returned it and got another one, it lasted a few months longer but the ear broke again. I am even going to bother trying to get it replaced. She doesn't even really notice, and it seems like such a common problem it will probably happen again.Hopefully Fisher Price will get the problem fixed soon. It's such a cute toy."
1,Sensitivity makes this toy an ANNOYING nuisance,"I DID pull the demo tag out...but this toy doesn't finish any of the songs, etc. because it is WAY TOO SENSITIVE. The slightest movement sets it off and switches modes...which makes it pretty much useless. Definitely not worth $20 for a stuffed animal. I wish I had the receipt and could return it! Maybe Fisher Price should fix the problem and send us all a replacement part. That said, it would be a GREAT toy IF it worked properly."
1,waste of money,"When we received this as a gift, I thought it was broken because all the songs cut off in the middle (e.g., the alphabet song stops somewhere around P). But when I went to exchange it, I discovered that all of the Laugh & Learn Puppies on the shelf did the same thing. What's the point of having a toy that stops halfway through the alphabet?? It makes no sense, and it's incredibly annoying. Try Baby Tad from Leapfrong as a better, more functional alternative."
4,"Too many buttons, but kids enjoy it","Yes there are several buttons all over this pooch. They are very sensitive to where if you barely move it, another sound begins before the other finishes. It's tempting to take the batteries out an let the kids play with it that way. Kids like a lot."
4,First real toy my son LOVES!,"My son is only 3 months old but someone got us this toy as a gift. And he LOVES it! We sing along with the dog and it's really got his verbal abilities growing since he tries to sing with us. He also focuses on it and laughs when he sees ""doggie."" We can't wait to see what he'll be doing at 6 months! My only complaint is that the parts are a little sensitive so when he really gets going with the kicking and grabbing it's just a lot of random stuff. Maybe because he's only 3 months..."
4,My daughter loves it,"My 1 and 1/2 year old loves the songs on this toy. I have a concern about the durability, though. The button on the ear stopped working after using it for about 6 months, and she is not hard on her toys."
3,POOPY PUPPY,"I BOUGHT THIS PUPPY FOR MY ALMOST TWO YEAR OLD GRANDSON. AT FIRST IT SEEMED ENTERTAINING TO HIM BUT NOT FOR LONG. KIDS TEND TO WANT TO DO TOO MANY THINGS AT ONCE, ARE VERY EAGER AND THE PUPPY DID NOT ALWAYS RESPOND PROPERLY OR RESPONDED INCORRECTLY IN PROPORTION TO THE INDICATED AREAS OF RESPONSE. IT OFTEN GOES OFF BY ITSELF AS WELL. SO DON'T EXPECT THIS LITTLE PUP TO HOLD UP WELL OR FOR LONG IF YOUR CHILD IS EAGER AND IMPATIENT. OTHERWISE IT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD LEARNING TOOL BUT IT DOES NOT RECITE THE ENTIRE ALPHABET. PRESS ONE AREA AT A TIME SLOWLY AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL RESPOND CORRECTLY. GOOD LUCK!"
3,CUTE TOY,"I bought this for my grandson last Christmas, but he has never been very interested in it! If I held it in front of him and pressed the different parts he might laugh, but never a toy he would play with on his own! I got it just before he turned two and he has a 4 1/2 year old brother and thinks he can do everything he can. I think he is just too active for this toy. He's more about cars and trains! Would be best for a child who likes to sit and sing a lot!"
3,Could use some adjustments,"This could have been a fantastic product, however, it is not. The buttons are TOO sensitive. The dog doesn't finish one song before it is starting the next one. If you are holding it, forget it! I really had high hopes for this toy, but it gets too annoying, so it does not get used."
5,the best hug-able interactive stuffed animal,This toy was honestly the best choice amongst all others. Tickle me Elmo was good for a while and fun. I see my little Teema interacting and dancing to this toy. I was debating between this and the Pooh bear versions from another maker. I am so glad I took this one.
5,One year old LOVED it!,"I purchased this cute, educational toy for a special little girl's first birthday gift. She received many other gifts at her party, but this one elicited a HUG smile and even a chuckle when she pressed the puppy's foot. Her favorite seems to be the music so far. Great toy that will hold her interest and teach her things, too. My Granddaughter has one and loves it, too, singing along with the puppy and playing pat-a-cake while it sings. :-)"
4,fun songs and learning opportunities,My son received this for his 1st birthday. He enjoyed it and played with it (with us singing along too) for about 20 minute stretches. We took it on a few airplanes with us as well b/c it's loud enough that you can hear it if it's close to you but the general noise of the plane drowns out the sound for other passengers. He is 2 now and still pulls this out to play with but it doesn't keep his interest as long anymore. We can still use it to teach colors but he knows the body parts. I would probably buy again and i think an 8-9 month old would be perfectly fine w/ this toy.
4,Remove the Sample Mode Tag Carefully,"I had the same problem many of the bad reviews had. It only went to letter P. It never turned off. It drove me nuts. I noticed there was a tiny piece of plastic in the slit where the Sample Mode tag had been. (It's the tag that says ""Remove tag for Normal Play mode"" on it.) I don't feel as dumb since since LOTS of other people had the same problem.I exchanged the toy and carefully removed the tag. No little piece of plastic and it works GREAT! Okay, it still drives me nuts (that's why only four stars). But it does the whole song every time and my 12 month son loves it!"
1,worst toy ever!,"after reading positive reviews on amazon, we were excited to get this dog for our 7 month old. now however, we just call 'that stupid dog'. it's says two things - ""it's learning time!"" and immidiately thereafter, ""bye bye!"". every time our baby touches it, it says ""bye bye"" so it is just a total waste of money. pure junk."
3,"It's cute, but way too sensitive!","This thing drives me nuts, but what kid toy doesn't? My daughter seems to like it. However, it is ultra sensitive! It turns on/off with the slightest touch, which is really creepy in the middle of the night when your cat accidentally rubs up against it. When my daughter is playing with it, if she bumps the foot even slightly, it switches in mid sentence to something else, which I can tell is confusing to her. Example: ""Bye Got my nose! You're wonder...let's sing and play games, bye bye!"" I think they did this so it would be easy for babies and kids to use it, but it's way too sensitive. It needs to finish it's sentence or song before it switches to something else."
3,First Toy Delivered Did Not Work !,"This is my first review & I am writing it because this was the very first time that I got a toy stuff that did not function at all ! Felt very miserable as it was for my child, but Thanks to Customer Service, they replaced it immediately with a totally function-able one.This toy is an average educational product because most of the rhymes-songs are pretty fast for Babies, it is a Good Baby Radio though, so overall funny !!! Still now working well so durable I guess !!!So all the best !Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Learning Puppy"
4,Love this toy but he just stopped working.,"This is my 20 month olds favorite toy, we call him ""Buddy"". The bad news, we haven't even had him for 6 months and he doesn't work anymore."
2,"Good: Well made, safe. Bad: Much too easy touch response- goes off when not wanted. Repeats same songs and phrases over & over","Good: Well made, safe. Bad: Much too easy touch response- goes off when not wanted. Repeats same songs and phrases over & over, ad nauseum."
3,Some technical improvements would make it better,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 1 year old, and she couldn't put it down. Educationally, it is great. However, if the baby presses the hand and it starts singing ""Patty Cake"", and the baby presses another body part, say, the foot, then ""Patty Cake"" is interrupted and ""This Little Piggy"" begins playing. It's disconcerting for adults, and I could tell it did frustrate her a little. She wants to interact and play, but she must be thinking that the dog doesn't know all the words to the songs! That's my only complaint. I do like that it has a volume control and an off button."
2,what a disappointment!!!,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS FOR MY 8 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER AFTER I HAD READ ALL THE WONDERFUL REVIEWS AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE LOVES MUSIC AND SONGS LIKE ""ITSY BITSY SPIDER""....BUT I WAS SO UPSET WHEN I GOT IT HOME AND TOOK THE PLASTIC PIECE OUT THAT MAKES IT GO FROM DEMO MODE IN THE STORE TO REGULAR PLAY AND IT STILL ONLY PLAYS A FEW WORDS OF EACH SONG AND THEN STOPS!! MY DAUGHTER STARTS TO CLAP AND SMILE WHEN SHE HEARS THE SONGS AND THEN GETS UPSET B/C IT ENDS SO ABRUPTLY. EX: IT SINGS ""THE ITSY BITSY SPIDER CLIMBED UP THE WATER SPOUT"" THEN STOPS AND SINGS ""DO YOU EARS HANG LOW, DO THE WOBBLE TO AND FRO"" THEN STOPS. I EXPECTED TO HEAR THE WHOLE SONG. WE'VE HAD IT 1 WEEK NOW AND SHE JUST CRAWLS RIGHT PAST IT AS I THINK IT UPSETS HER MORE THAN ANYTHING. I'M GOING TO CALL FISHER PRICE TO SEE IF THIS WAS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT OR IF IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY."
5,Great toy!,"My son really likes this toy and so do I. It, unlike many other toys, has many different songs and sounds that I don't get annoyed with them. One feature I really like about this is that it will help him learn his body parts. It is a really good interactive toy...I can play right along with him."
5,FANTASTIC!! can't leave home without it!,"My 14month old daughter got this for her 1st birthday and she LOVES it!! she never got attached to something really until she recieved this! I can't leave the house without it and she has to go to bed with it too. the buttons are great, she knows which one to press for what. she LOVES the music button. i would HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone!"
1,Frustrating toy!,"This puppy must have ADD - he won't finish a song if you so happen as to sneeze! He's way too sensitive! The ""off"" button on his foot is a joke! My 10 month old received this toy yesterday and we've already put it away. She doesn't seem to like it because it seriously never shuts up, so she just crawls away to her other toys. Wish I could return it. I wouldn't recommend this irritating toy to anyone!!"
4,Cute and Educational,"My 18 month old received this as a gift when he was 6 months old -- it was definitely too old for him to operate it, but he loved to hug on it and listen to it sing. Now he can operate it on it his own and enjoys it, but it doesn't occupy him for more than a few minutes at a time, wheter he's alone or whether I am playing with him. Design-wise, I don't like that it interrupts the song it's singing if you push another body part. Also, the ear broke on ours after a couple months so doesn't seem super-durable (it hasn't gone through very significant toddler wear-and-tear as much as his other toys). But in general, it's a cute toy and fun to sing along with the songs."
1,Buttons too sensitive,"My son got this when he was 8 months old. He loves music and he loves soft toys. Winner, right? Wrong! While this is a great idea, the buttons are too sensitive. Just brushing one lightly triggers the sensor, so we have a toy that is constantly interrupting itself and never finishes a song. It ends up being very frustrating to both baby and mommy. I would definitely not buy this toy until the manufacturer has fixed this glitch."
2,neeeds som work,its a cute pup but he/she is very sensitive to the touch if its singing one song and you barely touch it it turns off or changes my daughter likes it ok but it could use some imroving wish i woulda waited because now they have a pink poodle that stands and sings
2,Too Sensitive!,"The only thing your child will learn from this toy is frustration and how to say ""Bye, Bye."" The one/off button is located on the foot of the dog which is ultra sensitive. You barely set the dog down and you will ""Bye,bye"" and again by just the blow of the wind it will turn back on, ""It's learning time!"" This has to be the most annoying and useless toy I have ever bought for my son. I give it two stars because it is cute and a cute idea, it just doesn't work!"
2,Having the same trouble as everyone else...How do I get it out of demo mode?,"I read the reviews on this and half of the people were complaining about having the songs stop short. I saw people responding to them and saying ""You have to take it off of Demo Mode"". I thought to myself--I'm smart enough to figure out how to take it off of Demo Mode. Well, guess what? I've read the directions, pulled the batteries out and returned them, pressed every darn button on the thing, and can't get the songs to go full length. It's irritating for me and baby. If someone can send me directions capable of being followed by a paramecium, I will greatly appreciate it.Don't buy this toy unless you are sure you can get it out of Demo Mode....oh, I know, YOU'LL be able to do it. Good luck with that."
3,Great but not so great,"I love this toy, I bought it when the baby was 3 months old and he focused on the dog so intently. As far as keeping his attention, it was 100% great but I do agree with others, at times you can't get this thing to shut up at the slightest touch. It happened last night when we took it in the car with us. Its a great toy when they just watch it and you push the buttons, but we will see how he likes it as he gets older."
5,good,"buy it for a gift and i'm sure she is happy with it ,, and me too i liked so much is beatiful and teach kids alot thankyou... my doughter to learn with this toys she is 2 years old and she know the abc, and the color thanks to this toys."
2,Not for an 11 month old,My son has had this toy for several months and he's not the least bit interested in it. Maybe he's too young for it but he never plays with it. His friend has a my pal violet and she loves it though so I don't think that's the case. It does a lot more than this dog. Waste of money.
1,Far too sensitive!,"My daughter got this for Xmas and on the surface it looks great, however once you set it going you soon see how badly designed it is. The thing is FAR FAR too sensitive and constantly turns off and on, so all we really hear from it is ""it's learning time!"" and ""bye bye!"" but no actual content. As an educational toy it fails badly which is a shame as it has so much potential. I can't wait for the battery to run out as I'm so frustrated by it from a design point of view and hearing the constant ""bye bye"" as my daughter tries to make sense of it makes me want to throw it out of the window.I have never yet heard it finish a song, even when I take it off my baby and try to make it play a song all the way through there will be a slight draught or movement which sets it off doing something else. Really poor."
3,Laugh and Learn,My 10 month enjoys the puppy. The only issue is the puppy is very sensitive to noise and motion and won't stop playing songs even if you touch the off button.
4,Soft and cute... but I hope it can be turned OFF!,"I bought this (for half the price!) at a chain store affiliated with Amazon (hint hint) around Christmas for my nephew. It sang and asked me to hug it from the time I put it in the cart until I put it in a quiet place untouched at home. Wrapping it, again the puppy told me it loved me and wanted to play, etc. It's very soft and cuddly, so I'm sure my nephew (just turned 1) will love it, but I couldn't manage to turn the thing OFF unless I made sure it was kept motionless. Hopefully it just needed to be switched from the in-store demo mode, otherwise I feel bad for my sister!"
3,returns,"This is a great toy for an infant to toddler 3 years of age..I purchased 2 as gifts and had to return to Amazon as I was unable to wrap for they would not hush! I found these were not as exactly as pictured either..I would recommend as a great learning, fun educational toy."
2,Ultra sensistive..barely touch it and it switches to another feature!,"This toy had big potential..problem is, when my son is happily listening to a song, and he gets excited and grabs the toy, it switches to ""yellow foot"". Even at 6 months he gets disappointed and surprised with the abrupt change. It will even go off on it's own if you walk by it - not cool when the baby is sleeping! Fisher price needs to make sure you cannot switch to another song/feature, etc until the last one is finished playing. Of course kids are going to grab it and it shouldn't be sooooo sensisitve to the touch."
4,Fun learning toy.,"We had gotten one of these puppies several years ago as a gift for our daughter. So this year, we bought one for our 6-month-old nice that I babysit a few days a week. She loves her puppy. It's nice because it only talks when they push a body part and then it's quiet, so it's not one of those toys that's annoying and won't shut up. However, I got out the one that belonged to our daughter, thinking that our 15-month-old son would love it (kind of forgot we even had it until I bought one for our niece). Of course the batteries were dead since it had sat in the toy box for 2+ years. When I replaced the batteries, it still didn't work. I don't know why. Maybe something became damaged in the toy box when other toys were piled on it. I was disappointed that I couldn't get it to work!"
4,"Very cute but...won't shut up-- I mean, off.","This toy is adorable. My son loved it...he got it at 8 months old and it held his interest for a year or so. He's never been ""into"" stuffed toys, so a year is saying a lot. Extremely sensitive though. No on/off switch (though it says so on the dog's foot/paw...but move it a hair and off goes a musical, usually at the worst possible time). The voice is cute, lots of variety in the music and words. I was sad to retire it!"
2,Too sensitive and too noisy,"My daughter does like this toy pretty well (she is 16 months) but I have put it away in a closet because it is too sensitive and with even slightly brushing against it when playing with it, it will start saying something else or playing a different song so it is difficult to endure. Also, it tends to ""go off"" all by itself, which is annoying if I am trying to put her down for a nap and all of the sudden the puppy, which is across the room with nothing touching it, suddenly makes a loud noise."
4,A good options for your baby,"This toy is very nice and cute.It's a high educational value for your baby.He/she can learn colors, words, emotions."
3,Toy for my one year old,"I loved the toy, but I just recently just heard it has been recalled because it contains mercury."
2,Keep looking,"Although this toy is cute in appearance, it has many drawbacks. We actually received 2 for our daughter last Christmas. One never worked properly. The one we kept is ultra sensitive as another review states. If you barely touch any part, it will switch songs or features mid-song. Even our daughter looks at us as if to ask what's wrong with the toy. It also seems possessed as the toy goes off on its own often even when shut off. In the middle of the night it can be heard saying ""blue ear"". This is one of those toys as a parent that you wish were never in your house. The concept is great, but find another toy that has less glitches."
5,i wish i would have bought more,this is a great toy for little ones. i got it for my nephew who is a year old and i think every1 was having as much fun playing with it as he was. highly recommend this toy for any1 that has young children in thier lives
1,Way too sensitive,"My Dad bought this for my twins, and at first I thought it was a great toy. Then I realized that it changes modes, at the slightest movement - not a good idea for the recommended age range. This toy will be handed down to my nephew within the next couple of weeks."
3,used it for a long time,my baby feel asleep with this for a long time. it does get old to hear the same songs over and over again but at least she liked it. not easy to clean but thats ok.
5,Great gift,Got this for my niece a couple of years ago and she loved it. Great toy and educational as well.
1,real disappointment,"The toy was for grandson's birthday in December. He received so much, he never played with it much before it stopped working in early February!! It was a complete disappointment for me and his mother!"
2,Adorable but sensitive!,"My daughter received the pink version for her first birthday and nine months later has rarely touched it. I will say first that she has had her stuffed monkey since she was a tiny baby and never lets it out of her sight, so she doesn't take to most other stuffed animals as much. For a couple of months I didn't realize that I was suppose to switch something different in the back in order to play the whole song because it would cut off all the time. Every little touch does switch it between songs and it goes off all the time in the toy box. My daughter mainly loves the heart that lights up but that is about it."
4,fun funny dog,Is this dog haunted? It starts singing / talking w/o no stimulation.My 1 year old granddaughter loves to dance to the music.
4,Great Inexpensive Gift For A Child,Length:: 0:23 MinsYou've got to get this for the child in your life... My great-niece was playing with with this toy before the batteries were even installed.Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn' Learning Puppy'
1,Buttons Broke,"My daughter likes this toy, but it has not stood up to the normal usage of a one year old, so far both of the hands and the ear have broken. I tried calling Fisher Price to see if they could do anything for me, but the call ends up being disconnected because of ""high call volume"". I'm glad I didn't pay money for this, it was a gift. I'm very disappointed in it."
4,Tanner's mom,"My 8 month old loves this puppy, but beware...our ear didn't last a month. Also, the puppy doesn't play the entire song which is aggravating. Finally, the other reviews are dead on as far as not being able to cut the puppy off. If anything touches the puppy, he plays."
5,"""Do your ears hang low...""","Ah that is one of the songs which Puppy ""sings."" My niece received this as a gift when she was 4 months old and she L-O-V-E-S her Puppy!!! She is a sensitive child dealing with colic, acid reflux and now teething. When she gets upset and wails, squeeze puppy and instantly she will smile. She reaches out and hugs puppy, too. She is able to squeeze the feet to enable sounds and enjoys the ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"" when you press the nose a few times.Believe me after spending some time with Puppy you will be singing the songs, as well."
5,A Hit for Christmas,I bought the toy for my nephew's baby as a Christmas Gift and it was a hit! It's of good quality and easy to operate. I went online and read other people's reviews before I purchased it and they were very accurate.
5,great toy,"I love every part of this puppy. It has lots of different features, so my son does not get bored with it. The buttons are all easy to push, so even though he is too young to do it on purpose, he activates the sounds. So far it seems very well made."
5,Love this doggie!,This is a terrific toy. My eight month old twin girls love this dog. It has many songs and sounds to stimulate them and is the right size to not overwhelm them but big enough to intrigue them.
4,Smiles all around,"My 11 month old loves this toy. He smiles so big whenever it starts talking to him. I love how easy the buttons are for him to activate himself. Several of his toys have tiny buttons in the hands or feet that are really hard to push and find, but these ones are so incredibly easy to activate that they usually go off if you just touch the leg or the arm. You don't even have to touch the actual button. My only complaint would be that since it is so easy to activate, it doesn't go through an entire saying before the next saying is activated. This diminishes the toys educational value because you can't hear the whole ""Yellow Foot"" (or other sayings) before a silly song or ""Got my nose"" starts up. But both my 11 month old and my 2 1/2 year old sons love this toy."
2,Annoying,"There is not much learning involved with this toy, and it talks ALL THE TIME. It is difficult to control the functionality, and it is easy to accidentally trigger the buttons or unintentionally switch from learning mode to singing mode. This product is best with no batteries."
2,"sometimes too sensitive, sometimes not at all","My 10-mo-old son's interest for this puppy did not last. Maybe because it is just like the other toys he has, same music type, no movement and no consistent sensitivity. He touches the green hand and what he gets is ""yellow foot"". He sleeps, the puppy suddenly begins to ""speak"" without being touched but because the air conditioner is on and wakes him up.In the Amazon.com picture the puppy seems bigger than the one we got. Also our puppy is not half as pretty as the one in the Amazon.com picture. If your infant is very active and moves a lot like my son does and if you already have interactive toys that talk or make sounds and music, this toy might not be for him/her."
1,What a Headache!!!,"The puppy is cute and I thought would be great for my son (10 months)...but he isn't that thrilled with it. He'd rather play with other toys, definitely not his first choice.The reason why I gave it 1 star...it is possessed! Ok, not really...but the dog will start talking at random times during the day and night. I literally have to kick it across the room to get it to stop. The itsy-bitsy spider song is now incredibly annoying.Not recommended. There are plenty of other toys out there that could fill its shoes."
2,daughter likes it because it is a dog but overall it is not a good toy!,"Please read before you buy this toy!! We bought this toy and not only is this dog annoying because you have to be careful not to press other buttons, but the dog does not finish the songs. It would be a very nice toy if the dog finished a song such as the 'ABC's....this dog only goes up to the letter P."
1,The ADD Puppy,"Maybe I got a dud, but we call this the ""ADD puppy"" because it can't get through a sentence without changing course! The buttons are on a hair trigger and as soon as you touch one it changes what it's doing. So my daughter will be holding it and listening to a song she likes and then accidentally touch another button and it says ""whoops, got my toes!"" and stops. You have to set it down and not touch it if you want to hear a whole song. Also, if you don't turn the switch off, it comes on totally by itself. In the middle of the night."
1,not so happy,"The toy was purchased for a nephew for christmas. Upon receiving it the toy didn't work. I'm sure it would have been fun to play with and very educational for that matter, IF IT WORKED."
2,cute puppy,"My son got this for his 1st b-day and he played with it once or twice.Its a cute puppy ,but it does not keep him entertained.Its very sensitive and goes off with a easy touch.If anyone wants this puppy let me know.[...] maryland"
2,"My son didn't like it, and I hated the voice","I bought this for my son when he six months old. I didn't expect him to be able to play with it much at that age, so it sat on the shelve till he was a year old and when I reintroduced it to him at a 13 months old, he didn't want anything to do with, to tell you the truth I was sorta happy that he didn't, becuase the puppy's voice really annoyed me. I could hardly stand it. I tried to give it to him to play with a couple more times over the months and he never took intrest, so I give it away."
3,Goes off repeatedly in the middle of the night when nothing is touching it!,"All three of my one year old grandchildren LOVE this puppy...but...it goes off randomly in the middle of the night, even when we make sure that nothing is touching it. It says a random phrase or two, says bye-bye, and immediately starts over again and again until we get up, turn it off manually, put it in the office and close the door. I could tolerate it changing songs before they're over, but we've lost too much sleep over this thing!"
2,Too sensitive,"Great idea, but the buttons were too sensitive. He would go off when no one was touching him, and if you just brushed a part of his body with a sensor, he would switch songs in the middle of one song. I thought maybe it was just mine, but two friends had the same experience."
5,Baby Loves this,"My 8-month old daughter loves this. She got it for Christmas and at first liked to listen to it, but couldn't push any of the buttons to make it play (she was 4 months then). Now that she can sit up on her own and really play with it it's even more exciting for. She smiles and laughs. I love also that it has both a learning mode that does colors and body parts and stuff and also a musical mode (she loves music)."
3,Too sensitive!!!,"We ordered this toy from Amazon after my daughter played with the one at her Oma's so much and she loved it. This one however arrived in fair condtion. it is WAY to sensitive for us to really play with it. My duaghter played and laughed with it for two days now ignores it. It is hard to finishe a song because it you are playing with it while it is talking it easly switches to the next activity without finishing what it started. TOO sensitve and anoying!!! It could be just the one we recieved though. I have leaned that it is better to buy in a store where you can TEST the product first to make sure it works before you bring it home! Great for early education or colors, body parts and music/song."
1,annoying dog,"My sister-in-law gave this to my daughter for her 1st birthday. The recorded voice on the dog is so cloying and syrupy sweet it can give you cavities just listening to it. Maybe others wouldn't mind that over-eager baby voice because a lot of kid products feature similar voices, but that's not the only problem. The real issue is that there's no way to truly turn it off. If you touch the OFF button on its foot is says ""bye bye!"" but then if you touch any ear, paw, nose etc. it goes right back into action saying ""it's learning time!"" or ""got my nose, woof woof!"" It's NEVER off. There's no turning it off. I've bumped into it crossing the baby's room in the dark after checking her in the night and the dang thing starts playing the ""itsy bitsy spider"" song at full bore -- of course my child sits up screaming in fright. I think the product is ill-conceived and if you are the sort of person who doesn't appreciate that kiddie voice, it WILL drive you nuts."
1,Maybe I'm missing something...?,"I bought this as an angel tree gift for a local kids' charity, but I will be returning it. Admittedly I have not put too much effort into looking at it, but the box clearly states that the alphabet learning song is A-Z, which seems obvious. Unless another button needs pressed to finish the alphabet, the song only goes to about P. That's rather useless and stupid."
1,Creep-o Puppy,"I got this toy for my son when he was 9 months old. He seems to like it ok but it gives me the creeps. It is super sensitive and turns on with the slightest touch but only plays a few lines at a time. Occasionally it turns on by itself in the middle of the night or when it is in a room by itself. It is really creepy to wake up at 3am to the sound of ""This little puppy went to market."" Plus,it gets annoying really quickly.I'm gifting this creep-o puppy asap. I HATE it."
4,Love it!,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas and she love it. It's very nice toy, fisher price did it again. I want to buy one for my friend's daughter but it's out of stock so that means lot's of people bought it.Great toy!"
3,Yeah I agree the options change instantly!,Not that its bad...but the push bottons change very instantly. So there's no continuity to any song for that matter. My daughter gets frustrated and doesn't know how to get back to the same song again. A little flaw with that!
4,laugh and learn puppy,"My daughter loves the laugh and learn puppy, the only problem is the bone that lights up doesn't work any more."
5,Whole Lotta Fun,"The songs are catchy with lyrics children can quickly grasp and a sense of humor that will entertain parents, as well. A must-have for your kids!"
4,"Beats ""Wheels on the Bus"" anyday!","Not having kids, I find most kids music annoying and I have very little patience. But putting in the CD I Love My Toys was actually NOT annoying as a grown up. I sent one right off to my 6 year old neice and told her to stop listening to that stupid dinosaur!"
5,It's refreshing to hear a children's CD with such great song,"It's refreshing to hear a children's CD with such great songwriting. All the songs are catchy and I can't get a couple out of my head. I believe parents will enjoy the CD as much as their children, they'll be playing it a hundred times a day! Jesse Smith has created a FUN and ENTERTAINING children's CD with great lessons, and positive values."
4,excellent product for a trivial price,"This cassette player is a dream come true for a music lover who wants to quench his thirst for good music but has a limited budget. Even at such a low price the product does not lack in features. It boasts of several good facilities like anti roll mechanism and auto reverse, which gets rid of the hassle to rewind the cassette everytime after listening and also produces a good quality music.The extra big volume controller in front gives a novel and comfortable grip, also facilitating fine volume adjustments.What more it also comes with a headphone with a very decent sound quality. The inbuilt radio has a strong reception and the sound quality of FM is adorable.The headphone wire which doubles up as an antenna is the reason for this exceptional reception quality. In short I would recommend this product to every music lover with a taste for original music."
1,Terrible quality,"I bought this product to run and listen to local radio stations, while I run.It it a terrible product. After the first run, the headphones shorted out. I can only get reception on one of the two earphones. The tuning is poor.If you need a device for one or two uses (a temporary radio/tape receiver) it is probably fine -- and the price is definately right. If you want something that lasts longer, go to another product/brand.This is a throw away product only."
4,Great sound,"This stereo has great sound. I take it to the gym. The only problem with it is when I move around, the headphones go in and out. When it stays put, the sound works very well.I like the large volume button in front.It gets a little confusing knowing which direction the tape is going when I want to rewind or fast forward."
1,Speed probably slow,"I have the model without auto reverse- C3125- and the tape speed is too slow, a common problem with portables. Aiwa is best for normal tape speeds."
3,Acceptable,"Good for the price, I guess. Though if I could take it back, I'd get a more expensive one instead."
2,"children, women, and AIDS","This may be a textbook for nursing students, but I think everyone would find it fairly readable. At the time this book was written, AIDS was mostly a disease of adult men; thus, women and children with the virus were a minority within a minority. This book has more chapters on children than women and I wish the opposite was the case. There is only one chapter on international HIV-positive women and children: this may bother some people since that is the population in which the illness is most rampant. This book has lots of useful facts in it (but remember that it was written a decade ago). It discussed how AIDS affect reproduction, healt care providers, and family structures. People concerned about women and children with AIDS could really employ this as a good reference for educating the public."
3,Not That Good,"The reading of this book was incredibly hard, I purchased it wanting a good history of the CFL (being interested as an American) but I did not want to read a ""thesis"" about the CFL. It is obvious the author has done his research on the subject but I would not recommed it to a casual fan wanting to know about this League. I also do not like its' cover with the grave markers beind that two of the leagues represented are technically still around (the AFL and AAFC)."
2,Looks great when you first put it on but,"it doesn't stay on. I found that I had to reapply it after only about an hour.For my money, Maybelline's Mousse foundation is the best."
4,Works Fine - bit heavy,"This has a nice dispenser so you get just what you need and it isn't messy. It does go on thickly and I recommend loose powder to soften the heaviness. I chose Creamy Natural shade and it ended up being a shade too dark for my fair skin.It does stay on for most of the day, though. I just don't like the heaviness as much"
2,Greasy looking after an hour,"This makeup leaves my face looking oily and greasy looking after 1 hr, it dosent blend well at all, and I just got it because it was cheaper but will go back to my old fav!!"
4,Great Coverage,This product really does a good job covering imperfections! I love it and would purchase it again without a doubt.
5,Just Awesome. (But you don't believe it.),"Great songs, great delivery, great voice. But why Oh why - in every single live version of COME SAIL AWAY after Dennis says ""Think of childhood friends, and the dreams we had"" why does he always have to ""ad lib"" WE HAD DREAMS! It is SO ANNOYING - Dennis - if you're reading- stop talking SO MUCH throughtout your music! We love it - we don't need the Jay Leno approach!"
5,Classic music made new,"This is NOT a live CD by an aging has-been that is simply rehashing songs from years ago just to make some bucks. ""Live with Symphony Orchestra"" takes the songs from Dennis DeYoung's catalog of hits and makes them fresh and exciting like you have never heard them before. The orchestra is not there as background music; rather an integral part of the performance, working well with the musicians in Dennis' band. The music selections include DeYoung-penned hits from Styx, his solo work, and two selections from a musical Dennis wrote based on ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"". There are also three new studio songs, showing that Dennis has not lost his songwriting abilitilies."
3,"too ""operetic""","Was looking for ""calming"" children's songs that I remember as a child. Although the songs/music were wonderful and brought back childhood memories, the voice was too much like an opera voice. I wanted calming music for my grandson."
3,"Not as funny as ""More Items from our Catalogue""","I've been looking in second hand bookshops for years for this, and I finally found it a few weeks ago. I'm a bit disappointed that its not as hilarious as the subsequent ""More Items from our Catalogue"". I have managed to raise a few wry smiles while I read it, compared to consistently cracking up in hysterics each time I get out ""More Items from our Catalogue"". The author became much more creative and outrageous in the second book."
5,A cow's stomach of hilarious products,"I've been buying L.L. Bean products since the 1950's and this catalog spoof is one of the funniest things I have ever read. I have both ""catalogs"" and to me ""Items...."" is better than ""More Items..."". Very entertaining and I laugh every time I read it anew. By the way, L.L. Bean really does stand behind its products."
2,Why Combo?,I dont think it was necessary to have Part 1 and 2 on a combo pack. I would rather just have part 1.
3,A VERY POORLY RECORDED ALBUM,Hard to believe it's been 25 years since Steve checked out and that his legacy hasn't been better preserved. The sound quality of this CD is pathetic and needs badly to be remastered. It reminds me of listening to the AM dial on an old cheap transistor radio.
3,blahhhhhhh,"My little boy loves videos like this and has been begging for this one. We are use to buying the ""mighty machine"" ones, which are fabulous, and I thought this one might be good. NOT. He does not pay any attention to it and the education level is minimal."
1,just jumbo jets taking off and landing,"I bought all 3 of these videos, the first 2 are good. They have action with stunt planes, jets, helicopters etc... this 3rd DVD is soooooo boring it is only jumbo jets ""commercial planes"" taking off and landing. Bought these for my autistic son who loves planes, jets, and helicopters. He does not like this video either, he watched it for about 5 minutes and then was bored. He loves the first 2 videos and watches them a lot. I do not recommend wasting your money on this video."
3,Indians in Pennsylvania,"Over, I found the book to be interesting and informative. However, it did not provide much information regarding Indians in western Pennsylvania which was my main interest."
5,Full of Information and Practical Tantra Practice,"I bought this DVD in hopes of improving my already very good spiritual and sexual intimacy with my husband. This DVD offers a Dr. that speaks naturally, comfortably, and confidently about a subject she clearly knows. She speaks at a normal rate and is totally believable. The couples look like normal everyday people.I learned a lot from the Dr. and the information has already proved itself to be valuable in fostering a greater spiritual and sexual intimacy connection for me and my husband.It is a good companion DVD to have with some of the Tantra books I am reading. I recommend this purchase."
2,Sockets seemed nice but ratchet arrived defective,"I was looking forward to getting this socket set and was disappointed when it came with a ratchet handle that would not change directions. Amazon could not replace the set because it was now out of stock.I contacted SK Tools to see if I could get a replacement ratchet. I was told it was out of stock, but they would send me a repair kit in 8 to 12 weeks--not an acceptable resolution. I returned the set to Amazon. Disappointed in what I thought was a solid brand."
3,Almost ok,"All items were ok, except for the pouch carryng case that is not for the Motorola Razor V3."
3,NO NO NO,"Not what I thought, This is more on the line of a toy then a tool. The service was quick and delivery time awesome. But the item did not live up to my expectations. I would not buy this again."
4,"Works , Very Easy","This is a fast and cheap way to sharpen lawnmower blades. This is my 2nd sharpener and does a very good job. Only purchase if you are going to use a corded drill, a lot easier to complete the job...Don't forget the eye protection."
2,Defective but usable,"--Early Review--I've only used this item once and during the course of sharpening the lawn mower blade the screw on the top of the sharpener fell off, I have to tighten it every now and then during the course of using it. It would appear they need to include a spring washer to hold the screw in place instead of the flat washer used."
1,Vermont Am. Lawn mower blade sharpner not sturdy,Although the sharpner did sharpen my blades the plasic leverer broke the first time I used it. It can still be used but it's no where as useful without it. I also purched the Dremel sharpener and it is much better worked great. I would not recommend buying this item.
3,used meant written in,"I chose this address book because of the illustrations and that it was a good price and marked used. However, I did not realize that used meant had been written in by another owner."
2,I wish she would sing original songs....,"Yuridia has a beautiful voice. That is undisputed. But this CD doesn't fully showcase the strength of it. I wasn't too fond of her first CD... I bought this one hoping she'd matured since but it has yet to happen. Most of the songs on this album are lackluster. Three captivated me... including (and surprisingly) a cover of Sarah Maclachlan's Angel (in Spanish) which she nailed with such perfection, but mostly, the album is dull. It's not all her fault... it's also the arrangements on the songs. Boring for the most part. I hope her next CD embarks on original music from her. She sings ""The Rose"" in English... (which Bette Midler made famous) but it didn't seem that Yuridia put much effort into it, surprising given the fact she does speak English rather well. Great range and potential... just poorly guided is best I can summarize. Hopefully she can get out of this funk by her next album."
2,"TO BE HONEST, THIS CD IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH","I love her first cd,but this cd is not good.I have heard it severals times and it lacks of something.It is known for every fan of Yuridia that she has a powerfull voice. Besides, this cd contains more covers!!! c'mon.Suggestion.I would have made some cover not to known. some cover from Monica Naranjo from her past cd's,like ""ty yo volvemos al amor"" "" miedo"" ""amando locamnete"".or songs of dulce, Daniela Romo etc..The ""habla el corazon"" are songs that we have listened severasl times in other voices.you should have picked up better songs than this that you offer in this ""brand new cd""I hope the next cd. it will be a real cd."
3,For a co-worker...,"who adores this product. I cannot vouch, but am grateful once again for such a quick response to processing my order!Cereta/Quantum"
3,Ok,"I like these. I like the bold lines. But for drawing, I had trouble getting consistent lines. I mean the ball would stick sometimes. Tried all four pens and all did this.I recomment the Faber-Castell 8 PITT artist pens in black for the ultimate doodle pens! :)"
4,Expensive but Nice,"I love the way these disposable pens write. Very smooth, consistent, and bold. As a land surveyor, I also use them to sign mylar drawings and they seem reliably indelible. Expensive, but nice."
3,Good Introduction,"This book offers a good introductory overview of different ways people have tried to approach God. One of the best things about the book are the review questions for each chapter, which reinforces the ideas in each chapter. The book is intended to be for those who have very little or no experience in philosophy. He takes time to explain the jargon for those who may not know it. The conclusions he draws aren't exactly the same ones I would draw, but this book serves as an introduction to the subject of trying to know God (and how we can know Him). This isn't my first choice for a book on this subject, but its better than alot of others people pick up instead."
3,Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat,After reading some great reviews for this top coat I decided to buy it and try it. It works okay - it does dry super fast and goes on really well. But it does chip within the first couple of days - just normal activities and it does chip. But it arrived very quickly and Amazon always does a good job with returns. But I will keep it and continue to use it.
3,Normal,There was not anything extra special about this top coat nail polish. Its not better than other nail coats out there.
5,Outbursts of Joy!,"If Messiaen's Transports de joie was on here it would truly be an outburst of joy. But, he already did that on a complete Messiaen disc! It was thrilling to hear Olivier Latry in recital - now I can hear him in the comfort of home playing many of the pieces on the recital program 'from memory'. The Prokofiev and Rachmaninoff were impressive live and recorded. The sound is remarkably crystal clear and sounds incredible on a BOSE system. My first purchase of music on Amazon.com and a new satisfied customer I am."
3,Beware: This review is biased.,"The sound quality is superb. The selected transcriptions were interesting and appropriate. The surround mix is great. Mr. Latry plays with a lot of feeling and confidence.Why I included the bias warning: I just don't personally like the sound of the Cathedral de Notre-Dame. To my ears, it doesn't produce the same tones as the classic German organs (the Trost Organ in Waltershausen, Germany and the Cathedral at Freiburg come to mind)...it almost sounds Overly upgraded and modernized. Like I said, my comments are as a result of my personal listening preferences. Others may disagree."
5,Practically new,Book arrived later than I thought but it was the Christmas season so one has to take that into consideration. (It's the end of Jannuary now and I'm still getting xmas cards :S) The book is in mint condition! It's my first purchase on amazon so I'm well satisfied. Thanks!
3,"Good, but a bit of a letdown after ""First Man in Rome""","When I read the first the author's series on Rome, I remember more late nights and stolen moments as read it. THE GRASS CROWN, however, although similar in tone and scope, simply didn't capture my attention as much.Still, McCullough shows her own mastery of Rome and its history and is able to weave history and narrative together into an enjoyable, well researched book, and, although I didn't enjoy it as much as the first in the series, I'd recommend it to others and will continue reading on into additional books in the series."
3,Book With No Cover,"A little disappointed when the book arrived with no cover, which made for a pretty old, ugly looking book. I bought it for my son who is a boat fanatic, and he enjoyed the inside reading material, but would have been nice to have had the cover with the Donzi boat like was pictured."
5,So far so good!,I bought these to use in making nut and rice milks and so far so good. I just wish they would fit over to the top of my container so I don't have to hold the bag with one hand and pour with the other but this is a minor inconvenience. They rinse and wash up well and dry super quickly. They've held up to 12 batches of almond milk so far including wringing them to get every last drop out.
2,Not Good For Jelly,"These ""jelly bags"" don't strain anything nearly fine enough to make jelly. I wound up using a grease strainer to finish my apple jelly juice; these were a complete disappointment. I don't know why they bother to say the bags are even for jelly. Ridiculous. You could drive a truck through the weave."
3,Ennui merrily go,"So bleak. Dazai writes about the dissolution of a single aristocratic Japanese family, and he does a great job of showing the sad, helpless position that lower aristocrats of any nationality usually find themselves in. They're lost between a quickly disintegrating past and future that has no real interest in or place for them. Suicide comes up a lot in this book. Yet it never felt shocking or surprising. It seems inevitable that they will all end up compromised, broken, and dead. What did surprise me were the occasional christian allusions that pop up in the book which I guess, as someone who admittedly has a shallow understanding of Japanese culture, I just don't much expect. Of course even these are tinged by the pessimism and impending doom that runs through the whole book."
5,I love this book!,"I received this as a gift and have made over a dozen of the recipes. The grilled swordfish with lemon aioli is to die for! There are some great suggestions for how to plan, prepare and organize dinner parties. Starting with an empty dishwasher is one of them - it's so simple yet it makes a world of difference. The recipes are relatively simple and have been consistently very good. Out of the 20 or so cookbooks I have - this is my favorite."
5,Such a gem!,"I have a slew of cookbooks, but when I'm looking for something delicious and innovative, I turn to this cookbook. Ms. Maggipinto knows how to put together menus that are not only delicious but also full of surprises. Most of her recipes are easy enough for the novice cook, although some take the time and trouble that experienced cooks do not shy away from when planning a spectacular dinner party. She has a way with vegetables; try for example swiss chard with garlic and balsamic or baked zucchini with Parmesan. Simple and simply delicious!"
3,Bull's Birds of New York,"If you are trying to identify birds, this book is pretty worthless, there are about 5 pictures and they are black and whites sketches. If identifying birds is your aim buy another book....or buy a book in conjunction with this"
4,sturdy toddler fun,"This sturdy little book contains eight pages. The narrative loosely follows a fire truck as it leaves the station and rescues a cat from a tree. Each page has a moving part, and these are entertaining to kids who've only seen lift-the-flaps. There are four flaps as well as a firefighter sliding down a pole, the truck going down a hill, hubcaps turning and the truck's ladder lifting to the cat.This board book is heavy and sturdy. Flaps may be torn, but other moving parts aren't going anywhere!"
5,Cute Book,"Cute book for any little boy who loves trucks!! My 3 year old loves this book, especially the moving parts in it. We actually checked it out of the library a while back and he was so sad when we had to return it, I came here to buy a copy for him."
5,Just in time...,I was extremely happy with the condition of the book. I had a very worn copy before this but gave it as a gift. A few days after I gave mine away I realized how much I used this book and carried it with me so I needed another copy and I needed it quick. The best thing about my order is I got it a day before my birthday! I would be happy to order from this person again!
3,wordy,"There are some great observations in here, if you can wade through the subjective hoo-ha. You might want to pick up a beret to wear while you read this."
4,"Wonderful, but I wish the zipper would work!","I love this mix and I use it for everything. I like baking with it better than with wheat flour.HOWEVER, I sure wish they would fix the zipper on the 4lb bags. Drives me nuts. I can never get them to close properly."
5,Pamela's Baking Mix,"My son has Celiac Sprue and this is absolutely the best gluten free baking mix I've ever tried! Products bake well and just as importantly, the taste is not just tolerable, it is great!!!"
2,Wanted to like this but taste is too odd,I really wanted to like this mix and have tried several different ways to help the taste of the mix. My daughter and neighbor kids do not like this for pancakes. Had several other friends and family try the pancakes but all did not like the taste at all. I really had high hopes for the mix due to the great reviews but I do want to be fair for other shoppers and explain that the taste of this mix may not be for everyone.
5,"Best Gluten-free baking mix, hands down","I don't have Celiac's, but my wife does and I've chosen to live a GF lifestyle to make it easier for our family. My wife makes pumpkin chocolate chip cookies with this mix, and I make pancakes.. we've made cakes and all sorts of goodies. Let me tell ya, we've tried tons of different mixes and this is the ONLY one that makes me feel like I'm eating good old fashioned home cookin! There are already over 350 reviews for this product with a virtually flawless 5-star score, but I just had to add my vote to the mix (no pun intended) -- there is nothing so great as Pamela's."
3,ALLERGY CAUTION - ALMONDS,"Rated this product 3 as it didn't seem fair to give it a bad ding since I couldn't even try it.I was looking forward to trying this product only to find that it contains Almonds. This information is not listed here. Thank goodness I read the label before baking.I'm glad that it works for so many, wish it did for me but felt it important that others know so they don't waste their money - it isn't returnable."
5,Great Stuff,"Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is by far the best gluten free product I have ever used. I recommend it to anyone, even those that do not need gluten free products."
5,Best glutan-free,"This is simply the best-tasting gluten-free mix available. Has an excellent flavor and texture, not gritty at all like so many others. Nobody can tell it's wheat-free, and I've made pancakes for a lot of people! I do add an extra egg and some sour cream and this mix makes heavenly pancakes."
5,It's the best!,I'm so glad I found this mix. Each recipe I try I have loved. I can't get enough of the scones. I get compliments on them all the time!
5,Enjoying Baking Again,"This is the best product I have found for my family, four out of five of us do not tolerate flour very well. My daughter, lives in Deleware now, she sent me three4 lb. bags, I am so glad she did. I love to bake, we are now enjoying some very tasty bake goods. Thanks so much for an excellant product.Joanna Kokomo,IN"
5,Easy and tasty biscuits,"Purchased to give to a friend recently diagnosed with celiac disease. Had to try before giving it to her. I used cold butter instead of shortening when I made this. (I'm a butter lover.) I made six biscuits, perfect size for one person (my husband hates homemade biscuits). So good I ate four of them right away. They have a different taste than regular biscuits but very pleasing and as drop biscuits easy to make. I haven't made any other recipes with the mix but if the biscuits are any indication, this will be good. I will be using this even though I don't have to eat gluten free."
4,Great pancake mix; good baking mix,"I really like Pamela's pancake mix. It's easy and the pancakes taste very good. I usually add blueberries or mini chocolate chips. As a baking mix, it's ok. I've made great banana bread but the muffins and the drop biscuits are pretty crumbly. However, I love how easy it is to use and it tastes good."
5,Pamela's Ultimate Baking mix,"I have used Pamela's baking mix for pancakes, waffles, biscuits, pizza crust and scones. I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful flavor of everything I made using this mix. There are lots of recipes on Pamela's web site, which is listed on the package."
4,Pamelas ultimate baking and pancake mix,"Makes excellent waffles, and fairly good chocolate chip cookies, haven't used it for any other items of late. so far it seems to do what it says with reasonable flavor"
5,Pamela's Baking Mix,"TheThe BEST!!!!!! I wouldn't want to be a ""Celiac"" without Pamela's!! It has certainly solved many of my cooking problems---"
5,awesome!,"product is so so so amazing!!!! we even bought it for a friend, and the price is great also! will be ordering all the time!"
5,The best Pancakes ever,I love Pamela's Glueten free Pancake mix. I thought I would never give up Bisquick since that is what I was raised on. But Bisquick has met its match! Those with wheat alergies will love it and those who don't will too.
5,Can't Life Without It!,"I use this mix for all baking and cooking -- I use it 100% replacement for flour in corn bread, fruit cobblers even breadding meat before frying or baking. It is amazing and worth every penny!"
5,The best GF pancakes AND chocolate chip cookies,"I have been GF for 5+ years, there are some products that you buy once in a while to ""splurge"" there are some products that have a purpose (puffed rice for example) but not much more...This is a product that I ALWAYS have on hand. Makes (even non-celiacs agree!) THE BEST pancakes ever (I add mini chocolate chips...). A spectacular chocolate chip cookie, great crepes, nice muffins, ....everything. If you haven't tried it, buy now. Welcome to the world of gourmet GF at home."
5,These make amazing waffles!!!,"Awhile ago I set out to cut back the gluten in our house. This is one of the products I found to try. It makes the most amazing waffles ever!!! Once we had these waffles, Pamelas became a permanent part of our kitchen. All my kids love them, they have protein from the eggs and are super, super easy. I also use this if a recipe calls for flour, like a gravy, etc. It works great. No one would believe its gluten-free! I will say that its not a 100% health product. Its about half white rice and half brown from what I can tell. So its not a ""whole grain"" product. We make the waffles about once a week or every other week, as a treat. top with organic jelly or raw honey!"
5,Gluten-free baking mix,"We love Pamela's G-F Baking Mix! We use it for biscuits, pancakes, cakes, etc. It's so easy to make delicious gluten-free baked things for our family."
5,Great gf mix,"Pamela's is a great mix! I use it not only for pancakes, but it also make great biscuits, waffles and loaf cakes."
5,good stuff !,I had mediocre expectations for this item....its exceeded my hopes for a great baking mix.....I made the zucchini bread on the back of the package and added some chocolate chips...its incredible.I also added an additional 1/2 tsp per loaf of baking powder since I wasn't sure it would rise enough. It came out perfect.The cake freezes well....I tripled the recipe ! I'm looking forward to making more things with it :)
5,Cindy,"When I first bought this mix for my husband who has celiac disease, I only made pancakes. Then I bought a Cuisinart waffle maker and tried the waffle recipe on the bag - spectacular! We went camping with our adult children and grandkids who have no dietary restrictions, and I could not make the waffles fast enough. There is also a carrot cake recipe on the bag that I use to make carrot muffins, and then freeze them. My husband can have a carrot muffin with his coffee anytime he wants a snack. It is wonderful to have such a good versatile product on the shelf for anyone - whether they suffer from celiac disease or not. Buying from Amazon make the work of difference to know that you can always get that specialized product delivered to your door with free shipping. Thanks Pamela and Thanks Amazon!!!"
4,pamela's baking mix is great!,I really enjoy my gluten free cooking and baking with Pamela's. Works well in many of my old recipes as well as those on the bag and at their website. The price with auto ship is amazing compared to grocery or health food stores. thanks Amazon! thanks Pamela!
5,One Word - FANTASTIC!,"This is a great all around baking mix to have on hand. We love the cookies, cakes, and pancakes you can make with this mix. The recipes are simple and she offers more online. We always find regular recipes and substitute this flour. Each and every time our recipes turn out great. I have taken my various recipes where I used Pam's Baking Mix and I have had alot of compliments. People who don't eat gluten free don't ever know the difference."
5,Finally! I can have waffles and not get sick!,"For years I haven't felt well, dealt with all sorts of symptoms that all gluten-sensitive, gluten-intolerant or celiac sufferers know all too well. On the advise of a friend, I have eliminated gluten from my diet and have been feeling amazingly well! But I sure missed waffles. I ordered Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix and made waffles for breakfast this morning. It is wonderful to be able to enjoy one of my favorite breakfast foods and not be in pain afterward! And they were delicious! Now to order the other Pamela's products!"
5,Good Gluten Free Pancakes,Pamel's Untimate Baking and Pancake Mix is the a pancake mix that makes gluten free pancakes that taste like regular pancakes. I have also used it to make biscuits. You can't cut them out but if you make drop biscuits they taste real good.
5,Absolutely the best gluten free mix ever,"Pamela's baking and pancake mix is versatile and makes wonderful waffles, scones and pancakes. I serve them to non-celiac folks, and they can't tell the difference!"
5,Wonderful baking mix!,"We love this mix. We use if mostly for pancakes, and the kids love them! One of the only GF mixes we like!"
3,Great MIX! Shipping could be better,"Product is fantastic and cheaper than buying the small bags at the grocery store. I get 3 packages. Two of the three packages had holes at the top, from what I could assume is an automated pick system, but were still fresh etc. Looked like a shipping / packing error in which they were punctured. I taped up the little holes and stuck one in the freezer to keep it fresh. I'd give more stars, but since two were somewhat damaged, I deducted from that. I will still purchase more after these are finished. Great product!!!"
4,Eat Up,"A little pricey but good for your health.You had the best price that I have found.Thank you, Tom"
2,I liked Bob's Red Mill better,"Personally, I prefer the gluten free products from Bob's Red Mill. This one didn't taste as good or as fresh. I will stick with Bob's."
5,excelent product,This product is a must have for anyone who is gluten intolerent.This mix is versitle. I have tried many of Pamela's recipes and they all come out. My husband who does not have food allergies loves the pancakesthat you can make with this mix. He prefers them to the wheat counter part. I do too.
5,the secret ingredient is almond meal,"This is, by far, the best gluten-free bake mix I have tried. I believe the almond meal makes the batter richer and more flavorful than many others made primarily from rice flours. Also, the end products, be they cookies, crepes or muffins, are not so crumbly and hard to eat. I highly recommend this product to all who must eat gluten-free!"
5,Excellent,"I highly recommend this product if you are a gluten free family. we use it for everything, not just pancakes. its great for breading on chicken and fish. Muffins too. Plus, if you buy in bulk from Amazon, you save a lot."
5,Great for breakfast or for dinner.,"My husband and I really like Pamela's pancake mix. The pancakes are delicious. They cook up so much better than store bought mixes and are so quick and easy. I have made the muffins from the mix and they too are really good. Our daughter-in-law prepares them for our grandchildren and they like them a lot. She had cooked them for us on a visit last year and that got us hooked!Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix, 64-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)Anytime we can't decide on ""what's for dinner?"" I pull out a bag of Pamela's pancake mix."
5,Best gluten free product ever used,"Ever since discovering Pamela's products, I feel like I died and went to Heaven. Her gluten free pancake and baking mix, makes wonderful waffles and pancakes. You can use this mix with any of your own recipes, and they taste wonderful. My grandchildren and many friends never new that my Christmas cookies were gluten free. It makes a pie crust that is to die for, and again I have served it without saying it was gluten free, and I got rave reviews from those that ate it. I can't say enough about her baking and pancake mix, and all of her packaged products as well. I LOVE Pamela's products. PS Her wheat free bread mix is also excellent"
5,Wonderful Gluten Free Mix,"Not having the time or energy to create my own gluten free mixes, this one is perfect! I can quickly make ""from scratch"" baked items. The recipes on the bag, as well as on the website, are great! When I had to go gluten free I probably missed biscuits the most. The biscuit recipe on the back is extremely easy and enjoyed by all!"
5,Best Biscuits Ever!,"I don't rate products much, but this morning I had the best biscuits ever. Wife and son are gluten, egg, dairy and soy free. We used to love biscuits and gravy but since they went gluten free years ago we haven't had them. We have used Pamela's for pancakes but this morning I decided to try biscuits and gravy... Fantastic. I used butter instead of shortening (soy) and rice milk for both the biscuits and sausage gravy. Did I mention they were fantastic!"
5,Delicious!!,"I don't have celiac's disease, however I have wheat sensitivities which is just as painful and uncomfortable. I found this mix several months ago as I hadn't had pancakes in 5 years, the flavor is out of this world. The combination of ingredients cause the flavors to burst in your mouth, it almost makes ""regular"" pancakes boring. My husband eats these also, and his doesn't have a problem with wheat!! I pay about $6 for 24oz at the local store, THIS IS A GOOD BUY!!"
5,Gluten-free baked goods that actually taste great!,"When I eliminated gluten from my diet a few years ago, I cleaned out my cupboards of anything that contained that menacing little protein. I bought (and mixed) countless flours and grains trying to find a good substitute for all-purpose flour. Every flour and blend that I tried produced baked goods that were either tough and rubbery or mealy and crumbly. No amount of recipe-tweaking produced anything that I could happily feed to guests. Enter Pamela's Ultimate Baking & Pancake Mix. Now I can serve fluffy and delicious pancakes, bake awesome quick breads, and create yummy coatings for pan-frying. It's been a while since I ordered so the packaging may have changed since then, but my bags are printed with nine different recipes, which gave me a good place to start."
4,Good tasting pancakes,"This have a good taste for gluten free but better if you add some fruit, peanut butter, spices or chocolate chips. Not too heavy tasting like some mixes are."
5,Love this mix!,"So far, we've only used it for pancakes and waffles, but I love it. I can whip up a double batch of the pancakes or waffles so quickly and then freeze the rest. There are so little ingredients to add and it makes it so easy! My friends have made the banana muffins which they loved and other items."
5,Pamela Cooks,"This is a good product for those who are gluten free. It works well for many recipes, and widens the list of foods available. There are good recipes for it, but it works for a cooks experimenting desires, too!"
5,Gluten-free baking,Excellent for pancakes and baking. I have tried almost all the recipes on the bag and they all taste great!
5,The best gluten free product out there.,"These are great, you would never think they were gf, I totally endorse this product. Just in one simple word...delicious."
5,Picky Eater Begs for More,My son is 7 and a picky eater and he LOVES this mix. He can't get enough of these waffles! This is a blessing for kids who need a special diet.We added ground cinnamon and apples to the mix for a comparable version of the premade frozen version.
5,Best GF Baking Mix,"This mix is great! The bag has many recipes to try and because it includes the baking soda and baking powder it's very quick and simple to use. My kids Love the pancakes and muffins, and don't mind that it's GF!"
5,Very pleased,"I decided to try this as we are trying to get away from processed white flour. I have tried several of the recipes and really like them. The chocolate chip cookies are a little fragile, probably because I made them with brown sugar/Splenda but they were delicious. The waffles were very good, better than those made with white flour. The coffee cake is very good although I think I will use less filling next time. It turned out very sweet and somewhat crumbly but I was using brown/sugar Splenda again. I am definitely going to make this mix a staple in our household."
3,I love the product just not the shipping care.,I love Pamela's products. This product is awesome as so is all her products. I just ordered Pamela's baking mix and bread mix the other day and it just showed up yesterday and all 6 bags in two separate boxes had two small puncture holes in all the bags in the same spot. The holes had to have been made at Pamela's packaging warehouse because they were packaged in Pamela's shipping boxes. I called amazon and reported it to them and they were very nice and refunded my money.I would have given this product a five star but for the packaging issue from Pamela's i gave it three stars.
1,Does Not Make Good Pancakes,I'm shocked to see such great reviews for this product. Admittedly I have only used this mix to make pancakes but they were just not good so I'm hesitant to try making anything else with it.I love Bob's Red Mill gluten free pancake mix and recommend it over Pamela's.
5,THE BEST of Gluten-Free,"I was blown away by how amazing this baking mix is. I made the recipes on the back of the bag and they were incredible. I have been sensitive to gluten for years and have tried EVERY gluten-free product out there. Once you try this stuff, your search for a good flour substitute will be over. Guaranteed. The simple drop biscuits actually puff up and are light and delicious (I added garlic powder, oregano, and shredded cheese to approximate the Red Lobster biscuits - they didn't disappoint!) The pancakes/waffles are fluffy and wonderful, and they even freeze and reheat (toaster) perfectly. My 1 year old loves this stuff and you will too. Thank you Pamela's!!"
5,the best out there,This product is the best I have found yet. It is so universal you can use it as breading for fish or chicken and make all kinds of breads with it. My kids like the pancakes this mix makes better than homemade.
5,The best gluten free flour I have found,"This is the only gluten free flour I have found that works just as well as regular flour. I have made pie crusts, cookies, zucchini bread, pancakes--you name it I use my original recipes and substitue the flour with this product. I only use 1/2 the amount of baking soda and powder because it already has some in it. We only have 1 of 3 children that needs gluten free and the others dont notice when I give them this."
5,Gluten and/or wheat sensitive? try Pamela's flours..,"My sister and I have been ordered off wheat products since we visited a nutritional doctor. That was two years ago. Pamela's flour products, including this one, has enabled us to eat breads and pancakes and cookies and cakes How could one live without them in the diet? The Bread flour is easily interchangeable with regular flour requirements in most recipes. The baking and pancake mix works best with the recipes which Pamela's website offers."
5,Absolutely fabulous!,"This mix is amazing! All of my friends who have tasted it, think it is just as tasty as any regular pancake. And the chocolate chip recipe on the bag is to die for. My friends love it and always request that I make them for events. You can use this mix just as you would use bisquick, it is very versatile. It is a must have staple for any gluten free kitchen."
3,LESS THAN $3 per pound for 12 lbs of rice flour baking mix,"The ingredients are mainly rice flour, buttermilk powder, baking powder and xantham gum so one could definitely mix their own but the price is decent compared to the price of just rice flour.I made the chocolate chip cookies and the cornbread from the recipes on the back of the pouch and both came out fine."
5,Great Size and Product,Great product...use it like Bisquick. I order an extra shipment for the Holidays for baking gluten free cakes and cookies.
1,Absolute trash trash trash ...,"I can't believe that Blue Moon even published this trash! I mean Ok so erotic books are geared to the 'eye of the beholder' and what may interset me might make another reader shudder.I have even given books I personally didn't like 5 stars since they may not have been my thing, but this book has no redeeming qualities!The book is made up of 10 seperate stories with the first 5 basically having ONE main theme spank, birch, whip.... no sex mind you just spank, birch whip ...The second series of 5 stories are broken up into even more one to two page stories and deal with somewhat the same thing but there, oh please save me from these kinds of books, at least was some sex ...Please Blue Moon lets have some level of editorial quality control! pullllleeeeezzeee"
3,Wears off fast,"We found that with this product you really need to add it everyday because it wears off quickly and does not hold the chlorine levels. Now if you are using a floating dispenser with tablets, this product is great for boosting the chlorine levels in those times when readings are just below the normal level and you have heavy use."
3,Worth $10 - Just $10,"For ten dollars, I got a lot of knife. However, there are many little negatives about this knife and they add up. If you grip the knife too firmly, the frame lock jams into place. This happens, because of the open design of the handle and because the back portion of the blade, where the frame lock rests, was not cut straight. The ""Gerber"" written on the front of the knife has dull lettering. The finish has many smudges and blemishes. The most annoying thing is that the knife came impossible to open with one hand and difficult to even open with two hands. I am still trying to loosen the pivot screws. I removed the belt clip and the screws left an adhesive like residue. Overall, the knife is acceptable, but not worth the trouble for more than $10. Also, the 440a steel does not help elevate the value of the blade. Gerber's site has a $31 price tag for this product and it seems way too high.***Update*** I returned it."
5,"Sharp, sturdy little knife","Of all the smaller sized knives Gerber puts out, this is my favorite. Really sharp out of the box, and has a strong, sturdy feel to it. A little heavy for the size, but that's a fair trade for its durability.Also, it's just a really neat looking knife. Nice on the eyes but still as functional as can be.Most importantly, you can open and close this knife easily with one hand. I'm left handed, and opening the blade backwards hasn't been a problem. Right handed it's a breeze.If you need a reliable edc on the smaller side, this is a good choice for the price."
4,Nice Little knife,"This is a great multi-purpose knife. It holds an edge well and in the two years I've had it, it shows no sign of rust. It sharpens easily to a razor sharp blade. The only negative for me is that the pivot is really tight and it doesn't open smoothly. Fr the price, you can't beat it though."
4,It's a Gerber,"Nice knife. Holds its edge. I don't like that the opening knob is wobbly, but it doesn't effect the functionality of the knife."
2,A marketing brochure disguised as a book,"I read a ton of books but have never been compelled to write a review - until now. While this book contained a couple of new sales ideas, most of it was about all the coaching clients they helped with details left out. Certainly Dr. Moine and his group are quite talented and have no doubt helped many sales professionals - but if you think you're going to find out anything more than general ideas/concepts in this book, you're dreaming. I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't have to buy it. FWIW, to date, the most comprehensive and detailed book on marketing details/techniques that I have seen is Hogan's Psychology of Persuasion."
5,SCHOOL IS NEVER OUT FOR THE PRO,"Dr Donald Moine introduced me to the concept of hot words fifteen years ago in his best seller, UNLIMITED SELLING POWER. I can speak from practical experience regarding Moine's insights when it comes to the power of persuasion. Now in his latest gift to the sale professional Donald will you guide to increased sales success through your own unique UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION. Through organized words Donald will give your presentation structure and power.If you are not improving your skills someone will take your business away from you. Study this word goldmine."
3,Get it from the library,"The authors spend so much time dropping the names of the people and companies they are consulting for, there is no time for any meat. More good examples of how to do some of the things they say millionaire sales people do would make this book much better. The book is mostly a marketing ad for their coaching services."
3,An good book,"This book contains a lot of good ideas but is extremely repetitive in portions. The authors take an idea and beat it to death. In between they give numerous examples of how they made their ""clients"" sucessful with each idea...in short every chapter contains a plug for their consulting practice. I guess this is the price you pay for the few ideas you get."
4,Insightful!,"Few salespeople can rely on pure instinct to sell successfully. Those few who become sales millionaires without working to improve their skills were probably sustained by a doting aunt in the first place. But, those who look on sales as a business that can be learned and must be practiced and refined are the ones who usually become sales millionaires. Donald Moine and Ken Lloyd preach what they practice. Both men have earned a significant living selling themselves and selling what they learned in the process. Although they have never sold a car or a bungalow, their analysis of the salesperson's dilemma is specific and accurate.

3,I liked it but. . .,"I think Alice Hoffman is a great writer and the story really draws you in, but, it seemed to start falling apart with the introduction of the Giant. It felt like he was there just to help the author move the plot along to its final conclusion and that diappointed me."
2,Not her best,"I love Alice Hoffman but this isn't her best work. Her writing style is as crisp as ever, and the plot has light touches of the magical realism she used more in later books. But I didn't connect particularly with most of the main characters. The elderly woman who is a catalyst for several of the key events in the story, and the ""giant"" introduced quite late in the book, are far more interesting and clearly-drawn than the couple whose marriage is supposedly the central plot."
3,typical Hoffman,"In all of Alice Hoffman's books there 3 characters. There is the bad boy, that women just seem to be mesmerized by, although ignorant and uncharming. There is the noble older wiser character, the Atacus Fitch of the novel. Lastly, there is the women of the novel, always attracted to the bad boy with little or no substance, usually wronged by him, and trying to right her life. This novel is no different. While these people occure in all Hoffman novels, I have to admit they do capture the reader. Maybe its the magic, her perfect description of the seasons, I don't know, but all her books keep me reading to the last page."
3,"Starts off good, then goes downhill","I am a fan of most Alice Hoffman novels, but I was not thrilled with Illumination Night. The beginning of the story is good, but the middle and ending go downhill when dealing with Eddie, the giant. I do not think that a giant should have been written into this story. If Eddie had been a regular guy with a dark side, the story would not have been as bad, but the fact that he was a giant made me feel critical toward the storyline. However, it was not a horribly written book, and it was fairly quick to get through. It intertwines the lives of a wild teenager named Jody, who is caring for her grandmother on Martha's Vineyard, the family next door, and Eddie. I read the 1987 hardcover version."
4,A good summer book.,"This is one of Alice Hoffman's earlier books. It's filled with the magic realism for which she is known. The characters are all well drawn, especially Vonny and Mrs. Renny. I couldn't understand the husband's actions, however, and just did not feel much sympathy for him. Anyway, I love anything written by Alice Hoffman and always find her characterizations so natural. The people and their actions usually ring pretty true. Ms. Hoffman paints beautifully with words, and this is a perfect book for summer.Kathleen"
2,Not Her Best,I normally love Alice Hoffman but I really didn't care for this book very much. The people didn't seem very realistic to me at all. Their responses to situations and interactions with one another weren't believable at all. There is a lot of talk of love but I don't feel any kind of love between any of the characters at all. As much as I was hoping to get to the end when it finally did arrive I was like what? It just ends. In what seems like the middle of the story. While I really like her other books I can't recommend this one.
3,"Not really ""illuminating""","I love Alice Hoffman's style of writing and her development of characters. Andre, Vonnie, Simon, Elizabeth, Eddy and Jody are all fascinating and I couldn't wait to read more about them. However, as the story went on and I was getting near the end, I realized that there was going to be no real conclusion, no tying up of loose ends, no satisfying ""aha!"" moments (except for Elizabeth)...and I assume that is Ms Hoffman's intention, but I was left with a very dissatisfied feeling. I'm sure there are all kinds of deep meanings to be deduced from the story (or perhaps not!). When I read a novel for relaxation I prefer a beginning, a middle and an end, and this book left too many ends hanging loose for my taste."
2,Does not fit a 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix,"I really like the Gatorback product, but the 4060660 model does not fit a 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix with the 3.8 liter engine and supercharger. It needs another 10 mm or so, which is why I bought the Dayco 5060665. Lesser quality, but it fits."
2,"Good Alarm Clock, Bad Audio","The radio/alarm works well as an alarm clock. The beeper mode wakes you up well, and I especially appreciate the remote for snooze in the morning. However, the radio sounds like a 60's era transistor radio. You can't hook up an antenna to improve FM reception."
1,Pass on this one,"A very disappointing book. My first clue was the caption on the second page for ""Chishungura"". The correct name is ""Chushingura"". Similar errors riddle the book (""Ikaurga"", ""Shikiby""). There are numerous illustrations, but many are poorly focused or obviously digitized at a low resolution. This one is not worth spending your money on."
3,Interesting book,"This is an interesting book about how the KA-BAR: Next Gen came about. I would have liked some real life stories from the Marines, Navy, etc. used the original during WWII or other conflicts. There is a letter from KABAR with the testing statics on the new knife that didn't mean anything to me. Overall, an easy, quick read about knife development.Three stars because it could have had more about the original Ka-bar."
3,Kabar The next Generation,Overall a pretty good modern view of the Kabar fighting knife. I was hoping for some post history on the Type 2 Kabar for collecting.
5,A fine addition to any science library,"An excellent low-math book that covers many everyday concepts in physics, allows anyone to think through everyday problems and gain experience in thinking without doing calculations or sitting through endless ball-rolling-down-ramp labs. It shows ways that physicists and scientifically literate people think about physics problems in general terms. I've seen it on many shelves- grad students, postdocs and professors, teaching or not, since my undergrad days 25 years ago , alongside Art of Electronics, Jackson, Halliday/Resnik , and a book of integrals. Fine for junior- and high school students, and even younger with parental guidance. Many kids have sensible questions about why e.g. a bike stays up or who you really wouldn't want to run into on a football field, and the answers to them, and nice sketches too."
5,A must for every teacher,"Simple, but non trivial, conceptual problems with clear, insightful, elegant solutions without math. For everyday use to challenge students' minds."
1,"Well, the bags are adaquate, but the frame....","I have to say that I was so excited when I bought this strainer. It looked so simple, and so functional, and best of all, so affordable! Then I attempted using it...The bag falls off the frame if you fill the bag more than about a third full, no matter how tightly you tie the strings. The reason for this is that it can't slip under the metal loop completely to grasp better because the legs of the thing come directly out of the hoop, and for intensive purposes, from the edge. There is nothing for the bag to grasp. I do larger batches of jellies, and having to slow down production this much is unacceptable.The upshot is that the bags work. If you've already bought this, and have access to some gallon-sized glass jars (ours were originally pickle jars), you can use those and put the bag in them. It works PERFECTLY. Almost as if that was the original idea..."
3,works but unsteady,"This product strains the juice from the fruit well, but it is awfully precarious on its long skinny tripod legs. It can easily tip over."
3,GPX/Yorx Karaoke Machine,"This is a decent karaoke machine, although the supplied microphone is not omni-directional, and the VHS tape has poor quality. There seems to be a slight problem with feedback, since the microphone's short cord does not allow one to move far from the unit. My only suggestion for improvement other than the faults I mentioned above would be for GPX/Yorx to enter the Internet age by supplying an email address for customers to contact them, or at least a toll free number so that reporting packaging flaws over the phone did not result in phone bills equal to the item's purchase price."
1,Piece of CRAP!,This product is quite possibly the worst performing electronic device I have ever seen. The graphics / song lyrices did not work nor did the CD player or even the microphone. Junk JUNK JUNK!!!!
4,Read this man's work,"After enjoying the novel Small Town Punk, I'm working through all of Sheppard's books. I finished Bad Men Driving, a book of short fiction, which I found to repeat many themes and even actual tales from his novel. Moving on to Carl versus the Men from Mars, I found the work fresh and quite enjoyable. The stories follow Carl through various points in his life: Carl the child, Carl in high school, Carl the line cook, and Carl in the military. The stories pull from Sheppard's themes of the nervous loner battling through the world using cynical humor and mental toughness. Situations are much different than Sheppard's other work and this well written collection will keep your attention. You will be disappointed when each story ends, because you will want them to continue, discover what happens next, and dive further into the character's inner most make-up."
5,Extremely Detailed Historical Account of Kosovo,"Like most Americans, i did not know much about the history of Kosovo and the surrounding areas. When the mass genocide of Albanians took place in the 1990's, i too became interested in learning the history behind the ethnic strife in this region of the world. One reviewer mentioned that Mr. Malcolm cashed in on the strife to sell his book. This may be true, but Mr. Malcolm posseses a deep understanding of the Balkans so as not to undermine the validity of the book or his authority in writing it. The book was well written and well researched. Only a person with a great deal of prior knowledge on this subject could undertake this project to educate readers on a subject matter that has been virtually ignored in the context of world history. i highly recommend this book. i particularly enjoyed Malcolm's profile of Tito's regime."
4,Crash go the myths,"Read the attacks on this book below, then read the book and decide for yourself. Malcolm punctures both Serb and Albanian myths about this region's past by simply going back to the original sources (Serb, Albanian, Turkish, Austrian, and Italian). My one complaint is that he bends so far backward to be objective that at times the narrative bogs down in dueling accounts. If the Serb apologists can't accept a work this even-handed and scrupulously documented, they won't accept anything."
1,"This hysterical ""history"" is obviously biased","One simply has to note that the author's main sources were: 1. British consul memos and memoirs, 2. Tracts written by Vatican emissaries and only to be found in the Vatican depository, 3. Albanian political tracts.Furthermore the author's ideas on linguistics are just plain wrong while being almost totally irrelevant.This fellow is poorly educated. My guess is that he is very young."
1,"Ja,Ja,D Bezt Zhouting Militantz Zloganz Tekztbook!","This is essentialy a book with limited scope,goals and methodics.Icould hardly imagine any reason to call it anything but an example of ""what are we doing there"" manual-book,a definition consistent with its perfidious sugestivness in agitating for theories that do no hold.If one was to read only this book on Kosovo,the only impression will be that Serbs are babeling with their claims on Kosovo.I do not doubt that if NATO was to occupy the whole Serbia,something like ""There are Serbs,there ain't no Serbia"" thesis is to be launched,and somebody is going to illustrate it with false aura of serious history work. END"
2,Too early to write the story of Kosovo.,"Unfortunately the last paragraph of the book seems to confirm that it is not possibility of writing an unbiased account of history.""When ordinary serbs learn to think more rationally and humanely about Kosovo, and more critically about some of their nationallt myths, all people of Kosovo and serbia will benefit- not least the serbs themselves"".In spite of this the book is surely interesting and informative."
1,This is a completely pro-Albanian book,"Nobody ever wants to talk about the Serbs' point of view. If you watch a movie by a Hungarian film-maker name ""Children of Kosovo: 2000"" you get a real sense of what happened in Kosovo. This movie gives the view of both Albanian and Serbian children that live in the city of Kosovska Mitrovica."
2,Well written but definitely biassed,"This is a well-written and thorough account of the Albanian case for the posession of Kosovo. It makes practically no use of Serb sources except to reference claims which are to be rejected. The massive immigration to Kosovo from Northern Albania since WW2 is glossed over.The simple fact remains that the country is covered with Serb historic monuments and there are practically no Albanian ones. So we are expected to believe that the Serbs built monastries in someone else's country, whilst the Albanians lived there since the beginning of time without building anything!"
5,Impressive work,"Extremely good knowledge of history of the Balkans, Noel does it by masterly knitting pieces of history together. I enjoyed reading it, due to the fact that many of things written inthe book are also told by my grand father. I prefer the book to all of those interested in knowing the roots of conflicts in the Balkans.Andrei StefanovskiSofia, Bulgaria"
5,Great Book,"Enjoyed it very much. Malcolms narrative is superb, and his investigations into so-called truths or myths are brilliant.Definitely a must-read."
1,Good and Bad,A well researched book yet Noel Malcolm's preface is enough to show me that he is not an un-biased historian. His facts about Rambouillet and Racak are totally false yet he still tows the Nato line of Serb bad-Alabanian good.
1,What was he thinking?,I read this book about a month ago when I had to do a report for world cultures. I was supposed to deliver a research paper. I was trying to objectively write this paper on the serbs and the albanians and the balkan wars. All I found out was that the author did little or no research before he wrote this book. The albanians are not without blame and the serbs are not comepletely guilty. I wish that the author had shown it how it was.
5,5 STARS FOR CENSORSHIP,THANKS FOR NOT ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO BE EXPOSED TO A READER'S OPINION. WHY DIDN'T YOU INCLUDE MY COMMENTS WITH THE OTHER CUSTOMER COMMENTS? WHAT IS YOUR INCOMPETANT MR. MALCOLM'S PROBLEM? IS HE AFRAID OF NEGATIVE CRITICISM?
4,Balanced Picture of Kosovo,"As a student of history, I have found most of the recent works on Kosovo to be far too one-sided (almost ALL demonize the Serbs and glorify the Albanians). This work attempts to walk the middle ground and, does so very well. Making few judgement calls, the reader is left to make their own decisions on right and wrong, good and bad. While I abhor the recent actions of some Serbians, I equally abhor the actions being taken by the Kosovar Albanians. A reading of this book puts into perspective however what is now occuring and, gives a glimpse of what to expect in the future. I only wish our government officials had been required to read this book before putting one foot into that icky mess we have now labeled KFOR. At least they would have had a better idea of what to expect once the NATO bombing had stopped."
2,Informative but biased,"This is the most informative of all books written on the history of Kosovo and very useful in light of recent/ongoing events. Unfortunately the information presented is strongly biased in favor of the Albanian version of the (until recently)ethnically mixed history of Kosovo.My advice: read this book, but keep an open mind"
3,"Twisted , but interesting history","Noel Malcolm tries to cover the history of Kosovo in a relatively small book. To a large extent he succeeds in this task for at least the casual reader. Some of the history is quite fascinating and Malcolm is a good storyteller. There is evidence of considerable research and deep knowledge of the area. If it weren't for his irritating tendency to either destroy Serbian historical ""myths"" or to at least create doubt about their veracity, this would be a classic book that I could recommend to everybody. Unfortunately, like so many revisionist historians, Malcolm has a big axe to grind. He seems to think that peace in Kosovo can be achieved by ""telling the truth"". However, like the hammer that sees nothing but nails, Malcolm sees Serbian historical mythology and bad politicians standing in the way of lasting peace. I would have preferred more scholarly detachment on a subject of such importance to the great powers of today."
1,mediocre at best,"I hoped this book would provide a good introduction to Kosovo. The author seemed more interested in destroying Serb ""myths"" than with telling what DID happen. His narrative also leaves something to be desired."
5,Eloquently states the facts of Kosovo,"Finally a book that has no bias. Noel Malcom eloquently states both sides (Albanian and Serb), then does an excellent analysis of the two. Clearly the best book ever to be written on Kosovo without no bias. *****(5 stars is an understatement)"
1,Bias book about serbian history - from pro albanian independence lobbyist,"Apparently Mr. Malcome did a good job as lobbyist and a rather poor job as historian; i would recommend everyone who read that book or who intends to read it to visit www.kosovo.com; several Serbian academics analysed his remarks about the history of Kosovo presented in his book; their analysis is scientific, precise and revealing; in any case, it shows that Mr. Malcome should stick rather to popular literature than to History; check simply (...)"
2,"Intellectual, but lacking","After reading his earlier book, ""Bosnia: A Short History"", which was excellent, I did have high expectations for this book. What I was left with was a feeling that this was rushed out to make a profit from the war.I found a very intellectual book, very focused on the linguistic parts of the culture.Short of one or two chapters, which are excellent, this book will not assist most people in understanding the area better, nor the culture. If you are going to the area, I cannot recommend this book as a good resource. If you are a student of languages, you will love it."
1,Not very pleased,"I actually bought this in a store and tried it on and liked it okay then. However, when I began wearing it in my daily routine, it begin to shift. I have very small cup size, 36A, and I really dislike how it moves around on me all of the time. Also, after putting it through the washer and dryer it now makes some annoying noises when I move in it. The fabric feels worse than it did before I washed it and is now uncomfortable on my skin. To me, it feels as though the materials of this bra are not quality and therefore are the reason for its very short life in my wardrobe. Underneath the bra size on the back strap it says in large letters ""Made in China"". I would definitely not buy this again."
5,PLEASANTLY SURPRISED,"This set will comfortably sit side-by-side with links sold at high-end retailers (that sell for - seriously - 20 times more).Product exactly as pictured/represented. Ditto for the presentation box (were you planning a gift; Yeah, I'll take a pair :)"
1,"Sorry, Amount of product vs. calories/etc. ridiculous.","American Diabetes Society should be ashamed, with their endorsement of Glucerna cereal. It states on the box, ""For People With Diabetes.""3/4 of a cup is the defining amount for your breakfast:This will fill you for about an hour. If you need to re-fuel, here is what it will cost you in sugar:For 3/4 of a cup, 6 grams of sugar; if you need more cereal, double or triple the sugar.For 3/4 cups, carbohydrates24 grams; if you need more cereal, double or triple the amount of carbs."
1,Bad mastering,Only the second disc out of almost a thousand I own that is inaudible due to low-level mastering. Had to boost Tasso movement 10dB to hear it. Buy another version of this!
5,A GREAT UNDERAPPRECIATED BOOK,"It has been many years since I read this book. I don't think it sold very well when it was new but let me assure you this is a great read. It is an epic story set in the present and during slavery, in the USA and Europe. And epic story I could not put down.I had the honor of meeting the author on afternoon in the Kroch's and Brentano's bookstore in Chicago. I told him how much I enjoyed this book. He looked somewhat surprised and smiled and just said: ""Oh that book."" I think he may have been disappointed in the reception of the public to this book. No matter take a chance and get a copy I believe you will enjoy it."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad read. It does lose you from time to time but if you stick to it, it'll be fine. I much prefer his Cyborg 009 manga over this though."
4,A voice of limitless range and rare fury,"This tenor has a voice that can literally blow most fellow tenors off the stage. Though the diction could be improved, and the piano voice could be more melodic, the baritone level is wonderfully powerful, the ringing highs effortless. And the occasional 1/3 or 2/3 surpassing of the high notes - remarkable."
2,"By ""Economy"" I think they REALLY meant ""Cheap""","This was advertised as an ""Economy Ring Buoy"". But I think they must have really meant to say, ""Cheap Ring Buoy"".It arrived and looks very pretty, just like in the photo. BUT, it is super cheap and not at all worth the price. All quality lifesaver rings are heavier so you can throw them to a drowning person in an emergency. And they are usually coated with some sort of rubber or plastic boating.This ring is only light-weight un-coated styrofoam and already has some dents in it. And it is super light so you can't throw it any distance.For twice the price of this one, you can get a ring that is 10 times better and will actually save a life."
4,Nice for decoration - very light,"I purchased this primarily as a decoration for our pontoon. It matches the aqua decking! If you are looking for a life saving device, as others have said, it is very light and would be difficult to throw accurately. It is a hard Styrofoam and comes as pictured with the rope and straps. This was light enough for me to Velcro to the side of the guard rails."
4,Buoy what a good ring,"The economy ring buoy ring I purchased is an excellent buy. The price is right; it is functional, and it looks good."
5,I knew I wanted more of these pens,"Had a couple of these pens before ordering and wanted to have a small supply on hand. If you never have used these, then I suggest you order a box and you will be hooked!"
4,A fun writing experience,These are the smoothest-writing pens I've found. They really make writing fun. The only problem is that they don't seem to last as long as some other pens.
1,Don't Buy this...,"I bought this product because it got decent reviews online, however I can only give it one star because it never worked...how can I review the use of something that so clearly doesn't function. I'm extremely unhappy about the money I wasted on purchasing and shipping this item, and I would NOT recommend it to anyone."
4,Pedometer,"Good product. No fancy bells or whistles, but a solid pedometer that is durable and easy to use."
3,Worked Well but Came Off Belt,"I lost it on the fourth day. It has a tendency to come off the belt when you sit or bend over. I wanted to wear it all day long, but maybe you should only wear it on walks. Hey, it was great while it lasted, though."
2,Condensation build-up,"I LOVED this until the 4th day using it, it was really hot outside and i went on a long run. Ever since then there has been on-and-off condensation that builds up inside the screen...."
2,Great while it works...,"Like the other reviews, mine has just stopped working. The clock is fine as is the battery. It just won't count steps. Mine worked for maybe 3 months. I loved the 7 day counter...but I'm back to my old cheap Sportline."
3,Falls off easily if you wear it with jeans,"I have had this pedometer for three weeks and enjoy the fact it is easy to use and read and that it records the past 7 days of walking. However, my big complaint is that it falls off. When I wear it with thinner pants, like yoga pants, it is fine, however, when I clip it on pants with thicker fabric at the waist, it pops off. This has happened about 5 times, all while wearing jeans. If you plan to wear this regularly with jeans, you may want to look for a different model."
5,KEEPING TRACK,This is a great pedometer if you just want to keep track of the steps you take each day. You don't have to worry about calories or anything else.
5,"easy, easy, easy","My mother who is 81 years old and not to up on gadgets loves this and wears it every day, she tries to walk a little further every day. It is so easy for her to use without calling me to fix it all the time. I have one also and wouldn't leave home with out it."
4,Pedometer,"This is my first purchase of a pedometer. I do like how it tracks 7 days of steps taken. It does, however, add extra ""steps"" when driving in a car and thus it is not as accurate as it could be. Overall, however, I am very satisfied with this pedometer."
1,Not well made.,I bought this thing. I broke into many pieces within a week. All the screws fell out and the clip broke off. It was a waste of money.
4,it works,i was disapointed i wasnt walking 10K steps a day already but only 4K ...the machine seems to work fine...
1,fast service,I can't find this pedometer in stores in my area and was glad to find it from Amazon. It's very simple to set up and accurate. It came fully functioning in just a few days. I lost my first one and will order another from here if I loose it again!
4,Pedometer,"Works . Fairly accurate. I got it for my wife, but she forgets to wear it. If mine breaks I'll use this one. I like the time feature and the 7 day look back."
5,Awesome and reliable,"I am an elementary PE teacher and have started using pedometers in my class. I have tried others, but these are by far the best and most reliable for kids. It is great becauce they turn off and save batteries and then at the end of PE kids press the top button and there fianl step count appears!!! Awesome pedometers.Patrick"
1,Disappointed,"My pedometer worked fine for two weeks, and then stopped. The clock works, I've reset it, but for two days it did not reliably register steps. Now it doesn't register at all.Omron will ""fix"" it for me, but the cost of shipping it to them and the return (they make you pay for it) is the same as the cost of a new unit.Reading the reviews it seems some people love their units, but that this failure isn't unique."
2,stopped registering steps in less than 30 days,"I can see the other 7 reviewers are delighted with their unit but my HJ-150 was purchased Sept 14th, stopped working October 12th. The battery is OK because the clock function works, and I can reset the whole unit, it just doesn't register any steps anymore.For a $12.50 purchase, I'll drop them an email and see if they will replace the unit but I am not going to spend much time on the process. Hopefully Omrom will do the right thing and replace it."
4,"smart,no nonsense product","Calorie counter ? No need.Miles/Kilometers converter ? No need.You want your 10,000 steps per day ? This one will help you achieve the goal. Big numbers, good sensitivity, unobtrusive, it works, it works well , it is here to stay.I like the midnight reset function, very useful. And the memory of the previous days is a great motivator.This is my third unit. I lost the first...it does slip off your belt from time to time. I gave the second to someone I liked. It makes for a great present too.Only problem : triggers the detectors in airports and makes those guys very suspiscious."
5,This is a great pedometer,"This pedometer is very convenient and comfortable to take it everywhere with you. It's quite small and easy to work with. I have used it for couple months...so far so good.It makes you realized how much you walk a day. If you are conscious about being healthy, this pedometer is a nice tool to have.Pro : small cheap and simpleCons : it can slip off your belt"
1,Fine until is stopped working,"Worked fine for about a year..then deadsville. Consider before buying. New batteries don't help: it lights up for a few minutes, then dead."
2,Poorly made clasp,I never got a chance to see how this would work because the first day it fell off and was run over by a car. It looked to be a decent product but the clasp was so cheap it fell right off while doing a slow jog.
5,Pedometer,"I think this is the best on the market because it is fairly accurate, easy to use, doesn't break if dropped. Worth the money!"
1,Nearly worthless,Wildly inaccurate and of questionable consistency. First test registered 20 paces as 33. Next test registered 30 paces as 52. There was no third test.
2,So far not too accurate,"I just received my Omron HJ-150 hip pedometer. Was very easy to set time and clip on the waist. I have been testing for accuracy this first day of wearing it. It has not counted correctly yet. I clipped this in 2 different places at my waist and still is not counting correctly. I see a picture showing the pedometer clipped to a pocket and if it has to be on a pocket, I will have to send this back as I wear dresses/skirts daily with no front pockets like jeans would have. At this time I am not certain that is the problem, but I'm leaning towards that. I will test this all week and update my review if I find the problem or if it starts counting correctly."
1,Didn't record steps,"Thought this would be very easy to use with limited functions, but set the date and clipped it on and it did not record any steps. Disapointing as it was a Christmas gift"
5,great purchase!,"Items were just as stated, quick turn around time, great price....will definitely buy from seller again!"
4,Worked great for my Dell Inspiron 531,Crucial sent this to me 2nd day even though I ordered with free super saver option. My wife loves the performance of the desktop with the additional 1GB memory.
5,Very reliable desktop memory!,Purchased 2 x 1GB memory modules for my Dell Vostro desktop to maximize memory to total of 4GB. I used the Crucial website to find out which memory works with my system. System seems to run faster especially when using large files. Lifetime warranty makes this a no-brainer for upgrading desktop computers. Highly recommended!
5,Crucial memory,nothing wrong with the memory but it did not work in my Dell computer. Dell requires a different type of memory.
2,Memory...,After struggling to install this memory with big hands in a tight space(under the disc drives on an HP computer). It finally recognized the memory. There really wasn't much of an increase in speed or performance that could be recognized with a WOW but more like an OK. I guess I could have saved some money and been satisfied with OK.
1,"Was recomended, but didn't work",I used Crucial site to find RAM model for my Gateway SX2800-01. When memory came it didn't work. I called Crucial and they informed me that I should try different one. I had to return the product and I ordered Samsung RAM - the same memory brand as I already have in my computer. Big disappointment and 3 lost weeks.
3,Functional,"I purchased this memory for a Dell Vostro 200, intending to increase the RAM from 2 GB to 4 GB. Unfortunately it does not work in combination with the existing memory. No combination of new and old memory would work. I tried both dual and single channel modes. By itself, the new memory works perfectly but in any combination with the existing RAM, the machine will not boot.I regret that I must return this purchase. The product is otherwise good and delivery was quick. 5 stars on functionality and delivery, 0 stars on compatibility.This memory is 240-pin DIMM DDR2 PC2-5300 • CL=5 • Unbuffered • NON-ECC • DDR2-667 • 1.8V • 128Meg x 64 •The Dell Vostro 200 takes 240-pin DIMM DDR2 PC2-5300 • CL=5 • Unbuffered • NON-ECC • DDR2-667 • 1.8V • 128Meg x 64 •I expected it to work."
4,Performs as Expected,The memory has performed as expected after installation. Crucial's website was very useful for determining compatibility.
4,excellently working fine.,without any problem it's working fine with my dell xps 410. Installtion of a 1 GB extra RAM with my existing 1GB I got some more speed smoothnes and ease of use.
1,Not the laptop chip,"I ordered this because I was trying to get a laptop chip. I know that I should have double and triple checked it before ordering it, but honestly, it's such a long name. Why can't they specify it more. This is not a laptop chip! :/"
5,RAM,"Service was exceptional ! Product was received way ahead of expected date, installation was a breeze and the product performed as expected. Highly recommend for those needing increased capacity."
1,Strange shipment...,"I was worried about this memory as soon as I opened the package, for one of the two DIMMS was beat up like it had been used before. It also had an old paper price tag stuck to it reading ""$40"". The two DIMMS shared specs and were labeled as such, but were made in two different factories: one in Malaysia, one in Singapore. Despite being the right specification, as per both HP and Crucial, the pair of DIMMS I got didn't work in my computer. I returned them."
