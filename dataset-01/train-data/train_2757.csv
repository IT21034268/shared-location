5,Spectacular,"This one of the most impressive games for Playstation on the market.The graghics are absolutly incredible.The music is irritating at first,but grows on the gamer surprizingly fast.The gameplay is somewhat repetitive(mainly in cambat mode)but is still highly enjoyable.With its 4 discs,it should keep even a fast gamer busy for quite awhile."
3,Great game but bad product,"Though I admit this game title is old, that does not mean the product should be damaged. 1 of the discs were probably damaged in storage and the game system is having trouble reading the disc. This was my second attempt at getting the game; the first time all the discs were broken so I returned them. But this time only 1 was broken and I found that out too late. Final Fantasy VIII is a great game but if only the discs were not broken."
5,WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW,"I loved this game!!! What can I say? Honestly, it was a depature from former FF games. The draw system, the battles and the junctioning system. However, once you take the time to learn FF8 its well worth it. The graphics are FANTASTIC, the story line is rich and complex. I would recommned getting the strategy guide along with this game, otherwise you might be slightly comfused as to what you will be doing next."
2,A big disapointment,"I waited very long for this game. I got very mad with the long fighting and an extreme amount of random fights. The game was to long. I got to the fourth CD and just stopped playing because it got really boring. Squaresoft has made better games that people should try. I would recomend FF7 (which was 100 times better than FF8), Fianl Fantasy Anthology, Fencer Musashi, and Wild Arms(not by Square soft but very good.) It had bad characters(Cloud was much better than Squall)and a terrible storyline. The game had its high points though. The graphics were good and the GF system was mediocre."
2,Waste of Time and Money,"I was sorely disappointed with this game. While Squaresoft had good intentions with it, they failed. The game is all eye candy, with limited plot, and character (in my option) development. The plot (if you can call it that) seems to one that was picked out of a hat.Don't waste time, or the money. FFVII is better. The over all plot and character development is far better then this game.In closing, even if you decide not to take my advice, at least rent it a few times."
3,"Ok, i guess","After beating 7 i got 8 the next day. The graphichs were the best yet, and i couldn't stop playing it. There were a couple things i noticed though. There was never a boss which made you take more then a second try on him unlike ff7 which had guys like demons gate (took me 27 trys) and the first encounter with ultimate weapon. The main reason is g forces are too powerful early game and at disk three squalls lion hart limit break easily defeats any guy. The next thing was the story line got weaker after a while and the fights got easyer. ff7's story line was much better then 8's. another thing is 8 had less playing time then 7. Finally it had little apeal when i could be playing other games like unreal tournament and star craft. Overall i think if u dont have 7 youll apreciate it alot, but 7 being as addecting as it was beats 8 in everything execpt graphics."
2,the horrible truth,the first 2 discs are OK. the whole junctioning thing is a pain you can only have 5 battle choice not like in FF7 (the best 1) where you can have as many commands as you wish and battling for GF's is beyond stupid i beat this game 4 times got evey weapon item and GF what a waste of time
1,A Disgrace to Playstation RPGs,"I was so horribly dissapointed with this game. I was expected something to the quality of Final Fantasy Tactics, Xenogears, or Lunar: SSSC, but what I got was an obviously rushed product. The characters are bland and underdeveloped, the music doesn't fit at all (the orchestral soundtrack is excellent however), the story is simply a series of events that builds into nothing, and the gameplay is dull and simply features an excercise in micro-management. Come on Squaresoft! Buy at your own risk."
1,A complete let down after FFVII,"I was really excited about getting FF8 because I had just finished FF7. I oohed and aahed at the fancy opening and played it for a while. A little while into it I asked myself ""What the heck is this? "" There was no plot! It was all fancy graphics and cool attacks! All the characters were flat and boring and the game itself was just not interesting! I was really expecting a lot from FF8- I wanted it to be twice as good as FF7 and I was totally disappointed! I kept playing it anyway just in case it actually got good and it only got worse! Square should be ashamed of themselves!"
1,READ READ READ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are reading this, then i can help you from spending money. I have been a diehard ff fan from ff to ff8, well of course, THe graphics are.........ok.........but this is just my opinion. I think that the ff7 graphics are better, and the sound and storyline and characters are too! [...]!!!!!!! Oh by the way, i think that the jenova music is cool. [...]."
3,First FF game I didn't feel like finishing,"There's a lot to like about Final Fantasy VIII coming out of the experience of FF7, but there's also some things not to like. I admired the more realistic and correctly-proportioned characters in the game, but disliked the final battles and the preparations needed to have some chance at the final conflict.All RPGs tend to have super bosses and lengthy final battles, but the story itself wasn't compelling enough to make me really want to care, or really curious, to bring the game to its conclusion. FF9 and FFX both have been a lot more compelling in this respect."
5,great game,love this gameclassical rpg at bestrecomendedas difficult as ff7 and deeper than ff9 or 10
5,a great game to play if u like final fantasy,i have beaten ff7 and 8 and 9 this one would have to be like second best final fantasy this game has great graphics a lot gameplay and very good music it can have over 72 hours of gameplay if u try to do all the sidequests and master the game but if your not going to master it it will take about 50 to 70 hours of gameplay my time was 57:06 before i fought the last boss well this is all for my review
5,great,This game has a great story line and very good details. It is very challenging and is fun to play. a great gift
2,Could have been the Final....period.,"If not for Final Fantasy IX switching gears, the franchise may have died from this title. FFVII was a pure marvel and still is, but VIII lacked any good storyline and the characters weren't the least bit interesting. It's a solid piece if you want to have the entire series, let's say, pull it out once in a while to hack at it. It's hard to stay interested most of the time, although it does have some cool CG cut-scenes to do it justice, mostly, it's dull repetition and sits as a rushed follow up to FFVII and it shows. Fans, thank God for IX saving the day, X bringing in the next-generation, and XI, XII coming up. So long from the dullsville FFVIII calls Balaamb. I hope the cadets have retired..."
3,Its alright,"Ok, this game is good. It has great storyline, great characters and GREAT graphics. I'm a Final Fantasy fan from way back, so in comparison, my opinion changes. We'll start with FF7. Better storyline, I became more attached to the characters, and the magic system was better. FF3, OH MY GOD! If you don't have SNES, buy one so that you can get this game. FF3 is the best of the series. The characters are the best ever made, and the esper system is the best way to do magic. On major flaw of FF8, in my opinion, is the armor. What armor? Thats my point, there is no armor. You equip magic to you to make the stats go up, then if you use the magic, your stats go down. Thats Whak! I guess, if you already have FF7 and the anthology, get this, because it is entertaining. Its just not as good as it was made out to be."
3,"A good game, but it cant match it's predessesor","Final Fantasy 8 is by no means a bad game, but i simply wasn't as drawn in or as interested with it as i was with Final Fantasy 7. perhaps it was just because FF7 had a dark, forbidding atmosphere and FF8 was brighter, taking something out of the urgency of most situations. Anyway, if you own a PSX, and are interested in buying a final fantasy game, you should get FF7. if you allready have FF7, by all means get FF8 because it is fun. but i cant garauntee that you will enjoy it more than 7 because i didn't."
3,Just another average RPG,"First off, you play the role of a student. What sort of twisted fantasy is that? Then you become a mercenary and fight for cash. Gee, how engaging. The music is rehashed from ff7, the graphics are torn from it, so why couldn't they keep the great gameplay? I'd have to say that this game was the biggest disappointment I've ever had."
3,Not Final Fantasy,In all of the previous Final Fantasies there have been several differences such as espers to materia. But FFVIII has gone to far from the Final Fantasy Legacy. And the game is great except for one thing you have to continually use your GF's to battle normal enemies what's the fun in that. You Might as well not try and improve your weapon at all it's pointless. Bottomline is the graphics are great and the story is good but the three key elements of an RPG is 1. storyline 2.Variety in battle sequences 3. And a way to improve your character. Face it play control can be gotten used to and to true rpger's graphics don't mean jack so rent the game cus you'll regret buying it.
2,A major disappointment,"Final Fantasy 8 was a big disappointment for me. It clearly is one of the most impressive looking game out there. But, when it came down the content, it did not deliver. The story moved too slowly and did not draw me in. Story can take time to develop and still keep the player entertained. Final Fantasy 8 didn't do that at all. The battle system was also a problem. Due to the heavy emphasis on use of Guardian Force (Summoning from Final Fantasy 7) the battles took much longer than necessary. It got to a point where I was switching over to watch TV during Guardian Force sequences, because I grew tired of them. This is quite sad, because Final Fantasy 8 really is a great looking game. But the fact is, I had more fun playing another recent RPG, Suikoden 2, despite its simpler graphics and game engine. RPG is obviously not all about cool graphics."
2,what happened,"I think Squaresoft made this storyline overnite.I played this game for about 12 hours before going back to FF7.The worst storyline I have ever seen,no real twists in the game,and what is with that weird junctioning system.I was on disk 2 before I figured out how to junction properly.Buy Final Fantasy 7 its cheaper and better(by my opinion)."
2,"Over-hyped, Over-rated","This game has to be one of the most dissapointing ones ever. I waited a long time for FF8, and I have suffered a huge letdown. I'm assuming most people who gave this game a 5 have never played any real RPG's, or they would realize just how sorry this attempt is. The story is sleep-inducing, the graphics--while good for PSX--pale in comparison to anything you will see on Dreamcast, except for the FMV. The characters are card-board cutouts with no personality, and the battle system is almost as boring as the story. For REAL RPG fans who want a good game to play, I recommend Enix's Star Ocean 2 or Square's GOOD Playstation (their only good one as a matter of fact) rpg, Xenogears. Star Ocean 2 has a free roaming battle system, allowing you to move around at will and actually allow you to interact in your fights. Xenogears has a battle system similar to FF8, but the story, characters, and longevity (nearly 70 hours! ) make it so much better than FF*"
5,FF8 - Review,"The storyline is wonderful, but some of the characters are a tad annoying. The battle system is awesome imo, with stats based around junction to guardian forces(gf's) and Majic drawn from monsters or 'draw points' to be junctioned(bonded) to your stats. You are able to choose the abilities your gf's will learn based on the priorities you have set for yourself, wich makes gameplay easier based on ones own particular preference. Drawing gf's from some boss monsters allows you more alleyways for improvement. With an open and completely explorable world, as happens in most final fantasy games, And the storyline wich is set but still leaves room for an active immagination FF8 is definitely better than some people have given it credit for."
5,Wow...,"This is arguably the best Final Fantasy out there. Square decided to ditch super deformed characters, and instead created characters that looked extremely life-like (for the PS1). This helps the player to better related to the characters.The story is excellent, engaging, and very unpredictable (for the most part). The battle system is very fun and the summons are incredible.If you are a fan of RPGs or FF, then you should at least play this game if you don't buy."
4,Good RPG,"This game doesn't get enough credit from most FF fans. The cinematics are amazing as well as the audio, which are both big steps up from FF7 IMO. The plot is very complex and intricate, but it does take a while to get going. The draw system is kind of funky, but workable once you get used to it. The only thing that really bothers me after a while is being unable to skip the GF animations. They're very cool looking, but they get old after the first hundred times or so. Triple Triad is pretty darn cool and probably one of the best features of FF8.I really like FF6, and I'm definitely not a fan boy of 7, which is probably why I like 8. I don't love it to death or anything, but the limit breaks are fun, the FMVs are beautiful as I said before, and the plot offers a lot of intrigue if you have a little patience."
4,"Received in perfect condition, so-so gameplay",The item was in PERFECT condition.But I do not really enjoy the game compared to the other final fantasy games.I bought it because I like to collect them.
4,Final Fantasy VIII...Kind of Mixed,"The story in this isn't as good as some of the others but its pretty good. The graphics are awsome for playstation. But the game play wasn't as good as expected. The game was overated a bit. The junction system isn't as good, and taking magic from the enemy, come on. All and all it's a good game but you should buy FFVII or FF Anthology."
2,no... just no...,"this is the worst final fantasy game gameplay wise without a doubt. not only is the learning curve hours, but after that, you have to spend hours getting magic from the enemies to use and equip. This game graphic wise looks like it has been in work for a lifetime, and the FMV looks like PS2 or DC. the gameplay looks like it was made in a lifetime too, and that is a BAD thing."
3,Final Fantasy 8,"I loved Final Fantasy 7 which is and always will be a classic hit. It introduced me to the entire series. But with FF8, Square ditched some longstanding RPG traditions and put me off. I own the game but it just couldn't hold me long enough to play it through. The story progresses too slowly and doesn't stand up to previous efforts. The graphics and engine are absolutely amazing but the gameplay changed too much. No magic points, only spells you could draw from enemies for an almost unlimited supply of spells. No materia, half of the elements from past games were ditched. In short, change isn't always good. I would just as soon wait for Final Fantasy 9, which is returning to the games' roots as a medievil epic."
4,Fast!,Game arrived very quickly! Game works very well although small crack in the case not a big deal. very satisfied!!
2,Just like a use game,i got this game and didn't really play it my brother mostly did and he said is was an awesome game until you get to near the end of the second disc and it freezes at a bossthe only down fall is that you my regret buying the used oneits a good game if it worked properly
5,A RE-Review of one of the BEST Final Fantasy Games!,"Short And Simple.This Game IS WAY Bettr than FFIX. No Doubt. FFIX Was Dull and Lackluster compared to this game (Hey i still give IX 5 stars, for what it was as a game onto itself) but this game simply kicks ...! The Dance Scene on the first disc? is there anything more revealing and more deliciously beautiful on the PsOne? The Cut-Scenes are just this side of PS2 Glorious (Can anyone say Yuna Performing the Sending? I Knew You Could!) the Draw System Is Hella-Good! the Junction System is SO EASY and makes you a super player in no time. and the GF Summons? COME ON! Bahamut Alone is enough to make you cry, but Leviathan, Shiva, E-D-E-N????? All Miraculous! So all in all, don't believe the Bad Hype surrounding this Installment of FF. It's So Good, You'll Plotz!"
5,A Squaresoft Masterpiece,"Final Fantasy VIII,indeed!This game is brillant,not to mention absolutely AWESOME,it has action,comedy,romance,drama,and so much more!A must have game for all FF FANATICS!Play this one for yourselves,it's garuanteed to entertain,and keep you on the edge of your seat!The final word, FF8 rocks and rolls,TWO THUMBS UP!!Final Fantasy VIII most definetly RULES!"
3,Is this really by Square!,"Yes, I give it a satisfactory 3, but this was nothing compared to FF7, not even FF the original!Could Square realy be this bad? Yes, the graphics are the best ever, but that took away from the plot, which is suppose to be the forte of role playing games. The beginning and the end, I must admit, are great, but that's all that's carring it to 3 stars. If they only included the first CD and 4th CD, it would have been worth just as much as it is now.Shame on you Square and do better on FF 9 and 10!"
3,FINALFANTASY VIII,Ummmm where do I start yeah this game isn't that great how everyone loves ff7 and ff8 and you know what those two in my opinion there not that great there really boring so I mean if you like ff then try it out I bought it many years ago and I still havent finished it
1,Shutoff very hard to turn,"If you have not used this hose valve more than a week, the shutoff controls become very stiff and take a pair of pliers to twist to shut or open the hose connection. Further, these a valve are not make of red brass but some sort of alloy of zinc with a little copper mixed in. They tend to corrode with high mineral content water."
1,Not Recommended,"First off it's made in China. I wish distributors would identify these products. If I had known that ahead of time I never would have ordered it. But, since it arrived before I knew it I decided to install it anyway. While tightening the top one of the straps tore off.I should have known this as IT WAS MADE IN CHINA!!!! Cheap piece of crap. Returned."
5,"Please follow this book up with ""Deconstructing Jesus"" by Robert M. Price","This is one of many cheriched books that I proudly own, read and re-read. Religion, philosophy, theology and mythology all share a common ground. For a very well perspective on earlt ""Jesus movement's"", I HIGHLY recommend the book mentioned above by Dr. Robert M. Price."
2,Just my opinion,"Well, I must say, I was quite disappointed with this book. I was hoping to read what actualy happened and how Christian Myths were created, but instead the book talks about theories and examines them so deeply that it would totally lose me; it felt like a really boring text book that quotes other books and people in every line of the book. I am an avid hostory reader and in particular love European hiistory, but this book was really bad. Half way through the book, I stopped reading and picked up Brunelleschi's Dome by Ross King, whatta book. I also read his other book, Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling (see my reviews)."
4,Nice book,Worth the money many picturesI would recommend this bookIncludes many historical records could use more descriptions of artists style
1,Glencoe Pre-Algebra: An Integrated Transition to Algebra & G,Terrible book. doesnt explain very well. i had to have my dad help me learn it. ...
5,Simply the Best,"This concert is truly amazing. Idinas singing and storytelling are both theatrical and enchanting. Hers is the voice of the century and what every aspiring singer should strive for. Cannot recommend this highly enough. Idina we ""raise you high""."
2,A very bad copy of Barbra,I am deeply disappointed about this concert. The sound of the main micro isn't long enough clean and clear that should be. The voice of Idina is shrill and unpleasant. And even she try never can beat who mimics. Unnecessarily long and boring.
5,A lot of fun...,"...I saw this show when Idina stopped off at the Greek Theatre last fall (2011) for a great night. Can't wait to buy the CD and the DVD to be able to re-live it anytime. She was funny, smart, in great voice and a consummate performer! I'll see her anytime!"
5,Class Act,"Saw Idina Menzel in Buffalo NY with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra and it was a great night of music. Really like her mash up of Cole Porter's ""Love For Sale"" with Sting's ""Roxanne."" I wish Mr. Idina Menzel (aka Taye Diggs) showed up at this concert but he was not in attendance. She is down to earth with funny stories in between songs.Can't wait to see what she does next !!!"
3,HARD AS A ROCK,"VERY SOLID BENCH ITS JUST VERY HARD AND ITS NOT REALLY WIDE ENOUGH FOR A BIGGER PERSON, IT'S MORE FOR A WOMAN OR SMALL MAN,"
2,Haldeman is dismal,"I think both ""Forever Peace"" and ""Forever War"" are at best interesting but boring reads. Haldeman is a good character writer but a bad story teller - although there are interesting plot twists, you are never engaged. The ending to ""Forever Peace"" is straight from the script of a bad B movie. Overall, this book would be an absolute waste of time if it were any longer than 300 pages."
2,not a winner,"I've read about 100 pages and could not get into Forever Peace. I found that reading the reviews was more interesting than reading the book itself. One person said he tried to pick the book back up and start reading it again , but still couldn't get into it. So he put the book down...forever. I still get a laugh about that because I did the same thing. And what !? Hugo / Nebula winner!? That must have been a gift. There's no way this book deserved such high appraisal. It couldn't hold a candle to the Book Enders Game. I realized that this book was a waste of my spare time and that I could be doing something else , or reading something else. . There are other more interesting books out there to read than Forever Peace."
1,Awful.,"I guess I must be wildly out of tune with others who have reviewed this book. I found it to be unreadable, and I was unable to finish it. I tried three times, but no dice. I usually won't review books that I haven't finished, but I am making an exception here because this is the second Haldeman book in a row that was this bad. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours.Maybe the emperor has no clothes, or maybe I can't appreciate Haldeman these days. But I found this novel to be quite literally unreadable, and completely implausible and unconvincing."
2,Mediocre,"Worst then being plain bad, is being forgettably average. The plot line of Forever Peace was not strong to begin with, and the lack of flow only made it worse. Almost the entire first half seemed to be devoted to nothing, then suddenly things pick up, fast. So fast that reading the ending is like running into a brick wall."
2,No Good,"Essentially, this is a standard, politically correct tract that says the US, corporations, the military, and, apparently, most whites are ... and that if we all get together we'll teach the world to sing and live in perfect harmony. In other words, it's tripe. The premise is silly and the way they go about trying to implement the premise is jaw-droppingly stupid. Adding insult to the injury of a bad plot is the bad writing. The frequent switching from first person to third person is the big thing there that kept grabbing my attention. Every time it happened, I'd back up through the pages to see if there was some reason for it. There never was.Don't bother reading this book. It's not worth the effort."
2,meh,"There are times that sequels do not live up to the original, and are just used as a vehicle for the author to tell another story riding on the back of previous success. This is it.Adequeate as SciFi goes, but this and Forever War didn't need to be associated with Forever War.(copying review to Forever War as it applies there too)"
2,Thoughts on Forever Peace,"Forever Peace started strongly but, like Forever Free, had plotlines that didn't help the overall story and was quite ridiculous by the end."
2,No Character to Root For,"I really enjoyed Forever War, and the Accidental Time Machine, but I could not finish this book. The book is well written, but none of the characters interested me. The protagonist is depressed and suicidal, and the remaining characters are not sufficiently developed to spark much interest. And the plot, while interesting conceptually, drags. At some point you just don't care about how the story turns out, or about the people in it, and you put the book down and move on."
3,Solid but stolid.,"Haldeman's new book is not what I hoped it would be. The writing is solid and the ideas are unique BUT the characters are strangely flat. One can't help but compare it to ""The Forever War's"" William Mandella, whose free-wheeling narrative invited the reader to experience ever inner thought and emotion of his insane journey through time and space. None of the characters in ""Forever Peace"" are very likable. Maybe, that's the why the book is rather depressing and unfulfilling.Haldeman can't write a bad book, but ""Forever Peace"" is not one that I will be rereading."
2,blah!,"A Hugo that really disappoints me. Too much ""stream of consciousness,"" messy point-of-view (either you write in first person or you don't), bland plot, oh-so-intellectual and detached genius-like characters . . .. Could have been written fifty years ago, in the best pulp tradition. Please! SciFi can do better than that."
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"I've read almost everything Haldeman's written, and I found this book lacking. I'm no literary critic, so I'll just say that I lost interest (but finished it anyway).I do recommend 1968 (and also WAR YEAR, his first book about Vietnam). I also have greatly enjoyed his other science fiction books (MINDBRIDGE, ALL MY SINS REMEMBERED, and the WORLDS trilogy being my favorites).FP wasn't terrible. Just a bit dull."
3,"Not a Hugo Award caliber novel, but still a decent read.","I don't understand what was so great about this novel that it deserved the Hugo award. After having read Forever War, I was somewhat disappointed by this book. The character's are not very engaging and the antagonists are very one-dimensional and uninteresting. The resolution of ""humanizing"" the world through mind-to-mind interfacing was unsatisfying. This is not to say that the book wasn't entertaining. It just was less than what I had expected of a Hugo award winning novel by Joe Haldeman."
2,It could've been better,"I chose this book because it won a prize and its author is well recognized. There is not doubt that Mr Haldeman is a good writer and the topic is interesting. The use of drones for war is not a new concept and the author manages it well and gives a realistic description of how those new technologies would be used in war.Unfortunetely, the book gets boring, it includes a silly love story and it sometimes loses its focus. Too bad that this is the first book I read from Mr. Haldeman. Good he has better books, so I recommend you this book only if you are a fan."
4,"Good solid book, good solid plot, good solid characters","Not my favorite book. Not my least favorite by far. The technology was interesting and advanced the plot. I also enjoyed the switchings of perspective. I think most of those 'writing rules' were all good in the third grade, but by middle school I realized that most good writing really doesn't need to follow them. I like the book to speak for itself, not some antiquicated notion of what is 'proper.'"
1,"Boring, pale comparison to Haldeman's earlier work","I know this is no sequel to Haldeman's FOREVER WAR, it says so in the book.And it's not. Whereas FOREVER WAR was an imaginative metaphor for Vietnam, FOREVER PEACE is a dull read.Is there a trend toward domestic issues in sci-fi? It appears so. COSM, TERMINAL EXPERIMENT, and now this book, all devote large chunks to the character's ""issues,"" dysfunctions, and interpersonal problems.Hey, if I wanted that, I'd listen to some radio psychobabbler or watch Jerry Springer. The characters in this book would make great guests on those shows. And they're self-absorbed enough to enjoy doing it. To me, the reader, they're just boring.What sci-fi elements this book contains (jacking into one another's minds) isn't terribly original. From some unknown first time writer, this book would be acceptable pap. I guess I just expected something more from the author of THE FOREVER WAR."
1,A forced march through a grim landscape,"Should be titled: The Forever Piece of $#!@%. I threw it away with less than 100 pages to go. A forced march through a grim landscape of mind-melding and sexual equality. A stinker. Stupid plot, boring characters, heavy-handed, plodding, and lifeless. Blech! And this won the Nebula!"
1,One of the worst science fiction books I've read in years,"Forever Peace reminded me why I have cut down on my science fiction reading substantially. I very much enjoyed Forever War, The Worlds Trilogy and a number of other books I've read by Haldeman but Forever Peace is an abomination -- a piece of politically correct drivel -- and I very much doubt I'll read another one of Mr. Haldeman's novels. From now on, I believe that one science fiction novel a year should be more than sufficient."
1,Slow and not-engaging,"It's very rare that I give up on a book. But that's exactly what happened when I picked up Forever Peace. Every word was slow, and the characters have little depth. The only thing that kept me going was my own imagination. After forcing myself to keep reading, I just couldn't take it anymore and closed the book forever. Back to Card's Ender series for me... those are books I can't put down!"
2,Extremely disappointing,"Readers who have enjoyed other Haldeman books will find ""Forever Peace"" disappointing. The problems begin with the title, which, no matter what Haldeman's disavowals, inevitably asks us to compare it against his classic ""Forever War."" And, unlike that book, ""Forever Peace"" has no likable characters, including that protagonist. It also has a confused and forgettable series of plot threads which Haldeman himself seemingly loses interest in mid-way through the book. Not recommended."
3,Forever Read,"Although I made it through, it seemed like it took forever to finish this book. The complex plot machinations, the cast of dozens, the apocalyptic political vision, and a minimum of eye-popping technological progress 40 years into the future all conspired to make this a fairly grueling read.This is NOT a sequel or prequel to The Forever War, which is a much more readable and enjoyable book. In fact, the thousand years in TFW seem a mere fraction of the few months depicted here.And I certainly HOPE that Haldeman is wrong that interracial dating will still be a cultural taboo in 2043."
2,So so Sci-Fi,"It is difficult to imagine that this book received the Hugo Award. The story seems too weak for that. It is just another version of the same old story about scientists trying to save the universe from the crazies who are about to do it in. Religious crazies in this case are the bad guys. There is a lot of ""jacking"" and lots of war stuff. There are some twists to the plot and a little suspense but it doesn't amount to all that much. The characters are not strong but rather gray and not entirely believable. Still, though, not the worst science fiction I have read."
2,Disappointing,"How did this book win any awards? It was a major disappointment. I was expecting so much and got so little. Not only were the characters undeveloped, the plot was unbelievable. The author spent 95% of the story establishing the characters and their circumstances; 4% on setting up the big issue, (which happens to be the destruction of the entire universe); and 1% on the resolution (which involves nothing less then requiring the entire human race to undergo major surgery) If the people judging these major awards think this is good science fiction then we need new judges."
2,Morally Questionable,"The theme of this book is that mind control is good, and resisting mind control is bad. Except that even the brainwashed have dirty work to do, whacking the people who resist too hard, so they keep some unbrainwashed lackeys around for this purpose.The morality of this is so difficult to justify that Haldeman must invoke DESTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE as the consequence of failure. Talk about contrived! If you love Haldeman for his hard science and gritty truths, stay away from this book. The price of his Peace is too high."
2,"An epic, sweeping, visionary sense of nominal competency.","Not incoherent, but incohesive. The narrative leaps from first to third-person roughly every other page--why Haldeman did this, I don't know, since it adds absolutely nothing to the effect. It doesn't even achieve a stylish jarring effect, it's just...annoying.The plot verges on the plain silly, and logical problems peek out from several corners of the text. (For example: ten days in a group mind-meld month after month after month is just fine, but FOURTEEN days even once? Well, obviously that will remove the ability to kill ""except in self-defense"". Er...yeah!)The prose is competent, however, and it's a decent book to kill a couple afternoons with."
2,"Interesting ideas, but poor narrative","The ideas in FOREVER PEACE were interesting, and thought provoking. I was surprised to find myself questioning whether removing the violent impulses from people, changing human nature was really the right thing to do. Pondering this kept me involved with the book until the end.On the other hand, I thought the narrative stunk. One of the cardinal rules of writing, I always thought, was never to change point of view in the middle of the story. And yet Haldeman does this frequently. Most of the story is narrated in the first person. But whenever the plot tension started to build, and I started to get curious, it would switch into 3rd person, and this omniscient narrator would explain just what was going on, killing any sense of tension that existed. He would tell what the bad guys happened to be doing at that moment rather than waiting for the main character to find out. I thought this was a cop-out and spoiled the pacing of the book completely."
2,Big letdown after Forever War,"I remember the Forever War as one of my all time favorite works of Science Fiction that I reread numerous times. Forever Peace, which is not a sequel, was a disappointment from beginning to end. The characters were uninteresting with lots of time devoted to character development that added nothing to story or motivations. The science and implications of the technology was really full of holes you could drive trucks through. The evil cult was completely unbelievable and unidimensional. Finally, the ending left me completely flat. Without disclosing it, just think through the problems the second generation would encounter. All in all, Mr. Haldeman's writing skills did not improve with disuse after all these years."
1,This was a Hugo winner???,"I am a fan of Joe Haldeman and when I saw this was a Hugo winner I didn't think I could go wrong. I was sadly mistaken. I finished reading the book only because I thought it would get better. The book was slow paced, contrived and just not very interesting. My overall impression was the book was lacking in the plot, technical detail and character development normally associated with a work by Haldeman. Next time I will be more careful in spending my money on 'favorite' authors and Hugo winners."
1,It had to happen -,"I found a book by Joe Haldeman that I didn't like, and I REALLY didn't like it, for several reasons:The narrative switches back and forth from first to third person. Come on, I learned not to do that in junior high English! Plus, the switching is very frequent; every 4 or so pages. Very difficult and frustrating to keep track of what's going on.The plot is poorly contrived. It doesn't flow as well as his other novels.The amount of sexuality in the book. Not to be prudish, but good grief! With each Haldeman book I read, I notice more and more of an emphasis being put on this. Well, there's even more here, and it seemed very out of place.Actually, the first 10 pages are a good example of what this book could have been - Haldeman's trademark good writing. Afterwards, it just degenerates. Don't bother with it."
3,two unrelated books stuck together,"This book is really wierd. The first half is all about war in the future, where soldiers fight from bunkers and use virtual reality hook-ups to androids in the field. All of a sudden, Haldeman throws in this conflict from left field and the story takes off in a totally different direction. The war portion of the book is kinda slow- nothing much happens but description, setting, and background. If Haldeman did something with that portion, he could have made a really good book - I mean, he had enough technology and problems to talk about.The second part of the book was kinda over the top, even for science fiction. The characters solved their overwhelming problems way too easily. It got pretty intense and exciting towards the end, but like another reviewer said, the way the ending is written is really cheesy. Haldeman comes up with some cool ideas, but he doesn't take them as far or as deep as they can go."
3,Must have been a short list of HUGO nominees,"Despite the reviews, this book is not nearly as deep as the author would like us to believe. It is a nice story, with some not-so-innovative sci-fi, and a hard to believe ending. As has been previously mentioned, he takes a good, but quick read, and overly complicates the ending. Don't ask me why.If you're looking for an easy book for a rainy day, this might be a good choice. If you are in the mood to be challenged, you might want to look elsewhere."
4,Definitely NOT Forever War,"If you are hoping for a sequel to Joe Haldeman's stellar ""Forever War"" (despite Mr. Haledman's denial to the contrary) you will be disappointed. But if you approach ""Forever Peace"" as a completely separate set of ideas, the book becomes more readable. The battles between the military, bent on keeping an unnecessary war going, the religious nuts, determined to keep the Jupiter Project going in hopes of starting anew and the men and women who link with and fight the ""soldierboys"" creates enough tension to make the reader want to continue to the end to see who prevails, despite a rather dry narrative style and less than fully developed explanations of the technology."
5,Wonderful for teens and adults.,"We are homeschoolers and use this book for our 7th-10th graders. However it would be a wonderful addition to a conversion class, good for anyone seeking to grow in their Jewish observance and Mitzvot, or as a family activity or project.It is written from a very common sense and positive point of view. What a great addition to anyones library. The open concept of choosing a Mitzvot and working a step by step process through you growth is excellent. It allows for small steps and large ones at all levels."
4,"""Azal!! Azaaal! Azaaal!!!!"" OR The Doctor Turns Que Qui Quan","This was a very fun one. Full of magic, spells, sorcery, incantations, devils, etc. If you want one that includes all of this, this is for YOU! Even see The Doc put on a magic show. VERY FUN!"
1,Avoid the Kindle version,"Since the Kindle version was claimed to be optimized for larger screen, I initially downloaded this to the Kindle reader software on my pc. However, the music notation fragments were illegible because they are so small. I tried this file on my Kindle reader and on my iPhone as well, only to discover that the musical examples are of such low quality as to render them useless. Not good for a book on music theory. Perhaps the paper version would have been a better investment. Still, it's sad to see that publisher don't take electronic versions of their books seriously: please don't bother making ebooks if you're going to take the quality seriously."
4,"Lots of useful information, but don't get Kindle edition","I had this book and stupidly gave it away while clearing some shelves. I didn't believe you could learn to improvise from reading a book. I still think that's true, but the book still has lots of useful information. As I'm a computer programmer by trade, I guess I can't just relax and let go and play, but need to have some understanding of the underlying harmonic structure of a song to guide me. So I got this book again on my Kindle. However, on the Kindle, the musical staff and diagrams do not scale with the text and therefore some remain almost impossible to read clearly. Also, there are several examples of diagrams that contain a large bracket and nothing else. I know that there has to be more to them. For that reason, if you get this book I highly recommend that you get it in print and not on your Kindle.I'm ordering this book again. Looking forward to going through some of the musical examples and exercises."
2,MISSING SONGS ON CD,The cd lists 20 SONGS AND IT ONLY HAS 10 SONGS WHEN PLAYED. MAYBE THIS WAS A MISPRINT ON BEHALF OF SONY.THANK YOU
2,Kidz Mouse - A Bit on the Large Size,"Got this for god child's first computer. She three and does quite well. I was hoping it would be smaller. We have a laptop mouse that works better but is not as cute. Knew it had two buttons, would have preferred just one for left clicks. If your child has fairly large hands, this mouse could work well. Amazon's shipping was great as always."
1,not optimal for a 2 year old mac user,"I bought this mouse as an alternative to my wireless mighty mouse. first off the length of the usb cable is out of control who needs 5' of cable? the company website has the one button driver link so hidden it took a search engine targeted search to turn it up and i doesn't support Mac configurations. there is little or no support info on the site, via the email or phone number included. I ultimately downloaded steermouse so i could configure this overpriced piece of plastic to be a one button mouse for my son. i would not recommend this mouse. i would rather have just gotten him an old used mouse.edited to add:after a month or more of fiddling this mouse is still a piece of junk."
5,Great mouse for little hands,I bought this mouse for my 3 1/2 year old son and it's great. I love that it comes with a USB adapter so I can just plug it into the USB port on my keyboard. There's no software to install and you don't have to disconnect your regular mouse in order to use this mouse. My son loves it and it is so easy for him to use. I only paid $...
3,"Not exactly what I expected, but still ok.","First of all, I didn't get a ladybug like I ordered, I got a frog, but oh, well. Second, I thought that the mouse was supposed to be more child friendly, meaning that the sellers made me think that both buttons would do the same thing and I wouldn't constantly be telling my three year old to only use her pointer finger to click on the right hand side! Otherwise, it's great. My daughter is really getting comfortable with it and I love a USB port mouse!"
5,Not So Bad For Adult Hands,"I needed a mouse for my three-year-old nephews that didn't have a scroll wheel to interfere with their kiddie computer games. This mouse has turned out to be the perfect option. There have been no issues with installation or use, and I am pleased with the product on every level.Also, I find the mouse easy to use for adult hands too. Though I did have to initially adopt a few different surfing habits (I typically rely heavily on the scroll wheel), this house hasn't slowed my Internet experience down. More important to me is that I've sat and used the mouse for hours at a time with no strain."
2,Mapping left-click didn't work,"I bought this mouse for my two year old son, because I thought the regular mouse was too big for him. I picked this particular mouse because the description(or other written reviews) said that both left and right click functions, could be mapped into one. Well that did not happen for me, I downloaded and ran the program-uninstalled and tried so many times. Yet it didn't work-mapping the functions into one didn't. Anyway,less than a week later of using the regular mouse, my son has mastered its use, and we no longer have any use for this kidz mouse."
5,Call down lightning,Great book. Clear writing with succinct explanations. No wasted words. I am using this book to build from no doubt.
5,Home Made Lightning,"This book is eye opening in that it awakens you to the fact that many traditional explanations of electricity do not explain all of the properties of electricity. A wonderful reference work. The illustrations are old, perhaps because the research seemed to stop around the 1930's. His chapter 6 on ""Theories of generator operation"" is excellent. His statement that ""It is fair to say that there are as many theories as there are inventors of original generator designs."" inspirers you to learn about all of the other designs. The book is packed with extensive references and I have recently acquired many of them. Although his references concerning Nikola Tesla are not pronounced, at least he mentions him in chapter 21 ""Some philosophical conclusions and insights"". Final answer: If I lose the book, I'll buy another!"
5,My son Edgar laughs and never gets tired of Some Cows,"I wisely packed the book Some Cows to a casting call. If you know those ""experiences,"" a poor child can sit around for an hour or two before they are called. I believe we read the book no less than fifty times in ninety minutes. It could have been a disaster but Edgar stayed with the book each time and wanted more. As the reader I was pleased that it is clever in rhyming and giving these little cows personality. The artists also provde such pleasant humorous illustrations. These are not cows that I can easily forget. If you're going to read a book over again, I would recommend this one very very much."
1,Out of touch with corporate reality,"By FAR the most useless book in my pretty extensive collection... Unimaginative, repetitive, simple minded, out of touch with corporate reality. I always get at least a few ideas from books, but this one was basically a string of half-baked, fluffy ""paint your feelings"" activities that would get me laughed right out of the room. Unbeliavable."
4,Some Good Exercises,"For anyone planning to give a presentation on leadership or develop a class on leadership, this book has quite a few helpful exercises. On the flip side, some exercises are better classified as ice breakers and meeting openers than true leadership exercises."
3,This is vintage B Style Western material.,"I grabbed this movie in the close-out bin, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story and smaltzy production values. Doug McLure is working hard to make this film work, and his acting shines, bringing the character alive. Co-Star Angelica Ott, is breathtakingly beautiful. The colorful scenery and sublime storyline-give this movie cult/sleeper status. The Fox animated series, ""The Simpsons"" would always parody the Doug McLure character and portray him as making forgotten-B movies that no one ever heard of-and this could certainly be one of them. Now, I get the joke. Regardlessit is an enjoyable view, and probably very much under-rated and swept under the cobwebs of time. Find it, dust it off, and enjoy. I saw a DVD version-which was pretty much a straight transfer with only Chapter Selection for features.Grab it if you can."
3,Good source book but not very inspirational,"I bought this book about a year ago. I have 8-10 doll house books now, and this is not one I look through very often. It is good for checking up details like which colour the wall papers usually had during the Victorian era, and some of the descriptions of how to make for example a fire look realistic are good, but many of the pictures are really boring and they dont make you wanna copy the design. There are lots of other books that are more inspirational."
5,Great Book!,"This book is wonderful to look at and very helpful. Especially if you want a period look or a very english look to your dollhouse, which is just what I was looking for. Great value for the money. I find myself looking through it all the time."
4,"Fun, crafty and idea filled","This is a great book for anyone who is restoring a dolls' house and would like some history, architectural information and handy patterns for creating small 1:12 scale furniture and items. There are great pieces throughout regarding wallpaper, design elements, equipment needed, walls, framing, fire places, roofing, house finishes and much more. If you're busy restoring a dolls' house or are just interested in the hobby this book is fun to flip through as well as a great reference piece."
3,Maybe Once I Am More Involved,"As a beginner, beginner to dollhouse building I found this book interesting but a bit advanced in my experience. However, I can see where this book would be a great resource once I get a little more experience in building and decorating dollhouses -especially when I tackle little dollhouse community I plan on accomplishing. It helps define the different decorating periods and will help make your dollhouse as authentic to real-life as you wish."
5,smells like heaven,"I tried this as part of a multi product set that I ordered from a TV shopping network. When I first opened the product, the pungent lemon scent was so clean and invigorating, it almost made it worth getting out of bed every morning and dragging myself to the shower. The conditioner is so thick that a tiny amount is enough for my very long hair. Rinsing it out is easy and my hair is left smellling clean and feeling soft."
3,Ok but not enough room for pieces,"This is a nice-looking Advent calendar but there is not enough felt space to stick all the days' pieces on without it looking very crowded. Additionally, the pieces don't have enough hook-and-loop tape on the backs to keep them from drooping. I wouldn't buy this again and am considering returning it."
1,Very disappointed,This item is very cheap. The Velcro on the pieces doesn't even stick to the top part of the calendar. All the smaller pieces ended up being cat toys...
2,Too cheap,"The animals and people only attach to the green area. Which makes everything squished by Christmas. Everything is about the same size: the people, the presents, and the animals. My son was frustrated and so was I."
5,Sonic would read this book (if he was alive).,This is a great book for any Sonic Adventure owner. It is very detailed and has great tips with roll-through maps of all the levels. It's the only way to get all the A emblems.
5,Very Informative,I have read a lot of information regarding PCOS. This book did an excellent job of explaining the complexities PCOS. It also addressed the treatment alternatives for infertility related to PCOS. I would recommend this book to anyone who has been recently diagnosed.
4,Amazing and Important History.,"I am a direct decendant of Peter and Christabel Bielenberg and I was absolutely facinated when I watched this video. I beleive it was a almost perfect portrail of Christabel and her experiances as a German in the war. I also think that if you had not read the book ""I once was a German"" by Christabel Bielenberg you would have been lost several times in the film. But overall it was a great experiance."
1,Not as great as it looks,"My son (2.5 yrs) and I were rather disappointed with this item, even though he loves stickers and airplanes. Perhaps it would be more enticing to older kids, but he (and I) found that we were pretty limited in placing the stickers in a sensible way. The also didn't come off easily after first-time use."
4,WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE OF ALL WORKS FEATURED,"A great performance by all the artists of all 3 keyboard concertos, and the additional works too. It was also an added bonus to have the complete work of the Italian Concerto which up to now, I have only ever had the first movement of on a different compilation. To now have the full work featured additionally on this CD was an excellent surprise."
2,not downloadable!,I bought this CD speciffically for the purpose of downloading it on to my IPOD for my yoga classes. For some reason it wiil not download on to my computer. It does play on my car CD player though. I'm disappointed not to be able to use it for my classes.
3,Basic Reference book,"Good for reference. Shows the old, basic stitches, but it's good to read the history. I enjoy having books in my library that give different options for the same stitch."
2,gilmorur sprinkler,This product is difficult to set and difficult to set firmly in the ground. Setting the arc of the sprinkler is awkward and not at all intutive as on other sprinklers. Does not stay upright as the ground around it gets wet. Bulky and not at all easy to use. Wish I had not bought it.
1,defective nozzle,The Turbine Rotor Sprinkler was defective and could not be used. Apparently there is an air space or leak of some sort and the water sprays back from the female connection when the hose is inserted. It gives the appearance of a non-existent washer or a defective washer but that is not the case. I inserted a new washer and the same back spray occurred.
3,big and bulky but works,"Even though it i big and bulky, it does work.the most powerful stream could be tighter andshoot farther like the cheapeer all plastic sprinklers.There is a gear driven more low profile one that I havethat is not as big that I have so I will probably ordermore of those and return this one. It is also super quietand the part number is B000CSYKGK, it actually seems likeit just went up in price to 13.75, but still worth it."
5,Gilmore Turbine Rotor Sprinkler........a best buy,"Sounds like this discussion of 1 pro and 1 con needs a tie breaker opinion. I purchased this sprinkler because due to low water pressure in our neighborhood a sprinkler system was not able to be installed without tooooooooo many zones.This sprinkler is rated at 15 psi and above and since our water company is only obligated to give 29 gpm as their minimum pressure requirements I decided to try this Gilmore. It works fantastically, the spray pattern is straight out from the nozzle so setting the boundries was accurate and unlike the impulse sprinklers that I have been using for years it continues to rotate and water the area that it is set for without the annoying overspray of watering the sidewalks or street. Its a keeper as far as performance, only time will tell its longevity."
3,Great...for ONE season,"The sprinkler is very quiet. It sprays evenly, with a nice 20' radius. The distance of the spray is adjustable by using a sliding baffle...unfortunately, the sliding red plastic baffle comes apart from the sprinkler and is lost easily. I used the sprinkler for one season...went to use it for another, but a section of the turbine gears were stripped which stalled the sprinkler in one spot...making it pretty much useless."
4,Great sprinkler!,"We love this sprinkler. It's great for our yard with a privacy fence on one side. We set up the margins of the fence so the water stops before it gets to it, that way water is not wasted on the fence. It has a good range and we don't have to move it around to get the entire yard watered."
2,Cheap Construction,"I had an earlier model of this sprinkler (water-driven turbine) and liked it a lot for watering a very odd-shaped back yard. It lasted about one season and then started to rotate intermittently. I took it apart and could not find any reason that it would be doing this. I ordered the present model and it worked even better. However, the combination of the normal spray pattern and some leakage from the pressed-on female hose connection of the stake, enough water pooled on the ground around the stake-base that it gave way in the ensuing mud. It then started to gush water from the bottom of the unit, and essentially was useless. Due to the construction, I could not take it apart to see if it had failed in a repairable way. The all plastic construction is bad enough, but I think even that has been flimsy enough to make these products useless.Oh yes, and the tip of the long spike of the base broke off some time in the first few uses. The entire product is poorly fabricated."
3,Do not think I will buy Gilmore,"I bought this sprinkler in Feb. to hook up to an automatic timer while I was on vacation. I did not want to write a hasty review until I saw what it would do in very hot weather. The problem with this sprinkler is that the distance and spray path are controlled by one knob. You either get distance or you get a smaller/wide path of spray. I found it totally unacceptable for my needs, as my grass was not getting the water it needs even though I had it run for 1.5 hours every other day. It is very quiet and seemed ok, but I do not believe you get the water volume that you do from other sprinklers. I switched it to my old metal pulsator where I can adjust the distance with the lever on top and adjust the spray with tightening or loosening a screw. The Gilmore also does not spray any water around the base so that will remain bone dry."
5,Family and Friends,"The Windshift Line takes us on a single woman's journey into her fears, her identity, her relationship with family, death and loss. It portrays a loving and strong family, and the roles people play within the family. It speaks to the value of community, of the natural world, of the bond with animals and the openness to love and express joy.It is beautifully written, lyrical."
5,Vital Episode!!!!,"This is one of the more important episodes of Doctor Who in terms of enlightening us about Gallifrey and Time Lord society. This episode expands on ideas from ""The Hand of Omega"". We get more information about Rassilon and his masterpiece, The Eye of Harmony. This is also quite possibly one of the best crafted episodes in terms of pitting The Doctor against The Master. Some find the ""dream sequence"" boring but it is, in fact, an interesting comment on psychological warfare. This episode also make the transition between the Sarah-Jane Smith era and that of Leela the Barbarian. Anyone who wants to be a serious Doctor Who fan absolutely must become familiar with this episode!"
5,Doctor Who The Deadly Assassin,The Doctor Who that broke all the rules and got it ideas from some unique sources. First time The Doctor is not only without a companion but returns to his home planet to stop a Presidential assassin. 30 years before the Matrix movies and years before Disney Tron we have the doctor's mind entering the computer net to go him to mind against his enemy on all sorts of battle fields taken from the writers favorite movie ideas likes Hitchock's North by Northwest. Both the Time Lords and The Master has had previous appearances but this is the story that Doctor Who Fans first remember them appearing.
3,Great price but broken tablets were a problem,"I have ordered this product from Amazon on several occassions. The price is great, much better than in the local stores that carry it. The last shipment was a disappointment becuase several if the tablets got broken and there was green powder throughout the bottle. I will place another oder and hope it doesn't come back with the same issue."
2,Caused memory problems,"I am a 22 year old asian male and bought this product just to catch the nutrients that my diet did not. Reading all the good reviews about energy, I expected the same. I can not say anything definitive about the energy but I did experience some problems with memory and mental clarity. When I took this multivitamin I began to miss classes and appointments among other things. I figured it might be the multivitamin so I stopped for a few months. I came back to it a few days ago and I made a fool of myself by failing to complete a simple day-project the same day that I took it in the morning. I felt indecisive and a little confused.It might be just me but I want to give a heads up to others. Not sure what it might have caused it, whether its the large doses of certain vitamins or the many different added health ingredients. I would not recommend it to others lest they suffer the same embarrassment."
3,"Good, but confused","For those who are stuck between jobs, or who are contemplating a change, this book makes a fine companion to ""Ask the Headhunter"" by Nick Corcodilos.The title says it all: if you're looking for a job and you line up with the herd, you will lose. Become a salesman (of yourself) and win.I used some of the techniques in this book to land my last job and I can attest to how well they work. The book is also very easy to read, as all of the concepts are chopped up into small bite-sized chunks, the writing is natural, and the subject matter is not difficult.Unfortunately about half-way through, Rosaluk forgets his topic and starts writing about these useless tips on how to reformat your resume, how to make it better, etc. (That's why he only gets 3 stars)Keep reading the title; that is the key. It works."
1,Stongest Man in the world,"Save your money folks this is a bad movie. A horrible sequel to The computer wore tennis shoes and Now you see him now you don't. I am a huge fan of most of the movies Kurt Russell did with Disney in his younger years, but keep your credit card tucked away for this one. Bad jokes, bad script, bad movie."
1,Weakest movie in the world,"Fans of the World's Strongest Man contests should be warned about this movie. It has nothing to do with the famous strongman contest, rather it is a cornball Disney movie with all the hallmarks of production line film making. The script is just too cheesy for words. You could say that the film hasn't traveled well, but it is doubtful whether the kids of the 1970s when it was made thought very highly of it either judging by the way it bombed at the box office. It's films like this which made the Disney name box office poison in the 1970s and 80s. Avoid."
4,"Good TV, but a little expensive",By far the best picture quality I have seen on an LCD TV of this type. It costs a little more but it is well worth the price. Keep an eye out at local retailers for discounted or open box items since many people do not realize that this is not a widescreen or HD quality TV and return it.
5,"Fun, thought-provoking","I found this calendar to be even better than previous ones by the author. Some puzzles involve a bit of mathematics. Some are zany and fun. Some involve words. Some make me laugh.Instructive, provocative, addictive, and fun.They are especially useful in the classroom or even at parties. I've taken the first five puzzles from the calendar and distributed them to my classroom. That really gets the students mind in gear."
5,good film making,disney did a good thing shooting a movie about a wheel chair bound boy named Justin Yoder(based on a true story). I also like the scenes when they are in the court room deciding whether Justin should play baseball or not I like how the mom always defends him because hes handicapped and should have the right to play. this is a good movie.
3,Good Movie,It's about a boy who is handicapped and his brother has alot of Trophy's and he wish's he had a Trophy but they asked if he could play in sports and the Coach's would say no so when Justin see's this movie the guy made who lives across the street he tells his parents he wants to play in Soap Box Derby at the final race at Soap Box Derby Justin's dream come's true.This movie is a True story.You may deffintely want to buy this movie.
5,I could relate,"I have a vision impairment, so I could relate to having over-protective parents, but the thing that I related to more was Justin's brother. I had a severely handicapped brother (he passed away when he was 10) and so I can DEFINITELY understand where the brother was coming from. There is a constant struggle between wanting the same amount of attention that your ""special"" sibling is getting and being afraid something will happen to that sibling.So in a nutshell, I thought it was a great movie. The part at the end where Justin gets to see what heaven looks like was kinda weird, but I think it was just a way of saying that in heaven everyone is on an even playing field."
5,Great movie for everyone!!,"Let me start out by saying that even though this is a Disney movie, I'm 29 and I love it! It's the true story of an Indiana boy who has Spina Bifida and all he dreams about is winning a trophy in anything. After several misshaps, he gets insterested in soap box racing and becomes successful at it. The movie is not overly sentimental or sappy and is very truthful in how disabilities affect families. It shows that no matter what, if you dream about something and work to make it happen, it will happen. Another thing it teaches is that some people discriminate against those that have disabilities and that anyone, even a teenage boy can overcome those who discriminate.See it on the Disney Channel, Rent it on video or buy it for your own collection (I own it)."
1,Not Sony OEM / Cheap Generic Knockoff,"The battery works, but it is not a Sony OEM battery as is shown in the picture. This is simply an overpriced generic battery that luckily works with my Sony Vaio. Don't be misled by the picture. The battery you will receive has no Sony markings on it whatsoever. This is borderline false advertising."
1,they just don't work,"Are these actually Michele Jaffe's first books, published now because of the success of the WATER NYMPH, et.al.? Both books are set in Renaissance England (circa 1590), but they don't ring true. For example, one character speaks of ""five broken engagements."" Persons of rank were ""bethrothed"" not engaged; these were legal contracts that one did not simply walk away from. At another point, three guards whip out pistols, ready to aim and shoot. These guns weren't available at this time. Another character wonders about the media market for his crimes.These read like books that were originally set in another time period and were changed to capitalize on the success of her earlier published works. But someone should have EDITED them."
1,Not great,"At first I was very confused about what was going on. After about 44 pages I started to enjoy the book. But after I got farther I didn't care for it. The author essentially lies to you about things. I understand building suspense and mystery, but Jaffe didn't do that she out right lied about what was going to happen. The characters started to be enjoyable, but then they weren't believable at all. I only read Secret Admirer. I have no interest in reading Lady Killer."
2,Elizabethan??,"While I did enjoy the mystery of these two books, I was simply unable to get a hold of the time period in which they were set. If Jaffe hadn't initially put the time period in 1590, and occasionally mentioned the Spanish War and the fact that Elizabeth was the queen, I would have assumed that this book was set either loosely in the Regency period or in the Victorian period. There were none of the little historical details which place a book in one period over another, and many that jarred."
2,"A miss, not a hit.","I too really liked Michele Jaffe's earlier books and was eager to read these. But they are not of the same caliber. SECRET ADMIRER is set during the Renaissance, yet the characters behave and speak like modern people. They do not behave true to their time period. It's disconcerting. And the action is abrupt, moving from point to point without taking the reader along. Where oh where was the editor?"
4,Ladykiller,"Okay I just read Ladykiller and loved it! I couldn't really get into Secret Admirer I don't know why but. I love the main character and her quirks and it was just an awesome love story, Loved how they did the deed and she came up with another crack in the case. Too cute Loved the love story!"
5,"Far better than that ""Complete Directory"" book","Why is it that that ""Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows"" is now in an 8th edition, while ""Harry and Wally"" has been out of print for years? The ""Complete Directory"" is nothing but a dry, boring recitation of shows' premises, whereas ""Harry and Wally"" is like a roundup of well-written short essays on whether some obscure show would be worth your time. (I refered to it recently when Trio did a special run of ""East Side/West Side."") The more classic the show, the better and longer the write-up, too. They also score extra credit with me, as an original series ""Star Trek"" die-hard, for a great write-up on my favorite series.I've hoped for years for an updated edition of Harry and Wally. C'mon guys, where did you go? What gives?"
5,TOUGH AS NAILS,"GREAT NAILER , easy to carry, worth every dollar, put it to good use right out of the box and paid for itself already"
2,good gun but short life,"This gun is great, except for the short life span. I've gone through five of the guns over the last 2 years. I install base board in track housing, so hose free is almost necessity. I did the math and they shoot about 100,000 nails before they wear out, which could last a life time for some. My batteries are all worn out and its time to switch to a pneumatic hitachi."
1,Good seller,I bought this product for my husband and he has been happy with it. The product was right with its decription.
4,Excellent for Gothic Story Lovers,The mood of the film is richly put. Peter O'toole is deliciously wicked. The film is definetely for the artsy/Masterpiece theater types.
2,Okay...,"A bit long and drawn out. O'Toole does a fine job as a creepy dude. But...long and drawn out. The girl is beautiful and charismatic, though. I saw her in the Pierce Brosnan movie ""Mr. Johnson"" and fell in love with her there. I thought she might be a big star...but this movie is the only other time I've seen her. And bland, so-so looking women like Julia Roberts become big stars. It's all a crap shoot. If you watch this movie in a big, dark house, all alone, you'll probalby get nightmares!"
3,invisibility is the key word here!,"The brazilian human beings described as ""caboclos"",surely deserve to finaly become part of the mainstream civilization in their own country! Truth is that it is not an easy task, due to human nature , you know... kind of like human intolerance... It's similar to the concept of ""Hiphenated- America""... Antropologists and sociologists wouldn't be able to cure such malade! The heart of the problem and the answer to it could only be fixed by an individual's desire to do better within oneself. To remember Christ's commendment to ""Love one another"". To mind the ""Golden rule"" and do unto other as one wants done unto oneself. Children need to be treated with respect, in order to grow up and teach respect to others. Children need to be taught of HOPE, and that is a most important element, one which is missing from the life of the peasant caboclo..."
3,Mis-matched..,"Although a recommended match, the case is much to small to accomodate camera. Used for a smaller camera, worked great. Charger is a convenient addition."
2,Batteries,OK but Starter kit should not be suggest because not good batteries for the camera i bought. thank you
1,A bit too much,"I did not like this video ""A Bit of Fry and Laurie"", (though I love the Jeeves and Wooster Tapes). I did find a few skits very funny in the beginning. Later some of the skits went on too long and the timing seemed off or some of the humor became very crude. I did not watch it to the end. On the other hand I have watched the Jeeves and Wooster tapes so many times (almost nightly) that I have lost count. I gave this video one star because I did not want to watch it again and I returned it."
3,OK strings at a reasonable price,"I bought these strings since they are the strings suggested by the manufacturer for my Ovation Legend. They have a nice sound but are not as bright as my usual strings, D'Addario EXP16's. They cost less than the D'Addarios, so that is an advantage to consider, but I decided after one set of adamas to go back to the D'As."
3,beautiful but heavy,"it is a beautiful product, seems to be reliable,but i had to return it sooner, cause it was as heavy asa hammer. i do not know may be i used to use plasticband watches thats why i found it so heavy.if you do not mind the weight go for it..."
3,"Bad horror-thriller, but a good novel of madness.","Like the Bachman novel ""Rage"", this one too, is about madness, and hate, and how some people just want to destroy everything when they go mad. That is why this is so realistic, but it might be a bit harmful to some readers because of its ""solution"" to the hate---a shootout. A clever book about a railway being built by some guy's house, who has to have his house removed. He doesn't like this, so day by day, he plans his revenge. It's a hard to understand bok, and overall, I wouldn't say it is a good book because of its contents and negative point of view but I wouldn't say its bad because it says: ""Speak out your feelings."""
3,A book for people who enjoy test patterns,"Roadwork is a novel with short snatches of interesting parts, buried in a whole lotta nothing. Some of the things just didn't make sense, and the unconscience dialogue form he mastered in his later novels detracts alot from the story. A colossal waste of time if you value plots that are thought out ahead of time, not just held together by chewing gum and string."
3,"I read this entire book , and I don't know what is about.",I read this book all the way through. And by the end I was still confused. I know he goes crazy and starts a shoot out. But what the hell? Can someone explain to me?
3,Not a good deal,I realize it is my fault but I was very disappointed when I received the book as it is a story that I have in a book that has several stories in it. I will have to search what I have aready carefully so i don't make this mistake again.
2,Disappointing,"Very well written and one I hadn't read before (thought I'd read all the Bachman books) and I kept waiting for that ""Stephen King"" thang to happen and it never did. The story was horribly depressing and, IMHO, pointless. If I had known it was going to be just another descent-into-madness story, I would never have bought it. It just lacked SK's magic."
2,does not work,"this is perhaps my least favorite of SK's horror/thriller. a guy lives where a road is planned. he has to move. his job and marriage gets endangered to, and he decides he wants the roadwork stopped. so he begins taking matters into his own hands. this book doesn't deliver. i got the feeling that the guy was an idiot who deserved what was coming to him, and very little the feeling that the road was to blame. the guy has just sort of given up. i don't feel taht much sympathy for him. i mean: his job is not that great and he endagers it himself, as an example. in the end it all was too little tied up with the roadwork. no great descriptions or psychology either."
4,"Not what I expected, but good nonetheless","This early Bachman novel is a far cry from the normal Stephen King novel (but that was part of the point, wasn't it?). It is the story of one man's response to the news that a new freeway is being built through where his house stands. To be short, he doesn't like it; and after a while, he decides to do something about it. I won't say anymore about the story, but this is in many ways a character study. It is not plot driven; a lot of it is just watching him go about his day and what he is thinking and doing. Things happen, but they are not important things. This is much more low-key than the other Bachman books, but still satisfying."
3,Slow King novel. Not one of his better ones.,I'm a diehard King fan. I love his early work and recent work but this book didn't do it for me. Some parts were interesting but overrall the pace was way too slow and the characters didn't have that special element that King always give his characters to make them come alive. Dawes is a disgruntled and very depressing character that I had a tough time following. Takes too long to get to the good part of the story. I realize King's novels often time have a slow build as he develops the character(s) but something was missing here.
3,The shaky cease-fire still holds,"Like movies, some books just get old.The book is full of allegories and direct references. Snip: (...)"
2,My least favorite Stephen King novel,"It's hard for me to give any King book less than 4 stars, but this just wasn't my kind of novel. I think he was trying to show us the inner battle inside this troubled character, but it just wasn't something I could get into. I just couldn't wait to hurry up and finish it. It's not poor writing (again, LOVE STEPHEN KING) but I would recommend dozens of his other books before I would recommend this one.If you're looking for a phenomenal Stephen King novel, I would strongly recommend ""IT."""
4,Early Stephen King is good Stephen King,"There are four books inside the Bachman Books; Roadwork is the weakest of the four. That being said, early Stephen King is good Stephen King. It's lean and mean, written with a tone that isn't so much trying to scare you as it is trying to hurt you. And I love that about King. It's the--screw you reader, take it and shut up--that I love about early King. It might not be the best work he has done, but it's still better than 99% of everyone else. If you love early King, read it.James Roy Daley, author of The Dead ParadeThe Dead Parade"
5,Deserves More Credit,"This, my 12th King novel, definitly ranks up there in the top 5.If anyone dares say that Stephen King cannot write serious literature, then he has not read ""Roadwork.""While not horror in the vein of Pet Semetary or Salem's Lot, Roadwork focuses on the unthreading of an average middle-class man, who becomes victim to progression. A man who has to relocate his work and home to another side of town because of a highway project, begins acting strange, and slowly loses his grip, and becomes ""unplanted.""The character development is so rich that it is scary. Those who are strict adhereers to the horror genre may not get much out of this, but those who enjoy fiction in general, and who have an appreciation for the subtle details which make for a complete literary experience, will want to indulge in this poignant world of anti-progression."
3,Average by just about all standards,"This book had some serious potential, the problem is, the first 2/3rds of this book were setting up the story. Unlike other Bachman stories, this one just takes to long to get moving. Once it does, it's a great story, much like the movie falling down. Had this book been 100 pages longer, it probably would've gotten the other 2 stars... but alas, it just ends to quickly"
1,Not Kingly at all,"I did not give this book one star because it is a bad story or badly written. I did so because when I buy a King book, I expect the presence of certain elements. This book contained none of them. No paranormal phenomena, no suspense, no eerie-ness. Nothing was scary or gruesome. It was just a story of the straw that broke the camel's back. Not awful, just not what I wanted."
1,a really stupid book,"Well, the begining is really boring. But I continued to read. I hoped something interesting would happen, but nothing really did. The whole book is about a guy that is crazy. In the end, he blows himself up, which is the best part because thats when the book stops. If you read this review, I suggest you don't bother wasting your money on this poor excuse of a book."
3,Road work,"Never finished reading this book, I USUALLY DEVOUR MY STEPHEN KING books, but this one didn't draw me in for some reason."
2,"Bland, tedious, forgettable","This is perhaps King's worst effort. Or if there is one worse, I can't think of it. The plot isn't particularly imaginative -- just about a working stiff slowly losing it, and the writing it takes to get there is just plain bad. I'd be willing to bet that half the people who review this book could do better. Yeah, that bad. And tedious! The unfolding of the unravelling of the inevitable happening is so slow and so unreasonable and so full of old, tired, imitative cliches, that all we want is for him to just get on with it already, so we can start a new book. No surprises, nothing original to engage us. My head got a stomach ache. Definitely the worst of the so-called Bachman books. Ranks along Rose Madder and Insomnia as one of King's top worst books. Worth purchasing if it's part of a collection -- but on its own? Are you crazy?! Never! Don't do it."
2,Not impressed,I am a huge fan and I have say this is one of my least liked books. I would not recommend it.
5,Great game for the little crowd!,"Minimal to no reading. Easy to navigate. Games are very easy to figure out. Great beginner's game for those who are still learning to use controls! My 5 year old loves it. However, I could see this as being VERY boring for a non-beginner! The games are redundant which is why it works so well for the newbie, younger crowd. I would say a MAX age of 7 for this game."
4,Good Book.,"This was a fine book. It tells tales from the origins of Okinawan martial arts. It reflects an extremely positive philosophy for karate specifically and martial arts in general. It's well written and entertaining.Unfortunately, as history, it's quite weak. The almost utter lack of dates & times and something less than a linear chronology just take away from this aspect of the work.I do recommend it, but be aware that while it tells wonderful and fascinating stories and contains a powerful and compelling point of view, it just is not a good reference book for any sort of history of Okinawan karate."
5,Superb book on the origins of karate.,Richard Kim does an excellent job describing the development of Okinawan karate. He delves into the history of the art as well as the personalities and exploits of the masters. His stories both educate and enlighten the reader. This book will serve as a source of information and motivation to any karate stylist.
3,Painterly or Sloppy?,"The author admits he is not a detail-oriented or patient person. His ""painterly"" style is a little too-loose for me. I had a hard time figuring out what some of the marks in his paintings were or what they represented, and the colors often seemed muddy. Some people like this slap-dash style; it you do, this is the book for you."
3,Not quite what I needed,"The Griffin Xpress is the length I needed (3 meters/10 feet), but the mini-jack adapters are too big for the digital audio output on my Power Mac G4 (Digital Audio) music server. Also, the standard size Toslink connector did not fit well on my Yamaha receiver. It did not ""snap"" into place and bent (won't close completely) the protective flap on the Yamaha jack."
2,Non-clean,"As I have read from others on this page, I too have a very difficult time in getting this item CLEAN. I spray Pam to begin with and use Brillo and still this pan does not come clean. Grease and food items stick and won't be dislodged no matter how many times you scrub the darn thing. If I could, I would return it pronto. If someone could forward me the company address or phone numberRANGE KLEEN BP102X PORCELAIN BROILER PAN & GRILLthat produces this pan I would greatly appreciate it."
2,Did I miss the statement that my pan would be damaged?,"I was so excited to find these broiler pans at such a good price, I ordered 2 for less than the Range Kleen website could get me just one. Then when they were delivered, I found out why they were so much cheaper -- both pans were seriously bent down on one corner. Luckily the grill rack is equally bent, so it still works. But since the porcelain finish has peeled, I am expecting rust to overtake the pan and rack before too long.If it weren't for the damage, these broiler pans would get 5 stars."
1,Too small,"This was too small, even for a single person. I didn't pay attention to the dimensions, so I had to send it back."
3,Damaged,"The broiler pan arrived damaged due to poor packaging. One edge of the pan and grill were bent and the porcelain was chipped. I was able to bend it back and make it usable, but the cracked porcelain has opened a place for rust to form. Also, as more porcelain chips off the two pieces continue to scratch against one another.I guess this is a case of, ""you get what you pay for."" It will do for now, but unfortunately it will have to be replaced in a few years."
2,Non-stick didn't work,"I can't get the grill completely clean... even though I used scratch-free Comet,a scrubber and scrubbed for 10 minutes!. Very disappointing. It also warped slightly after the first couple of uses. Doesn't work as advertised."
2,Not real functional,"I found this pan a bit disappointing. It actually warped ever so slightly after first use and it's hard to clean. Unless I use steel wool to clean it, which is not reccommeneded, there remains a film of fat and grease on the surface. So I'm still in search of a good replacement for my very very old broiling pan..."
4,standard broiler pan,"It's a standard broiler pan, not much else to say. Food cooks well on it; it's a nice size. It's kind of hard to clean when the food gets burnt on, but that's true of all broiler pans."
2,Hard to clean,"PROs Perfect size, substantial weight, well coatedCONs Unfortunately, I cannot get the Range Kleen pan clean, and I'm not hard on cookware. My old broiler pan cleaned up well--but not this one. From the other reviews, I guess you either get a good finish or you don't--we didn't, therefore cannot recommend."
3,Broiler pan,"Came in undamaged package. It is a good size and does what it is supposed to. Nothing about it stands out. Good value for the price. Mine came a little damaged on one edge, but not enough to trouble with replacing it."
3,It's OK! Looks good.,"I used it for the first time Thanks Giving Turkey, and it was hard to clean. So not a non stick product!Otherwise, it's OK."
2,Broiler Pan,"The broiler pan instructions state to not use aluminum foil on the pan, which we had always done in the past. We tried broiling chicke directly on the pan and after scrubbing and running it throught the diswasher, which is only 2 months old, the pan did not come clean. We are now using foil again,"
5,just what I was looking for,"I had an old broiler similiar to this for about 40 years. When it finally gave out, two clicks at Amazon found this one. Works great, cleans easy---if it just will last 40 years....."
4,"small, but too big for our large toaster oven!","This is a fantastic, high quality broiler pan, feels like a tank! high gloss enamel black, i was so excited when i got this, however it is too wide for our toatster/convection oven, which is what i got it for! we have a black and decker convection counter top oven with 12"" pizza capacity, so i thought this would fit no problem, but it is a little too wide. oh well still searching for the ultimate broiler toaster oven pan. do yourself a favor and measure before you buy (oops!)"
1,Cheap and flimsy.,"For some reason, my range did not come with a broiler pan so I bought this one. This isn't a quality product, it's flimsy and looks cheap. I don't recommend it."
3,Definately not a NON-STICK pan,"I have used it several times since I bought this on Amazon as we do a majority of our cooking using a broiler pan ~ It’s Healthier! This boiler pan is only slightly better when it comes to ease of cleaning compared to the original broiler pan that came with our over a few years ago. It is definitely not NON STICK. Food does stick. Handwashing does clean it the best. Our newer dish washer was not able to get it clean, which was disappointing, adding a step.I don’t think there is any NON-STICK broiler pan on the market. If there is, I have not found it."
3,Too hard to clean,"I don't know what porcelain means in this kind of pan, but it does not clean as well as stainless steel. I have been unable to remove stains from food that stuck to the bottom."
2,Not What I Expected,"Range Kleen Broiler Pan a disappointment. After very first use could not get it clean. It is supposed to be coated so that you don't have to scrub. Well, it doesn't seem that way."
4,Good Smoker Pan,I have been looking for this type of pan for quite awhile. Pan is worth the price. I would recomened it to anyone.
5,Broiler Pan,After searching in many stores and not finding a broiler pan at all I went to AMAZON and found several options. I selected the Range Kleen Broiler pan after reading about the product and the reviews. Once it was ordered it came quickly and I was very pleased with the product. It cleans easily and performs up to my expectations.
4,"Nonstick, easy to clean? Not really, but there is hope ...","I bought these pans (large and small) to replace my hunk o' junk Nordic Ware broiler. Like many of the other reviews that state this pan is not nonstick or easy to clean, I have had the same issues. It will work OK the first few uses, and then what won't come off of it will start to build up! The pan had a layer of ""stuff"" that simply would not come off, particularly baked on PAM spray. I finally gave up my many attempts at trying to clean it with everything under the sun including a Brillo pad and said to my husband, ""Here, you try cleaning this"". Smarty pants broke out the Simple Green and some elbow grease and 20 minutes later it was clean!! So I did not waste $50+! They pans work really great, and I especially like that the top drains off the fat. I do suggest that you get the pan in the sink to soak and clean as soon as possible to reduce how often you need to break out the elbow grease later."
2,Weird lower pan!!,"I couldn't tell this from the photos- the lower pan has a hole in it! This is not a problem when you're using the top and bottom pan together, but you can't use just the bottom pan to place a roast in."
1,item not received,"i was excited to order the item, however, i received notification that the package was lost and the item was never delivered to me. very disappointing."
2,"OK, not great","i did NOT find this pan particularly easy to clean. also, with scrubbing, the enamel finish comes off in small places."
2,Hard to Clean!,"I had high expectations for this broiler pan as I did not want to use a traditional non-stick pan. It has been extremely disappointing as from the first time it was used, the grease that splattered and baked onto the surface proved to be almost impossible to remove. We tried to handwash it, wash it in the dishwasher, and scrub it with several types of abrasives. None of the methods have completely cleaned it satisfactorily. I would be quite wary of purchasing other porcelain-finish pans now."
3,Not Dishwasher Safe,"I've only owned the product for a few weeks now, but upon receiving it, I decided to put it in the dishwasher. Bad idea. Although the description says that is is dishwasher safe, it came out with missing portions of the porcelain. I suspect that the inside metal heated up in the dishwasher, causing certain areas of the pan to expand. It's only in certain areas like the corners, and I'm going to keep it. However, be very careful when cleaning this pan using a dishwasher. Other than that, it's a grill pan and the perfect size for grilling Asparagus (which was my main intention whey buying this)."
3,It serves the purpose but could be better quality,I bought the pan for its size. I needed a smaller broiler pan with just enough surface cooking space for two people and the size is perfect. The edges of the grill pan are a bit sharp so you have to be careful when washing the pan. I think they could have either powder coated the edges a bit more or made the grill pan a bit thicker so the edges would not be so blade-like.
4,Inexpensive pan,"This is your basic inexpensive broiler pan. It does what it's supposed to, but I would expect it to last forever. The finish is nonstick enough, but seems like it will warp and maybe rust after a lot of use, but we will see how it holds up."
2,mindless violence without a story,"Not having watched the Peter Davison Doctor Who for 15 years, I decided to purchase Caves of Androzani since it was considered by many to be a good story. One of the best things about Doctor Who are the interesting characters and interactions. However, this story does not have much character development. Every character is totally hostile and uncaring. Most of the story is about the Doctor and Peri being captured, chased, and tied up. The main villian is uninteresting and the other characters nameless. Not only do they hate the doctor, they fight and betray each other to the point of being ridiculous. People die pointlessly in almost every scene. Skip this one."
2,Bafflingly overrated,"I have no clue why 'Caves of Androzani' is such a beloved episode. I just watched the DVD to refresh my memory and it was just as I recalled when I first saw it, a pointless story with very little interest, endless running around, terrible effects and sets (although the exteriors are nice) and the patently annoying Peri sidekick, with whom the villain inexplicably falls in love.The most aggravating thing for me about the story is that the Doctor just 'happens' into it and is basically always on the run, being wrongfully accused, getting poisoned. Obvious holes like 'why is he there in the first place' get glossed over and everyone dies in the end anyway. Even the ... man-in-a-dragon-suit-monster.The DVD is nicely put together, if for some strange reason you do actually like this episode. Beautiful menus, lots of extra materials, and great clean images."
1,utterly pathetic,"Unlike others who have reviewed this story, I find the Caves of Androzani to be the absolute worst Dr. Who I have ever seen. The masked villian is soooo boring and unrealistic, it almost makes me gag. I have enjoyed every Dr. Who episode I have seen up until this one. I'm really suprised because the regeneration stories are often the most interesting. I think my main gripe is with Peri. I think this story would have been much better if it had been companionless. She whines way too much in this one. Hopefully this one will grow on me in time. I suppose anything is possible."
4,Not the best episode maade by this doctor but a very good one all the same. intoroduces Colin Baker in the end.,"The hunt for gun runners traps the Doctor and Peri in it's trap by mistake and then they find they have been posioned by the very drug everyone is after. The Doctor is able to save Peri but not himself as we meet the next Doctor in Collin Baker. Not his best show, but a very good show over all. fine performances pull out a poor script and weak sets and save the show overall from the period doldrums."
4,The Whats of Where?,"Okay, first of all, I'd better start off by saying that no die-hard science fiction fan is going to mark this review ""helpful"". In fact, I suggest those of you who fall under that category stop reading this right now.I am not and have never been a big sci-fi fan, but I have always been an almost ridiculously devoted fan of Peter Davison (ever since first seeing him in All Creatures Great & Small when I was six years old). As a result, I have no idea what was actually going on in this story, I just know that I loved watching him in it. I enjoyed watching Nicola Bryant (Peri) as well, though she didn't have a very good hold on her American accent!To sum up: this would be an excellent buy for any sci-fi or Dr. Who fan - or those of you who are like me, and would gladly watch a DVD of Peter Davison staring at a blank wall. (With audio commentary, perhaps?) :-)"
4,A distinct sound you may or may not like,"Based mostly on the two glowing reviews here, I took a shot on these Dean Markley strings despite my general loyalty to Ernie Ball. One word: TWANG. These strings have a bright tone and unmistakable twang to them. I wasn't too surprised when I learned recently that the Dead Milkmen's Dave Blood used to use these strings (the bright, twangy sound is audible on many of their songs-- ""I am the Walrus"" off the Bucky Fellini album is a notable example). I can see how this sound might work for some people's music, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for, as I wanted a mellower, less piercing sound. That said, they are clearly high quality strings, and I would recommend them for anyone looking for that distinctive sound."
2,"""You're trapped in a temporal paradox!""","Incerdibly overrated. The obligatory inclusion of the Daleks totally ruin one the first Who stories that takes advatage of temporal theory itself. It's not a bad UNIT story and all around are very good. it's just the staging, dialogue, voices and realisation of the Daleks in this serial that fail. It can still be more tolerable than a Pertwee 6-parter..."
3,an eye sore and a bore to boot.,"Like a lot of the 1972 pertwee stuff this was flat and had a lot of extra scenes of running around and Pertwee action which was lame and snoozer boring. The Three-wheeler(3-wheeled motorcycle called a ""rover"" in Europe I think) was not a novel Idea and not inovative or high tech with the added sound effects(a mini moog or some such.) Yet you see it a lot and Pertwee and Manning straddled to it(Mister Rogers Nieghborhood style nudge nudge) the running around and dodging bullets gets boring after the first few episodes. Personally I liked the first Pertwee season(1970) 71 being second on my list for quality. The others were just filler crap. But if you like the James Bond style DW it is better than the current excuse for Who???"
3,INTELLIGENT PREMISE,"Although somewhat dissapointing in the realization of the Daleks, this is a very intelligent story on the paradox of time travel and changing history. On the positive side, apart from the story, you have Jon Pertwee, Ogrons (my favorite baddies, I don't know why), the Brigadier, and that wonderful 70's sci-fi electronic music (really sets the mood). On the negative side, you have a bit of overacting (the Controller comes to mind), minimal sets, and of course the minimal involvement of the Daleks. As others have noted, this is not the best Dalek story or Pertwee's strongest episode, but it is still enjoyable nonetheless, with some genuinely scary moments to boot."
4,Not traditional Dalek story but still very great!,"Very good time-travel story full of suspense! I don't want to give anything away so I won't say anything about the plot! Acting is great, costumes the same, plot, excelent. Full of action and, as stated above, great suspense! Final episode the best when it is all explained! It is tremendous! A must-buy for Whovians no matter which doctor is your favorite! Worth every cent you spend on it!"
3,I thought Daleks were meant to add to a Dr Who story.,"A group of mercenaries from the future have travelled back to the 20th century in order to kill the man they think responsible for starting the third world war which left the world in a mess. Though this is an enjoyable and well-written story, the Daleks just seem to have been thrown in for the sake of it and their presence drags the overall story down as opposed to enhancing it. The Ogrons are good, however, and with their humanoid proportions they look more of a real threat than the shambling rubber creations which all too often ruin good stories. The fact that you can see the actors' eyes also helps, as the expressions in them are more real. The story is also bogged down a bit by deadweight companion Jo Grant (I've always been baffled as to why so many Dr Who companions wear short skirts and high-heels even after falling over a lot due to them in previous adventures). A good story, but could have done without the Daleks this time."
2,"""'Boney,' I said, 'an army marches on its stomach.'""","An incredibly ambitious and overrated story that suffers from the inclusion of the Daleks themselves. Had the Daleks NOT been included, and the production team just invented a new alien/monster and/or villian, it might have been more of a success. The main cast is just fine, with a little UNIT humor thrown in for good measure, ""Rank has its priveledges..."" The Controller isn't too bad, but why does he and his girl assistants have an unhuman glow on their faces? Certainly can't be from stress. And then the Daleks. These Daleks are probably the worst in the entire series, with the most aggravating voices, the silliest staging, and the most pathetic line of formation when they attack Aubrey House. Believe it or not, the Ogrons are better realised in this story than the Daleks. Incredibly disappointing, though it's not without merit, ""The Day of the Daleks"" is only infamous for nostalgiac reasons."
3,only 1 out of 3 rings,"On the strength of the other reviews I decided to pick this up. But I found it to be a fairly dissatisfying. Inside were page after page of women who look like over the hill exotic dancers. Heavily made up & dispassionate faces peer out at you. Some of the clothes were fairly interesting, but not enough to make up for the rest."
3,"Not Really a ""Lust Circus,"" but still pretty good","Goth Girls, Leather Boys, Doms and more. . .Though in my opinion alot of the photos are fairly blan, there are indeed some that a worth while. Most of the photos seem to be snapshot style scene photos and others are simply portrait style fetish shots."
4,Literature to get lit by.,"Man I od'd on baseball quite a while back but the ""All That Good Stuff"" story is as funny a sports piece as I've ever read. Worth the price of the book alone. Has at least a half dozen laugh out loud lines describing the characters' actions/traits. Get it."
2,High expectations.,"The story ""What Salmon Know"" is outstanding and should be read first to set the standard for the remaining tales which I was disappointed with. The author's below-blue-collar characters need some further depth before they can emerge from a flat universe into something more 3-D. The gravitation to stereotype personas gave me concerns that the author was trying too hard and by doing so was attempting to convince his characters that indeed, redemption from their unenlightened lives is impossible. The Salmon story is another matter and rises to high art and deep thought...worth the cost of the book dispite my constant question with his other stories: ""where's he going with this and why?"""
4,Randolph Scott movies,"Easy to watch, uncomplicated storylines, no extreme violence. Good evening viewing that won't keep you wound up before going to bed!"
5,TRIPLE RANDOLPH SCOTT DVD,Great quality to be remade old movies. I purchased as a gift for my mom for Christmas and one for her birthday. She loves it. Will probably order additional Randolph Scott dvds.
4,"ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 21","RIDING SHOTGUNAnother very interesting André de Toth western that shows us why the Hungarian born director should be praised as much as John Ford, Howard Hawks or Raoul Walsh. RIDING SHOTGUN is not about the revenge of a man whose sister was killed by a bad guy, it's about the study of the behaviour of the population of a little town, a theme De Toth will also handle inThe Bounty HunterandThe Indian Fighter. Highly recommended."
4,Great old fashioned westerns!,"Bought for my Mother in Law who loves John Wayne and Walker, Texas Ranger. We all enjoyed the movies in this one. The scenery was wonderful, the plots strong, and actors well into the top of their careers."
2,Triple feature Randolph Scott,"I gave this 2 stars because one of the films will not load on the dvd player. The other two films are good. These are older movies, but I enjoy watching the older movies,especially westerns."
5,excellent,Everything about order excellent. Time getting to New Zealand amazed me. Keep up the good work
1,Poor performance,"By accident I ordered two maps. When I realized my error, I called customer service. I cancelled the Amazon order. I received $4.97 out of a original charge of approximately $13.94. I wish that the operator in customer service had told me to cancel the less expensive charge."
5,Marvin Gaye,"I had seen a clip of Marvin Gaye on youtube but it was too short and it didn't give much information about his background. I searched Amazon and saw Final 24: His Final Hours and thought this would be interesting so, I purchased it."
1,Horrible DVD!!,"This is not a cheap representation of Marvin's life by very poor actors with a very poor script, horrible sets, and horrible photograpy. Very disappointing and a complete waste of money, don't waste your time with this."
4,Very good resource,"This is the book that sparked my interest in WW1 uniforms. This is a fantastic resource for people interested in what the uniforms really looked like, and how they were worn. The use of in-depth descriptions of the various pieces of equipment is a method that all uniform books should copy. As with many others, I wish that they had shown Ottoman or more Austrian and Commonwealth uniforms. However, this is another great edition from a fantastic series.If any publishers are reading this, PLEASE produce more books about WW1 uniforms. This is a sadly underrepresented topic."
3,Decepo,"O livro apresenta excelentes fotos coloridas de modelos vivos, com certeza é uma boa fonte de pesquisa sobre a primeira guerra mundial, entretanto é decepcionante observar, que no há nenhuma foto dos uniformes Austro-Húngaros(agosto de l914), Otomanos, Romenos, Búlgaros etc. Com certeza com fotos desses uniformes o livro mereceria cinco estrelas."
3,Density of the Daleks,"A poor sequel to the best Dalek story of all, Genesis of the Daleks. The Daleks and Movellans race to Skaros to find Davros, creator of the Daleks. The idea being that they hope he will be able to end the stalemate in their logical war. The concept is great, but the execution leaves a little to be desired. Writer Terry Nation and Story Editor Douglas Adams do not make a great combination. The story has some good moments and the introduction of Lalla Ward as the newly regenerated Romana is handled well. Overall, this is certainly a better story than some of the Patrick Troughtan and Jon Pertwee Dalek episodes. It also sets the stage for Davros' saga, continued in Revelation, Remembrance and Ressurection of the Daleks."
3,Very original and entertaining Dalek story,"The Doctor and his newly regenerated companion Romana have landed on the planet Skaro and get caught in the crossfire of a battle between the Daleks and a race of robots called the Movellans. Written by the Dalek's creator Terry Nation, and The Doctor being played by the talented Tom Baker makes this one of the best Dalek episodes ever. It contains a reasonable amount of action and has a very creative plot. The Daleks look very old and weatherbeaten, and the Davros costume has seen better years, but this doesn't let the story down too much and most Doctor Who fans should ignore this downfall."
4,Hitch Hiker' Guide to Daleks,"If you listen to most Dr Who fans, this is the least liked Dalek story of them all. Tom Baker is over the top, they will say, the Daleks look battered and worn, Davros is a bit of a joke ... Don't listen to them. This is great fun. It is also an example of Dr Who at the peak of its power. When first aired by the BBC in 1979, it drew over 13 million viewers (a substantial amount in the UK). The script editor of Dr Who at the time was Douglas Adams, who went on to become famous for 'itchiker's Guide to the Galaxy' and it shows; the script is quite lighthearted in places, but rather than detract from the eeriness of the story, this approach only enhances it. Of course, it would be easy to poke fun at the occasional dodgy special effect and the odd lacklustre performance. But it has always been the conviction on behalf of the production team and actors that makes this show great fun. And great fun is surely something we could all do with a lot more of."
3,Stalemate!,"""Destiny"" may not be the best ""Who"" or ""Dalek"" adventure, but to really enjoy it, one must understand who the script editor was at this time: Douglas Adams. ""Hitchhiker"" in-jokes a-plenty! The Daleks themselves aren't that bad, Romana's regenration doesn't have a lot of emphasis on the story(which partly good), and the Movellans are one of the most ridiculous looking humanoid robots. Production values during this season are surely not on the spectacular side( Davros' mouth, the special effects, ect.), but to fully appreciate this story and the rest of the seventeenth season, you have to remember who the script editor was at the time!"
1,"Bad story from a bad season,","Another horrible installment from the horrible season 17 which only contained one good (albeit very good) storyDoctor Who - City of Death (Episode 105). The other 4, including this one, were cheap (even by Doctor Who standards) poorly written and executed which caused a bored Tom Baker to let loose his worst over-the-top ad-libbing tendencies, just compounding the badness. If you are not familiar with this low-point in the T. Baker era, stay far away otherwise you will curse yourself for flushing your hard-earned money.Tom Baker's tenure also produced the best Doctor Who ever made so seek out stuff from 74-77 first.'Destiny of the Daleks' is one of the worst Dalek stories but Tom Baker also starred in the all-time classic Dalek storyDoctor Who - Genesis of the Daleks (Episode 78). If you don't have that one, get it!"
5,Batteries????,"I have had GREAT LUCK with the Energizer e2 LITHIUM AA's. They cost around 12$ for 8, but I went through 600 pictures w/flash and they are still going. I have heard many people complain that the Fuji S7000 draws batteries, and these are great!!!.. Rechargables dont even come close!!!"
2,Takes pictures too slow- Poor customer service,"I got this camera to take pictures of school events. The quality of outdoors posed pictures are great, but it takes pictures TOO slow. I have not seen this problem anywhere on the web, so I sent it back. Fuji told me the camera was fine. I have since had a professional take a look at it and they think I got a lemon. Other problems include: the camera turns itself off in the middle of shooting lots of pictures (power saver is turned off), and images appear blurry in the view finder (but appear ok when I take the picture). Good luck on finding one that works, because the company will not take care of you. I gave it a 2 star because of the customer support."
4,Very good Camera,i've had a 1.3mp olympus digital for some time now and went to this camera.If you're into the basics of photos (point and shoot)This camera has that with very good results.If you think that 6mp is over kill. Think of your last vacation photos can you really blow that up.Now ever wonder what your shot could have been like if you could just change something to make the pic look just the way you want.Welcome to moreand enjoypsbuy Rechargeables
4,XLNT CAMERA,"This is my third S7000. Not because the other two quit, but both were stolen. After trying smaller Kodak and Vivitar cameras, I had to go back to the Fuji. Although no longer produced, this camera fits so well in the hand, and the controls are so easy to manipulate I found myself scouring the internet for used ones. The versatility of this camera, the quality of the pictures and videos and the design are some of the most comfortable features in a camera I've encountered in my 50 years of amateur photography. Some say the batteries drain quickly but I have found that using a high quality rechargeable makes that problem minimal. And a 1gb XD card can store so darn many pics you could shoot for days. Fuji did a phenominal job on the model and I hope to use my third Fuji S7000 for many years."
2,IF you buy the Fuji S7000 YOU'LL BE SOORRREEEE!,"I have a Fuji S5000 and thought it a good camera for the price. It takes sharp photos with great color under all conditions. I wanted to go to a 6MP camera and for the price the Fuji S7000 looked like a great deal. Boy was I wrong. My S5000 3MP takes better pictures than the S7000. The camera would not focus for anything. The indoor shots were horribly Under exposed and constantly fuzzy, even with the setting on sharp. The color was dull and the auto focus just does not work well in low light conditions (by low light I mean indoors where people like to shoot photos of their family). If your on a budget try the S5000 I think you'll be happy. If you can afford to go to the $1,000.00 range go with the Canon EOS. Or the new Sony 8MP camera. IF you buy the Fuji S7000 YOU'LL BE SOORRREEEE!"
5,No battery drain,"I haven't seen any battery drain with the FinePix S7000 and use a CompactFlash card to store the images.Also when it arrived it was factory set at 1 Megapixel so you need to push the f button and change the quality setting to a higher level [I keep mine set at 6 Megapixel].At that setting it is very high resolution, I use images I take and use them as a background for my desktop PC and the colors are excellent.Overall a great camera, also the video setting works great, it has two settings, at 640 it lasts 1m48s and at 320 it lasts 3m34s with a 128 MB CompactFlash card.Also at 6MP it holds 83 frames with regular snapshots, and at 3MP it holds 164 frames on a 128 MB CompactFlash card."
5,Very Nice,"Okay I'll be honest. I am a complete amateur(for the moment) when it comes to cameras and all the jargon that is associated with them, but I must say that this baby does a really nice job of what it is supposed to do and that is to take good,high quality pictures. Tinkering around with the buttons for an hour or so will give you a general idea of what this camera is capable of. The only problem that I did face was that the memory card supplied with the camera is woefully inadequate for the kind of images that you would like to take with a camera of this calibre. All in all I am extremely pleased with my purchase."

5,dr who,i use to love to watch dr who but offten as not i wond up missing some odd episodes so now i watch the dr who and know that ive watched every episode of them all
3,They've done better,"This was not as good as the Keys of Marinus (Story 5), but wasn't horrible. Includes episodes 27-30 of season one."
4,An excellent episode,"More than one school in Britain based it's history lessons on the historical episodes of Dr Who, so accurate were the costumes and characters. This episode is no exception, with a very vivid and accurate portrayal of Aztec life woven into this excellent piece of drama. Yes, there are some bloopers in this story, but they are barely noticable. An excellent story, all round."
5,"Great Doctor Who DVD, a ""Must Have""","""The Aztecs"" is considered by many to be the First Doctor's finest episode. Having seen it many years ago on public TV, at the time I thought it a bit dull. But I have I to report that this DVD is one of the best Who discs to date.First off, using some fancy new restoration program, the Aztecs now looks as it was originally transmitted all those years ago. Suddenly, the whole thing comes to life. Now I love the story. You can appreciate the actor's performances so much better. The story of the restoration is one of the documentaries on the DVD.There are also a ton of extras including interviews with the actors who portrayed the Aztecs and the set designer.This is a ""Must Have"" for any Who enthusiast. I hope they give the same treatment to ""An Unearthly Child"" some day."
4,Not the best WHO-story but no less worth checking out,"There are better early Dr Who stories than this available. But as this is one of the earliest starring all original companions (Ian, Barbara and Susan) it's definitely interesting and some of the guest cast is great (especially John Ringham as the evil Tlotoxl)."
5,Power 2000 RTC-148 Charger for Kodak KLIC-8000,"Well worth the money! It charges the battery just fine and costs a lot less than the name brands. What's in the package: UNIVERSAL Base has 1 input: 12V(DC) 2nd AC wall 120 to 250VAC : It comes with a 12V car charger, 120VAC (anywhere) wall outlet and the adaptor for the 240 VAC European wall outlet connections. Two LED indicators ""Charge"" and ""Status"". (for others with knowledge of output:4.2V @800mA and 8.4V @800mA capable)"
1,does not do what it says,"I ordered this charger because my camera came with an original kodak KLIC-8000 battery, however it does not charge the KODAK BRAND battery, but is does charge the knock off. Therefore, I am still left with a battery that I cannot charge with out paying the high price for a kodak brand charger."
1,Missing parts.,This charger did not come with an American AC plug-in. It ruined my vacation.What is the point of having a Euro adapter with nothing to adapt.This company should check their stock more carefully.
1,It doesnt work,"It's inexpensive and has a lot of adapters, but what good is it if it doesn't charge? I purchased the charger with a brand new KLIC 8000 battery for my new Kodak. I put the battery in to be charged and a red light comes on and the green will come on within 30 minutes or so and if I'm lucky I will get 15 mins of battery time. Last night I left it to charge all night and all day knowing I needed to use it when I got home. Well I got about 6 pictures before the camera shut down again and so I'm left waiting for another green light to get maybe another picture or 2. So in the end I'm going to end paying for the more expensive charger that I should have purchased in the first place because I NEED IT TO WORK!! You get what you pay for."
1,Very unsatified,"Receiving not notices as to the order's progress and waiting a week, I decided to call the company, Adorama Camera Inc. They were very sorry but the item had not been sent but they would do so immediately. After another week an email informed me that the item could not be sent and that I was getting a refund. I guess I should be happy that the refund went through with no problem."
4,Lots of charging options,"I bought this as a gift, so I can't speak for how well it works. Assuming it actually charges a battery, this is a pretty good option to use. It can be used to charge the camera battery in a wall socket, a car, and it even has an adapter for outside of the U.S. outlets. This makes it convenient to consume energy anywhere in the world."
3,An ok charger,"It works well, but is unnecesarily big. It is also somewhat noisy if it is connected but the battery isn't placed (You can hear a little ""fizzzzzzzzzz"")."
1,Wouldn't know if it works...,"I used this ONCE. It did charge the battery (and I do have the Kodak one), but when I went to unplug the charger from the wall it fell apart in my hand. Cheapest made thing I've ever seen. I hardly think pulling something from an outlet in the wall should cause it to break right in half. All the inside wiring was exposed and puled apart with the casing. Waste of money. If you buy one be VERY careful when you unplug it."
1,It is just a battery charger...,"It is a battery charger that charges the rechargeable battery I bought for my camera. The only really cool things are it came with an adapter for overseas and a car charger, both of which I have yet to try.///That was back in 2010 and well now I have since tried to use the car charger which didn't work because it doesn't fit the camera at all. At this point I doubt the adapter works either but I still have yet the opportunity to use it."
1,Travel Book? What A Joke!!!!!,"Because of making a quick decision to travel to Papua New Guinea, I ordered the Lonely Planet Papua New Guinea Book from you and payed to have it ovenighted.Although I wasn't leaving until 5 days later, the book never arrived.Upon returning from the trip, I found the book had arrived while I was gone. Although asking for overnight shipping, it had been shipped 4 days after the order date,and by ground. But the best part of it was that the book was the 1993 version!!!! An information travel book 17 years old! I don't know if I should call it a joke or just the total rip off that it is.Will I use your services again? I'm not so stupid!Anthony FalconeKey West, Florida"
3,I Tried...,"I tried liking this album but it doesn't get me. It reminded me too much of Palace (Will Oldham) in the way of singing, themes and guitarplaying. Only addition is a nice female voice.It may be a special way of recording for some (This happened a lot about a decade ago btw) but I don't think I will play this CD a lot. The songs are long and all of them in the same tempo as well."
5,Utterly brilliant,"I got this on cd right when it came out but it was so good that i had to get it on vinyl. I can't say enough about it (other than i wouldn't really call it goth pop by any means.)Every album of Jason's is different and if you're familiar with his work, then you should enjoy this immensely. People who claim ghost tropic as his masterpiece are gravely mistaken. This entire album,especially the last four songs, is unbelievable. Get it NOW..."
4,Well used!,"We have two ~75lb Boxers who enjoy lounging on the Coleman Pet Bone Lounger. I ordered the large size so they had room to spread out while lounging. We covered it with an old comforter to add a little cushion & to make it easier to keep clean. One of our Boxers has pretty much claimed it as his & really doesn't like to share it with the other.While it is really easy to set up, move, take down, etc. it's not very tall when it's set up. The height plus the weight of a Boxer means the Lounger doesn't allow the dog to be completely suspended from the floor. Unfortunately it's usually their rear hips that rest on the floor when they curl up in the middle of the lounger, but overall it's a great product."
2,Greek Small Dictionary,"The fonts are hard to read. Courier New Greek would have been a better choice. I do not know why editors who know nothing about thelanguage involved choose the fonts they do for foreign languagedictionaries. A lot of common Demotic words simply are not there. This dictionary is a better than nothing dictionary,but I would keep looking if you want something easily readable....The other thing is this dictionary contains noconjugations and no aorist stem roots. It is bare bones.Jorge en Jalisco"
3,Did not fulfill my need,"I was actually looking for a Greek/English dictionary to help me with some words and phrases that are used in ""Corelli's Mandolin."" This dictionary is very complete but not helpful for me and my needs. Still looking for a Greek/English book that will help me understand those mystery bits."
2,Not a great resource,"The Langenscheidt Greek Dictionary is NOT the dictionary you'll want if you plan to use your Greek dictionary with any frequency. The entries are crammed together and hard to read, the print quality is poor, example of word usage are almost completely lacking, and compared to other dictionary available, it has far fewer entries. It's cheap, which is a selling point I suppose, but if you can spare the change you should go for the Liddell & Scott Dictionary instead, it's a much better deal."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"Of all the books that I have read, this one made the picture of me, a little more clearer. I believe that Eve Ensler is a magnificient author, despite what others think, and needs to be praised for what she has written in these 118 pages. I feel free now, and have a since of understanding. No other book has touched me like this one. It made me laugh, made me cry, and above all made me see. I would recommend this book to anyone, male or female."
4,Makes me proud to be a woman,"I read The Vagina Monologues based on the recommendation of two of my friends. They had both read it and said it was a book worth reading. I agree. I started it and finished it within a weekend. The Vagina Monologues deals with how society treats the topic of womens sexuality. It was gripping in the various descriptions of how women saw it: ""down there"", ""coochie snorcher"", ""Itsy bitsy"". Eve Ensler has done a remarkable job of putting together a book that deals with a subject that is considered taboo in most of our society. Many people would be embarressed to read this book, but it should be read. It promotes a feeling of satisfaction that I am a woman. Her description of childbirth, of how a young woman reacted after being raped, these are just but two of the highlights of this book.The letters from women and men who had been to the performances, or who were putting on the performances for V-day were also insightful. Many thanks to Eve Ensler for such a good book."
3,Mixed feelings,The first half was much much better than the second half. It was an okay read but certainly not mind blowing or life changing. Not worth the money spent. But...the awareness that V-Day provides for women is priceless.
3,Yes and No,"I would definitely recommend this book to everyone! the monologues are great and entertaining. I gave it a rating of three stars because I felt the book kind of short. I thought it would be longer...Also, because I was mainly interested in reading the monologues not so much the other stuff included in the book such as notes from the author and stuff like that. Over all it was good though"
4,vagina monologues,"I enjoyed the book. It is very funny and sincere. I have always wanted to attend the vagina monologues but I've never had the chance to go, but at least I have read them and hope to soon see them performed."
5,A Triumph,"The Vagina Monologues is a wonder to read, fascinating in its intricacies of the female body and its connection to the psyche. It brought me toward comfort with my own body, and opened my mind to the issues of feminism and female empowerment. The play is not at all pornographic, but sensual and poignant in its heartbreak and its uplifting joy. Now I must see it performed, as that is bound to be ten times more powerful!Other favorite plays that deal with feminist issues include (but of course are nowhere near limited to) Masterpieces by Sarah Daniels, and Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off by Liz Lochead."
1,An absurd jaunt into the land of feminism,"Is it possible for someone to write something absurd, give it a ridiculous title, and keep such a straight face about it that people actually take the book seriously? I think so. This book is living proof of it."
1,Not Enough Vaginas!,"They could have crammed alot more vagina in there. If they title something vagina monolgues it ought to be all about vagina. I don't want to hear alot of whining about Bosnia and the Salem Witch Trials. Give me vagina, vagina and more vagina."
1,The V-Day Edition,"I don't know why you put this on my page...I would like it off my page. I find it disgusting and vile. Also, as far as rating this trash....it should be --------------------"
3,Needs more depth,There were a couple interesting stories but I really think I expected much more and much more depth out of the book than I got especially based on some of the reviews that I read. (guessed I should have read some of the bad ones first cause I agree with some of them). I am actually a bit generous in giving 3 stars because some parts were actually so boring I just skimmed through those parts.
5,Astonishingly frank!,"Eve Ensler has written an astonishingly frank, but oh so true series of short essays. This was enlightening on so many levels. I actually was a member of a cast who did this as performance shortly after I got the script, and the humor as well as the pathos was impressive."
3,not quite what I had expected,"I was somewhat dissapointed in this book. I had heard nothing but great reviews of both the book and the performances. But when I finished the book, I found myself very dissapointed. I didn't really laugh. I didn't really cry. It was decent, and perhaps there are women out there who *needed* to read it, but I just didn't find it as inspiring and wonderful as so many others have."
5,Words cannot express...,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Eve Ensler for her work. This book changed my perspective on my body and those of women around the world forever. Finally we have found a sane voice among all the myths, fears, and secrecy. I have given this book to many of my friends, male and female. Keep passing the word on, and on and on..."
5,WHO KNEW VAGINAS WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE?,"Three years ago a friend of my took me to see Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues. I didn't know what to expect -- it could be anything from serious feminist performance art to stand-up judging from the title. But Ms. Ensler's incisive words and brilliant message have forever changed the way I think, feel and relate to my body and my feminity. These are not just words on a page, they are an experience."
1,Banality into oblivion,"""Quem deus vult perdere, prius dementat"" Euripides - a person without the vagina.For those sane women who threw this obsenity down before the end, don't let it bother you. When the disgusted leave only the disgusting remains."
1,Not true liberation.,"I personally think that there is a little more to me than my sexual organs. I enjoy my body and my husband enjoys my body as a gift from God in our private relationship together. In my opinion, those who have to scream out loud about it in the vulgarest terms possible aren't in healthy and satisfying relationships. Lesbian relationships involving little girls certainly aren't healthy or good (make that 24 year old a man and see what you think then) and while it is important to protest the abuse of women in war situations, don't bring that into your life with all the fear and mistrust women like Eve Ensler want to promote against good, loving men. You'll end up alone realizing that a sex toy or your fingers (or another woman) is not very fulfilling, not only in a sexual sense but in terms of what you get emotionally and spiritually in a relationship that deals with you as a whole person."
1,"To be honest, it deserves 0 stars","I was studying at chapters this weekend when someone suggested this book to me. I've been looking for something decent to read...I was beyond disapointed. I found this book to be sick, disturbing and just plain gross. I consider myself to be a open minded woman, but this book just rubbed me the wrong way. I put the book down when she wrote about asking little girls what they think of their vagina's, and went no further.Perhaps Ms. Ensler would say that someone like me has a hard time exploring my sexually. Far from it. I just feel some things are meant to be private. I feel she went too far with this. I was able to get my money back thank God."
1,Trash,"If one enjoys depravity, vulgarity, lewdness and shameful text, then one may enjoy this book. It is senseless, unnecessary, and exists merely to sensationalize its perversity."
1,Vagina Monologues,A bunch of women who have never been curious or free enough to check out their own bodies get together and share their limited views of themselves and the world.
1,repulsive,"This is an utterly crude monologue. I have seen it performed, read it, and am now writing a rhetorical criticism of it. It is a complete refutation of all that is or every was traditional and modest. It represents liberal progressivism at its worst... societal decay. Some may call it liberating, I find it crude and completely inappropriate for any audience. I only study it so I am better equipped to rebute its content. Completely vulgar; I am disgusted by it."
1,What a load of #%@*,"The only thing perhaps more moronic than this tripe is those who have let themselves be bamboozled into thinking that there is something of deep thought and/or substance here. I can only assume that those who found this entertaining are extremely insecure and think that if they like something that others who are perceived to be ""important"" like that they too will be ""important"". The part of this I truly find mind-numbing is her ""deep"" and ""thoughtful"" insight into the solution to the violence/terrorism in the world; all we need is ""vagina warriors"" working at the ""grass-roots level"". You know what, let me reconsider my first observation; to call this moronic is an insult to morons everywhere. It's sub-moronic."
1,awfully cheesey..... don't purchase,"This is truely awful, I can't imagine this being funny to anyone under 50...... Super fake, uses stupid annoying terms such as ""coochie snorcher"" non stop. Actual interviews are better than the stupid annoying over rehearsed monologues. Did I mention ANNOYING. Total waste of money!"
5,vagina monologue,"Not all people have the same opinions or even get the same reaction when they read vagina monologue, but thats with any book that you can actually get somthing out of. Because people are all different (no one being the same at all), we all take in different parts of this book and react to them in our own ways. Time Magazine writes, ""Eve Ensler can soar to rebelesion heights or move us with quiet compassion. She might not save the world but what other playwrights even think of trying."" This book was a play put into a novel and i believe if you havent read it then you havent lived. What's it going to hurt if you read it, you dont get anything out of it, well how are you going to know how you feel about the book if you dont...read it!"
5,I had no idea how much I'd like this book,"I received ""The Vagina Monologues"" as an early Christmas present this year, and I finished it in one quick sitting. While I wouldn't consider myself a ""feminist"" in the strictest sense of the word -- rather an enlightened, liberal woman -- this book forced me to realize how much women are NOT talking about important issues. There was nothing shocking or revolting about this book, as the average person might predict from the title. Rather, I was moved by each chapter, as women of all ages and backgrounds shared their memories, fears and celebrations of the one thing that makes them the most feminine. I plan to give this book to all my girlfriends; it is definitely a work everyone should read. I would like for my husband to read this as well - while he is a sensitive and intelligent man, this book could certainly teach him a thing or two about the female experience."
3,Slight Words,This is a book about women discovering themselves. Unfortunately the ambition of the project is not realized with the superficial stream of consciousness approach used. This may have been effective as a device in the play from which the book is derived but not here. The predicably trite forward by Gloria Steinem is out of place in this book and hinders its aim. Steinem only describes women in contrast to men not as ends in themselves.
3,good book but,"There IS a place for this book, for the usual feminist political reasons, as there are still too many women languishing in ignorance and fear.But I found the book to be disingenuous and self-serving at spots. For example, in the section about female circumcision in Africa the author failed to mention that it's women who do this to other women. It's old women who teach younger women to do this. Perhaps it would have been embarassing to point out that Sisterhood might not be uniform or consistent with Western preconceptions: damned if my book will sacrifice politics for facts!And it would have been interesting to include a bit of monologue about American attempts to ""educate"" women in Africa about how horrible we think their custom is, and the extent to which African women care about what American women think of them. I suppose the laughter (or confusion) of African women would have made for a rather counter-productive monologue."
2,Don't get all the praise.,"I gotta say, this book left me scratching my head because I just don't get all the fuss.If the sexual revolution had any part in your life, your going to find this book is quite pedestrian. I wasn't shocked, moved, surprised. In fact, at points, the book felt somewhat clinical.As for its off-Broadway success, I can only imagine that the production had a great director, or the Hollywood personalities who've appeared in this show are what keeps the box office busy. The writing isn't anything to write home about.If you're uptight about your sexuality and need a book to start gently rattling your gates, okay, buy this. If you have an open and comfortable attitude towards your sexuality, though, save your money. This doesn't titilate OR educate. It just leaves you flat. Save your money - I wish I had."
1,poorly written book,"i'm surprised to see no comments about the very poor quality of the writing of this book. it meanders among exposition of sexual ideas seemingly intended to shock, nonsensical lists of words, moments of serious discussion, and - this being the bulk of the book towards the end - self-congratulatory verbiage about all that the activities written about have achieved. nothing holds together. and instead of being enlightening about women's sexuality it has the character of satire and even mockery. i kick myself for wasting time and money on this book!"
4,A Rant With Solutions,"I'm no fan of James Carville.I give him credit for his writing style and wit. The book is entertaining.Carville didn't address outsourcing which was a disappointment for me.The issues that he did address he did in a no-nonsense way. And he's correct about his complaints and observations.James Carville has some great ideas on taxes, MediCare, and Social Security.Another excellent solution was offered for campaign finance reform.On tax cuts for the rich he wrote this-""In my fifty eight years on this earth, the only thing tax cuts have worked to do is get people elected who don't have a single idea in their heads."" Page 112.This book is outdated but serves well as a Progressive primer on issues that are just relevant today as when he wrote this book. It's a fast read and worth reading."
5,A Pleasureable Read,"I'm an independent that has been forced to the left due to the extremism of the Bush Administration. Bush makes Reagan look like a liberal. Anyway, I'd like to say that I read this book in five days, that is how good this book is. Carville outlines Bush's many failures and proposes alternative solutions. In the upcoming 2004 election, if Bush doesn't steal it again, I am predicting that this book will have a big impact on the Democratic party. If not, than the Democrats need to hire James Carville or buy this book."
3,Not A Good Sequel,"The last time I recall Omega appearing in an episode was 'The Three Doctors'. The first three Doctor's had to combine forces to defeat this original time lord in his anti-matter universe. At the conclusion of the episode, Omega was killed when matter and anti-matter combined causing a massive explosion (and super-nova).In this episode, we discover that Omega somehow survived the blast and is still attempting to enter the world of matter. Again he targets the Doctor for this plan.The episode itself isn't that bad except that Omega doesn't really seem to recall his last confrontation with the Doctor (the same goes in reverse for the Doctor and Omega). In my opinion, if you're going to bring back a bad guy from a previous episode, you should do a better job acknowledging it.The other weak point was how quickly the Time Lord's wanted to kill the Doctor. Seemed odd."
3,Even and old foe can't save this one,"I love Peter Davison. I think he is a fabulous actor, and a splending pick by John Nathan Turner. However, his tenure as the title character was really hurt by some shoddy writing. With the exception of episodes like Kinda and of course his last, and most brilliant episode, the writing on his stories was really subpar. This episode has many redeeming qualities, but the storyline is weak, and I expected so much more considering who the baddie is. Worth a watch for the chemistry between the characters, but there are a lot better Who episodes to chose from"
2,What a waste of a good enemy.,"Omega once again attempts to enter the universe we know with the help of the Doctor, who soon ends up being sentenced to death by the Time Lords (not for the first time in history).Bringing back old enemies isn't always a good thing, and in this case Omega is completely wasted in a story which is, to be quite honest, a nonevent. The Amsterdam location is pointless, there is endless padding (including extended scenes of the Doctor in the anti-matter universe just lying there 'wobbling', courtesy of some rather dodgy video effects). Omega himself has nothing nearing the presence he had in 'The Three Doctors' and his assistant (the obligatory monster) looks like the offspring of Godzilla and a chicken. The story's only real saving grace is the casting of Colin Baker as a superbly villainous Maxil. His appearance makes this story worthwhile as a curio for fans, but anybody looking for entertainment would be better off looking elsewhere."
3,"""Impulse Laser?!""","The Doctor's bio data extract has been stolen so that a creature which is formed of antimatter can traverse into our universe, and the Doctor must be destroyed to prevent bonding. Davison excells in ""Arc""(as does Sutton). A nice mix of contemporary Amsterdam and Gallifreyan continuity. ""Arc"" brings back Omega, trying to get back into the real Universe again, with pretty much the same result. Omega's TARDIS and the Ergon aren't that bad. Colin Baker makes a nice cameo as Maxil before he became you-know-Who, Michael Gough(pre-Batman) is great as Hedin in his second Who outing. Althoug, there doesn't seem to be that many Time Lords on Gallifrey. Lovely Amsterdam footage really helps. Davison little performance as Omega is the highlight of the story. Nice to see Tegan came back."
3,Arc of Infinity,"""Arc of Infinity"" is a Fifth Doctor story. It is the Doctor's rematch with Omega. At times, it seems that Omega had a winning hand with a secret Time Lord helping him out while the Doctor's own troubled relationship with his other fellow time lords makes it worse. Both Amsterdam and Gallifrey are settings of the intense battle between the Doctor and Omega. So please enjoy this episode."
3,Omega returns!,"Season 21 of Doctor Who offered the return of an old villian in each episode and the season premiere offered one of the best, Omega, renegade TimeLord in his continuing quest to return to normal matter space. The problem with this story is that it is extremely padded and by the time we get to the actual confrontation between the Doctor and Omega in episode four, the Doctor simply banishes him back to his anti-matter universe with some kind of cobbled up gun. The story gets points for the Amsterdam locations and future Doctor Colin Baker's portrayal of Maxil, leader of the guard on Gallifrey."
3,Decent but there's better out there.,Probably one of the better-known of the Peter Davison Who eps. but not necessarily one of the best. Omega and the plot tend to get silly after a while. END
2,Only for the die-hard fans,"As a life-long fan of Dr Who, I have to admit that some stories were worse than others. Arc of Infinity is one of those stories. The story itself makes little to no sense, although the location shots from Amsterdam are lovely. There seems to be no real reason WHY Tegan would be in Amsterdam but I was thrilled to see her return to the TARDIS Crew. I wouldn't show this to anyone who's not already a fan of the show & even then I wouldn't expect much of a reaction, beyond ""Well no wonder they cancelled this show!"""
5,Review,"Since I didn't have a model number for my vacuum cleaner, I was worried about getting a product that would not work. That did not happen. It was perfect and now I don't have to worry about replacement bags for a long, long time.The service could not be beat. I received the product within several days of placing the order. Thank you so much."
4,review of Phyllis Day's revised social work history,"Day has produced one of the best social welfare histories. It is up to date with current laws and practices. It also focuses on non-western and Third World origins of social welfare. That is a nice change from the usual focus on history. A good source for students, both graduate and undergraduate."
3,Enjoyed it except I wish it was more interesting,The book was very informative yet it was not interesting. I had to force myself to read it wasn't that bad though.
4,Fast and effective,This product was shipped fast and it arrived on time. The quality was excellent and I would do business with them in the furure
2,Social Welfare,"The best thing about this book is the cover. As a student the material is very hard to read. Very Dry. Phyllis Day does give good information but it is mostly biased. This is the first text that I have read where the Authors feelings come through strong. I know my teacher has tried other books, but always comes back to this one. I wonder about the other books."
1,Too bad,"I bought the book according to Ms. Berenbaum reputation, so the disappointment was even greater. Sure there are a lot of interesting facts but they are drowned in the middle of so much blablabla that you forget them as your frustation level increases. It looks like the author was paid by the word.... The illustrations are also a real deterrent...conclusion: I was not even able to finish the book"
5,prometheus' garden,I can't believe it took so long to release this movie! The animation is astounding- it all flows together but is completely unpredictable. It's like Bickford is tapping into a whole world the rest of us can't see.I was expecting a straight forward telling of the story of Prometheus- instead he twisted modern ideas into the landscape and created something new. It's amazing to think that animation used to be created in such an intense way- it makes it seem so much more personal.
4,Amazing Animation,"Bruce Bickford is a mad genius. This film is an excellent example of his unique clay animation work. If you are a fan of animation where everything on the screen is moving and changing you need to see this film. It's short, only 28 minutes, but packed with bizarre and surreal images; the screen is constantly alive with his morphing writhing creations. The story doesn't really make much sense, but who cares, it's amazing. There is a commentary track and some behind the scenes footage."
5,Crazy good,"Bickford's ""Premoethius"" is truly awe inspiring. Half of those I show it to can't even take its trippy quality. They say ""I am getting dizzy"". Frankly I love the immersive quality of clay, and look what Bruce has done with it. Nobody pushes the medium to this level(s!). When Bruce is gone (I hope not for a long while),"
5,Dad really liked this alot.,Got these for my Dad for Fathers day to go with his pistachios I got him either Fathers day or Christmas.
1,Sissy Fights,"First off.....they just kinda look funny in their little pro wrsetling style outfits....this makes them hard to take seriously. The crowd is also eerily quite...almost spooky in fact. You're better off spending your dosh on something else like a PRIDE ,King of the Cage or UFC event."
4,information not data,"45 years ago my teacher told me that INFORMATION is ANYTHING reducing my lack of knowledge / understanding phenomena -- my ENTROPIA. The most inportant for me 'anything' is data which I process to create and use MY INFORMATION. I do value computers as a mean to supply DATA, which I can use to crate information and use it accordingly to my needs. Excellent presentation of new society vision thanks to IT properly applied and used. I cannot aggree with some far going conclusions presented by the Author, anyway the yers old vision is pertinent and impressive, mq"
5,Engaging History,An interesting history of this famous hospital - especially in regards to the advent of ambulance services. Good read.
5,"Awesome Soundtrack! A MUST_HAVE FOR ANY ""FMA"" FAN!!","Let me tell you all: this C.D. is....cooler than cool!!!! If you're a ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" fan, you gotta get this! It has a lot of great songs! Take my advice, get this!P.S.: Most of the songs are like something from an orchestra, but three of them have lyrics. The tracks are ""Melissa"" (3rd or 4th track), ""Indelible Sin"" (last track), and the opera-sounding song (one of the last tracks)."
3,O.K.,"This was an ""o.K."" movie. It is, indeed, a ""CRASH"" wannabe. The way I rate monvies is -- if I'd watch the movie a second time, I LIKED the movie. I don't need to watch this one again. I think if I had seen ""PICO"" before seeing ""CRASH"", I might have given it a better review. The acting was GOOD, its just too close to CRASH."
1,Dont waste your money,"Hire the movie if you really want to see it, i initially thought it would be a good movie as, its similar to the movie Crash which was a great movie, but this movie just didnt do it for me. It was that boring i didnt even finish it."
4,instuction not the best,I have been doing seading beading for many years. I find the instructions not complete and confusing. I gave up on one project and am trying a second one. His work is breautiful but I want more complete instructions.
1,Nothing special,"It looks like a magazine rather than a book. Only few projects are nice but it's not worth it to pay $21 for those projects.The instructions aren't that clear and neither the graphs, I would not recommend it to anybody since there are much better books out there (e.g. The beaded garden - Diane Fitzgerald).I have seen many Russian books on beadings and there are much more interesting and worth to be translated."
5,It has everything I hoped it would have,"""I received the CD today. It has everything I hoped it would have...and more! Thank you very much."""
2,Don't buy OEM,"Battery was ordered and delivered just fine. The problem with this and other ""manufacturer equivalent"" batteries is that after one or two chargings it only holds about half its rated life or less. Don't bother trying to save money on these."
2,No buzz from this book,Alas the ideas in this book could be developed by anyone having a few minutes of quiet contemplation. Waiting for the Reader's Digest version is recommended.
3,Tried and true ...,"Tried and true solid word of mouth sales techniques supported by case studies. If you believe word of mouth is still the most effective marketing tool then this book is for you.Interesting read and easy to get through. Best suited for those new to marketing or those who need a refresher course in basic sales, marketing and public relations."
3,Material is outdated,"Great book, but even after just a few years, the material is outdated. Hardly touches the online world, which is what I was looking for."
3,"Disappointing, but could be good for the right reader.","I bought the book as a business owner that sells HR and OD consulting. I thought if I could create 'buzz' about my company, I would get more prospects interested in what I have to offer and calling me.While this may very well be true, the book didn't really offer many ideas about how to actually accomplish this in ways that I can get my hands around. I must admit this was very disappointing and at first, I was very frustrated.As I kept reading, I did find the book interesting from a academic textbook kind of way. I am very interested in marketing, although I mostly sell. Also, he seems to really disect what constitutes 'buzz' and the intangible ways in which is travels.I suggest taking a hard look at what you want to accomplish before you buy the book. Rosen obviously knows what he is talking about, but you'd better be speaking his language first."
4,Interesting & insightgul,"I read this book after reading ""Love is the Killer App"" by Tim Sanders. From the start, it's interesting & easy to read. It's full of models & charts, but they're easy to understand because the author provides ""real-life"" examples. The ""text-book"" information is easy to digest.I read this book in under a week because, quite simply, it's an interesting book. While a lot of the information pertains to computers/technology, it can be applied to any industry.The book doesn't exactly tell how to create buzz, but is, rather, an explanation of buzz so YOU can do the executing. It got me thinking ""how can I apply this knowledge to my job."""
4,The Anatomy of Buzz,"This was a pretty good book. I learned how to build ""personal networks,"" and advertise with virtually no capital at all. Most of the book is easy to understand, and Rosen really seems to know the science of social networks very well. The only thing that I did not like about The Anatomy of Buzz, was that it did not exactly illustrate how to apply ""buzz"" to your type of business. That section of the book was very vague. Overall though, it was a pretty good read."
1,This was a waste of my time,"I really didn't like this book. I've read The Tipping Point, and Crossing the Chasm (and other Moore books), all the books by Ries and Trout books, and numerous other marketing/publicity articles and publications. This ""Buzz"" book didn't offer new thinking. And the ""how"" to create buzz that other readers liked, well, I found it trite. Many of the examples used by the author are either overdone, been done before, or simply not very interesting. There were a few parts of the book that were reasonable, but all in all, it was a waste of my time and money. Normally I wouldn't even bother spending one more minute with this book by posting a review, but I am hoping that I'll save some other reader from it. Blech."
5,"Chinese Laundry Women's Buster Boot, Brownie",They delivered in less than 48 hours and were a perfect fit!
3,Battery Trouble,"I like the phone. It works great with a headset. However, we have been experiencing battery trouble and that really turns me off."
1,Wrong item,"The item shipped from ""Moontech"" and is not the slim tip listed in the description here on Amazon."
3,Not quite there yet,"This is a book which compresses a lot of good and useful information into just over 220 pages. It starts off by demonstrating how a small simple Web-based questionnaire can be rewritten as a XForms application. Unfortunately, the book is very vague on how to actually deploy XFroms applications and leaves it up to the reader to figure out how to deploy this sample application on their own system.A companion CD is provided which contains all the book sample code sources. It would have been useful and user-friendly if a copy of one of more XForms implementations were included on the CD. I hope that this is corrected in a future edition of the book.The book continues by reviewing the various XML standards used with XForms, followed by detailed chapters on XForms user interface controls, model properties, functions, actions and events.Given the current scarcity of books on XForms, this book should be on the bookshelf of any serious Web application developer."
3,Not good tutorial book,"This book highlights the XForms technology.For my opinion,it's not good tutorial materials for leaning XForms.It intends to illusrate the functionaliy of XForms rather than teaching you how to use.Be cautious, some sample codes are incorrect."
3,Needs more about applications and validation,"The book is a step up from the W3C documentation. The organization presents a nice ramp from some simple examples all the way to complex wizard style forms interfaces. You will see illustrations of the key points of the standard, but what I didn't see were examples about complex form validations or much in the way of best practices.It's tempting to base the success of a book about a standard, especially one of the first few books on a standard, on the success of the standard itself. It would be wrong to do so as the book is an individual entity that has it's own unique merits. I haven't judged the book based on the success of the standard. I have judged it on it's translate the standard and to provide perspective. It certainly translates the specification into a readable text, but it fails to provide a large perspective about how to best apply the standard in the context of a complete application."
2,This is not a cookbook,"If you are looking for the reasoning behind why XForms is built the way it is this book may be helpful.If you are looking for code examples, hints, lessons, or pointers toward how to build an XForms application you should probably look somewhere else."
4,"Onda ""grooves""","Very good CD --- cross between Yanni, Soul Ballet, and contemporary jazz. Its highlites; title cut ""Wings in the Dawn"", plus ""Zooming Clouds"" and ""From the Cape""."
2,My expectations were not met - disappointed,"As a new reader of mysteries and thrillers, I looked forward to reading this book with much anticipation. Friends had highly recommended books by Evan Hunter and Ed McBain. This combination novel (same author-different styles)was truly different. Believing that Part one was going to be the crime and Part two the solution, I was sadly mistaken. Part one has absolutely no crime or mystery. The entire section is devoted to the escapades of a sex-starved architect. We are certainly not at a loss for his lust and the author's development of his cravings. Part two at least gives us a look into the investigative work of the police trying to solve a homicide. They weave the Part one character into the story but superficially at best. The crime is easily solved without much thinking. If this book is indicitive of the styles of these two? authors, I think I'll head in a different direction."
1,Major Disappointment,"I read Evan Hunter's ""Mothers and Daughters"" when I was a child, became a fan, and have since read every book he's written as Hunter or Ed McBain. I've loved the 87th Precinct books as the characters remained consistant and the storylines good, though Hunter/McBain is unfortunately less enjoyable with each book.I still find myself somewhat excited to read each new release and Candyland was no exception. However, this book was awful! I'm as open-minded as anyone, but it seemed he used the over abundance of sex and profanity as the core of the book and the storyline as an afterthought. The ending was predictable and the characters completely boring. I had no sympathy for Benjamin Thorpe, and found myself wanting him to be killed off to add some substance to the book.This may have been my last book by Evan Hunter/Ed McBain after forty years of faithful readership."
3,Not too bad /nothing special,"Well having read the first part, I expected to find someexcitement in the second part , such as Thorpe's struggleto prove he was not the murderer, Thorpe's getting arrestedor questioned , etc. It turned out to be the fact that theguy never knew there was a crime, or that he was a suspect.Thus I sort of failed to understand why the two parts connectedto each other. The second part could have made a story without the first part. Although I like crime novels in which cops are guilty,this one is very ordinary - compared to 87th presinct. Three stars - only for the sake of McBain's writing skills."
3,Candyland,Not up to McBain/Hunter standard. I have read almost all of the Ed McBain books and I have only read a few of the Evan Hunter books. Part 1 is more about obsession than anything else. I can not believe that Ben/Michael after he got beat up and lost all his money he was still interested in obtaining the services of a hooker. Part 2 Emma and Johnny lack chemistry and would never make it at the old 87th.
2,Disappointing,"I'm a great fan of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct and Matthew Hope novels, but I really didn't enjoy this at all. I kept reading, hoping something exciting would happen but it didn't. There was too much sex and I guessed 'who dunnit' which was unusual for an Ed McBain book and really annoying.Really not worth reading."
1,Candyland,"Although not really a fan of Ed McBain I have read a few of his 87 Precinct books. I thought since this wasn't a 87th book I'd give it a try. What a boring book. The first part was enough to put me to sleep. I only finished the second part, skimming the pages, just to find out how it ended. I don't think I'll ever waste my time reading another McBain/Hunter book."
5,Candyland,"I must say how much I enjoyed this book. The first half (the Evan Hunter section) moves like a runaway train! I literally couldn't stop reading until I'd finished the whole piece in one sitting. Hunters' insight into the world of the sexually obsessed is so REAL you can feel empathy with what is really a rather loathsome persona. The McBain section is more conventional but never less than excellent. There is a palpable relaxation in pace, but this suits the unfolding nature of the plot. I've read a lot of McBain before but never dipped into his Evan Hunter books. This book has convinced me to try some."
2,A Major disappointment,"Having been away from both McBain and Hunter for a while, I thought this would be a good way to renew my reading relationship. Not exactly. Too graphic for its own good, it titilates instead of involves. Also, it should have been edited better. On several occasions it keeps referring to November 23, 1963 as the day JFK was shot. While not critical to the story, it is evidence that all involved were asleep at the switch on this one. Spend your time better elsewhere."
3,Ed McBain and Evan Hunter as the same author,"This book was a must read to anyone who knows this author under both his published names. I had to see where the two styles would meet and the book was written with Even Hunter first and Ed McBain second. I have to say that after this book I like Ed McBain as a person better than Mr. Hunter. This book was so heavily about sex and tawdry subject matter that I really could not recommend it to friends. It was difficult to finish. I look for Ed McBain and I am slowly reading all of them. I am taking my time to enjoy them for as long as I can. With titles like ""The Big Bad City"" how could you resist?"
1,.Candyland,"It is sad that Evan Hunter finally lost it when writing Candyland. What a bore. I read and enjoyed all the 87th Precinct books that are available for the Kindle, several are not."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,I tried very hard to read this turkey.......basically it amounts to pages and pages of soft core porn and Thorpe's fat ego......I could not get any further than 60 pages before BOOOOOOORRRRRRREEEEEEDDDDDOOOOMMMM began to set in.....this guy's ego knows no bounds......and the part about his little black book being so encrypted that sometimes he could not figure it out was laughable......he is God's gift to the poor women of this world who just cannot seem to get enough of him?????? and yet Hunter describes him as apparently not a head turner.... I normally enjoy mysteries and thrillers but this one had neither.....I did not get into the McBain part of the book because by page 60 I could care less what happened to Thorpe.....or anything else that pertained to this book.......it is voyeurism at its worst.....
1,Boring disappointment,"I have read with enjoyment dozens of his books, so I was shocked to find this one boring and disgusting.I don't think anyone would have published it if it were by any less well regarded author.I suppose porno could be interesting, but this one isn't."
2,Don't get too excited,"My boyfriend and I couldn't wait to use these. While the blindfold is comfortable, the cuffs don't seem to be very adjustable as my tiny wrists were able to slip right out of them. And not to mention the chain is so flimsy it broke when i pulled too hard. So folks, don't get too excited..."
3,Freaky Fun,"If you ever had one of those little fantazies. U know the one I'm talking about. It stays hidden away, cause you don't wanna talk about it. Well here you go. A neat little starter kit to see if you're really into being in the dark n chained up, lol. Nothing to be scared of here. Add other goodies to the mix here n make it an experience to remember."
5,great resource for additional study,"This guide really brings home the concepts explored in Foster's book on Disciplines. If you're interested in delving into those area in a deeper way, you'll probably enjoy this guide. It actually allows you to go through it several times (which is unusual for these types of guides), personally or in larger groups). I really appreciated it."
2,Could've been better,"I think Bizzy had no idea that this film or movie, or whatever you want to call it, was being made or released. Don't get me wrong, the songs are good, but the layout of the movie is just not worth the money. Unless you are a big time Bizzy Bone fan, this movie is not for you."
1,bad vid,Who wants to watch images of crosses zoom across the screen? What is that? Looks rank amateur. THey got inaccurate lyrics typed while dude is rapping like if you like Bizzy you dont know the lyrics. Whos great idea was it to call flesh FLESH OF BONE? whoever filmed this dont know bone or bizzy. THey look like a bunch no names hanging on dude. The extra footage is again a no name from ohio not bizzy. It goes back and forth from two shows and shows what looks like bizzy drunk doin a freestyle or dude can't rap no more.
4,"Hey, pallie, this book's a kick in the head!","Well written and informative bio of Dean Martin is hard to put down, but ultimately as confounding as its subject.Old Dino was one of the finest all-around talents we've ever had, but a mystery man to everyone. Why was this the case? How did it happen? Sadly, these questions are not answered, but, in all fairness to the author, Dean never let anyone into his confidence, sadly.Chiefly interesting for its exhaustive research of Martin's recordings, movie roles and stage appearances, but soars especially in detailing the star's glory years between 1947-1967. What a fine career indeed, too!Overall, not 100 proof successful, but 90 proof will have to do ""until the real things comes along,"" pallie."
2,Not very balanced,"Mr. Tosches does a good job painting a portrait of a man who doesn't really care about anything, who gets no enjoyment out of anything, and is generally cold and unemotional. Sounds fascinating, right? There are a few interesting sections of the book, however, its best read when balanced with books by Dean's children who offer an alternative point-of-view.My major problem with this book is that Mr. Tosches doesn't reconcile his version of Dean with the public entertainer. How can you watch or hear Dean perform and not get the sense that, although he may not have taken himself or his profession seriously, he absolutely enjoyed performing?There's no doubt Dean was a private person with his own unique faults, but as a performer no one could duplicate the infectious sense of fun he conveyed. He was one of a kind, and deserved a better biography."
3,"5 Stars for Dino, 3 for Tosches","I'm a big Dino fan, so I had to read this book. Reminds me of Leamer's ""King of the Night"" bio about Johnny Carson. Shabbily written, in a near tabloid style, and offering little insight on the subject(s). In fairness, nobody really seemed to know Martin, but Tosches seems more interested in the mob, and Dino's business dealings. You could delete about 25 pages of mob stuff, alone. Much of it is beyond the scope of Dino's life, and only distracts. Some people will be impressed by the rawness, language, and references to Italian culture. More experienced readers will wonder why Tosches wrote the book, as he clearly doesn't have a very high regard for Dino. Maybe, like Dino, he just did it for the money."
3,it's ok,"i didn't really have any interest in dean but i really enjoyed the writing in hellfire, so i picked this up. it's not bad, but it's got too many details and not enough poetry. tosches can write his ass off, but he wastes too much time listing dean's numerous contract renegotiations and hullabaloo. if you're interested in dean, you might enjoy this, but if you're reading this for classic tosches, you're best looking elsewhere."
4,Gold from Dreck,"To spin gold from such low material--the life of a minor pop figure who was huge and rich as a king in his tasteless time--shows Tosches' genius as a writer. The book is self indulgent, overwritten at times, but generally entertaining and often hilarious and brilliant. Right up there with his biography of Jerry Lee Lewis, it tells us more about what we are as Americans than most of us want to know."
2,No New Info,"As a super hard core fan of Dino's (since the age of 8)I found Mr. Tosche's biography disappointing and disturbing. The language was not necessary. We all know Dean had a passion for foul language. Frankly, after 3 personal encounters with Dino, I found he did ""give a damn"". The best thing I can say for this book is that it included many good photos of Dean, family and friends.I guess there really isn't anyone who can write a biography of Dino except his own mother, and even when alive she remained very silent. If Dino were still here, I think he would have a good laugh at all of us who tried to figure him out. Good luck to those who try to film his life. It will not give us any more insight than this book. It might give us a good soundtrack we can buy on a CD."
3,MOSTLY HEARSAY,"I have read this book and though there may be some things that have some truth to it, that would be items all of us have read about. If you are looking for something new and informative about the life of Dino, you won't find it in this book. The book Arthur Marx wrote probably is better done (leaving out the foul language) and seems to have a different viewpoint. We may never learn more about this very private person, but I will say one thing, he was probably the most underated individual in the world of entertainment.Not only did he have a fantastic voice (better than FS) but he came across as such a fun loving, personable and talented singer, actor, comedian and never got 5 stars which in my estimation, he deserved 10 stars!"
1,Truly awful,"This book is notable to me as being the worst biography I have ever read - truly awful in it's laughable use of language so dense that it clearly aims to obscure the fact that this author had nothing new to offer on his subject. Or maybe he's a frustrated amateur psychologist. I hate the fact that I actually put up with it and finished the book - but I loathed the author even more all the way through it (readily yelling out WTF? at some of the more affected/pretentious paragraphs).Not sure if the author has written other books, but I'll remember his name to ensure I avoid other tomes.Sorry the review is so hateful - but that's my gut reaction whenever I recall this book."
2,Disappointing Biography,"At times I found Nick Tosches' prose practically unreadable and incomprehensible. Every other sentence [used much profanity]. This is hard to believe in spite of Dean Martin's decline during the 1970/1980s. Tosches makes too many assumptions about Martin and the author's reputation as a ""stylish"" writer is ludicrous. Unless one is a diehard Dean Martin fan, I do not recommend this book unless you want to learn how NOT to write a biography."
2,Unecessary Excessive Foul Language,"Thick book with Lot's of details and history on many of the people who came into his life. Unecessary & Excessive foul language throughout. Freq reverts to a word in Italian here and there. Which I found distracting. I don't agree with Dean being portrayed as a person who didn't care. He did things his way and it seems pretty much kept his feelings to himself. Still, I think his actions often showed he cared, both for others and his carreer.Not a book I'll be keeping or recommend to anyone. As other have said, nothing really here you couldn't get elsewhere where it'd be written better. Unlike others I haven't read everything on Dean but I did like his Daughter Deanna's book."
2,nothing new,"Since I am a super hard core Dino fan, (since I was 8 1949), and have just about read everything there is on Dino, including every gossip magazine, and had 3 personal encounters with the man, I was very disappointed in this book. There was nothing in the book that hadn't been documented earlier, and the language Dino supposedly used and thought was unnecessary and annoying.I am convinced no one will ever be able to give clear insight into the man's life since he and his family carefully hid any deep personal information. Dean himself underplayed his entire life and what he really did not ""give a damn"" about is what anyone thought. I wish the best of luck to those who wish to produce a film about this man. About the only good thing we might get is a great soundtrack!!As for Mr. Tosches book, there were some great photos!!"
5,Absolutely Love The Product,This is the only dryer sheets I can use since I have such sensitive skin. It's a wonderful product and alot less itching with it!
4,Cuddly Yaya and Youyou her baby,"Lovely, cuddly panda really the perfect size for little arms and big enough that they dont go around it completely. a perfect gift for a little loving person. the fur is really soft and good quality. Because it looks sad it gets a lot of hugs. Maybe it could look a little bit happier, children would not be worried when they see it."
5,An introduction to Zimology,"South African horn player (saxophones, flute) Zim Ngqawana defines ""Zimology"" as ""the study of self"". In this album, released in 1998, we get a chance to experience the process of Zimology performed by Zim and his quartet. Although influenced by African American giants such as Arthur Blythe, Archie Shepp and Max Roach, most of Zim's music shows deep South African roots. Most of the tunes have a distinct South African rhythm and harmony, while Zim's saxophonics or flutonics connect his home sounds with those of his American mentors. Track 9, Qula Kwedini, is a perfect example of music that is completely South African yet obviously connected with African American jazz.I had a chance to meet Zim in person. His gentle, quiet fire, is as evident in his personal conduct as it is in his music. This is important music for anyone who into the spiritual aspect of African and African American music."
4,Usefull reference book,It is really usefull as for reference as for review an existing Supply Chain.
5,The Amazing Spectrobes,"Spectrobes is a great game, but you need a lot of patience when you try to find fossils, particularly #21 & #22. The only downfall is that the game is not very long. You can go online and get more Spectrobes which extends your play somewhat. For those who like Pokemon, Yu-gi-oh, and similar games, you will like Spectrobes a lot!~D in MD"
4,kids loved it,Just the thrill of seeing Disney characters made this program compelling to a 5 and 7 year old. They both loved the spray can and tried the different shapes. It was a good time killer and at least the kids weren't shooting anyone. I have to also say that the kids kept laughing as they were amused at the pictures they were making.
4,Very Kid Friendly,"I have 2 kids ages 6 & 3. Both of them can work with this program independently. My 6 year old son loves to create scenes using the animated characters with music. Then he saves the scenes, pulls them up later, and adds color to them. My 3 year old daughter just loves to color in the spaces with the different coloring utensils. She can change the utensils by herself. My son has figured out parts of it that I haven't even done yet. Get it with the Sketch Board so the kids can use it like a drawing tablet and it is tons of fun! The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I can't figure out how to work some of it. Then again, I don't spend as much time with it as my son."
1,Not for OS X,"How disappointing that Disney would release this CD Rom for OS but it is not compatible with OS X! The box says 8.1 or higher, but it's wrong. The program runs, but is unable to print. Both Disney Interactive tech support and Apple (Genius Bar) have confirmed this. Do NOT buy this for Mac if you are running OS X. (Even in classic it can't print.)"
5,Best $10 we've spent!,"Actually, I should say the best $10 my mom spent... she purchased this for my 4-year old who has literally spent hours playing this software. It is a wonderful tool for fostering not only artistic ability, but also imagination and creativity-- not to mention computer skills. It's fun for adults too, as there are so many hidden treasures in this software- we are always finding something new. Given the pricetag and the quality of this program, I say - what are you waiting for? Get it!!"
3,Pretty good game,"This is a pretty fun game for my daughter however, we ended up getting the Magic Artist Deluxe version. We kept getting an error message even after doing the patch for the original version. My daughter would get frustrated because it always popped up and would shut the game down. The newer deluxe version has no issues and works fine with XP which is what we have. It also has some really cool upgrade from the original. I'd wait on this and get the deluxe version (we bought a used one) and do that unless you have an older computer."
4,Enjoyed by readers during Lincoln's era,"This is probably the best early biography of Lincoln, produced by someone who collected information from persons who knew Lincoln before and during the White House years. The book was produced before the President was surrounded by a godlike aura, and presents the man as Americans of his time wanted to remember him. His last law partner William H. Herndon found the portrayal too pretty, but it pleased the reading public."
3,An new twist to Doctor Who,"The Brain of Morbius is certainly different from most Doctor Who stories. It takes alot from Frakenstein, even with a hunchback to boot! This story probes a little deeper into the still myserious Time Lords, revealing a power struggle at the top of the High Council. An interesting story, showing another powerful race almost equal to the Time Lords, and also a corrupt ruler."
4,"""Superb head!""","On Karn, strange things are going on. What is Solon and his servant, Condo, doing in his laboratory? And why is the Flame of Life dying in the temple of the Sisterhood? An excellent Frankensteinesque Who story. With a small cast, the performances are terrific. Condo, the dumb mute with a missing hand, Marn and Ochica in the Sisterhood, displaying their paranoia of losing their immortality, and Phillip Madoc as Solon is the anchor, a marvelous performance! Along with it being very creepy, it's also VERY violent, giving the story a extremely dramatic view. Another masterpiece written by Terrance Dicks."
3,Good Story,"While I know many revere this as a classic, I find it merely to be a good Doctor Who story. But in my opinion it is one of the weakest of the Hinchcliffe Era Doctor Whos. fortunately, that means it's still one heck of an adventure. The main failings come with the irritating sisterhood, and the oft-campier than usual production values. But many images and characters stick with the viewer, and Tom Baker, and particularly Elizabeth Sladen shine brghtly."
5,BEAUTIFUL,It's great. mom and i looked all over for a cute and affordable diaper bag but we didn't find anything.then we looked at babies r us and we found it. u wouldn't want to smell yucky diapers.love summar
2,Lulu - Ilona Steingruber,Don't make a mistake. There is two versions with Ilona Steingruber. The LP is wonderful. This one is not that good.Martin - Canada
2,For my ELLA,The DVD wasn't very entertaining for my 1 year old who loves Ella Jenkins' music. I found the recording and production quality very poor.
5,A really nice help,"This is one of the nicest little additions to have along for that finer print as we get older. The light is especially nice, and it is one of the most convenient ways to magnify parts of a page. The size is just right, and it has enough rigidity as to be easy to handle and hold. The seller is top notch and helpful also. You won't likely be disappointed with this little friend."
5,Bronco:Shadow of Jessie James,This series alternated with Cheyenne. It was well made and entertaining. I watched it as a Kid and enjoyed seeing it again.
5,Great for reading strategies,"Gleam and Glow is an ecellent book for teachers to use when teaching reading strategies. I used it with seventh graders. Even though it is a young children's book, the content makes it perfect."
4,Gleam and Glow,This book is really good. I would recommend it to all kids. It is about two girls and their mom. Their Dad is in the war. Gleam and Glow is a very good book. The title of the book is for the two fish that Marina names Gleam and Glow. I really enjoiyed this book. ...
1,Not what's portrayed on the cover,"My almost-four year old picked this out at the library. The cover looks innocent, showing two goldfish and a dragonfly. I didn't think this was an appropriate book for him - the father goes underground, their home is flooded with people escaping the country, then they themselves must leave their home and spend time in a refugee camp. When they return home, their house has been burned but all that is left are the goldfish. This would be a good teaching book to understand other kids have a very difficult life, but not good for reading before bedtime. Or for younger children."
4,Full of valuable insights for managers and scholars alike,"Galbraith has succeeded in filling the gap that he intended to fill in that specific area of management literature where organization theory and international business research interact. Although I was initially rather skeptical of the scholarly value of the book - since it appears to be particularly aimed at practitioners - I was pleasantly surprised at the wealth of novel theoretical insights that I was able to extract from it. Although it clearly builds on Galbraith's earlier work (for which he is renowned), it definitely adds something to the field. This book will leave those interested in international business (both practice and theory!) with an enhanced understanding of some of the organizational aspects of the multinational corporation that seem to me to be relatively underresearched."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I've been intrigued by this trend of ""stripper workouts."" I was looking for something to get my heart rate up and my husband's, too. I did not get what I was hoping for. First of all, the ""dance"" lessons are very basic and really cheesey. I guess that's ok for someone who has never seen a stripper dance. But I didn't get anything out of it. The ""bonus"" scene was VERY unexpected. At the end of the dvd there's a straight-up porn scene. It starts out as a lap dance to ""demonstrate"" the steps learned in the video, but it quickly becomes a completely nude, porn-quality sex scene. Just be prepared if you order this dvd."
3,Helpful but Misleading,"I bought this DVD based on the excellent reviews for instruction on private erotic dance. The first half of the DVD is good - the instructor emphasizes the importance of self-esteem and pleasing yourself in order to please your partner. She covers basic moves (hip rolls, sensual slides, etc...) and standing/walking sexily with confidence. They frequently cut from the instructor to a woman who is following the DVD in her home. The second half of the DVD is the woman implementing what she learned from the DVD on her boyfriend. It seems very staged and she starts out wearing an ugly old-fashioned suit and overcoat. She performs her routine, which lasts way too long, and then the DVD degenerates into pornography, complete with cheesy music. There were several things advertised that were not covered in the instruction and the ""extra scene"" was more porn. In conclusion, the instruction is above average, but I was disappointed with the purchase."
1,CHEESY PORN-O,"This Video is VERY misleading !!I was hoping to have some fun and impress my husband with some new moves, what I got was a Cheesy Video showing me how to walk ""sexy"" per say and had a cheesy Porn Scene at the end!My husband watched it later on and Laughed his ass off !If you a tomboy trying to be FeminineONLY THEN would I reccomend it for you."
5,On target,This was actually an instructional video. This was what we were looking for and are very pleased with this video.
4,Very erotic --- but NOT porn,"What a shame that other reviewers describe this as porn.I suspect that they find actual sex to be something that should be hidden--when, really, it should be celebrated and enjoyed as a natural part of human experience.This video differs from standard porn by not concentrating on closeups of penetration and showing no ""money shots"" of the male ejaculation.But it does show a mutual joy in sharing totally explicit sex. It's their loss that they cannot see that as the natural reason for a woman to perfrom an erotic dance for her lover. How sad!"
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed. I was going to show my girlfriend, but it had porn after the lesson. In fact, there was more porn than there was instruction."
1,Feeble at best,If I had the choice I would rate it 0 stars. The video talks to people like children and treats the viewer as if they've had no human contact in their life.
1,If you want a porn flick...,"I was not happy with this purchase. This video only taught 10 min. of teaching followed by 30 min of a porn flick at the end. The teaching was informative balanced with different women with various shapes and builds, I could have used more teaching and less of a porn show. This was a waste of money! There are a few more reviews like mine so take our advise."
3,Semi-insturctional,This video does give you some sound advice in how to do an erotic strip dance. It also provides you with some basic moves. However at the end it does have the main model perform for someone. This kinda made it seem more like porn at the end. I think it would have been better if they would have just let the model show you the dance and not involve all the rest. I would not recommend this video if you want to learn how to strip but it is okay as an erotic video to watch with your boyfriend.
1,Loving Sex-Erotic Strip Dance- Capture His Passion,All I can say is that this item is very bad. I mean it's trash.I'm sorry to say it but it is 0 star.
1,Flop!,"This is a horrible, repetitive book. I can't believe this is supposed to be for adults! I am in middle school, and the P.E. teachers read this to us, to try to make us work harder and be more energetic. Sorry, people, but this book put us to sleep (literally, in some cases...) they even named their class F.I.S.H. after this monotonous book! It stands for FINDING INDIVIDUAL STRENGHTS IN HEALTH. On the beginning of the year schedule it said this class was called ""World Famous F.I.S.H.,"" everyone spent the whole day laughing and wondering about what the hey this class was going to BE. Here are some tacky, tasteless initials for you! T.B.I.H.(This Book Is Horrible!)"
1,Making the difficult silly,This is one of the worst management books I've ever read. The objective is to boost employee morale and create a commitment to change. There is a great risk that the book will create the opposite. Motivating people is a difficult task. This book will not help. Save your money.
1,This book is pretty bad...,"This is one of the all time worst books. I can't imagine getting anything lasting out of this overly simplistic piece of work. This is worse than the cheese book. The 4 main points of the story were hardly new and the actual ""story"" was was simply awful. I loved the way they introduced the husband on one page and then killed him off on the next page to give the main character an excuse to move to Seattle. That was deep. And what a great touch having her marry the fishmonger in the end-it darn near brought a tear to my eye!I wish the powers that be in Corporate America would stop inflicting this SEE SPOT RUN nonsense on employees-it is insulting and hardly produces the desired effect. This may be the worst business book that I have read because I got nothing of real substance out of the book."
1,ugh,"I worked for a company who force fed us this philosophy...book, tape, and all. The simple and cornball philosophy gearing this book is ridiculous. The principles, as ideal as they are, are elementary and the story is contrived. What's sad is that companies actually think that throwing fish around is something that should be done (the company I worked for had a fish throw...an actual afternoon dedicated to throwing dead fish at each other). As for its effectiveness, I was burned out on the philosophy after two days of training and I voluntarily left the company 2 months after being hired. The video portion of this philosphy isn't better... ... ."
5,Short but inspiring.,I showed the video of Fish several years ago for a managers meeting. It was powerful then and a good read again. Still as valuable as when first viewed.
1,Good Only So Far,"The idea is good: Four simple steps to make your workplace dynamic, fun and customer oriented. But to prevent any note of negativity from intruding on this Never-Never Land there's nothing to this book beyond these four steps. Are your customers crabby even though you've ""chosen your attitude?"" Does your boss think that ""play"" is goofing off? Did you ""make their day,"" and get a grievance filed against you for harassment?And what happens when you try to ""be present"" with coworkers who have joined the living dead and want only to suck the energy from your soul?Most of us work in the Dilbert Universe where our best efforts are wasted on demented coworkers, jerk customers and insane bosses.I pity the poor supervisor who gets saddled with implementing the chirpy ideas in this book. They may not fail but if they do it will because THEY are at fault, not the authors."
2,a good lunchtime read but too abrupt for a book,"The book does not provide adequate information on morale boosting. The examples cited do not occur too often in real life, and the situations are far too idealistic than the ones we encounter everyday.No theory or research or whatsoever has been cited, making me wonder whether the content come from the author's dreams or pure imagination.The book is also too short for a full fledged book to be published, I think that it's more appropriate to publish in a newspaper or blog.Overall, it's a good lunchtime read, have a good laugh, and forget about it. It's not worth your money to buy it."
1,"Great for storytelling, empty on substance","Hold on to your seats. Here comes yet another quirky, poorly written fantasy story about how a fishmonger who helps a businesswoman to solve the poor productivity and low morale problems in her customer service department. Good ole Lonnie is so successful, in fact, that he becomes engaged to our heroine in the final act. (No, I'm not making this up)While FISH offers an introspective look at why employees respond the way they do, it offers little if anything on how to bring the poor performing unit through a real rebirth. As Dr. Phil would say, this book lacks ""verbs in its sentences"" when it comes to designing a plan of action.This book, like HIGH FIVE and many others, is simply another way for the authors to cash in on a new twist of a very old philosophy."
4,Stupid Book--Good Points,"When my supervisor handed me this book and asked me to read it I rolled my eyes. When I started to read it--oh boy, they rolled even more. But you have to take these parable books with a grain of salt. Is there anything so bad about asking people to ""Choose Their Attitude"" or ""Be Present"" for the customers? No, of course not. And what's wrong with trying to keep the mood a little light at work--nothing bad there. We've used some of the ideas in this book, and tossed the few back in (no one is going to be asked to bake cookies and I'd probably get thrown a few cans of tuna if I set up a ""sandbox"" area). Perhaps the most helpful concept has been the idea of treating your co-workers as ""customers"", it certainly makes you think twice about what you say and helps you to treat each other with the same respect you would an actual customer or client.Overall I'd say taking what I'd consider useful out of this book has worked to change the attitude and performance of my staff."
2,Dont waste your time or money,"Giving the content (I got the CD) of this book the highest rating is an insult to really great books. If you get the CD you will hear two examples of the fish market in action, I found it amazing that in the first - the worker quotes an incorrect price to a customer, in the second example they are yelling a lewd joke back and forth while working, one that if it was told in my office could get a person fired (granted I work in a sensitive environment). I give it two stars because I thought a point really not stressed in the material, getting all the workers involved and to buy in, is important. But I would still shy away from this fluff, and I will take high reviews from numerous reviewers less seriously in the future. BTW - the author throws in some really corney stuff with the main characters personal life they did not need to, be forwarned!"
3,"happy happy, joy joy","The heart of Fish! is in the right place, but the execution is abysmal. Simplistic to the point of being condescending, much of the Fish! message is spelled out in a Dick and Jane sort of way. If you can get past the tone of the book, it's got a good theory behind it. However, for those of us who are cynical by nature, be forewarned -- the Fish! philosophy relies heavily on being a shiny, happy person. If you're like me and the thought of smiling, happy faces 24/7 brings out your inner postal worker, you might want to skip this one and go straight forWho Moved My Cheese?Rating: C-"
2,Cute and dangerous at the same time,"I certainly can't argue about its basic premise. Reminding yourself that you have a choice in how you feel is important. My concern is not with the book's premise. I'm concerned about managers who misuse this book as a panacea for their lack of leadership. It's one thing to work under difficult conditions, but it's another to have thoughtless and weak ""leaders"" who exacerbate the situation. I've seen it happen where these types of managers have the nerve to hold this type of book up in front of a group of people and imply the problem is the workforce for not choosing to be happy about poor leadership.If you're a manager, think about what this book is actually telling you."
1,Mindless dribble,Want to know why this book has sold so many copies? Because it is the center of countless crappy leadership building classes. The only people who enjoy this book and think that it contains anything besides fluffy bullcrap are morons who eat up this whole genre with a fork and knife.
3,New Age Mantra!!!!!!! Again,"Attitude is the key throughout this book. It is a good read for everyone as it stresses on one of the important aspects of work life, Attitude. But beyond that there are other issues like functional and management skills which are equally important in todays business. The contents are similer to many of the new age books that you find in the market. One of the things that stands out in this book is that the book is very simple and easy to read. See if you can get it in a local library before buying it."
5,Wish I'd had this book during my management career,"During twenty-three years of management in several organizations, I faced the same problems Mary Jane confronted. Sometimes I patched them temporarily, yet I can't claim that I ever solved them. Had this book been available to read and then discuss during staff retreats, I am confident that participants would have expressed their feelings more openly--and constructively--than they did under my leadership. I applaud what this book accomplishes with its homespun style."
5,Grab your pole and let's go FISH!,"Fish! should be required reading for every person who is in a position to motivate people. The neat thing is that by the end of the book you will realize that we are all in that position. Fish! presents its 4 principles in such a fun easy to understand way that you will want to smack yourself in the head and say, ""I should have written this!"" The ideas and concepts are extremely easy to grasp and the presentation of them is super. If you are looking for a book to help you get motivated at work or at home but don't want to get bogged down by heavy reading then Fish! is for you. I would recommend that any one in management or a supervisory position most definitely read it. In fact I plan to get a copy for each person on my staff."
5,An absolutely must read if you get out of bed every morning,"This heart warming story is for every one! If your an executive, parent, brother, sister, friend or simply put-- just have a pulse, buy it, READ IT and live the basic principles of ""PLAY, BE THERE, MAKE THEIR DAY, and Choose your ATTITUDE! You have no idea how 112 pages can simplify things."
1,Drown me!,"This book is HORRIBLY written. I cringed the whole way through the book because of the narrative style, the point of view violations, the purple sentimentality, and the impish layout design. Too bad I wasn't the one hired to edit this piece. The content may be relevent to today's society, but there is absolutely no way I can recommend this book because of the obtuse writing style. Why did I even bother finishing this book? Well, the CEO required it. This book is easily written (my ten year old sister could finish this in a day), but it took me over a month to finish this book because I become ill after picking it up. Whoever editted this book should look for a new job, for evidently he/she doesn't know a thing about writing!"
2,For Nerds,"The message of this book is a good one. It essentially boils down to ""Have a positive attitude."" However, this book uses a lame nerdy parable to communicate this message, and it's embarrassing. I agree that it is a productive thing to have a good attitude and that a good attitude is contagious, but the book asks you to be a big phony and do lame grade school type of activities with your staff. I don't know about you, but I can't stand being treated like a 2-year-old when I'm at work, and the reality is that you have to be fake in order for everyone to ""jsut get along."" Most employees have a bad attitude because so many companies are badly run with poor management. Reading books like this is just putting a bandaid on a broken leg."
2,Fish too sweet,The book is too saccharine and simplistic. I also had the pleasure of listening to the audio book as well. The condescending tone was annoying and I felt as if the approaches were unrealistic.The underlying principles were reasonably valuable but personally did not like the delivery.
4,An interesting way to try and keep morale up during troublesome times,I had seen the video at a business class earlier this year and wanted to check behind the scenes as it were.This book does offer insight about the importance of providing amazing customer support for both the employee and customer.It shows that it is possible to have a good time and fun in your job no matter what your job is.It did remind me a little of the other good business books Who Moved my Cheese and the One Minute Manager.
5,Particularly good for groups,"As a business consultant, I am always looking for new tools to use with group facilitation. I have used this book in several corporations and have found it to be excellent at inspiring group discussion, buy-in, and commitment. The book is a fun, quick read and I have never been at a company that did not profit from this book. There doesn't seem to be a lot out there around the topic of motivation. This one fits the bill!"
2,where's the beef?,"Extremely predictable by the end of first 'encounter"". Can't imagine this being anything but the most basic intro in workplace relations unless last job was in Soviet bloc munitions plant..."
3,A Pleasant Way to Spend an Hour,"While this book contains no earth-shaking truths, taking an hour or so to read it can give you a fresh perspective. And isn't that what we so often need in our hectic lives?The book has four recommendations that can help keep that fresh perspective alive during the work days. It's a relaxing read. Because you will come away with at most four short points that you may record as a reminder for yourself, I recommend checking this one out from your local library. I'm glad I read it; I'm also glad I didn't buy it. It's not a book that you would go back to again and again."
1,really?,"If MOST of your employeesa) are not having fun,b) want to be anywhere else but there,c) are watching out for what management is thinking/doing instead of what serves the customers, andd) GENERALLY have poor attitudes,IT'S BECAUSE YOUR COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT SUCKS!...not because your employees are stupid and flawed..."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Mary Jane Ramirez has just been put in charge of Hell. That's how bad her new assignment seems, before she stumbles upon the inspiring management secrets of The Pike Place Fish Market. This effective little tale introduces readers to ""Fish!"" - the authors' prescription for boosting employee morale and productivity. The fish-tossing, joke-cracking camaraderie of the market serves as the workplace ideal in this book, which is easy to read but carries a lasting punch. We at getAbstract recommend this book to executives, change agents, managers, staff members, and students. Whether you are trapped in a bad working environment or trying to improve a mediocre one, this book will inspire you to get up and change your surroundings. Fish! will be one of the most influential books you read all year."
1,Purpose???,"you would be better off reading ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH, BLUE FISH by DR. SEUSS (he's a Dr. too)This stuff is just too much like the ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" book which is completely condescending and mindless.Try to make the most of everyday. Things change, that is life. It is all about developing ""coping"" skills.It is so short, go to the library and read it while you are sitting there, you don't even need to check it out, it is that short."
1,Trite and smarmy,"My boss made me read this. Fortunately, it only took about ten minutes. Okay, so it actually took about an hour, but there was so little content that the essence of the book could have been communicated in about 15 pages. I thought the ""parable"" was bad enough before I got to the completely predictable end. Not inspiring in the least. Instead, I found myself wondering if I could take a few completely obvious concepts and write a fluffy little book that would become a management fad, spawn several spinoff products, and make me a bucketload of money."
5,splish splash for my new fishy affirmation!,"First those darling rodents helped me with my cheese 'tude in ""Who Moved My Cheese."" Now I have these charming 2 year old fish thank for improving moral and boosting results. Or, boosting morale and improving results! Have it your way, I am used to my cheese being moved, so I don't mind the correction!Three glorious hurrahs for the fish. I am much more highly motivated and boosted, in a results-oriented way, through fish-management technics than I am by that cat-o-nine!"
4,You don't have to like fish to enjoy fishing.,"The ""Fish!"" reminds us that we do have a choice in choosing the attitude we wish to display towards our workmates and our work, and that choice will have either positive or negative repercussions on our work environment. As the narrative suggests, we don't necessarily have to like the work we do to enjoy coming to work, and that can make our life that much more interesting and productive."
3,A great place to start,"Stories make for wonderful teaching tools. FISH, based on the famed Pikes Fish Market, presents a compelling argument why every company needs to incorporate passion and fun into what it puts out. I would also recommend Get Weird by John Puetz. Good work, as long as you incorporate the ideas and don't abandon them 30 days from now. Otherwise, it becomes another addition to the Flavor of the Month slush pile."
4,"If your workplace disgusts you, read this book","It was an easy reading book, and a book that makes you look very positively at life.It mostly pertains to how good you can make a work place feel and look like, but a lot of it also helps you in the way you look at a life on the wholeI was first introduced to the pike fish market through this book. And i realised if a fish market can be a beautiful to place to work in, then, its just in our minds to make any place that we work, a place that we look forward to go back."
3,ok,The shipping took forever! but that's expected. almost about everything i buy on here; the shipping takes long even if you expedite your shipping.
2,Mary Ann,"Very disappointed.Cover of book states to Be Sold only in India, Nepal, Bangledash. Hello this is the US.Words were even spelled incorrectly. How disappointing. I bought 8 books for a Morale booster boy do I look like a fool.I may never purchase anything on Amazon again, WOW Who knows what you may get.Definitely not the book/cover I thought I purchased"
4,Simple is Best,"Like the ""One Minute Manager"" and ""Who Moved My Cheese"", this book is a short book with a simple and entertaining story. However, that is the best tool for learning.In this case, the lessons are on how to create a fun, positive workplace atmosphere that enriches the workers while contributing to the bottom line. Think of a company like Southwest.Some people might say that the lessons are simplistic and common sense but, after working for 20 years, I can definitely say that they are not commonly practiced."
4,Choose Your Day!,"Quick read and presents well the idea that work is play. Be present in the moment and choose your attitude.Brett Vanderwater, MBA, CIA, CMA, CTP"
5,A Must Read for Managers,I saw my boss with some notes on her desk about Fish and grabbed a copy of it to read it.The stories told throughout Fish help to weave a wonderful book into an even better message. I think it's safe to say that many of us (if not all of us) have experienced the toxic work environment at least once. Creativity and enthusiasm are directly related to the happiness of the workers in a workplace. The draw of inspiration from the fish market is excellent because I think a lot of times we think that a job that is not particularly attractive is not going to be the happiest place to work. Not only does Fish prove that thought process wrong but it is also shows that changing the environment of your office is quite simple.
4,Great Points but Same Story,"This book has a great message for boosting morale in the office, but I feel like it's the same story that is told is similar books. There is always some company that is failing or not doing well and then the manager uses some motivation strategies and changes the whole office. I wonder how effective this would be in most offices and if it would actually work. The points listed in the book are very valuable, but the story makes it seem easier to implement then it really might be."
3,Fish,"I like the concepts, though I found the story to be a bit lacking. We've instituted these practices at work and I've got to say that I'm enjoying it. Having fun at work is HUGELY important and this book teaches to that concept."
5,Think motivational books don't work? This book is for you...,"I'm not kidding, it will change your mind. It's an incredible book. Coming from me, that's a huge compliment, given that I normally think most of this motivational stuff is just salespeople pitching common sense fluff to make a buck. ""Fish!"" will change the way you think about your workplace and your life. It's a very simple story, and somewhat cheesy at the end, but you won't regret reading it. There's nothing in here that you haven't heard before, but it's the way it's presented in the context of workplace that too many of us are all too familiar with that really makes the philosopy carry so much weight. Don't be surprised if, after reading the book, you find yourself wanting to spend your lunch break in Seattle one of these days."
3,Sometimes the movie is better than the book,"When I saw the original film, from which this book was made, I was inspired like never before and put many of the principles to good use. When I read the book two years later, I found it seriously lacking. Where the movie is both exciting and insightful, the book is quite pedestrian. It seems almost as if it had been written by a high school student. Buy the movie, grab yourself a bag of popcorn and prepare yourself for a (real) paradigm shift."
1,All it does is state the obvious,"Mary Jane is given a tough assignment - bring life to the third floor of their business, which is currently known as a toxic energy dump. She gets inspiration from the famous Pike Fish Place, and a worker there named Lonnie.Mary-Jane learns that you have to make the best of every situation. You choose your attitude - you can go to work each day thinking ""Another boring day...I wish it were the weekend"" or you can think ""Who can I help today?"" - it's your choice.It's also important to play. Jokes are an important way of boosting morale.I've never been a manager, and I'm only twenty years old, yet I already knew everything this book said. All it does is tell you things that are plain common sense. If you are a manager, the odds are that this book will not tell you anything new.The positives are that the book is easy to read, easy to understand and very short. Recommend it to those employees with a negative attitude."
1,Get a whiff of this--,"Although Fish! is a light-hearted read, the authors provide no scientific evidence that the principles discussed will lead to any major changes; however, that is not to imply that the four principles are not effective. The authors do little to provide any real-world solutions to companies where a ""Play Team"" and ""Sand Box"" would probably be whimsically discarded for lack of credibility. Additionally, the main character's role is poorly developed and reads more like a cancelled soap-opera than a practical solution for overwhelmed managers. A tremendously easy-to-read book cleverly celebrating employee morale at work, this story reads like its title smells-FISH!"
1,Watch out for the sharks,"Among the tools available for human resources personnel to use in implementing the Fish! Philosophy are fluffy, brightly-colored plush fish toys. If human beings were all so soft and cheerful, the Fish! Philosphy would work very well.I first read this book a year ago when the corporation I work for adopted the precepts of the Fish! Philosophy. I thought the book was charming and I was enthusiastic about how the ideas in it could improve our workplace.A year wiser now, I realize that this philosophy, although well intended, can become a sharp and cruel weapon in the endless power games that humans play in the workplace. We aren't fluffy toys or pretty little tropical fish all swimming in schools in warm waters. There are sharks among us, as well as pirana, hammerheads, eels, and other dangerous types. The Fish! Philosophy just doesn't work because it gives the predators too much of an advantage over their prey."
5,American Ginseng is the best Ginseng around,"I have increased energy and stamina thanks to these ""little miracles in a bottle"". I drank two vials a day for the first week and then one vial a day since. Since I began taking these I have quit drinking coffee. I don't feel ""slumped"" anymore in the afternoons and I sleep better at night. As a bonus, my complexion has cleared and smoothed considerably and I have a regular ""movement"" about 2 hours after I drink my vial. Energy from the inside out."
4,Very good New Hinsons~~ Amazon.com Gospel,"I sure miss The elder Hinsons, but this family just keepspassing the talent down to the younger generations. thiscd is as spirit filled as the elders and I recommend it foryour spiritual music collection."
4,Why no unanimous assent to historical Parousia???,"Unless Christ's 70AD 2nd Coming can be unequivocally demonstrated as historical a fact as Incarnation, Miracles, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension - i.e. proven, documented, Holy Spirit-attested, apostolically supported, inscripturated and undeniable across Christendom's Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox communions - then Pastism or any strain of preterism or fulfilled historicism is D.O.A."
4,Solid tent for the money with a few minor issues,"Used this at a 2 day music festival and loved the design and roominess of this tent. This tent took a pretty good beating from the rain on the first day/night and held up great.The only issues I had were the cheap plastic rings that are used to connect the rain fly to the tent stakes. When I was taking the tent down 2 of the 5 rings broke when I was unhooking them. Not a big deal in my eyes because I can replace all 5 with metal rings for next to nothing (think metal key chain rings!) The only other issue I had was that the small pole used over the doorway was missing an end cap, problem was easily resolved with a couple pieces of duct tape. I'm sure if I called the company they would have sent me a free one...but whateverIn summary, great tent for under $70. I give 4 out of 5 due to the little issues mentioned above...wish I could give 4.5. Highly recommended for a camper or hippie on a budget"
2,Leaked on second use.,"It's a nice tent...roomy...has a sturdy floor...but it LEAKED the second time I put it up! The seams of the rain fly leaked where the ""cargo net"" hooks hung from. As much as I liked the cargo net...I could have done without it to have a tent that was watertight.Also...I would prefer smaller ditty bags along the walls of the tent. I found that I had no place to store my glasses. I think I'll stick to a more name brand tent next time. If you're going to buy this tent...buy SEAM SEALENT and treat it before using it."
2,"Great idea, bad materials?","I ordered this kit because it looked like a great new way to use hole saws. They are sharp and cut well but the big problem is the arbor, it's absolute junk. I don't know about you but when drilling holes with larger bits it's easy to have them hook and stop suddenly. With the old type of arbor, all you had to worry about was smashing your knuckles in tight quarters, or maybe a broken wrist or two :) The arbors for this set bend very easily when they hook. I've gone through three and the third was my last one. I doubt that I drilled 20 holes with the three arbors. Maybe if I was using a drill press to drill holes in wood that's clamped down to the table it might work well. Hopefully another company will make a set that actually works."
5,Great!,"Herbaliser is possibly the best group in the incredibly deep talent reservoir of the Ninja Tune label and this CD proves it. So far it is their best one, with great raps and jazzy, spy soundtrack-like music. Probably a best way to get to know this band. Get it. Anything from Ninja Tune is worth buying."
3,Campaign propoganda,"THis book is by no means a bad book. It stated the facts clearly and accurately. It was honest. It did not try to sidestep the fact that Al Gore smoked marijuana, that he has overexaggerate many facts. It also brought out all of his good points too. I will quickly mention that I was for Al Gore in the 2000 election.But, when you get right down to it, ""The Prince of Tennessee"" is campaign propoganda. It's just here to glorify Al Gore, which I have no problem with. It tries to disguise itself by being so brutally honest, but don't let it decieve you. Campaign propoganda, whether it's negative or positive, is never really good reading. It's almost always one-sided and can get very boring. This holds true now. REally good biographies are written after the subject is dead."
1,The rise and fall of modern man,Why doesn't this boo talk about all the shady dealS IN AL GORE'S past. Why is that? Down with the System
1,"I lost $15000, in 1 year","I had snipe & extreme options at a cost of $5000, plus they lost $15000 on automated trading, I did better on my own"
1,Not a very good book,"I did not care for this book! Almost all of his data is limited to 1999 to 2000. A much better book on the subject is ""The Research Driven Investor"" by Timothy Hayes. Save your money on Headley's book, you can have mine for free!"
3,Good book but,The book contents is OK but it is not a thorough analysis of the option strategies and techniques.
2,It's ok.,"Some of the nuggets are more like pebbles. The book seems more like an infomercial to sign up for his picks through his website/stock picking services. If you're looking for real tips to reading the market, I'd say check out some of J. Cramer's books. Cramer isn't perfect, but who is? At least Cramer tells it like he sees it. If Eliot Spitzer likes Cramer, then he can't be that bad!"
5,An excellent prologue to the show......,the Roar book was great because it gives you all the background for the show in great detail. (even if it is a little late for that) i loved the show and was upset when it went off the air in '97. this book was like a breath of fresh air to my stifling passion for Roar. i thoroughly enjoyed it and will read it again and fully intend to read the sequel. A must for any Roarior!
5,Best Book ever,This is the best book I have ever read. I love the details and the plot. It was well written. I hope the series continues after the second book.
5,Outstanding Author!,"I have never seen the show ROAR, but the book was awesome! Sean Kiernan is now one of my favorite authors, and I can't wait to read the sequel. It was great literature, very descriptive. I couldn't put it down. It had a different sort of plot, but very interesting. I recommend it! Great book!"
4,A Great View For All,"I really like all of the Medfield College series (at least that's what I call them) that include ""Now you see him, now you don't,"" ""The strongest man in the world,"" and, ""The Computer wore tennis shoes."" This one was the first one I saw and I think it's still my favorite...although Computer Wore Tennis Shoes is a close second. This movie is a fun view for everybody and you don't have to skip parts. It's one of a increasingly few movies that can be watched straight through with kids present, but yet aren't boring and stuffy either. A great watch for all."
3,"Yes, it has been soft matted to widescreen!","This film has indeed been formatted to widescreen via a process called ""soft matte"". What's soft matte, you ask? In simplistic terms, they put plates (black bars) on screen to block out the top and bottom of the picture of the original film, in order to create a widescreen presentation. So the original prints are in the original 1:37.1 ratio. They soft matted this film in order to create an anamorphic presentation. So in other words, yes, it's fake widescreen."
4,Clever Disney comedy -- in widescreen,"Formulaic, but fun Disney comedy from the 1970's. Thanks to the decision makers at Disney Home Video for releasing this film in widescreen -- let's hope that all future Disney films are released in their original theatrical ratios and that prior releases (like Blackbeard's Ghost, The Moonspinners, and Babes in Toyland) will be re-released in widescreen."
3,Another Disney classic on DVD,"Good cheesy Disney 70's live action movie. I grew up watching these so it's nice to see them on DVD finally. The negative is that it's another film dumped on DVD with no extras. Granted, it's probably not worth the time and energy for them to produce an elaborate disc with the works for a film that will not sell near as many copies as their more popular titles, but something as simple as a quick interview with Kurt Russell and others looking back would be nice.I think Disney needs to start charging half price for these types of releases, like other studios do with their stripped down discs. Nonetheless, the bright side of this one is that it's in Widescreen format."
4,"Now You See Him, Now You Don't",I really enjoy watching a lot of the old Disney movies. This one is very funny and can be enjoyed by everyone in the family!
1,Can I give this less than one star?,"Can I give this less than one star? This book left me wanting my money back. I couldn't identify with what the author was writing about, which is not to say this wouldn't be a helpful book to someone else. It just wasn't for me."
5,Excellent,Excellent book for those interested in dreams and buddhism. A practial guide with examples. I have it next to my bed for a good reference.
5,A Must Read for Parents,"Reading this book was the best gift I have ever given my children! I only wish my parents had had a copy when they were raising me! Intuitive, Sonia Choquette, offers dozens of suggestions including games and excercises to do with children to help them learn to honor their natural intuitive abilities. One specific example that greatly improved our family's intuitve skills was Sonia's suggestion to create our own language to describe our intuitive feelings. For example, when a child has a gut feeling that something feels scarey, they can say I have a ""bad vibe"" or ""the willies"". By teaching your children to acknowledge and honor their intuition they learn to be comfortable listening to their inner teacher, and from my experience the children become more confident and peaceful, and life goes more smoothly."
4,The concept yielded great results,"Here is a simple application of the ""permission marketing"" concept that has worked for my company. We have attendees at every event drop their business cards into a bowl to be entered into a drawing. Within 24 hours following the event, we email all those who have given us ""permission"" to market to them by providing their business card. This allows us to quickly reach out to hundreds of individuals who recently learned about our company's service all for the cost of a gift basket! Find your application of this concept. I bet it will work for you, too."
4,Easy read with great insight,"Okay, so Seth in my opinion is the most insightful of the obvious. But keep in mind that the obvious is often overlooked and Seth does a great job of bring it back to the front. Our clients are the most important thing to the business and without them, there is no business, we do and must continue to treat them well. Seth points out it is far better to work with someone that wants to work with you then to just keep interrupting them until they give in. Read the book, it has good insight."
2,"Well, duh!","Nothing new here. Just lots of old ideas in new Internet wrapping. Will interactive marketing, as it's more often known, eventually replace media advertising? No. Not even close. At least, not for most businesses trying to build a consumer brand presence--nor even for many B2B marketers. Still, this book isn't all bad...just be careful not to mistake it for anything new."
5,Heaven-sent!,"As a professional marketing consultant, I devoured this brilliant book like heaven-sent. So I raised my hand as a translator of Japanese version. You are very lucky,if you have not read this book yet. You have the fun of ""the joy of reading this book"" :-)"
3,Everybody is right,I'll keep it short: If you are novice to marketing ------> buy it. If you are a maketeer ---------------> don't or... Read thru the reviews and find back the whole contents of the book. Well! at least the essentials.
2,Interruptive Marketing Lives!,"While Godin astutely details the need to build relationships with customers, that's been amply covered by other authors. My main beefs with this book are its dismissal of all forms of ""traditional advertising"" and its specious claim that offering prospects incentives is revolutionary. Wasn't John Caples offering how-to booklets to ad respondents sixty years ago?However, Godin frames these tried-and-true techniques within the context of the Information Age, offering helpful examples of relationship marketing using e-mail, the Net, databases and the like. That may be particularly useful to business-to-business marketers. But anyone marketing to consumers should beware...brand story, great copywriting and broad visibility do matter still."
4,Good ideas; test of time would see how practical it is,"The crux of the book is we're going to have to build a trust relationship with someone over time because we can't interrupt them any more than they're being interrupted now; Abide by this trust and you will prosper, abuse it and you will be punished.In my opinion, it does a good job of outlining what the marketer should already know: dangle the carrot and let the customer nibble. As you develop a relationship, bring out other items until you have fierce brand loyalty. The ultimate goal is to be able to do this well on a massive basis. That's the hard part.The book is much more plausible and better written than Regis McKenna's ""Real Time,"" and the inspiration behind the Clue Train Manifesto ....P>I would very much be interested in the followup in 2003, after the dot-com spiral has run its course and there are some better examples of companies who have employed these concepts over time."
4,little book,"Had to read it for a class I was taking. Easy to plow through, read this book while at the sprint car races!!"
4,Can I Sell MY Permission?,Love this book. Very interesting read. Bought it because I'm going to hear Seth Godin speak this summer and I wanted to get an idea where he might be coming from. Offered a fresh perspective that I think would be helpful for most any reader who is interested in how to market more effectively in this VERY noisy age.
3,Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers into Friends and Friends into Customers,"Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers into Friends and Friends into Customers gave me some good ideas, and a good perspective on marketing, but some of the information is dated. I also found some of the book unnecessarily repetitive."
4,Still Very Relevant,Permission Marketing is a marketing timeless classic - a must read for all marketing students and professionals.
5,Great money-making idea generator,"I give this book 5 stars for many reasons, but maninly for the wealth of ideas it has helped me generate. Mr. Godin shows you what you've always known...if you are polite and ask permission, you'll get further ahead than interrupting someone. This book outlines the dangers of interruption marketing and lays out the benefits to treating the customer respectfully and politely."
3,Conceptually right - but....,"Conceptually, doing 'permission marketing' is right on, but there are two faults with this book. (1) The examples are dated. This is being picky, since it was published several years ago, but I say this so you can go in with both eyes open. (2) There's not a really good blueprint here for how to implement permission offers for your own company.I do like the analogy of permission marketing being like dating. It kept the concept understandable and identifiable."
2,Would have made a great article rather than a book,"If the author would have limited himself to a 2 page article in a magazine, his basic idea of buying permission and upgrading it to increase consumer loyalty would have been fine. But since he chose to write an entire book and keeps repeating himself over and over again it is an insult for any half witted marketeer.The book is also extremely US foucsed since no other country gets anywhere near the reach via internet that America can achieve. While it will improve in the future, any internet activity can currently only be one part of an overall marketing approach and it seems that the author does not understand 'traditional marketing' at all.In summary, a nice basic idea but not worth a book!"
4,New to Seth,I have spent more time watching Seth's Blog than reading his books. But recently I bought this book along with purple cows.I love every aspect of marketing and always appreciate a fresh look at the subject. I like it when people don't follow the norm...and even thought this book is not new to the market I found it refreshing and helping me define exactly what I always knew to be true.I am about done and looking forward to reading purple cow which I understand to be an expansion of this book.If you are in this world I would recommend it...
2,This book is totally overrated like everything 'internet'!,"If the author would have limited himself to a 2 page article in a magazine, his basic idea of buying permission and upgrading it to increase consumer loyalty would have been fine. But since he chose to write an entire book and keeps repeating himself over and over again it is an insult for any half witted marketeer.The book is also extremely US foucsed since no other country gets anywhere near the reach via internet that America can achieve. While it will improve in the future, any internet activity can currently only be one part of an overall marketing approach and it seems that the author does not understand 'traditional marketing' at all.In summary, a nice basic idea but not worth a book!"
3,Dated... Long winded...,"In Permission Marketing, Seth Godin, sets forth his principles of what he calls permission marketing. Essentially, becoming a 'trusted friend and advisor' to potential, past, and current customers and gaining the 'right' (or permission) to marketing to them.Basically, that's it. For some two hundred pages, the explanation goes on, and on, and on. I suggest going to the bookstore and spend 30 minutes reading the ""boxed"" summaries that can be found at each chapter. Alternatively, find a used copy -- for much less. But certainly don't buy it for more than (price)."
3,Clues for the Clueless,"This is a clever little book. Not full of great wisdom nor packed with ""Wow"" insights. In fact the writing verges on dull and is partitioned such that every page or so is one full section.However, it is a rich source of ideas when you are stumped as what to do next in marketing or selling. Sort of the book that you hide at home and come in Monday to throw a new idea on the table during the bull session on weekend sports.Don't pay full price for it, but it is a handly little resource."
5,The New Face of Marketing,Seth Godin has correctly identified the paradigm shift in marketing from interruption to permission based systems. You can't help but come to his conclusions after reading the book. His points on the Internet could save many companies a fortune in misdirected efforts. The marketing book of the decade.
1,I wish I could give fewer stars,"I just got a few chapters of this book which ended with ""IF YOU'RE ENJOYING IT, please feel free to post a review on Amazon or on Barnes & Noble. Thanks!"" (emphasis mine). Perhaps those that saw through this chose NOT to reply. He talks of how the quality has gone up(what planet is he from?), and how 900,000,000 pages served from a database of 100,000,000 means 9 views per company. (when is the last time you read EVERY page shown in a query on altavista? I don't know if I EVER have!(some come up with THOUSANDS of pages!) The FACT is that most pages just simply never get viewed! He THEN talks about how companies have profited from graft, favortism, and other tricks. DUH! Heck, just last week on TNT(?) they told how APPLE and M/S profited from it. IBMS exploits in this area are LEGEND! Same with Kellogs! NOTHING NEW!!!!!!! Just more(to put it in set godins words) NOISE! Save your money."
3,Permission Marketing,"Like many of the business to consumer company models that gush about the virtues of one to one marketing, Godin's book is a nice theoretical and idealistic book. Even though I have given many companies ""permission"" to market to me, I have yet to find a company that has been able to do so effectively on a one to one basis. The stock prices of of b to c companies is not only indicative of their inability to manage the logistics of nearly an impossible proposition but also their inability to market directly to the consumer."
1,Dead solid wrong,"The suggestion that the old is out and the new, permission marketing, is in has been so thoroughly disproved by actual experience that it's reasonable to ask, just why does anyone believe there is anything behind that screen that a little tiny man pretending to be the Wizard?A few marketers tried to implement these ideas and found they had offended far more people than traditional advertisers ever had. For that reason, this books ranks with books touting Day Trading as the route to riches. No, never: nonsense.I couldn't even bear to offer this to a used bookstore. Instead, we used it as kindling for a fire. Expensive, but the result was good, and perhaps better than a PrestoLog."
1,"Been there, done that!!",Seth Godin's book as well as his previous ones are nothing more than infomercials for the Internet Age. I felt very let down by some of ideas which all sounded so familiar. He is riding the coat-tails of Yahoo! to market his new book by using his new job at Yahoo! to give this book creditbility.
1,poorly written drivel,This is a poorly written book with an interesting concept but it contains minimal content and is full of repetition. I was very disappointed by this book.
4,Enjoyed Learning About the Concepts,"I enjoyed learning about the concepts in this book. Godin does a good job of explaining the levels of permission that you need in order to gain a customer's comfort level so that you can market directly to them in a personalized way. I also enjoyed learning about the difference between interruption marketing and permission marketing. Being new to field, I appreciate the new comprehension I have with this approach even in evaluating my own interaction with online marketers and e-mail campaigns resulting from me making purchases on the web. Great book."
2,"""At first, you're going to have to use interruption marketin","He admits, and so his whole theory seems a bit b.s. after he's just said that in today's market you cannot use interruption marketing. A little too high on his own thing, sounds like Tom Vu or a religious evangelist, and you read the whole book, and youve paid your 9.99 and you still don't get the secret. Don't waste your money, there is nothing here that is useful that isn't intuitive."
2,UNIT's not what it used to be,"Producer John Nathan-Turner must have completely lost his mind in the mid 1980s. ""Battlefield"" suffers from a poor script, tacky incidental music (by the same composer who ruined the title music in 1987) and bad acting. Sylvester McCoy's Doctor is neither heroic nor mysterious. He isn't funny either. The only bright spot in this story is Jean Marsh, who manages to lend a little dignity to this whole pantomime. The film quality is cheap-looking, almost as though the show was shot entirely with a home videocamera. The appearance of the Brigadier and Bessie are poignant reminders of the Doctor Who of the early 1970's: vibrant, controversial, innovative. Buy this video only after you have bought the old stories. Watch it immediately after watching ""Spearhead from Space"" and you'll find there's no comparison."
4,A must for any Dr. Who or Camelot fan,This is cream of the crop Doctor Who. It features the welcome return of The Brigadier after 6 years in his last appearance to date. And the Doctor is...Merlin? Great center on magic in the Doctor Who universe as well. Primo Stuff.
3,It's certainly possible Merlin was from the future.,"The Doctor and Ace come across the mysteries and magic of Camelot and are re-joined by the Brigadier. Though this is undenighably a good story, it is rather padded-out in Part 3 with endless fight scenes and Ancelyn and Bambera seeming to form to comedy double-act. You can't help feeling this should have been a three-part episode. However, there are some great scenes, some excellent pieces of dialogue and some good images. It just often comes across as quite silly, however, with knights crashing into one another. And how could Morgana be stopped just by locking her up? And why do some characters like Warmsby etc just fizzle out rather than developing?If you're a fan of medieval/sci-fi fantasies like Krull and Willow then this will be of great enjoyment. It's just a shame that the Destroyer, an awesomely impressive monster, was so under-used and came across as more of a mere irritation than the world-eating beast it was meant to be."
2,not what it seems.,"I love the symphony sounds of dragon quest games but this expensive CD is hardly symphonic. its great for those collectors who want to have every single game related item but if you're looking for a symphony suite, I recommend ""dragon quest:the best"" collection. This OST has all the game music from DQ1-7 but it sounds like a midi music. I was very disappointed with this purchase, unfortunately there wasn't much information to go on this collection. I wish there would have been or else I would have spend my money on Dragon quest 4: symphonic suite which I'm going to get anyway."
1,worst game on the GBA,"this is the worst game I have ever played on the GBA. the graphics aren't great, there is no free play, the races are dark and stupid and you can't pick the car you want. the best thing about it is a 3D, bright green arrow that guilds you through the races. this is not what I expected when i got this game. i so don't recommend this game on this system."
4,Enjoyable,"Great disk, although there are some tracks that kind of put a dent in it (The electro funk ones, not into that).Some great electro dream sequences that will make you totally zone out and just listen... track 13 in particular.A lot of the tracks are good for dancing too.Best tracks (IMO) are 4, 11 and 13."
2,Outdated,Much of what this book speaks to is common knowledge and simply provides elongated definitions.
5,As Time Goes By 2,I have a friend that likes the As Time Goes By series. I buy them as gifts to give to my friend.
5,"The most readable, useful intro to the depth Deming's work.","Aguayo has taken great care to truly understand Dr. Demingsteachings before writing this book. He understands Deming'steachings so well that he is able to articulate them in away that long term Deming students truly appreciate, andthat those being introduced to Deming can understand.Many of the books on Deming cover the 14 points and hiselements of profound knowledge in an academic way that isquite alien to most managers. I've handed Aguayo's bookto probably hundreds of people now, and regardless oftheir education and background, they respond to it in avery profound way. One person told me that they neverrealized just how much they didn't know, how sheltered andnarrow their views on life and managment had been, thatthey would never be able to look at life the same way.An excellent and useful book for anyone trying tointroduce Deming to friends, co-workers and upper managers."
5,Fantastic.,"Fantastic. Really gets to the essence of implementing quality and explains Deming's concepts in a truly digestable form. Makes me realize why so many things in our world do and don't work, why most software is lousy, why our system of governance is doomed to produce endless boom/bust cycles, why America is doomed to endlessly lose industries to othter countries, and why my car and lawn mower are both made by Honda. I'm buying copies of this to give away."
4,Useful Book,"This is a good that has stood the test of time that is very useful for those who need a gentle introduction to Total Quality Management. Although the book is about 15 years old with some rather dated examples, the message it gives is still relevant and important.The book written in plain language that focus on the essential quality and productivity message without statistical abstractions, which make it easily understandable to a wide readership. Those readers that have not read Deming's ""Out of the Crisis"" or Mary Walton's ""Deming Management Method"" will benefit the most from reading this book."
4,Outstanding NFL films Dolphins compilation! The NFL will never see another dynasty like the 1970-74 Dolphins. Darn the WFL!,There were so many NFL Pro FootballHall of Famers on this team thatfour Ace Ventura movies couldn'tchase them all down. Forgive DanMarino for that movie though. Miamifans should pick up on this! LongLive Shula!
3,Not the best collection of a Good Old Disco Team,"This is not a best collection of a great German Disco Team.It has some very well known songs and some not common in original versions (AAD Quality).The main problem that majority of the greatest hits are not originals, but English versions. If it is important for you to have the originals, you will be disappointed with this particular set. However, it has almost all of the best songs wit only few exceptions."
4,"Catchy tunes, even if they aren't the latest thing","The members of this band were hand-picked and put together, much like the Monkees were. In fact, their music is sort of a mixture of the Monkees and Abba. Most of these tunes are from the 70's and 80's, but they're still great. My favorites are ""Dschinghis Khan"" (written for the Grand Prix Eurovision contest) and ""Klabautermann"" (a sea spook). They may not be 90's-type songs, but virtually every one is a real toe-tapper."
4,Very pleasent discover,"I used to know only 3 songs of this group : ""Rome"", ""Dschinghis"" Khan, and ""Moscow"". I discovered the other songs of this CD with very big pleasure. The german language is difficult (for me) to listen, so this why I put only 4 stars. The melody of the songs is very easy to follow, and even my son of 5 years old (french educated) use to sing with me when I listened to this album.The songs are the originals +++."
5,DK--a unique concept in pop music,"Granted, many listeners might fail to initially notice Dschinghis Khan due to the fact that while most modern music centers around lyrics in English, DK sticks to German. If you can forgive DK for that indescrepancy (or understand German) you are, however, in for quite an exotic journey. By concept, essentially all DK songs focus on historical personas or unusual geographical spots. DK's crowning as the National Geograpic of pop music is unquestionable. There are a few weak links in the chain, but for most part DK songs attract the musically adventurous mind with a fun journey across time and places!Thumbs up!PS. If you are having trouble finding Dschinghis Khan music, e-mail me at ruudiruudi@yahoo.com"
5,A double album filled of treasures!,"Samson Francois was undeniably the most notable and pyramidal French pianist in the Century XX. His unerring style, impeccable phrasing, refined style, idiosyncratic approach and aristocratic personality defined a sort of pianism hard to find previous or even recently in the whole universe of the pianism's story.That's why his Chopin sounds so original, so fresh and radiant. The lyricism is not a goal by itself but just a part of the sheer expressiveness, admirable honesty, and poetic flight.His Bach and Prokoviev enclose a new vision, far from being absolute literal, he confers new perspectives of interpretation.Because of that, his Faure (The French Chopin) is so pristine and transparent.This is double album that should be part of your collection. Pitifully, by unexplainable reasons, Francois remains for many people an unknown pianist.Go for this rewarding album!"
3,Weak.,"The campaigns are okay (3 1/2 stars), but Skirmish is a joke. Easy mode is way too easy and Standard is almost impossible. There is not enough balance to the different races. I challenge anyone to try and beat the Skirmish mode with the Imperial Guard and the AI as the Orks at Standard difficulty. You will NEVER win. The new units are great if you can ever get to them. It takes for freakin ever to get your vehicles and by that time the AI has double what you have. You will spend the entire game on the defensive building endless amounts of ineffective turrets while facing waves and waves of his scouts that are just a tough as your expensive regulars. The IG is supposed to have numbers as one of it's ""strengths"", but you still start out with only 4 and have to spend a fortune to build them up in strength. It's the same with the Chaos Marines, and Eldar. The Space Marines is the only race you can pick in Skirmish mode and have a reasonable chance of victory. Disappointing."
2,awful campaign mode,"Why does relic spend so much effort and money developing such a sophisticated and exciting RTS platform and then give it a campaign mode that is just a confusing goatf$#k of massed enemies and nonsensical storylines? The game was designed to reward subtly matching unit types to enemy strategies, but the campaign mode is just a wave after wave of mixed units that must be endured with no time or even need to plan a defense. I feel like I've been given a set of surgical tools and then told I have 10 minutes to cut dow a tree with them; the sophistication of the tools makes the brutish nature of the task all the more frustrating. Bad, bad job relic."
5,Excellent,"I've been a big fan of the RTS game series Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War and I was very impressed by this expansion pack. If you've played the original Dawn of War then be prepared for a much tougher experience in this game. The campaign is basically separated between ""Order"" and ""Disorder"". You will play from four Factions, The Eldar, Chaos Space Marines, Orks, and the Imperial Guard. At the end of the game you'll get to see four endings, one for each faction that leads to the events of the sequel game Dark Crusade. Besides the game, the product arrived very fast, just within a few days of ordering it. It arrived and looked brand new as mentioned it would, with no damage or scratches to the two discs. Tough and challenging game but very cool."
4,Good Expansion for the Dawn of War Fan,"After playing this game, I saw that THQ did try to make a well made sequel to the original game, and in that they did. The story in the campaign was compelling and fun. The new race, Imperials that are now playable are not weak. The new units that are made proved to be great units on the battlefield. The only thing is the campaigns are short, maybe 6 levels long. And also, there is not much content that was released into this expansion. Overall if you are a fan of Dawn of war then dont hesitate to play this game"
2,Expansion Pack?,"Dawn of War was a great game. Winter Assault detracts from the gameplay in every respect besides the addition of the Imperial Guard.I wish I hadn't purchased this game, as the existing armies had multiple unit types, upgrades, and research removed from them. more was removed in fact, then was added.Avoid!"
3,dont see what all the hype is about,"Nothing special about this game that sets it apart from any other RTS. In fact, older RTS like command and conquer:generals have more features in game than this title. For instance, in C&C;:G you can garrison any civilian building. You can only garrison certain structures that you build in W40k:DOW, but you cant garrison civilian buildings.Is this game fun? Yes. Is it worth the $49.95 it cost for the game and the expansion? Not even close."
1,Game does not work.,"I bought this game because I enjoyed the original so much. But when I installed this game, I experienced multiple errors and difficulty installing it. Once I finally got it installed, the game doesn't start.http://forums.relicnews.com/showthread.php?t=73787That is the link to the relic forums where multiple people are having the same problems.Don't buy this game if you want to avoid wasting 3 hours of your time."
3,good cd,this cd has good christmas music with a salsa rhythm. this artist is great with awesome music to make you love it.
5,A must for hinging,This tape is fantastic. You have to be careful not to get it too wet but it is a must for archival framing.
3,Not bad overall,"I'm picked up this game for the fun of it. What I found was a 2d game with very simply drawn graphics which is still alot of fun to play. There are alot of games that you have to finish to get better bride's items. I still play it because it is fun to choose wedding stuff, and who doesn't like choosing wedding stuff?"
3,Very cute as an older player,I read the reviews and thought it would be light hearted fun and it was but it seems to be for a grade school child who just likes the idea of planning a wedding. I really wanted to design the dresses and cake. The choicese were limited for an adult player but it does have some really cool features- digitl scrapbooking elements and one ore two really cute mini games. Plan to give to a kid. They will love it.
1,Disappointed Daughter!!!!!!,"After this game was loaded into our computer, my daughter was able to play for about an hour. The game then froze up. Later, when she tried to play again, it wouldn't even load. I uninstalled the game from our computer and upon attempting to reinstall, NOTHING would happen. I'm certainly glad this piece of junk only cost me about $6.00; however, I still have a very sad daughter who had been very excited about playing this game!"
3,An okay game,"My daughter likes this game. However, to get all the choices you have to be able to master all the levels of all the games. There are two games that my children have trouble with and I end up having to play the hardest level for them so they can get all the choices to choose from for the wedding dress, flowers, rings, nails, hairstyles, etc. I have an 8 and 11 year old. My 11 year old is not interested in this game and my 8 year old plays it sometimes. She gets bored with it pretty quickly. There are many other computer games out there that are better and more educational and keeps my girls interest."
2,Not really what I wanted,"I was disappointed because when I first picked up the soundtrack, I thought it would include all the music in the film. The only reason I cared about the music in the film was that all the original score was composed by Kevin Manthei, my favorite modern music composer. He worked on several video game scores, as well as the award-winning soundtrack to the canceled cartoon ""Invader Zim."" None of his work in the film is on this, just a collection of artists I don't really care about. If there were an alternate soundtrack with Manthei's music on it, I'd buy it up in a flash, but since this was the only one it was a serious letdown."
3,"Some good stuff, but not a great package","I bought this for a few items, Rammstein in particular. I was also told it was a good gothic CD - NOT. It's a metal CD mostly, with a few other bits thrown in. I liked the other bits more, but even they were not all that. Marilyn is not Industrial and certainly not Goth. That's all right, MM has done some good work and I don't dislike Metal. It just didn't have the dark feel I was expecting. I also have to agree with other reviewers who said the CD doesn't have the flow and power the soundtrack had during the movie. It seems kind of watered down. Somewhere along the way some record company exec and marketing folks in khakis got involved and took out all the stuff that scared them. Hmmm, Evil that isn't scary? What's the point?"
3,Borderline-Great,"Way better than most soundtracks, this actually puts out some suitable music, rather than just hard tracks from nu metal popular bands. I still dislike Slipknot, but their mix of FIGHT SONG is brilliant.M.Manson composed one of the great, unrelenting industrial horror scores ever for this film, it's a shame Paul Anderson can't direct to save his life, that the script was disinteresting, and there was no horror. One of the worst films I've ever seen, actually."
4,Not bad,"Could have been better? Maybe.Still, nothing is that bad: if you like remixes, you'll have plenty of them here: Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Fear Factory, Mudvayne, and Ill Nino, i.e. most of your old friends mixed something new for you.If you love some songs by your favorite bands, they're on the cd, too: Adema (why not?), Rammstein (this track is missing on the regular version of Mutter), Depeche Mode (well..), Saliva (the good news), and Five Pointe O (one of the best tracks on the cd).Well, finally, the whole 18 tracks - will you ask for more? Even if you will, this one is not the worst soundtrack we've ever heard of, and easily worth buying."
2,"Would have been worth while if they had used only original music, but sadly...","I LOVED the main resident evil theme. That track alone earned the disk it's two stars. The very few other tracks that are actually the score from the film were also quite good. Unfortunately, most of the CD is dedicated to ""hey-lets-throw-some-metal-junk-to-cash-in-on-the-under-20-crowd!"" stuff. Most of it was neither featured in the movie, nor has ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE. Shame.Download the main theme, don't bother with the CD."
2,Sadly...,"...I can't give this a 5 star rating. Why? Because it's not what we *WANT*...namely the actual score from the movie. I was watching Resident Evil on DVD last night when it hit me again: the music from the *MOVIE* is GOOD. We get a tantalizing piece of the movie score with the last 4 tracks on this CD but it highlights how disappointing this CD is.That said, realize that my 2-star rating is punishment for not releasing the movie score. The regular songs on here are good but they do not fill the hole left by the lack of the movie score."
5,This Kicks!,"I think this Movie soundtrack is just great. I listened to it alot and really love those Marilyn Manson songs on it. All the other remixes sound awesome. If you enjoy techno/metal and all that good stuff I really recommand this album(!!)(if my english is bad, please hate me)"
2,"Good Score, then a bunch of pop metal","The score by Manson is worth buying the CD for. As for all the other songs, they're all censored and it's mostly a bunch of new popular so-called metal bands that don't sound very original to me. If you are displeased with the supposedly heavy music you see on MTV, then don't expect anything good from this CD except for the score and the Manson remix."
4,Why?? god Why?,great cd awsome choice of bands and songs but you CAN'T EDIT THIS CD ...!1 WHAT THE [HECK]? I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS EDITED BEFORE I BOUHGT IT SO IF YOU HATE EDITED CDS AS MUCH AS I DO WAIT FOR IT TO COME OIT UNEDITED. also the way they have the songs listed is wrong. they have the bands matched with the wrong songs on amazon. it really goes like this:1. slipknot2.slpiknot3.manson4.coal chamber5.?6.adema7.?beyond that i can't remember but its a good cd but why did they edit it they HAVE to release an unedited version soon or I will be very unhappy.
3,"Good, but not best...","Ok soundtrack featuring Marilyn Manson, Rammstein with more. Not perfect... Cool soundtrack to a very bad movie..."
5,Great Soundtrack. Even Edited,"I bought the soundtrack right after I went and saw the movie, which I am proud to say it [rocked]:) Marilyn Manson does a hell of a job on the last four tracks, which I listen to constantly, and the other songs are good also. There is one problem with it though, WHY EDIT IT?!? Besides of the editing, it still one hell of a soundtrack! If you like Marilyn Manson, Coal Chamber, Adema, The Crystal Method, and most of all, SLIPKNOT, then you will definitly love this soundtrack!!!!!!!"
3,Good CD...but edited!?,"This CD represents everything that Metal and rock has become. Slipknot, Manson and various other artists do justice to the music industry. There is only one thing missing that would make this one of the cds I'm most proud of owning...the edited out explatives. It is hard for me to get the full rage and emotion that these artists portray in thier music. I mean...Slipknot, Manson, and Ill Nino with out the cursing? To any true rock/metal fan that is on the verge of blasphemy. Manson brought this back from the dead though w/ his score. It seems eerie yet beutiful at the same time. The intro really sets the mood, and the choices for the type of movie is excellent. I wish I could find it un-edited though."
5,The best soundtrack of 2002 so far.,"This soundtrack is awesome. All the songs that where pickd are great, even the marilyn manson songs are good. Possibly the best song is The main Theme to Resident Evil. This track just captures your attention plus its got a real creepy vibe to it. Other great songs by Slipknot, fear factory, espicially the new Coal chamber song t kicks...All the songs are good and it really is a great soundtrack to a good movie."
5,"Just like the movie, intense and terrifyingly cool!","I knew this CD was going to be good from the get-go. I can kind of compare this CD to the soundtrack of ""Queen of the Damned"" which you can buy with this disc off this wonderful website. The music is dark, edgy and grunge filled. Even though, I don't like Marilyn Manson personally, he did the best job with the music score he incorporated scary musical overtones with grungy, driving electric guitars, with the little dance beat of the keyboards. I think this and Queen of the Damned, both have great music soundtracks, and should both be bought at the same time, for multiple enjoyment. One of the best parts on this CD is the opening of the little girl saying ""You're All Going To Die Down Here"", then you hear the machine-gun drums of Slipknot's ""My Plague""! If you're still reading this:BUY THIS CD, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,LOL,"I'm sorry...but I just have to laugh at you Flanders. When you refered to the Depeche Mode song, you said that they were some ""static-x wannabes who don't no what metal is"" Ummm...first of all, Depeche Mode has been around for over 20 years...so they could hardly be ""static-x wannabes"" Nor have they ever been metal, claimed to be metal or tried to be metal...it's freakin' Depeche Mode! Gawd, you must be very young. LOL"
3,Not completely satisfied,The album itself is great. The music itself is great. I'm an adult and don't care for my music being edited of content. Some language was removed from certain songs on the album. The edited songs detract from the overall listining experience!!!
2,You LIE!!!!,"Normally this album would have received a perfect 5 star rating except for one little tiny detail. THE SONGS ARE EDITED/CENSORED WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT!!!! I should have read the reviews before buying this album. Dont get me wrong, the songs are all awesome! Its just...there edited =["
3,Review for Resident Evil,"The Music is from the motion picture Resident Evil. The music does not stray from the movie, in fact the music is what is exactly in the movie"
3,Resident evil,I was happy when I got the album but very disapointed when I realised that only four score tracks was on soundtracks was from the real score! I am sure that most people like the score tracks alot and if anyone knows how to get the score album (if there is any) then write me at platin666@hotmail.com
3,Manson's score....,"I have to agree with one of the other people who wrote a review on this CD, Marilyn's score from the film on this disc is worth the price of admission alone, save for the typical cliched nu-metal sludge and the one electronic track from the Crystal Method. Manson's score tracks for the film remind me a lot of Richard Devine's work, but Manson's have a bit more of a concrete, orchestrated feel to them, not as chaotic as Devine's music. Shoot, maybe Manson & Devine should do a collaboration, they both sound like they're on the right track, IMHO..."
3,Resident Evil (Biohazard Remix)*,"Really good CD. Problem is the cussing on the CD is up a bit and some people (like me) well don't like words tossed around during a song. I bought the CD and the songs are good musically, but the edited...takes the lyrics hard to hear (Method Man - Realease Yo delf (prodigy mix)) The other tracks are good...includes: Slipknot, Mudvayne, Marilyn Manson, Adema, Fear Factory, Static-X, The Crystal Method, Rammstein, Saliva, Depeche Mode, Ill Nino, Five Point O, and Method Man. Really neat remixes and great sound for the tense movie itself, could have been better. I was less impressed than now than I was waiting for the soundtrack. It advertised Slipknot. Great for Censory and Metal."
4,Frontline Assembly in Credits,"Frontline Assembly is in the credits, because in one scene(around when Alice is fighting the dogs or has the memory recall in the lab), you can hear the intro to Existance, a song off of Epitaph. One of my favorite FLA songs.= chiisu"
1,Music to sell not from the heart,"All there's to be said about the recent soundtrack to this movie and this previous original is ? Not from the heart but only to sell. Im sick of these fake and poser bands like killswitch engage,slipknot etc... Making kids think they listining to real metal and their not but this is false matel ats it gets. I like to see who ever put this soundtrack together choose real deathmetal acts like cannibal corpse,deicide,cryptopsy on the soundtrack, no ? That's because you guys can't handle real music with technicality,heavyness, and, brutality. Keep your false poser metal and i'll stick to my real metal. Posers? Have fun! Real metalheads? Don't waste your money on this poison."
3,OK!,"It is neat to have the original script to this knockout musical. It is set up like the ""Peanuts"" comic books. Nostalgic to say the least!"
4,Prepares every physician to face this field of specialty,"Everything on sexually transmitted infections and AIDS isdiscussed here. From epidemiology, the basics, the disease entitiesin concise presentations, to managing these infections in the primary health care level and control of infections. Special topics are included as well, which make the textbook an ideal tool in mastering and studying sexually transmitted infections. Written by respected leaders in the field, this book definitely is a must in the library of anyone interested in the field."
2,A great plot with a very boring script.,"I had never seen ""The Mark of the Rani"" before I bought it. I first seen its sequel ""Time and the Rani"" on PBS when I was a kid and loved it, and still do to this day. That's why I bought ""The Mark of the Rani"", but unlike ""Time"", ""Mark"" is very boring to sit through. The actors are excellent - even Colin Baker through most of the story. The special effects are pretty good. The production values shine, and even the plot is good. It's just the script itself. It's very much lacking in action and excitement. I had a hard time sitting through it. And part one's cliffhanger is a joke. But still it does have things to offer as I pointed out earlier which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. But over all, it's not really that great.Not recommended."
2,Tree-mendous!,"About now it was becoming increasingly obvious that no-one working on Dr.Who (with the possible exception of Colin Baker who could have been - and wanted to be! - so much better) had a clue how to tell a good Dr.Who story. There's a definite sense of 'Hey, here's a nice location, let's string a feeble story around it!' about this meandering tale of over-acting Time Lords (all three of them) and unconvincing historical shenanigans. Pip and Jane's script is a stinker, the visual FX are half-hearted and the noted thesps in supporting roles (Terence Alexander, Gawn Grainer, Peter Childs) have the good grace to look seriously embarrassed. Garbage, quite frankly."
2,The Rani is introduced as a new villian for the Doctor!,"The only good things in this episode is a introduction to the Rani, a female time lord rougue like the Doctor and the Master! If you are a die hard Colin Baker or fan of the series in general buy this video! It features the Master who makes his last appearence in the serial ""The Trial of A Time Lord"" . The outfit Peri wears is OK , but why could Lord Ravensworth give her more clothes in that era!"
4,Very Little To Not Like,"Some folks are highly critical of what has been come to be known as ""Popera"". However, for someone like me, who likes the music but hates to sit and watch fat people screeching at one another, Katherine Jenkins is just perfect. She's unbelievably easy on the eyes, and she can sing with great power or great sweetness, as the occasion requires. The choice of tracks here is slightly uneven - I got the feeling that it was a put together from tracks that didn't make in on her other albums. No matter - it's great to have them as fillers. The final measure for me is that listening to these songs makes me happy, and I consequently want to do so over and over. If you like beautiful soprano voices, you need to buy this album. You will definitely not be disappointed."
1,Absolutely Awful:The Low Rent Billy Ray Cyrus.,"I bought this album because Ray Wilson was in Genesis for a time. He sang on their album ""Calling All Stations"". I quite liked his voice and was interested to see what he could do on his own.Well the answer is not very much. This guy has no songwriting talent at all, lyrics that sound like they were written by a drunk in a bar: ""poor me"" etc. Tuneless rubbish.It is amazing that the producer on the Genesis album managed to get the performance that he did out of this low rent Billy-Ray Cyrus."
3,So-so,"As soon as this expansion was released, some peeps went out and ""bought"" thousands, if not millions of Tribute points with the lowest of the low items and platinum. SOE ""fixed"" the problem so that now, you get less for more that you must pay. SOE also says they intend to ""limit"" the number of Tribute points each character may have. Enough said about points. As for the leadership ability, it's helpful, but...like AAs, you will need to divert experience away in order to apply points to leadership. The new zones are so-so and loads of 60's (mostly topped) characters were in them on Rodcet Nife, anyway. I don't have any characters quite that high, but I would imagine that there are many items only available in those new places, just like the planes. Get this if you are topped and bored, if new, I would wait until leveling to at least 55."
4,Fact not fiction,Just to clear up a few things. First the leadership exp does not take away from leveling or AA exp. That said the expansion is mainly for very high level (read 65th) with tons of good gear and AA. The items being droped by mobs in the deeper zones rivals and quit often beat time gear. The tribut system is not worth the cost but can be a big help in major fights. The trade skill system is worth it by its self. All in all the new zones are not for the meek:). It will allow a single group that works hard to get into time or better gear without being time flaged and that is the MAIN reason I give it four stars.
2,buggy and rushed,"its new, its buggy, and it feels undeveloped. The new berserker class added in this expansion has features that are obviously broken. trade skill items are there, but of little use to anyone able to explore the content."
1,Dont waste your money,You need to be level 65 and in a high end raiding guild to do anything in this expansion. It is very buggy. Do not waste your time and money.
3,Keeping in Arms,"Story 44 feature season 6 episodes one through five. It's a big gap from episode 37, so feel free to feel a bit lost."
3,The fall of the dominators,"One can't help but wish that since so many of the pivotal and brilliant episodes of Doctor who are missing, it was possible to trade this one in for some of them. The Dominators themselves have evidently conquered their empire by overacting, and frightening people with corny costumes. The Quarks are possibly the cheesiest robots ever to appear on the show. It's okay, but not one of the highlights of Troughton's career."
3,NOT A SCOFIELD CD BY ANY MEANS,This is NOT a Scofield cd and should not be listed and sold as such. Dayna Stephens is an excellent young player who should be heard on his own merit - but he chose to give Scofield unauthorized and unwelcomed credit and exploited him to the max with this recording.
4,meh,"Its an ok cd if you like Anti-Flag. His lyrics are catchy, very much like Anti-Flag's. If your really looking for a better punk rock cd, pick up any one of Anti-Flag's cd's, preferably ""A New Kind of Army"" or ""Die For Your Government"" which are both phenominal cd's. Preaty much this cd is just Anti-Flag minus the drums and bass."
4,"""Kinda"" good, as a whole...","An episode that brings in elements of Buddhist mythology and Milton's Paradise Lost as the Doctor and his companions explore the mystery of an alien force threatening natives and colonists on the primitive world of Deva Loka. Good performances by Peter Davison, Janet Fielding, and Richard Todd make this an enjoyable tale; only real letdowns are the cheap monster at the end, and the fact that there is too much Adric and too little Nyssa. An above-average Davison episode."
5,Billy Ocean,Love Billy Ocean music. Listened to it in the 80's and I still love to listen to it. Excellent CD!
1,RIPPED OFF,"I would never use cd imports again.When I received my original ordered item,I opened an empty cd case.I sent it back with a note explaining my predicament,and have not heard back from Cd Imports,its now been one month since I sent it back."
2,OK For $ .99,"The main two female characters behave in constant unfiltered thought/emotion/action dangerous behavior that becomes annoying rather than amusing. At this price, I don't mind having bought this title, but I won't buy more of the series."
1,Not a good read,the author takes too long to get to any conclusion in the story. The book could have been about half the size it was. She kept trying to make it a mystery with lots of turns and plots but did not work. Would not buy again from this author.
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I really wanted to like this book, but it was just mediocre. Nothing was horrible, but it just moved a bit too slowly, with characters just a bit too dull for me. The author failed to draw me into the story so that I wanted to know more about ""who"" and ""why"". I did get about halfway through before I realized there were better ways to spend my time."
1,Boring.,This book was so bad I finally just deleted it. I read about 3 chapters hoping it would get better...but was so boring it was hard for me to keep my interest.
2,Detective Story,"I did not finish this book. It is not my choice of reading. I do not like drawn out diagolue. I do not like ""girlie"" detective stories."
4,Good Reading,"I enjoyed this book and was surprised with the ending. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery and wants to solve it with the character. I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end and I could just imagine the main character, Leigh, in her many different circumstances from the awful dinner at her mother's to the search in the house."
5,Good mystery,"Never guessed the ending. Some parts didn't ring true or logical, like an old woman catching another woman off a roof."
2,Never Buried,"I am always looking for inexpensive fiction with good reviews and this author had a series with relatively good reviews. Although I enjoy most mysteries, I did not enjoy this book. I had gotten the impression that it was a ""humorous mystery,"" but, for me, it was trite and boring. I liked the potential for two cousins involved in investigations, but the husband's distance and then interference toward the end was annoying. Presumably the next Leigh Koslow mysteries will improve - since this was the first - but I think I will pass."
2,"slow start, gripping middle section and abrupt climax","The book had a really dry and slow start with some excitement and too much detail of character background. But once that crossed, the mid section was fast and gripping with a lot excitement, suspense and making you want to absolutely know what happens next. But when the climax reaches, it all happens quickly and leaves you wanting for more, especially with the build up in the middle.The author also interchanges the main characters first name and last name somewhere in the middle, was kind of confusing.Overall an ok-ok read if you do not have nothing else to read."
5,Great read,"I really enjoyed this book. Well written, good plot, with a twist at the end. Love that it was free, but I would have paid for it!"
3,I was surprised I finished it.,"I hate to give up on a book; but this one was really difficult for me to get through to the end...again, in my opinion. It was slower than S-L-O-W. The 2 main characters were likeable, but that's about it. It just dragged on with a collage of detailed meaningless muck that just wasn't interesting...again, in my opinion. I was happiest when it ended because a page turner it is not. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,CUTE!!,This book was a lot of fun to read and kept me laughing and guessing! Characters were interesting and fun to get to know!
4,Never a dull moment,"This was a page turning, fast, fun read. Not perfect, but perfect for the beach, waiting in an airport, or just hanging out at home on the couch on a hot afternoon. I read the sample and was hooked, it didn't disappoint me, it didn't bog down, the pace was good and it came to a satisfactory ending."
3,"Nice, nothing offensive","Leigh and Cara are , enjoyable youthful, Nancy Drew comes to mind. This book is not cluttered with sex, drugs, blood etc. STILL KEEPS YOUR interest."
4,Interesting and satisfying.....I recommend,"Not only did this book grab my attention right from the beginning, it was clever, and different. I enjoyed it, although sometimes it was hard to follow. Still a good read, don't hesitate to get it!!!"
3,Slow,This book took too much time to get really exciting. There was not enough action to excite me. The characters were too predictable.
3,A surprise villain,The story moves a bit slow at times. The characterization did not make me feel like I knew the people. It had an almost unbelievable ending.
4,Entertaining,"Quick read, very entertaining. I will read more from Claire! I usually figure out the mystery long before the end, and this one kept me guessing."
4,Good book,Even tho I haven't finished it yet I am enjoying itIt was a little slow at the start but got into the characters and story shortly
3,Never Buried,I found this book pretty good but it was a bit difficult to follow the author's thoughts at times. The ending for me was pretty predictable.
3,"The plot's a bit far-fetched, but it's worth a read",Light-hearted and fast moving... well enough to want to keep reading. The plot was a bit far-fetched but the author has done a good job to keep the reader guessing till almost the end.
4,Fun Read,"Sometimes you don't want to read something heavy. Sometimes you just want something a little fun. Never Buried by Edie Claire is like the best junk food. It's sweet, fun and entertaining.The characters are fleshed out, the story is cute and suspenseful at the same time.I love the way the small town was described and sort of want to live there myself!It's a great first book and I'm glad I was able to grab it while it was free.I just purchased Never Sorry and I can't wait to visit with Leigh and the rest of the gang again."
4,can't beat the price,I read this on my kindle fire as a free book. It was fun and enjoyable. Quick paced with vibrant characters. The were a few holes in the plot which are easily forgiven. The free price makes this a no loss situation. I liked the author's style enough to buy the next book in the series.
4,Appealing cozy mystery,"The author writes well, the key characters are well drawn, the rather distinctive puzzler made to seem reasonable and the story-line interesting. This is an effective inducement to continue the series which is already begun on Kindle. While this (at the moment) carries the 99 cent price tag, the others are at 2.99. Even at that price they are still a bargain in terms of the pleasure of reading them. Leigh Koslow, the author, has managed to create interesting sets of ambivalent relationships among those in the heroines family circle. Always human these relationships are never entirely comfortable, yet not bitter. A good and entertaining book to sit down with."
3,Simple and Enjoyable,"This is what I like to call a ""beach book"". It's perfect for whiling away the hours as you soak up some rays, but might not be something to bother with on your lunchbreak. Set in Pittsburgh, a decades-old backyard mystery unfolds and the main character, Leigh, decides to solve it. It's a basic mystery novel, no frills or extremely creative twists."
4,Never Buried,I thought the story line was very interesting. The only thing I didn't like was that the story skipped around from place to place a lot.
3,Never Buried,Ok book to read for the price. I had trouble keeping up with the many characters. Just too many. The plot was interesting enough though.
5,Never Buried,"Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Good characters, lots of action in this story. If you like to be on the edge of your seat, I recommend this Amazon book."
3,Never Buried,Good read. Enjoyed meeting a new sleigh. I thought it took a little while to get story going but once on track it moved right along. I hope in the later stories the main character gets it together.
3,Interesting,I found this book interesting but a little unbelievable. I think I may try another one by this author before I make a final decision .
4,Great beach reading,"I loaded up my iPad with Kindle books before heading to the beach for a week. This was the first book I read and it was perfect--not filled with so many characters that I couldn't keep them straight, and still had enough plot to keep me interested."
5,AWESOME BOOK,"This book is awesome, I read a little bit every day before class, and I just can't put it down. Books have a hard time keeping my attention but not this one, I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone! I just totally loved the book and hopefully I will be able to read the rest of the books! Job well done on such and awesome book!!"
4,NEVER BURIED,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Greatstory line that keeps you guessing to the very end. I could not put the book down; I read the book in one day.
4,Glad I Chose it,"At first this novel seemed, for me, to start out with too much happening with too many characters coming at me, but then it settled into a nice pace. I became totally involved with the characters and began caring about them. The author wrote well enough for me to start making a mental list of ""who dunnit"" and why. Nice surprise ending."
2,Not very good,Unfortunately this book isn't as good as I had hoped it would be. The characters aren't well fleshed out & the mystery isn't hard to figure out.
2,Never buried by Edie Claire,Enjoyed the character. Felt the story did not flow . Plot was good but moved slow. I will try her next book before final judgment.
2,Okay for a Free Book,"It tried too hard. Really? An unburied dead body showing up in your pregnant cousin's hammock? Could it possibly work the ""I'm so quirky"" angle harder? I think not."
3,[?] editing problems,"There were quite a few editing problems = odd question marks in brackets, throughout the book. [?] The mystery itself was good. I didn't see the end coming."
3,Never Buried,Worth the reading. Nice plot with great twists. Looking forward to reading more from the author Edie Claire. Recommend the book
5,NEVER would have seen this coming....,"I'm not a great ""who-dun-it"" fan, since I don't like getting bogged down in a lot of details when I read, but this is a FUN read, without story over-development, and absolutely wonderful characters! If I don't connect with the character within the first 10 pages, then I'm not likely to finish the book.This one grabs you by the horns immediately and doesn't let go until the end.And I never would have figured the culprit out, so very very well written Edie Claire. I look forward to reading what else Leigh gets drawn into.BTW...I read the first story because it was a FREEBIE (just got my first Kindle in Jan2012). I swore that I wasn't going to purchase any books for a long time, since there are so many free titles to be read yet, but for this series I'm going to have to fork over the $$ because I'm so in love with the characters...and I do so LOVE a good series! Keep 'em coming Edie..."
4,Milhone/Plum-ish,"This is the first of five books (so far) in the Leigh Koslow series. The characters and family interactions remind me of a cross between Kinsey Milhone and Stephanie Plum. The heroine, Leigh, is as fiercely independent as those two other leading ladies, and the predicaments she finds herself in are just as far-fetched and sometimes unrealistic, but it makes for lively reading. In this particular book, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the plot doesn't quite make sense in terms of why the killer waited so long to destroy the evidence, and the author doesn't provide enough detail and history to help astute readers solve the mystery. However, I found the characters and writing compelling enough to purchase all five books in the series. I enjoyed them a great deal and would like to see the author continue with more books featuring Leigh Koslow."
3,Nice easy read,"The characters are likable and the writing flows pretty well. The plot was a little forced and convoluted but this is a first book so okay. I have no major gripes--it is what it claims to be--a light, series mystery."
4,Great book,I really enjoyed trying to figure out who don it...recommended reading for people who enjoy a good mystery novel for real
4,NEVER BURIED,I LOVE MYSTERIES! This one is very entertaining-my first by Edie Claire!! I look forward to reading more OF HER work.
3,its okay.,"it was decent read, i've read far worse easy going and written well. what can i say didnt cost me anything."
3,pretty average,"and wont bother reading anymore in the series, glad it was a free download! didnt really get the story and felt parts didnt completely make sense, almost like the author didnt quite know where to go with it or how to end it."
4,Very good read,I just stumbled across Ms. Claire's books.... this is the second of hers that I have read and find them very enjoyable. I will be purchasing more.
4,Never Buried,"Edie Claire has given her readers an enjoyable cast of characters. The mystery is easily solved, but enjoyable reading. More enjoyable for women readers. Heavy female presences in the book."
1,just about ok,I hate to say this but the only reason i finished this book is because I started and hate to quit before the end .Sorry not for me.
1,Stomach-turning opening. Too much for me.,"I settled down with my dinner and selected this book on my iPad--and was treated to a long, disgusting, all-five-senses description of a cat vomiting.Okay, this is a series cozy--my all-time favorite kind of book to read.But if this is the author's idea of a good way to introduce me to her sleuth--count me out. Out. Out. Out.I gave it 1 star because as far as I can tell, the entire book is made up of a damn cat throwing up.The end."
2,Nerver Buried,"I don't know whether it's me, but I'm not prepared to re-read the book to find out whether I missed the solution to some loose ends or whether the author didn't tie all of them. My suspension of disbelief was stretched thin."
2,Slow read,"Kind of boring. Never did finish it. It did not hold my attention for long, and I went on to something else."
2,dissenter,"this is a first book and it shows. it reads as if it is written for children. i hate humorous murder myteries. after all,a person has lost their life. that is nothing to joke about."
3,Summer Reading,"The author got off to a clunky start about being woken to the sound of her cat barfing. But she finds her stride by the second chapter and the book turned out better than I had expected. Some of the secondary characters aren't very well fleshed out (Maura, Leigh's best friend, is either gruff and bear-like or friendly or vulnerable). Halfway through the story, Leigh's college friend, Warren, a politically aspiring young man, becomes another supporting character, but also not well developed.The format of 30 year old women with lots of free time becoming accidental detectives is quite the rage lately, complete with humorous mother/daughter issues, so the concept is hardly unique.,There are some questions that don't ever get answered, but the who-done-it is a surprise. Besides, who wouldn't want to find secret compartments in their old house?I wouldn't re-read this but I'd recommend it to a friend who likes light detective stories."
3,Just a time filler,"I was hoping to get into a good mystery; this is not a page turning ""can't put it down"" read. There was never any real suspense; a boring and predictable read."
4,Fun read,"The book was entertaining, which is what a light novel should be. The characters are interesting and likable. The plot was well developed."
4,Pleasant surprise!,"Good plot, it kept me turning pages. I love mysteries and I was even surprised by the twist at the end!"
5,Get IT!,I am normally more of a romance / erotica reader but this was an addictive read that I just couldn't put down. As soon as I was done with this one I went online and got the rest of them. Definitely worth your time. :D
3,Pretty good mystery.,"Not a bad story but didn't find the characters very attractive overall. Pretty much figured out the ending, but it was ok."
1,A so--so book not living up to the hype,"When I first bought this book, I could not wait to read it. Unfortunately the book is more hype than anything else. At times I felt like I should spend a day in the library reading articles on microfiche and saved the money I spent.It is sad since I have heard the authors in Paris many, many times and now I feel like I was cheated. It is a shame."
1,Overpowering Smell,The smell to this was extremely overpowering! The only fragrance that came through was the patchouli. I guess if that's what you like & are looking for...this is your body oil.
4,good protection but wrong colour,"I am Korean with medium beige skin. So I ordered ""perfectly clear"" and to disappointmet, it was very orangey and looked unatural. I have ""all clear"" so luckily I managed to combine 4 shakes of all clear with 3 shakes of perfectly clear; it matches my skin lightness but definitly not the colour. I suggest using any colour as a base to your makeup. Although the powder is very powdery, (fine particles fly everywhere) it is better than using the other mineral spf out there. ( more natural and good coverage)"
5,"""Memory"" and ""identity"" are key words","One reviewer comments, in part, ""The church needs a pope to bring the Catholic belief system into the new world."" This is not possible if the Catholic Church is to remain faithful to its mission as entrusted to it by the Church's creator, Jesus, through Peter and his successors. The Church has a ""memory"" of nearly 2000 years and the dogma established by Christ; dogma cannot be changed; the belief system cannot be changed; truth cannot be changed. That is the Church's ""identity:"" the unchanging truth. Each era has a ""new world;"" truth and dogma cannot change with each new world, or it would not be the truth. Whomever the pope is, he cannot change truth."
2,Not written for most tastes.,"I am a practicing Catholic and have great respect for the Pope and the Church, however...This book is kind of dull.It is a philosophy book, like the kind that bored you to tears in college or high school.In lieu of this purchase, I recommend the Pontiff's biography, or donating the money on Sunday to Peter's Pence(which is the Pope's discretionary fund)."
4,"Flawed, though vibrant","John Paul was not only the pope, he began as a Scottish playwright before he won being pope. To understand this man you must read his earlier style as a scriber of words and spoken dialect. Poland was his birthplace, and he worked a miricle about his friend, fatty. Then he became pope, for many generations."
5,Vermont Encyclopedia is an excellent book,The book was perfect for browsing before my vacation. It came quickly and was in good condtion.
3,Lack of an index makes this much less useful,"This is well-written and informative. However, it's very hard to use the book for research because it doesn't have an index; it doesn't even have ""see also"" cross-references in the articles! There's no way to get at much of the information in the book. For instance--I know that there were skirmishes between Vermonters and Canadians in the 19th century because I read the article ""Patriots, or les Patriotes."" Then I'm stuck, because there's no cross-references to specific battles, individuals, or concepts in other articles. Another example: I'm researching a town called Shoreham, but the article ""Shoreham"" doesn't mention William J. Anderson, a black legislator from the town. There's no way to tell from ""Shoreham"" that there's an article ""Anderson, William J."" elsewhere in the book. This is too bad--the encyclopedia is otherwise really attractive."
2,Ho-Hum,"It was a documentory, not one complete song on the entire dvd, it was interesting but I would not purchase again was hoping for some music"
3,Good value...Not great,"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter. The real ""plus"" here is that this set is a great value -- 3 games in one package.The ""Artist"" game is by far our dauther's favorite. It has a lot of different activities, including making your own movie. The ""teaching"" component mostly consists of very basic instructions about lines and shapes.The ""A,B,C"" disc has a few games related to the alphabet that introduces the child to the letters. It also has some songs that aren't really very interactive.The ""1,2,3"" disc is, well, to put it mildly, dumb. There are only 3 different games -- matching numbers (which is sadly the most interesting game), matching quantities (gets kinda tedious after a while), the last one involves maneuvering a dog around to find objects in a sequence (unfortunately, the dog doesn't always go where you tell him).Overall, don't buy these games because you think they will make your kid smart. Just buy them for fun."
1,didn't stick for me.,"Tried to use this on tarp material... the stuff sticks to itself but the tape didn't stick at all to the tarp. Maybe it's not made for that, and might stick to other stuff. But didn't work for me."
1,Garbage!!,"I bought this with the idea that it is ""industrial strength"" thus it would be strong to hold in place a piece of carpet over a piece of rubber.No such thing!! It did not stick to the rubber, to the underneath of the carpeting made of another type of rubber,did not work either. I made sure that everything was cleanwith no dirt or cleaner residue, it did not make a difference, I had to end up buying krazy glue to make sure that one piece stuck to the carpet. Wasted mymoney. Frankly, it is hard to believe. Do not waste your money, try something else."
5,Great product!,"I used this velcro to stop the slats in my bed from falling loose, and to mount a few small speakers to the bed frame (Redneck it!). I bump into these speakers every day and have, after a month, YET to have ANY falls. I absolutely recommend it.It was very easy to cut into smaller strips as well."
3,"Not great, not horrible either","I got this product in order to re due my effects board for my guitar rig, the Velcro that came with it was worthless and i couldn't get it to lay flat on some pedals witch kept making the fall when i had to move them in the case. That being said,i thought that the glue would hold to the pedals and would keep the pedals stationary when moving them. After wiping down the bottom of the pedals with alcohol to make sure the Velcro adheres to a clean surface, i applied it to the board, the glue was not strong enough to hold the pedals down so the pedal would just rip away from the glue on the Velcro. I will say this in contrast the Velcro does hold good to itself, but i think they need to invest in some better grade glue."
5,Perfect for my needs,"Just the thing!, February 21, 2013ByRuth Ann KigerI ordered this because I have leg wraps and they were getting where the velcro would not stick to the fabric as good as needed. I put stuck these to the fabric creating a place where the Velcro would have to be in touch with Velcro instead of fabric, and worked perfectly. I got industrial strength because I wanted the sticky side to be strong enough to stay in place. Good product!"
5,Way to go Dixie!,"My heart went out to the dear little old ladies, but mind control freak jumpstarted my adrenaline! Love the Gypsy Filchers, and Dixie is as always, my hero!"
2,Chill Factor,"I read the first two books in this series and liked them. This book was terrible. If this is the way she is going to continue writing, she may want to consider retiring, now!"
2,Not very realistic,"Didn't manage to finish the book. Rogers lost me at her descriptions of the ""Granny Bandits."" They sounded more like women in their 80's than their 60's. She needs to get out of her office more and see real people. I'm in my 60's, volunteer at the Police Department, shoot pistols in competition, race cars, drive a Jaguar and run maratheons. And, I'm pretty typical."
3,Six Salsas and How to Use Them,"I am somewhat disappointed with this book,but I will keep the six salsa recipes, and will try the recipes which are similar to dishes I have enjoyed in Mexico, but where is that ONE BOOK; the one that includes all the salsas: fresh, cooked, roasted, mild, hot, red green, yellow, black?This is NOT that book, but it IS a thoughtful book; one worth reading.I don't have room in my cookbook library for a book that covers so little ground, so I will take what I like from it and pass it on."
3,More salsa recipes please,"I am a fan of Bayless earlier cookbooks and I love his TV show, but I was a little disappointed with this book. I bought it hoping to learn some new salsa recipes, but the book is more about dishes that are made with the 4 or so salsas that he teaches us at the beginning. Authentic Mexican is a much better book."
3,patient or pretender,"The book is kind of graphic, which doesn't really appeal to me, but it is interesting for those who want to learn more about factitious disorders."
4,Playing Sick,"I work in the emergency room of a very busy hospital so I get to see everyone who comes in. After a while you get to know who the ""regulars"" are. It becomes very frustrating because you know these people are faking it. They are wasting our nurses & doctors time while people in the waiting room sit and wait for hours on end with real problems.But you can't turn people away. Whether someone is faking it or not, they have to be seen.There is a psychological condition in which a person knowingly fakes an illness by simulating symptoms of a serious disease. The purpose? To attract attention. These patients, some of whom actually make themselves ill, seem to become sick in order to achieve such gains as emotional fulfillment, sympathy, and power over their doctors and their family and friends.I recommend this book to everyone who works in the healthcare system because I'm sure you have seen these types of cases before. Excellent read!"
2,Poor lack-luster offering,"Jon Pertwee was easily the most 'beleivable'Doctor, and as such, is my favorite. So Iwas really disappointed by this 'effort' fromthe bbc. Most of this tape consists of wholeepisodes taken from three of Pertwee's best - thereis little from the Man himself, unfortunately, andone can't help feeling it was a waste of time whenall is said and done.No interviews, and very little in terms of 'bestmemories' from Jon. Perhaps it was Mt. Pertweehimself who wasn't in a mind to go all out for this,I don't know, but I can only recommend this to thediehard Pertwee fan. There is an alternative takeon the theme which is interesting (and kinda scarey,and a few minutes of Pertwee showing off the Whomobile).Pertwee deserved a better tribute than this...."
3,A good video...,I enjoyed this video. The only drawback that I saw to it was that it featured mostly bits and pieces of episodes. I would have liked to have seen more behind the scenes and interviews with the casts (Jon Pertwee...Katy Manning...Elisabeth Sladen...Nicholas Courtney...)
1,"I'd Rather Cry,This Book Was So Bad.","I've never written a review on any book I've ordered before, but this one is so bad, I had to.This is not a book, it's a long therapy session for a very sick person. The way she talks about her mother is disgusting, her mother was a mentally ill person, and Linda felt the best way to treat her was to punch her in the face? She is so hostile and angry, and it shows on every page. Linda Richman needs the help, not us. How this woman ever got this book published is beyond me. She should pay US for reading the book. I would like to return it, because I certainly wouldn't lend it to anyone I consider a friend. You can reduce the price, but you can't reduce the harm that comes from reading a book like this. Linda Richman, you should be ashamed of yourself."
5,LINDA IS A GEM,"i just saw the oprah winfrey show and linda richman was a guest. I couldn't have been happier to finally attach a face with the writer of this very touching, funny book. Oprah is know for picking winners and this book is a winner! I love to laugh but sometimes find i can't when things are happening in my life. After i read this book i can honestly tell you that i've been doing things wrong. I was shown how to laugh in the face of crisis and come out stronger in the end. Linda found how to laugh when life isn't so funny and she helped me see that i can do it too. Bless you Linda and keep writing."
5,"I'd ""Most Certainly"" Rather Laugh","I have recently read a most wonderful and heartfelt book,""I'd Rather Laugh"", by Linda Richman. Linda opens her innermost self in such a way, that you can almost sense what she must have been feeling. One can see her pick herself up and go on, enjoying life, with all its adversities. This book was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. My only complaint, would be that it read to fast. LINDA RICHMAN, MY HATS OFF TO YOU, YOUR ONE AMAZING LADY. Wishing you all the best that life has to offer, and always keep laughing."
5,Yeah -- A Definite FIVE STAR!,"My wife bought this book after she saw the author on the Today Show. She read it in one sitting and when she was done she told me I had to read it. I didn't want to but I've been going through some stuff and figured why not. All I can say is, after reading this book, my problems seemed so small. I realized that no matter what, if you have a positive attitude your gonna be okay. Linda Richman deserves a medal. Thank you."
5,"""I'd Rather Laugh""","Linda Richman's inspirational biography is a must read. When I started to read this book I was crying and then I realized I was laughing..Linda's truth about how she views life and it's sadness is an enlightening journey to survival...Life sure did dole out it's share of horror to Linda..We have all experienced at least some or may be all of what she has lived. I felt as though I were sitting across from her, sharing a cup of coffee. I felt as though I knew her as a friend. I shall reread this book many times, her words are wisdom and truth.."
5,I'D RATHER LAUGH,"I would recommend this book to anyone who has gone through (or is going through) the hardships of life and still has not found their way out. Linda has a wonderful and funny way of helping us with almost everything that life brings us.She has been to hell and back and she can still laugh. She had me in tears and also laughing so hard, I thought my sides would split. But most of all, she made me think about how I live my life and how I handle all the problems that come my way. It's more than just a self-help book, it's her life story and it's one very good read.Do yourself a big favor today. Buy the book. You will laugh and cry, but you will also learn so much about yourself too."
5,I'm laughing too!,"Like Linda I've experienced the loss of a child-two in fact, in a car accident. I've arrived at a point where I too can laugh but I am enjoying the journey much more with Linda. This book is the perfect reality check for just how well you're doing and how you can try a little harder. It's for everyone, not just those who have experienced a tragedy. My advice-""Get this book, Read this book, Share this book."" Thank you Linda, it's been great reading your thoughts, advice, and sharing your humor."
2,"I liked it, but ...","I feel like the Grinch of all time for saying this, but Linda Richman is really not that funny. Mike Meyers based The Coffee Tawk Lady on her, but it's Mike Meyers that's funny, not his muse. So if you're looking for someone who can make you laugh out loud through your tears, I suggest you look elsewhere. That said, her advice was sound. Her heart is good, her tips are wise and accessible, and she seems like she has a good heart. But sorry, she's not a laugh riot. And her wisdom, while sincere and hard-earned, was not all that insightful."
1,"Good Book, Cosimo Classics=Bad Translation","I bought the Cosimo Classics edition of ""on the fourfold root"" (its the pink one) and basically there is on major problem with this copy, there are entire passages that Schopenhauer uses from other philosophers that are left completely untranslated, rendering null any ability to make sense of an already not too easy volume (that is of course unless you know latin, french, german, etc...)"
5,sheer poetry,"This book blends wisdom, insanity, tenderness, and adventure to highlight the most colorful aspects of human nature. I was captivated by Scott's intricate crafting of the English language and engulfed by the savage yet elegant execution of this novel. A true work of art."
5,When others just don't make the cut...,"If you're like me, then you may have a problem with condoms slipping off. Well with this new condom, you won't have to worry about slippage ever again! This miracle condom magnetically sticks to your ""mini-me"" through the iron in your blood! That's right. It turns out when all the blood rushes down there, there's enough iron in there for a magnet to stick, and leave slippage a thing of the past. Now that we've covered it won't slip off, notice its thickness? That's right, you'll never have to worry about a hole because of how thick it is. Now i know what you're thinking, how could anything else i say help you want this more? What if i told you this was reusable and machine washable. It's even microwavable for those cold winter nights, or when you need a c@m rag. I have a feeling these will be a big hit over in India."
4,Good childrens introduction to the stars.,"I bought this for my seven year old. He is delighted with it, the book is clearly a hit. The text is perfect for him to practice his reading as he learns about the stars.He is especially taken with stars he recognises, such as Betegeuse in Orion. And he was very impressed with the drawing of a planet being sucked into a black hole. That sparked a couple of days of discussion about what life would be like in black holes. Kids always love the gruesome stuff!The photographs of nebulae are very beautiful. I have to admit though, I'll need an adult version to answer some of the questions I am being asked."
3,Story of two fans.,This is a view into the lives of two people who are big fans of the pop star Tiffany.You discover the problems of these people and how they handle problems. Part of thatis to obsess about someone who brings them comfort through music.This film shows you a peek into the alternate thinking that drives these people.It is a thought provoking film. It won one award for best documentary.
4,Slide / Negative Scanner,"I am happy with my purchase of the Plustek 7200 scanner.The results are amazing! Very Happy!!What I did not like ...- Instructions. The quality of instructions (starting from installation of app) could have been far better. More detailed and systematic.- The ""Scratch & Dust Removal app"" crashes randomly. The Plustek help online was little help. I have to live with it. [Again could be a problem with the quality of information/solution - not up to the mark.]Now the good news...- Quality of scans was excellent! - Great resolution.- Scratch Removal & Dust Removal App - when it did the job (80% of the time) - it was AWESOME!!- Allows a fair bit of color/brightness/tone/contrast corrections - very handy.- Has a handy preview light-Box window on the top - nice!Good Value for money!"
4,Very pleased.,"This product worked as advertised. No problems installing the software on Windows Vista, which gives a variety of editing options after scanning. I am very pleased with this setup."
4,Very good film scanner,"I was hesitant to purchase this product but after reading the reviews I took the plunge, and today I'm glad I did. So far I have scanned over 200 slides and the images at 3600 DPI are truly stunning.The included Silverfast software is not great but it does the job where slides and black and white negatives are concerned. I do not like its output on color negatives but they can be post processed in Photoshop.All in all I think this is a great scanner at a great price point."
5,An exceptional scanner.,This scanner for slides and negatives was not only easy to use but was compact in size. It worked well with my Windows XP program and the pictures could be manipulated to change the amount of light and the color quality of the pictures. This is a superior product!
3,How does it work?,I find the instructions on how to set up the machine and how to make it work totally inadequate. It looks like it will do the job I want done but am having real trouble making it work.
2,"Zero documentation, no support, absolutely zero s/w support","Everyone is skeptical about a negative review, but this one's cool-headed, not borne from arrogance or frustration. I bought this based on performance, then price, and I've had success in getting good quality output. The problem is that there's no product documentation, and the software controller is a fragmented, five-part program from a separate provider that isn't integrated with the hardware. And it doesn't have user support or even an upgrade path.If this was still 2004, it would be acceptable to anyone with the abundant time to cobble all the pieces together to get it to work. But it's not, and this Team's product has been left behind. It's a dead limb on the evolutionary tree."
5,If scanning slides....this is it!,"I have about 1500 old family slides to scan. This unit works VERY well and its going much faster then I thought it would. I am scanning about 100 a day while I am working on other things. The resolution is more then enough for any need and the unit installed and worked perfectly right out of the box. For the price it cant be beat. It comes with two slide trays that hold 4 slides per tray. So while I am scanning one I am loading the other. Scanning times are longer for higher resolutions.One piece of advice, get some compressed air! The scanner is very good and will scan all the hair and other small debris on the slides. I make it a point to shoot compressed air at both sides of the slides and that removes 90% of the dirt that had built up over the last 30 years.If you are scanning slides with this unit (it also scans film negatives), you can always sell it for close to what Amazon is selling it after scanning your collection.As always Amazon was great."
4,Retired USNR O-6,"So far so good .... I received the Optic Film 7200 with the Silverfast SE disk version. B4 you start, you can get a FREE Silverfast Upgrade to 6.6.0r2 and there is another one due out shortly. Contact Laser Soft Imaging in Sarasota FL @ 941-921-4815 from 3PM to 5PM for tech support from ""Boris' -- he is very helpful. The Silverfast is terrific and once you get over the learning curve; you will be very satisfied. Forget the tutorial manual that Amazon links to the hardware; it does not address Silverfast SE technique -- only the higher versions e.g. Silverfast Ai. FYI -- Plustek is coming out with the NEW Plustek 7500i in 4Q2008. It will have the latest Silverfast software and better imaging at a respectful price."
4,Plustek 35mm scanner,"Easy set up with no glitches. Scans have good quality and reasonable speed. High quality scans are a bit slow, but for a scanner at this price lightning speed cannot be expected. My only significant criticism is the scanning software, that I find somewhat confusing to use and limited in color correction and editing at the pre-scan stage. Still, for the money it's a very good value."
1,Incredibly Bad Customer Service,"I purchased a Plustek OpticFilm 7200 from Amazon several months ago. It set up and worked fine for a week or so. Then the OpticFilm program indicated that the unit was not connected. It is properly connected and pressing buttons on the unit show reactions on the computer screen. But it will not work.So, after a thorough reading of the manual, which does not help in this situation, I determined to call for help. Here's what I found:""One of our representatives will be happy to assist you from Monday through Friday in office working hours as shown below:Other Countries or Areas (including United States)9:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. Taiwan Time""Unbelievable that Amazon sells these products without ensuring that there is appropriate U.S. customer service in place."
1,terrible directions,We have installed it but it will not work. It sounds like a great product but if you can't make it work it is useless.
4,Plustek 7200,Unit works great after downloading operating instructions from various forums on the internet. Unit only comes with installation instructions.
1,Could have rated better if it worked!,I bought this based on reading the reviews on Amazon. After wasting 2 days trying to install the software I sent it back. My computer would not read EITHER of the software CD's that came with this product. This product may work well but I never found out with the bad CD's and useless customer service for the software. I ended up buying a CanoScan 8800F and I LOVE it!
1,Ordered in January; still haven't received it in August.,"Can't say anything good about something you haven't received. I placed my order five (5) months ago and I'm still waiting for delivery.UPDATEMake that eight (8) months ago now and Amazon.com is still telling me that it's still on back-order. Anyone else receive one between 14 January 2010 - 4 August 2010?Amazon.com keeps asking if I want to cancel my order. I notice the price has more than doubled since I placed the order (was $165.94, now $349.99) and I wonder if that has anything to do with their failure to ship."
1,Everyone thinks this book is for beginners???,"The one star rating I gave this book was because I bought this book based on all the people who said this was a great book for beginners to learn SNMP. ABSOLUTELY NOT! If you are a beginner, don't touch this book. Nowhere in the book does it show you how to actually USE SNMP practically. It does throw out some code here and there, but doesn't explain how or why the code works...let alone the most important part...how to implement it. It's just code by itself sitting there. This book may be a good reference for the experienced, but all it is is definitions of the different parts of SNMP. Big waste of time and money for a beginner."
4,glow plugs,"I ordered 4 glow plugs for my chevy,I recieved 3, I was charged for three. A few days laterI recieved the other one and was then charged. I would like to have known that thelast plug was still coming. Other than that everything worked out well."
5,Blues to the bone....,"Excellent disc all around - great sound quality, great selection of songs, dynamite guitar work and ""signature sound"" singing. When you listen to Wolf sing the Blues, you are getting the Real Deal as far as I'm concerned. When I listen to today's Blues artists, they're nice and everything but most of them have never seen a hard day in their life compared to people like Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Howlin' Wolf. The Blues for them came from having survived hard times and bringing the feeling of being a survivor to life in their music.If you want to see where the real Blues comes from, give this one a spin and you won't be disappointed."
1,How Arron Really Beat Shaq,"I Think this DVD is terrible, that party wasn't really at his house and Every kid is gonna wanna beat Shaq, these are false advertisements and will confuse kids and my 84 year old uncle, the poor guy said why does he want candy so bad, now my 81 year old aunt is calling Shaq for her new video "" I'm 80 and i beat Shaq"", this is redicioulus, i just want to tell the buyers beware."
1,This Dude Sucks,"This guy is a wannabe. He couldn't even dance if his life depended on it. My sisters friend loves him. She has way bad taste. Anyone who buys it isn't getting their money's worth. Heck, buyin that is like burning a twenty dollar bill.DON'T BUY IT!!!"
5,I like it,5/5 awesome 4/5 good 3/5 okay 2/5 bad 1/5 awful 1. 5/5 Aaron's Party- Aaron's parents leave and Aaron throws a party. 2. 5/5 I Want Candy-Aaron is on a date and his friends keep following him around. 3. 3/5 Bounce-It's pretty much Aaron walking on the street with his friends. 4.2/5 Iko Iko- My least favorite video. All it is is Aaron on a beach waving streamers around. 5.4/5 Clapping Song- I'm not sure what it's about but I do like the dance routine.
3,Worth a try!,"Wow - just wow. The graphics in this game are better than some of the top titles out right now, and for half the price, that ain't bad.To the person having trouble running - the hunter you choose has stats. If you pick a hunter with low strength he can only carry a certain amount of weight, you probably have too many heavy items in your backpack. I think this is pretty realistic, and I really like that the stats actually effect the game."
2,read britannica instead,"_The Joy of Trivia_ consists of a preface, then an entire book worth of paragraph-long bits of random trivia. There is no index, so the best way to read is just to open the book at random, possibly on the john or in a similar location.I found many trivia that were wrong, and several of dubious veracity. IF you want to amuse yourself with random facts, I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,The Master returns!,"Keeper of Traken is a very simplistic story, but it does set things up for the return of the Master and the conflict that will ensue between him and the Doctor."
4,Suitable for occasional use,This is a good product for a decent price. Tethers are too short to be much use but cuffs are well built and comfy. At least as comfy as restraints can be.
1,Horrible,The quality of this product in no way compares to its price... it fell apart the first time we used it.
4,Not a Toy actually...,"Not sure why this is listed under toys as it's a tool, and a sharp and dangerous tool for kids.The tool itself works very well, assuming you're using it for its main purpose of cutting plastic pieces of a model away from the sprue (tree). It does leave a bit of plastic on the piece you are cutting away though, so I can't give it 5 stars. You'll still have to scrape with a hobby knife or sand or file it.It's now way overpriced since I bought mine, retailing at around $20 from a $27 msrp. I bought mine for about $8 when it came out.I would suggest not getting this tool and instead buying the Xuron Ultraflush Cutting Shear 4'', model #410A (not model #410). It actually cuts much closer than this tool, but can only be used on plastic models (not for cutting metal wire) or else you'll damage the blade. It retails for only $8.69 and is of high build quality.Check out http://www.hobbylinc.com/htm/xur/xur410a.htm until someone at Amazon decides to carry it."
5,Daughter's favorite 20 years ago!,"I got this for my daughter on her 21st birthday because it was her favorite before she could read or talk. She loved the baby illustrations. We went through this book so many times she used to say ""no, no, no"" in anticipation before we turned the page where the baby spills the contents of Momma's purse. Glad to see this is still around. Share this with your 1, 2, 3 or 4 year old. Wonderful."
2,this one went back,"Philip, have a tie-in with Sector watches; Sector Group SpaVia Manzoni 37 - Milano. I have loved Sector watches since I worked in Milan after university, have a few and adored the style. There were a bunch of Philip watches on sale here on Amazon at the end of 2007, I missed them and regret it.I bought this one at the end of 2008 for $79 and free shipping. The watch comes in a beautiful Wooden box (probably the best presentation of any watch I have ever purchased). The watch is good quality, all stainless steel and the band has a nice heft to it. I could easily see this on the wrist of a business associate in Milan.While the girlfriend loved this, I didn't see the point. It's not a conservative design, but then it's not making a statement either.Let's face it. It's quartz. It's an Italian with a Swiss inner constitution but it is still quartz and like a woman with good form and a bland personality I know I'd soon lose interestSorry Philip. Back you go."
4,Very well played but very polished.,"This is for sure an excellent recording, but very polished. There aremore preferable versions from the BPO, Jochum (best of all) and wonderfulKarajan's for EMI."

3,Interesting but not blown away by it,What I did find interesting is that the handles have a orange reflector light in them like a bike's. This one is pink. Bought for a relative.
3,If It Wasn't Sutcliff...,"I love Sutcliff, and I get all of her I can. This one definitely wasn't the best I've ever read. It was mostly a long, long tale with the real plot thrown in in pieces. It was a feud, and it ended a bit sour for our hero, so that part wasn't even encouraging. Her fine characters and delicate descriptions are as good as ever...but the plot could have used a little more work."
2,Not very interesting,"This book is a mixture of Halloween poems and stories. I only read about 1/3 of it because I just didn't find the stories to be that interesting. This book is intended for ""young readers"" so that might explain my feelings about the book. And unfortunately I don't have any children to read the stories to in order to get a child's perspective..."
2,False Advertising,"I bought this for my son to use for school reports. I had no idea it would have such an anti-Catholic bias. I thought it would encompass a more universal Christian theme. Rather, its story-telling promotes an agenda highly critical of Catholicism. It lacks objectivity. I plan to give this book away to a Protestant friend."
1,Could lead to the burning of Catholics,"I bought this book thinking it would have a universal view on the reformaion, but it has a highly anti-catholic view. Reading what Hannula states that what the Catholics believe is not in the scriptures I decided to do my own research and found that in fact all of what they believe about mass IS in scriptues.Luke 22.19.I would not even think about giving this book to a child who would be forming such a biased untruth thinking."
5,Great service and good book too!,"Great service-received book, in good condition, in just a few short days!The book is exactly what we wanted and getting it at a reduced rate and shippedstraight to the door was a bonus! Thank you!"
5,awesome,"""Awesome"" in the old sense of the word. Awe-inspiring stories of early church history and heroism. Beautifully written with a style accessible for all ages. It tackles difficult material in an appropriate and understandable way."
3,247 pages on John's Prologue,"Alison Jasper's book analyzes interpretations of John's Prologue by the following: St. Augustine, Martin Luther, Hildergard von Bingen, Adrienne von Speyr, and Rudolf Bultmann. Each interpretation is shown to be clothed in patriarchy.Jasper then analyzes the prologue from a feminist viewpoint using deconstructionist and structuralist methodology (strictly speaking, can deconstruction be called a method?).Her own three readings of the text reflect the feminine in John's prologue - the shining garmet of the text.I would only recommend this book if you are interested in the history of interpretation of the Fourth Gospel. Futhermore, beware, you probably should at least have a passing knowledge of intertexuality, Paul Ricoeur, and Julia Kristeva.This book is definately for the specialist in Johannine feminist studies."

2,Disappointing,"I thought this book was very boring and lacking in action. I know the author claims he was a party member and in the Wermacht, but I cannot get into his books, even Night of the Generals. Not enough action or anything else of substance to keep my interest."
5,sobering,"This somber, reflective photo book is of actual artifacts left at the wall. Very good. When I was in DC in 1998 there was an exhibit at the American History Smithsonian Museum that put objects left at the wall on view to the public. It was my hands down favorite of all the Smithsonian exhibits. I was there for hours. This is the next best thing to being there."
5,"Very touching, makes you think.",I bought this book awile ago. Some of the things left behind have letters or notes attached to them. Very chilling. Awesome book for anyone. I love it.
3,"OK, but hopefully there are better Schnauzer books out there.","I am a first time mini schnauzer owner not interested in breeding or showing, just wanted to get some general information on the breed and training as the product description implies. This book was OK, but I felt there was a lot of inapplicable information in the book and not enough for the ""new owner"" about grooming, training, and what to expect from the puppy. It was more about what to expect when SHOWING your dog. For someone who is not interested in showing or breeding, DO NOT buy this book. I am still looking for a better one."
4,"Good, Quick read","I read this book cover to cover in a couple days. I thought it was a great introduction to the mini schnauzer breed, including history, behavior and care. While it is not an exhaustive guide, it provides important information and can be a great starting point. Technical guides can sometimes be overwhelming, and I think this book is a good, quick read to provide yourself sound background information. It's also a handy reference to keep around."
1,Don't get it!,This really isn't worth the money. The acting is piss-poor and the plot is unbelievably stupid. It's basically a series of excuses to have sex.
3,Didn't know 2 episodes made a season,I enjoyed the season but only 2 episodes per season is not quite what I had iin mind.
3,very good cinema,"This product is erotic, intimate, and enticing. If you are into mystery, drama, sex, and the unknown..this is something for you to watch."
3,not what i expected,i bought this right after i finished watching all the seasons from queer as folk. the storyline of dante's cove is not so good and the acting is very poor (especially on season 1). i was very disappointed.
1,"about this boxed season 1 + 2 edition, not about the series","I am here reviewing this edition only.For my reviews on the first and second season, please see the individual season.I bought the boxed set because it was cheaper than getting the two seasons separately, but if you already got them, please save your money and do avoid buying this.As far as this edition is concerned, it is lousy.It boxes season one and two, all right.The third dvd is the so called ""lost pilot"" and offers a very crudely filmed attempt at the first episodes of season one. Technical quality is extremely bad, script, direction and acting are even a little worse than that...In my reviews I complained about the quality of the two actual seasons, calling them a lightweight; well, compared to this ""thing"" they could be considered outstanding achievements.Extras are negligible here as are those in the other two dvds, perhaps even shorter and worse."
1,Two thumps way down,"The only thing worst than the non-existing story line is the acting, but atleast they are good looking. Ok well I made my point."
2,slow slow slow,"this was the slowest shipping process that i have ever dealth with my entire internet shopping experience. never will I ever order though this seller again, yet product was received."
4,Dantes Cove,Loved the dvd set it came alot sooner than I expected I just wish they had a short plotof what the dvd was about.
1,Terrible show.,"What incredible schlock! It is as if it had been written by horny 13 year olds who've only ever seen trashy shows on TV. The acting is horrendous throughout, the guys look like queer underwear catalog rejects, totally predictable and shallow. The music is of no interest whatsoever, and frankly I struggle to find any redeeming quality to this crap. As if this mess wasn't painful enough to suffer through, some halfwit decided it would add to the ""drama"" to have thunder and lightning at any given time or place, be it a sunny day or a garden party, not a tree moving in the wind and the cars with their top down but somehow as soon as some is indoor there goes the stormy effect. This gives one a good idea of how cheap and predictable this piece of junk is. Save your time, if you want to see truly hot guys and girls going at it, there are plenty of choices out there, just not THAT!"
1,Gay Porn,"It could have been good, if it wasn't more Gay porn than anything. Mostof it is just gay sex."
1,Dantes Cove,Very disapointing never got it and then with out a notice I got a note that the seller cancelled the orderPoor customer service
1,GHASTLY!,"My gawd, WHAT an embarrassment. (Why is so much of ""Gay entertainment"" so gawd awful bad?!?) Softcore titillation -- without the benefit of being good drama. Perfect for pure-eyecandy, but not much else.Casting: Based on ""looks"" (and not on actual acting ability). Script: Whatever links two suggestive music-video sex-scenes together. Characters: It's hard to actually care about these people. And what sick queen did the make-up for this series? (The ""1840s"" women look like 1970s whores.)Vapid. Clichéd. Trash-TV.Horrible. Buy it for a door-stop.If you want a good combination of sexuality and ""the occult"" in a TV ""series"", you're better off going with ""TRUE BLOOD"". At least that series is good & engaging storytelling."
5,Awesome,"This show is incredible. Hot gay guys, sex, fidelity and drama. What a perfect combination!I guarantee that you will like this show. Be sure to watch ALL the seasons."
5,"Dantes Cove, MY new guilty pleasure","I am so glad I bought this series!The acting in the first season was very sketchy at times, but who needs good acting when you have sexy guys shirtless in every scene, not to mention amazing love stories and HOTT encounters!The second season acting gets better as the episodes progress,all in all I LOOVE this series !"
3,Run of the Mill Thriller,"With The Girls He Adored, Jonathan Nasaw has created a thoroughly evil serial killer in the style of Hannibal Lecter. Fortunately, Nasaw is a more proficient writer than Thomas Harris. On the other hand, while Nasaw does a great job characterizing Maxwell, the killer, he does a poor job with other characters. He's able to present a complex character in Maxwell, complete with countless multiple personalities, but spends little time on other characters. The other flaw is that the action is completely predictable. While some of the characters' motivations are revealed over time and are somewhat surprising, the overall action doesn't deviate from standard thriller/suspense fare. The Girls He Adored is neither great nor horrible. It's an entertaining, quick read. If that's all you're looking for, you'll be pleased with it. If you're after anything deeper or more creative, look elsewhere."
3,Too predictable,While it was a good read- it was too predictable. I need a mystery and I knew the whole time while reading it how the ending would be.
1,Too transparent & predictable,The Girls He AdoredA rather thin and predictable story. So many holes in the narative about a multi personality murderer that in the end the device only served to show the authors flaws in plotline and suspense. Don't waste your time
2,Long and drawn out.,"This was such a slow read. There was way too much information in this book that could have been left out. True, there were times when there was some ""nail biting"" but it was rare. Comparing this book to Silence of the Lambs is a complete injustice to Thomas Harris. This was a bland thriller about a man with multiple personalities, most of them unpleasant. When he was a little boy, Max had abusive parents. They did awful things to him, as a result of this he became a sociopath. Among his many multiple personalities is Kinch. He's the alter who does the knife work. He's also the one responsible for the all the raping. The FBI has been tracking his profile for over ten years and they think they have finally found their man, but it's almost too late."
2,too violent,"There are serial killer books that are interesting because of the forensics involved in the hunt. This one, however, seems too focused on just the prurient titillation of the violent actor. I did not like it."
2,Somewhat dry.,"Interesting in a dry and scholarly way. The author assumes you already know the history of England so he doesn't give much explanation about who's on the throne, or about events taking place. He only explains how they affected life in London. Which is all right; just be prepared. I read this book in conjunction with Rutherfurd's London, and the two together gave me a good picture of the city."
5,Three highly spiritual talents combine,"Cherie Larkin wrote the script for this deeply devotional and spiritual tape; Michael Moran who was the reader on one of the Daily Word tapes is also the reader here; and Coco Ramos, who performs on the Inner Time, Inner tempo tape provides the musical background. The result is a tape which can be used to aid meditation, whether you use it in the morning at sunrise, or evening at sunset, or bedtime or whenever. Many of the thoughts are scriptural, and they are all spiritually uplifting, suitable for the beginning, the middle, or the end of day."
3,Average episode,"This episode is not one of the greats. It suffers from annoying dialogue between a variety of gangs (red and blue Kangs). However, other than the special effect of the Great Architect, it has some of the best special effects of the series. The underpopulated street sets are some of the best you will ever see. Not Sylvester McCoys best episode. But it is still a good viewing. END"
3,"Fun episode , annoying Kangs!","The Doctor and Mel head to Pardaise Towers for a time off from their travels!When they arrive, the travellers disover Paradise Towers is a big mess! The Doctor and Mel meet the Kangs who live in the Towers. The traveler get seperated,but later meet at the end. Mel meets Pex, a young man with a secret past. The Doctor meanehile is mistaken for the tower creator by it's caretaker. The real villian is shown at the end but I will not ruin for those who have yet to see it! The story itself could use a little work, but at least it's a fun episode! The only thing annoying about this episode is tha Kangs and their yelling the whole time!"
1,Another nail in Doctor Who's coffin ...,"This episode also defines all the abominable horrors in Doctor Who's final years which sealed its fate and got it cancelled. Silly premises, camp execution, inability to suspend disbelief, bland dialogue and virtually lucidiously homosexual secondary characters with child molesting undertones makes this story (and most all late 80s Doctor Who episodes) unwatchable for the over 10 year old crowd. I was still trying to watch the series at this point, but even I couldn't take the schlock in THIS demented episode. Obviously I am not alone in feeling put out since all of Britain quit watching by this time in the series enormous history. Yeah, its the same review I gave for 'Happiness Patrol', but it works equally as well."
3,Silly but it's Fun,"The highlight of this Dr. Who story for me was the wonderfully comic perfomance of Richard Briers as the Chief Caretaker. He is perhaps best known to us as being a member of Monty Python, but I will always think of him as Tom Good from the Brit-Com ""Good Neighbors"" (a.k.a. The Good Life).(The title of my review is from an episode of that show BTW.) In fact the acting overall in this one is very good. Another brit-com celebrity, Judy Cornwall who played Daisy in ""Keeping Up Apperances"" , also makes an apperance. The story, while entertaining, is a bit silly however. People being chased around by big lumbering mechanical cleaners is just a little far-fetched. I'd give it an extra half or maybe even 3 quarters, but we can't do that. I also did an earlier review of ""Dragonfire"" which I gave 4 stars and said it was the best of Season 24 and I must be consistant, mustn't I?"
4,good leash for large dog,works well for our Newfoundland. beats having to wrap leash around hand when approaching others on walking path. wo uhh ld buy again
4,Good buy,"This is a nice, solid, strong leash, but it's a tad bit heavy. I think it's made for a BIG dog, like a Newfoundland or St. Bernard."
4,Range pans and rings,Item was exactly as described and fit the models listed. Was exactly was I was looking for and couldn't find in any local stores. The appliance stores want at least twice as much to special order the replacement drip pans and rings
2,confusing description,"Despite the title being ""GE hinged drip pan"", I noticed the product description says ""WILL NOT fit GE or Hotpoint Ranges"". I'm completely baffled.Also - I need the 3 small, 1 large set - and a reviewer here say this came as 2 and 2. Is this the 3-1 or not? I'm mostly reviewing a description at this point, since it's so confusing I can't order the product!"
4,"Not exactly a ""chrome"" finish","More like a brushed aluminum satin finish, but still very nice for a hard to find item. Would definately buy again."
2,Um....Trash?,wow..what can i say about this book...? lifeless character. and JD??? he had nothing to do w/ the story. You couldn't relate to the saddness of her parent's break up at all....horrible book. the only good thing about it was that it wasn't boring.
3,Maybe tried a little too hard...,"When I first started reading Love and Other Four Letter Words, I almost threw it away after only a few pages. The author seems like she is just trying so hard to relate to teenagers and their thoughts but really, I couldn't relate to anything that she was saying. She was really dirty mouthed and very gross sexually throught out the entire book practically. It wasn't even funny.Was this review helpful to you?Was this review helpful to you?"
2,sucky!!!! ugh,"goodness, what do I have to say to this poorly written novel. hmmm.....Sucky!!! Wow this book seemed like it could have been written by a second grader. It was so not what I thought it would be. Don't buy it I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DON'T!!"
1,Not another one,Must disagree. I expected much more from this book and it turned out to just be another teen-age girl rant. If you're looking for a good book for your daughter stick to the classics like Judy Bloom.
3,great for pre-teens,"This book is good if you're a pre-teen, or older and not really into heavy reading. It's easy to read and follow. I'd say the story itself is happier than the books I usually read, so it was a bit disappointing. Not that I'm a freak or anything, I just think books are better when the main character has major problems. Maybe that's just me, though."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"I usually read magazines but when I was in the teen section of the library I found Love and Other Four-letter Words. It's a wonderful book because how Samantha thinks, talks, and reacts to those situations in the book is typically how most people would. Because of this book I'm going to read more often and I can't wait until more of Carolyn Mackler's books come out. Thank you for writing this one!P.S. I suggest all you girls get Love and Other Four-letter Words right away and make sure you have a lot of time 'cause you won't want to put it down."
5,Love and Other Four Letter Words-a great book!,"I bought this book maybe 2 months ago and I've read it maybe 20 times! This book is never boring. I loved it! Sammie is a character I completely understand with her love of music, overbearing best friend, loveable dog-loving new friend, and innocent crushes. Sammie Davis is moved out of small town America to NYC with her mother, who she doesn't understand, due to her parents' trial separation. Sammie learns to deal with life in the big city, meeting new people, running the household, new crushes, and learning to back away from an abusive friend. Sammie faces adult problems (such as having food in the house and taking care of her mother who continues to have a sort of nervous breakdown) and teen problems (such as dealing with a friend who takes too much and getting a crush to notice her). She is a strong willed, believeable character. A must read!"
4,Love and other four letter reviews.,"Its really a great book. Its not like a normal narration of the sidekick to the most popular girl in school because she's not as cynical as voices in princess diaries, etc. I enjoyed this book a lot while reading it and related to it on several levels. I loved this book."
5,Love and Other Four Letter Words,This is a great book for almost anyone looking for something to relate to. I am extremely critical of what i read and this book is my absolute favorite! I strongly suggest you get it and read it a hundred and fifty times
3,Ok,"I did not like this book very much. It threw around culture references that no one i know would ever say. Please, no one says something to this extent I thought our family was 7th Heaven. There were a few good moments like when she hooked up with that Eli person. But Johnny Depp? He is so ugly."
5,Great Book.. A Must Read!,"Sammie Davis is not your typical teenager- she plays folk music on her dad's old guitar, she feels inferior to her friend Kitty (despite the ""Grand Tetons"") and her life is about to drastically change.When her father tells Sammie that he and her mother are having a trial separation this summer, she feels cheated somehow. To add insult to injury, her mother rents out their house to ""the Oscar Meyer Weiners"" and takes Sammie to New York City for the summer.What follows are months of misery and disappointment. Her mother falls into an abyss of self-pity when she can't find work in New York, Sammie realizes that maybe Kitty isn't such a great friend after all, plus finds someone who IS a great friend. In between, there's nervous flirting with the Johnny Depp look-a-like from upstairs, baby-sitting and one huge emotional blow-up.It's predictable and pointless, but you can't deny that it's entertaining."
3,Moderately okay...,"It's pretty short, and the writing is quite light, but the story is alright. Mackler manages to breath originality into the story of a teenager having to deal with their parent's separation, and the result is a fairly good book. The main reason that I gave this book 3 stars is that, though I enjoyed it while I was reading it, it's just not four- or five-star material. Though I can relate to some of the things that Sammie had to deal with, she didn't really come alive for me while I was reading this book. This book is for teenage girls who are not looking for a very omplicated book."
5,One of the best books I've read in a long time!,"I think almost anyone who has moved away from everything that is familiar can relate to this story. It was wonderful, witty, different, and a definite page turner! Worth buying!"
1,Not that interesting,I thought this book was gonna be amazing but it sure wasn't. I wasn't expecting it to be the best thing I've ever read but I was at least expecting it to be funny. And it sure wasn't. It was boring and slow and I couldn't even bring myself to read it to the very end. Maybe my expectations were too high but this sure didn't meet them. It didn't even come close.
1,I wudn't use this book to wipe my ass with....,"i didnt read this book past the first chapter until i decided to throw it away in the trash where it belonged! this abomination was written by a second-grader! no type of style, or realistic characters, no detailed discriptions. nothing, nada. ""jack wants me to give him a blow job"" said Kitty, is just about as interesting as it gets, and thats not saying much...the writting is so superficial and shallow..i bet ""blondiebuttercup"" wrote it.(air-head, bubble-gum-cracking bimbo material). warning: this novel may cause severe headaches and damage to the brain. stay. away. from. this. book!"
3,"Good, but not powerful","I was really looking forward to reading this book because I LOVEThe Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things, but I found this book merely a good read. I was etertained without beeing moved by the situations Sammi faced, and I feel her charater was more shallow and undeveloped compaired to the situations she was facing. I did find Eli a very interesting fellow, and I was moved at times by the relationship between Sammi and her mother. I just wish there was more development of that teenaged angest."
3,Disappointing,"This book was very disappointing. It was way too on the ""surface"" and there was no character development. It didn't provoke any emotions and it was basically just a chick flick."
5,Love and Other Four-Letter Words,Carolyn really grasps what its like to be a teeanger. Her bluntness is amazing. This book it riveting and helped me deal with problems of my own. Beauty is Truth...
4,Almost,"I enjoyed this book (see other reviews forbetter description of the content), but there area few things that bothered me about it. First ofall, there are some unnecessary words and sexualreferences that make me uncomfortable puttingthis book in my collection at a rather conservativeschool. Secondly, I found the ending a bit onthe too good side. She gets a boyfriend and getskissed. She fights with her friend, but stillholds out the possibility of making up. Herparents trial separation may not be permanent.Everything has some possibly rosy future. A bittoo sweet for me."
5,It's Fantastic,"This book is so great. It is one of the best that I've read. This may be like Judy Blume but it is way more modernized. Carolyn Mackler is such a beautiful writer and I hope everyone likes it as much as I did. I am on the edge of my seat waiting for Carolyn's next book. Love and other four letter words is a masterpiece and Carolyn is a magnificent writer. No one can compare to this book or Carlyn. I am honered to have such a good young adult writer in this country. This book is real, it makes you want to go to the bookstore."
5,A book for all ages,"I bought this book for my 2 teenage daughters; they both loved it so much, I had to read it as well. I found it funny, enlightening, and very much in tune with the issues I have experienced with my daughters, who have been through their parents divorce. Sammy is a genuine teen; Carolyn Mackler has written of her trials and tribulations in such an entertaining manner, the 3 of us (my daughts and I) await the sequel or, at least, Carolyn Mackler's next novel. A must read!"
4,Intelligent and comprehensive...,"A little obscure at times, but intelligent and comprehensive. An excellent exposition comparing Hinduism to Christianity and other Western religions, and discussing how Hinduism may be a more powerful spiritual path even for the Westerner steeped in Judeo-Christian mythology. Also goes in-depth into the specifics of Hindu philosophy and practice."
3,Tom Baker AND special effects,"That's what makes this season so cool. Tom Baker who always steals the show(unlike his sucessors) and good flashy special effects to boot. There is only one setting throughout the whole show and it is the hive which can get boring(like a lot of so-called sci-fi shows nowadays which are single setting soap opras). But thier was that bit about the Doctor growing old which I thought was very well done. He appeared 103 but acted like a wize old 1250 year-old traveler of the universe. This wasn't Tom's best show(excellent acting though on his part) but it wasn't bad either and I had a feeling when I first watched it that things were only going to get better. I still think this season got progressively better, especilally the E-space Trilogy(another story)."
3,Something of a guilty pleasure,"The plot is cliched where it makes sense at all, the Fomasi costumes are appalling, and some of the director's choices are puzzling (what's with that hideously long tracking shot of the beach? or Romana pulling the Doctor's scarf for what seems like 30 seconds?). But... there's something about the generally quick pace, the insistent music, the brightness of the sets, and maybe the general campiness that pulls it through. And who can miss David Haig chewing the scenery as Pangol? On the (genuinely) up side, the Argolin make-up is wonderful."
2,"Show was slow,uninteresting, and humorless","Show developed slowly,Nothing really happened and the ending had little to do with rest of story.there was none of the humora Tom Baker story usually has."
3,Loud drumming noise.,"First off, the drums on this album sound incredible. Props to whoever did the audio enginerring job. This was my first listen to William Hooker so I'm not that familiar with his music (thanks though, Emusic.com). However, this is strictly avant-garde, there are few if any discernable melodies or song structures here. Just alot of heavy drum pounding mixed with saxaphone squealing and the odd electronic sounds."
5,look what the universe can do,"This stellar musician moves deftly between different genres and bestows upon each song alternately delicate and rocking touches.The woman has mastered the tools of voice and bass and keeps pushing them to further degrees.MS. Dorsey is one of those rare musicians who brings such depth and new life through vocals and bass guitar. Someone of this exceptional caliber gives justice to the notion of being ""touched by God."" Genius permeates her work at almost every step.This accomplished disc is diverse and multifaceted with infinite textures to be enjoyed over and over again. The songs are rich and enduring.Those of us who have followed her through the years (for me it was TFF through all the Bowie years) have been won over for some time. It's nice to see her shine all on her own."
2,Highly academic,"This book is a sheer disspointment, as the talisman are just copied from the Dao-tsang. It does not reveal how the talisman is drawn, the rituals involved etc... It's just a collection of talisman bound together with narrations and nothing more.I would suggest you guys to read instead ""The Secret of Taoist Talisman Revealed"" ISBN 983-3206-00-X By Wilson Yong."
5,"Fantastic, Mysterious, Mystical","I was surprised by the low ratings by others -- this is a book I have enjoyed for years. I am blown away by the graphic impact and the raw energy of this imagery. I do not want to become a Taoist priest, so I find the info that Legeza shares sufficient. I believe the intent of this book is to share a scholarly description and an aesthetic appreciation of an arcane art. I am not sure these would make very good tattoos, but I do continue to find this book wondrous!"
2,Poor quality overall. Not pleased with this specific product,"I purchased this book for ""high quality artwork"" and depictions and translations of chinese charachters. The artistry is poor to say the least, and the amount of information leaves a bit to be desired. I did not find this book to be a source of artwork worthy of being applied to the skin as a tattoo either. Overall I found the book overglorified."
5,excellent resource for tattoo designs.,excellent resource for tattoo designs.Very imformative on the Chinese Art of the Occult.
2,Thank goodness it wasn't a series,"The only good thing I have to say about this video is that as the only Dr. Who spin-off, it does have some nostalga value. Other than that I found it trite and not very well executed. K-9 is supposed to the the star (at least that's what the title leads us too belive) and apart from his usual vulcan-esquse logical statements all he does is blast a few people. I love Dr. Who and I like K-9, but that's all there is to like about this video."
4,Did not use on a bed.,I got these to lift up something on my patio and they work great. They are big and ugly so would not want them in the bedroom or living room. They are ok for what I needed them for.
4,works well,"I used these lifts to raise my vanity so that I can actually sit up to the vanity (with my legs underneath, not at). The vanity if very stable, I have no issues when opening and closing drawers. Great product."
1,Bed collapsed right through,My pretty standard queen sized bed broke right through the plastic risers when after two weeks when my pretty standard male body laid on it. Bed risers work but these don't.-Dave
1,Don't Waste your money!!!!,"I just put the bed on these risers.....and I just took it apart and put them back in the box. As soon as the bed was put back together, I sat on the bed to see how sturdy it would be. The bed fell off the risers and collapsed. They really STINK!!! I will be sending them back."
4,Top Thriller,"Great story - keeps you interested. James Mason gives his usual excellent performance, the typical cool British agent. Recommend it for Mason fans."
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this to see James Mason, but Carla Lehmann gets most of the screen time. Mason is very young, and does not have a very interesting character.As far as the movie itself, the plot is silly and the action is contrived. I guess you can forgive them for some flag waving in 1944, but the movie is still bad.Skip this movie and track down a copy of ""Hotel Reserve"" (1946), only 2 years later but Mason is now the star and has an interesting persona. Now that's a good movie."
2,Not too good,"This book does give some useful techniques for preparing for the GMAT but be aware that the questions on the actual GMAT test are a lot harder than the ones in the book or the ones on their test online. I thought the verbal part was pretty similar to the questions in the book, but the quantitative part was quite different. I recommend getting an additional book on the math part of the GMAT."
4,Good start without the band,This small group of songs was a great addition to anyone's Goo Goo Doll collection. Rzeznik does a spectacular job in singing these songs as he has done with the songs he has sung with the band 'Goo Goo Dolls'.I would recomend this cd to anyone who enjoy's the GGD's music or the music of Matchbox 20.
1,The Worst Ever!!!!!,"This is by far the worst cd I own. I have every dire straits/knopfler cd there are. It is by one band called the Sultans of Swain (the same band the song was written about 25 years ago). It is no mystery why we have never heard of them since. The singer is a cross between Lou Reed, Bob Dylan, and Porky Pig. No emotion in any of the singing or guitar parts. The guitarist seems to be reading the music with no feeling at all. He may not have ever heard the original songs. I would have thought I was on Candid Camera if I was not in my house the first time I listened to it. It is pathetic. The only reason they got signed, is because Mark wrote such a great song about the band 25 years ago. Don't waist your time......."
1,OMG,"Just listen to the previews here or in iTunes, what were they thinking? Get a Mark Knopfler/DS album instead and do yourself a favor."
3,"""As long as you bear my mark, I own you!""","The Doctor and Mel land on Iceworld, where they inadvertently meet up with Glitz, looking for a treasure guarded by a fire breathing dragon! Apart from some ridiculous dialogue, a silly looking monster, and an uneven awkward script, ""Dragonfire"" can be very enjoyable to the undiscriminating Who fan. Tony Selby's return as Glitz is great. He and the Doctor make a great double-play. It's also a great story for Ace, even if she does have some of goofiest lines in the story. And Kane is a wonderful vilian, not totally OTT. It's a shame he commits suicide. Great soundtrac and design, some fun humor, and Mel gets a nice emotional send off. An enjoyable McCoy runaround."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"The only bright spot in this adventure is that after this, there's nowhere to go but up---and Mel leaves too, thank goodness. Dragonfire is an unorganized mess from start to finish and it's just a poorly conceived story with one of the most ridiculous cliffhangers ever in the history of the series, ironically hanging off a cliff needlessly. It does not get any worse than this and I'm even including the horrific Trial of a time lord in there as well. Again, thankfully, things do a 180 when the new season would start the following year with Remembrance of the Daleks."
4,read past the magic part,This is a great resource for those wanting to learn further about how to relate to an audience. You could easily substitute the work presentation for magic in the book.
5,Gift,My son is a magician and wanted this book. It came before Christmas and looked new. He was so happy and so was I.
2,To much magic not enough showmanship.,The author gives (in my opininion) to many effects in this book. He tries to get his point across by teaching trick instead of actually going into the psychological factors behind the point he is making.
3,Yet another magic book,"I feel the same way about all my magic books.Not particularly easy to read. All magic books are usually pretty obscure, for a reason: Magic doesn't really exist, and tricks are nothing more than obsuring the audiences perception. A good magician never learns from a book, they learn from another good magician. I don't know why I thought this would be different. It'll teach you concepts, but to truly pull these things off requires lots of practice."
3,Expected more,"I honestly expected more from this book. It's not a bad book, but i found it a little bit boring."
1,Not as described - different hook,"The product differs from that shown. The leash itself it constructed well with double handle as described. The hook itself is not as shown in the picture. The photo of the product shows a ""C"" style hook, and the product itself is a standard ""a"" style hook. I find that the standard hook tends to break down faster in the spring. I purchased this item mainly because of its double handle design with ""C"" style hook. I would love to send it back, but I already tore the tags off before I took note of the difference."
3,SUPRISINGLY FUNNY,"Most of the vignettes were amusing. My personal favorite was ""The Sugar Daddy"". We all know people like the characters and types that are portrayed in the film and that makes the film more appealing. I recommend it."
3,Sums men up...,"This movie categorizes different types of men,most of which was pretty accurate.However, there is an excessive amount of sex scenes that I didn't expect,a nd did not like, There was poor picture and sound quality as well."
5,Excellent Movie for ANY woman,This was a great movie. I love it. I've probably watched it 5 times already. It arrived in excellent condition. The cover was still the original and intact.
1,Black Man's Guide To Finding A Bad Movie,"This movie was horrible, and the title is misleading. This movie isn't a guide for anything, it's just a series of relationships that end up bad, with no resolution to them. If the director was going to call it a ""Guide"" to finding a good man, he should have offered up some guidance, not just showing the traps that women black women fall in, and leave it at that.I saw potential in this movie, because the scenario's were thought provoking, and there were classic situations that black women find themselves in when it comes to relationships, but the director left me wanting more, and didn't deliver."
2,WASTE,I DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE IT HARDLY KEPT MY ATTENTION I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.
2,Leaks faster,"I have to say this pump barely works.I did read the reviews, and when I saw people saying it leaking, I didn't expect it to be this bad. Maybe I got the super leaking one, but it's definitely unacceptable. I used it only once, and when I tried to put air into the ball, it leaked faster than inflating. So I ended up with a more loose ball and more tired than playing a game!In one word, I hate it... even with this price"
2,Just barely functional,"This pump is just *barely* effective at inflating my basketball. When you put the needle in the ball, air starts leaking from the top of the pump immediately. I have to pump as fast as I can to outpace the constant leak.The pump is cheap, and it's technically working, but it sucks. Buy something else."
1,Leaks and won't actually pump up balls,"I bought this pump to replace pocket pump that had given up the ghost.This pump is so leaky that it won't pump up a standard basketball, or a youth size soft football. You can pump all you want, but the air just leaks out around the internal valve. And if you don't yank it out of the ball right away, it let's the air that is in the ball out.This is really disappointing. It is the first product I've bought on Amazon (and I'm a Prime member, so I order quite a bit), that I haven't been impressed with. IMHO, Amazon should pull this product from its shelves."
2,Poor design - use carefully,"Like most inexpensive plastic pumps, this pump has a bit of a leakage, which is not a big deal but unlike some other models, this pump does not have a soft tube connecting the pump and the needle - the needle is inserted directly into the pump. My first time using it, I had to press the pump into the ball to minimize the air leakage, and with one careless slip I broke the needle and left it inside the ball, and the ball now bounces with an extra jingle and is pretty much unplayable.Careful: this pump is not fool proof!"
1,Just don't buy it,"We bought this pump (Spalding 8306N) at a major department store because we wanted something cheap with which to pump up the soccer ball we also bought. I was very annoyed and frustrated to find that as soon as I PUT THE NEEDLE IN THE BALL, air started leaking out of the two holes in the top of the pump, near the handle, before I had even started to pump. So then I thought, maybe it just works like that, so I started pumping, which obviously didn't do anything except let more air out. Now my soccer ball has less air than it did in the store. I'm returning this pump, getting my money back, and buying a pump that hopefully will pump air INTO a ball instead of letting it OUT."
3,Flimsy pump but it does the job,"This is a good cheap pump just to get a basketball inflated. I would not want to use it frequently though... it's just a good pump to throw in your car so if you're at the courts and you realize the ball is flat, you have something to pump it up with."
2,Works great!,"I bring this in my gym bag everytime I play ball. It's light weight & sturdy, so far it works great!12/17/11: After a couple of months, this item did not function anymore."
3,Not so easy to pump balls with,"I spent a minute trying to pump my basketball with this pump. I bounced my basketball and it was still a bit flat. Then, I realized my automatic pump might be able to pump balls too, so I inserted the needle with the electric pump, and within 5 seconds of pumping, the ball bounced like new. I'd recommend a multi purpose electric pump if possible.But you can't beat the price on this pump, just expect some sore arms if you're using this."
1,"See dictionary: ""Garbage""",Please recycle plastic on pump after you take it out of package and throw it away - which is what you will do after trying to use it. Only buy if you enjoy giving money away.
3,"Works OK, But There Are Flaws","I needed a basketball pump to air up a new Spalding basketball I recently purchased. I didn't have much cash on me and this pump was right next to the ball, so I picked it up. I had no trouble airing the basketball up. Many other reviewers at Amazon have complained that the pump leaked air while they were pumping. When I first starting pumping, I had that problem, too. Then I just pushed the needle further down, the ""leak"" stopped and I was able to pump without any problems. However, the needle that comes with this pump is very cheap. It bent while I was airing the basketball up. If you have a basketball that needs to be aired up quickly, this pump isn't a bad purchase, but if you're looking for something longer lasting and more durable I'd suggest looking for a different pump."
2,Ok if you keep pumping,"Something was wrong with the valve on this guy. It would let all of the air out of the ball if you stopped pumping. As long as you pulled the needle from the ball whilst mid-pump, you were fine, otherwise you'd lose some air.I'm not sure if it worked any better when I first bought it."
1,you dont want to buy it,"it's leaking faster than you bumping it in, and so hard to handle the arm, just tough and the quality just sucks ."
2,Broke after 3rd use,"Poor quality pump. Worked well initially, but the needle-type thing broke off while I was pulling it out after the third use or so. Good thing it's cheap i guess."
1,Cheap and worst product i have ever bought,"Bought this at a store not Amazon, but ya this pump pretty much stinks.. You insert the need and it LETS AIR OUT at the top 2 holes of the pump.. You cant pump air in fast enough.. going to go to the gas station and spend 50 cents to pump it up... atleast i got the needle to do it at the gas station right?!? lmao"
1,Did not receive item as shown on website,"I ordered the Bully License plate frame but received one without the word RACING on it. I returned it stating the same and received the same replacement. If you are looking to purchase a Ford License plate frame with only the word Ford on it, there is a cheaper one on the website. I still do not have the one I ordered."
2,Blackadder school of accents.,"This story has some interesting ideas and is refreshingly original, but is let down by poor execution and some silly pantomime-type scenes. There is also a ridiculous scientist whose accent is obviously false that it just becomes laughable. It's not a terrible adventure, but if you want serious sci-fi then avoid it."
2,"""OF COURSE WE SHOULD INTERFERE!""","Writer Bob Baker (Co-creator of K9) goes solo in this story set aboard a space cruise liner. Sadly, the story isn't as strong as it should be, and Tom Baker appears to know it. One of the final scenes when the Doctor discovers, without any explanation to us, that his dog whistle can lure the monsters like the Pied Piper, he manages this terrible level of silliness as they home in on him and he yells off screen, ""My legs! My arms! My everything!"" The story only set the tone for the rest of the season; childish stories."
3,A Doctor Who clash,"While I find a lot of Season 17 stories that get branded as the worst of the worst (Horns of Nimon, Creatures from the Pit, etc.) for being ""too silly"" as it were, I find that taken in the spirit of a good, fun adventure to watch, Season 17 offers a lot of the best around.Sadly, this is the only time where I think the criticism is a little justified. It's supposed to be a more serious story, with a strong drug-running theme, yet it definitely feels like a lot of the cast are putting on a different show to their lines. With the exception of Tom Baker, a lot of those, most notably the bloke playing Tryst, but also the guy who played the lead security guard for example, should've been more along playing the role straight.All in all, not totally bad, i find it enjoyable, but it's definitely jarring. If you're unsure about whether to buyt it, the extras are VERY informative as to why the negative aspect happened, especially about the blow-ups behind the cameras."
4,this isn't released yet,"allz I can say is Lalla needs to get over it(as Myra Fransis said in ""Pit"") though we appreciate her commentry(and it is amusing in a pittable sort of way) that was 30 years ago she broke off with Tom. I was 9! I can't beleive I was even alive in the '70's!"
3,"Adult theme, shame about the producer.","This is a difficult one to review, as it has good and bad points. It has a well-thought-out plot and the adult theme of drug-smugglers is an advantage. It's also very entertaining, certainly one of the better stories of its time.But it's also very silly. What's the point of having an adult plot if it's just going to be played out in a campy fashion? And I don't like the way the Doctor himself behaves in this. He is meant to be a non-violent character and yet gets his robot dog to go around shooting everything that moves, including endangered species such as the Mandrels. I found myself feeling more sympathy for the misguided zoologist Tryst than the Doctor, which surely can't be right.But despite these flaws, this is still a good story and certainly contains more of interest than most of the late seventies/early eighties stories I've seen. And K-9, despite his homicidal tendencies, is actually sufferable, and that must be a rarity."
4,Review after 2 days --- good so far,"Hi,This thing works fine with Windows Media Player 11. (most of the reviews below call out Windows Media Player 10 ).I moved some ripped files over and album art moved over automatically. When the song plays the album cover appear. Very nice.Manual is unreadable. Litteraly. The install disk detected Windows Media Player 11 instead of 10 and aborted. I needed to get into the install disk directory to find a WORD 9 player then naviagte to the manual before I could read how the controls worked. Good thing no drivers needed -- media player recognized the device, downloaded something, then played just fine.I still haven't found out how to move photos over for the screenshow. Looks like a nive feature though. The screen is very nice. BIG for tired eyes.Sound quality is excellent through high end headphones. I haven't tried the ear buds yet."
2,Terrible. Not impressed.,"I am typically a huge fan of Samsung, but this device is a huge disappointment. The command buttons are an incredible pain in the....it seems you have to toggle between actual buttons and an inner touch pad, that also feels like a button but doesn't require a hard press. If you don't hit the touch pad just right, it moves you all around the menu. The buttons are also not very intuitive - what would be standard on most mp3 players doesn't seem to apply to this device. The aesthetics are palatable - nothing very contemporary looking. The screen graphics/font are not that clear. The sound is okay. I really despise the buttons."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I've had this mp3 player since about September of 2006. It's easy to use and very lightweight and small which makes it perfect to use when jogging. The biggest problem is the buttons are very sensitive and I began having problems moving up the menu about six months after I bought it. Now all the buttons are on the fritz. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't. I don't think I did anything major to get them to stop working other than heavy use. As far as battery life, it seems fine to me. It's still on it's original battery and if I charge it for four or five hours I can still get several hours of play from it. And of course you can use it with any of the music services unlike some of the other big name products where you have to go exclusive to their service."
1,failed to work out of the box,"Did my research and read many good reviews. Had good experience with Samsung products before and decided to buy this one. It is probably a good MP3 player in principle, but I never had a chance to enjoy it - its touchpad controls were so miscallibrated that I couldn't even play a song or enter any of the menus. Called up Samsung support and found out that there's no way to re-calibrate the controls, and the player had to be replaced. Decided to return it, as I no longer had any confidence in the product. But it looks cool. Will get a SANDISK Sansa now."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"Bought the Z5 even though I haven't been crazy about Samsung's previous players. The large color screen and long battery life convinced me to take a chance on it. I've had it for a week and I'm very happy with my purchase. I've owned several mp3 players over the years--yes, even the ipod nano--but I think the Z5 might be the easiest to use. It's really responsive and the navigation really makes sense.I wish the Z5 did video, though. Seems like a shame given the Z5's sharp screen. And the name really sucks.My friends actually think the Z5 looks as good as a ipod nano, but I think my nano beats the Z5 on looks. But it doesn't do subscription music like the Z5."
2,Disappointed,"Update as of April 14, 2007. I recently bought Zune and Zune just like IPod does act as a hardrive (You have to use through proprietary software). Since Samsung does, I would change the two stars to three stars. The screen in Zune is nice but there are no movies in the Zune Marketplace which seem like a waste. Overall, if this little player could do video and had better navigation buttons I would give it five stars.Original review:This is my second Samsung (I had two ipods before Samsung). I loved the the first Samsung. Why did they have to change good things about it such as the software or navigation controls? The nice screen is a waste since you can't use it for video. The controls for scrolling up and down are frustrating since you have to press them very lightly. The only reason why I am not giving it one star is that the external design is beatiful."
2,VERY Disappointing,"After two excellent productions, Luis Fonsi's ""Amor Secreto"" falls short in my list. His upcoming launch into the U.S. pop-R&B market has penetrated deep in his musical style, making him sound like a one-man boy band. His lyrics are extremely juvenile (in how many ways can he sing ""I can't forget her""?); songwriting talents don't go beyond the typical teenager's love angsty poems, which is disappointing for a twenty five year old.""Para Vivir"", a song written by Pablo Milanes, stands out as a solid ending, in the same way as ""Seria Facil"" in Eterno, his sophomore production. That and his vocal ability account for the two stars I have awarded this album."
5,I finally understand...,A great handbook that makes understanding pediatric cardiology much easier. Has useful diagrams and and very clear and concise descriptions.
4,Great for what it is,This book really helped me on the Pediatric Cardiology rotation as a med student. It is very pocketable and covers almost every condition or topic I searched for.The only issue is that the detail/depth is kind of lacking--but that's probably because of the small size. It was good enough to get me started; at home I'd look up more about each topic on the web. I also wish it had more EKG primers and examples since that's something that a student would benefit from.
3,Not a bad saddle for the price,"This saddle is more comfortable than the Schwinn saddle that came with my hybrid bike. It's not as soft and comfortable as I that it would be. The material doesn't feel gel like, more like soft leather covered over thin sponge. It is comfortable on my ""sit bones"" and a likely uncomfortable on my ball sacks. I like the way this saddle looks on my bike and I don't feel pain after a long ride. This is not a bad saddle for the price. I spent $22.95 in total."
1,very UNcomfortable,i ordered two of these saddles because they looked nice. What sold me was the hint of red pictured on the saddle. The saddle DID NOT have any red on it what so ever. Also the product is labeled as a Gel seat. it is definatley NOT gel. its just foam.I took the saddles off and switched back to the old ones.
5,New Balance 1122,These model is the apex in shoes for people with high arhces and feet that tend to pronate. I got this shoe because my research found that it would best accommodate orthotics for my high arches. The tech who fitted me with the orthotics had nothing but the best to say for the shoe once he saw then...he was amazed at the ample room and depth in the shoes both in the toebox and in the heel and also the slight bend of the sole to help propel your foot forward when you walk. My orthotics are rather bulky but in spite of them the shoe still provides my feet with enough support and left over space. I usually walk home from work (about 3 miles) and my feet are the least tired thing on me by the time I get home.
2,Great until they fell apart....,"I used these only for walking and took great care of them because I spent more than I normally would for a pair of shoes to get the added support. I had them for 5 months until the back of the bottom of the shoe started to tear off. I am extremely disappointed in the craftsmanship. The shoe does do great things for those of us with flat feet, but they are not cheap to replace every few months.UPDATE: I took them back to New Balance and they gave me the 1123's for free as a replacement. They said they blew out, which is a manufacture falw. So... I am happy! I am going to leave my review for these shoes the same, and I will soon write a review of the 1123's."
2,Boring!!,"Luckily I found this book at the library so at least it didn't cost me any money, just my time. This book started off good, the first 2 or 3 chapters were great, and then I don't know what happened. The only suspense in this entire book is in those first chapters. Don't bother with this one! The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I did somehow manage to finish it."
3,An Quick Enjoyable Read,"The book is a page-turner that keeps you guessing but then again Meltzer develops few characters to point a finger at. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll simply say you won't have enough information to solve this mystery until Meltzer reveals all. The ending had me calling ""foul"". The death was an interesting turn but should of been further developed with a little aftermath of the politics and news frenzy in true Washington style. A little clean up would have went a long way. I think the last chapter was omitted! : ) Grisham is still my man!"
2,"Good book, bad ending","Through this entire book all I could focus on was what a GIANT size mess the character was getting himself into. I couldn't wait for the end to see how it all came together, and most especially, how he survived. I was very, very disappointed. The ending was a copout and lead me to believe that Brad Meltzer himself couldn't write his character out of this awful situation. This was a real let down for me, as I was expecting to be breathless at the end. But, I wasn't breathless at all, I was frustrated and disappointed. It's a good story with a bad ending...I can't, in good faith, tell anyone to read it because if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have."
3,Average at best.,"Another fast read from Mr. Meltzer. Certainly fiction that requires a complete suspension of disbelief.However, all this ground was covered in his most enjoyable ""The Tenth Justice"" with a far more interesting cast of characters and a more subtle plot. This is merely a variation on that theme, and not as well done as the original. Some of the characters are simply cartoonish in their incredulity.I found nothing original here and was underwhelmed."
1,A big disappointment,"Having read Meltzer's other books and enjoyed them I looked forward to his new one. This is totally unrealistic, the plot is contrived, the characters not well drawn at all. One never understands the attraction the main character has for the President's daughter. Very uninspired writing."
5,First Counsel,"Brad Meltzer's latest hit rings with truth. His descriptions of the White House and the White House counsel's office come across as sincere and totally believable; I felt like I knew what it would be like to work there. In addition, the book has a lightening pace, and keeps your attention from the first page to the last. As someone who absolutely loved Meltzer's first book (The Tenth Justice) but was somewhat lukewarm on his second (Dead Even), I was worried that this book might fall flat, but it far exceeded my expecations. The characters are sympathetic and believable, the plot is well-grounded, and the conclusion exciting. I highly recommend this book if you like legal thrillers."
3,"Great Promise, but Character Development was Weak","The action and drama of this book were fantastic. It had great potential. I just couldn't find myself involved enough with the characters to be sympathetic to them. Nora is a flirt with a few good one liners, but I just never got a sense of connection between her and the main character, Michael. I just kept thinking that Michael was a fool, and that I wished that the first Lady, the President, and other characters gave me something to care about. I needed a more compelling argument for Michael's connection to Nora to really care about his sense of purpose. It's good for fast paced page turning, but it is forgettable."
3,A Few Less Words,"I loved ""The Tenth Justice"". Dead Even was OK. Counsel could have been told in about one hundred less pages. I stuck with it through the first 200 pages only because I knew it had to get better. The dialogue is sharp and laughed out loud a couple of times."
5,Thrilling,"A riveting thriller. This is a romantic thriller, a psychological thriller, a political thriller and an action thriller all rolled into one. Probably the best thriller since Craig Furrnas' THE SHAPE. I couldn't put it down."
2,NOT John Grisham,"I bought this book after a review said that Brad Meltzer is the next John Grisham. Not with this one! The plot is ridiculous, the characters are not believable and the plot twists are contrived to keep the story moving towards it's insane conclusion. There are doses are reality in his descriptions of the inside of the White House but you can pick it up on West Wing. I almost put it down after the first ridiculous chapter but kept pressing forward, looking for the talent. Look elsewhere."
2,I expected more from Meltzer,"I agree with the reviewer who said that this book was wrapped up in the end too loosely. The ""answer/killer"" that we're all trying to guess at comes out of left field. And the characterizations aren't good. There are some characters I would like to get to know better. There are some that I couldn't believe existed.But I think the worst part of it all, is that I stopped cheering for the hero. I didn't think he deserved to survive the book."
1,BORING,"This book put me to sleep 3 nights running and I doubt I will finish it. Up to page 200, the plot is unbelievable, the dialogue juvenile, and the book is just plain bad. I can't believe that this book is on the best seller list. Who reads this stuff?"
4,Enjoyably fast paced,"Not the usual historical conspiracy. Real page turner. Thank you Brad for weaving this tale, kept me on my toes"
2,"I didn't think it measured up to Jothanton kellerman, demille or anything else that i had been reading.","I was disappointed with this book. I read it all but, didn't really like it. Will stick to demeille, kellerman and all the others i've been reading."
2,Three's not a charm for Meltzer,"Interesting premise, but no believable connection between the main characters. I did not care for the Prez's daughter or Meltzer's character development of her. The Tenth Justice and Dead Even were MUCH better."
3,Not as good as it could have been...,"I fell in love with Meltzer's writing style in The Tenth Justice but was then disappointed with Dead Even and now with The First Counsel. While the plot was interesting, it was bogged down with poor characterizations and less than interesting conversations. I'll keep reading Meltzer's books, but I hope he finds his initial style again or I might be waiting for the paperback versions..."
1,4 chapters was all I could take.,"I liked DEAD EVEN so am really disappointed in this book. I got whiplash from all the ""bouncy"" dialogue. Next time I hope Meltzer will create characters who are real, sympathetic human beings. I know he's capable of it, because he did it in DEAD EVEN."
1,Disjointed and unappealing,"Having read the reviews for this book, I was expecting something akin to John Grisham's early endeavours. However, I found this book almost painful to read. The lead character is weak, getting duped by everybody he encounters, and not deducing the truth until it is explained to him. The supporting characters are unsympathetic and unlikeable. I thought the First Daughter, Nora, was unconvincing and found it difficult to feel anything for her but annoyance. The plot trips along more like an acid dream than a coherent whole, and at 500+ pages, it lasts too long. Skip this and reread any of Grisham's earlier works, or something by Margaret Truman."
1,Awful,"Don't waste your time with the 500-plus pages of this book, because there's no payoff. The ending was laughably over the top."
1,this book is horrible,"Went to the bookstore, thinking that a book on the bestseller list might have some merit, however, this book failed in every literary capacity. Not only could I not force myself to continue reading at times, when I did I found myself hoping that Brad Meltzer would just stop writing. His plot was interesting, but I found his narrative awkward with a total lack of imagination."
2,Am I the only one who thought this book was lame?,"I had a couple of problems with this book. First of all, after the stage was set with the Edgar Simon/murder situation, I thought the book dragged a great deal before it tightened up in the end. Nora Harston's character was so whacked out, I thought it was a stretch that Michael wanted to have anything to do with her. Also, the witty repartee got a bit old. I lost track of how many times I read ..........he/she ""shoots back."""
4,A great read....,"This is a good book and a great read. Well written with an exciting, engaging plot. Characters were a little flat, otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars."
1,Juvenile,"Not sure what to rail on first, the juvenile prose, the childish dialogue, or the amateurish story line.Instead, I'll just help wary readers. Do NOT waste your time on this garbage."
3,"Not bad, felt it could have been better","I am a fan of Brad Meltzer and the ones I have read already have been amazing. I even watched his show Decoded on History Channel and really enjoyed it. However, this book was a disappointment. The books I have read so far have been his latest ones and I decided to go back and read all of his stuff.That being said, I think I expected more from it. First Counsel was a slow starter and it took awhile to get going. I found myself looking for points in the book to keep going. For example, two more chapters and then I'll stop. Towards the end it did get better and was entertaining and I am still glad I read it.I just hope that his other early works are better, maybe this was just a random instance of mediocrity. Still love his other books and I really enjoy his work with DC comics on Justice League."
3,Good insight into White House,Good story line and interesting insight to White House procedures and stucture. At times confusing as who was talking and ended too abruptly. Not detailed enough as to what happened to some of the characters. Overall good reading. Meltzer did his homework on White House protocol.
2,Not my cup of tea,"Nora, Nora, Nora. I was so sick of her I could scream. The protagonist was written as if he were a 17-year old lovesick smitten puppy. I found the writing somewhat immature. The White House trivia was interesting, but characterizations and a ridiculous wrap-up to the plot left me disappointed."
3,ending needed a little more attention,"I thought the book was pretty good. It was peppy and moved-along pretty well. but then we got toward the end, and it started to lose it's mojo. Pretty good, but would have been better with a re-think of the final 100 pages."
3,"NOT MELTZER'S BEST EFFORT, BUT STILL GOOD","I liked Meltzer's other books better. I had a lot of trouble getting past the nutso first daughter. Kept thinking ""Chelsea Clinton"" and who would want to date her? Lot's going on in these pages but I didn't feel it meshed the way it should have.Still, I whizzed through this book because BM compels you to read further. TENTH JUSTICE is his best effort."
1,I'm a very disappointed Meltzer fan.,"The characters in this book are both good and bad. (Nora is Awesome; everybody else is stupid.) My problem with the book is it's such a downer. If I want to learn that drugs are bad and will ruin my life, I can get that out of my science book. I'm reading fiction cause I want to have fun."
2,Trite and Soap Opera-esque,"A mildly-entertaining, cliche-ridden drugstore rag. Fine for an overseas flight but far from literature."
2,Disappointing,"In my opinion, this book is not for the mature reader. The characters were naive. The main character was not believable. Smoke and mirrors but no real substance."
1,Boring,"This one is very poorly written. The dialogue is sophomoric. The plot meandering and convoluted. There is little that is credible about the events and characters. The politics are only of marginal interest and the ""thriller"" aspect of the novel is extremely disappointing. But in the end the real killer is that one does not at all care about the individuals and their trials and tribulations - the book is simply boring."
1,Hack dimestore novel...,"This book had awkward dialogue, silly relationships, and a tired plot. I listened to this unabridged on books-on-tape and almost fell asleep at the wheel. But, then, I think Meltzer was ""asleep at the wheel"" when he wrote this. My kingdom for some good editing in this one. I enjoyed his first book, but this one is a total waste of time. I predict we'll see this in the bargain bin of the local dimestore."
2,The First (truly stupid) Counsel,"If the real White House hired emotionally ga-ga lawyers like Michael Garrick, the president would be in a heap of trouble. Garrick falls for a whacked out, unstable, First Daughter and then lets her suck him into a self-incriminating situation that, from the outset, clearly jeopardizes his career, not to mention puts him at risk of criminal indictment. What ambitious, political savvy, inside-the-beltway go getter would ever find himself in such a mess?The dialogue is barely adult. It's more typical of sitcom wisecracking among ""Animal House"" fraternity types. The characters are shallow, cardboard cutouts. The plot is so-so (hence two stars rather than one), but is hardly the thriller that some believe it is. I'll give Melzer a point for accurate depictions of Washington neighborhoods and the Metro system. He certainly knows his subway stations."
4,Page Turner,"Loved First Counsel. Hooked me from the get-go, as most Meltzer books do.Mystery, intrigue and history what more do you need in a book!"
2,"An airport read, only if you are desperate.","Warning: I am new to this genre, so my opinion may be worthless. But, as a voracious reader in so many other gneres, I had to comment.How many times did i have to sit through the two main characters having the same argument?How many of those arguments could have been ripped out without having any impact on the book?The characters were flat, the scenes choppy and repetittive at the same time. This was bad television on Kindle.I might try this author again, but I doubt it."
3,Fast beach read,"The White House is not immune to blackmail, drugs and murder and the president's daughter is in the middle of a tight story that weaves these three themes together. In THE FIRST COUNSEL author Brad Meltzer once again uses the first person present tense to keep the reader running fast beside the hero, White House counsel Michael Garrick, as the action races through the D.C. streets, the first family's private residence and a few ""secret"" places. I really enjoyed it."
3,Expected a more believable daughter of the president........,"I thoroughly enjoy reading Brad Meltzer's books. He is an exciting author, never failing to keep your interest heightened to the very last page, but I was frankly very disappointed early on in the daughter of the president. She was just too off the wall to be believable. I'll be looking forward to the next book of his that I can get my hands on, and hope he's back to his more authentic characters."
2,Wishing for More,"I'm sorry to report that I had to literally force myself to finish this novel. I would not have completed it, had I not had to read it for my book club meeting. This was my first novel by Mr. Meltzer and I'm not encouraged to read other works; however, fair is fair and I think he deserves another chance. I found the writing much too heavy with descriptions, the story plot too boring to hold one's attention, and for the most part it was down-right unbelieveable. The main character turns out to be a bit of a sap and can't make smart decisions. His only saving grace is that he's a sweetheart and loves his mentally challenged father. About the only good thing I can say about this book is I found it interesting trying to see if I could readily identify the places in the Washington, DC area that he describes. I hope the next book is a heck of a lot better than this one. Good luck, Mr. Meltzer."
4,Amazing!,"Wow, what an excellant book. I'm a junior in High School. And I am very interested in Law after I graduate. So it was really interesting seeing a book that would talk about the WHite House adn the First Family as well as a mystery and love story. All combined would be aboslutely perfect. I got my teacher to let me read it for extra credit if I explained what it was about after I was done reading it. So I am very excited to finish it up! I would encourage anyone who has the same reading interests as me to go out and read this book! It's a very mind-boggling book and if you like books that you can't put down, this is the perfect book for you! Happy reading!!!!"
3,Suspenseful!,"When White House lawyer Michael Garrick and First Daughter Nora Hartson witness something they weren't supposed to see, Michael is thrown into a vortex of suspicion, murder, and blackmail. Never knowing whose side Nora is on (Michael's or her own), you're never sure whether or not she's actually trying to help Michael or hang him out to dry. When Michael becomes a wanted man (by the FBI) he is on the run and wondering how he is going to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit. The final outcome is neither earth-shattering or riveting, but all in all it was an enjoyable read."
3,"A Disappointing ""Thriller""","Author Meltzer can write, but here we have a very thin plot that is stretched into a novel. We are given NO REASON TO CARE about the characters. The ""fascination"" of a novel ""inside the White House"" soon pales. The author builds suspense before the ""hero"" lawyer makes his first presentation to the president; then he omits the presentation from the book. A lot of ""thrashing"" goes on in this book with no action; a lot of conversation without resolution and without point. Yes, Meltzer can write...let's hope he does, sometime soon."
1,"Mundane, banal and Predictable","This is the sort of book that is quickly written after an author is fortunate to have published one best seller. The characters are one dimensional and totally unbelievable. It is hard to have any compelling interest in Michael Garrick or the Presiden'ts daughter- thus one loses interest quickly in the machinations, contrived suspense and weak plot. I couldn't wait to put it down and only read the last chapter to confirm my suspicions about the ending...A waste of time for an intellectual reader.. pure bubblegum for the tired mind."
3,"Not a terrific book, but certainly not as bad as some say","I'm surprised by the number of 1 star ratings this book received. Those people who say that it is one of the worst books they have ever read must not read much. While it is true that the characters didn't have much depth, and that the ending stretched credibility, the story itself was compelling. Basically, a great story idea with mediocre executation. Still worth reading."
5,Loved it!,"Fast pacing, lots of insider White House information, believable, witty at places (I especially liked that the main presidential opponent was named Bartlett), this book kept me guessing until the last page as to who the bad guy is!P.S. I don't write about the plot - what's the point in reading the book, if it was already digested?"
5,An awesome book!,"If you are bored of those slow moving books, then this is the book you should opt for. A very fast moving book, which keeps the reader at the edge of their seat. You keep reading and before you realize.... you are almost finished. This is one of those rare books that start fast. Mostly all books I have read start so slowly that they steal the reader's interest but this one does not slow for a minute.Very well written and truly shocking. The writer has so much information about the White House that you wonder if it is fiction or real. The characters in the book are mysterious and they reveal themselves very slowly. There are not many descriptions of characters because I think the writer did not even know where to put descriptions in such a fast moving book!Recommended to everybody who likes thrillers, (one of the best in the market). Well Done!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I enjoy political thrillers, but this one doesn't fit the category. It is impossible to develop any interest in any of the characters. I kept waiting for some valid and interesting input from some of the author's knowledgeable advisors, but it never happened. You can find much better political novels on which to spend your time and money."
3,Good Book. Lame Ending,"This book really took hold and wouldn't let go. Couldn't put it down. The exasperating situation of being framed and having nowhere to turn was really felt throughout. The characters were likeable. Overall a fun fast read, until... the end. Maybe I didn't want the suspense to end.The last 40 pages when the chase is wrapping up and the conspirators were revealed, I just lost interest. The suspense and build up was great, the action sequence at the end was bland. I say 6 out of 10 because I did enjoy the story for about 90% of it's pages, but the end was just too flat to say it was a great story."
4,True example of a page-turner,"So well written and clever, I couldn't put it down. It a prime example of a page turner. Went out and bought other Brad Meltzer books and wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, I hope he comes out with a couple more very soon! The First Counsel makes you feel like you're right there with him through everything...your heart will race. Additionally, you'll feel like you have a true understanding of Washington politics, but learn about them the fun way. Highly Recommended!!"
2,The First (truly stupid) Counsel,"If the real White House hired emotionally ga-ga lawyers like Michael Garrick, the president would be in a heap of trouble. Garrick falls for a whacked out, unstable, First Daughter and then lets her suck him into a self-incriminating situation that, from the outset, clearly jeopardizes his career, not to mention puts him at risk of criminal indictment.

4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Brad Meltzer has the makings of a new John Grishman. A legal thriller melded with a conspiracy story, The First Counsel delves into the depths of the White House's legal team.A young lawyer in the counsel's office begins dating the President's daughter. The rumors that she's a sex fiend and a habitual drug user are easily overlooked when he's with such a beautiful woman. But something goes wrong, on their first date, and he finds himself in more trouble than he could have ever imagined.The plot itself is captivating, and what really draws us in, is that the story centers around our favorite address in the world, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave."
4,"Good, but....","I like Brad Meltzer's writing. He shows great promise. But, I have to agree with another reviewer who points out that the main characters in this book act like 19-20 year old college fraternity boys rather than the intellectuals they are supposed to be."
2,Long and pointless - terrible book,What a complete waste of time. Here's what happens: You heft this big book with its mysterious looking photo on the front and start reading. Half way through you realize the plot has gone NOWHERE. All you've gotten is 250 pages of character development and dialog. Zero plot. Zero intrigue. Zero mystery. No excitement and not a clue where this story is heading. It's like Meltzer was writing and couldn't figure out where to take the story. Finally 3/4 of the way through the book you get a glimpse of the plot but it's not until the last 20-30 pages that you actually figure out what the hell is going on! Then it wraps itself up in the last two paragraphs almost instantly! The whole book could've been wrapped up in 150 pages.
1,Two of his books is more than enough,"I tried the 10th Justice and found it sophomoric. I thought this one may be better -- if time and a little more experience could help. It did not. The ""hero"" Michael is conveyed as a 29 year old,top of the heap White House lawyer, but his reactions resemble a naive 13-year-old. This guy's sensitive side gags, rather than charms. The only reason this receives 1 star, is that there is nothing below that to chose."
1,John Pelkey,"I could not finish the book. When whiney Michael said he was OK to the fifth or sixth character introduced, when it was so clear he was not OK, it was too much. His defensive and lost personality as revealed could never have gotten him into the position he was in. All characters should have some flaws, but also some reason to root for them. I couldn't find any reason to root for Michael. It is too bad, as the complexity of the story is great, in complete contrast to the main character."
3,Caught my interest but didn't always hold it,After reading the reviews I expected more. The plot a bit confusing and I did tire of the first person activity. But having said that I did enjoy the book especially the last 100 pages.
1,Don't waste you money.,I think I could learn to put the filter holder in so that the coffee does not run out all over the counter. The reason that I have already junked this coffemaker is that it makes terrible tasting coffee.
5,"Items received, thanks, you gave the best and fastest support, after i requested the follow up you help me a lot thanks again","Items received, thanks, you gave the best and fastest support, after i requested the follow up you help me a lot thanks again"
5,Don't Mess With the Big Dog (or the little dog either),"The Complete Adventures of Big Dog and Little Dog is 5 books in one! Simpler stories (think no Pilkey puns) than other Dav P. books, but just as much fun. Big Dog and Little Dog go for a muddy walk, are sprayed by a skunk, and rip up the sofa. The acrylic and India ink illustrations are straight forward, but clever. I especially like the font that Pilkey created for this book, which is appropriately called ""Big Dog."" Karen Woodworth-Roman"
5,I Love Big Dog a Lot. I Love Little Dog a Lot.,"These stories are a great length and space for little ones. The cadence makes them a fun read for parents, teachers or other loved ones to share with the little ones. The illustrations are simple but endearing. The structure of the book as a lot of little short stories -- each with a definite ending yet feeding into the next story -- works really well. As an adult who read this without children present I found it completely engaging and endearing. This is also a good book for early readers to practice their new skill since there is a good mix of repetition and new words."
4,Hello Robert Holmes!,"The Krotons is one of the few Troughton stories that is complete in the BBC Archives. While not a great story, it has one thing going for it, besides the fact that it is a complete story. And that is the fact that it is the first story written by the great Robert Holmes."
3,Being smart only causes trouble,"This one was a bit weirder. Created out of episodes 6.19-6.22, story 47 was okay. Stupid Zoe doesn't know how to follow the Doctor's orders."
4,More in ShippingCare,"Product, video DVD, arrived with broken jewel case. In standard mailer and unmarked. Understand marking as video attracks theft, but maybe marking as fragile would help. DVD fine antd I have another jewel box for it, but was a bit scary for a few seconds when I thought the DVD might have been affected."
5,A rare gem from the BBC archive,"The TARDIS lands on earth.The Doctor goes off looking for a friend.Instead he meets up with Briadier Lethbridge Stewart(he was colonel in the Web of Fear"".The search takes the Doctor to a electronic manafacture factory.The Doctor and UNIT lattert discover the Cybermen are plotting to take over the earth.The Doctor with UNIT defeats the Cybermen. To make up for the missing footage Nichlas Courtney narrates the lost episodes.It's too bad we could not see the whole episode in it's whole form, but what we have more than makes up for it!"
4,A quintessential Troughton story,"A quintessential Troughton story, which means, among other things, scary monsters (the Cybermen), missing episodes (1 and 4), and lots of padding (especially in episodes 2, 3, and 5). It also means that Troughton's considerable acting skill carries it for most of its 8 episodes. But there are other goodies here. The Cybermen seem almost incidental to the plot, but microchip monopolist Tobias Vaughn dominates most of the scenes he's in, and his henchman Packer is also quite entertaining. And episode 6 (aside from one outrageous cop-out -- you'll know it when you see it) is an outright classic. Troughton fans (I'm one) should own it. UNIT fans (I'm one) should own it, although it's not really like the Pertwee UNIT stories. But the merely curious might want to try ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" first."
4,Dr Who never disappoints,I am an avid Dr Who fan since I watched the fist episode in 1964. Whilst the early sets and effects are quite primitive now these episodes were made on a shoestring budget. This episode is a favourite as it has the second Dr Who (Patrick Troughton)against his enduring old foe the cybermen.
2,Long and Repetitive,"Although the villain in the story is quite unique and wonderfully-played, this story lacks adventure, interesting dialogue, and has 4 episodes too many. Like many Troughten adventures, his serials were known to be long; a mistake that causes many of his stories to suffer in excitement.However, if you are a Troughten fan, you will probably love this story. For the first time we see Cybermen react to fear and emotions. It was very interesting to see their reactions to these new emotions.But, the Cybermen dialogue sufferes greatly in the episode and is very difficult to understand. If you want to see Cybermen at their best, I recommend you purchase ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" or even the Fourth Doctor serial ""Revenge of the Cybermen."" If you want to see Troughten at his best, I would purchase ""The War Games"" or ""The Krotons."""
4,Don't trust your government officals,"I'm so glad the added the animated bits. When they had just the sound bites for one of the first Doctor's DVDs, i'll admit I kept falling asleep because i couldn't pay attention. And i love the animation style they used. Made it more interesting. Nice story line consisting of season 6, episodes 11-18 (story 46)."
3,"Long, but good.","Largely regarged as a classic, The Invasion is nonetheless interesting. The plot is slightly original, although the Cybermen's voices seem wrong. At eight episodes (two missing) it is certainly stretched, but the scene at the end of part 6 of invading Cybermen marching relentlessly through the streets of London must have had children utterly terrified on first transmission. Great, but not too great."
2,What do you expect for $23,"I bought this muffler thinking that it would be very good quality b/c of some of the other reviews I read about it. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality but as the title of the review says.....Anyway, I took it to a muffler shop and the guy told me that trying to weld hangers onto this muffler there is a very good possibility that he'd burn through the material b/c it's so thin. I really can't say much else about it. Unfortunately, this will probably be something that sits in the garage until one day I can mount it to a lawn mower....LOL!"
5,really great choice for a really great price.,i got this muffler for my 4.3L chevy blazer and had it installed with a new high flow cat. it has a great deep sound when im driving in town and you can barely hear it driving down the highway.
3,A Bit Too Noisy for OEM,"I bought this muffler as a replacement for an OEM stock GM truck, from the 1950's. It is good quality construction for a basic-style muffler. Mine had the 2 1/4"" inlet and outlet, and installation was a snap. However after driving with it for the first time, it has more of a loud 'thoaty' sound...especially at higher RPM's and speed. Not what I was wanting to hear. It does not have the quieter OEM factory sound like the older muffler did. If you want muscle or hot-rod sound, this muffler will do just fine; just wasn't what I was looking for."
5,Perfect sound at a good price.,"I was pleasantly surprised after installing these on my 302 powered LTD. They have a deep aggressive rumble during acceleration but are nice and quiet going down the highway. The best of both worlds, nice sound but not obnoxious, they are exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price."
2,"uses only food items, highly perishable recipes","I was disappointed with this book. Not only are there very few recipes listed, but ALL of them are extremely perishable and must be used with 1-2 days of making them. They all use food items as well. If I had known the recipes were of this type, I would not have been so disappointed, but the book was simply NOT billed that way, especially by looking at the cover.I like to make my skin care items ahead and use them for at least a month or two at a time. These recipes do not allow for this. You're better off buying a book with at least a variety of perishable and non-perishable recipes."
5,What Estee Lauder won't tell you,"I was given this book by a friend while I was living in Europe. Unable to get my usual brands of skin care products, my friend gave me a beautiful basket which contained the book and many of the herbs called for in the book. What a wonderful gift. I have used Kathlyn Quatrochi's reciepes for years now and would never dream of going back to ""over the counter"" brand names. While it's true that the products have a somewhat short shelf life, I, personally, enjoy the ""me"" time. I also, and I can't stress this enough, LOVE the fact that most of the reciepes call for 3 or 4 simple ingredients and no dyes, perfumes, or chemicals that I can't pronounce. This book is a trip to the spa every time you open it! I wouldn't be without it."
3,It's OK,Could use more info to be truly great. The information contained was adequate but the book was very short on useful recipes..
1,how to book for photographers,"This book is a film based book, and while there is some solid information, it is outdated in this digital age."
4,An easy recommended read for beginners,"The writing is above average and mostly interesting. Photos are good to very good. Finally a book with tables with practical information, such as recommendend exposures for low-light situations or reciprocity failures (though most of the films are unfortunately not sold anymore, such as Kodachrome 64). Highly recommended for beginners, recommended for medium level photographers."
3,More winning pictures needed,"This book is essentially true to its title of the Art of Outdoor Photography as opposed to the science of... The author offers a lucid and accessible narrative which could offer insights for beginner or intermediate photographers. However, I felt that many of the pictures in the book were quite frankly not impressive or inspiring. It is almost as if he was only willing to part with those that he didn't want to sell elsewhere. Could be useful as part of a larger collection of books on this subject but look elsewhere for stunning photographs."
5,Strategies for Teaching Students with Learning and Behavior Problems 7th Edition,"I am very impressed with this text by authors Vaughn and Bos. The 8th edition was what I was told to purchase, but I ended up with this 7th edition because the instructor liked the fact that this text discusses the transition planning process. I find the book easy to understand. It is just so schock full of information. I am learning so much about Special Education in this my first class."
4,school book,This is one of the better books I have seen for my program. It is full of strategies and information I will be able to use even throughout my career.
5,Strategies for Teaching Students with Learning and Behavior Problems,"This paperback textbook was required for a college course. I like the way it is formatted, with focus questions and intervention strategies on each topic. I have already used it as a resource for another class. I ordered it used (""like new condition"") through one of Amazon's vendors. It was much less expensive than it was in the college bookstore. It was delivered sooner than I expected and was in new condition."
5,textbook review,Text book was in very good condition just like was advertised. Very quick and easy transaction and book arrived promptly.
3,A copy of a book?,"The content of the book is standard. Fairly easy to read, pretty straightforward, etc. However, some of my classmates ordered the real book, and it looked different than mine. Upon further inspection, it appears I have paid full price for a copied version of the book! The cover art is smudgy looking, and the pictures, charts, and graphs inside are black and white instead of color like in the real version."
1,no idea how it works,I bought this because it appeared to be a mug but it somehow is meant to attach to a blender but not mine that I can see. Frankly I want to send it back.
5,1 OF THE BEST SHOWS I HAVE SEEN,"This was one of the best series I have seen in a long long time. I am NOT a yankees fan at all (its the mets for me), however, i was very impressed with the history of the team portrayed in this mini-series. The acting was excellent; the mingling of the ""real-life"" footage with the tv show made this show even more credible. You can actually get chills watching the scenes of the baseball games when they go back & forth with the real games and the acted ones - Besides loving the show, I looked forward each week to the ""back-story"" even more. Although I do love baseball, what makes this series so interesting, is all the other stories going on, other than baseball. I hope this series gets nominated for an emmy and certainly the actors deserve nominations as well! I only wish it wasn't over! Excellent, excellent, excellent!"
5,Like Real Movie!,"I just received this DVD case other day, I tried finding CC (closed captioning) to see if it was available, but I could not access it. This DVD case in back shows me ""CC"", but it is impossible for the deaf and hard of people to understand voice words in the screen. I assume that I will keep this one because the price was too low to be paid to the merchant. It is not their fault. I have to rate 5 stars because these 3 DVD discs are in excellent condition. I do recommend this to anyone."
5,yankees,i bought this as a gift for my oldest son who is a yankee fan. its a great video on the yankees
5,Yankee history,"Great movie about the other side of baseball most fans dont' know or think about. Great story of a baseball dynasty. Ball players from that era, we will most likly never see again. And a great manager, Billy Martin. Best part for me: LOU PINIELLA!Lou has become one of the greatest minds and deans of the sport. Cub fans are greatful to have him as our manager."
5,yankee fan,I received the dvd's very fast and they are in mint condition. I would do business with this company again. thank you
5,Great Seller A+++,"The seller had the product sent to me in the quoted time frame, and the condition was just as described.No nonsense here, this was a great transaction."
2,Great info buried in to many unnecessary pages,"At 459 mind numbing pages I would suggest saving yourself about 15 hours of reading time and pick up ""Stress free for good"" by Luskin and Pelletier, both books have the same goal to reduce your perpetual stress mode, both authors have the same basic credentials however this book (Undoing perpetual stress) goes on and on about the author, his last book, his theories about stress, and all his opinions. ""Stress free for good"" gives you quick principle to use now. Buy this book if you find stress incredible fascinating and would like to study it for 15 hours. The book is sound scientifically and has a lot of great points, but who has time to read a big scientific book when you are looking for relief from stress now? This book stressed me out."
2,Disapointed,"I read two of O'Connor's other books Undoing Depression and The Active Treatment of Depression. They were great. Undoing Depression is probably still the best, most helpful book on depression I have read. But this book was torturous. I felt buried in a cosmic morass of studies, books, scientific articles, and case studies. The Active Treatment of Depression was written for professional therapists (which I am not), so it was not easy reading. But at least it was focused and directed.As much as I like O'Connor and as much as his other books have helped my depression, I have to say pass on this one."
3,One's relationship with God,"I was astonished when I read page 447: ""Those who say they are indifferent (to God) are usually angry or contemptuous, and that's a problem.""In light of all the anger and contempt we see today from those who are definitely not indifferent to God, I see more peace, kindness and health elsewhere. I think this particular writing expresses a personal and unprofessional bias for a psychologist."
3,Tough but fun,"This is a tough puzzle, fun for the whole family. If you have someone that enjoys difficult puzzles this one is pretty cool."
2,Too Easy,"I am a huge fan of thinkfun games because they are very educational and get kids to think ""outside of the box"", this however, was probably the worst Thinkfun game I've purchased. Unlike most thinkfun games, where you progress through different levels, this one only has one solution, which is difficult to solve so takes about 15 minutes, but once the kids find the solution the game is useless and boring.ThinkFun Rush Houris a much better game to buy because there are multiple levels and once you have mastered them there are expansion packs available."
4,Read the description carefully,"Despite the word ""capsized"" in the two different descriptions of the game, this game does not tip. I guess I imagined it, from the description, to be a weight balancing challenge -- it is not. It's more like a jigsaw puzzle where each piece can fit in more than one place, but there is only one solution which has all pieces in the right place. Perhaps I should have read the description more carefully.That said, the game is great. My five year old son was hooked instantly and is still puzzling over it. My husband and I liked it too. Wasn't awfully had for an adult to figure out, but it is an 8-and-up game, after all. Wish it came with a carry bag as many Think Fun games do. Great for restaurants, airplanes, waiting rooms, etc."
4,"Beautifully illustrated, eclectic mix","This is collection of poems written about the nature of poetry by various authors (some of them award-winning). Some of the poems are insightful and others are trite, but the illustrations are beautiful. Overall, the book has merit as a springboard the imaginations of budding young poets, and a creative introduction to poetical analysis."
4,Good for slow digestion.,"The pills work like a cleanse. I have slow digestion and sometimes need a kick-these did the job. The only thing I don't like is having to take pills. It can cause gag reflex and make them unbearable but overall, they did a good job of cleaning me out. I had to cut down on the amount per day because they can work too much at times and that's uncomfortable. You know what your body needs and can adjust your intake accordingly. Plus they are gluten free which is a plus for anyone with special dietary needs."
2,Ineffective,"I have chronic GI issues and Acidophilus and Bifidobacterium supplements along with a Gluten and Dairy free diet usually do the trick. Unfortunately, I bought a couple of large bottles of Power Dophilus and have been taking them for multiple months and my symptoms that are usually suppressed have come back. I am sure that these supplements work for some people but are ineffective when it comes to keeping my GI system in check."
5,A must have for any organized witch...,"This is a very well put together date book- not only is there plenty of room for jotting down appointments as well as notes on the daily calendar pages, but it also includes a 'month at a glance' section for each month. Also included are major and minor 'power days' for working certain spells, AND shaded areas on the 'month at a glance' so one can see AT A GLANCE the waxing/waning phases of the moon. I must add, the art is lovely and all the little extras make it worth EVERY penny."
5,"Excellent photos, a great resource!","This hard-to-find volume of color photographs, many of which I believe were produced by the Regia Anglorum, are well worth the purchase price of this book - especially if you're a re-enactor. You can see details quite well, and if you're wanting to make your own Norse crafts this is an excellent resource. Don't pass it up!"
3,Good but not perfect reenactor reference,"Like Embleton's other Europa Militaria title, Medieval Military Costume, this book is informative and crammed with glorious full-color photographs of serious reenactors. However, because there is less definitive information available about Viking-period reenactment, particularly about period costume, some of the photographs are misleading (for example, a number of the women depicted wear the ""two pieces of cloth"" recreated style of apron dress, a version which arose from a mistranslation and has now been generally discredited). Still, the book is inspiring, and I'm glad I own a copy."
5,"If you thought Ensiferum perished, think again...","The vocalist returns to bring total mayhem. There is still some folk injected, but not as much as Ensiferum's stuff. It's highly melodic, most definitely melodic death. If you are into Finnish metal as well as Swedish, you need to get this."
5,Damn cool.,"I heard these guys a little bit on youtube. They sounded pretty cool by what I could tell.This cd is very good, as it has most that I look for being fast, melodic, and epic. The singer sings normal, death (growling), and even a little narration, which adds diversity. The music itself is relatively fast, and barely lets up, which could get kind of annoying and make you want to switch cd's some times. But, if fast is your thing, you won't be disappointed with Wintersun. They seem to have elements of bands like Death, Rhapsody, and Bal-Sagoth, but with a hint of folk.This is one of my more favorite albums at the moment. Just about every song has something in it that you look forward to. Making the album good in it's entirety. If you liked ""Death"" these guys are just bigger and also have some regular singing with backup that really makes you feel like you're in some lost wintery temple."
5,Amazing!,"This album is amazingly epic. Jari Mäenpää's musical genius is apparent in every track; especially because he did everything on this album, besides the drums --he even produced it himself. Jari mixes in clean vocals (which are some of the best clean vocals in metal) with growls, and packages it all up with great melodies and killer guitar solos. The end product is an album that is emotionally effective, heroic, uplifting, morbid, and just pure awesome. Not only is the music out of this world, but the lyrics are well written and powerful.I'm a big fan of Finnish metal; and if you like other Finnish bands, chances are you'll like Wintersun. If you aren't a fan of Finnish metal, this album will probably get you hooked."
5,Ensiferum's Jari Maenpaa sure does have talent!,"For melodic metal fans that are looking for a new favorite cd, look no further. If you have ever heard of or listen to Ensiferum, well, their main man Jari Maenpaa decided to go off and do his own solo work, and thus Wintersun emerges! Writing the lyrics and music for the guitars and keyboards, with Kai Hahto writing and playing the drums, he definitely made a good choice, though Ensiferum was awesome as well. The best way for me to describe the music style is to say it's a close cross of Children of Bodom's style of music and Yngwie Malmsteen's radical guitar style of music, and it definitely comes together to sound unique. As far as vocals, Jari has an excellent growl and surprisingly just as good clean vocal style. 5 of 5 for the excellent writing and performance. Melo-metal fans, give 'em a try..."
4,A perfect overview and starting point!,"This book was understandable since it lacked scientific jargon. It was still in depth and expository without containing too many confusing statements that so many other archeological books heavily rely upon. The text was arranged in an organized way and covered a very wide topic area. This book was interesting from beginning to end and the various pictures added the pugnancy of the book's texts tremendously. My ONLY criticism of this book is the mention of biblical topics somewhat frequently and the over use of the word 'antiquites'! Yet, it gave a flavor of different ancient worlds and explained archeology quite nicely. Overall it was a very good read."
1,Dribel,"History re-interpreted with a leftist socially engineered slant, especially the ""circuit"" and ""It's about freedom"" keep your kids away from this garbage unless you want them to begin to grow up with a skewed view of actual history."
5,Great for relaxation and meditation,I love the cd it is amazing!i use it quite often for listening to after a guided meditation. i also will just throw it on when i want to relax. a friend has started using it for when she dose massage.give it a listen!
5,Great CD!,This CD is very relaxing and provides the opportunity for deep relaxation. The tracks are varied so give options that are appreciated.
4,New to Tibetan music,"Not knowing what to expect with the purchase of this cd, I decided to buy anyway. I was/am looking for meditative music to practice Qi Qong. I like this cd, but will try different styles/sounds in the future. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an interesting sound. I prefer the selections with music included. The bowl sounds by themselves aren't for me."
5,beautiful,"I bought this solely based on other's reviews. I listened to the preview and loved it. This album is absolutely beautiful. I use it for meditation and when I'm working and need to really focus. I can't describe in words exactly but the vibrations of the bowls are so unique, soothing and healing...it sends vibrations up and down."
2,Just Fair,"The problem with these pieces is that they seemed designed for those with short attention spans, or those who don't want to spend any serious time with healing/meditating sound.At the point where I've begun to settle into one of them, it ends and there's a new track. A couple of them are downright grating, to the point where I can't listen to them.If you're looking for something that takes you deeper, consider ""Sounds of Light: Crystal Voices"" by Van Dyke and Farnsworth, or ""Singing Bowls of Shangri-La."" The latter, by Steven Halpern, a well-known musician and sound healer, is well worth your time.Also note that there is a profound sonic difference between crystal bowls and metal bowls. I like them both, but find the crystal bowls generally more pleasant and relaxing from an audio perspective."
2,OK Product but wear gloves to open it,This is a cable. It is meant to connect to devices. Connecting the should take seconds and opening the package even less. I used kitchen scissors and I still needed 2 minutes to get into the packaging. In connecting the DVI end I found that the screws were not long enough to reach the holes in the connector on the Samsung TV. A few seconds with a modelling knife on the lugs and I was OK but what a pain. Quality good and the image quality what I expected.
2,Work after 3 cables,"I purchased this cable to hook my Dell XPS m1710 to my Mitsubishi 720p projector. The first cable i got was showing a red distorted picture on my projector and no picture at all on my samsung lcd panel.I went to exange the cable and got one wich was working but there were no blue color on the screen. So i went to get my money back but they insist on trying a third cable, testing it on their own laptop and screen in the store. I was working goog this time.I may have bough 2 cable that had problem in the manufacturing process, maybe the only 2 bad cable in the line but it was very frustrating.I agreed with the reviewer complaining about the package. There is an easy pull tab on the rear of the package, but it only give you acces to the middle of the cable, the connector are stuck in the front of the packaging, so you have to use a combination of knife, scissor and patience to pull it out, very frustrating after the 3rd time.No more belkin cables for me, never again."
5,good purchase,"like the length, like the look, works great. feels heavy duty, but doesn't look too bulky or ugly/in the way."
4,nice bag... but,"It is a very nice bag - nice pattern, many pockets inside and out, holds adult water bottles, and stands upright. I gave it 4 starts because 1)it's on the heavy side - 3 LBS. may not be a big deal for some people 2)the pockets and linings are plastic instead of nylon fabric or mesh. So they are not see-thru and are stiffer 3)sturdy like luggage material so it is not the most stuff-able.Overall a great bag. I especially like the neutral pattern."
3,"""Are there Lords in such a small domain?""","""Enlightenment"" concludes a rather odd trilogy, 'The Reurn of the Black Guardian'. Mark Strickson shines in his OTT performance.There's a lot of charming moments, but also has a minor incosequential feel about it. The setting on board the ships is done very well. The Immortals are chilling cool. Although I do sense a lot of hidden sexual references throughout. We also see the White Guardian making his return since ""The Ribos Operation"", but we don't really find out a whole lot from both these Guardians. A little odd at times, probably because of the originality of the story, but worthy."
3,Subscription,"This is a great resource, but after a year you can no longer access the information on your PDA. You are only buying a 1-year subscription. I got burned by this. I was truly only interested in one city but it would have been better for me to get the book version so that I still had the information."
5,Tom Baker doctor who story.,"A VERY WELL DONE ENJOYABLE STORY,IN EVERY WAY WELL WORTH IT FOR THE DOCTOR WHO COLLECTOR."
3,Doctor Who Image of The Fendahl,The tome baker years started off with plenty of science fiction and humor turned to darker more supernatural stories such as this one about a group of scientists trying to prove that life on earth originated in space plan to sacrifice one of their own in a ritual to prove it. When start out with a study of an haunted skull and investigation in spooky night scenes described wonderfully with the commentary piece turn out with a threat to the world if the doctor and recent companion Leela don't put a stop to it.
1,beware!,"Nothing against this story, but beware this DVD. I've bought it from amazon three times now, and each time it's arrived loose in the box and consequently scratched up. I've bought a lot of Doctor Who DVD's over the years, and it's the first time I've had this experience. Send this one back to the drawing board, or buy locally where you can shake the box to make sure it's secure."
4,X-FILES BEFORE THERE WAS AN X-FILES,"A fond fave from Tom Baker's run. Well-acted, chilling stuff. Juicy dialogue, fun interactions between characters, and nice ways of working around a limited budget. The plot concepts are intriguing, too. The Doctor addressing the cows is one of my favorite scenes in all WHO. Recommended!"
3,"""How do you kill death itself?""","Could a 12 million year old human skull be the key to how humans evolved? ""Image of the Fendahl"" is a great horror story. The pace and execution of this story is very different from a lot of Who stories, it has the feel of an ""X-Files"" episode. ""Image..."" also contains some extreme violence(extreme for the Graham Williams eara). Max shooting Stahlman in the head is quite chilling. It's got sort of a pedestrian pace, and a little padding here and there, but never lets you down."
5,Great product,"Really good product, works well, placement is important and make sure you adjust the tigger level"
5,refil china markers!,"working in a restaurant we use China markers for a handful of reasons, having the listo refillable markers saves us a lot of money and time."
3,Jim Otto and the Oakland Raiders,"This is an interesting read for a Raiders or an AFL fan, but it doesn't flow well at all, is circular at times and can be choppy. Being a Chiefs fan and knowing the Raider greats, I found it interesting to learn more about the great Jim Otto personally, but the book is not that well written. Jim Otto's physical trama and pain tolerance in the AFL must have been unbelieveable! What a tough guy!!"
5,Excellent football book!,"A great football, as well as a great Raiders, book. All football fans will enjoy this simple yet articulate story of one of the true iron men in professional athletics history. Raiders fans will enjoy it for some insight into the early history of the team as Jim Otto was there from day one. Very humourous as well! Jim Ottos is a walking miracle. Highly enjoyable & highly recommended!"
5,Life saver,"This is so helpful. It is the first thing I have gotten that my family understands what to do with drippings and grease. No more lost in the back jars of gunk, no more grease smelling the waste basket and no more clogged sinks."
5,neat and compact,i love this container. it holds a lot of grease. i keep it in the refrigerator until it's full so the grease can solidify just in case it gets knocked over. i got tired of looking for things to put grease in to dispose of it. it's a a simple solution for a common problem. i also like that there's no odor and the container washes easily.
5,Great idea!,This product makes life so much easier. We love it - no more stinky can in the garbage. A great buy.
1,Great speakers but BAD QUALITY!!!,"I love this speaker... if it works!I sent mine in for an exchange because it was part of the lot that has a defective chip. The whole process took about two weeks. The ""new"" turns out to also be defective! It produces a high pitched noise even when the iPod is not connected. It turns out that they replaced my previous one with another of the same lot that has a defective chip!I tried calling their customer service but had difficulty reaching them. The good news is that their web based exchange for the item works flawlessly. The bad news is that you may have to use it more than one!Buyers beware."
1,It's too bad...,"Aesthetically, this has a nice design, and well in keeping with the ""iPod look."" The sound wasn't too bad, either, though not noticeably better than the PC speakers that came with my computer five years ago, which it was supposed to replace. It's too bad that it has such a serious technical design flaw.I went through two of these before I gave up and decided to find a more reliable product. With both units, the problem was the same: after a few uses, it started playing with increasing static and a loud popping noise whenever I tried to change the volume. In other words, it was fried.Some research on the Web showed that this happens when you plug the iPod in while the On Stage speakers are powered on. Gee, I wonder how many people did that without thinking twice? Apparently, quite a few.I expect better for a consumer device that is supposed to illustrate simplicity and ease of use. Find something that you can use without having safety instructions pasted on the wall above it."
4,great gizmo complements ipod nicely,"Great sound from this small device. Lots of clarity, plenty of bass. Sounds like the music is coming from something MUCH bigger. A minimal amount of distortion when playing certain songs really loud, but an EQ adjustment fixed that. Thoughtful and intuitive design make this surprisingly easy to use...it's really a gadget-lover's dream. I haven't heard the Bose, but I am plenty satisfied with this...it was far less expensive, and far MORE portable. I am in Iraq, and I will definitely be traveling with it. I'll follow up if there are any problems that others experienced."
4,Juan Jose Guardado,"Good set of speakers, specially the doughtnut-shape that it has, and I love it for that.I'm giving for stars because of the sound, because its a good quatlity of sound but it doesn't compare with the Bose Speakers for the Ipod.But i'm pretty much satisfy with the On Stage that I bought, the only I'm hoping for is that my On Stage doesn't break down."
1,Worked for a day..,I got the on stage for Christmas and by the following day it was worthless...the speakers were all static and the volume buttons didn't work. I returned it thinking I must have gotten a bad one but the same thing happened with my second one about a week after I exchanged the first...I was even being extra cautious. Too bad because it does look and sound good when working...
1,Broken after one day!,I certainly don't know if mine was just a lemon or not but after getting the JBL ONSTAGE for Christmas I brought it into my office and for one day it was great. On day two when I turned it on the volume was maxed out and the volume controls no longer worked.My guess would be that JBL pushed this brand new product out a little to early to try to catch the holiday iPod frenzy.
4,speakers for i-pod,"These are amazingly well adapted to the i-pod and creative zen products.I am more than pleased with them,and I have found that amazon price is nearly 70 dollars less than Sharper Image or Apple"
4,"Great for frequent travelers, but....","Terriffic unit with great sound. Super for making life in hotels a bit more home-like.However, has some potentially meaningful shortcomings:1. The power adapter is unusually large and heavy (weighs more than the On-Stage unit itself) and it doesn't work with 220 volt electrical systems. Therefore, to use in Europe and Asia, you'll need a step-down voltage transformer, thus adding to the weight and bulk of the total package.2. When used with a remote control (e.g. Griffin i-Click), volume commands don't work if unit is in the charging dock. For volume control to work, must use provided audio-in cable to connect iPod to On-Stage unit.Bottom line, though, these are fairly minor considerations when compared to the overall benefits of the unit -- primarily compact and attractive form factor, good clear sound with respectable bass and not having to wear earphones in order to enjoy your iPod."
3,Nice...when it worked,I too experienced a defect within hours of operation where the volume controls became non-respondent leaving the volume frozen at MAXIMUM. Not real happy to ship a new product back to the factory for repair or replacement. And after reading of others who experienced the same problem will this happen again?I hope JBL fixes this volume control bug.
2,Great sound when it works,"The sound is better than that from the Bose competitor. However, I have experienced two infuriating problems:Firstly, if you have the classic iPod (the one with the round toggle wheel) you will need to insert a wire from the top of the iPod into the base of the speaker. The picture doesn't show you this. This wire comes wrapped up with the JBL speaker system but due to the fact that the wire comes tightly wrapped you sometimes will experience sound loss and will have to jiggle the wire to get the sound to kick back in. Reallyannoying.Secondly, the iPod adapter (the plastic thingy that your ipod sits in while it plays)that comes with the JBL speakers is not a perfect fit for the classic iPod. This means you will have to stuff something behind it (I use a tissue) to make sure the iPod docks accurately into the speaker system so that you get a good jbl/iPod connection. Otherwise the sound fades in and out. Really annoying."
1,A speaker too sophisticated for its own good,"This speaker is an excellent example of over-complicating a simple thing. The speakers themselves are great - when they worked. The problem is that the volume controls are touch-sensitive and apparently it is really easy to short them out - I did it by putting my already playing iPod in the On Stage dock when it also was turned on. The result was that the speakers maxed out. I immediately pulled out the iPod and tried to mute the resulting static as well as lower the volume, but to no avail. If JBL had merely put a regular volume control instead, it probably would not short out (and been easier to tell what the volume was set to). If only I had paid heed to the other reviewers on Amazon.... If you have to have these, definitely wait until they are redesigned, otherwise you'll be returning them as well."
2,Has its problems,"The problem I have with this little b*gger is if there's a weak current, it switches itself off. I live in an old building with cr*p electricity so it's always switching off. Then, when it gets a phantom electricity charge, it switches itself back on: at full volume blast!So I have to constantly get up and go across the room and adjust things."
3,Product ok but Wholesale AV is awful,I ordered 2 units from Wholesale AV more than 6 weeks before the holiday. They confirmed the purchase and shipment. However they shipped only one unit. It wasn't until after the holiday they admitted they didn't have any more units in inventory.You can't wrap an apology and present it to your daughter for the holidays!Not only am I upset with Wholesale AV but Amazon needs to be more selective who they include in their affinity program!
2,"Good sound, but newer iPods won't work with it...(2012 revision)",...I bought it for my iPod 60Gb - no not the video one - the big one for audio & stills only which has a larger body.I like the sound from it and the size for throwing in a bag to take to work.(This was originally posted in 2006..).If it isn't just perfectly mated to my iPod - no sound comes out. I did not buy the $40 remote that comes with the de luxe version and that is okay.So if I go select another file on my iPod while astride this thang - after I have done so - the connection gets loose and I have to fiddle to re-adjust the iPod.I can't help but wonder if I am bending or hurting my iPod' bottom port in doing so. They did supply about 3 plastic inserts - all for Nano or other models. I have to use my ipod stuck in with an adaptor - won't fit.So if you have an iPod - go see this in a store to see if your unit fits before buying it here. And the BEST PRICE that I have seen for it IS on Amazon.com!
3,OK,"Disappointed that the Speakers only came with a US power supply - no mention of this in description.. I travel a lot and had to buy a power supply from the JBL parts supplier in the UK and it cost me 30.. (50% of the list price) My laptop, mobile phone and IPAQ all have universal power supplies.. JBL save a few cents on unit cost but a lot of hassel and customer disatisfaction!! Speaker Quality OK.."
1,JBL iPod speaker,"It worked great for four days,then I left the power on but shut the iPod off for 2 hours and when I turned the iPod on I could only get stadic. It never worked agin."
1,Worked for 2 weeks,I got the on stage for Christmas the speakers were all static and the volume buttons didn't work after a couple of weeks.Hopefully the replacement works not like the other bad review I saw on Amazon from Javier on 1/6/05.
3,Help... USB Device not recognized,"I purchased this at the local store together with a new ipod. They are sold together at a discount. I haven't experienced the volume problem described by others, and the quality is pretty good. One problem though, when I dock my ipod in it and connect it to my computer using the USB cable, I keep getting the ""USB device not recognized"" bubble. This one is supposed to work as a substitute for an ipod dock... Anyway, still not bad."
1,Great... When it works.,"The sound quality is great, for the price. Problem is that the product only works (plays songs) sometimes. Besides volume, there is only one button - power. With so few variables, it is baffling why the audio works sometimes when my iPod is docked, but not always. If I use the audio in port in the back, audio always seems to work, and the charging functionality always works, but playing music from an iPod through the dock is what gives this product it's primary value. The symptoms I've experienced sound a lot like those described by JBLs product recall, but my Onstage serial number wasn't covered by it. I don't know whether this has been fixed with the newer version of the Onstage."
1,Worst Product Ever!,"After two days of use, the volume controls no longer worked, the sound was distorted and it overheated when left plugged in. Meanwhile, my Altec Lansings are still going strong after seven months of taking them back and fourth to work everyday and serving as my alarm clock every morning. I bought this piece of crap for my kitchen and I was hoping for better sound quality. Well, I had it - for two days!! Sent it back and bought the latest Altec model coming out next week. I'm sure it will be worlds better. Do Not Buy!!!"
4,great when it works,"I have the newest of the JBL. I was going to get the JBL II w/ the remote but thought abt saving money. They are amazing speakers - they can play amazingly loud for such a small device. I have all docking parts for the different ipods. I bought a nano w/ these speakers, and it fits fine.The strange thing is that every once in awhile when i put the ipod in, the speakers wouldn't play. I'd have to play with different combinations of whether the speakers and ipod are on and off when i put the ipod in, in order for the speakers to start working. I never seem to know the correct way to make the speakers play everytime. Fiddling gets very tiresome and I've been tempted to return it.Aside from that, i love these speakers."
4,A Good Value for the Size and Cost,"I bought this speaker dock for my desk at work, which it's perfect for. The sound is a little tinny in too large a room, or at too high a volume (which shouldn't be a surprise for it's size and price), but in the office, at the right volume, it gives full bodied sound that can't be beat. It's small enough too that you can bring it just about anywhere. It competes with the Bose dock as well, which costs more than twice as much."
2,"OK sound, but not worth the $","Here's what I like:1. It is pretty small and takes up very little space.Here's what I don't like:1. The sound is almost all treble...very 'tinny'...not what I would expect at this price point.2. The capacitive volume control buttons are annoying, they are supposed to work on the static electricity on your fingers, but they are very erratic. And when you want to adjust the volume, you want to adjust the volume. Why make this more complex than it needs to be?3. No remote control.I'm looking at returning this and getting that new Kensington speaker when it comes out."
1,SPEAKERS BLOW,"The speakers just blew again on my REPLACEMENT unit...I think JBL is flooding this website with positive responses because this product is too fragile to be used as ""portable"" speakers.I will return it again and try for something else. It's a shame...good size and sound during the few minutes it works (and I am not tough on my electronic equipment)."
3,Great Sound after getting a replacement,"Like the other reviewers before me, I too had problems with the volume button. Right out of the box, I could not change the volume. The speakers would go mute when I tried to adjust the volume. I contacted JBL and they said it was broken. Their published toll free number has been changed to a non-toll free number. That pissed me off. Kudos, however, to Amazon.com on how they handled it. They sent me directions on how to return it at no cost to me and sent me out a new speaker right away. So far,I have avoided putting my ipod onto the speakers when it is on and I have not had any problems. But as one of the other reviewers pointed out, it's not easy to see if the unit is powered up or not. The sound is terrific. I would not have expected such sound quality from small speakers, but I am fearful of having future problems with the volume buttons again. It is only for that reason that I give it 3 stars."
2,Stopped Working,"First one speaker stopped working, then the other did. Was just out of warranty, so JBL would do nothing for me. Damned expensive doorstop. Gave it two stars instead of one because the sound was pretty good when it worked. Steering clear of JBL products in the future."
5,Big sound small package,I was quite impressed with the volume of the Sound Stage. It sounds great also. Just remember that for the best sound you can adjust the equalizer on your iPod.Three of my friends now have a Sound Stage based solely on how impressed they were with listening to mine.It is great for taking on the road and listening to in Hotels rooms etc.
1,JBL -- Speakers BLOW (literally)!,"I am sad to say that I agree with those who have commented on the speakers blowing out. I should have known, given that the store where I listened to the JBL system had the same problem---but they blamed it on the prior customer. I bought the JBL less than a month ago, and have used it rarely, but when I put my ipod in it today, the speakers blew (even though it wasn't even loud) and the volume control doesn't work anymore. Upon further review today, I've found that many others have had the same problem. This is my FIRST review ever, because I've never been so disappointed to write a review before. I loved it for the first two weeks, but I expect $150 speakers to last longer than that."
2,Problems with Volume,"Let me begin by saying for the first week that my OnStage was working, it was great. Incredible sound for its size - crisp, clear and plenty of range. Not only does it look cool, it sounds better.However, and like some of the other reviews, I had a problem with the volume controls. After less than a week of use, my touch volume controls simply stopped functioning. I have read a number of other reviews (here and elsewhere) and this does not appear to be an isolated experience. I have also been working with Harmon to exchange for a new unit but this process has taken more than a month (and to date, I am still without a new unit).All in all, this will be a great product once the 'bugs' have been worked out. I do recommend (when working, the sound is impressive) but I recommend with caution."
5,The Holy Halo,This JBL ONSTAGE beats the AltecLansing INMOTION hands down! I went to the Apple store and compaired them side by side. The guy that has the AL is returning his for the JBL after I just showed him mine. Needs a remote control and volume indicator.
2,It works... Kinda...,"I used this system with my 1st generation iPod using the included cable and was very happy with the performance. I used it in this manner for several months. However, when I used it with my new 40 gb ipod I only got about 2 hours of use out of it before it stopped working. It appears that the connector inside the crade became loose. Long story short, I can no longer use it with the cradle, only with the auxillary cable. I was very disappointed when this happened as it was a $160 item when it was purchased. Hopefully, they've fixed this issue on later models."
1,BEWARE!!!! Can't roll back the hands of time...,"We did quite well with these speakers when our daughter had an iPod-Mini. When she got her ""new"" iPod for Xmas of '05, we ran into such bad luck with it (the iPod...) We kept taking it to the ""Genius Bar"" and they (God bless 'em!) ended up replacing the iPod 3 times. THEN - we found out that the round speakers actually ERASE THE HARD DRIVE of the current iPods!!!! If you have an older iPod, go for it. If you have a newer one - you are simply asking for trouble. I don't see these in the Apple Stores any more for a good reason ~"
1,HATE it!,There is nothing good to say about this speaker except the size. The sound quality sucks. It stops mid song on a regular basis. It is just a piece of crap. It is so crappy that I am throwing it away rather than give to someone.
1,I love this product,I love this product. It's got great sound and a great size. I feel it's as good as the Bose and for a much smaller price. It's easy to stick in my suitcase and fun to use.I only wish it had a remote control and could be battery operated for traveling.
1,Good Sound. Remote did not work...twice...i give up,bought it. remote didnt work. returned it for a new one. remote didnt work. Going back to find something other than JBL. good sound but need remote.
4,Very good sound from a small unit,"The sound is surprisingly good, if not quite hi fi, and the unit is small enough to throw in your luggage. You can use it to replace your tinny laptop speakers with the right cord. It doesn't work on batteries, though. My only real complain: you have to be a bit careful: the ipod can move on the connector, possibly damaging the dock and ipod."
2,"Sounds fine, but re-charger dock stopped working","I didn't have the chip problem, and I like the sound that goes with this little doughnut, but I have been troubled to discover that the re-charger dock no longer works while the iPod is docked. It conked out after a couple of months of use, so now I'm back to plugging the iPod into the computer or the wall socket in order to keep it charged. Perhaps this product wasn't ready for prime time."
3,Best sound quality for the price but...,"I visited a local electronics store and listened to several speaker systems for the ipod. After listening to altec lansing, jbl and several others, I found jbl to have the best sound quality. Clear trebble and decent bass reproduction. I have a 40 GB photo and while the packaging states that it is compatible with all ipods I had to pop out the small rubber pieces backing the dock station to make it fit - a tight fit, though. I will take heed from the other reveiwers and make sure I do not dock my ipod with both units on. I can live with the small inconvenience. I would give it 5 stars if not for the technical bug."
2,Very disappointing....no volume,"I bought this to replace my stereo speakers but was sorely disappointed. I sometimes like to listen to music loud...at least to hear it from room to room (i live in a small one bed), but this is not the speaker set for me. There is no volume in it.The upside...it looks great. And I didn't have any problems with it shorting out.I recommend that instead of spending $100 on this, readers head to Walgreens and pick up the cd walkman portable speakers for $10. Same quality sound/volume from what I heard."
2,Still defective,Great speaker if it works. Just bought one and they are still selling the units with the defective chip. Had to send it to JBL for a replacement.
4,"Works well, sounds good!","I'm very happy with my On Stage. I use it with my iPod (3rd generation, 20Gb) as a jukebox in my babies' nursery. The twins like listening to music, and it's fun to play for them. The On Stage works very well for the smaller room (9x12) and has a very decent, clear sound - bigger than I thought it would be, given the size of the unit. It's no substitute for the big stereo system downstairs, but it works well and it's really easy to use. I found that if you set it on a wooden dresser, the bass becomes a bit deeper and richer than if it's placed on a table.I haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers have had. Once I partially dislogded the iPod (when I was moving the On Stage around) and the sound went away, but I just pushed the iPod gently back in place, and everything was fine.The On Stage works perfectly for me. The only thing that annoys me is the *thump* when I turn off the unit power. But it's a minor nitpick."
3,"okay, a little confusing",this book has a good idea but it tends to drag on a bit. If you're interested in historical fiction you might like it.
4,roosevelt: the soldier of freedom,"Well written, most complete explanation of our entry into WW2 and the complicated relationships among Churchill, FDr, and Stalin. Almost reads like a novel."
1,Disapointment,I had high hopes for this book but found it to be very disappointing. They tell you about the various women who come into their clinic with various problems without really getting to how to help yourself. It felt like a long advertisement for themselves and their clinic. I didn't find it to be helpful at all and somewhat repetitive. I would not recommend this book.
2,Didn't help me,"My husband and I bought this book hoping it would address my problem (vaginismus). It was mentioned, but no helpful advice toward a solution was offered. There are a lot of women who suffer from this so it should be included in a ""revolutionary"" guide."
4,An intriguing story with a slightly silly finale,"A good story from the 14th season. The Doctor and Sarah land in an english quarry (!). A freak accident traps Sarah under loads of rock. When rescued, she is clinging to a stone hand which turns out to be the remnants of Eldrad - last of the Kastrians. 'Eldrad must live' is the coined phrase of this story and it pretty much sums everything up!Tom Baker and Liz Sladen work well together, with lots of good dialogue between the story. The story holds your attention, but the grand finale is pretty silly.Episode four marked the sad departure of Sarah-Jane Smith from Doctor Who. A scene which resulted in mixed responses from fans. Buy the video to watch it!This is a reasonable story and worth adding to your collection. If you're new to Doctor Who, then I'd suggest something like Horror of Fang Rock, or the Talons of Weng-Chiang to get you started."
2,You get what you pay for,I will keep this review simple.For the price this is an ok deal.However:The bag is a bit bulky and has no belt loop.The battery charger is finicky and has below average build qualityBatteries are generic rechargeables.You are better off finding a bag that fits your needs perfectly and picking up a separate charger/batteries. It will wind up costing you less in the long run.
3,"Good Camera Bag, Battery charger not well made.","The Fuifilim XLO5 kit comes with a fine camera bag. Its too soon to give the batteries a fair opinion, but I do know the charger is not of very good quality, the metal contacts that charge the battery bend very easily and have to be straightened at times if you not extremely gentle with it. Still not a bad buy for the money."
1,"Pls John, discover the time machine ...","I cant write a review of this book, since I started it but failed to finish it, I was completely uncaptivated and bored.Le Carre seems to have overlooked the fact that fictional literature had no bearing on reality, and therefore there was absolutely no need to acknowledge the departure of the cold war!Thus we could all enjoy what he is good at ... all of his recent novels (including and exemplified by this one) seem rather contrived and frankly uninteresting ... maybe he was bored with the cold war as a framework to write within, sadly since he earns his living writing, his interests have little to do with me the the consumer ... I wasted my money on this book ... but I will probably try once again to get through it ... just for the hell of it!"
3,A Must for Gardeners Everywhere,"I have been reading Le Carre for a number of years now and am amazed by this new novel -- talk about a green thumb! Sure the Cold War might be over, but love, LOVE, is eternal, and Le Carre knows a thing or two about the ins-and-outs (so to speak) of the new global economy. I can't recommend this slinky little thriller highly enough."
2,my review,"This book deals with an interesting topic: about the politics of big Pharmaceutical companies regarding their ""dumping"" medicines into the African market.The plot in itself tries to hold on and the characters are interesting, as well as the places we read about, but the ending is the one that confused me totally for it did not follow the concept of the book at all."
