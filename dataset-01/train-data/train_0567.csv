2,Southwest plate / lamp set,"The product looked very nice online, but it is certainly not of top quality. The lamp shade is not made of cloth, but with printed paper. It looks nice enough, but again, overall I was disappointed. I thought this was a unique lamp set, but it seems to be yet another mass manufactured cheap import."
3,A decent manual,"I bought this manual and the equivalent Clymer's manual for my 1980 GS850 before I realized that the official Suzuki workshop manual is available for free online. However, between the two printed books, I generally get the info I need and it's nice to have a printed reference when I'm in the garage. U.S. readers might be warned that this book was written in England and uses local verbiage (mudguard instead of fender, or spindle instead of axle, for example) but this doesn't pose an issue if you're well-traveled and can do the translation. Both metric and imperial units are used throughout."
5,Suzuki 850 motorcycle book,This is an excellent book for the novice or for a person just learningIt has very good instructions and clear pictures to see also
5,Another Appalachian classic,"We take classes at college to have our eyes opened and Julia Watts made my Appalachian lit class worth its tuition. Phases of the Moon is her ""serious piece of literature"" I guess as it seems to have won awards and stuff. It certainly deserves them. Glenda Mooney is a 50s rockabilly artist and a lesbian working class woman. She is forced to cope with the tenuousness of stardom when she has a child by the King of Rock, the pseudonymous Xagus Peavely (I love Watts's names, I might write a paper about them).As with all of Watts's books it features great humor (the funniest woman writing today?) and subtly drawn characterizations (though she kills her Little Richard character too soon). I wouldn't start here, but you'll want them all anyway."
3,Phases of the Moon,"I'm sorry to say, but I was very disappointed. I have a read and have all of Julie Watts's books in my library and was looking forward to reading ""Phases of the Moon"". I continued to read hoping that there would be some build up to a climax but it remained very stale. No build up and no climax not to her normal standards. Historically it may have been right on but not entertaining."
3,Konitz Escapes Kenton Confines,"During the time of this recording, Lee Konitz had been playing in the relatively regimented setting of Stan Kenton's big band. It is evident in some of his improvisational work here that he had been unable to ""stretch out"" for awhile. So while enjoyable, I would hate for this to be your only exposure to the marvelous alto of Lee Konitz. Gerry Mulligan and group are relaxed and proficient, while Lee seems rushed at times to show you all his ideas. If you are a Mulligan or Konitz fan, you'll probably want to have this anyway - it is a 3 star effort. But if you want just a sample of either artist, sample Lee's later work and check out Mulligan where he is not confined by playing host to Konitz."
4,indie fave,"I listened to the vinyl copy of this about 25 years ago and can't for the life of me recall how different the 2 songs are that one reviewer mentioned. But listening to this CD version I'm reminded of how good a band the Pale Fountains were, and how good this album was ... and still is. Very melodic indie rock with some punch. Ian Broudie's production touch perfectly complements the band's sound. In fact, the overall sound is not that far removed from his own band, the Lightning Seeds, and bands such as Wild Swans, Field Mice, etc. But as noted, the title cut has apparently been remixed for this CD version. Nevetheless, there are some real gems on this album, one that is still worth your listening pleasure."
1,poor quality,"I have purchased a beginner violin before and the quality wasn't bad. Maybe it's just this model or this particular violin - the pegs are plastic and the violin gets out of tune quickly. It comes with two bows, both of them are horrible, even compared with my other beginner violin.I have to return this violin. Amazon's return service is super!"
5,Great sound quality,"Very fast delivery, ""it's awsome"" says my child who I bought it for. The music teacher is pleased with it. We are very happy we listened to previous reviews and purchased this instrument. I would recomend to any other student/learner. Sound quality is an improvement from our starter 1/2 size violin."
1,Bad quality and unfit for use,"The specifications sounded perfect and the pictures looked great. The price point was right. And for a beginner student, it was cheaper than renting a violin from the stores recommended by the school. I fell for the trap. A big mistake. The violin arrived all wrapped up. My daughter was excited to open the package. I tried to set it up after looking at some videos on the Internet but it would not. The bridge would fall, the strings would not get the right tension. I sent it over to the teacher and I was told how useless this instrument was - the bridge, the strings, the bow, the tuning knobs, the overall shape of the body and alignment of the f's were all wrong and that it was simply unusable. I returned it the next day. Amazon was prompt with the pickup and credit back to my account. I eventually ended up renting from a local area store. Definitely a NO buy."
1,Think before you buy,The Cecilio 3/4 size violin is very poor quality and in not good for playing. I won't recommend anybody to purchase this violin.
4,A nice starter violin,"I bought this for my 9 year-old and have not been disappointed. I was worried that for the price the instrument might not hold up, but it has done well. The only negative comment I have is that the pegs move a little too easily and don't hold their pitch as well as I would like. I also bought her a nicer bow, which made a big difference in her sound. Overall, a fine beginner instrument."
3,Works You Out Once You Get the Hang of It...,"The work out is great, but they don't give very much direction. When I first played it, I didn't know what I was doing. It's fast paced, so it was hard to catch up. Once I got one thing, they moved to the next.Anyway, once you get the hang of it, it's great. I'm sore the next day and it gets my heart rate up."
5,Fun and fat burning,"This was a fun and fat burning video. They encourage you the entire time, make you feel good about yourself by the time it's done. Along with the fact that you can tell they are real women. They mess up and keep on going. They make the workout fun. But by the time your done you feel the burn. They say things like "" I'm so happy to be stretching and not doing squats. They were killing me."" They make little jokes through out the workout. They have a section that if you only have 5 mins to work out then do it. I highly enjoyed this boot camp. It made me feel good about myself. I recommend this product to other women no matter what shape or size, get up and get butt kicking awesome! They don't care if you never get super skinny, just healthy!"
4,"Fun, different - a great end-of-the-day stress reliever","Here's the thing - you should probably read through the books before working out with them. They have a distinct style of talking to their audiences and, from the look of some of the reviews here, some women weren't ready for it.I actually had a lot of fun with this work out. It's not as strenuous as my normal morning routine, but if you ever come home from work stressed out or annoyed or just plain angry, this is a fantastic stress relieving alternative to grabbing that bag of chips. There's a casual feel to it (the girls mess up the moves regularly) but I still broke a sweat. Anyone who puts their heart into it for 50 minutes is gonna get a workout. Don't let anyone tell you differently.It's a style that's probably not for everyone, but I'm a fan. Their books and philosophy has had me dropping weight for months and feeling like a brand new person. I love these bitches!"
5,I really liked this workout,"I read a lot of bad reviews for this workout, but I completely disagree. I am an intermediate exerciser- although this dvd will not cause you to work up a sweat, you will work your muscles and get your heart rate up. The moves are innovative and different. It moves quickly- I will admit the cueing sucks, but you will not be bored, because they switch up the moves frequently.They do a few repititions of a few moves - then move on to a different body part.This workout works you head to toe. I did it a few hours ago, and I am already feeling it. I would recommend checking this workout out and decide for yourself."
1,:(,Too much chit chat and not enough focus on exercise - sometimes you can't even see the movement for the face shots
1,Skip it!!,"This video is HORRIBLE!! First of all, you cannot go straight to the workouts without listening to them babble, and they continue to babble going from move to move without really explaining what they are doing. I am so disappointed. Not worth the aggravation. I would rather find some other way to burn off calories!!!"
1,"uninspiring, unmotivating, awful","I find it very hard to believe that these girls stay in shape by following their own videos. This is NOT a work out, and unless you get inspired by them spanking each other and telling each other how hot they are, save your money. This is a horrible excuse for an exercise video, so unless you plan on using this video as a coaster (the only purpose it will serve in your home), don't buy it."
1,hilarious,"I needed a quick workout... this definitely wasn't a workout but more of hilarious movements.This video is like if Tina Fey and Amy Poehler made a workout video for SNL. Hilarious.I didn't break a sweat nor did I feel any better after doing the workout. My feelings were more along the lines of ""I woke up early for this?!?!"""
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful","I have a very hard time getting into workout routines and this one makes it easy for me to start and stay with it. The comments that this routine is a breeze or too easy are false in my opinion. I have been doing them for two weeks now and I have lost 6 pounds already and I am always drenched in sweat and huffing by the time it's time to stretch. If you are a lighthearted and fun person, these DVDs are perfect for you! Rory and Kim are entertaining and a little bit out there. Sometimes it is a little hard to follow and they occasionally mess up but in my opinion it just makes it easier to relate to and love them! If you are a more ""hard core"" workout fanatic, this probably isn't the program for you, but if you are a regular everyday female that wants to lose weight without having to be so stuck up and serious, THIS IS THE WORKOUT FOR YOU!!!!"
5,high octane jazz at its best,"Own but only two CDs by this great jazz artist and will, no doubt, buy more.Have played this record, and Dippin', a few times by now--and each time I play either record it's like hearing it for the very first time--and that's the highest compliment I can give to any recording and/or musician.Further evidence that jazz (just might be) the greatest of the arts ever invented by humans. And that's a tough admission for me, as I have always been a lover of good writing and fine art."
1,"Great music, Warped Vinyl!",Great music (what I could play) but Vinyl Record was badly warped! Replacements by Amazon were all warped the same. Amazons fast replacements and ultimate refund are the only reason I will continue to purchase Vinyl from them.
1,Amateur dramatics,This is like sitting through an amateur production where they use the same jokes episode after episode - not edgy - not funny - very unclever.
3,"Good, but could've been better",This is a fun book. The excerpts from the film strips are accompanied by very interesting text about the subject.My big complaint is that I feel that whoever laid out this book was more interested in showing off their skills than in celebrating the film strips. The images & text from the strips are made small & a few frames dropped out of each strip even though they could easily have been included. While one or two frames are blown up to take up the majority of the page.
5,Another wonderful book from Danny Gregory!,"Danny Gregory has the gift of taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary. All his books, including this newest one, are delights."
2,Lileks wannabe,"This book reminded me very much of James Lileks' book, ""The Gallery of Regrettable Foods,"" which ironically picks apart 1950s cookbooks. The difference is that Lileks' accompanying commentary is absolutely hilarious. Danny Gregory writes well enough, and draws a few laughs, but mostly he just describes the filmstrips without adding any insight.The filmstrips themselves that are featured also aren't that interesting. I'm not old enough to remember any of them, but that shouldn't matter. Several years ago I read a book on the graphic auto-safety films that used to be shown to high schoolers. I didn't remember those films, either, but I still enjoyed it.The book itself is beautiful, and if you grew up in the 1950s and remember these filmstrips, this would make an excellent coffee-table book. Otherwise, I can't recommend it."
4,Good choice,I like these speakers because they are small and I can use them with my Zune at work. That's why I bought them and I am happy with the purchase. The batteries it came with seem to last ok - I've had them for 3 weeks and haven't died yet - I use them about 4-5 hours a day.
5,Surprisingly Excellent!,"This speaker system is excellent.- It will run off of your powered USB port if you obtain the proper cable.- The speakers provide clear crisp highs, very good mid-range and a decent bass response.- The sound will fill a small (9 x 12) room and provides great sound for listening or gaming at your computer, mp3 player, PDA, walkman, portable DVD player, etc.Highly recommended! The quality will surprise you. These are artfully designed and perform excellently (within their portable speaker class).Hint: The fabric carrying case does not have a 'hard side' to protect the exposed (no grill) speakers when you are transporting them. I snipped the rectangular form-fitted plastic container that the speakers ship in and placed the snipped portion (to cover the front only of the speakers) into the carry case. It fits perfectly and affords great added protection for the speakers when they are stored in the carrying case."
4,Satisfied Customer,The sound is impressive. I use it for my laptop and IPOD.I was disappointed that it didn't come with an adapter but I can always buy that myself. Excellent product for the price.I am very satisfied and happy with the speakers.
5,A Great Bargain,"I've used this little guy to provide computer sound (playing DVDs) for a whole classroom full of students, and it's come through with flying colors! Great sound.One thing: make sure you get an AC adaptor, since the AAA batteries run out really quickly..."
3,Portable Sound,"This little speaker system will fit the bill for travelling on the light side. It produces O.K. sound - don't expect the full volumed stereo experience. It doesn't fill up a room with sound, but you can play your mp3 player without the headphones and enjoy all the music on it. If you're at home, you might just want to hook up your mp3 player to your stereo system, if you have one. This one's good for travel."
5,I REALLY hope this comes out!,I LOVE this show! I've been waiting years to see the final season and have not given in to bootleg copies to see it!I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this set of 9 episodes is officially realeased!
3,X-Men Evolution Season by season box sets,I had it! Why can't the whole season box set be released? I believe that there are millions of fans out there who were having the same thought as I do. It really sucks to have the release of the episodes bit by bit...
4,Why not release all of the season in one package?,"I was holding of on buying any of theese indivedual DVD's with the hope of them releasing them all the together. Unfortunatlly they didn't and they probobly wont. This is the first X-men evolution DVD I bought and it has some of my favorite episodes. Including Retreat (Beast is thought to be bigfoot) and the season 2 finally. I only wish that they would come out with season three. Even if I have to buy them individually I would get them. I think that season three was where the series finally took off only to be shut down. Anyway; I think that these episodes are worth it by themselves, but only at ten buck, which is what I paid for them.I'm waiting for season three!!!!"
3,will there be a box set?,I agree season 2 needed to be in one set. for this reason i have not given it a 4 or 5.I have season 3 in one boxset its nicer than in multiples and there should be a season 4 out because when it was on tv I recorded it they had a few episodes with apokolips but i never got the final big battle. I don't think they showed the last one.Amazon can creat one if they wanted this is the only place I have found the season 1 boxset SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A SEASON 2 THE SAME WAY.
5,THE BEST X MEN DVD YET,"I just bought season 3 and it dosent evan have the last episodes, the last episodes are on season 4 I really hope they put season 4 on dvd because they have all the other episodes on dvd might as well put season 4 on dvd or season 3 is going to look bad"
3,Season release,"I totally agree with all the comments made about this series being released as one whole season set. I've loved the X-Men since I was a teenager, and I will continue to purchase these, but it is extremely frustrating to get them piece by piece.Does anyone know what the title is for Season 2 Volume 1? I can't seem to find it. If so I would appreciate it if someone could send it to me at ceejazz1@cox.net. Thank you."
1,Season 4 Will Probably Never Get To DVD,"We X-Men Evolution fans have been waiting years since the Season #3 release for any sort of news or release of Season #4, but alas... nothing. Word I heard was that there were some copyright disputes over Season 4 among several involved parties and it may be years before this DVD is released."
3,"Only one song, BUT.....","that one song: ""Some days were meant for rain"" is worth the cost of the cd. Tower of Power has always had a great lead singer, too bad they never seem to keep them and they don't sing their best R & B songs in concert; however, you must buy this cd for that great song."
3,this IS the 80's,"I admit this disc was disappointing at first. I huge leap from the TOP I was familiar with. But I tell you what...It sure grew on me. The tunes on Power are the epitome of the 80's. Several of the tracks sound like they could have come from the soundtrack of Lucas. Hey, it's a little cheesy. Don't crank it from your car with the windows down, but get past the cheesiness and enjoy it. There are still a lot of great horn arrangements here. And Rocco, on ""Count on Me""... giving those fingers a serious workout. Some nice guitar leads, also. Not that that's what TOP has traditionally been about, but... So buy it. Complete your collection. Give it a chance, especially if you spent any of your teen years in the 80's."
2,Buy It For Credit!,"I am a lifelong TOP fan. I own every TOP album. Have seen them live about 50 times. The lead singer here, Ellis Hall, was in my opinion, the best post-Lenny Williams frontman they ever had. However, except for the songs ""Credit"" and ""Count On Me"", the rest of this is dispensible. ""Credit"" alone, makes this worth having."
3,"One song, but worth it...","There is one song on this cd that is worth the price of the CD alone: ""Some days were meant for rain"" Tower of Power has always had a great lead singer, too bad they can never keep them and they don't sing their best R & B songs when in concert. Buy the cd for that song!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I am one of the biggest Tower fans, and so this album came as a bit of a disapointment to me. ""Credit"" is what your buying the album for, but as far as the rest, not what Tower of Power is all about. I own all albums, and if you haven't heard Tower before, I don't suggest buying this one. You can find ""Credit"" on the Double CD Anthology album. Which I highly suggest buying for the Full Tower effect."
2,When did Rick Springfield join TOP?,"Even bad TOP is still better than most of the stuff on the radio...but make no mistake, this is as bad as TOP gets. ""Count On Me"" ventures into ""Flashdance"" territory, but is at least listenable...and ""Personal Possession"" is a nice tune. As with ""Monster on a Leash"", however, the real problem is that it doesn't sound like TOP...it sounds like Rick Springfield or Cory Hart with the TOP Horns (and not the finest incarnation of the horns, without a strong tenor sax soloist)."
1,Avoid this Chance,"Peter Sellers was a precursor to Jim Carrey in many ways. He was uproariously funny in The Pink Panther series, he was understated in ""Lolita"", and masterful in ""Doctor Strangelove"". He was a crossover comic talent who could make the viewer laugh or cry, and whole range of emotions in between.Apparently, his personal life was a sad one. Although commercially successful, and very wealthy, he was often lonely, and suffered through many failed relationships.In short, his is the type of biography that should make fascinating reading.The author, however, fails badly in his treatment of Sellers. From overwhelming the reader by the sheer volume of facts and theories about his subject, to boring the reader by his suffocating style, to making incredulous assertions, such as when he speaks about interviewing Sellers from beyond the grave via a seance.Sadly, just keeping concentration intact is a chore.This is possibly the worst book I have ever read."
1,Lewis Goes too Far or Not Far Enough,"Mr. Lewis does fine research, but what he does with it is disturbing. He indeed interviewed scads of folks who knew the brilliant British comic actor. However, his book amounts to a scathing diatribe against the character of Peter Sellers. Buldging with subjective bias about the character and morality of Peter Sellers, the book ultimately condemns him as an evil man. From almost the first page, Lewis baldly states that Sellers was an evil person, incapable because of heredity and psychological reasons, of being good. In short, the book is the product of Mr. Lewis's private witch hunt. A more balanced and fair bio of the man is ""The Man Behind the Mask,"" by Peter Evans."
1,"My Eyes, My Eyes... my beautiful eyes...","This is exactly what you too will scream after struggling through just a couple of chapters of this weighty, yet most unsatisfying tome. Type set in a style banned in most civilized countries in the world, yet when forced to read to get your monies worth of your purchase, you will wonder when the good part starts. It's unlikely many care about years struggling in the trenches of the Goon Show when most sentient beings desire to know something about the man who made Dr. Strangelove or the Pink Panther movies. Forget it- it might get a passing mention but apparently the author is much for fascinated with what the young Peter Seller's parents had for lunch on a rainy afternoon. Two minutes in Wikipedia will enlighten you much more this effort!"
1,"A Flawed Man, But Not As Flawed As This Book","Peter Sellers was an amazing comic force, but also a flawed human being; often quite difficult to work with and given to bouts of childishness. Thus, one would not expect a biography of his life to paint a glowing portrait. However, nor should one have to wade through this rubbish, from an author who writes like he works for ""Hard Copy"" and who liberally fills in the blanks with his own imagination, drumming up entire conversations and thought processes. A lot of research went into this book, no doubt, but a lot of research was left out, as well. This is lazy and shoddy biographical writing, and it does an injustice to a gifted actor."
3,The Brilliant Madness of Peter Sellers,"""The Life and Death of Peter Sellers"" (1994) excels in its critical overview of the comic actor's film career, but fails as an objective biography. When author Roger Lewis delves into the personal aspects of Sellers' brilliant madness, he drowns in a sea of unpleasant negativity. Like many human beings, it's no surprise that Sellers was a mixed bag. Unfortunately, Lewis cannot break free from his ""evil monster"" thesis, which undermines the fascinating analysis of Sellers' screen portrayals. It's a shame the biographer didn't put his detailed research to better use."
5,Used to be a Writers Town & Always been a Fighters Town,"Algren breaks down Chicago in a real way. Written in 1951 the book was banned in Chicago originally, even though it's really a lovesong to the city. Algen celebrates the gamblers, grifters, sceneshifters, writers & fighters. The book was also an answer to Carl Sandburg's CHICAGO poem as well. The result is an 80 page prose poem in 7 chapters. This is a brilliant short book."
4,Exciting and romantic!,"The fourth pairing of Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy is pure magic. Kate is perfect as the southern belle who goes out west to marry a cattleman. Spencer Tracy is the cattleman whom Kate marries. From the start, Kate and Spencer don't see eye to eye on different issues, and an affair between Kate and Melvyn Douglas doesn't help the marriage. The cast is superb, even if parts of the movie seem to drag. Great ROMANTIC WESTERN/DRAMA!"
2,...Kazan's only Bomb..,"..Tracy's alcholism was a major problem on the set..He did'nt want to do the film but Hepburn (who carries the film, to no avail) cajoled him into making it.Kazan told everyone he knew to avoid seeing this disaster..Kazan got his wish.!..By the way this movies original running time according to Maltins movie guide is 131 minutes..Warner Bros..where's the missing 8..Hello..?..And how many times are they going to use Tom & Jerrys ""Cat Concerto"" (4-26-47) as a filler.?.A.Award or not it's a bore now.!"
5,"Very Different, Very Effective","I am somewhat biased because I know Julius, but I wouldn't know him if he wasn't a great teacher. He has a very unique approach that is completely different from the run-of-the-mill teacher and probably everyone else in the Top 100. As a golf professional, he was very instrumental in helping me take my game to the next level. I have seen him work with beginners and average players alike, and he gets results like no one else. His teaching approach is in this book, and anyone who gets it will benefit."
5,Meshach Browning: 44 Years of the life of a Hunter,A very compelling read about life in western Maryland on a hunter that helped settle the virgin lands in this area. Meshach rivals the likes of more well known hunters such as Boone & Crockett.
5,Great book,The Texas Tradition Series is worth reading. Elmer Kelton does a fine job in bringing the Texas west to life.
4,the tittle javelinas tmh and mrh,Iliked the story when the coyote got burned in the wood stove. I like the part when the girl was smarter than the guys why you may ask is that she build a adowe house.
5,Very cute....,"I picked this up for my three-year-old at a used book store while I was on business in Tucson. She has a ""Three Little Pigs book, so I thought this would be fun for her. I read it on the plane, and found it to be educational and funny, and the artwork is superb. When I got home, my daughter was just getting ready for bed, so we decided to read it. She just loved it! I look forward to reading it again. This book is also a great reminder of the desert Southwest."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The first Logan's Run sequel is definitely not as good as the original. After intervention by Ballard, Logan, etc., the Thinker supercomputer is no longer the force it once was. This means changes are happening.As Logan and Jessica tour around, lots of bad things happen to them, sex, violence, drugs, and combinations thereof."
5,This is a wonderful book for any child,"I read this book with my 9 year old son for a book report. It reminded me of my own childhood with the Michael Landon series ""Little House on the Prairie"". With very detailed descriptions of the hard and dangerous life as seen through the eyes of an eight year old girl, Laura. Really great."
4,A Rate on the prarie,"On The Banks of Plum Creek, by Laura Ingalls Wilder, a five out of five star rating, and memorable classis cheriched by readers for genorations along with the whole series.The adventures of Laura Ingalls and her family continue as they move from ""the little house on the prarie"" and travel to Minnessota in their covered wagon. There they move into a dug out beside the banks of Plum Creek. Soon Pa builds a little log house for his family after their first Christmas on their new land. Laura and her sister Mary go to school, fish in the creek and start a whole new life in their home. But mistortune sneaks upon the family when a terrible grasshopper plauge demolishes Pa's crop and he has to travel east on foot to find work. Join Laura and her pioneer family as they overcome their timeless struggles and their unforgetable triumphs."
4,depressing but good,"I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author. I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events, places, people, and time periods cannot be beat and it draws you right in."
3,Not Bad; not the best either = 3 1/4 stars,"Chantay Savage took Gaynor's disco hit and turned it into a slow jam. It's not bad but then again it's not too great either. Chantay Savage's vocals are great but the way she took Gaynor's disco hit and turned it into a slow jam just threw me off. Gloria Gaynor's song doesn't work as a slow jam. At least when Diana Ross covered it in 1995 for herTake Me Higheralbum, she remained true to it's disco origin. Anyways, if I wasn't introduced to Gaynor's version first And if Chantay Savage had made dance remixes, I probably would have enjoyed it better. It gets 3.25 stars for Chantay Savage's voice. The woman can sing."
5,Chantay Savage pulls all the strings,"A Diva of RnB ballads, Chantay strides through this album with consumate ease. There is no strain or stress in her her demerara-sweet voice, but only control, and the richest of tonal qualities. This is the album to share with a loved one - every track strains with a sensual delight. With an armful of producton staff, her voice holds the album together, invoking an onslaught of warmth and sensuousness from track 1 to track 15. Her musical upbringing shines through every number, gifting the listener with fabulously layered harmonies and vocal backdrops that perfectly complement her accomplished melodies. An absolute must for lovers of swing/r&b ballad, ably assisted by top drawer musicians and the almost complete guidance of Steve Hurley. Buy it, buy some champagne, light the fire, call your lover, and play it over and over again."
4,If her voice doesn't move you....,"Solid work, particularly the balladeerian version of I Will Survive which is anything, but a slavish cover of a disco hit."
4,"A Good, Not Great Debut.","Her remake of Gloria Gaynor's disco hit, into a soul gem is a stroke of genius and one of many highlights here. Tight production, great sound quality and a fair share of variety make this a good CD. ""Turned Away"", ""All Night, All Day"" and ""90 in The Red"" are my favorite cuts and they all sparkle with a mid to late 90's commercial soul sheen, but there is also a bit too much filler to make this a true soul classic. The title track makes this worth owning, THIS is what a remake should really be!"
3,A favorable advance...,"The single mix of You're Gone, it almost demonstrates the validity of Marillion with a trance deep rhythm, a very catching melody in the tradition of their more recent works (marillion.com and Anoraknophobia) and welcome flirtations with the style of U2 or Bryan Ferry. A favorable advance of their desired new album Marbles. The CD is completed with a live version of the splendid Faith (regrettably discarded of the official work) and the remix of When I Meet God, nothing new under the sun."
1,THE ILL-FORMED MUSINGS OF A BIGOT,"I honestly believe that either the previous reviewers are family members of mr. nevaer or they didn't read beyond the jacket flap copy.I did.mr. nevaer essentially attributes gap's challengesto gay people. I'm not kidding. with prose pearls such as ""flaming queens"" and ""twinkies"", he makes some of the most preposterous claims ever to be found in an allegedly serious business publication. not to mention usingsome of the most offensive language and thinking to be foundin anything published since 1957.the great majority of quotes from his anonymous sources ring incredibly false -- people don't talk like he writes -- and his theses are largely presented without support other than... um... that's what he thinks.mr. nevaer is, of course, free to hold whatever prejudiceshe likes. you, however, shouldn't pay to endorse them.and you can find much more serious and balanced considerationof the gap and its recent stumbles elsewhere."
2,Poor Presentation,"The plot was okay but it proved to be difficult reading on my Kindle. The worst problem was that the text display was very poor and no adjustment to the text settings could correct the problem. In addition, there were far too many grammatical and typographical errors; there should have been better proof reading and editing."
1,More Castrista Propaganda,"Just another ""evil America"" book. The breathless revelations are old news, and the basic premise stems from the same old Castro-versus-Goliath shtick that got old when thinking people finally woke up from the ""Sick-sties."" Had this been written from the opposite point of view - an inside look at the campaign of unbridled hate, disinformation and hysteria put out by Castro's propaganda machine (of which this may very well be a part) - THEN it might be an interesting piece of work."
5,"A rich, passionate novel about growing up in Hawaii.","Set in post WW II Hawaii, ""A Little Too Much is Enough"" chronicals the life experiences of a young Chinese-Hawaiian woman growing up in Honolulu from the perspectives of various members of her extended family. A very rich, colorful, highly ethnic portrayal of Hawaii's development into a major tourist location and that development's effects on the native population. Several core incidents and experiences are told, and re-told, through severl different voices and perspectives, yeilding a rich texture in which one comes to savor the totality of the experiene's effects on the entire Wong family. Delivered in a highly vernacular Hawaiian voice throughout, ""A Little Too Much is Enough"" in the end stands as not just a wonderful story, but also as a rich, multicultural experience"
5,Testify!,Religious music that smoulders and burns in the hands of Grant Green's tasteful lead lines and the rest of the players on this session. Blue Note knew what they were doing and Grant is probably the most underrated jazz guitarist from his era. He's right up there with Kenny Burrell and Wes Montgomery. And he put the blue in Blue Note. Religious music that works on a Saturday night as well as a Sunday morning!
4,Religion understood as a terrible bar of truth,"It appears in these selections that Russell was a very complex person who thought a great deal about religion. His views are not always consistent and they are pervaded by emotion. His general tendency is against religion. He especially hates Christianity as it has been practiced throughout history and the idea of Christian faith. He takes faith to be a set of related beliefs, on substantial issues, for which one has no good reasons. This selection is light reading, but it is too unfair to be used as an introduction to the philosophy of religion. Of course, this is one of the features of Russell's thought on religion that makes him psychologically interesting."
3,disappointed,"When I picked up Bertand Russell's ""THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY"" I was very impressed. It gave me a comprehensive overview of basic questions of philosphy that was very accessible for the beginner such as myself. But I must say that I thought ""BERTRAND RUSSELL ON GOD AND RELIGION"" was a disappointment. It almost seemed too simplistic and his tone was almost indignant at times. The best section of the book was the preface. Other than those twenty or so pages, the book seemed over-generalized and self-serving. More thoughful books for agnostics and atheists deserve your money."
2,Interesting but Hardly Relevant,Bertrand Russell's thoughts upon religion are often very interesting and exciting to read. I particularly enjoyed reading a theologian's nightmare. However hardly any of this book is philosophy on par with Russell's work in other subjects. Most of what appears to be valid in the book amounts to a critique of Christians. Very little of what Russell says is relevant to contemporary Christian philosophy in that his arguments are outdated. Very interesting but hardly any truth and substance against Christian thought.
2,Pretty dated,"Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for this overheated drama about a call girl wanting to go straight and find love. To me, the movie was terribly dated. The awful incidental music, complete at one point with a fully-orchestrated fugue in four parts, was intrusive and the dialogue was stilted. Taylor's acting was OK -- she was sexy in a kind of lush, overheated way. But the rest of the acting was so-so at best. Eddie Fisher demonstrated why this was one of only a couple of movies he appeared in and Laurence Harvey's hair was his most expressive feature."
2,"""Liz IS big. It's the picture that got small""","Elizabeth Taylor was one of the most beautiful women in the world back in 1960 and she's always been a very talented actress. As the promiscuous model that finally fell in love, Taylor was the best thing in the dated, overly melodramatic, often ridiculous movie that was adapted from the John O'Hara's novel (written in 1935). I did not read ""Butterfield 8"" but I can't believe that the author of ""Appointment in Samarra, and ""The Lockwood Concern"" wrote the stuff the cheap soap-operas are made of. Liz was big and she deserved her first Oscar but there are so many bad things about the movie - uninteresting characters, uninspired acting by the male protagonists, horrible irritating musical score - just a few of them. I read that Taylor hated the move when she was making it and she hates it now - I don't blame her. Taylor - Yes, the movie - no"
2,Just ok,This movie was not that great. It was just ok. If you like Elizabeth Taylor watch Cat on a hot tin roof not this drivel.
4,Butterfield 8 review,Elizabeth Taylor plays Gloria in one of her earlier films. Gloria tries to become respectable but it leads to tragedy when she dies in a car accident. Worth seeing.Also good performances by Laurence Harvey and Eddie Fisher
3,Heavy handed,"Butterfield 8 is one of those old-time movies written after the fashion of medieval morality plays. Liz Taylor is beautiful and the clothes are great, but it is rather unsubtle in its message."
3,Decent film with a few shortcomings,"Of course Elizabeth Taylor delivers a stellar performance in this film, one of the best in her career. The viewer feels that she IS Gloria, not merely portraying the part. However, I was sorely disappointed in the acting by Laurence Harvey. I found his performance to be sorely lacking, his emotions forced and faked, and his overall acting style stiff and unbelievable. Sounds harsh, I know, but I wish the producer/director had found a better actor to fill this role, and then the film would have been much better.On a final note, this is one of the best films I've ever seen about a prostitute. We can't mince words; that's exactly what Gloria is, although she tries to gloss it over. In addition, the final scene between Liggett and his wife is fairly decent, leaving the viewers to surmise the outcome of their marriage with their own imaginations, even though his wife is EXTREMELY underdeveloped and has a too-good-to-be-true attitude about the entire situation."
4,Liz Gives a Virtuoso Performance,"I, for one, believe that Elizabeth Taylor deserved an Oscar for her performance here, and I'm not alone. Yes, the movie is trashy, but it's also entertaining. Some of the dialogue is very enjoyable and smart (though some of it is stilted), and the movie was unusually frank for a film that was released in 1960. (It also gives you a feel for Manhattan at that time.) There is also some psychological depth in the way it depicts the difficulty someone may have in breaking away from their ""past.""And Elizabeth Taylor has never looked more sensual and alluring, and she brings genuine feeling to the character she plays. She's very convincing."
1,dont buy it,its not all that you think it is in my opinion I'd rather buy a 1 cent playstation game and play it instead
1,Not What I Expected,The necklace is very very small. The gold part of the necklace was thin and unsubstantial and the gems were practically microscopic. It cost over $100. This experience turned me off to buying jewelry without seeing it first.
3,now at least golfers can avoid medical school,"A very interesting little book that may provide ammunition for the die hard ""golf is a left handed game"" types, who might compare it to A New Way to Better Golf by Alex Morrison (1932) if they can find it. Personally, I believe the Bill Melhorn, Tommy Armour, Jimmy Ballard right sided method makes more sense for anyone who isn't tall, thin and super-flexible. The author recommends a three knuckle left handed grip and the photographs show a severely cupped left wrist at the top that is not easy to recover from. If you believe you can swing like Fred Couples this book may help. In any event, the anatomy lesson is first rate and the book for that reason alone is a worthy addition to any golf library."
4,Works like a dream,"We use this in our house to power a Japanese kotatsu heater -- and it works wonderfully! We haven't had any issues with the heater getting too hot, and we haven't yet tripped a fuse (we use this almost daily). It's simple to work and comes with an instruction sheet (telling how to operate and how to change the fuse), and with spare fuses."

4,Good old man new technic,Same old Sting like years ago but with 5.1 DTS sound. I think he knows his work. Realy good sound and realy good recorded.
1,Brand New Disappointment,"I must respectfully disagree with the other reviews of this CD. I was apalled by the poor choices engineer Elliott Scheiner made in doing the 5.1 mix. On most tracks Sting's voice is presented absolutely dry, with no reverb whatsoever. He sounds as if the band is in one room, and he is alone in another.Most disappointing was the way Scheiner somehow managed to take the dense, driving, locomotive whirlwind of sound in the stereo mix of ""Desert Rose"" and water it down to the point where it sounds like a Perry Como cover. My other favorite tune on the record, ""After the Rain Has Fallen"", is likewise rendered limp, gutless and unmoving. Half the instruments are submerged to the point of near inaudibility.Maybe I was expecting too much after the wonderfully enhanced listening experience I had with Steely Dan's ""Gaucho"" in DTS, but this CD is a huge letdown to me. I'll stick with the plain old two-channel version, thanks."
1,Low expectations were met.,"Really, there are no words to describe this. I wasn't expecting much from this movie and it delivered. I found most the characters obnoxious and annoying. Also, the picture is very misleading."
3,Drinking Game,Drinking and Game scenes have no merit or appeal. I expected to see extraordinary bar scenes over cable movies.None at all. Dull and not entertaining.
2,"2 stars for now, but maybe more!!!","I too just purchased a VEO Photo Traveler for a Dell Axim, and experienced the same problem as a previous review described. Because of the off-center positioning of the CF card slot and the slightly rounded top of the Axim, the card would not seat properly. I spoke with VEO tech support and they indicated that they had two separate versions of this product and had made a version specifically for Dell that I guess is only available on the Dell web site :(.I am working on getting an exchange with them right now, but from a product marketing standpoint, I would think that they need to improve their descriptions of which PPCs this will fit in.Tech Support for Veo is 408-474-0494."
4,works great with wm2003se,"worked great for the old os, nice if caould be made to work with 5 and 6 os"
2,Not one of my favorites,"Punch the Big Guy was recommended to me by several John Stewart fans. I was a bit disappointed, not because the album isn't good but because I felt it wasn't the John Stewart I know. The lyrics didn't have the same punch for me. I love his more folksy songs such as the ones that appear on Chilly Winds (my fave) or Wires From the Bunker. These songs definitely had a more 80s feel rather than that folksy reflective feel I like. If you are a fan of John's older stuff, I would recommend getting those albums first."
5,One of his best albums,"What a nice departure from his typical song groupings. Rosanne Cash adds her haunting vocals to this album. Chilly Winds has always been my favorite album but this one is right up there with it. John Stewart fans, don't miss this one"
5,Great CD,"This is an excellent cd. The first 6 songs, and the closing track are awesome songs. I agree with some of the reviews that say the last half of the cd is not as good as the first half, but the first 6 songs are just so much better than most of the garbage that's being released lately. Buy this album!"
3,Great potential on a first record,"The Fold's first record sure has some solid potential. The first four tracks are incredibly fast-paced and catchy; then the album slows right down, stalls a few times and barely runs through the finale, which gets a boost from guest vocalist Matt Thiessen of Relient K.The first half of the album had one producer, and the second half was produced by someone else in a different part of the country. The frontman for the band has even said in interviews that switching from one producer to another was a mistake. I cannot agree more.This album shows lots of potential; the lyrical content is solid and the musicians know how to put together some good rocking sounds. With a new record due out in May, I'm excited to see what these guys have to offer."
4,The Greatest Animal Story Ever Written.,"My mom bought me this book when I was ten I immediately thought it was going to be a good book as it had a charming front cover showing an innocent looking otter. Tarka is a sweet young otter and the book is like his life story in a way his life is like a human's . He is born ,he grows up,he loves he loses and he dies. The discription of him and his surroundings create a vivid picture in the readers mind. It really is a charming story and I would recommend this to anyone who loves animals and/or reading."
5,Great resource,"This is a great resource for those newly diagnosed, those with multiple food allergies, and severe food allergies. It contains practical tips for living with food allergies. It's not a cookbook, but does give help with creating your own recipes, where to find allergen-free foods. There's tips on traveling, eating out, fun non-food activies, and most of all support. The author gives examples from her own life, that are relevant to many of us with food allergies. This book is full of helps and tips to make life with food allergies easier."
1,North Pole,Ir will not play on any CD player we have nor on the DVD player.It was a waste of money and I am angry because it was a gift.
1,Do not use my review for the AUDIO TAPE!,"Amazon? Earth to Amazon? Come in please. My review was for a book with a bad introduction, not for an audio tape of the actual classic sans negative introduction. Oh, well.This is BOOK REVIEW: Cooper Square anti-Peary introduced version. This classic has been spoiled by another ""bully pulpit"" 28-page anti-Peary introduction. As a public domain work it may be facsimile reproduced by anyone. ANYONE. And so it has.The work is a classic in exploration history, but the ""new"" introduction is from an anti-Peary crusader. Thumbs down!"
4,"Not Your ""Usual"" Dolphy","THis is not your usual Dolphy (the ""usual Dolphy"" is an oxymoron, anyway). These unusual takes were taped in New York, and given to a friend of Dolphy's before he left for his stint with Charles Mingus in 1964, dying just months later.Left un-named, and boxed up while other Dolphy music surfaced, these takes offer an exploratory and introverted look at Dolphy toward the end of his life.This is not comparable to ""Out To Lunch,"" or any other Dolphy albums. It is much more sparse, and if you can believe it, more far out.Strange vocal arrangement appear on a couple of tracks, as well as a wicked flute solo.If you are a hard core Dolphite, you will dig.Four stars."
2,dolphy disappointment,"Suprisingly enough this cd was a disappointment.Despite high energy playing from Dolphy the vocal arrangements On ""Jim Crow"" and ""Improvisations and Tukras"" are tedious and at times almost unbearable. The other 3 tracks feature two that are flute solos and ""Dolphy N"" the best track that features Dolphy on alto and Ron Carter on bass. Overall the album is inconsistent and doesn't hold up next to Dolphy classics such as ""Out To Lunch"". Avoid."
3,Katharine Hepburn in a Joan Fontaine role???,"The first thing that came to my mind as I was watching this movie was ""How in the world did Katharine Hepburn get this role?"" She did a great job, as usual, but this was definitely a Joan Fontaine role. Joan Fontaine shines in this type of movie. Katharine Hepburn just fits so much better in her roles as a strong, independent woman, than a scared (supposedly) and timid young woman.Katharine Hepburn plays Ann Sheridan, the smart daughter of a scientist (this part actually reminded me of some of her other roles), who falls in love with Robert Taylor. The two of them get married, and she realizes he is not the man she thought he was. He has an extreme hatred for his brother (Robert Mitchum), whom she has never met. Surprising climax."
3,B film noir not up to the classics of the 40s,"Length:: 4:53 MinsThis is an OK B film, but if you like film noir, the classics from this same period are better. I suggest* Rebecca 1940 - young woman marries rich widower who is haunted by the memory of his 1st wife.* Secret Behind the Door 1947 Michael Redgrave worries Joan Bennett* Shadow of a Doubt 1943 - Joseph Cotten is a serial wife killer* Sorry Wrong Number 1948 Barbara Stanwyck overhears a plot to kill her by her husband Burt Lancaster* The Two Mrs. Carrols 1947 Bogart attempts to kill Barbara Stanwyck* Sudden Fear 1952 Jack Palance plots to kill Joan Crawford* Dial M For Murder 1954 Ray Milland plots to kill Grace Kelley* Gaslight 1944 Charles Boyer tries to drive wife Ingrid Bergman mad"
3,US Presidents Interactive,"I am pleased with the information given on the game. However, I ama little disappointed that there is not a volume control. I also donot like how cheaply the game is put together."
5,Teach your child about Presidential trivia,"This was a replacement of the toy we have had for several years. My son used it so much he wore it out. He is blind and these type of toys are an easy and fast way to learn information sometimes not taught in our schools. He has memorized every question on this toy, which makes him look very smart. We have everyone of these types of toy we can find: Solar system, Underwater, Dinasours, United States, Continents the Human body. I wish they would make more of these, like The Periodic Table of elements. These can teach him in a way that school cannot. Well worth the money."
2,"Interesting cases, but way out of the norm","I guess it's fascinating stuff to a lawyer (which is what the author is), but most of these cases are so off the wall and bizarre they are irrelvant to us plebes."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,The device works very well. Only drawback is the thick attached cap makes it hard to fit in some USB ports
3,Cable Tuner did not work.,"When I got this, the cable tuner did not work. Coby just said to send it back. But instead I just got a digital cable box and the Video inputs work fine. Nice picture and good speakers, but didn't work with its internal tuner.Also, Comcast remotes will not work with this TV."
1,This is HORRIBLE,"Im a huge fan of WW2 flight sims and the Pacific versions are among my favorites. CFS1 was an awesome game and I bought the add on with great expectations. I was severly disappointed. Playing it with more than the sys requirements, the game was choppy and the graphics were poor. It ""looks cheap"". There is little detail to the terrain or planes compared to CFS.Even after upgrading to a blazing fast system and maxing out all the setting this game is still a disappointment. I have seen other abacus add ons to CFS since buying this one and they are all the same in terms of quality and playability. I wont buy another one."
2,"We are in the Pacific now, not Europe.",I loved the new planes. The missions are flakey. Many missions don't give you enough fuel to successfully complete the objective. What's with the Japanese medals? They are the same as the German medals. Pretty disappointing. I don't recommend this as an add on to the World War II Europe series.
3,"Clever, Funny and Easy Going.","While in a production of Hamlet, playing among others, Fortinbras, I recalled hearing of this play. As well cast mates and I debated about a play ala Rosencranz and Guildenstern Are Dead, that comes from Hamlet, and takes on questions about those remaining alive. Well, here is Fortinbras.Opening as Hamlet ends, Fortinbras arrives into a kingdom-for-free and takes on what Hamlet showed to be a rotten state in Denmark. Very much humor ensues, as Horatio and Osric, the only survivors who witnessed the end of the royal family, attempt to adaprt to this new careless ruler.This is a great read. Quick, funny, clever and easy going. If someone wanted to be very bold, a production of this tied into Hamlet would be an amazing ride."
4,Felco review,Excellent product and good price for such quality blades! Buying a quality pruner and then just having to replace the blades every 5 yrs is such a good investment!
5,Sharp Stuff,"Great set of hand pruners. Good feel in the hand. With the 8"" lenght they cut easily through three quarter inch hardwood limbs, leaving a clean cut. I've been gardening for over 40 years and have used a lot of pruners and these are the best yet."
4,Thanks,"Product was smaller than expected, but served its purpose. Some pieces were chipped, but I made do."
1,Painful for my checkbook,"From the synopsis, I would have assumed that the book would follow with cohesive theories answering those questions. Rather, Murphy's book is filled with gross assumptions, butchered imagery and disconnected ideas. Murphy treats the audience as if they didn't know anything about the `evils' of technology. The imagery he uses is overdramatic and ill fitting. He often digresses into topics, which seem totally irrelevant without any introduction or explanation. Sometimes I forgot what the book was about while reading it. The theories and ideas that Murphy proposes are enough to make most sane people outraged. This book was painful to read, and painful for my checkbook."
1,Where is the 0 star option?,"This book doesn't even deserve one star; since there was no option for one star, I figured it at least deserves one star for the author being brave enough to publish it. This book is the biggest joke to literature. The author didn't even bother to look up his information under an acurate source, considering one of his most abundent sources is altavista.com (not realizing that it is a search engine). This book just rambles on and on about pointless theories and so called 'conspiricies.' I'm still not sure if this book was written as a joke, or if John sat in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere and had a few hours open to write countless pages on his typewriter."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"I'd have to say that this is possibly the worst attepmt to write a knowledgable, precise book on the Columbine massacre. This book has no real focus, no real meaning, and to be honest, no real point. Murphy's style is an atrocity. It is a completely wretched read, and I don't think that I would pay someone to read this book. Murphy jumps all over the place, and never really stays on one track, he seems to have a wandering mind...especially when he wrote this. I don't think that I will ever read another book by Murphy.-scott skillings"
2,History Class Lecture,"Reading this book, I expected to learn more about the family lives of Harris and Klebold. I was hoping to better understand their personal lives and personal fears. Instead, I got a confusing mass of content with no transitions. I felt that it was overkill of everything that has happened in the past. I undersatnd that some of the references connect with the Columbine Massacre, but could not find the smooth transitions needed to connect the topics. I felt the book emphasized that teens are plyable and stupid. I felt it bashed the internet and the media. I did however, appreciate the thouroughness of how it is easy for anyone to have a gun. Also, it was nice to read how Murphy doesn't think it's too late for America. It just seems that he doesn't think of the past how it really was. There were also many typos. I guess I just wasn't expecting what I got."
1,A waste of trees,"This book was a pile of biast, unresearched dribble. Murphy rambles on for pages about unrelated topics and does not even attempt to connect them to the massacre at Columbine. Instead of rushing to be the first out with a novel on Columbine he should have researched his topic and really focused on his subject. Oh, and he should have bought a dictionary!"
1,What's the Point?,"I feel that this book is very poorly written. This book totally lost my interest. I just couldn't get into it because every bit of it was facts, restated over and over again. I don't at all mind that his book was based on facts, I just didn't think his presentation was very effective. Overall I feel this book was written very poorly because the subject matter wasn't given very much thought. One may even assume that it was written ona rush, in order to capitalize."
1,"It's Keanu REEVES, not REAVES!","This is the one thing that PLAGUED me while reading this book. Oooh... the characters in the Matrix wore trenchcoats and Harris & Klebold loved the Matrix, so that's why they wore trenchcoats! Guess what, so do Hassidic Jews! So do people when it's raining! And it's not Samuel L. Jackson in the Matrix, it's Laurence Fishburne... you'd think Murphy would get at least that information right with all the facts he cited from the wondrous internet he recently discovered."
1,Day of Reckoning,"Titanic, Star Trek, Dungeons and Dragons, She's All That, Varsity Blues, The Matrix...no, I'm not listing off my movie collection, these all seem to have led to the shootings at Columbine! There is one obvious link in the content of these movies...what? You don't see it? If you do, you will enjoy this marvelous piece of literature, full of random pieces of information disguised as facts, as well as a plethora of grammatical errors. If you are insanely compelled to buy this book, I will sell you mine."
1,NO FOCUS,"I THOUGHT THAT MURPHY'S BOOK WAS TERRIBLY PUT TOGETHER. IN SO MANY PLACES HE GOT OFF THE SUBJECT AND WOULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ERIC AND DYLAN. HE WOULD START ONE PLACE AND BY THE TIME BY THE TIME HE FINISHED ""MAKING HIS POINT"" YOU HAD FORGOTTEN WHY HE EVEN WENT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. HIS INFORMATION WAS UNFACTUAL AND THE TONE OF THE BOOK WAS THAT MURPHY THOUGHT HE JUST KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE INTERNET AS IF HE HAD DISCOVERED IT. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO KNOW THE REAL TRUTH ABOUT THE COLUMBINE MASSACRE."
1,Review,"I thought that John Murphy is terrably confused in this book that he has written. Very often he goes off into space with these random ideas that do not even correlate with the main subject at hand. It is as if he brought ten books into one. He makes many statments in the book, but does not back them up at all with any statistics. Also, his sources that he does use are very questionable. Overall, I didn't like the book at all, and thought it needed a lot more editing then was done."
1,Better Luck Next Time,"I personally would not recommend this book to anyone. I find it to be very appalling that someone would actually consent to the printing of this piece of... literature? Mr. Murphy obviously wrote this book just to say he is a published author. One would think from the title that you would actually learn something about that fateful day at Columbine. However, one soon comes to find that this is definitely not the case. All you will read about is Mr. Murphy's take on the Internet, neo-nazism, the media, and his vast knowledge of military history. I wish you all the luck on your next book, Mr. Murphy."
1,Definitely not a page-turner!,"Why would someone or anyone want to pay [money] for a book that makes absolutely no sense and is filled with both spelling and grammatical errors? In his book, Day of Reckoning: The Massacre at Columbine High School author, John Murphy wastes page after page with his senseless drivel about what he thought had really gone through the minds of Dylan and Kliebold.The only page turning was done was to see what else he could make up. Blaming anything and anyone he can think of blaming for what occurred. In addition, often researching whom he is blaming very poorly. In most cases, it appears that the web was searched and the first hit that came up was solid enough to be put it the book.For a book that is very biased and very unorganized it is a shock to see that such a book was published; considering it should never have been published.I recommend that one does not buy this book but rather find something better to do with their money."
1,This book is a watse of time and money,"This book was not thought out very well. The author rambles on about idea after idea and never connects them in a logical way. I think he had seen an opportunity to get some quick money and receive some recognition so he went for it. The book ended up being HIS Day of Reckoning! Didn't he know that those ""gain popularity overnight"" and ""get rich quick"" schemes only work in the movies?"
1,This book is a waste of time,"This book was not very well thought out. There are numerous typos and he jumps around from one idea to the next without really connecting them in a logical way. I think he seen an opportunity to make some quick money and receive recognition and he went for it. Didn't he know that those ""get rich quick"" schemes only work in the movies!!"
1,Did He have an editor?,"Is this book really about Colombine? Or is this Murphy's opinion on life? He is supposed to tell the story of Dylan and Eric and explain the facts of what happened in April 1999 at Colombine High School. He talks about everything except what happens that day. He talks the Nazis,SWAT team tactics, and the movie ""Matrix"" really well, but as far as Colombine, we know the same information we knew about the situation before we read Murphy...."
2,wreck of the day.,"If one were to harvest every bad seed that fell from every evil that has befallen our race in it's twentieth century,one would apparently arrive at the root cause of the Columbine high massacre.Simplistic and jejune as this may seem, Mr. Murphy has succeeded in packing this volume with dazzlingly shocking tidbits that create a strand of events that only conclude in the very real possibility that a conspiracy cooked up by Hitler, M-TV and the creators of our modern technology is why these confused and amoral boys were led to do the things they did. If this sort of sweeping delirium appeals to your senses then rush right out to get your very own copy.You won't be disappointed.It,s just such a sad comment however, that an event of such obvious social proportions has not yet been written.It may never be.It's patently old news by now to most,and that's the real point isn't it?"
1,Samuel L Jackson was excellent in the Matrix!!,"If I were to say that this book was worthy of purchasing or even taking the time to read, I would be a liar. Along with the internet, Mr. Murphy must have never heard of ""spell checks"" or ""proofreading before publishing to avoid horrible mistakes."" Mistakes that were the most obvious were the spelling errors, the grammar confusions, and the inconsequential rambling about slightly related but primarily mind numbing details. Yet this book still managed to have one redeeming lesson to be learned. You don't have to be a good writer to have a book published."
2,awful,The author needed to invest in an editor. He makes some good points but due to the poor grammar and writing style it's hard to keep your attention. Had he stuck to one thing it like a wand developed riter is supposed to then the book might have been good. Due to his single causality however we don't see what really ent on in columbine. He should have used more personal interviews i think what would've kept the interest of the reader.
2,The Day of Reckoning,"The author needed to invest in an editor. Throughout the book he begins making a point, but then goese of onto something different. This left me wanting more. I think he should have used more personal interviews maybe even traveled to the school, but he didn't. He uses single casuality throughout much of the book. Had he stuck to one point and went along with it the book might have been good, but there're to many random points within it to keep my attention. I thought this book was awful."
2,Bewildered,"Reading this book left me with many questions. First, what was the author trying to convey to the reader? Second, was the authors intent to confuse the reader by jumping from one point to another with no link to the previous point?In the end, I certainly would not recommend this book and my expections were clearly not met. Also, some good editing would have been helpful."
1,Where is the editor?,"I can give Murphy credit for some of the points he makes in his book. But, this book has a lot of great ideas with no form and no conclusion to any of the ideas that are started. Besides Murphy's jumping around from idea to idea, he has so many gramatical and structural mistakes that it was a distraction from the reading."
1,A Book About Nothing,"The title of this book does not fit the content. Murphy discusses many issues and people in this book that does not have any connection to what you would think the book is about. Also, Murphy should have had an editor look over this book before it was published because he makes a lot of grammatical errors that a fifth grader can spot. He basically tried to take advantage of a national tradegy to make his pockets a little fatter."
2,Come on already!,"It is great that someone wishes to write about the Columbine Massacre, but is this really what Murphy is writing about? Internet great he seems excited for the new technolgy and also claims that is full of violence and not good. Beyond being all over the board on the topic and jumping from excuse to excuse at times you can see what Murphy is saying. Overall I was not very impressed with the writing style or how Murphy discussed such a touchy subject."
1,What a Waste of Time!,"Wow, all I can say about this book is that it was very amusing. I have never in my life read a book that contained so many grammatical errors. I felt that this book was a waste of paper. Everything that Murphy said was completely irrelevant to the topic of Columbine. The book could have easily been condensed into a much shorter piece. The majority of the statements made by Murphy did not make sense at all. Overall, I felt that the book was a waste of my time and a waste of Murphy's as well."
1,Just Terrible!!!,"This book was just terrible. It is beyond me to understand how something this terrible was even published. With sooo many grammatical errors and irrelevant points, this book was hard to comprehend. Is there a such thing as ZERO stars????"
5,comfy shoes,"i love these shoes, they are so comfertable. and are easy to clean. I plan to buy another pair in another color!"
4,a good read,The death of WcW.The company that should have never died. But did. This book explors in detail just how the company with a billion dollar backer died. It's amazing how the WWF(WWE now) has learnt not a thing from the down fall of WCW. HHH is the new Kevin Nash.
3,Review - The Death of WCW,"As an interesting book as this was, I expected something a bit mroe wittier coming from the pen on R. D. Reynolds. Although it did have some really great information on exactly hom WCW came to its end, I don't think we all needed the knowledge that a house show on the 6th of March 2000, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina drew 2,236 paying fans. It's the continuing references to facts and figures like that almost on EVERY page of the book that drops it down a few ""snowflake"" points in my review."
5,Very Entertaining ...,"With a book such as this, you're going to have people questioning the legitimacy of the facts that are presented. Many will say that they're ""one sided"" and ""don't tell the whole story"", in my opinion R.D. Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez do their absolute best to give the most detailed second hand account that they can possibly muster.If you're a long time wrestling fan, and most likely you are if you're considering this book, then a good majority of the information that is presented here is not new to you ... however it's presented in such a way where you are entertained when re-reading it. There are also enough new tidbits to keep your appetite wettened for more.I read this book in one day, and normally I don't do that, I usually make it a point to break my books up over a few days. However, this is an extremely entertaining read, and beyond that it also provides a good majority of information that many may not have been aware of prior.I cannot recommend this book enough."
4,You'll be dying to get this!,"WCW was a organization that had a share of it's good times and bad times. ""The Death of WCW"" covers all that. It tells the story of a regional prmotion in the 80's, to becoming a powerhouse in the 90's, to becoming a non-watcher by the new millenium. It tracks the highs & lows of an organization that outlasted the WWE. I guarantee you, you want to read a classic!"
4,The Death of WCW,"If you were/still are a big fan of everything pro wrestling, this book is for you. I'm an avid fan of wrestling and this book does a good job telling the story of WCW beginning to grueling end. This book takes a sarcastic approach along with alot of humorous stories about some of wrestling's colorful characters. All in all, not a bad waste of five bucks[minus shipping]. A definite good read, but, it wasn't exactly intellectually challenging[which I guess makes a good mid-ground dynamic]. If you're not really a fan of wrestling, you probably won't like this then[but, then again, why would you be reading the review??!!]."
2,very disappointed,"These shoes look good online, but they do not have the support I expect from Rockport. Wish I could return them, but keep trying to wear them with my Orthotics. MY shoe of choice will continue to be Easy Spirit. kc"
4,Imagine a girl singing hardcore...,"OK, so if you haven't heard of Daisy Chainsaw, you're missing out. It may also mean you haven't heard of Queen Adreena, which would be a grave travesty. Daisy Chainsaw are the earlier incarnation of Queen Adreena, and while Queen Adreena encompasses the more melodic aspects of DC, the sheer vitality of Daisy Chainsaw is not to be sniffed at. With interesting yet beautiful vocals layered over a punk/rock/metal/eclectic musical background, lyrics that will leave you scratching your head, and maybe other parts as well, I highly recommend this album to anyone, especially fans of female fronted punk."
3,Everything IS Weird.,"To most people, this would just sound like a bunch of noise, annoying, and possibly made with a chainsaw. But if you're not one of those people, you should love it. In truth, this band sounds like they learned their instruments right before recording, like the ""Sex Pistols"" at their worst, but they still pull it off. The better tracks are ""I Feel Insane"", ""Hope Your Dreams Come True"", and the really good ""Love Your Money"". It's also nice to hear a woman sing (or hysterically scream), over this kind of music. This is out of print now, but I would have recommended getting it used anyway."
1,Bad Form,"I would like to repeat something said by that great philosopher Frederick of Honolulu. He said ""Repeating silly quotes is the highest form of bad form."" Only a liberal nut-job would consider ""dissent....the highest form of patriotism"", not reasoned and rational dissent, just mere dissent. Using that sort of messed-up logic would make all the enemies of my country (the USA), patriots, since they certainly are dissenting. It is a silly saying. Dissent from anyone that so highly regards this absurd and ridiculous motto."
3,Interesting in parts...low reviewers miss the point,"Skip through the vulgarity and focus on the business details, which are interesting.A lot of reviewers gave a low rating, because they feel the authors complained too much about their high paying jobs. The idea of these reviewers seems to be 'of course you have to work hard and sacrifice to make a lot of money'. This misses the point, the authors of this book describe how i-banking associates and analysts (slaves), work hard and sacrifice in an almost totally non-productive way. It's make work that they do instead of real work, and it doesn't actually contribute any of the profit that makes up their 200k compensation. It's just some mindless ritual that ruins their personal lives."
3,funny book but not real,"This is a funny book, but as an employee of an investment banking firm I can attest that it is very marginally based in reality."
4,Banking in a Nutshell,"Monkey Business is definitely a true depiction of the world of investment banking and Wall Street. As a Wharton graduate, I've been exposed to this world, and can attest to the idiosyncracies, stupidities, and ridiculous nature of the world of investment banking. As a participant in the madness, the book poked fun at the very things I experienced and continue to endure.The book is an easy read, and it will probably take no more than a couple of sittings to finish it. It's better to read before you enter the investment banking world, because then you can see how accurate the book really is. Once you've already been there, the book can get a bit boring because it rehashes what you already know. It's still a definitely fun and amusing book."
5,Killer book.,"This book was a killer. It spares no mercy when it takes the investment banking profession to task. What the authors say is true, and they say it in a way that keeps you laughing all the way to your online brokerage account. Let's hope Rolfe and Troob take on a few other professions. Suggestion: how about law?"
1,Wretched writing,"A virtual dictionary of hackneyed phrases and cliche's ... several of them misspelled, incidentally. As for the obscenity, only MBA's could make it this unfunny and tiresome. Beyond the startling insight that 100 hours a week spent copying and collating proposals will spoil your social life, there are no significant insights into the world of investment banking here. Disillusioned with the shallow and mercenary world of DLJ, these young Horaces flee to the bucolic pleasures of hedge fund management. Only their callow assuredness is startling."
3,HUMOR WITH EXAGGERATIONS,"this book is entertaining if you are bored, or want to read some lampooning of the IB industry. some insights to the workings of IB industry which could be useful."
3,Stick to the Facts - Forget the Metaphors,"Monkey Business is an incredibly valuable tool for anyone considering a job in Investment Banking. Rolfe and Troob don't hold back when it comes to telling of the ills (and monetary rewards) of the investment banking business. For that reason alone, Monkey Business is an insightful resource, in my opinion. However, I could have done without the endless misogynistic metaphors that seemed to prove that Rolfe and Troob are no better than the one-tracked minded investment bankers they write about. Perhaps the authors were simply trying to write down to their expected audience; I can only hope that I'm not one of them!"
2,Monkeys,"This book tries unsucessfully to imitate ""Liar's Poker"". The authors exhibit an astounding amount of prejudice and tastelessness. More importantly, there is little self-reflection on their part. If what they write is true (which, for an outsider, is hard to believe), ""Monkey Business"" raises more questions about the authors' character and intelligence than about investment banking in general or DLJ in particular."
3,A fun read but overall not substantive,A fun look into the world of investment banking. It won't make a great impact on your life but is definitely worth checking out from the library.
5,Funny and truthful,"Gives rather cynical, but realistic and funny inside view to the actual work in the great corporate finance houses."
3,funny but unrealistic,"I know from experience that this book is not terribly realistic. it was funny, though"
3,Reinforced my low opinion of Wall Street,"Ok, its not great literature, but it is amusing and sheds valuable light on what is really going on behind the scenes in this economy. I didnt think it was as gross as some reviewers described, though that may just be me. Overall, it reinforced my low opinion of Wall Street investment bankers as superfluous parasites who do nothing productive and spend all their time thinking of clever ways to destroy productive companies so they can get even more obscenely rich. Their fascination with expensive clothes is so revealing of an unconscious awareness that their occupation is so disgustingly filthy and amoral."
1,Former Investment Bankers make Bad Writers,"I am an analyst at a top-3 Investment Bank in the financial analyst training program. I feel that this book was terribly written, both in grammar and content. The authors, Troob and Rolfe, try to paint an ""oasis"" picture of Wall St. banking from the 80's only to be hit with the realities of the 90's. A child might enjoy this book, but anyone with some knowledge of Wall St. and especially banking, should steer clear of this disappointing failure. Stick to finance guys...you're definitely not writers!"
4,account of I-banking associate's life,"I give it only 4 stars because the book is mostly making fun of the negative side of what they experienced, instead of a complete objective review. I did not work in I-banking or on Wall Street, but from their writing, I believe the authors' accounts were true and sincere. They were accurate accounts of what they did, saw and what they were thinking. The writing is hilarious."
1,"Big, Big Disappointment","As a recent Wharton grad and New York-based financier, I was hoping to find MONKEY BUSINESS insightful and entertaining. This was not the case! While the authors accurately capture the shenanigans of Wall Street banks, their disturbing chauvinism and extreme cynicism make this book almost unreadable. Where were the editors of this book???The authors make themselves out to be models of enlightment, but in reality, they show absolutely no signs of personal growth. On Wall Street, they took the money and ran --- simply running to another Wall Street job.My advice: Skip this one and re-read LIAR'S POKER."
2,How-to-become a Snake Oil Salesman,"Investment Bankers are glorified Snake Oil salesmen; hopefully, this has become more apparant since the tech debacle of 2000. As for the book, its not much better. Some of the stories are slightly humorous, but there is no real point, theme, or lesson to be learned. Furthermore, many of the anecdotal stories are greatly over-exaggerated (trust me, I've been there). On the positive side, it is a quick read, but what would you expect from two simple-minded IB associates."
1,Wait for the Paperback,"This book, while slightly entertaining, was so horribly written. If you're interested in banking, it's a good anecdotal book on life as a banker. I hope that the reading audience realizes that almost every aspect of the book was exaggerated. We bankers aren't that crass - the 1980s are over! Furthermore, Troob and Rolfe are not of Michael Lewis' caliber - I agree with the other reviewer - guys, don't quit your day jobs!"
2,The boy who refused million dollar salary,"It is a story of coming of age in the banking industry. To spoil the story, his first year salary is 200,000 $, he collects the money and bonus and so on, then quits. For love."
2,Off the Mark,I think that this book was really off the mark. I am a junior banker at a top-3 firm and these guys didn't hit the nail on the head. I think that the reviews thus far were completely processed by friends of the authors..even the grammar in the book is bad. It is a joke that this is where literature is today...if that's what you can call it!
4,"funny read, but too extreme",true and funny. but a bit too extreme.i was laughing my butttt off while reading.
2,It's been sitting on my shelf for over 3 years....,"When I got it, I read the first chapter, got bored and when on to another book. It's been sitting on my shelf ever since, I think that says enough. Want a good read about investment banking? Read F.I.A.S.C.O by Frank Partnoy - even better than Liar's Poker."
4,Monkeying Around the Street,"""See the happy moron, He doesn't give a damn. I wish I were a moron- My God, perhaps I am!"" And thus starts the chapter on recruiting....The rate at which copies of this book have been ripped off shelves (not to mention the number of reviews on this site) show that there is clearly something to Monkey Business. Anyone who has been involved with Wall Street in any way will - at the very least - find this amusing. Those who are still living the analyst/associate life may find it slightly depressing. And those who are out will be able to look back and laugh. Though much of Monkey Business is exaggerated, it is definitely a worthwhile way to pass the time. So, pick up the book, flip through the life and times of today's junior investment banker, and smirk yourself to sleep."
2,Wait for the Paperback,"The book, itself, was rather entertaining but horribly written. Troob and Rolfe did get the basics of investment banking down - although I am sure they took dramatic license and exaggerated their associate experiences. For those people who are new to the industry, the book will give you some insight into the profession and explain the basics of what ""drafting"" means, or what is a pitch book... However, as far as the quality of writing, Rolfe and Troob need some help. Guys, don't quit your day job!"
5,"A little rough around the edges, but pretty darn good.","These guys are not Shakespeare, but then again they were investment bankers so what do you expect? Despite some rough patches, this is an incredibly funny book that moves you through the roller coaster ride as a junior investment banker. Far from being bitter, the authors had the foresight to realize early in the game what they were getting themselves into and change paths before it became too late. Hats off to their honesty.I've read a lot of so-called ""Wall Street"" books, and until Monkey Business hadn't found one that didn't spend 90% of its time with the author slapping themselves on the back. We've finally gotten some honesty, and as you'll see the results ain't pretty. Now we can all understand why most of the authors to date have spent so much time filling us full of BS.God save the Queen! God bless Monkey Business!"
5,"Fast, furious, hilarious read","I happened to stumble on these guys website StreetMonkey.com and found what they wrote funny. So, I bought the book and loved it. It is hilarious and I laughed out loud many times. Rolfe and Troob should be comedians. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to laugh until their stomach hurts."
5,Hillarious!!!,This book made me laugh out loud several times. It is very entertaining but sometimes gets graphically vulgar so it should be rated R++. A great guys book and an eadsy read. I looked forward to my treat each evening of getting to the next pages.
4,Fantastic book..4 stars only because Liar's Poker is better,"Much of what I wrote about Liar's Poker applies to Monkey business as well. This book is, in a word, great. Breakneck pace, hilarious caricatures of high powered moneymen, and at the same time very human. Highly recommended for anyone interested in knowing about life on the Street. And it is very accurate; a good companion to Liar's Poker. They detail two different periods in time, and though they have aspects in common, the books are certainly different, and worth reading separately. Yes, Liar's Poker is better..being longer, it has more space to tell its tales. That does not stop Monkey Business from being a true page-turner in its own right."
4,Demystifying Investment Banking,"This is a bio of two guys who made it into the magical world of investment banking and felt conned. It is an excellent reality check for anyone who fantasizes about being an investment banker (and really, who does anymore?). One of the secrets of investment banks is that they get great labor at dirt cheap prices. A lot of ivy leaguers and pedigreed MBAs are probably wondering why they sold their youth at such low prices. If you are thinking about trying to get into corporate finance at an investment bank, read this book. If you want to learn about how investment banks work, keep looking."
2,Very vulgar - almost tossed it early,"But I didn't. What does that say about me? Still, I was highly offended at all the unnecessary vulgarity.That said, the book was quite readable, and interesting. Still, it was thrown together. Could have been much more informative. Not that great for someone really wanting to know how things work in the investment banking realm.For the life of me though, I simply cannot imagine how one of those authors could tell the world he did what he did ""in public view."" It's one thing to do something so shameful. It's another thing to tell everybody about it."
1,I couldn't finish it.,"Wow. Such blatant mysogeny is surprising in the 21st century. I was getting annoyed by it, and then the language suddenly turned extremely vulgar and borderline homophobic, too. Unapologetic descriptions of company sponsored visits to strip clubs and sexual harassment are what made me eventually decide it was not worth any more of my time."
5,Life @ DLJ,"Fantastic book! Once you pick it up you are unable to put it down. A very accurate depiction of life as a Investment Banker. As a former DLJ Associate, I assure you this book is the real deal."
4,Entertaining,"A little too raunchy sometimes but overall entertaining and extremely informative on the heirarchy of investment bankers and what their jobs are like. Very easy to read, funny at times and chronological but i didnt like how the only way for you to tell if the ""other"" author was narrating was to notice the change in font. There should be a label of some sort.Pretty good book."
2,easy to read but short of content,"It's not the kind of book that bores the reader but I gave it 2 stars only because it's just excessively cynical. What I mean is that the author sees the worst in everything and everybody and yet they have chosen this career after they had previously had the chance to work in investment banking. Why could that be if the this was all about money, status and showing off? Why? Not hard to guess."
3,Where's The Plot?,"While Monkey Business contains some funny anecdotes, two thingsbecome quickly aparent when you read this book. The first is thatTroob and Rolfe are a couple of clowns. I have little sympathy for abanker who complains that he doesn't get any sleep, but spends a few nights a week at Shenanagans until 4am. However, they should be commended for not masking their initial naivite in the industry as it makes some of their actions understandable.The second (and most important) is that the story reads like a pitch book of complaints - section by section with no conflict or compelling reason to keep you reading. The book is enjoyable in chunks, but it could have been so much better in more capable hands..... Monkey Business will leave you wanting more than it can give."
2,Another DLJer...,"Pretty entertaining, but the book has no real plot or story flow. Additionally, most bankers I know don't have the authors' sophomoric, frat-inspired sense of humor and view of non-blue blooders, and can write at a level more sophisticated than a high school senior's."
4,Solid but biased,"I defintley think that all aspiring bankers should give this a read. It gives you a good idea of what they will be doing. However, the book is very bias and you should not let it influence you in your decision. You have to work very hard to make it in this world and these guys just realized that banking was not for them. They gave it a shot and I wouldnt call them quitters, they just did what they had to do. The book is funny and a good read; but dont read too much into it."
3,might leave you with an attitude that's too cynical,"I will only add this to all that's been said so far - the one line that made most impression on me, was when Troob said about Rolfe when he first met him (s.th. like) 'he did not know anything, but he wanted to learn and did not have an attitude'. if you lack these qualities, you'll soon be made to feel sorry that you ever accepted a job offer from 'the best and the brightest'.so, quite useful advice right there. ironically, by cursing left and right, the authors leave the reader with a supercynical attitude, undoing one of the few real pieces of wisdom that the book has to offer. i'm not defending the big guns, just trying to say that you can only hurt yourself if you allow the Dark Side 'to dominate your destiny'. read Sun Tsu instead.."
5,Better than a Swedish massage,"My husband, who is an investment banker, bought me this book. He told me that if I read it, I might get a better understanding of why he comes home so angry some nights. He was right. Monkey Business sat on my bedstand for a full two months before I finally picked it up and read it. Once I did, I couldn't put it down! It was funny and enlightening. Now all I have to do is convince my husband to quit his job ..."
2,"A Junk Food Read, For More Nutrition try Liar's Poker","This book has already been written. Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker is wittier, more intelligent, and gives you more juicy inside information. And he names names, unlike this whining, nervous duo who still earn their keep in the money biz.The three interesting bits in Monkey Business were: 1) Sitting in on the pitch. 2) How the prospectus is developed. 3) The joke that is due diligence.These account for ten percent of the book. The other ninety percent meanders about in artless writing, unnecessarily crude language, and endless iterations of the menial paper shuffling that mighty MBA's must stoop to while earning $200K.Not worth your while. I'm sorry I gave it mine."
2,3 Words (and this is from a DLJ-er)...,"Not very compelling. Actually, I haven't finished reading it, and I got it several weeks ago. So far, I've found that parts of the book read like a layman's guide to the basics of investment banking rather than a nitty-gritty exposé of this proverbial boys' club. Perhaps I should finish those last couple of chapters...maybe some time when I'm really bored..."
3,"Very funny, but definitely exaggerated","Having been an analyst at an investment bank, I faced a few situations that were very similar to the ones mentioned in the book. However, as I read it, it was clear that the authors were trying to exaggerate the pain and suffereing involved in the business. With that aside, it is a very funny account of i-banking life."
4,Funny book,This is an extremely funny book. But the language can be vulgar at times. I liked the book because it kinda proved to me that a job after an MBA is not a bed of roses with a lot money pouring in.I think it is a must read for any MBA aspirant
5,Hilarious & Entertaining Insider's View,"The authors not only talk the talk but walk the walk. They've been there and done that... to say the least. As a relatively inexperienced MBA whirling about the world of finance and producing endless Excel spreadsheets, I find this to be the most honest picture as to what awaits an I-banker whether they do their stint in Manhattan or here abouts in Chicago. If you want a true to life picture without any of the glitz and propaganda that so often accompanies this little understood industry then this most definitely is a ""must read""."
5,A great read!,"A fabulous book! Really funny, down to earth and a genuine depiction of life as an I-banker analyst! I applaud the authors for their candid stories and great quips. I have recommended it to all of my colleagues and friends! Truly entertaining."
5,New and familiar training with the bullet proof Non-Aggresion Principle,"I grew up around firearms enthusiasts and I believe this DVD presented many things that are not always articulated in modern conventional training. Some of the new aspects I find to be helpful that are covered include: garment clearing, full explanation of a useful 4 step draw position, dominant sighting, practical methods on how to handle firearm (Semi-auto pistol/revolver/semi-auto rifle) malfunctions and tactical definitions such as cover vs. concealment. Overall, this easy to watch and informative DVD will refresh some long held common safety firearm handling practices while also bringing to light new perspectives of gun ownership. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the film covers all the above mentioned topics while strictly adhering to the unbreakable Non-Aggression Principle. Worms."
4,"A Beautiful Quilt, but some inaccuracies in the description","I ordered this quilt and the shams. They are truly beautiful and I am quite happy with them as my summer bedcovers! The piecing is well-done and the embroidery is subtle and enhances the design.People ordering this product however should be aware of the following:1) The quilt is made in China (if this matters to you)2) The quilt is almost certainly not 100% cotton. There are two tags attached. One (the care label) says ""100% cotton"", the other says ""all new material consisting of 100% polyester"". My impression based on look and feel is that the fabric cover itself is all or mostly cotton, but the filling may well be polyester.I wish I had known these things before ordering, but I probably would have made the same choice."
4,Good Overview of Modern South African Politics,"This is a good introduction to post-apartheid South African politics. Deegan reviews the implosion of apartheid in the 1980s and early 1990s, and then analyzes the national elections of 1994 and 1999. The book is crammed with tables on everything from voter attitudes to crime rates. The writing is pedestrian and repetitive but also clear and jargon-free -- something of an accomplishment for a book written by a political scientist. My only real complaint is the unbalanced choice of topics. For example, Deegan devotes pages and pages to gender issues and to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; however, she has nothing on HIV/AIDS, foreign policy, or the internal workings of the ANC. For a book on politics, there is also a weird lack of political biography, with the exception of sections on Nelson Mandela."
1,waste of time/ misleading,"I have never written a review before on any produst that I brought on amazon. But this video was so much garbage that I fely obligated to say something. First I love the history channel and therefore expected a lot from their video. However all it talked about was american cars and the evolution af indy cars and Nascar. There are rally cars, touring cars, endurance racing all different types of racing all over the world. In fact racing probably did'nt even start first in the USA. I learned nothing new nor could I interest my young nephew in it. I also got the motorcycle video and it was just as bad. Advice to History channel.......there is another world out there!!!!!"
3,"not a 2 star yawn like vol.1,(yea, that was me)","Vol.2 is ALOT better and more helpful than its predecesser.the emotions are varied and there are no more clich'e characters too,they are in fact, believable.The drawings are nice and you wont find typos or any engrish,nor will you find bits of info paired with tons of pics.You wont find much trouble applying the examples's emotions to your own original creations.I couldnt give this book 4 stars though because I just couldnt get into it for some reason,maybe cuz i'm still trying to get rid of that bad after-taste that was volume one(yea,i was the one person who didnt like vol.1).This is one of those books you have to read to really judge....."
3,Just can't put my finger on it,"Maybe it's the fact that some of the expressions were pretty obvious, or maybe that there weren't enough types characters in this book, maybe it's that there really was no lady with pink hair wearing a furry yellow dress like on the cover. All I know is that this book was not COMPLETELY helpful. Overall it was good, but, I don't know, maybe I'm just picky. I would reccomend this book to people interested in anime, who know how to draw a basic body. I would NOT reccomend this book to complete beginners, you have to know at least a little bit about the basic body structure. OKAY, maybe a little more than just the basic body structure, but you get the idea. It's a good book to just have around for references and ideas, not much else."
4,Confirms what I discovered as a 1st grade teacher.,"At the end of the first day of school in my second year as a first grade teacher, a little girl came up to me at the end of the day. She said, ""But, Teacher, we can't go home yet. I haven't learn how to read."" So the next day, I came prepared with predictable books and activities that would allow every child go home on that second day with a sense that he/she could read.Mark Thogmartin presents the same philosophy in his book. This book made me think about how I could tie phonics instruction in more closely with predictable books. I came away from this book with concrete ideas and plans that will help children understand connections in reading, phonics, writing, and enjoying stories."
4,Offers a balanced approach.,"I enjoyed this book very much and thought it offered a good balance, using phonics and real books. I used it with my daughter, and it has been another useful component in her learning how to read. It is also very inexpensive compared to all those packaged programs available! Recommended books are listed at the back of the book. I'd heartily recommend this title."
4,A Top Ten Dick's Pick,"It's a shame this is out of print, because it's one of the better Dick's Picks. It's worth tracking down just for the mammoth jams on ""That's It For the Other One"" and ""Turn On Your Lovelight"" on disc 2, but it also contains some less typical numbers like ""Dire Wolf,"" ""High Time,"" and ""Mason's Children."" And, of course, there is the nearly 30-minute ""Dark Star,"" which goes totally off the rails into psychedelia in the second half. Great stuff, worth finding at a record & tape exchange or via trade."
4,Good Show(s),"I enjoy this. It has a nice ""hot"" sound courtesy of Owsley who spent some time and energy trying to figure out how best to capture the band's sound onto tape - kudos to him.Performance-wise, I've heard better. Specifically, ""Live-Dead"" and even moreso ""Dick's Picks 16"" which I think is the most stunning, truly stunning Dead performance I've heard."
5,This Is It,"This is it...Spend the rent money, spend the grocery money. You may end up homeless and starving, but this is it!! You may have to endure hardships until your dying day, but you will die in the Dead Zone. Get it? ...now get it!"
1,Philosophy of Consciousness without an Object,"I ordered the book, paid for it and was told it was in the mail. That was over a month ago. I have written and todate have not received a response. I'd love to read the book and comment on it's content."
3,Not the Usual Peters/Michaels,"I love MPM. I've read and reread her books hundreds of times. This book, and one other (Black Rainbow) I have never reread. The depressing endings just jarred me! I'm used to being uplifted. And while I know I'm a bit lame about it, I prefer my fiction to be uplifting and/or funny. Get enough of the downside of things in non fiction/real life.Shed a few tears of disappointment at the end of this. So unusual for me with MPM's books. She is my all time favorite."
3,A Bit of a Let Down,"I love most of the novels by Barbara Michaels and was surprised when I found a novel I had not yet read. ""Someone in the House"" started out a novel of wit, humor, and mystery but the ending felt rushed and anticlimatic. As a fan of Barbara Michaels I'm glad I read the novel, though I would not recommend it to anyone who was not a die hard fan."
5,Smooth and articulate,"This early classic from Earl Klugh is one of my favorite ""smooth jazz"" albums. Every track contains memorable melodies. The recording is very crisp."
1,"I want like him, but...","I've tried to listen to Kurt Elling for a couple of years now and am aware that he is being touted as ""the next best thing in male jazz vocalists"" but I have to say once you get past the 'slickness', there's not much. His voice is often flat and in my mind he's borderline tone-deaf, not to mention those incessant monotone scat ramblings. I want to like this guy just based on the material he tackles, but so far I cannot warm up to him. I will keep listening though."
2,Cheesy...,"Kurt Elling has a decent voice, but doesn't write meaningful lyrics. His writing involves copying the style of beat poets to a much lower standard, and placing words above fast solo passages to which he can barely pronounce the syllables. It ends up sounding entirely ridiculous. The musicians on the album sound great, even if they're playing on some obnoxiously smooth arrangments, yet Elling hardly improvises in his phrasing, giving the tunes a hokey, and uninspired sound. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a modern jazz vocal album that is very good. I recommend the classics for this genre."
2,Drive was wrong color and did not work.,I purchased a black faced Mitsumi floppy disk drive and what I got was a white faced floppy drive that didn't even work.I would stay away from purchasing this product.

5,Excellent!,"I purchased this guitar for my daughter who is learning guitar an it was a great buy. The item arrived as described. The seller was also very helpful, shipped quick an very professional."
3,"Ok, but not flawless","I bought this violin as an upgrade to my beginner's violin.It has a great sound and looks very pleasing. However, i did run into some problems. The A string's fine tuner broke making it impossible to change the string, so the violin is sort of useless now. The pegs and bow and other accesories were all good, no complaints.Overall this violin is a good buy but probably cheaply made.Regards"
1,Chinese violins,"These cheap Chinese made violins look OK opening the box, but they're strictly beginner's material. My daughters needed to upgrade after 1 year, and the supposedly higher-grade models are absolutely no better.The other reviews I read here look suspicious -- seller or manufacturer padding??Take your chances on one of these if you want, but read the return policy VERY carefully."
1,Don't even think about it.,"Do not buy this violin, you are not getting anything for your money. This violin (or at least the one they sent me) is better used as a nice wall piece. The nut is too low so the strings sit right on the mishaped fingerboard. Not to mention that the nut is also un-even. The pegs are too short and do not fit the peg box correctly. One bow was strung to tight which warped the wood making it difficult to play with and the other bow's skrew is stipped which makes it a hit or miss if you can even tighten it. The fine tuners hardley do there job and the strings come out of toon very easily. When tuned playing the strings open sound good, but try playing other note... it probably is not going to happen. This may just be a case of me getting a jacked up violin, but there is no reason that this 'unplayable violin' should have made it past inspection."
1,Garbage,"This is without a doubt the worst violin I have ever had the displeasure of playing. The violin looks nothing like the way it did in the pictures, the strings sounded annoying, of the fine tuners three were broken, the violin feels like plastic, the craftwork was mediocre. One day I took off the strings to replace them and the fingerboard fell off! And if it can't get any worse, the piece holding the tail piece popped off and it was hell putting it back in. When I replaced the strings with some quality fourty dollar strings, the violin still sounded like garbage! Don't be so quick to buy a violin, save your money and buy from some better brands. Remember, you get what you pay for..."
1,Regret this purchase,"I live in a condo. When I first started playing I would use the mute. First time I played without the mute, ""OUCH""! Sounds like your playing a tin can. Replaced the strings with expensive ones, still sounds like crap. Best advice don't buy over the net."
5,Such a cool lamp,This lamp is beautiful and interesting. We love it. Everyone who sees it wants it. It arrived at our house quickly and was very easy to set-up.
5,Beautiful lamp,"If you want to be able to see into the future, travel through wormholes and enjoy a relaxing night in front of a captivating lamp, get this thing. If not, continue with your normal boring life."
4,What next?,"I'm enjoying my drives refreshing my memory of the french I learned years ago, but see no instruction as to what the next step in the process with Pimsleur? Is it a primer for the 232$ French 1? Any suggestions?"
2,Not a fan of Pimsleur,"Learning a language from the end of the word to the beginning is really weird. It was a bit intense for listening to and repeating in the car. Maybe if I'd been at home, it would have helped."
3,Average,"Don't let the intro fool you, this tool needs a lot more in order to understand and speak french"
3,There are good and bad ...,"there are definitely strength and weaknesses about these CDs. first of all, it does not come with any written material. If you can't see how a word is spell, how can you memorize it efficiently? The syllabus is very restricted. There are you and I, but how about he, she and they? The strength is that they repeat themselves over and over again, so by the end, you've heard it enough times that it does start to stick. They do emphasize on the correct pronunciation, which is very helpful. I'd give it a 3 star at best."
5,Utterly fabulously wonderfully superb!!!!!,"A marvellously-written, moving story about a young teenager named Gaby and her trials and turmoils over her widowed mother's upcoming marriage to someone who appears at first to be intolerable to Gaby, but who eventually turns out to be the family's salvation and becomes as kind and loving as anyone could ask for in a stepfather. I thought the author really excelled in writing a book that both teaches and entertains --- we could all learn a lesson from this book. Everyone should read this book."
1,Still Looking,Same 3 episodes as are on the DVD Rifleman. I love to watch different episodes of Rifleman not the same 3 all the time.
2,Wrong dvd or eps was sent to me.,"i did not receive the eps listed on the internet for vol 1. . I reordered the dvd vol 1, olny to recvd the wrong dvd again."
3,Amazon's review is incorrect,"Although the DVD was delivered fast and it does play the way it should, it is not the DVD that is reviewed by Amazon. The Amazon review indicates it's the first 4 epeisodes which are the ""Sharpsooter"", ""Home Range"", ""The Marshall"", and ""the Pet"". These episodes are not the ones on the DVD. It was three different ones. These are the same three that are included on all the Rifleman DVD/VHS that I have found. I was excited to think I was buying a DVD with the 1st 4 episodes on it."
2,MISLEADING PRODUCT,"THE description trlls of the first five episodes in detail enen Sam Peckenpah directing ,But those are not the episoseds we get instead we get three lesser episodes THE RIFLEMAN was one of the best shows on tv with half hor of good vrs evil lessons in morilaty every week i was dissapointed that the first five episodes the talked about weren't on the disc"
2,Poor quality,"First of all, there were only three episodes on this DVD. The quality of the recording leaves a lot to be desired as well. I'm just glad it was so inexpensive!"
3,Only three shows,"I loved the Rifleman growing up, like a surrogate father figure. So I liked having some of the shows to remember simpler times. It would have been nice to have a few more of the shows for the price, and don't know who selected the three, they are okay but none that I remembered. Plus the transfer is grainy and lined. Other than that, it is a nice set."
5,Good experience,Ordered this DVD for Christmas.It is only a few episodes and it arrived in time to be wrapped and given on Christmas.
2,Not satified,I thought this was the series but one was one programIt was ok but would have liked the series.
2,"Not a review of this item, but a comment","I wish there was a DVD collection for The Rifleman - The Entire Series. I'm not looking for volumes like these that only have 3 episodes on them. This is a classic show and deserves the treatment that other classic shows of the era have received, such I Love Lucy, Gunsmoke - The First Season and The Andy Griffith Show."
4,Just fabulous!,Watching the Rifleman brought back some wonderful memories. Each story very well written along with the acting was superb. Great entertainment.
2,FAIR,"i gave this book a fair rating because i wanted to learn more about native americans, wounded knee, and lost bird. what i read was more about womens sufferage, the personal life of the colby's, and very little about lost bird. really only the last two chapters went into any detail about lost bird."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this DVD primarily for the Halliween Vignette. I was having a Halliween party. You can imagine my dismay when I discovered that all the other holiday vignettes played flawlessly, but the Halloween one has a glitch and stops and starts snd sometimes freezes. It wouldn't play at all on my computer or my ordinary DVD player, but on my Blu-ray player it played, but eith the glitches snd freezes."
2,Toy delivered not like the image displayed on Amazon,"There were no dimension shown on the listing. So the trailer was smaller than anticipated. In addition, the trailer displayed on Amazon has the John Deere logo and the two back lights. Neither where shipped. For the price paid you would expect everything as displayed."
2,Cant believe I paid so much for this,"seriously feel stupid. w/ shipping this cost over 90 dollars. Half the time my son (just 4yrs old) tries to haul something, it falls out the back. HE is disappointed and keeps asking me to fix it.Direction are terrible ( but not as bad as tractor directions) and they didn't even label the stickers right.Overall probably wouldn't have bought tractor or trailer."
5,These are excellent vitamins,My doctor suggested I take these Damage Control Vitamins to give me more energy. I was a bit stunned to discover I needed to take 12 of these pills a day. But I did it and I must they I did get my energy back and feel much better. I found I don't need to take the whole dose every day. I was concerned that taking so many pills would give me a stomach ache. But that is not the case at all. My stomach feels fine. If you are a little low on energy I recommend these vitamins.
5,Convenient and potent,Great especially because I travel. No need to count. Vitamins are great and I can see and feel a difference after taking them for a few weeks.
2,Not My Favorite,"I love almost everything written by Georgette Heyer. And this book is one of the reasons why I say ""almost""...This book is more of a Gothic-style romance, but even considering that, I found it a creepy and unpleasant read. And if you are looking for a romance novel, there is very little focus on the romance and more on the weird goings-on of possibly deranged family members.I would steer clear of this one! She has so many other great novels, don't waste your time here.I'd give it a one-star, but I just can't do that to a Heyer novel."
2,Not Heyer's genre -- and it shows,"Cousin Kate was one of Georgette Heyer's attempts to write a Gothic novel, and,unfortunately, she pretty much failed. Not being a Regency romance, it lacks the sparkle, wit, whimsy and comic which were her trademarks in that genre that she ruled. But in Cousin Kate Heyer demonstrated that she was unable to write a story of moody suspense, and so it fails as a Gothic. So what is it then? Just a dull, flat story. The characters lacked interest, especially and including the two main characters, Kate and Phillip, who were one-dimensional and boring. There was no suspense to speak of and the events at the end, which could have and should have been quite dramatic, instead fell flat.Unfortunately I can't recommend this book. I don't know the titles of the other supposed Gothics that Heyer wrote, but if I find out I will avoid them."
3,A book with a skilful blend of romance & mystery,"Georgette Heyer is one of my favourite authors & though this book is given only 3 stars her style of writing is unbeatable. This book feautures a pretty, but penniless heroine spirited away to a life of luxury by her kind aunt or so she thinks. The plot is skilfully woven & it is impossible to guess or be prepared for the ending. This book is not written like her other romance novels featuring a dashing hero admist balls, exclusive clubs etc but set in the countryside. Though at first it might be a little dragging, the plot thickens gradually & it's impossible to put it down. An unforgattable read!! I only wish I could say more, but that would spoil the whole effect of the story. I'm sure this book willl leave a deep impression on emotional hearts, as it did on mine."
1,Pass on this one.,"I've just started reading Georgette Heyer and of the 8 books I have read, I've loved them all until I got to this one. The heroine is annoying and because I could not sympathize with the characters, I found the plot boring and tedious. I'm jealously guarding all my Georgette Heyers for re-reading, but with this book, I could not toss it quickly enough."
3,Least favorite so far...,"I love Heyer's books, and while this isn't my favorite, it's still worth the read. I found the characters to be less likeable than her others, and the plot seemed to be a little stretched and thin in some areas. It is much darker than a typical Heyer romance, so you have to be in the mood for darker and edgier. I think the book would have been better if the ending had gone a little deeper, with a bit more lightness to balance out the dark. Darkness envelopes the ending, and it weighs a so heavy by the last chapter that it is difficult to feel satisfied. There's a lot of focus on mental illness and death in this book, which is good if that's the main thing you want to think about when you are reading it, but I like feeling the warm fuzzy romance at the end of her other novels. This is not a ""warm fuzzy"" story, and it won't curl your toes like her other romance stories, but it will intrigue you, and maybe even give you the creepy crawlies in some places."
5,Good regency suspense.,"I like most of Georgette Heyer's novels, even the mysteries. This one of my favorites because of the added suspense and touch of drama. And it ends as most of her stories do. Sorry for the spoiler."
4,Great overall view of the Niagara 1814 Campaign,"I found Mr Barbuto's book well written and very easy reading.He not only covers the personalities and strategies of the 1814 campaign but also reviews each engagement from both British and American points of very, opportunities lost, blunders as well as succesful strategies and places all in the context of the personalities involved.The only shortfall may be alittle slowness to the beginning of the book as Mr Barbuto sets the stage and puts the action in context."
3,Fun toy. Poor craftsmanship,"I bought my daughter 3 of the Melissa and Doug Mix and Match puzzles. This was the last one that I gave to her. I have to say it is her favorite and the one she plays with the most.However when this puzzle was put together, first they did a poor job of cutting the pieces out and not all of them fit together well. We have had to do the puzzle many times over to get some of the pieces to even fit where they are supposed to, and even now they still stick. Also they shrink wrapped the puzzle before they put the pegs in the holes. So there were little pieces of shrink wrap that were stuck to the pieces because they had been glued in there."
2,Disappointed,"Although I have purchased several Melissa and Doug toys in the past, this is the first one that did not live up to my expectations. I could see little or no educational benefit in this toy. I purchased it for my granddaughter and she moved the pieces around several times and then just left it for other more interesting toys. I would recommend selecting a different toy."
5,Excellent gift,I bought my nieces Melissa & Doug puzzles for their second birthday. The girls love the puzzles and they are very educational toys! Would recommend.
3,"Cute and high-quality, but not that entertaining","Melissa & Doug make wonderful, durable products. My daughter pulls this out once in a great while, but is ""over it"" within minutes. Very cute, and it will last FOREVER. It doesn't get enough use at my house, though, and will be yard sale fodder in no time."
4,Good meter,The meter is easy to use and simple. I just got into orchids and this tells me how much light I have in the rooms of my orchids.
2,Light Meter Accuracy is Questionable,Unless I point the light wand directly at the sun OUTSIDE THE HOUSE it doesn't seem to register that there is enough light for any plant. I don't know much about light meters but this does not seem right. I have several plants in that room and they do great. The sensor is very small (about 3/8 of an inch) at the end of the wand and sets down inside the wand. The tip of wand itself casts a shadow on the sensor unless I point it directly at the sun. I think a better light meter would have a larger sensor on it. This one is useless to me. I would not recomend this light meter to anyone.
5,"Creative, inspiring, relaxing",Traditional and Contemporary piano woven in a worshipful and relaxing experience. Tom Howard has a definite touch on the piano which leads the listener to complete enjoyment of the majesty of God
2,Weber Carburetors by Pat Braden,"The book does not contain a schematic diagram of the 40 IDF, one of the most popular carburetors for Porsche 356 and is not of much value to me. I would not have purchased it if I had known this."
3,Personal Accounts,"Not what I expected. Very personal accounts of some of the locals. Very few and nebulous references to key details of the invasion. Not my type of work, but still not too bad reading."
5,yoga sutras of patanjali,"Yet another great book from the Bihar School of Yoga. If you are looking to learn from the wisdom of patanjali's yoga sutras then you should get this book. It is laid out very well, and will not dissapoint."
3,Soulfully satisfying,This is a great translation of the Sutras for the more advanced student. It takes you deeper into the meaning of the Sutras than others I've read but might be a little intimidating for a beginner.Like Yoga itself it will take a lifetime (or more) of study to understand it fully. It is not something that can be learned through intellectual study but rather through living the teachings.
4,Love this game,"played it a many years ago and wanted to see if I could locate it and play it again!! still love it!! game is a little limiting, but great for its age!! I last played it over 10 years ago!"
4,Very Refreshing!,"This is a very refreshing book from a bygone era! I enjoyed the language, the lack of sexual innuendos, and the author's writing style. Gene Stratton Porter was a gifted writer and I've read her books all my life. When I was a young girl I read THE GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST. I wanted to recapture the feeling I got from that book by reading Freckles. I was not disappointed!"
5,Freckles is a book from another age,"'Freckles' holds excitement and romance, honor and integrity, and a happy ending. It's from another era and embodies what I liked best in fiction as a child: expressing the highest values and making them my aspiration. (Although, there was so much of the story that I didn't remember that I wondered if I read an expurgated edition as a child.)"
5,THis is a great book that you can really get into!,"I am a 12 year old girl. I thought this book was perfect. IT is about a young boy who moves to the woods to work at the limberlost. THere, he meets a girl. He enjoys being around her a lot. But a bad gang comes and tries to steal trees. Freckles must stop them. With a little help, he can! Read this book anyone my age would love it. It's one of those really good ones you can get into!"
2,In the beginning it was nice,"In the beginning it was nice, but then the story--well--you can kinda tell the author started it with love and time and then just rushed to finish it."
3,Very old book with predictable plot,"Freckles was written over 100 years ago and the values reflected in the narrative certainly show the attitudes of the time. The descriptions of the LImberlost swamp are beautiful and make this book almost worth reading. It's interesting as a period piece, but the plot is predictable now."
5,A Story of the Heart,"Freckles (and A Girl of the Limberlost) remains to be my favorite storybook. Perhaps it is its beautiful simplicity, or maybe it's just me, the girl who never grew up. :) This book touched my very soul, I encourage everyone to read it!"
5,"Children's classic, emphasizing honesty, loyalty & character","Gene Stratton-Porter's first novel is an exciting adventurein itself, and adds great depth to her main character, anorphaned boy in search of meaning for his life. The boy,Freckles, exemplifies the best of character in hisencounters with the good, bad and ugly of society. He isa model for all children in his determination andperseverance, respect for his elders and employer, andgeneral moral integrity. Gene Statton-Porter has writtena textbook for children and a teaching tool for parents,well disguised as a vividly written outdoor adventure and(ultimately) touching account of one young man's search forhonest and true love."
4,Delightful....,I purchased the book for the title - and was not disappointed. The book drew me in with it's lively characters that were easy to relate to. Very easy reading and just a plain happy story.
2,"Unrealistic, even for back then!","I enjoy reading Victorian type novels, so it's not like I'm unaware of the difference in styles and morality expressed in them. However, this one was too much even for my old-fashioned taste in reading! I think when he kissed the imprint of her shoe in the mud summed up the silliness of the whole project. This might be a good and healthy read for pre-teens, but most adults would find it tedious."
5,Freckles,Freckles is one of Gene Stratton Porter's best works! I am also pleased at the condition of the book and the speed with which it arrived!
3,I will never get enough of this book,"This is a wonderful entertaining book that really makes you think.It has a little romance to please the girls,and adventure to make guys happy.It will make you laugh and cry.I like it better than Girl of the Limberlost,because it has more action."
2,"Freckles, Library of Indiana Classics","I was truly disappointed in the quality of the book from the Library of Indiana Classics. I wish I had bought a used, original issue instead. The type was smugged or missing in many places throughout the book and quality control is certainly not their priority or objective. ""Freckles"" is a marvelous story, though, from the early years of the 1900's and makes for a delightful read. Search for a better edition or printing if you treasure your books as I do."
4,I recommend this book.,"I tend to like characters who are oppressed, then because of their abilities and respect for others, can rise to a higher level in life. Freckles was a person who thought little of himself because of who he thought he was by a misunderstanding in his early years as a child. He spent his childhood in an orphanage, being mistreated and oppressed by others. Finally being told by a man who wanted him to become his son, he knew that he was loved and rose to be loved and respected by others around him.J. SimpsonAuthor of FROM A FAR PLACE."
3,A classic,"Although I don't like it as much as ""Girl of the Limberlost,"" I still enjoy re-readingf ""Freckles"" from time to time -- she captures the terrors of the boy alone in the wildenress. What I don;t like about it is its inherent snobbery, the implication that Freckles was good only because he was of noble borth."
1,Doesn't Last for Crutches,"I've gone through 4 sets in eleven weeks and I have not been very active with the crutches. Not only do they wear down quickly they have a tendancy to stick to tile or other smooth surfaces due to suction. I imagine if you have a cane and are sedentry they would be satisfactory but anyone that wants to get around and really walk you should look elsewhere. The end of my crutches came through my last set from carex after 8 days of use. The 5th set I have now is from medline and are definitely a better quality but I can see they are wearing down after 6 days of use although I anticipate them lasting longer, they are a bit firmer."
1,Tips NO GOOD!!!!,"I have had these tip no even 2 months... and I went through two pairs already, JUDGE FOR YOUR SELF!"
1,"This purchase was a mistake. The tips, one set is already worn out, and I would not recommend them to a friend!","Yes, I would like to make a comment about the Carex XL crutch tips ordered on Aug. 30. One set is already worn out and needs to be replaced. He is used to them lasting much longer. (These were a new brand he tried) The man in question that I ordered these tips for lives in the Desert, near Tucson. He walks everywhere as much as the weather permits.If you are wondering, yes, we have well maintained dirt roads. He has never had a set of tips wear out so fast. They were ordered on the 30th of Aug. and by 10/1 a month later one set is shredded, literally. He has been on crutches for years as he has but one leg, the other lost in a Motorcycle accident, years ago. He is afraid to try and send back, as he cannot afford any shipping."
1,Terrible,"Unfortunately, this book fell really short for me. It has the same problem most so-called romance books published these days have...absolutely no romance and just alot of cheesy sex scenes between two people who hardly know each other. There's no real tension between the two main characters so they're both totally underdeveloped, and it seems as if the only reason why they are lovers is not because they have deep feelings for one another, but because they think the other person looks good and can make them feel good in a physical way only. I wouldn't waste anymore money on this author's books."
3,"Could have been better, but not bad","I bought this to see Kid Creole but they used the same hired generic band for each act. The musicians were playing their parts correctly but the music sounded really bland. Only Chic had their own band which included Nile Rodgers and legendary drummer Omar Hakim. It was great to see Jeffrey and Howard Hewitt onstage together in Shalamar but where was Jody?! There wasnt even a female replacement, it was only Jeffrey and Howard onstage. I would buy this to see Chic, they did an awesome set full of Soul."
5,Eparaima,"What a blast from the past...use to hit the disco tecs here in Auckland New Zealand places called DRASCO'S, GOBBLES and BABES..great memories and I recommend this dvd to all the people from the 70's....cool as sounds...can't remember Alexander O'Neal but what funky raw singer for a big guy...Taveres...still rockin...Shalamar....far out....top DVD....."
2,It could be better!!!,"Sound is ok, but not what I expected. Music, ahhhhh.... well, OK I guess. Marco"
4,Bom show,"Foi muito bom ""redescobrir"" Shalamar e ver que eles realmente ""levantam"" a platéia. Chic, como sempre, muito bom. Aconselho a compra, principalmente para quem viveu e curtiu a era disco."
1,DO NOT RENT,"The video here is of unbelievably bad quality. It seems to have been a transfer from a video tape, and it is just awful. Even worse, the dubbing is laughable. Don't rent this unless you want to re-live the old days of bad movie theaters with prints that are falling apart and the dialogue that just doesn't make sense."
4,"Excellent writing style, weak economics","Mr Fischer's writing kept me entertained and enthralled. One has to set aside the economics and read the history. His storytelling is topnotch yet he data mines to force his wave theory. His ""waves"" stand out but one could recalendarize his waves, tell the same story and be just as accurate. I would like to read his other books, that is, if he is not trying to blind us with his insight."
5,a must read,"Well written and detailed analysis of a recurring pattern the author has identified across the last 6 centuries. The book is quite thick, but most of it are bibliographical and reference notes (very detailed) and a lot of charts, so reading is easy and smooth.The theory is well presented and clear to understand. Of course the conclusion cannot be definitive, as we are in the midst of the pattern and as usual patterns are easily recognizable only once they're complete. But the author does a good work of presenting the recurring and probable elements that would help identify what phase of the cycle (or wave) we are currently into. Please bear in mind that secular trends play out over many years although our consciousness tends to be stricken by shorter term events.In any case, a very relevant book for current times..."
1,Useless,"If you are completely unfamiliar with the internet, you may find this book useful. Otherwise, it is a waste of money. There is quite a bit of preaching in this book such as ""When these needs [of a mother AND father] aren't met, development is thwarted..."" While this may be true, that should be an entirely different book from this one. Advice such as, learn her date of birth (to find mother) or register at a fee based reunion site (of course to the financial benefit of the author!!) is offered and all I thought was that I could have thought of any of her advice without ever having bought the book. Several letters with happy ending responses are also a part of the book, but no step-by-step assistance is in this book anywhere. As a matter of fact, in the first paragraph, the author says we should all buy a different book on finding people...I wish I had never spent the money!"
4,this book helped me find my birthmother,"For someone like me who didn't have a clue where to start, this book steered me in the right direction. I found my birthmother's brother by sending for his driver's license which I had no clue you could do. The addresses in it are quite helpful. The book stimulates your mind and gives you things to do; keep busy and keep looking, shows you where to look and how to go about it. Thanks Norma!!"
3,"GOOD BOOK, BUT OUTDATED","I checked this out at a local library and did not purchase this book. So here is my review...It is good, but it has a lot of letters wanting her to find their family or friends. I admit that I did cry through the mother letters (people that want to find their mothers). Those were touching.It is a bit outdated and needs to be rewritten in a more updated version. Laws have changed and she needs to address that. However, she does point out the seed suggestion. You have to start somewhere. If you have the most pertinent information to begin with, you should be able to find anyone."
1,Just not enough,"This book is only an overview of topics, none of the topics are discussed in detail, so if you just depend on this one book to pass the exam, it is not going to work. The sample problems and other topics make assumptions without reference to where they came from. As long as you have other texts or good notes from your courses, this book is OK"
3,Engineering Economics is very well explained,"Geotechnical and Engeering Economics are very well explained topics in this book. Rest is OK. Over all, good additional reference. When you go for PE exam, the more you know the better."
3,Did not use much.,"Subject text is a little too theoretical. Explanations of sample problems are thorough. Content layout is very basic.I ordered this review book for the extra practice probelms. After it came, I realized that a solutions manual was also necessary. I compared content with the Lindeburg review manual, and decided to shelve this one.If you plan to buy this, be sure to purchase the solutions manual also--better yet, go with Lindeburg's Civil Engineering Review Manual (+Problems & Solutions Manual)--Lindeburg's are worth the money."
3,Not good on induction cook tops,"Although this does work on induction cook tops, it gets too hot in the center portion where it folds. I used it several times but went back to using a pan for omelets. I have not tried the poach feature but I think the water will cool it and work properly"
3,Eggbeaters anyone,I bought this hoping that I could make omelets with eggbeaters. This accessory works well with standard egges but fails awful with eggbeaters proving that something can always stick to a Non-stick pan.
3,Omelet maker,It worked fine but the screw for the handle was too short and had to be replaced. Haven't tried the poacher part yet but thinking the little handles might be too hot to take the eggs out. The omelet part didn't stick at all and flipped over just fine.
2,Broke almost immediately,"The magnetic kitties are awesome, but the main part of the toy broke almost immediately (one of the little platforms broke off). I tried to glue it back together for my daughter but it came off again right away. I suppose it's really not any less durable than any other Polly Pocket playset; they're all fun but not too well-made. Oh well, my 5-year-old doesn't seem to mind."
4,Very Good for the money,"It's very good for its cost. A little loose in the USB side, but very good overall."
4,Win8 Ultrabook - worked great,"I needed this in order to connect network to a convertible ultrabook, as part of the build process, before the wireless authentication allowed certificate load for wireless. I would never use it for long-term due to the very stiff nature of the adapter, and the distance it hangs out from the USB Port. It worked on a new Ultrabook system, at Bios Boot, while installing Win8 with no problems."
1,Worst Ever,Dont buy this. I bought the first one and it broke after a week. Requested another from mfg and it broke after a week. Its too bulky for a usb because with a eth cord in it will bend the usb part. This was designed by a guy who flunked out of engineering school.
1,Won't work on Vista Business,"If I could give this device less than a 1 star review I would. I plugged it in, loaded the drivers from the mini CD and Vista would disable the hardware. I tried other ports and same thing. I tried downloading newest drivers from their website and still nothing. I'm returning this dumb thing back to the store tomorrow."
1,not mac OS compatible,"Bought this item to add a USB 2.0 HD to my Time Capsule backup system and could not get it to work. The small CD included would not work in my slot-loading DVD drive so I went to the [...] web site to download the driver directly. After reading the driver instructions, it indicated that it was for Windows only. It does not say anywhere on the Amazon page description that this NT-USB20 is incompatible with Mac OS or 'For Windows Only'-- this info would certainly have saved me time and money in ordering the wrong part."
2,sound quality is very bad..can barely hear it.,i have not watched really much of the documentary...It DOES look interesting..but the sound quality is seemingly just awful. I dont know if the production company maybe made an error when they made my dvd set. I have turned the sound up nearly 3/4 of the way up..and can barely hear it at all.maybe i recieved a pirated copy? anyone can tell me who the production company is of this dvd set?thanks
4,Strange Record,"Much of it is unusually skeletal ... minimal ... weird. He seems to be not using all of his skills at times. ""Clear It Away' works, sticks in the head. ""Days on the Mountain"" is beautiful in places, quite poetic. ""Words From the Front"" is wonderfully mournful. ""Coming Apart"" with its layered guitars is in my opinion the highlight here."
5,The best band you've never heard of...,"Saw them open for Broken Social Scene a few years ago and was mezmerized. This is a tough album to describe; I tell my friends that it is both the mellowest and heaviest album I own... crank it up with some quality hifi gear, enjoy a few favorite beverages and you'll see what I mean. I have to give these guys full marks for creativity, musicianship, production and even the album art is wicked! The best compliment I can give this album is that I own several hundred CD's (of all genres) and this remains amongst my top 10 of ALL TIME. If you can find it, buy it."
3,Shoe,Shoe looks great but the size I ordered ran small. I bought about 6 pair of sandles this year and all fit well but they were bought at the store and I tried them on. These were the same size but were just a little small.
3,usual Americana,"The other reviews are too polarized. These are typical Harbison works, and he is a typical late 20th Century American composer (he's still alive, but is not writing 21st century music.)He really is more known for vocal things. These are all in the usual vein for when written in America ... solid compositions of a talented composer. He's in the central range of the spectrum of Americans these days, stylistically. That is, between Carter and say Adams and somewhat backward looking. He's of course not 12-tone or ""serial"". Best called typical of these times modified tonal. All are worth hearing for modern music fans. They are allgood enough to make it to my iPod list. I just might even recognize some of them when played(on shuffle), which is a positive thing to say."
5,Great teaching tool,This is a great book that outlines common problems that may arise with English as a Second/Foreign Language learners. It is organized by specific native languages.
3,A book that could have been better.,"I had been hoping to read this book for quite some time, but was in for a dissapointment. The book went nowhere, and except for a couple of parts (e.g. The princess visiting) I found the book to just go rambling. I suggest to any reader, Anne of Green Gables and its sequels, Pat of Silver Bush, Mistress Pat, and chronicles of Avonlea."
2,The life of a wild little girl named Marigold,"The stories theme is on jealousy. Marigold always has a problem with jealousy. When she overcomes it, she is much happier. I found the story to be kind of tedious. There was no real love story, and that's what I like about L.M. Montgomery's writings. There were some cute little stories about little girl friendships. I just miss the way L.M. Montgomery wrote her Anne books. The characters became so real to me."
3,"Wonderful,yet dissapointing at the end","Although I absolutly loved most of the book (especially the part with Hip Price-who knew that they had players even back then!),this book has the most disenchanting end in all of the children's books that I have ever read.Not only does she lose her cherished childhood playmate,but her free spirit.When I read the line ""she could now be as big a coward as she liked""( or however it went) I wanted to shake her and say ""No,Marigold! Don't let any boy ever change you! Always be true to yourself,and never,ever act cowardly!"". P.s. I am not a lunatic p.p.s. In the end it mentioned that she was afraid of frogs.But when she had the episode with the Princess Varvara it mentioned her having a pet toad.Go figure."
3,Sweet and light...,"A sweet book that I enjoyed reading. Not as wonderful as some of her others, but definitely a fun, quick read. I was disappointed to discover that there is no sequel to this book (it ends in Marigold's childhood/early teens), as there is to Emily of New Moon or Pat of Silver Bush."
2,Not one of her better books,"Unless you're an avid fan of L.M. Montgomery, you may want to give this one a miss. This particular story focuses on the growth of a little girl named Marigold, from her birth and the debate over her name (one of the better sections of the book), to her early adolescence. Several of the chapters were originally written as short stories meant to stand on their own, and they're definitely the best of the book. (The chapter with the Princess Varvara is a case in point.) Some of the other chapters are weak -- dare I say boring? -- and the ending falls so flat it's disappointing. In short, the book lacks the author's typical spark. She's better represented in her other books."
2,Tedious and dull,"Montgomery is nowhere at her best in this book which naver really goes anywhere. Marigold comes across as exceedingly insipid and by the middle of this book the reader is bored enough to shut it.The saving grace is the family discussion on what to name the baby,but even that seems stilted at times.Young and Old Grandmothers add some spark to the book but on the whole I almost wept at the thought that Anne came from the same pen as this dull heroine."
4,A great book filled with hilarious charecters,"This is a wonderful, humorous book filled with stories of a girl named Marigold. From her visit with a real live princess to the night before her ""Old Grandmother"" dies,from trying to be better behaved with a cousin to her introduction with lice, even the story of how she got her name itself is interesting!"
1,"Horrible! Dark, violent, depressing -- no mysteries here","What a waste of money. I love mysteries, and compilations are my favorite. I will open the book at random and read whichever story comes to my hand. I've read 8 of the 20 stories here and kept hoping for a good mystery. What I read was stories about people that the reader is given no reason to care about -- druggies pushing one of their number off a boat, a thief who meets a bad cop, a depressed divorced man who dates a woman while considering get back with his slightly degranged wife. Ugh. Every character a low-life. This book would have been fine if labeled what it actually is -- a collection of dark violent stories about men on th edge. I never would have bought it if it had been labeled properly. You're welcome to my copy if you find it in the trash."
2,A Wierd Collection of Dark Stories,"This was my first shot at reading a collection of short stories in 30 years, and I must say that I'm really disappointed. I expected mysteries - perhaps something out of a 1920's genre - but I got gruesome and morbid from beginning to end. I expected Poe; I got psychotic King. The only thing I can say for the editor is that she was consistent: it was all bad."
3,Benny Carter leads a big band,"It's not bad, but I don't find it particularly compelling either. Nowhere near as wonderful a late 50s Benny Carter album as JAZZ GIANT, and also not anywhere near as great a jazz big band recording as Art Pepper (+ ELEVEN) came up with around the same time. Carter couldn't find songs he wanted to cover for EVERY month of the year for this concept album, so a few of them are originals, and those (especially ""August Moon"" and ""Swingin' in November"") turn out to be the most interesting things on this album to my ears. Note: The last four tracks are mono versions."
2,I am paranoid now,This is a book for someone who lacks common sense and likes to read about other peoples nautical problems. To it's credit it made a few points that I did not know about but mostly if people think ahead a little from their actions a lot of these issues presented in this book could be avoided. I read it all but did not really enjoy it that much. The book may have served to make me a bit hypersensitive to planning to the point I try to analyze every possible angle.
5,Lifesaver,"This book will teach you valuable lessons in boat safety and preparedness, maybe even save a life ! It is a compilation of many real life mistakes and mishaps that can happen, due to ignorance or sloppy maintenance !"
5,What Might Happen,"Great way to teach lessons of boating. From the experiences of others, you can receive some invaluable tips to keep you safe on the water."
5,Seaworthy Review and is a good read,Seaworthy ReviewSeaworthy is a great read and a book that may save your life some day. Learn from 100s of lessons and mistakes boaters make in difficult situations that hopefully you will never have to face. But if you do this book will help you to prepare for the worst.Bruce
3,Good,"Good product as always from AEM, 3rd intake I've bought from them. I don't think they engineered this one quite as well as the others, but it is for an older truck. I needed to do some slight modification to get it installed. There was one hose, that you are suppose to remove and install a new one that is provided, but I found it was next to impossible to get the the hose clamp, so I just coupled the two together. Also, the screws that fit the MAP sensor housing and the air filter and bracket that holds up the whole intake system were too short, so had to go to Lowes to get slightly longer ones.All in all pretty good though, love these intakes in general."
2,No music or sign language signs,"I was greatly disappointed to find this big thick spiral ""music"" book (?) did Not have any music in it! There are no signs for sign language - Only words to many, many songs. It was very costly to send it back also. I wish I could have reviewed the inside when I ordered it."
1,Where are the signs!,"From the previouse review I was expecting a great book filled with words signs and music. All you get is a book of words and reference to a signing dictionary. You would be better off collecting the most popular hynms from your own church and making a signing chart yourself. Diffently a, pass it by!"
3,not recommended,"the book arrived in fine condition. but I have not found any usefulness for this book unfortunately. you would have to have studied these songs a head of time because of some of the word signs that are specific to this author's choice. if you're going to have to study the words anyway it would be better to bring your own church's hynnal home and practice your own interpretation of the song to summarize the words. for some who are total novices, yes, maybe to help learn to change your verbage down to small short sentence phrases."
1,It does not follow ASL grammar,"Seriously, can you say English? It follows English word grammar and not even close to ASL grammar. Only people with no sign experience could believe this book. This book has no use for me."
3,Iffy,"Ok my son was 4 mos old when I started using her techniques. The Sh-pat really works, especially when I have him over my shoulder and I rub my cheek against his. It soothes him and he quickly falls asleep. BUT I found that instead of EASY, my baby slept better if it was instead AESY, that is, if he slept on a full stomach instead. Also, I really don't recommend feeding a baby before you go to sleep. I tried that for a while and it didn't make a difference plus he was waking more often in the night. I guess my breastmilk doesn't sit well with him if he didn't ask for it! But I do like how she says you should never let your baby cry it out. All in all, I have mixed feelings about this book, especially because she comes across as very bossy and as a know-it-all, which annoys me because not all babies are created equal."
4,baby whisperer?...,"this is a good book but take it with a grain of salt. not all babies can be on a routine when they are first born for various reasons. my baby had acid reflux- my recommendation is just to survive through the first 3 months with what little sanity you can-especially if you are breastfeeding a hoover baby that went from 6.4lbs at birth to weighing 9.2lbs in the first month! needless to say he seemed to always be on a ""growth spurt"" as they say...anyway, good book just try to keep things realistic..."
1,horrible advice,"I received this book as a gift. I completely disagree with this lady. She recommends that one put their baby to bed with lots of diaper cream on their butt and not change diapers in the night. So, she recommends that the baby be left in a dirty diaper! Urine and feces irritates the skin, causing diaper rash and skin breakdown."
1,Not for me...,"The methods recommended by Tracy Hogg are not really meeting the needs of your baby. Babies deserve to have their need for extended in-arms comfort and companionship met. Tracy Hogg didn't even have children of her own. Our society's expectations for infant sleep habits are not based on their natural cycles but on pressure from other parents and ""professionals"" and parental convenience. If you want to help a baby learn to sleep on its own, read ""The No-Cry Sleep Solution."""
4,Wish I had read more before delivery!,"There is a lot of good information in this book, and I only wish that I had read this before my baby was born (because I had so little time to fully absorb the book while being a first time parent tending to a newborn). I would have had many more restful days and nights if I had! As with any parenting advice book, take this as a guide and not gospel and you'll love this book!"
2,Proceed Cautiously,"This book emphasized the need to ""schedule"" baby for naps, meals, etc. Remember that babies are wired a certain way for evolutionary success. It is not necessarily a bad thing if he needs to feed more often (especially if breast-feeding). Smaller, more frequent meals sometimes have a medical basis (such as if baby suffers from reflux).Also, forcing your baby to sleep through the night too soon may be harmful to his/her emotional and physical development. There is a reason why baby wants to be near his/her mother...because in harsher environments, those babies survived.Children grow up fast, do you really want to encourage too much independence in infancy? For the sake of your baby's physical/psychological/emotional development, proceed with this books advice cautiously."
4,knowledge is power!!!!!!,"I did not follow the book to the word, but I sure did pick up some tips that have really helped. I thought my baby hated to be swaddled, because she would kick off the blanket all the time, the book stated that babies like to swaddled, so I gave it another shot, this time swaddling her in the front and in back, so she was more secure, and it really worked!!! That alone was worth the buy. Plus I learned how to read her signals that she was tired. If you pick up a tip here and there from a book it's worth it."
5,This book gave me free time back!,"This book is great! I purchased it for the information on getting your baby to sleep. My baby was not napping, waking during the night and needed me to fall asleep. After just a couple of days on Tracy's PU/PD method my baby is napping so good and goes to sleep on his own. This book also has great advise on routines that really help you to structure your life and learn to read your baby's cues so much better. I wish I would have had it from the start instead of waiting for 7 months! I would have slept a lot more! Don't hesitate, just buy it...you will thank yourself later!"
5,Baby Whisperer saved my sanity,"Tracy Hogg saved my sanity! I only wish I would have gotten the book sooner. I am a first time mom, and didn't really have a clue of what to do. My son was two and a half months old, eating all the time, having a hard time going to sleep, and waking several times a night. I ordered this book and the first night that I tried Tracy's suggestions, my son fell asleep without crying. I was so amazed! The first time I tried it, it worked. Soon he was sleeping through the night, and having regular naps during the day. I tell everyone about this book. Sometimes it is hard to stick to but it is worth it. I give Baby Whisperer books to all my friends and relatives that are having babies. Thank you Tracy!!!!!"
5,Finally some sleep!!,"I am a big Baby Whisperer fan! I had read Tracy's previous book, and loved the ideas there, but once I had my little one, I found that I was having a difficult time putting theory into practice.This new book goes more in depth on the methods to use. I found that it was easy to understand and easy to follow.I also liked that Tracy spent so much time talking about how to troubleshoot the problems that may arise with you child. It was a very freeing feeling, to know what questions to ask and how to assess the situation, without always having to look in a book!Tracy Hogg was and is an angel!A Proud Mommy to a Touchy/Textbook Baby"
3,Good concepts but felt like a bad parent.,"This book has several good ideas in it and if you can take them and run with it then it's a good book for you. For me, I did take some of the concepts and they worked great but in the process the book made me feel like a bad parent. There are a lot of ""accidental parenting"" references that in the end just made me feel incapable and in the end I had to stop reading the book and choose another... (The no-cry series) that gave helpful advice without seeming to put you down in the process."
1,This book is horrible,"This book is unclear. At first glance I thought oh good a sample routine, however the author does not describe her vocabulary like ""cluster feeding"". As a first time mother I have no clue what that is and there is no examples just long winded vinettes about other peoples babies that have nothing to do with topic . Very Irritating book. Waste of money. Threw it out."
5,Phenomenal,"HiThis book has all answers for first time parents.Every new parent should read it, really.Kind regards."
5,Baby Whisperer,My son and his wife received a copy from their daycare provider. They wished they'd had it sooner.I've been buying copies for gifts the last 5 years! Parents give it great reviews!Great service from a great seller.
2,Not a big fan,"I thought I had some idea of what I was doing with my 3 month old son. I know that any book should be taken with a grain of salt, but for some reason once we got this book I felt like everything I was doing was wrong. Ever since reading this book my son's sleeping habits have gotten worse. Moral of the story. Don't just buy this book and think all your problems will be solved. Read all of them and make up your own mind on how to do things. Every baby is different and ours did not respond well to these suggestions. Pick up and put down is a joke if you ask me.On a positive note, this book is comical because the author is british and uses different words for things. Like calling a diaper a nappy. I love the british."
3,"Great book, but do not purchase on Kindle","This book has a lot of wonderful advice for a first time parent. We have been using many of the techniques with success. I recommend the book, however, I do not recommend purchasing the book on the Kindle. I made that mistake and regret it. There are charts and guides that do not format well and cannot be followed. Also, there are many references to page numbers for quick flipping to refresh your memory on certain concepts. You cannot easily follow this on the kindle. If you are going to spend the money, buy the paperback book."
3,"Quality book, but too large for quick help.","Since I am already sleep deprived with a baby who is stubborn and doesn't want to take naps and wakes up in the middle of the night even though he's 4 months, a book with over 600 pages of advice just made my eyes cross. I am sure this is a great book for someone who actually has time to read, but I am not one of them. I appreciate her ideas, but can we get a quick guide or something? My OB recommended a book called ""Baby Wise."" The first description she gave me is, ""it is short!"" Doesn't Ms. Hogg remember what it was like to be sleep deprived and have no time to yourself for reading much more than a few pages? Good for an expecting mother though..."
2,Too much structure!!!,"This book made me so anxious and neurotic about getting on a schedule, constant preaching about avoiding ""accidental parenting""... I ""fired"" this book after trying to follow it for 8 weeks. After doing so, I became much more calm and peaceful.Thanks to Dr Weissbluth ""Healthy sleep habits, Happy Child"". Our 6 month old baby sleeps for 12 hours through the night (since 12 weeks old) and takes two or three 2 hour naps. Our little one is very peaceful, happy baby.And we didn't have to do any sleep training, no cry it out!The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is some of the tips on soothing where helpful."
4,Don't Like Her Calming Babies Method,"I like the EASY routine. It help when I brought my newborn home, but later when he was upset her calming methods frustrated me and my son. The doctor told me babies-- when you lay babies down or when they wake up give them 5 to 10 minutes they may just be trying to get comfortable or find the pacifier. Plus, if you always do it for them when will they ever learn. I turned to Babywise and used the methods in that book to calm my son. It resulted in longer naps and longer nights. When Joel was 6 months life became much better we didn't use the going in all the time method. Also, in the Babywise they say a few minutes of them figuring it out isn't going to undo all the love they get all day long. Futhermore, Joel would be worse when I came in and out because he is easily stimulated and we never had good naps or nights."
1,Parenting with your head and not your heart,"This author, Tracy Hogg, left her two young daughters to be raised by her mother England when she moved to the U.S. That should say it all. If this book were presented as an option that may work for your family, then fine. But don't call breastfeeding on cue or bedsharing ""accidental parenting."" I found Elizabeth Pantley's books (mother of four) much more helpful with a menu of selections to figure out what works best for your family. Do whatever feels natural to you and works for your baby ... if some of Hogg's advice works, that's great, but don't let Hogg make you feel badly for your choices, those ""accidental"" choices are called LOVE."
2,Not for everyone,"This book worked wonders for my best friend and her kids. Her kids were sleeping on their own through the night before 6 months of age, and they are all potty trained around 20 months. I, however, didn't have the same experience. Her methods make sense to me, but implementing them seems very harsh. Every time I tried the pick-up put-down method, it was torture. I prefer co-sleeping with my babies and this books looks very down on that.If your parenting style is that you prefer your kids in their own room and independent from a very young age, this book is great for you.If your parenting style is that you are an ""attached"" parent, you will probably feel like a failure as a parent because of her opinion on this subject.I really appreciated the EASY method. It is very good advice on how to get your child into a routine and be able to better read your children's needs. Other than that, this book really wasn't useful to me."
1,Horrible!,"Simply put, this book makes matters worse! We used the pick up/put down technique to try to help our daughter sleep better when she was 5 months old and she cried terribly, we slept LESS in the process, and the worst part of it was that she lost trust in us which took weeks to earn back. I would highly recommend NOT even opening this book, unless you are looking for a very stressful and traumatic experience and want to break the bond you have with your child. Try Pantley's No Cry Sleep Solution and you will sleep, without trauma, all while keeping the trust in your relationship alive."
4,Lots of information,I haven't read the entire book yet but it's a good book to reference when a specific problem comes up. I've read a little on feeding and sleeping and there are some valuable tips.
4,The baby whisperer solves all your problems,"I bought is for sleep training of my 6 week old as she was getting overtired and not going down to sleep. Well, after a few days I thought it was not working but I stuck with the tips and by 8 days she was falling asleep herself and because she is better rested now sleeps 7-8 hours through the night! The baby whisperer was right. The only negative was that with the kindle version she mentioned page numbers and they do not exist on kindle so it was sometimes hard to find certain parts of the book."
4,For times in need,"I'm not usually someone who reads selfhelp books, but I really found this very helpful.I can't say yet if it works, will keep you posted after the birth of our little girl, but I'm excited to try it!I also think this is helpful for parents who feel 'lost' and 'confused' - let Tracy lead the way!"
4,Gentle and effective,"We loved this book. After spending three months with my daughter glued to my side for bonding purposes, I was concerned about transitioning her to sleep in her own bed or without being held. I do not feel babies should be left to cry, and the principles in this book were so helpful for us. After only a week or two, my daughter was regularly taking naps on her own. She was much better rested, as was I. I feel that we are well bonded and she is able to exert a healthy amount of independence."
1,NOT for a Kindle,"Absolutely a fantastic book. Loved it. 5 stars.Absolutely a HORRIFIC kindle book. Hated it. 1 stars.None of the charts transfer over in the kindle edition. Making it as a users manual, USELESS."
3,Take the Good with the Bad,"I began reading this book shortly after my first child was born. I was horribly tired (as most parents are) and deperate to find information that advocated a middle-of-the-road approach. I do believe this book lived up to that expectation. Is this book perfect...absolutely not. But it is a good starting place for someone who needs to regain his or her sanity. I do agree that her opinions are quite strong, and it can be disconcerting at first if your child doesn't react as she expects. But, her expectations do not have to be yours, even if she wrote the book and you didn't. You are the one raising the baby, so go with what you feel is ultimately best.Essentially, this book provides a good starting place for new parents if they are willing to accept the advice that works for them, and forget the advice that doesn't."
3,Just depends what you want,"If you're into baby schedules, you might like this, but if you're more attracted to natural parenting, you won't like it."
5,Answers all my questions!,"I'm pregnant with my first and found all the information in other books and on the internet overwhelming on what to do and what not to do. This book was recommended to me and I now HIGHLY recommend it to others. After reading it, it sounds like common sense now but I would have never thought of it if it wasn't for this book. The E.A.S.Y. method is my favorite and so simple to follow. Looking forward to keeping this book around during my little ones first years."
5,Simply a Genius,"The man(Mr Samons) is simply a genius.He could be President, if chose to do so,and of course if it weren't beneath his ability."
4,Good movie!,"Good acting by Richard Dreyfuss & Blythe Danner. The reason for the 2 women to be coming to the cabin was a little weak, perhaps. Maybe the accidental meeting could have been stronger. But all in all, my husband and I enjoyed it!"
2,Lightkeepers,Booorrrrring. Dull. Silly and not in a good way. An uninspiring story that I could do without. I clearly would not recommend this movie
3,Does not hold interest,"Although tales of the sea and this time frame the movie is set in would normally hold my attention to the end, it is slow going movie. Had a hard time watching the whole thing. Definitely could not even watch it the second time. Some nice views of the seaside. That's about all I can say about it."
4,Movie making at its best!,"As historical 'slice of life' Romanticism, this movie is simply superb.Well developed characters, excellent acting, good cinematography.Highly recommended!"
5,The Lightkeepers,"This Movie was like a breath of fresh air, true love story and wonderful characters. No cursing, no sex, just wonderful relationships, and set in beautiful Cape Cod."
3,Gentle Movie,"Quiet, soothing and relaxing; beautiful scenery; slow paced, yet enjoyable. To be critical, it was a bit slow at times and perhaps longer than it needed to be. But regardless, it was worth the watch. Having it as a freebee on Amazon Prime made it all the more worthwhile and risk-free."
4,"""The Woman Haters"" makes it to the screen after 100 years!","""The Woman Haters,"" a novel by Joseph Crosby Lincoln published in 1911, tells the story of an old Cape Cod lighthouse keeper and the young New York gentleman who becomes his assistant. Their male-only world is upset when two women come to Cape Cod for the summer and stay in a nearby house. Coincidentally the older woman is the estranged wife of the lighthouse keeper and the other is a young lady just about the age of the assistant lighthouse keeper. You can guess the rest of the plot which plays out in an enjoyable but rather predictable manner.A mere 100 years after the novel was published, we have the same story - very slightly altered - in the Lightkeepers. Despite the predictable plot, I found it quite moving - Dreyfuss and Danner are especially good in their scenes. It's a bit slow in places, but I recommend it as a delightful period piece."
1,Beautiful but disappointing,"The scenery was gorgeous, the actors wonderful, but the movie was slower than molasses. Great storyline. I just hope someday, somebody remakes this movie into the special story that it is. I like clean,no profanity type movies and this is definitely it. But it was disappointing."
1,"I had high hopes for this film, because of Dreyfuss","I had high hopes for this film. Mainly, I figured Dreyfuss couldn't possibly associate himself with a bad film. This film is so poorly scripted that it almost qualifies as a cinematic 'crime'. Long pregnant moments that linger on like frozen molasses. I was embarrassed for Dreyfuss and was wincing as he did his overblown 'sea dog' routine.The DVD for this movie isn't even fit enough to serve as a coaster for your cup of coffee.Terrible film, despite some gorgeous scenery. Much ado about nothing....."
1,absolutely terrible,"This was an absolutely terrible movie. Slow, boring, and a total waste of money. I wont even donate this one to the library."
2,Preposterous,"I got this movie because I appreciated Richard Drefuss performances in ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" and ""Always"" among others. The movie scenery is fantastic. However the story is too much of a fantasy for my taste."
4,Nice beginner set,This was a Christmas gift for boys age 9 & 10 who play little league. Great starter set for them. Have to make a mesh bag for them to carry the bases in.
4,Thorlo Unisex Moderate Cushion Wallking Crew Sock,"I had a big supply of Thorlo thick cushion hiking socks which were too thick for some shoes. These moderate cushion crews are just right and helped some athletic shoes that do not come narrower than A2 fit and feel better. My foot is very thin with no padding on the bottom and calouses build up, but wearing these socks help so much. They hug my foot and do not bunch up or wrinkle in shoes. They are well worth the price for me except I wish the top edge were like the hiking socks. These may not hold up as long because of the top edges. The hiking socks have stayed nice after many years. Also, because the foot part of the moderate cushion fits snugly and the part above the ankle is looser, sometimes ankles puff up but my athletic shoes may be the cause. They are still so much more comfortable than other socks and I wear them so much need more pairs. My foot doctor recommends Thorlos in an instruction page he gives patients."
4,Thorlo socks,"Pricey but good quality, thick and comfortable, I often wear these around the house with loose shoes, too thick to wear daily under work shoes."
3,Expensive,"The quality is great, but I was mistakenly expected this to come with more than one pair of socks. If you're okay paying the price, they are well-cushioned and look like they'll last."
5,Very cushy,These are very comfortable and have extra cushion where it's needed most (heel and toe area). I use these for work socks (office job) and they keep me comfortable all day.
3,Confused by the size,Product was noted for size which it did not fit. I am 10.5 and it did not work on my feet. They were to small. Needed next size up.
2,Too small,"I was very dissapointed. I have been buying Thorlo brand socks since 1997. I purchased size 13 thinking it would fit for a man with 10.5 size feet. They were too small and fit me, I wear women's size 8."
3,Sizing problems,"I don't wear any socks other than Thorlo, and agree with the other reviews, but... I wear a size 10 shoe and ordered size 11 socks. What I got was WOMEN's size 11, which are too small for me. The sizing is quite confusing, so I don't know what you should order to get a men's size 11."
3,Quality Down - Price up,"I have worn these socks for years and loved them. $10 per pair always seemed high, but I still chose to buy them at close to $13/pr. i was dissapointed with the quality, they seem much thinner."
1,Garbage,"If there were a ""zero stars"" choice I would have rated it zero. Once again we have a director who thinks that substituting his judgment for Wagner's to make some sort of postmodern point about -- what, exactly? -- is a good idea. If you think that too, you'll love it. If you'd like to see this opera presented by someone who actually thought Wagner, rather than himself, was the more important artist, look elsewhere."
4,This one will stay in your disc player for months.,"This album is not a cover album. It distills the essence of each track on Bob Marley's classic Natty Dread and translates each tune into the jazz idiom without lossing any of Bob Marley's sensibilities. The album is an affectionate and respectful tribute to Bob Marley. The musicianship is world class. The music is delivered with wisdom, soul, passion and humor. Anyone who appreciates reggae or funky jazz will love this album. I look forward to more great things from Charlie Hunter. He has deep understanding of the subject material."
3,Not as good as the original,"This album is decent as a jazz album but ultimately doesn't do the original justice. The Charlie Hunter Quartet takes ""Natty Dread"", one of Bob Marley's classics, and jazzes it up. The first two tracks are the best,in my opinion. Both capture the mood of the originals. The quartet's version of ""Lively Up Yourself"" is even livelier than the original, and their version of ""No Woman, No Cry"" definitely captures the solemnity of that original. The one other track that demands replay is ""Rebel Music.""The problem with albums such as these is that the artist has to reinterpret another artist's work without mangling the originals. The songs on this album are certainly not mangled versions of the originals, but they're not all that compelling. If you haven't heard the originals, you may have a different take on this album. However, if you're a rabid Bob Marley fan like me, you're better off with the originals."
5,"Perfect ""Horror Movie""",You really haven't lived until you have seen Francis Lederer as Dracula. I saw this so many times on the Million Dollar Movie but had to own it. Enjoy a once in a lifetime treat.
3,A good drive in horror flick,"The vampire for its time was a good drive in horror flick but I would have had to call it Mr. Hyde since the vampire theme just does not play. If you love watching old 50's sy-fy and horror like I do this one's for you, no nudes, no real monster and a bunch of poorly made make up."
5,Great vampire movie!,Well I know where dan curtis and got his ideas for dark shadows.this is a great vampire movie.the soundtrack in the movie reallygives the movie a scary atmosphere.francis lederer is DRACULA!
3,This Film Sucked (ha ha ha its about vampires),"These films are pretty much indistinguishable from one another but what they have going on is that wonderfully goofy Eisenhower-50s prosaic suburban normality that Ed Wood fought so hard against. These are marvelous period pieces and entertaining for camp aesthetics. Hard to watch as serious films, though. Enjoyable, for the obsessive collector."
4,dracula returns - again!,"It was a delight to receive this dvd because it had been one of my favourite 'modern' vampire films in my teend (I'm 60 now!) It was just as much fun as i remebered, and rather better made too.Lederer is splendidly evil and the rather bloodless opponents make a good foil. I know who I was rooting for....Thanks to all who made the trip down memory lane such a pleasure."
2,"Buy This Tape for the Commercials, if Nothing More!","This is Carol Butler's son. ""Green Acres"" has always been one of my favorite classic TV shows. But, this tape made me kinda upset. The shows were of inferior quality, and edited very badly. Especially the second episode. But, the worst thing of all was that the theme song was taken away, and replaced with an instrumental song, that sounds slightly similar to the original. But, it just doesn't fit with the images seen in the opening, especially when you see Lisa sneezing. We all know why she sneezes, but, you can't hear it on this tape.The best thing about this tape is the commercials. They're not the the original commercials from the show, but, they add a nice touch.If you must have this, buy it. But, like I said, the only good thing is the commercials."
3,"it's not THAT good, people...","It's a great photo album...It's a great collection of stories from the ""skinhead heyday"", but when you sit down and look at it, it's just a how-to guide, which is the most ludicrous thing the skinhead culture could ask for. Any Tom, Dick, or Harry wanting to be part of some ""cool subculture"" could pick up this book and think himself a skinhead upon finishing it. Although I credit it for touching ALL branches of the skinhead culture (trad., SHARP, WP, red), I still see it as a glorified skinhead version of Cosmo."
5,A great unbiased account of a severly misunderstood culture,"Spirit of 69 is a must for any skinhead (Trad or SHARP, even a nazi, maybe they'll learn their roots, or even the casual reader) It goes so in depth on the entire skinhead culture. It's so unbiased that it almost makes me mad. Marshall captures the mood and feel of the culture back in the sixties, all the way up to the rebirth in the nineties. The only flaw that I saw in the book is how deep he goes into the music in a skinhead's life. .... But still, a must. The only thing that I didn't like is that he portrays the nazi skinheads in a fair light, something that I believe they don't deserve. Anyway, have a good read."
5,"Great true history of the Skin ""cult""","This is by far the best and most objective book that I've read about the skinhead culture. While Nazis and racist skins (boneheads) tend to be what the media focuses on, there is an even larger percentage of skins that are non-racial and/or anti-racist.George Marshall cuts through the politics and gets down to the roots of the cult starting back in the late 60's and follows it up to the 90's (in the revisited version it goes to '94). This is not a ""how to"" book like others say, but an unbiased documentary of the culture. ""Before you go waving flags, you better know what you stand for""..."
1,A Missed Opportunity,"Buyer beware! If, like me, you have an interest in thedevelopment of the detective story around the world, but your commandof the various languages required, from German to Japanese is limited, please be aware that close to half this book is in (untranslated) Spanish! Not only that: each quote is labelled with a number eg quote 996 (appearing on page 19!) that is thennever followed up ANYWHERE in the ensuing pages. This should have been a fascinating book. Not only does the fiction discussed have intrinsic value but as much of the book concerns the period in Spanish history as the country moved from dictatorship to democracy, it should have given valuable insights into a crucial period. It probably still does (which is why I haven't sent it back). A valuable opportunity tragically missed."
5,love it,Put on my bass guitar gaves the right sound I like will made .Yes I recommand this product to you.
2,"Poca resistencia,bajo precio y baja calidad",esta cuerdas de bajo no ofrecen calidad ni en su sonoridad ni su resistencia. Su precio es bajo pero en el futuro prefiero pagar màs y obtener un producto de calidad musicalThis bass strings do not offer the sound quality or no resistance. Its price is low but in the future rather pay more and get a quality musical
4,Perfect for the Newbie!!!,"I have developed a deeper interest in martial arts, especially Taijiquan and Baguazhang, only recently. Dr. Yang's book answered many of my questions about the religious, philosophical, and spiritual roots of Taijiquan. I appreciate the time and effort spent in teaching this background information in the clear and understandible form in which it is presented. I recommend this book as excellent supplemental reading for Taijiquan history, philosophy, and understanding while studying the art itself."
5,A must have for Taijiquan Knowledge,"I've just finished reading this book and it was brilliant. Anyone interested in the art of Taijiquan should read this book. For information and instruction regarding postures, forms and Quigong this book is an excellent source. I've read several different books on Taijiquan and this book truly stands apart for it's quality of content and it's well written, easy to follow format.Thank you, Dr. Yang, for sharing your knowledge and experience with us."
2,Very poor quality.,"Good content. What I can't understand is why this book has so low quality of materials. Pages are wrinkled and passing through them is a pain ... They should lower the price more if they start printing like this. Not like other books of Yang which have much better paper quality. Shame on publishers. Hope this is an exception. Yang writes well about Chinese martial arts. YMAA, what are you doing?"
5,Bible,"This book is the bible of structural engineering of tall buildings. Every designer should read it and every time you want to design a tower, you should use it. Thanks for hectic effort Prof. Taranth provided to help the structural engineers."
5,This writer is very knowledgable,"Well written and the content is great. It's a great book for filmmakers who aren't even interested in martial arts or Asian action films. Lots of interesting things to learn, bot the kind that really makes you think and the ""OH NEATO I DIDN'T KNOW THAT!!!"" kind.You won't necessarily filmmaking skills, but you gain an appreciation for the history of HK cinema. It's a very easy to read book and fairly short."
4,Another fine guide to the Hong Kong Cinema.,"Hong Kong Action Cinema by Bey Logan is another good guide to one of the most innovative film corporations. The films that have come out of Hong Kong are a lot of fun and a lot more creative than the cookie cutter homogenized celluloid clones that Hollywood continues to crank out ad nasuem. Although Bey Logan doesn't go too deep into the history of the cinema (he's very opinionated) he gives the reader enough to go out and seek out the movies and other information themselves.The book doesn't capture the wealth of information and humor that he showcases on his audio commentaries for D.V.D.s (such as The Fist of Fury and the Celestial releases). A world a difference compared to the crappy books that have been released about the same subject matter (i.e. Asian Cult Cinema). I would also grab a copy of Hong Kong Babylon as a supplement.If you're looking into this genre, I would strongly recommend this book."
5,Step Up / Down Transformer 110 - 220 or 220 - 110,This transformer is attractive & of good quality. I was very suprised at the low price ; for this quality.Item performs easily -- does exactly what it is assigned to do . I could not be more pleased with this product. Great quality / Great price !!!!!!
1,The author of this book fails to be open-minded,"This book is a joke. To nearly every sentence as well as the title there should be added the phrase ""except for sports."" In 1969 when I was entering college, virtually all Americans, including those like Mr. Levine who were part of the New Left, were close-minded about sports such as soccer and cricket. Thirty years later the New Left still hasn't become open-minded about foreign sports. Neither The Nation nor In These Times could be bothered to run articles about the Women's World Cup this past summer, nor does Levine exhibit any open-mindedness about foreign sports in this book. His demand that others be open-minded rings hollow, given that he himself is close-minded."
3,Misses the point.,"Levine manages to keep his cool while all around him are losing their collective minds. Is it possible that he just doesn't GET IT? Richard Schwartz has done a better job of convincing readers that the whole postmodern ""thing"" is a tempest in a teapot. But neither of them seems to see that the issue is not what students read (when they choose not to read or are unable to do so), but why their instructors can no longer talk to one another. The problem is that the University founders for want of purpose and students wander in a fog. Postmodernism is simply a symptom of something that goes deep: cultural narcissism. As the world's problems become more accute, we find it more and more difficult to communicate with one another. Levine is sanguine. More power to him. He just doesn't get it."
1,not serious arguments,"There are two main arguments in Levine: 1) U.S. universities were not very good before the second world war so if today they are being degradated by the new ""concepts"" in education is not the end of the world. I do not think one must take the argument very seriously. Yes, the reform in the curriculum at the end of the XIX century was necessary but that does not make present reform addecuate. 2) the new standard reflect a more diverse society. But the problem is no that people is reading, let say, writters in spanish so they can understand the tradition of an important share of americans. The problem is they are reading BAD writters in spanish because they say what the left want to hear. In my own university, the reading list in the Spanish Department is just SILLY: second-rate ""correct"" contemporary writters, no Vargas-LLosa (a wonderful, but, ups, pro-free market author)."
4,Good Strings for Fender Jazz,I have been running these strings on an Active Fender Jazz Bass for just under a year and have had good results. The strings have maintained their tone and have held up very well through sweaty band practices / gigs / etc. Good buy.
1,Dead tone,The tone is dead. It sounded like the strings were already used. Nowhere near the tone of DR's or Rotosounds. waste of money
5,Incredible,"The first time I watched this I had come home from work extremely late (after midnight) and in flipping through channels before heading to bed paused for a moment on this documentary being played on PBS and was immediately mesmerized by Wooden and stayed up for another hour, exhausted, but amazed at this man.Its hard to imagine a documentary focused on a single aged man being one of the most captivating things I have ever watched, but it is. I recently re-watched and am buying copies to send to friends. Its really a gift."
2,SATA What,Fails as a controller: If SATA is on the motherboard forget about this thing working with additional HDs or CD\DVDs. Older Intel and AMD boards without SATA have a better chance of working with this item. Still have it in my parts junk drawer.
1,Waste of time,"I bought a SIIG SC-SAT212-S4 card a couple of months ago for a Western Digital 1TB drive- not as a boot drive, just extra storage. The card didn't work but I ended up keeping it because it took forever to get replies from SIIG tech support and I exceeded the 30-day return limit. SIIG guessed (and I mean guessed) that the first card didn't work because it was only SATA-1 and the drive is SATA-2. They told me to get a SATA-2 card. So I got this one. It also refuses to work. (I checked the drive, it runs perfectly.) If you do insist on trying one of SIIG's products, 1) Don't bother with their tech support, they're useless. 2) Make sure you allow enough time to ship it back before the 30-day return limit expires."
2,"Great Movies, Horrible presentation","There is no question that all these movies are all-time classics. I just bought this collection, only to find out that the quality is worst than copying from a television screen with an old camera.I have copies given freely through gossip magazines (in Greece, that is) that are perfect.Try to locate Italian DVDs, subtitled or dubbed, there is no comparison.pity,"
4,Warriors 50 Movie Pack.,"Warriors 50 movie pack. What a classic. Old memories return. This reminds me when I was a kid back in school a thousand years ago(time goes quick). I always looked forward to gladiator type movies.I used to picture myself as a gladiator in the arena taking on anything and everything. Warriors 50 movie pack has it all. YES, some of the movies are not that crash hot, a bit corny in this day and age. But who cares when you have 50 movies at this price. This is a great pack for those who are into the old sword and sandal type movies. A great pack for those windy,rainy days, looking for something to do when we have to cancel the fishin' or camping trip when it is too miserable to go outside. I enjoyed this pack even though some of the movies were not that crash hot (corny). Ruzer."
3,Mediocre,"DVDs offer 50 sword-and-sandal movies, some I have not seen before. Some movies epitomize this genre, such as Steve Reeve's ""Giant of Marathon"" and ""Hercules Unchained"". Some of the movies are outlandish, including ""Conqueror of the Orient"" and ""Hercules Against the Mongols"", unsuccessfully compromising different eras. The quality of the DVDs are satisfactory due to, I believe, primarily the age of the movies. However, you definitely get your money's worth for 50 feature films."
1,Tough to watch,"I own a few of the Mill Creek compilations, and while it is hard to deny the value of getting so many movies for such a low price, it is equally hard to watch the movies. While I enjoy the Horror and Martial Arts box sets I purchased, the Warriors box set is all homoerotic, 1950's crap. Most of these movies have no discernable plot - they are simply vehicles for greased-up, muscle-bound guys to wrestle with each other on film. I guess if you are into that kind of stuff, you might enjoy this set; otherwise, I'd pass on it."
3,"Great set, but missing its crown jewel!","Sure the movies are less than stellar. And the dvd transfers are lessthan desireable. But fifty sword, sandal and sweat movies in one set ishard to beat!My only real complaint is that this set is missing Duel of the Titans!The only sword and sandal flix that both Steve Revees and Gordon Scottstarred in together!This film is considered the Holy Grail of sword films. Extremely hard tofind, and if you can locate a copy, its usually in the form of a badly made bootleg copy! Hopefully someday it will come out legitimitly on dvd."
2,"Quantity good, quality not so good!","This is very good offer except for the quality of many of the movies in the set. Some movies are missing on the DVD (they don't play), others are mislabeled and many movies keep freezing half way thru throughout the movie. I believe the first master set of DVDs should be inspected and played on multiple DVD players to insure they play alright then copies can be made. Otherwise, all copies from a bad first burn will be the same.BMS"
3,"not the best quality,but then look at the movies they offer","sure these aren't the best quality transfers,but then these aren't quality movies!! but if you like these old ""sword & sandal"" movies (which i do) then you are in luck because there are more here than you can shake a stick at and at a good price. enjoy!!"
3,A Little Mad.,"I bought this set in the hope that Mill Creek improved these DVDs. I have a much older set by them with almost all the same movies on the DVDs. Well guess what they didn't improve on the quality or attempt to do a remaster etc.on them. There are remastered DVDs of a lot of these Peplums out on the market, but they do not come cheap. The movies are watchable and for the price you can't go wrong and they're good fun. I just hope that Mill Creek in the future will totally remaster the entire set and do a better job on the packaging. My old set the sleeves were made of cardboard with the movies titles and captions on them and were much easier to handle. This is much better then the dreaded paper sleeves."
4,mikey h,What a bargain! It was fun to see these classic sword/sandal movies againThe greater majority of the films are in good condition with a minimum of static I would recommend this pack to anyone who remembers these movies with fondness from their younger days Get the movie pack and sit back and enjoy
5,OUTSTANDING,"Admittedly the quality of the videos is not the best but as I recall they weren't that good when I was watching them on my black & white TV in the early 60s. So what can you expect? I bought these videos for one purpose only and that was to bring back some nostalgia from my youth when things were better and Hero's still defeated the bad guy.Unlike a few of the other people that reviewed this Movie pack I knew that there was only so much you could do with the media that these movies were recorded on. Maybe some day they can make them look like today's wide screen dolby DVDs, but for the price they were well worth it.I might not recognize them if the doctored them up too much anyway. This is a very good deal for the money."
1,"Too Bad, Steve Reeves!","What a dreadful ""rip-off"" this ""historical"" set is. While the selections are vast, the copies are sooooo shoddy, the colors soooo shifted and shifting, that whatever was exciting about these flixs of my childhood has disappeared totally. As far as ""Digitally Remastered"" is concerned--false--they just set the worst 16mm prints in a Telecine and let them run. No color correction, no light/darkness adjustment, and, certainly, no removal of cuts, bleeps, dirt, scratches, etc., etc, etc. I'm seed my set off to ""Badwill"". Purchase the new DVDs that are slowly becoming available like the new Hercules in widescreen. Great color and correct aspect ratio!!"
5,Rush to get LOVE RUSH,"Simply amazing! What a treasure. Ann-Margret tears it up like no one else with each infectious song. Each track makes you either want to disco til you drop or do the nasty all night long. Though there are only five songs, they are long. When listening you feel as if you were at Studio 54 with the thumping sexy music by Paul Sabu. It's a mystery why this wasn't a commercial smash back in the day."
5,They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore!!!,"Mutitalented Ann Margret belts out some great retro Disco music on this eagerly awaited CD. ""What I Do To Men"" is so smooth and sexy! All the tracks are great and you will play this one over and over! So gald it finally made it to CD!"
4,VIVA MISS ANN-MARGRET!!!,"What a rush!! ""Love Rush"" that is!! Love this CD for it's title track.Ann-Margret should try a comeback with electronica music in the likes of Cher and Madonna!!"
4,A Sizzling Album!,"Paul Sabu, who's music tended to be tinged with rock elements, was a very busy man in 1979. Just from the top of my head, I know he produced Debbie Jacobs, Sister Power, his own album and of course, the talented and lovely lady known worldwide as Ann-Margret. The overall feel of this album is steamy sexiness. The two dance hits from the album ""Midnight Message"" and ""Love Rush"" are pretty rockin' disco cuts. ""What I Do To Men"" is a mid-tempo song with a slinky groove. But my favorite track on the album is ""For You', the last track on the album. It's very sexy and beautifully produced. Ann-Margret has always shown she can handle all types of music and this album is further proof of that."
4,"Good album, but not as polished as later CDs.","A fine album that gives the listener hints of what is to come from Madredeus. Teresa Salgueiro's voice is absolutely marvelous, but at times she and the musicians are out of joint. But this was their first album and they recorded it in two days, so one can forgive a few mistakes. I recommend buying this if you are a Madredues fan. However, if you are new to Madredeus, buy Ainda, Existir, Espirito da Paz, or Paraiso. Fora gente!"
1,out of date,"this is an old book, not worth reading, you cant use this information in todays world, well my opinion, but i wouldnt recommened u waste ur money on this book."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews on this site I was excited to order this album. I love ""In the Deep"" (from ""Crash""), and ""Wicked Little High"" is terrific. The rest of the album was a disappointment. The songs were ho-hum and Bird's voice is pleasant but weak.As a side note, I did not like Bird's message in the jacket cover to purchasers of the album. She says tell your friends to buy their own, don't burn it for them. Hey, I won't! But why do you have to put us on the defense? I don't appreciate the assumption that we would do that to you."
5,Splendid Feast for the Soul,"This is, by far, the most unique of all of the music I've come across in quite some time. Reminiscent of Sarah McLachlan with just a bit of Enya and Sia, the music is fresh, with delicately haunting melodies.Her voice seduces and relaxes, while enlightening. The moods are dark, but there is always a light at the end of the introspective tunnel. Magnificent. It is hard to categorize this music, filled with sophisticated imagery - a feast for the spirit, by way of the ear."
2,Wicked Little High,"Okay... Now I'm simply Pissed-off. I took a bit of time trying to be precise and deliberate with my previous review - and this frelling review site cut me off...Suffice to say, ""Wicked Little High is little more than rehash of 2 previously released CDs - and with little more to offer - hardly worth the price. It's like listening to a ""Banana Rama's Greatest HIT"" album until your eyes glaze over. If Kathleen has nothing new to offer - don't waste my time OR my money. Save me a wad of cash and offer your 2 ""New"" releases on iTunes.I love your voice, but am seriously not willing to shell out hard-earned dollars for the same-ol-stuff. Be generous or go home."
5,high into sky,"being one of the honoured users of this manual iam pleased to say that steel construction & design engineering persons @ firms without this book are real ""symbols of steel knowledge poverty.""..i think it is vainless to shed light onto the sun."
3,Disappointing after all the hype,"I read the reviews on here, and bought the CD based on them. It just goes to show that my opinion must be different than most of the others on here. I love Jack Johnson's CDs, however this compilation didn't do it for me. The Greyboy song is great, as are most of his songs, but the other stuff seems like filler to me. Certainly not worth the $15 I spent, with only 10 songs!"
5,The September Sessions,This is an awesome soundtrack it is enjoyable and fun to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
3,"Love Jack, but not the best","So I hate to say anything bad about my Jack, but I must admit that I was a little disappointed with this CD. I knew when I purchased it that it was a compilation CD with lots of other artists, but I expected it would be a little better. I should also say that I did sample it before I bought it, so it is my own fault. I don't know what to say really, but it was just lacking that special sound that the rest of his albums have. I loved ""A Broke Down Melody"", ""Curious George"" and ""Thicker than Water"", but this one not so much. In my opinion the best track on this album was ""A Pirate Looks at 40"".Most of the rest of it was just OK. But I am still happy to have completed my Jack collection."
3,This may not be what you're looking for,"First, this is not a bad disc. It's listenable; BUT if you are looking for other individuals or groups who sound like Jack Johnson, you will be disappointed. The musicians here are a talented, but fairly diverse group and ""Thicker Than Water"" is, indeed, superior to this."
5,An obscure gem of an underrated genius...,"An excellent interpretation of the Bossa Nova style,Ike Quebeck infuses it with with a tinge of the blues melancholy and his signature light,ethereal tone that lifts you off the ground from the opening track,and your ""floating on clouds""till the last track ends and you have to come back down.Ike Quebeck had the magic gift of the ""light touch"" to his technique which had a distinctly atmospheric,sensuous sound in the way he played.Check out his genius you wont be disappointed!"
1,Lengthy arrival time/no tracking,"This book was ordered on November 30, 2010 and arrived January 3, 2011. There was no way to track it once it was shipped. I repeatedly requested the status of the arrrival but was told it couldn't be tracked. Then was told it had been returned because a portion of the shipping label had been torn off. Once again it was unable to be tracked.When it finally arrived I noticed that it had been sent from Toledo, Ohio, a one hour drive from the delivery address.I am very dissappointed in the length of time it took for this item to arrive and the fact that it could not be tracked.The book is is very good condition but it was meant as a Christmas gift.I will not use this business again.PJ Peterson"
5,My Favorite Christmas CD,"I have had this CD since it first came out and I can listen to it over and over again without getting sick of it. I like it so well I pull it out to listen to it in July. I like it, my friends like it and my parents like it. The five men in This Hope sing rich harmonies adapting classic Christmas carols and some new songs that really capture the true meaning of Christmas. ""This is not the end of the story,"" says one of the songs and the rest of the story is what This Hope is all about. Listen and enjoy these talented musicians in their all a capella album. I enthusiastically recommend the purchase of this product by all who love Christmas music!"
5,Great music,This is great music. All acappella. All Christmas music. The last song is the best. I got a great price & the CD came in less than 10 days time.
5,Great album... but not available at Amazon,"Like the previous reviewer... I rented ""Summer's Lease"" on DVD and loved the theme song. A web search lead me to their album Saylon Dola... but it's out of stock on Amazon. I hope they do restock it. I'd like to buy it."
2,"2 stars for art, 1 star for entertainment","Like others here, I didn't see the point of this. If you're going to go to all the work and expense of making a movie in this genre, why produce something that isn't anything. It isn't funny, scary, amusing, thrilling, or interesting. It's just a thing taking up space and consuming the time of people wanting a 90-minute escape. I'd rather put up with reality."
3,"If you like the show, you'll love the movie...","... but if you don't like the show or find it best taken in small doses, then this movie might be a bit much for you. It certainly goes farther than the show, but do we really need to see naked computer women ogled by aliens and whatnot? I say we need the REAL Jenny McCarthy to do a TTR movie, where we get to see an actual person, um, naked. Okay, that doesn't sound very ""sane,"" but you have to be into juvenile humor (and juvenile *attempts* at humor) to enjoy Tripping the Rift: The Movie.As the man said: ""For people who like this kind of thing, you will find this the kind of thing you like."""
1,Total Waste Of Time,"Speaking as someone who actually likes Tripping The Rift....don't waste your time on this worthless piece of garbage. It's three separate episodes shoddily slapped together, and isn't even CLOSE to being as funny as the regular series is. It's sad how poorly done this was. Talk about slapping something together to try and cash in while something is hot, this is the absolute worst. Go back and watch Season 1 again...."
2,I can't believe they call that a MOVIE!!,"That is just ridiculous..that so called movie is in fact 3 episodes put together. Actually, I saw them on TV last week. That was just a failed attemp to make money on our backs.."
3,the movie comes with season 2,"if you like the show, you will like the movie and season 2 as darth bobo and choad have at a wild adventure"
4,Animated comedy,"'Tripping the Rift' is 'Adult', comic relief from reality with some delightful new voices who were clearly having great fun with their animated characters. The story spoofs on many familiar movies and stereotypes. It took some getting used to when the film went from color to black and white in different scenes, but my eyes adjusted. I found other interesting movies in the previews that I plan to check out, such as 'Hatchet' and the horror movie 'Wrestle Maniac'. Please note that while this movie is an 'Animation', the humor is for adults only.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,Disappointing,"I like ""Tripping the Rift"", but found this movie very disappointing. Unlike a lot of the series, the plot is wafer thin. Somewhat like ""Epic Movie"" or one of those. There was also a lot of Gus and not enough Six. But that's just me.Overall, the makers seem to have missed an opportunity to really push the envelope on the series, rather then just cobble a movie together based on bits of other movies.Like I said, disappointing."
3,Decent Time Waster,"I had no knowledge of the fact that this was a television series prior to picking it up. Apparently it is four or so stitched together episodes from the series. In any event, ""Tripping the Rift"" is an adequate time waster with some truly funny moments. If you are into animated films that tend to rely on gross out gags and things of that nature, you'll probably have an okay time with this. Unless you are a fan of the show, rent it before buying."
1,Dull and painfully heavy handed,"In the first season the writers were content to let the audience get the jokes based on a few witty comments and the well crafted animation. By this point they seem to have run out of both patience and wit.One flaming queen of a robot is amusing, an entire bar-full of stereotypes, not so much.With the exception of Six all of the character designs are rather hideous to look at and the timing, jokes, plot and appearance just feel like the writers are coasting."
3,Simply okay,"I caught a few episodes of this show on Sci-fi and was somewaht entertained by it. It was a cross-between Star Trek with the raunchiness of Family Guy. But this DVD did not quite deliver.The DVD had its moments, there were some good gags but most of the jokes are basically restricted to T&A; jokes, sexuall innuendos and foul language just for the sake of being more ""adult"".Overall, it wasn't bad but it wasn't as well as I had expected it to be either. So, three stars overall."
2,Imagine the marriage of Red Dwarf and Futurama,"This is what would happened if it ended in a bitter, gin soaked, depressed orgy of recriminations and bad feelings. Uninspired, lifeless dialogue, unappealing characters, nothing terrible shocking for a program premised at least in part on pushing boundaries. And, I cannot stress this enough in light of the packaging, the only alien breasts you will see are not very attractive ones.It's pretty bad, folks."
2,"Rip-Off!! Not a movie at all, but episodes from the series edited together...","Like the title says, this is just a few episodes from the third season edited together to make a 78 minute movie. The episodes cannibalized were Skankenstein, Chode Eraser, Witness Protection and Raiders of the Lost Crock of */@?#!"".Just like when the Ewoks and Droids Movie DVDs were released a few years ago, production companies just edit episodes together and try to pass them off as something new. Just another way to squeeze us for more money!"
1,im trying to be nice but.....,"this movie was a dissappointment. i was hoping for something new, original and contributing to the series. instead what i got was a ""movie"" or feature length dvd with 3-4 episodes from the third season slapped together to give some sort of illusion to a movie. thats right people, this is nothing more than a few episodes from the third season chopped and then glued together with a few minutes of extra footage here and there.if you have already seen the third season on canadian tv then this will be a waste of time for you. if your planning to buy the third season then dont waste your money on this. however if your intentions are to not purchase the third season then by all means pick this one up."
2,Terrible reuse of episodes from Season 3,"This ""movie"" was absolutely terrible! It's just a combined re-edit of four episodes from Season 3 of Tripping the Rift. MY two cents: skip this and purchase Season 3 instead!"
1,greatly disappointed,"I loved the show but this movie was a major disappointment. I have no idea what it is about. I don't know what happened. Couldn't follow it. My boyfriend and I were sitting dumb founded saying, ""what is going on "" ""who is that Guy "" ""where did he come from "" ""what is going on ""?"
3,Could've been better,"I'm a big fan of the show, even though the voice for Six is different in every season. This movie wasn't as good as I had hoped and it felt they were trying to stretch things a little far on it. Bought it simply to have the whole run, and for that I guess it's ok. Unless you're a big fan, don't really bother with this."
2,"Unoriginal, poorly done. Not nearly as goos as the original series.","I remembered when I first watched the series on the SciFi channel, before like the folks at the SF channel always do, they killed off the series before it's time. After watching this movie, I realized that 30 minutes was the maximum each episode should be. This movie was just too darn long, unoriginal, boring and pedantic. ""Unrated"" just means that the characters toss off ""F"" bombs - this could be funny, if they were at appropriate or potentially funny moments. Alas, not. The animation - sub-par. More like a mid-1990's video game.The running ""gag"" was a takeoff on the Terminator series - and, again, without any originality. They also tried lampooning Young Frankenstein. And, again, poorly. Then they tried Desperate Housewives. And, again, they failed.I had hopes that the movie would be as original and caustic as the TV series. Not even close. Looking back on it, maybe the SF channel made the correct choice."
2,It's not good,"It's not a good movie, The season was good. It looks like they hired someone that has never seen the series to write this movie."
1,"Really, really awful","Calling this a ""movie"" is kind of a disservice. It feels like a bunch of half-baked ideas that weren't quite long enough to make full episodes that were then glued together with a bunch of sly winks to the audience; references to other, better movies; and gratuitous vulgarity. Trust me, I didn't find it offensive--I found it pointless.Watch Red Dwarf or Futurama instead. Tripping the Rift is vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, and it's just not funny."
5,Great book on complex numbers for the serious reader,"Good book, especially for introductory complex geometry. The theory of complex numbers is built up in black and white, no frills (i.e. don't expect to find any silly historical notes or color pictures typical of modern textbooks) and I have a feeling that the reader who even thinks about buying this book would prefer it this way. The mathematical exposition is generally concise, clear and rigorous.The only problem with the book is the occasional error. But the only errors I have found are minor in the sense that 1)There are very few of them and 2)They are numeric (The process is correct but the answer is wrong because of some simple arithmetic mistake)."
5,Democracy in California: Politics and Government in the Golden State,Item arrived in perfect condition. It was wrapped neatly so that it would not be harmed while shipped. Item arrived in a timely manner.
4,Shoulda Wouulda Coulda . . .,Elmo like CD very much! Very good horn playing and the vibes are really neat-o. Duke Pearson was a good arranger--too bad he died so young.
5,...jus gimme some more!...,"...if you pay 20 dollars for this you are gettin a bargain...i'd pay that for the title track alone! the combination of artists here provides us with mostly a lushed, cool jazz vibe, but on occassion they give us a little uptempo swing (still cooled out, tho!). if nothin else, then get this so you can front to your friends about how your musical taste has matured and evolved into something beyond top 40 radio!"
3,Not Grant Green's Best,"I'm a Grant Green fan. I have almost all of his cd's and like just about everything he ever recorded. The reason for the low rating is not because the music is not good; it is because there is just no way this is Grant Green's best work. This cd features Joe Henderson and Bobby Hutcherson more than it does Grant Green. And Duke Person also takes a solo on almost every song. In fact, Grant only plays one of the six melodies (the one for the title cut), and that one is played at a mindbendingly slow pace. Don't get me wrong; this is a good cd with some great playing by all involved. I just think it should be called ""Henderson & Hutcherson: Idle Moments."" If you really want to hear what a great guitarist Grant Green was, there a number of much better choices than this one, like ""Matador,"" ""Solid,"" ""Quartets with Sonny Clark,"" and ""Green Street."""
5,6 stars,"This cd could very well become one of my favorites. I just listened to it for the first time and it's everything I look for in a jazz recording: cool, contemplative, original. Bobby Hutcherson's playing on the vibes adds a funky slant. While the warm, fat, beautifully passionate sounds pouring from Joe Henderson's sax give it that smokey, after-hours feel. This is the kind of music that makes me want to rush out and buy the artist's other work. I just wish I had discovered the genius of Grant Green sooner."
4,Great Read for All Ages,"I read the book to my children, ages 8,7,5 and 4. They didn'tmove a muscle. They were so intrigued and fascinated by the story andpictures. It was a great teaching tool on bravery, heroism, foolishness and honor."
2,On Board the Titanic,"It is about Jack Thyer and Harole Brid that Expicrieces the ships very good details. This book makes you feel like you are really on board, and thats what I like about this book"
1,Not Complete!,"This is an incredible live show, but it was originally a two-disc set. There's quite a chunk missing. Where's the rest of it?"
3,Good Price - Poor Durability,"Bought these because they were relatively cheap for the whole set. After having them and using them for a year, they are beginning to deteriorate. Some are ripped and crumbling into pieces and others are severely discolored. Good for the price, but I think the weather is hard on them."
3,"Functional, but smelly","OK, this seems like it shouldn't be a big deal, but man do these bases stink! You touch them, and they make your fingers smell, too. They're reasonably thick, and they work well in our lawn. My 3-year-old now has figured out which direction to run the bases and the names, which was really my only goal. But man, the smell..."
4,good bases,We have not had any issues with these bases. We have even forgotten to bring them inside and they have lastes thru nights of dew and temp change.
3,"Great bases for outdoors, BUT...","These are great bases for outdoors for use like kickball, baseball, etc for in your backyard. Yes, they may weather the elements outside for a little while, but leaving them out everyday left them rotted and broke apart easily. Great if you feel like packing them up after a day or 2 of having fun, but don't leave in the direct sunlight or they will rot away."
3,Wiffle Ball bases,"The set arrived on time and is fine for the grand kids to play wiffle ball. The bases are thin, but are adequate for playing wiffle ball."
2,Poor Quality Bases,"I purchased these bases to play backyard wiffle-ball with a five year old.The Good:Lightweight, portable, and brings a child's imagination alive as he plays ball in his home 'stadium'.The Bad:These bases are constructed of very thin, flexible rubber that developed several cracks and holes after only a few hours of barefoot baseball. In addition to the poor material, these bases are extremely shiny and white; you may think that will make them easy to see but look at a base in the bright sun without a donning welding mask and you may never see again! I plan to cover them withDuck Brand 1265015 1.88-Inch by 20-Yard Colored Duck Tape, Winking Whiteas a permanent fix."
3,Good Product... Way Over Priced,This a great set of throw down bases. Long lasting and easy to store. The price that its being offered for on here is completetly rediculous. [...].
4,Very Complete,"I liked this book very much. I found the material to be complete and thorough. The only drawback is that coverage of specific platforms (4.4 BSD, Linux 2.x, etc...) quickly makes some of the material dated. Not a big problem because the vast majority of the book covers generic Unix that is cross-platform compatible. I think sticking to only *nix concepts would have made this a 5 star book. A new book is a little too pricey though so I purchased mine used."
4,Handbook good but not entry level,"After reading the reviews for this book, I rushed out to buyit. I have overseen operations for a Unix system but not been ahardcore administrator per se. Nevertheless I've had to perform basictasks to keep it going. I decided it was time to become much more Unixsavvy. I've read about half the guide and perused the rest. It is aclass piece of work, but in no way do I suggest it for a beginner. The text is written with a tone of sophistication and experience that the beginner will not grasp completely. It is a must to get the basics of Unix down solid before considering this book for administration. The Peachpit Quickstart series has been a great starter for me in many areas and Unix is no different. The book is a superb introduction to Unix...it is TRULY for beginners. Get those basics down and get Unix on your box...then as your second purchase, get the Administrator's Handbook...A first book it IS NOT."
4,This is a must have book!,"This book is excellent, definitely a must-have. The downside is the price. If you find it on sale, pick it up!"
2,Disappointed,"I got the book for help in administering to AIX systems. I discovered after I bought the book that the authors did not even cover AIX but preferred SUN, HP, and Linux. The authors also did not do their research to verify facts written down in their pages. I was disappointed and found another book more usefull."
5,half of the contents are same as linux.,"I bought this book for managing unix systems like, HP-UX, Sun and Toshiba(old fashion).HP and Sun are quite different.This handbook is a reference for the two system.Hal of the contents are useful on Linux.If you are Linux user, see 4th Edition."
4,handbook for sys adm,this book is really helpful in understanding and clearing concepts regarding the activities of a system administrator. i found it a good book to keep for your help in understanding complexities of a unix operating systems
4,Comprehensive!,"This book not only provides good introduction to understanding of Unix administration, but also unlike many books out there, deals with real issues and problems of system administration. Only reason why I did not give five stars rating is its price. Although this book can be invaluable tool for Unix administrators at all levels, it does not go into greater detail or does lack examples on some of the discussions, and therefore, I felt that the price...is not justified. However, I would consider combination of this book and another reference-type book essential in any serious Unix user's personal library."
5,Doubleplus good!,"For me, the greatness of this book resides in the cross platform explanations of how various system tasks differ from one OS architecture to another. Beyond BSD vs. SysV, I find the deeper I go the more different they all become. This book really helps cut through the confusion."
2,An Interesting Concept Album!!!,"I had never heard of Fareed Haque until our local public radio station began playing a few songs from this CD over the airwaves. I liked some of the arrangements...so, I purchased it. I didn't realize at the time that it was all a collection of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young songs. This is an interesting concept album, but I still like the original songs a lot better. Good effort!"
3,Rent it....,"A decent movie about a cycle of poverty and addiction...Brittany Murphy and Jeremy Jordan (yes, Jeremy ""The Right Kind of Love"" Jordan!) stand out with their performances in an otherwise Lifetime-movie-of-the-week caliber film. Worth a watch, for sure, and at a low price might be worth purchasing if you're a big Murphy or JJ fan..."
2,falling sky was sad,"was i the only one who thought falling sky was a sad but good movie? I liked that Brittany murphy was in it but also cuz it was one the movies of hers i hadn't seen yet.Her acting was great as a young woman dealing with mature subjects in her own life like alcoholism and young love.It was a different character than in ""Clueless"",the happy go lucky high schooler tring to fit in,but,in a way,she was still trying to fit in into life,in ""falling sky.""Also,I liked that Jeremy Jordan,former pop singer in the 90's,was in it,too as a guy she meets and likes.In life,Brit was gone too soon.She had much more to do still.The movie had to do with young people and love and family crises like an alcoholic mother and later a tragedy that made the daughter question her place in life,while dealing with death and abandonement.Good movie,but sad that Brit's gone:)R.I.P WAtch it and byu it from amazon for a great deal. Try it.You might like it.Peace.[[ASIN:B000062XJ0 Falling Sky (1998) [VHS]"
2,Okay single,"This was the 1st cd single which i had never heard before , the remix never came on the radio before, so i was upset not the real song I wanted."
3,"Good, but in need of editing","This book has wonderful ideas, but is written so poorly that it takes forever to read. It is plagued with redundant academic jargon, and ridiculous sentence structures. Hopefully the publisher (or author) will correct this in a future edition."
4,Pinch collar success,"I was impressed with the ease of the quick release although I would have liked a little picture to help be sure I had put it back correctly. The pinch collar worked very well on calming down a very boistrous 7-month old dobie on his walks where he might see goats, sheep, chickens, stray dogs, occasionally cattle and sometimes camels not to mention all the people milling around. I am going to go to a smaller size link just because dobies have very slender necks and getting the right fit is not easy with this medium sized links. But I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Satisfied!!,"Works beautifully on my 45lbs 7mos boxer, the pulling stopped immediately. I picked up the Large 3 1/4 mm and it was a perfect fit for him. The quality is hands down better than anything you'd get at a chain store, for 1/2 the price. I bought a similar item from petco ($39.99 plus taxes), and the chrome plating was peeling off it the same day, the prongs were too sharp, and the overall quality looked/felt like it came out of China in the mid 80's. It was returned the very next day. This item has rounded prongs, and seems to be a much higher quality.In a nutshell, I'm happy with this item. It's priced right, and the quality is superb."
3,Quick Release Snap = Lack of Smoothness,"Please be sure to get training on how to use these as you wouldn't want to hurt your pup with this. I have another chrome plated training collar but it doesn't have the quick release snap. I prefer it to this one because the quick release snap takes away some of the smoothness when one is administering corrections. I have to be careful to make sure that the little ring in the center doesn't cause the collar to catch. However, I've been using correction collars on my pups since they were little so I don't really have to administer strong corrections, just nudges, for them to realize ""Oops, I made amistake, I need to pay attention."" However, if I was just starting to use correction collars on my dog and they were bigger, which I've also done, I'd be sure to get a collar without the quick release snap, unless you have a nut that lunges so much they might hurt themselves. In that case, I wouldn't use this collar without training anyway."
1,training problems,"The fact that someone cannot take the leadership in a human/dog pack, does NOT mean that the dog has to be tortured, I have had several boxers and trained one of them for Shutzhund successfully without ever using any kind of violence; dogs are sociable and intelligent animals, maybe humans sometimes are not up to the task !!!"
2,Didn't help in training my dog,"I'm not bashing this product based on the same anti-cruelty stance as many of the uninformed reviewers on here are. I have used the product on a very leash dominant dog. Actually, it did not hurt him in the least bit even with all his pulling and lunging at other dogs. To my surprise, he continued on with the same behavior, despite using this collar. And yes, it was sized and fitted correctly. I did find more success with the gentle leader head collar in training him to walk properly on a leash. I got this leash on a recommendation from someone that I know and witnessed them use to great GREAT success with their dog. However, on my dog...it just didn't make a difference with all the behavior for which I bought it to train out of."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this item about 2 months ago and just learned I missed the window for a full refund or exchange. Very frustrating as this collar worked for the first month and then the clasp started jamming so I am only able to use it about 50% of the time. There is no excuse for not have a way to exchange a product that worked properly for less than two months. Very frustrating. Since these collars are supposed to be a high quality option, I'd recommend buyers go directly through seller so that in the event the product no longer works, there is a reasonable return/exchange policy."
3,sharp looking,"The collar is a very intimidating looking collar but it doesnt seem to affect my 16 month old rottweiler at the least he still stands up with it when he goes after other dogs in the neiborhood, in spite of me trying to hold him back. He has a very strong neck, but its good to show off. thanks"
1,"Does the job, but don't trust it.","I've always used a pinch collar on my Doberman. Recently I moved to a higher traffic area, downsizing his yard, and getting the old collar over his head for every outing was not working for either of us. This accomplishes the easy on/off, but I'm a little disappointed. The prongs are not as rounded as his other collar, and it has come unlatched before when we were on a walk which is scary. Wouldn't really recommend this particular one, especially for the price."
3,cute but leaves you wondering,"This book starts out funny and cute but gets a little annoying halfway through. The author goes from one pathetic date to another. Perhaps the book should've been shorter before I had a chance to start wondering why such a smart, talented lady keeps atracting such sorry dudes."
2,The main Web site is cheaper,"I was doing to price comparison. The Web site for The News has a rate of 69.00 per year and here it's 87.00 per year. Be careful, it isn't cheaper here."
5,Amazing!,"The lively descriptions and fantastic decor are all you need to dive into the world of such amazing creatures, as dragons are. Very realistic! I love it."
5,A Fantastic and Enjoyable Book,"The book was the start of the now popular series of books on the world or 'Pern'. McCaffrey creates a unique and wonderful universe in this ultimate Science Fiction fantasy. I world where an elite group of people are bound to their own individual dragon in a partnership that is lifelong. The book evolves into a fantastic and enjoyable story, complete in itself, yet opening the door to other tales. This is a very good story by a very talented and creative writer. This book will make anyone a McCaffrey fan!"
3,A good start!,The next books are much better. But this was good for the first book. The reader could really do a better job!
5,"In how many other languages can I say, ""Good?""","Never have I been so enthralled by a book! McCaffrey creates believable, FALLIBLE characters who have emotions which hit close to home. Yet another exemplary, wonderful, spectacular (you get the idea) work by the Dragonlady, Anne McCaffrey."
5,Without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read,"Anne McCaffrey creates a world we'd all like to live in; expansive, detailed, full of tales of deeds of courage, enterprise, and danger. The Pern series in general, and this book in particular, carve out a vivid universe, in which we can almost see ourselves riding on the back of a dragon through time, or locked in mortal combat with the fearsome lord Fax. I defy anyone to read this book and, afterwards, not long to Impress their very own dragon, to battle the omnipotent threads, or just to be there witnessing the events that make up this stunning work of art. Anne McCaffrey has definately secured her place in the literary hall of fame with this future classic."
2,Obsessed with Threads,"Started out great, but became too obsessed with Threads and not in plot, so stopped reading. This book was on the NPR Best Fantasy list, and I don't understand why."
5,DragonRiders of Pern,"My son and I are loving it, one of the best series we have ever read, more fun reading it together."
5,I didn't think I liked fantasy type books,"I'm not real big into fantasy books, but this one has me hooked! I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
4,Very good.,"More fantasy than sci-fi, but leaves you dripping for more of both. Interesting and unique perspective on Dragons. Quick-paced and action oriented."
3,Could have been better,"I liked the story well enough, but I thought it could have been so much better. McCaffrey did a good job of setting up the story, the descriptions of Pern, life in the Weyrs and the dragons were interesting. However, I felt that the main characters were flat and one-dimensional. I just couldn't work up any feeling for them. I also was confused at times with all the time traveling going on, and sometimes just about what was going on in general. Adding the time travel just seemed to be an easy way to ""fix"" everything. Plus the big nmesis in this story is falling threads??, so there wasn't even a good enemy to cause any real tension. Overall, I found myself bored with this book."
5,top notch science fiction,"For those looking for a great science fiction author,look no further,Anne will fill your needs,from first page to last,she will have you hanging on wanting more,and she can oblige with plenty more.Welcome to the world of Pern,after this book,you will want to visit often"
1,user-unfriendliness of the tapes,"My daughter adores the Pern books and when she saw the opportunity to purchase an audio book so she could listen at will, she jumped at the opportunity. To her chagrin, she discovered that the tapes did not play on her bedroom radio. The explanation was simply that in order to produce an inexpensive tape the cassette were double recorded and a balance mechanism was necessary on the playing device. We could purchase and adapter (which defeats the inexpensive idea) and then use headphones to play the tapes or use our expensive equipment which is located in our living room to play her tapes. Both of these solutions were unacceptable because her interest was to be able to play the tapes wherever and whenever without regard to the high quality of the components. Therefore, we decided to return these cassettes and continue to rely on cassettes from the library until we can locate a source which manufactures userfriendly cassettes"
5,"A well written, beautiful story- everything byMcCaffrey is..","I simply don't know how Anne McCaffrey does it! She spins a realistic, believable fantasy world around the reader, full of suspense, excitement, romance, beauty,and intricate story lines that NEVER contradict each other. It is very dificult to handle the effects of time travel, yet McCaffrey does it with ease and grace. Her characters are believable, as is everything about her remarkable books. These books are a must-read for any fantasy fan!"
5,Fantastic!!!!,This was a great book and a wonderful start to the series. It was facinating how Lessa went from a kitchen drudge in disguise to one of the most important people on Pern. I give it a standing ovation.
4,Fun book,"This is a quick, fun book to read if you have a few days to kill. I am definitely going to read the second book in the series."
5,Love the Pern Planet Series,"The Pern Planet series (by Anne McCaffrey)is great. The people on Pern Planet are settle from future earth, they lost modern technological and over hundreds of turns (years) have forgotten their history just trying to survive in the new world. The Dragons are bio-engineered from small flying lizards. The people and Dragons together ride the sky's of Pern to save the planet and the people on it. The people are so well written you feel you know them, as well as their dragons. Most of the characters show up in all the books as back stories so you get to see how they are doing too."
5,The book that started one of the finest sci-fi series ever.,"Well this is the one. The one that started it all. I first read this book when i was in high school, and thanks to this book and the others in the series i soon became an avid reader. Not of just sci-fi/fantasy but of all genres. I liked the series so much that i went out and bought all the books. It took me a while to find them (years) but in the process i have built up my own private library of over 700 books. Though the shining star series of my collection is the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey. Thanks to her writing i turned to reading instead of other less appropriate activities.... I hope everyone else has enjoyed these book as much as I, and I eagerly await each new installment to the series."
2,Poor plot twist,"I can't review this without a minor spoiler, so here it is...I don't like time travel as a plot development. First of all, I find the concept unbelievable, but beyond that you always end up with the same concepts (ooh, look, we have a paradox here). I liked the story at the beginning and think that the ideas of dragons that need to fight interstellar 'threads' was pretty original, but it just gets bogged down with the jumping between times. Also, I didn't find most of the characters very likeable. Maybe I would have liked it a bit more if I had read it closer to when it was written."
5,Great Story,This is the first book in a trilogy that was an all time favorite of mine. I bought the book on tape for my husband at Christmas. He loves it as much as I did!
2,So-so story...,"I'm sorry, but all of these 5 star ratings for this book seem a little overblown. I purchased this book based on these reviews, and quite frankly, I was disappointed. What was so ""gripping"" and fascinating about this book? Someone PLEASE explain that to me. The book was okay at best. The characters weren't well developed and in fact, I couldn't figure out why Lessa did some of the dumb spiteful things she did. Nor could I figure out why F'lar cared about her. The story was not tension-filled, gripping, or all that exciting to be honest. It was a decent story of a group of people trying to save their world from an attack by threads. Unfortunately, the story was told in a lackluster manner that elicited little emotion from me other than wanting to hurry up and complete the book. I have to give the author credit for being creative in coming up with the world in which these people live, but the story itself was average at best. Would I recommend it, No."
3,"Skip it, unless you truly love dragons","The story is quite complex, something I usually like, but somehow it's just boring. This has a lot to do with her writing style. It's monotonous. A lot of spectaculair things happen, but they seem to go almost unnoticed. She describes action from a distance. I want to experience the burning of 'the thread' in a dragon's wing. Just mentioning it doesn't get me arroused. The only bit of action is in the dialoges. These are relatively well written, although sometimes hard to follow (it seems one needs to fill in gaps). I kept waiting and waiting for Lessa and F'lar's romance. Hoping for increasing tenderness between the two. No way, state affairs are the only fun thing to write about according to Anne McCaffrey."
3,fantasy fanatic must,"although i am a fantasy fanatic, i also loved this book because it developed a story and made you feel involved with the charactersOkay Lessa, is the rightful heir, to her, town, (if i must call it that) and no one knows it. she's so obsessed with coming into charge of it that she ignores the possibility of becoming more, then f'lar, who by the way screams love interest, comes along and takes her to the major place in pern and he sets her up to sort of like compete to be weyrwoman. and of course she becomes it. then lessa goes and meddles everywhere and almost spoils f'lar's chances at being the major guy in pern was it called weyrman? that would be weird, anyway, he does anyway, and then, its all very happy ending, there is more of course but you'll have to read the book, ms mc caffrey did really well when she created pern, especially the history. this is a fantasy fanatic must read book."
1,I tried but....................,"I thought this was going to be a great read regarding the various reviews given to this title everywhere.The truth was that I totally agreed with the other 1 and 2 star reviews given here.The book just didn't do it for me. I would not recommend it.Simply put: Characters with no grace at all, you never really understand them, and never really care for them. The plot seemed good, but towards the end of the book gets really confusing and there was something in the way she wrote that seemed a bit unclear for me. (english being not my native tongue).I would recommend Lords of the Sky by Angus Wells, you have dragons and a wonderful story in just one book.Maybe the series grows a long the way , but, with such a big variety of new authors to read and fun to have elsewhere, I'm not going for Dragonquest.Beware everyone!"
3,"story ok, but ruined by other things","Well I remember really loving this series as a teenager, so I thought I would read this book again to see if it is good for my kids. this is not a kids book. sexual content- I wouldn't want my children reading it till they were adults.The story was great, but the first half of the book was really frustrating. The main characters were haughty and kept trying to make each other upset for the entire first half of the book. One of the dragon women slept around with different men, and had a baby not knowing who the father was.All that stuff totally ruined the book for me. The story line is great and could have been wonderful if all the junk was left out."
3,Another Fantasy Book....,"Unfortunately, I have not had the chance to read this novel or the other two books that come with it (part of a trilogy), but I've heard wonderful things about it!! Plus, dare I say? Stephenie Meyers (author of Twilight) mentioned this trilogy as one of her favorite books because it supposedly ""transports you to the place and time of the story."" I'm giving it a 3/5 because I haven't read it and I can't review a product I don't know the plot line of. But the purchase was at a very fair price. Definitely a lot cheaper than the local bookstore! Plus it came in pristine condition, so that's always a plus :]"
4,Lessa rocks.,"Let's be serious. Anne McCaffrey writes too much. Occasionally, of course, she has good ideas like the story of Lessa - the girl who can hear dragons. Unfortunately, the rest of the book is kind of boring, a bunch of dragons and dragon riders doing their thing and nobody cares about it for they are still focused on Lessa and her loves (her dragon and F'lar?). This is a great book to read if you like short stories - just read the part about Lessa until she comes to the Weyr. This is the story, if I'm not mistaken, for which Anne McCaffrey won a prize. After that part, you can skip it and you will not miss that much.Otherwise, this novel is a great example of fantasy novels - interesting enough plot, one or two characters are nicely developed, good and bad things happen, and the ending is more happy than not.I recommend it for sci-fi/fantasy readers."
5,One of my favorite Sci-Fi books!,"Dragonflight is one of the best sci-fi books I have ever read. It was the first Pern book I read. I stayed up all night to finish it. I couldn't put it down. Part of this book's charm was the way you got to know Pern and its people almost as if you lived there. By the time I finished the book, I felt like I was a dragonrider. It is a must-read for any serious sci-fi reader."
5,Great if you like Sci Fiction,"Would recommend the Pern series of books from Anne McCaffery, if you like Science Fiction. It is a futuristic story. Would recommend if you liked Aragon (the book)."
5,The Best Fantasy Fiction Story Ever!,"This book started it all! Anne McCaffrey brings to life characters so rich and deep that you will find yourself expecting to meet them as you walk down the street. You will laugh and cry with Lessa and F'lar as they, along with their magnificent Dragons, struggle to bring the citizens of Pern together to face the ancient threat of Thread, which is capable of destroying all organic material. You will cheer with them as they succeed in meeting Thread on time and destroying it mid-air. Journey through a beautiful time on a beautiful planet. Ride on your dragon along side the heros and lose yourself in the wonderful world of Pern. You will find yourself thanking Anne McCaffrey for her wonderful imagination!"
5,This book is like nothing else...,I loved this book. I read it over and over. I can't wait until Christmas when I can get anouther of her books. This book makes me wish there was such a thing as mind to mind talking. I recomend this book to one and all or are you to hidebound?
5,Loved it!,"The Pern series of books is one that I revisit often, and I choose ""Dragonflight"" for my first book to read on my Kindle. I wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed the book just as much now as when I first read it years ago. I love to get lost in the world of Pern. I'll definitely be adding more Pern books to my Kindle.This is a great book, and I highly recommend it."
5,Great metaplot update sourcebook,"Torg was Sliders, before there was Sliders on TV. Six realities (one Stone Age lizardman universe, one cybernetic Catholic Inquisition universe, one Japanese-style megacorporation universe, one high Tolkienesque fantasy universe, one Victorian horror universe, and one 1930s pulp-era costumed crusader universe) have invaded our regular, run-of-the-mill reality. Led by dark beings known as ""High Lords,"" these six alien realities quickly conquer and divvy up huge portions of our world.Infiniverse Update Vol. 2 is the second in a series of three sourcebooks that update the metaplot of the Torg game setting. It contains updates on the happenings in every invading reality, along with our reality, and friendly realities that later show up as the game time line progresses.For those Game Masters that wish to have their Torg campaigns be as canonical as possible, this sourcebooks (as well as Updates Vol. 1 and 3) is essential."
5,a treasure of keen observation and common sense,"Bedichek has a little classic here. It's a joy to read for anyone who loves Texas. The keen observation seems friendly and conversational, and it's salted with a background of long reflection on the whole human journey of care an hypocrisy. All the advances in ecological common sense over the past half century can't improve on Bedichek's perceptions from the 1940s. You gotta wish you'd known him, and heard him talking with friends after dinner."
4,A clever mystery,"Ms. Collier does a fine job in this tightly paced mystery. The plot has lots of twists and turns and keeps the reader turning the pages. Will the seeming curse of Foggy Grove keep another wedding from taking place? Where is the reluctant bride and why is her car parked alongside the road?If you are a fan of Ms. Colliers, 'The writers Club, and Christmas at Cliffhanger Inn,' then this mystery is for you!As an mystery author myself, I can appreciate this wonderful read!"
5,this is one of the best watches i ever had.,"this is one of the best watches i ever had, is so very well made and the rubber strap is so retro, is jus a really fashion watch,"
4,"Patra, baby","Patra is a very talented singer. Her lyrics are not so much about politics or religion as sex and taking control of the bedroom. Patra knows how to get the groove out of you. This album is incredible and a phat way to wake up in the morning. In terms of danceability, Patra is to dancehall what Rawkus is to hip-hop."
5,Takes me back,Anyone who remembers that era knows what this album means. This took me back to my dancing days and actually made me want to get up and start dancing.
1,fantasies of an old fossil,"Khushwant Singh occupies a special place in Indian writing because of his verstality and readibility. However with this book he would be losing a fair share of his fans. The reason: Bad, unerotic writing. This book is about the sex life of a MR Mohan Kumar, and in reality about the sexual fantasies of Mr Khushwant Singh. Yet while it does have the simplicity of a typical Singh product, it does not seem very beliveble. PArts of it seem inspired by Richard Crasta and others by a typical Mastram book. One wishes Khuswant should not have tried to write a sexy book. For sex stories only become erotic if sex is incidental tot he story and presented ina holistic manner. Out here there are dollops of it, but not very enticing ! Mr singh give us a better product next time. Remember u wrote Train to Pakistan once...."
1,Penthouse style story,"Definetly this book is not upto the mark of ""Train to Pakistan"" or ""Delhi"". Except here and there Singh's touches of human relationship(Mohan with his father, his Haridwar experience with his father, with Molly Gomes and before Mohan's death) and the ""short story like"" end(that is the reason, it qualifies for the 1 star rating), you can read the rest in Penthouse letters."
3,Son and his Father,"This book tells us a story of man and his women, but I can feel the love of a son to his father. I can find sex in this book, meanwhile it tells me I must love my father. Yes, Father is more important than a woman."
3,"Plate Mates good enough, but not perfect","We need to microload in weighttraining, especially for advanced dumbbell training. Plate Mates are great for that, although in my gym the plates tend not to stick to the dumbbells perfectly. This may be due to the gym's dumbbells not being perfectly metallic, but covered with iron. That being the case, the plates fall off during the set if you stick them in the wrong position. Sometimes sticking them to the inside of the plate may be better. I still carry them usually every time I go to the gym."
2,not a substantial documentary,"This tape is only 31 minutes. I hesitate even to say that this was a proper ""documentary."" The camera team followed Carreras while the tenor was making the film ""Misa Criolla."" The result seemed to me like a news report, uninteresting (in my opinion, that is) and impersonal."
3,See her live...it's much better!,"This album is an uneven mix of styles and songs and does not represent what Dodo Greene is all about. While some tracks are above average, most of the arrangements have a 60's soap opera organ feel about them, with a pop-rock rhythm behind them. Unfortunately, as far as recordings go, this is most likely the only chance you'll have to hear Ms. Greene. However, now in her 70's, she still is singing regularly in Buffalo,NY at Buffalo's Famous Anchor Bar. It is in this setting that Dodo shines, backed by a Jazz Quartet in a small club. If you are ever in Buffalo, make it a point to stop and see her show...she's there every Friday and Saturday evening and The Anchor Bar is the place that literally invented the ""chicken wing"". Fortunately, I have had the opportunity to get to know Ms. Greene, as I am a 26 yr old singer who opens for her. She is certainly one of the last of her kind...definately transcending the eras."
4,Quality not Quantity!,"Auntie Doe is my wife's blood Aunt. She is at her best on at least (9) songs and fair to midland on (5) others. Jimmy Gomes gave my wife a live tape at one of their shows and it is great. The Anchor Bar was home to the Chicken wings and to the Wonderful Canadians who would stop by to hear Auntie Doe sing with Jazz Example. I miss her showmanship and her honest personality, but I have her on tape so her vioce sings on. Love You aunt Dodo. Natty."
4,I'm ready to get the next book in the series,"As this book got started, I didn't think I'd read it to the end. But it surprised me and I got to really like the storyline. It didn't get into the typical love story and that was really great."
4,THE DUKE AND I,THE STORY WAS GOOD AND HAD SOME INSTENSE MOMENTS IN THE BOOK. I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BOOK TO READ ID YOU LIKE HISTORICALS.
4,Good read,"Really good book, pulls you in and holds you. Makes you see that sometimes even when you think someone has it all, they have their own crosses to bare."
3,immature dialogue... but still entertaining,"The ""witty banter"" between characters is very drawn out and gets annoying but the story line is fun and interesting. I enjoyed the overbearing brothers and the fight the heroine has against them! In the end it had some steamy scenes!"
4,Funny and entertaining,I love Bridgerton series....though i have skipped last three books...this one was nice...very entertaining...Julia Quinn really likes to portray her heroines witty and intelligent....i liked Daphney and her brothers....just adore the characters..including violet and surely enjoyed the society paper by lady whistledown with her cutting dry wit comments...
5,Really fun to read...,"Now, granted this is a romance novel so you have to keep this in prespective. Do I think this book will win the Pultzer prize for writing? No. Do I think this book will make a signifcant contribution to literature? No. But if you are looking for a book with funny characters and romance, then this is a great book that meets all that criteria. She bulids up the characters and the supporting cast to make them somewhat believable and the witty dialouge is pretty funny. It's the first in the Bridgerton series, and in my opinion, the best, although I highly recommend Romancing Mr. Bridgerton if you like the character Colin, and The Viscount Who Loved Me which is about the character Anthony. The rest of books in the series are OK but those other 2 books, and this one, are highly entertaining and fun to read. Definetly a good way to spend a rainy afternoon at home."
5,"Finally, I get to read the one that started it all","I fell in love with the Bridgerton's when I read ""The Viscount Who Loved Me"". After that I read all the sequels, except for The Duke and I. Now that I have read it, I feel like a void has been filled. This is such a funny, endearing romance, that will steal your heart from the first sentence. With subtle humor, and sometimes laugh out loud moments, and deep emotional scenes, Julia Quinn has penned an extraordinary novel. A big round of applause for Julia Quinn, and The Duke and I."
2,A Bore!,"Quinn's book is in a word - dull. The story line is not horrible, albeit somewhat trite. It was the characters, however, that got to me. They are in every sense two-dimensional, flat characters that prevent the book from becoming more than a dreamy, hastily thought out fantasy. There is no conflict of emotions whatsoever, and hence, no depth. And if the lack of originality and good plot weren't enough to put anyone to sleep, her diction fully drives the point home.I've read fanfiction by 13 year-olds much better in every way than this."
1,Let down,"I wish i could have said that i had to buy this book because someone was holding a pistol behind my back...unfortunately i was taken by stellar reviews, and jumped along with the band wagon.the story was completely under developed, the lines were redundant, and the pacing of the story was just so off beat.it was a story that had a lot of potential but did that pull through."
5,What a dream!,"This is one of the best books you can find. It's about a true relationship, one in which anyone could find themselves. It's funny and never loses its touch."
5,The Duke and I,"A delightful, light-hearted and funny read. Great content with tongue-in-cheek throughout. Characterization is wonderful, as they become as familiar as old friends."
5,Wonderful,"This book was simply delightful. From the first few pages of the prologue, I was hooked.The main characters were well-developed and lovable and the story was truly touching. This is some of Julia Quinn's best work."
4,Enjoyable romance,"This was my first time reading a Julia Quinn book. The ladies in my book club seem to recommend the Bridgerton series a lot, so I was curious. Simon and Daphne are a great hero and heroine and well matched. JQ provides a good look into the workings of the ""ton"". I will continue reading the series."
5,I could not put this book down.,Julia Quinn's books have always been a favorite. I regularly read about 4 to 6 books a month and this one has by far been a heart capturing tale about 2 people learning tolove themselves and each other. It was very hard to put this book down.
3,Too good to be true,I bought this book on the basis of all the five star reviews and all I can say is Ms Quinn must have a lot of friends working over time. Don't get me wrong. It's a pleasant way to pass an afternoon just no big whoop. Lots of dialogue. Lots of cute. Not what I expected after all these raves.
4,Love the series,Just happened to come across this book; was looking for something to read while on vacation and couldn't put it down.....
3,Cute,"""Cute"" is the best adjective that describes this book. If you are looking for the hero who rips the clothes off of the strong but virginal heroine...forget about it in this one. Yes there is passion, but there is lots of funny dialogue and interaction between all of the characters in this book. The story centers on a young lord determined never to marry because of a horrid relationship with a father who wanted the perfect son and instead, got a son who stuttered. He disowned him until he found out that the son had achieved inspite of his neglect. By then it was too late. The young Lord forms a pact with the sister of one of his college friends so that they both can be protected from the marriage seekers of the ""ton"" and from there the sparks fly between the two of them, as well as the brothers who want to protect her. If you like cute ""romance lite"" you'll like this story."
3,The Duke and I,"A story of a boy, a duke, intimidated and ignored by his father because of a bad stammer. His struggles through manhood to overcome this affliction and with the help of the love of a woman succseeds. Pleasant reading"
4,The Duke and I,"This was a good read, entertaining and kept you wanting to read more about the characters and how the story ends."
3,light read,"This was a bit too sweet and teenager type love story, was a light read and generally ok but not great"
4,A fun romp through England,"This title was a first for me by this author, but it won't be the last. It was sensual without being too steamy. I loved Daphne and her boisterous family, but especially Simon. I think you will too."
4,Sensational,"All right, I've just got to admit it: this book was incredible. It tells the story of two young people. One, Daphne Bridgerton, from a grand family with 8 children who are named alphabetically, and the other, Simon Basset, a very disturbed, yet very debonair and intelligent, young man. The two put up a ruse that they were attached, so that Daphne would get more suitors, but they ended up falling for one another instead. There's a wild tangle full of romance afterwards and ended happily ever after.The Reason why this book did not receive five stars was because of Simon. He had serious mental issues. And I found myself saying all through the book, especially when he practically had a hemmorhage upon being seduced by his wife ""GET OVER IT! MOVE ON TO SOMETHING BETTER! YOUR FATHER WAS AN [], DON'T LET HIM DICTATE YOUR LIFE!"" Of all the Bridgertonnovels, I rank this third."
1,Filthy. There are much better out there,"The story's premise and plot had so much potential, but the intimate scenes were too graphic. Ruined the whole book for me. Less is more when it comes to the description of intimate scenes. If you like wit with your plot, read Georgette Heyer. If you like soft porn read Julia Quinn."
5,A wonderful book,"I've enjoyed all of Ms. Quinn's books, but this one is by far my favorite. Very funny, and fast-paced. More ""real"" than her other books, I think. Definitely worth buying."
3,A little too cute and modern,"I couldn't get into it. The heroine's family was a little too modern - very 1990's while living in Regency England, and the plot line was a little too cute. I don't think that the author really did her research on the norms and mores of the times. Yes, it was a fun read, but it just didn't capture me."
2,Corny,"Poorly researched book. Many deportments that are anachronistic, especially with the class of people Quinn writes about. The main character, Daphne, has an arrogant feminist superiority that is cringe-worthy and also her display of it poorly fitting with her time. It is not that women then did not have such views but they did not behave in quite the way Quinn's characters are written nor were they quite so condescending toward their men.Much of the humour is too modern and forced which makes the book cheesy.The best part of the book is the beginning depicting the Duke Simon's childhood. It is a story of great potential. Unfortunately, many a good idea is ruined in its author's quest to create a sellable book for pop demand."
3,Great start turns into a dissapointing end,"I loved the first half of the book. The author created vivid, likable characters and interesting plot. By the second half of the novel the character's values turned into modern day values and it became an entirely different book. There was no hint of the characters as they were at the beginning and I actually rolled my eyes when there was a line around the belief that hard work always leads to reward. I've enjoyed other works by this author and I'll continue to read her books, but this was a skip-able one."
5,Wonderful!,"Julia Quinn has quickly become one of my favorite authors, and this book was partially the reason. I started with Romancing Mr. Bridgerton and worked my way backwards...and I LOVED this story.Daphne is someone you can...well, LIKE! :)) And Simon...he's a human hero that you can love. You just have the feeling that these two are the answer to each other's prayers from the very beginning, and every step they take closer to realizing it is a good one.Great book!"
4,Another great book by ms. Quinn,Ms. Quinn is a great story teller. Great chemistry between characters and fun to read book. Looking forward to reading more books from this author.
3,"Good Story, Bad Sex","I like the story, it was very cute and original. The book was a very quick read and kept my interest. What I found disappointing were the sex scenes; they were very mediocre. Ms. Quinn does not seem at all competent to write a good sex scene; the scenes seemed stilted, un-original, and quite frankly on the boring side. The whole point on reading a romance novel is to have some nice steamy sex scenes in it, but Ms. Quinn's were unfortunately created in an ice house. Too bad really, because I really like the story itself."
1,There is terrible and then there is this.,"DNF.While it was quite entertaining at first, I found it got irritating very quickly. I got about half-way through and had to give up. ""I'm never going to marry,"" he says but she replies ""But maybe he'll marry me!""I also didn't really buy the relationship, which made Daphne's feelings a little hard to take. These two weren't going to make each other happy. They were going to make each other miserable.Went and read some spoilers in some other reviews and it only really gets worse. Not wanting to get married and have children isn't something to be overcome. I want him to change his mind, if that's the point of the story. I don't want her to change his mind for him. That's not how you do character arcs. Characters influence other characters. They don't ""make"" them do things. That is not romance. That is gross."
3,Not Ms. Quinn's best...,"I know I am going against all the reviewers here...but I can't say I enjoyed this book all that much.It starts out really good and seems to have a lot of potential. Very funny scenes and I love Daphne's family. However it rapidly starts to fade.Daphne turns into a really silly ninny who puts up with wayyyyyyyy tooooooo much from Simon. And hot as he is, Simon turns out to be real jerk!!! His reasons for not wanting to marry or have children are really dumb. And it doesn't seem to me that he is willing to make any sacrifices for the woman he loves....As it has happened to me before with Ms. Quinn's books, the chemistry between the couple is lacking. They seem more like good friends than a pair in love.Ms. Quinn has done much better with:How to marry a marquisSplendid andDancing at midnight"
3,The Duke and I,It was a good read. I enjoyed the story of the way that Daphne dealt with Simon's anger with his father and her total acceptance of Simon.
4,What a Family!,"This episode of the Bridgertons seems familiar. I think I read it before or perhaps another book in the series. Since I favor series, I saw this one advertised and the rest is history. My intent is to read all of the tales of this huge family. A great historical romance."
5,Fun read,I'm a fan of Julia Quinn and this is one of her best. It starts the Bridgerton Family saga in her series.
4,Delightful and charming!,"What a delightful read! This is my first book from Julia Quinn and I am enchanted. For sure, I will soon be reading the Bridgerton series.Though Simon is supposed to be a nortorious rake, there was little ink about it. In fact, Simon appeared to be a perfect gentlemen in the league of rakes among the romance novels. Daphne was lovely and kind, with a touch of innocence but enough intelligence to not to appear too child-like. The secondary characters were charming too and I look forward to read more about them.The book was well-paced and the dialogue was very engaging. I thought I was immuned to being over-sentimental after so many romance books but I was amazed that my tears fell when Simon told Daphne that he could not marry her, after Anthony discovered them. Julia Quinn was wonderful in making her characters came alive and touched you. Though knowing that there would be a happy ending, it was the journey that counted and Julia Quinn had made that so vivid and charming."
5,What a book!,"I've never read a Julia Quinn book and I can't tell you how pleased I was by the wonderful character's and excellent story. The Duke and I was sweet, humorous and an enjoyable read all around. I have to say that if I hadn't read the reviews on Amazon I probably never would have picked this book up just browsing in the store, partially because it's longer than most Regency romances, and partially because there is a scantily clad man and woman on the back cover that seem more appropriate to the bodice ripping romance novels that I avoid. I'm not sure about anyone else but I love to read in public (i.e. airports, the dentist's or doctor's office, long lines etc...) and I'd rather not have that kind of cheesy back cover shouting out ""hey everybody she's reading a romance book!"" That aside, I really really recommend this book as a great escape from whatever you want to escape from."
5,Loved it,Read this for the second time as I came across it recently in some discussion forum on amazon. Go away with your one or two star reviews.... this was a great book - will start the next one now methinks!
5,A very fast & fun read!,"This book was given to me by a co-worker, another lady who lovesa good romance book & who is a huge Julia Quinn fan. I wasreally excited to read it, because I had heard so much aboutLady Whistledown. She was featured in the book, but I fell inlove with the characters Simon & Daphne. Simon sure was stubborn,and I think that added to his appeal & charm. I was surprisedabout Daphne's lack of knowledge of sex, but without that keyingredient, there would not have been a 2nd half of the book.I will definitely read another Julia Quinn book in the future,whether Lady Whistledown is in it or not."
3,"It was okay, cute at times","The first half of this book was great. The second half, not so much. I truly started to get irritated with Simon and his baggage. Thought he continued to be too unreasonable and ended up come off as a cry baby. Daphne was a great heroine, but I would have had to knock some sense into that boys head about 2 months sooner."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Publishing peril.Falco is still toiling away till late hours at times working on his writing, and here he falls in with a banker/publishers that plays up to struggling writers.Falco gets in trouble again when a man dies via a literary blunt implement, and with Petronius' help he gets to investigate and find out what is going on.Like Last Act In Palmyra, the whole publishing thing may be of little interest to some, and this does detract a bit in general from the book making this one of the lesser entries in this series."
2,Verbose and far too long,"What's annoying in this novel is the basically modern theme, modern considerations on crime and society, modern talking in a supposed Rome under the Flavians. coupled with ""There's a body in the library!"", the stalest premise of english whodunits. Where is the flavor of antiquity? And how can one justify the homophobic slur at Maecenas in a Rome where ""greek love"" was common, and only being overtly passive was frowned upon?Steven Saylor's Gordianus the Finder's series is better rooted in history, and less plagued by a plethora of relatives."
3,A Bit of a Disappointment...,"I remember when I first discovered this series. I couldn't get enough of Falco! This was about two years ago. I bought this book and it has sat on my shelf for quite awhile; getting lost in the mounds of books I need to read. This weekend I decided to pull it out and re-visit ancient Rome. This book was a bit of a disappointment. I began to get bored at some point and question why I had liked this series. The plot just meandered around. It seemed unreal to me that Falco just ""forgot"" to check up on some basic facts and alibis. Falco and Lindsey Davis both seemed really tired. I am not giving up on the series...I hope to read more...I just hope that they are a little livelier. Hopefully this will be the only Dud in the bunch. I gave this three stars because I do love Falco and the gang so much, and hope does spring eternal..."
5,Magnificent!!!!! The best ever for Everett Harp!!!!!!!!,"Harp's tribute to Marvin Gaye is truly a work of art, as was Marvin. There is so much feeling in ""What's Going On?"". This is one of those rare cd's that you will want to play from start to finish again and again!!"
1,Disappoint with the Shipper of this product.,"I return this item because while the CD cover said it was Everett Harp What's Going On, the CD inside was not this CD."
5,Excellent CD purchased at Amazon.com,"Could'nt wait to get the CD I ordered from Amazon.com and when it arrived earlier than estimated, I played it over and over. It is absolutely amazing. I urge you to buy it if you enjoy Marvin Gaye's ""Whats going on?"""
4,Marvin Gaye would be proud,"Everette Harp is a fantastic sax player and What's Going On is a great album. However, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't care for all of the songs on the album--not because they weren't good but because they just weren't my taste. However, I am sure many of you will love the songs--it's just hard to measure a personal preference. Having said that, this album is worth every penny for ""What's Going On"" and ""Mercy Mercy Me"" alone. The 30 second clips were all I needed to hear to jump on buying it and the full version is beyond words...but ""goodness, gracious"" comes to mind. Fantastic!!!"
2,Too Big,"I purchased the DiGiMemo digital notepad (which is great) and needed a case to protect it from the beating it was taking in my bag. The product is nice, but it is HUGE! It's bigger than my 15"" laptop. And when I take it out at meetings to use, I end up using way more space than I should.They need to offer something a little more inconspicuous. It's just too darn big."
1,pleather,I was disappointmed in the quality of this product. It is not necessary to have this as part of the digimemo. Save your money. I returned mine for a full refund within a few days of purchase.
2,Works great.....when it works,which is about every third or forth time I've tried to use it. Documentation with the device is minimal as is documentation on the manufacturer's web site. Contacting the manufacturer for assistance results in a slow response 3-4 days and isn't always helpful.I would suggest passing on this and waiting until the concept is better developed.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Actually ZERO stars but website won't accept this without one star.Very disappointing outcome....We were so excited about getting this product...took quite some time to set it up..dowloand software, input practice samples and so on. It recordedthe first couple pages of sample writing and then just stopped. No trouble-shooting suggestions worked. No tech support helped. It may well have been just the pen, in such case, two pens, with batteries, should be included . We sent it back for refund. Ken Johnson"
5,Can't do without these pins if you are growing a veggie garden with fabric topping!,"I decided to do something different this year with my veggie garden and covered the rows with DeWitt Miracle Mat. I used these pins to hold down the fabric to the row and it has worked out perfectly. The pins do not tear the fabric and once you place them, they do not slip out.But, I have found another use for these pins. I bought soaker hoses for my garden and these pins hold the hoses in place where I set the hose. I was having a heck of a time keeping the hoses in place near the root of the plants and these pins do the trick! Now the hose does not roll off the row or pull away from the plant. One pin will hold the hose where you need it. Great product with numerous uses!!"
2,Rust Rust Rust!,It does serves it purpose and reasonably priced. Used it to pin down lawn nettings. It rusted so badly within days of exposure to rain; leaving rust stains on my nets and mulch. But can't complain for its price since it did stop the birds from eating my lawn seedlings.
3,Handy and Rusty,"Rusts quickly but does the job, I would still recommend them for placing your garden paper down though, because what else can you use."
4,Worked fine.,"I had a project to finish up, and the local store had no more landscape pins. These were longer then I really needed, but worked fine."
3,useful but rust easy -not galvanized,"these fabric pins were great for holding down drip line hoses and also some weed fabric i put down. However, when i went around doing my fall cleaning, i found the pins did not cleanly pull out and sometimes tore the fabric when removing. In just 1 growing season they rusted quite heavily, almost 2x in diameter. They are clearly not stainless steel or galvanized. So as long as you don't intend to re-use or move these around much, they should work just fine."
4,Great price and quality,"These fabric pins are about 1 inch longer, and are a heavier gauge of steel than a similar product at Home Depot that costs more."
2,Not so much...,These lawn pins were not as heavy duty as we had hoped and did not get the job done. We ended up returning this item.
5,Simple and functional,"Not sure how much of a review can be written about ground staples for fabric, but I can say that, having never used these before, they got the job done very nicely in combination with a frost blanket that I bought on Amazon at the same time. They are deep enough, and hold everything down efficiently, so that the fabric will not blow away (under normal conditions - hurricanes excluded)."
3,"Jar of angst-laden techno flies, then falls.","Having trounced ""Conquers..."" some time ago, admittedly harshly, I was initially excited to hear this album, having heard and enjoyed the first track (probably on the same radio program as the reviewer from Madison). It's enticingly dark, and it's got a real bite to it as well, unfortunately quite unlike the rest of the album. While tight, there's no oomph, lyrically or musically, to elevate this album above decency. The remix (!) of ""Injected..."" should've been a hidden track, and there's still room for plenty more (like an 8-minute epic climax which PK just seems incapable of...instead it goes out with a whimper). Repetitive vocals range from subversive prodigy-style mini-rants to swooning vixen ""ooo""'s (like bad trance music), which are often annoying but necessary to spice up music which can't really stand alone. Though undoubtedly improved, PK remains a poor man's Prodigy. Jeers to the latter, however, for its lack of anything original lately."
4,A well done American industrial album,"Pragamatic is pretty good for an American techno/industrial album. Praga Khan (also a member of Lords Of Acid) uses a musical style that can be roughly described as Prodigy meets Nine Inch Nails. The lyrics are all rather depressing (like Nine Inch Nails), but the music often has an upbeat feel to it (not unlike Prodigy). The end result is a melding of electronic music that works and sounds well. There are a few fast songs on Pragamatic, but most are slower, although still good. The bonus disc that comes with Pragamatic by Lords Of Acid isn't very good, but it's just a bonus anyway."
5,does its job,"this really smooths every where it should. i am a size 4-6 and purchased a med. cant imagine fitting in a small(my normal size). would recommend going up 1 size. loved it so much i bought 2, one in black one in nude."
5,"medals holds up very nicely,","I really enjoy Russ Taff s gut centered ,honest vocals. he delivers as usual. when I listen to medals and then listen to modern CCM, one question beggs to be asked, what has happened to all the great contemporary christian music?"
4,my son loves the shape,"the cutters themselves are lovely, we're very pleased with them, it's just too bad that they didn't come with more cutters and a case for their protection."
1,"This book is horrible, Do not buy this book !!!",I had this instructor at LSU may years ago. The class was much better than the book. The book is poorly organized as are the examples. I have read many circuit analysis books and this is definitely the worst.
1,I agree with other reviewers,"Take my suggestion: ""Don't ever buy this book"". I am a second year student and my school use this book as a text for Introduction to EE. Since my instructor is so bad in explanation, at the very beginning, I thought, I could rely on this text for understanding. I HAVE READ EVERY SINGLE WORD IN THE FIRST TWO CHAPTERS AND REPEATED SO MANY TIMES AND STILL, I DON'T COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THINGS. Very vey hard to follow. If you don't believe what I said, read it yourself before buying it."
1,Errors everywhere,"With all the errors in the fifth edition of Basic Electric Circuit Analysis, I shudder to think what the earlier editions were like. This may have been a classic but the content in this edition is soured by the lack of attention to detail. As a first time student to circuit analysis, I expected to rely on the information contained in the book. I was treated instead by numerous misleading statements and downright incorrect answers to exercises. This is the first time in my third year as an undergraduate that a textbook has caused me this much grief."
1,NOT STUDENT FRIENDLY,"I used the 4th edition at my university. I looked through the 5th edition in hopes of seeing improvements. There are none. If you are unfortunate enough to need this book for class; I am sorry. There are much better texts out there. This book, or the authors, seem to take pride in making this material harder than it actually is. Don't expect to learn from this book, find other resources"
1,garbage,"Beyond a doubt, this is perhaps the biggest piece of disposable pop trash to come along in quite a while (or at least since Silverchair)"
5,"Excellent!! I love ""Closing Time"" and 'Singing in My Sleep.""","I bought this album after hearing ""Closing Time"" on the radio, and I thought that it would be the only good song. However, most of the songs are excellent. The best songs, in addition to ""Closing Time,"" are ""Singing in My Sleep,"" ""Never You Mind,"" ""DND,"" and ""This Will Be My Year."" The rest of the songs are okay except for ""She Spreads Her Wings,"" which is my least favorite song on the album. Overall, it is an excellent record for those who like bands such as Matchbox 20 and Fastball. I am probably going to purchase their other release ""Great Divide"" in the near future, since I have heard that it is excellent also. I will be looking forward to the next album!!"
4,My New Favorite CD!,"What a surprise! Got the disc for ""Closing Time"" expecting a one hit deal. My mistake and apologies to Semisonic! Dispite Peter's (Amazon.com) review, I think all of us ladies will love ""Completely Pleased""!! This CD is a treat for the ears and the mind."
5,Excellent Cd,"I love this cd. It's the first one I've listened to by Semisonic, and just great. I am especially addicted to the song ""Closing Time."" I recommend, at the risk of having it stuck in your head all day!!"
5,1. this cd is great,"This cd is a great mix of slow and med-fast songs that is great to listen to. I Wouldn't buy it if you won't give the other songs (not just closing time) a try. I really like Secret smile and the last song on the record. Basicly, I think it is worth it."
3,Creative but not!,"Semisonic has the same sound as a lot of the other teenybopper musicians, but they were more inventive with their single ""Closing Time"". It has a very unique tune to it. It is a song everyone loves at first but after first few times it tends to get annoying. Don't get me wrong I like it but in a month you won't see me listening to it on the radio. Most likely I'll change the radio to the next song that will have that same exact sound."
5,Semisonic - No longer alternative music's best kept secret,"I first fell in love with Semisonic after hearing their very first single, ""Down in Flames,"" off their 1996 release, Great Divide. The newest release from the Minneapolis trio has given me no reason to stop thinking that they are one of the best musical groups around. What makes Semisonic so special is this: there's hardly a band around that can compete with their combination of originality, creativity and all-around quirkiness that shines through in their wonderfully catchy songs. With the release of ""Closing Time,"" Semisonic is no longer a secret to listeners of Top 40 radio, and many have gone out in droves to buy the CD for that single song. Such unabashed consumerism usually spells doom for new acts, because it's hard to live up to early hits. But if there is any band with the style and substance to continue to be regarded as fresh and provactive after their breakthrough hit, it is Semisonic."
4,"Very good CD. Other songs as great as ""Closing Time""","Like many people I bought this CD, just to listen to my fav song of the week ""Closing Time"", but as I found, the other songs are great too. They are a bit more mellow, so if that isn't what you are looking for beware. The words are sweet and wonderful and the singers voice is familar, yet new. I recommend this CD, but it's nothing to rave about! E-mail me with what you think!"
1,Brit Band?,"I noticed a number of reviews from Scotland, England, and the other parts of the British Isle. Does that mean Semisonic is a British band? As a dumb American overhere I bought this album based on the song 'Closing Time'. I enjoyed 'Singin in My Sleep' also but afterwards felt disappointed in the album (which led to my rule of not buying a CD unless it has at least three radiosongs I like). I can appreciate the unique sound and understand how others may like it, but it's just not my style.Of note: 'Closing Time' and 'Singing in My Sleep'"
4,ITS JUST GOOD,Bought this on the strength of secret smile and I wasn't disappointed. Its a great blend of upbeat and more downbeat stuff. Its just good okay? What more can I say. You WILL like it.
5,Very good compact Disc,This is a very good cd . People who say it is stupid must have them selfs locked up some place where the wont be a danger to other people. My favorite song is DND and gone to the movies. I read other people comments on those songs saying how bad they are. they are crazy and stupid very very stupid stupid stupid People who dont likee this cd.
2,THIS CD AIN'T WHATS ITS CRACKED UP TA BE!!!!!!!,"hey, I just bought this cd, but because I had listened to ""Singin' in my sleep"" and ""closing time"", and, well, hey, they both are awesome, right? But the rest of the CD SUCKS!!!! Talk about ""DND""?? WHAt a PIECE of GARBAGE!! (not you, Shirley Manson.) CAlifornia is ok, a little boring at times but ok. SOme of the lyrics blow, and the guitar work is crap compared to Dave Matthews. Hey, just get the two singles instead!!"
3,Not as good as Great Divide,"FSF sounds a little as if Semisonic has fallen under the spell of the boy bands--the songs are a little sweeter than Great Divide, but not as inventive or well-crafted, and the production isn't nearly as brilliant as on the prior album. Disappointing."
2,Feeling Strangely Bored,"Semisonic sounds like Ben Folds twin brother. If you enjoyed the cloying single `Closing Time' then by all means buy it, otherwise run for the hills."
2,can u say one hit wonder(s)?,Closing Time must be a song about their carrers. Were they that bad to fade away after their first mediocore(?) hit?
1,Stupid,"Stupid lyrics, stupid, stupid, stupid. Avoid this at all costs unless you are stupid, stupid, stupid."
3,Waste of money,"I bought this because I liked ""Closing Time"" that and a couple others were the only good songs on the CD. I hardly ever listen to it anymore."
4,"Feelings, nothing more than feelings","I read about this album in the London Sunday Times records of the year section. I'd only heard one track from it when I got it. Wow! it was so good to hear a band on such great form, pure pop/rock, so melodic and lyrically sharp as a razor. I love the bittersweet texture of many of the songs, he sounds like me, unlucky in love! Great album for those bedsitters out there. Buy it!"
3,Could have been better.,"I think that some of the songs are cool. But some of them are boring. I like ""Feeling Strangly Fine"" a little. I recommend This album to people who wast there money on albums just for one or two songs such as ""Closing Time""."
3,Could have been better.,"I think that some of the songs are cool. But some of them are boring. I like this album a little. I recommend This album to people who wast there money on albums just for one or two songs such as ""Closing Time""."
4,Lots of top singles and other great songs!,"This CD is definitely worth buying. I bought it after hearing ""Secret Smile"" and ""Closing Time"", and as soon as I listened to the album I realised that Semisonic are not one of those bands who just has a couple of really good songs and the rest are almost identical. No, not at all! All of the songs are individual and special in their own way; I especially like the strings in ""Gone To The Movies"", and my favourite song of theirs, ""Singing in my Sleep"" is fantastic! This CD is really great because it doesn't attempt to be really ""deep and meaningful"" or ""dark"" in any way, it's just really open and uplifting! Dan Wilson's vocals are fabulous, and the lyrics and melodies are all catchy and fun! The only reason the CD doesn't get five stars is because a few of the songs in the middle aren't completely up to scratch, but they're good nevertheless. In fact, this CD inspired me to learn to play guitar! A must buy!"
5,"Semisonic's is anything but strange, and everything fine!","""Feeling Strangely Fine"" is an incredible album by a great band. Semisonic delivers a snappy cd with lots of addictive tunes, and radio hits. Who can forget the infectious ""Closing Time""? But this album is anything but a pop manufature. It is an album full of spunk, but character. The album spans a spectrum of musical styles, from the poppy ""Singing in my Sleep"", to the absolutely funky ""Never you Mind"" (God is that a great song! ) to the lilty road song anthem ""California"". There is even a song to fall asleep to ""She Spreads her Wings"". The songs are incredible, and there is practically something for everyone. But it's not just the music, but the lyrics. Semisonic just has this way of saying things, that you really have to sample first hand from the songs. So get ""Feeling Strangely Fine"", and I guarentee you'll be feeling just fine!"
4,"Great CD to listen to, to ease your mind.","This is a really good CD. I bought it for ""Closing Time"", just like so many other people, but by listening to the whole thing once I new I had a good ""whole CD"". All the songs are great. The lyrics are really ""out there."" And I like them."
1,"BAD bad BAD bad BAD bad BAD...what can i say, it was BAD!!!!","what a dissapointment!! I love the songs ""Closing Time"" and ""Singing in My Sleep"", but the rest of the cd is pure JUNK, did I say Junk?? YES. Bad written lyrics, with lame music that makes you feel depressed because it's so slow and BORING!! I bought this cd a while back and I've only played it one time! If you're looking for real music, check out the groups: ""Live"",or ""dcTalk"" I wrote reviews for both of those groups and they're both excellent!!"
4,from the ashes of Trip Shakespeare. . .,"'Bout seven years ago I saw a band called Trip Shakespeare in Champaign, IL - having never heard a note by them before the show, I left convinced that they were one of the most warm, passionate live bands I'd see in a long time. Bought all their CDs (the best of which, _Lulu_ and another whose title I don't remember right now, apparently aren't in print anymore, or at least not available on this site). Years and years later, Trip Shakespeare is gone, but at least two of its members have come back to us in Semisonic. God, I love the singer's sweet voice. He soars and swoops - Jeff Buckley fans: take note.This is a fine album, as was their previous _Across the Great Divide_, with more meat to it than just a great single or two."
2,Nothing But Closing Time,I don't have much to say about this album. Closing Time is the only good song. If you want a bettercd like this get Yourself Or Someone Like You by Matchbox 20 or Dizzy Up The Girl by the Goo Goo Dolls or any Third Eye Blind album.
2,two stars for two songs. exactly.,"the two songs that i refer to are 'closing time' and 'singing in my sleep', actually the reasons that i recieved this cd. the first is soo awesome still, after i have heard it soooo many times and soooo many radio stations have played it out and beat it to death. likewise for the second. the few songs that i can listen to many times over without breaking the cd.the reason that the other songs aren't that great...i have no idea. they just never hit that mysterious vein that would make me sing along with them.the only group that i can compare to these guys is actually matchbox 20. the only real difference between the two is the popularity factor. dan even has that same twang in his voice that makes rob thomas famous!if you don't like mb20, don't waste your money. if you do, go for it!"
3,"Pretty good, but not wonderful.","I originally bought this cd for the hit songs Closing Time and Singing in My Sleep. (who didn't?). Really, though, the other songs on the cd are just as good, if not better. Some songs are melancholy (Ie: Made To Last, Secret Smile), whereas there's the more upbeat ones like Never You Mind and This Will Be My Year. However, after listening to this song for a few weeks, I soon tired of it and now's it's collecting dust. Unless you really like this type of slow, pop-ish music and aren't into the heavier stuff like Bush, then you'd probably better spending your money on something else. So all in all, this is an ok cd. The lyrics get cheesy occasionally and some choruses repeat for who knows how long, but overall it isn't half bad."
1,NO WAY !,Hey dont listen to the other reviews ! If you are a 14-30 you will hate this albums ! don't buy it ! Im not sure if its worth one star ! It is boring ! Closing time is ok but now I heard it so many times that I cant stand it. Semisonic guys should retire they have absolutly no talent !
1,to much like matchbox 20,"no, i really do love that song ""closing time"", just because i have heard it so much, or maybe i was just enchanted by the way that the lead singer's voice sounds. well, i did read a review by a person from Australia just before i bought it, and it said if i liked matchbox 20 (which i don't) to buy this album. and i bought it anyway. so i am disappointed in these guys. because they actually do remind me of matchbox 20, with the lead singer having that twang in his voice so much like rob thomas. sorry, guys."
1,"""closing time"" is brutally bad.","I heard this song on the radio the other day and was stunned by its maggotry. Bad voice, hackneyed songwriting, every cliche you can think of...as Bill the Cat from Bloom County used to say...""Ack!"""
2,Just another 1-hit wonder...,"Face it...SemiSonic is just a one-hit wonder. Although I may have to eat my words in the future, the only good song on this album is Closing Time. I heard Secret Smile on the radio and thought by far it is one of the gayest songs I have ever heard. You'd be a complete fool to buy the album; if you must buy something, buy the Closing Time single. It'll save you a few bucks.q"
4,GROWS ON YOU! !,"OK, I've changed my mind about this cd. It rocks! ! If there's any time to buy this cd, buy it now, and hurry! !. I now like every song on it, eccept for California because of totally ""wacko"" lyrics. Buy this cd, and buy it now. I've changed my mind about it. It's great! !P.S. Some other great songs on it, besides This Will Be My Year, which is still my favorite, are Made To Last, DND,(very beautiful orchestrational music and electric guitar interlude) Closing Time, Never You Mind, and Singing In My Sleep. Please listen to them. I know how to play the guitar chords on the songs Made To Last and Closing Time, and they're great! ! I can also play the piano piece (very easy) for Made To Last, too. I like just about all of the songs on this cd. They're most all great! !"
2,This is alternative?,"This is alternative? Semisonic should be called ""Nonsonic""!!! Closing Time was a good song, but the only other good songs are ""Singing in my Sleep"" and ""California"". These other talented folks (John Munson and Jacob Slichter) shouldn't have to play with Mr. DND. (was that too weird a sentence?). Just this is no improvement from the Wallflowers. People: stick to MB20."
3,"Good promo song, but.....","The song used to promote this album, CLOSING TIME, was awesome. I loved the melodic undertones and lack of the typical mainstream-rock-screaming in this song. The rest is good, the music isn't hard on the ears and my mind relaxes when I'm hearing it, but I'd stick to the single of CLOSING TIME. That's something that I could hear over and over, without a chance of getting bored. Plus, when you have the single there's no skipping through other songs to get to it!"
5,"just like the music, picture, idea, how to love and live mix","good books always let you enjoy all your life. who do not want a beautiful around you? even sometimes the spirit of the book could make you defence the difficult situation of the life and refresh you when feel very tire and disappointed for what happened in your life. I just like it and will read it again and again to rich myself. thank you for reading my writing and hope this world become better and better with the help of good books, good poems like what Tagore did here."
2,Not an easy read,You'd probably need to be in the right frame of mind (and place) to pick up the messages from this tome.
2,No really what I was looking for,"I was looking more for practical tips on developing panto script.This book will tell you the derivation, but noit the how-to's"
3,"Not great, but usable","They slip, BUT, if you bend them back 180 AFTER they are tight, I do not think they will loosen.The Thermo Tec ones are far superior because they have ""holes"" that the teeth ""click"" into."
4,Mostly does the job...,"I'll say, right off the bat, that there aren't any instructions and I didn't look any up. I acknowledge that I may not have used them in the exact way they're meant to be used. I secured a wrap around my muffler using three straps put together. They don't exactly bite down with the strength of a velociraptor but they do cinch down a bit. you almost have to cinch them down and then fold the metal bands over to hold them in place. I haven't had any issues with them yet, so maybe they're doing the job I asked them to do just fine..."
2,OK,Ties are ok. I found that stainless safety wire did just as nice of a job for securing exhaust wrap
1,Does not fit,"I bought these to go around my exhaust pipe and hold the exhaust wrap on tightly, but they are so short that I ended up having to hook two together to make a connection around the pipe. I would have been better off simply buying another type of clamp."
3,just ok,I bought these ties to hold the exhaust wrap I installed on my motorcycle. I could not get the ties very tight. I tried everything to get them to really cinch down where they would not eventually slide or roll down. Being winter I have not had a chance to ride much to see how much they are going to move but it was difficult.
2,No directions-not great,"I bought these to do my exhaust wrap. The wrap went fine, but couldn't get the ties as snug as I wanted, and then the ties were tough to cut. Pulling hard with pliers the ties slip and rotate. Holding them in place with a screwdriver helped, but I still ended up using hose clamps in the end. Some directions in the package would have been nice. I still wonder if they needed to be crimped or why I wasn't able to get them tight."
3,"Not great, not bad",I bought these ties for an exhaust wrap job on my Harley. I can't say I'm impressed by their performance. I used one as a starter strap to hold down my exhaust wrap but when I was done I ended up using a hose clamp to fully secure the wrap in place. These ties are difficult to pull really tight so they spin easily on the wrap material. They look good but don't live up to their looks.
3,Overpriced but good quality,"The ties give header wrapping that professional look. After purchasing these, I found them at a local Harbor Freight store at a fraction of the price I paid."
5,Great ties,Exactly what I needed to tie down components in my engine bay where it gets very hot. Just be careful as they are sharp and can cut.
4,Fun- when it's put together,"First the positives-My little girl who is four really enjoys this toy. The Kerstie girl prances on her pony and jumps. She can put it together with help and I like that you can take it apart so that you can store it in a smaller space.The Negatives-I'm not sure that this is educational but it is fun. We have had no problem with it breaking. My one problem is that my daughter who is four and generally able to put toys together to make them work needs help putting this together. Once it's together though it does work. The one thing that I think is this toy gets boring very quickly because the pony only goes around in a circle.If you look for toys that are somewhat quiet, easy to play wtih, have more than a touch of a button to do something, and are durable, then you may enjoy this toy.Enjoy."
3,this toy....,"i don't have this toy, but my sister does. it's fine to put together, but, the girl dosen't stay on the horse very well. i think it's an okay toy."
2,its ok,"For some reason my 1 year old loves this, probably because he can make the horse jump. Otherwise its pretty mediocre."
5,Great Resource on Greek Modern History,"For anyone looking for a concise book on the history on Modern Greece then this is it. The book covers the period form just before the Greek revolution to moderns times. Clogg's style is easy to read and comprehend in all facets. The book is littered with great illutrstions, photos and maps which help the reader ""visualise"" what he/she is reading. The one thing I would say is a negative is that you need to have some knowledge of the events that are recorded in this book, but that is a minor issue in comparison to the whole work.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to study Greek Modern history."
4,A Concise History of Greece,"Richard Clogg provides a rich history in a concise fashion. Highly recommended to students of Greek history for its well documented and supported writing. Factual evidence and sources add to the history, even though concise. I can think of no better short history of Greece. It is a must read for anyone wishing to understand the trends that have molded the modern Greek state and the historical infuences on Greek national identity. Many have written histories of Greece, but few have delved into an anaylsis of the historical trends that have helped to create the Greek world view and national identity."
3,A brief but exciting history of Greek nation.,"It is well structured, brief and not boring. How could it be? It's about my country's history! It concludes all the history of Greece so anyone could be informed about the facts from 1770-2000.I like the way it presents the destruction of Smyrna and the exchange of populations.There are enough pictures and drawings as well. There are not enough about the recent history, but I was totally impressed when I saw at least few pages about the students occupation in Athens Polytechnic in 1973. I enjoyed it very much considering that in greek schools there is not even a little paragraph about this occupation.Finally, I think the tables at the last pages of the book are quite useful for anyone who wants to search more or compare to."
4,Pretty good.,"Very comfortable and soft. Good value. One item to note is that the material is a little thicker than I expected. Therefore, it can't be worn as comfortably with more fitted pants."
4,"Comfy, Affordable, But They Roll Up!","I was happy getting these in the mail, and I'm still happy I'm wearing them! However, perhaps it's just my fat unusual bottom, but these suckers like to roll down to your waist. If you have unusual hips like me, you'll understand where I'm coming from. There's not alot of things that are more annoying then walking out with family, and have your underwear rolling up, and needing to shove your hand down your pants in public to straighten it out. Don't get me started on the small length, nothing worse than a wedgie!Am I satisfied? Yes. Am I comfortable? No."
4,Comfortable. Quality commensurate with price.,"Ordered a pack, and pretty satisfied. If you are not too fussy, you'll find this product just fine. Obviously, they are not of excellent quality, but they are what we normally expect from our day-to-day clothes."
5,It's purely a platonic relation- really!,"I love these things. I've tried boxers that are woven cotton, but they don't stretch at the inseam and I lead a very active lifestyle (martial arts, cycling, etc) and I need some stretch. These things are as flexible as a cotton t-shirt (I think that's how they advertise them too).The ""comfort soft waistband"" I really don't care about. It's a nice touch I suppose.Basically these are inexpensive and very comfortable. I'm picky about the comfort of my underwear and shoes- I see no reason to deny it- and these are very comfortable boxers."
2,Waitband Rollover,The waistband in these was very narrow and rolled over making them uncomfortable after only a few hours wear - they went back.
5,Comfortable and Long Lasting,I was having a problem with my boxers wearing out to fast... I found these and my problem was solved. I am eventually going to switch out my whole inventory of boxers to this kind.
4,Great for everyday wear!,This boxers are really soft and confortable to be in all day. My only gripe is that they are longer than those i have.
2,Bad Waistband,"In my size, 40"" waist, the waistband rolls down while wearing these boxers. If you are super thin, this may work for you, but if you're overwight forget it."
4,So comfy,"I got these a few months ago, and they're still holding up fine. The waistband--which is way comfortable--is unstretched so far.They're soft, they feel awesome, they seem sturdy, and they're pretty inexpensive. One of my better purchases this year.Update (10/01/12): Almost a year later, they're still good. Definitely a good purchase."
5,Comfortable and light,Had always worn wighty-tightys but they became abrasive when worn. These have a very comfortable waist band and are very light. I live in a tropical climate so I appreciate the fabric being light in weight. The product was shipped rapidly and I am now a believer in boxers.
5,The Softest,My husband says these are the softest and most comfortable ever. They seem true to size and the covered waistband means no scratchy elastic.
4,SOFT!,It was very nice and soft. I love these i would love to order more. they dont come in the colors as shown above though.
3,soft,"The material is very light and soft, but the waistband is so light that it tends to roll. quite comfortable otherwise. A skinny person may not see it as a problem"
5,Great boxers,I bought this for my husband and he loves them this is the second set that I bought for him. They are strong and washes well.
4,Very Comfortable...But,"These boxers are very soft, comfortable, and fit extremely well...but the waist band ""rolls."" This keeps me from giving them a five-star rating."
5,These are the ones!,"I have a 29-year-old son who is incredibly picky as to his wardrobe. However, he requests these boxers every year for Xmas. I bought him some other brand last year and they had to be returned. Trust me, he has great taste and, as I said, is very attentive to what he likes and doesn't like. These, he says, ""Fit well and are very comfortable.""If I were you, I would go with these!"
3,Comfortsoft boxers,thought I was getting young mens boxers (youth) and when they came they were men's. Ended up keeping for my older son
2,"Comfortable, but not very tight waistband.","Don't get me wrong- these things are COMFY. However, when I wear them they feel like I'm wearing a pair of shorts. They're very big and the elastic is weak, so they do not like to stay up."
3,Not bad...,"...just not great. The plot jumped around a lot and was sometimes hard to follow. Also, everything was just wrapped up with almost no effort from the main characters. (I also thought it was strange how Amelia met Suni, almost randomly, and then Suni reappears and solves everything.)A good book to get lost in for a while, but not one I would read over and over."
3,You get what you pay for,"I picked this up to connect a keyboard and wireless mouse to two different laptops. Sometimes, flipping from one laptop to the next simply doesn't register and I'm forced to unplug the USB from one of the laptops and plug it back in. It's not constant and I only flip the switch once per day at maximum, so as long as it works most of the time I'm satisfied with that.Be sure you have a separate USB hub if you plan on connecting more than one USB device to this and then also have two USB cables on hand to connect each PC to the hub. You will need two of these (http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-Hi-Speed-USB-Cable-Feet/dp/B001MXLD4G/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1328465404&sr;=8-3)"
4,Cheap. Works. Don't forget the USB cables.,"This AB switch box is ugly and cheap looking, but it works. I'm able to easily use the same printer off two computers at work with just the push of a button - no having to unplug and plug cables. A light above the button indicates which computer is connected to the printer - there's enough room to P-Touch a short computer name above or below the button. There is a loud, cheap-sounding click when you push the button to switch computers. Including three 3-foot USB A to B cables ($3.99 through AmazonCables To Go 13171 USB 2.0 A Male to B Male Cable, White (3.2 Feet/1 Meter)) this was a simple $23 solution. Since this was an out-of-pocket purchase for my office at work I was only concerned about the price and function. Price was right and it functions well. Both computers print and scan without any issues."
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this about 3 months ago for connecting a keyboard and mouse to two different machines (both running Windows 7). At first, this worked great, but I started noticing issues whenever I connected or disconnected a new device. The target computer would fail to notice when a new device was attached (or tell me there was a USB installation error). Eventually, I was able to rule out any issues with my computers, devices or cables - which left the switch box. If you're going for a ""static"" setup (ie, you're not going to be attaching more than one USB device at time or changing that device once its set up) this switch box might fit your needs. Otherwise, I'd recommend going for something with higher quality."
4,Switch Box decreases decibels in office,"Switch Box has decreased the decibels in my office. My office mate no longer screams in frustration when I unplug her printer cord from her computer to mine. Now we just holler ""Switch"" when someone needs to use the printer. We're still loud.The switch box itself is lightweight and falls over, so I used a dab of museum putty to secure it to a shelf. The switch buttons have a good ""click"" feel to them, you know it's switched."
5,Time Saver,"Product was very easy to install and it works perfectly every time. I use it in an office, so it is constantly switching from one computer to another."
1,Junk,"I needed something to enable two computers (a Mac and a PC) in the same room to be able to share a printer sitting between them. I couldn't get the Mac to network with the PC, so I got this switch. It worked well and was very simple to hook up. The indicator light above the switch tells at a glance which computer is switched to the printer.3/21/12 update: About a month or so ago the unit started to malfunction. When the user presses a switch to select the alternate input, the previously selected input switch is supposed to pop-out, so that only one input of the two is active at any time. That doesn't happen and you have to fiddle with the switches to try to get the input you want selected. Bottom line, the switch has become useless after only a couple of months of very light use."
1,"Returned first, re-ordered, then returned again.","I had a problem with the top button ""1"". Button 2 worked fine, flipped the 2 USB outs cables around, button 2 still works (now on the other computer) and button 1 still doesn't, so I returned the order, and ordered again. I then got a new one with the same problem, sending it back, and just ordered a different USB 2 port switch. Noticed someone else had this same issue."
1,Headaches,"The ""B"" switch worked Great. The ""a"" switch did not work. It took the tech guy three hours to figure it out. I won't buy computer accessories these vendors again.PeteLittle Rock,Arkansas"
1,DIDN'T WORK,"The switch didn't work with computers that have access to a network. Our IT department spent hours trying to make it work and it ended up messing everything up. I did get a timely response from the seller on my first question which was ""Why isn't this working?"" but after trying their suggestion to no avail, I have not had any responses since to my questions. It is frustrating not being able to print at work"
1,Bad seller and Bad product!,"If you are looking for a USB Switch DO NOT BUY THIS ONE! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. They sell ""as is"", but if you really want to return it, there is a 25% restocking fee! Buyer be ware!"
5,Works like a charm!,"Have two computers, wanted to share a printer. Went to the Giant Electronic Store, the prices were out of sight, you would think I wanted to launch two rockets, so much hardware and instructions. Went on Amazon, ran across this plastic item 4 inches high 1-1/2 wide at a really low price. To make a long story short, ordered it, installed, and WOW, it worked like a charm, you won't be sorry."
5,My review of this product,"This item works exactly as described. I wanted a KVM switch but they are too expensive and my budget does not allow for that right now. I use this USB switch box to share USB devices between two computers. I have this switch connected to a usb hub with 7 ports and it works great when I have both computers on. I no longer have to plug and unplug USB devices. Just one push of the one of two switch buttons and presto, the USB devices are recognized by the other computer. This works great and it is not expensive. I highly recommend if you with to share USB devices between two PC's. Thanks Amazon."
2,It works...sometimes,"When it works, it does the trick, and the price is great.At first, it worked most of the time. Occasionally, one of the switches wouldn't ""take"". I'd have to click one switch then the other, back and forth a few times, or even disconnect and reconnect the USB cable to get it to work.That's been happening more and more often. It's just a few months old and at this point fails more often than it works. I'm going to buy a different brand this time."
5,Works great right out of the box.,"Excellent! Works flawlessly. Only thing bad about it is that since it's so light, it tips over when you connect the cables. Sits well on it's side though. Small & inexpensive. Overall an excellent buy."
3,O.K.,Short book. Pretty repetitive. Some chapters were put in separate categories but basically identical to others. I wasted time reading it but there is good info just a lot of the same info over and over.
2,Poor Writing Detracts from Good Content,"Although this book has been extremely helpful for me and my BC, I cannot ignore the lack of writing skills throughout. I feel safe in assuming that manuals such as these are usually not scrutinized for their mastery of English grammar and word usage, but this book is also structurally poor. I would suggest a different book without seeing any of them."
5,Simple,These were direct factory replacements for my '02 Z-71. They were a breeze to install. Now if removing the old ones were as easy...
5,One of the most powerful works of music in all spectrums!!!,The first timeI ever heard this album moved me in in every sense of the meanings and daily stuggles of life in general. Though Christian it is powerful in all aspects and moving with great metaphoric truths of life. Packed with both the powerful vocals of Russ Taff and the genre of the rock of that era this CD is still one of my all time favorites and even today I find myself ordering my 7th copy.
1,Don't waste your time and money!,I hate this DVD! It's nothing like the classic cartoons. My kids love Ton & JHerry and they won't have anything to do with this. They aren't even old enough to really appreciate the difference between the classic cartoons and the more modern versions. It's ludicrous that they even tried to pull this off. I hate it!
4,Power Pop/Rock at its best.,"This band sounds like...yes they are very original, but I want to give you the gist...U2's Bono singing with REM as the backing band. This CD also includes a very good, bonus live album. About 1/2 of the studio songs were re-recorded from earlier singles. Unfortunately, the original versions were much better. Also, the mixing is absolutely horrible in regards to the redone, original singles. The sound quality is another issue - a lot of hiss. However, the bonus live part of the CD is very good quality. This is the 1st studio album by this band. The music will not bore you (very upbeat); however, the best starter album is Stuck Together With God's Glue (all around perfect CD-1990) or The Best of Something Happens which is even better if you're looking to glimpse the entire career spectrum."
1,Bang your head on the wall...,"The opennings for the wire are too small for anything but 18 awg wire. Although it says that 14 awg wire will fit, I would like to see the designer manage to do it without wadding it inside. I'm stuck with an expensive worthless switch."
3,music madness,"this album was ashland's self-titled and after listening to so many of them, i can say that this one is one of the best. it has a great feel of classic rock, but is also kinda mellowed out. it's a good example of how rock started out to be and how it has evolutionized after so many years."
5,shine,"This oil will make your dogs coat shine. It has zinc and fish oil. The odor is not pleasant, but the dogs like it and it does make them look great."
5,This book was a true cowboy story of how it was done.,"This book was amazing. The detail on how things were done in those days was amazing. I could not skip one word in this step by step account of Ike's life. He was an amazing cowboy and the drawings that are in this book are truly wonderful and add so much to an already terriffic book. This book is made for a the cowboy and is the best re-ride story I have ""heard"" in many years."
3,Interesting but ultimately disappointing.,"Let's be clear, Bobby is a genius. His efforts on this this CD however are not up to his true talents. I have enjoyed some of his more inspired work with Yo-Yo Ma or The Vienna Philharmonic more than some of the well-meaning but trite work of this CD."
4,Attractive,"Attractive, sturdy, simplistic lamp. There is no halo; the shade sits on the socket and is prevented from falling off by the light bulb.Because the lamp base is fairly small, substituting the included shade for one of a smaller diameter still looks proportionate and makes for a nice bedside lamp.Note: The shade isn't true white.Unless the cost of shipping has been reduced since I purchased this lamp, I'd look for something similar to this in the store. Shipping was ridiculous."
3,Air Classics,"Air Classics appeals to those who like vintage WWII aircraft, although other classic aircraft are also covered. The talented Michael O'Leary seems to write and photograph the keystone articles each month, with other writes and photographers contributing. Unfortunately, for many years, this magazine's format has leaned towards larger, less tightly packed print, and more advertisements than meat. I personally had read and collected every single issue since Vol. 1, #1, printed in 1964, and gave the entire collection away to a local aviation museum a few years ago after letting my subscription expire, and haven't read Air Classics since. There are far superior, similarly themed aviation magazines out there to spend your money on, FlyPast and Aeroplane monthly being the two I'd recommend."
3,Air Classics Magazine Good and Bad,"I agree with the earlier review that there are many better vintage aviation magazines out there. The two mentioned (FlyPast and Aeroplane Monthly) have less usefulness in the U.S. though, because of their primary U.K. and European focus. Air Classics is a good snapshot review of vintage/warbird flying in this country, and its extensive treatment of Post World War II subjects is refreshing with all the emphasis on WWII in other warbird venues. Michael O'Leary does seem talented, but the Magazine suffers from his name being too frequently seen in the articles. Also in the latest issue (Nov. 2006, I think?), O'Leary really goes over the top in criticizing ""internet crowd"" armchair critics of the ""Thunder Over Michigan"" air show in August 2006. O'Leary using some non-professional vulgar language in the article that speaks very poorly for the magazine. I hope this is an abberation.JWC - Northern Virginia"
2,limited in many ways,"The title is more eye-opening than the work. Here are short works from around the world featuring men who are ambivalent about being gay, loving up other dudes, or being a part of a supposed gay community. The Boys' Shorts series is much better than this. This features international short, but their are gay foreign films better than this. For example, Spain's ""Bear Cub"" was far superior to the Spanish offering here. Maybe these works are a challenge to essentialism. Nevertheless, you may be severely disappointed after watching these works."
4,"Great stroies, I will cherish this book on my book shelf.","Great groups of stories with many morals.This book also sparks imagination and your own thoughts on life. From a few of the stories, I have already connected and can see myself in the stories, rooting for the underdog type of stories are my favorite."
2,Rotten Selections for the Most Part,"Chabon is much over-rated and he shows it with his taste for this selection. Always selected Alice Munro (yawn), the idiotic Cory Doctorow (must be a ""friend"" of Chabon), and several others ruins otherwise good choices of Perrotta, Lehane, McGuane, and Jones."
4,Good Collection...,"Michael Chabon's excellent introduction alone makes this book worth its price. Once again he basically asks, ""What's wrong with actually ENJOYING a story?"" As if the only stories worthwhile - those considered ""literary fiction"" - must be so abstract and esoteric that the only pleasure in reading them comes from a smug sense of accomplishment merely for getting through them.However, this isn't Chabon's best of all time - they are the best of the year. I found the results a bit hit-and-miss, but fortunately there were more hits than misses."
1,Criminal intent,"First, let me say that I have not seen this DVD, so my remarks are basically about WHY from the available information.I was a BIG fan of this show many years ago, and I agree with the other reviewers that it desperately deserves DVD treatment. But GET REAL, people. If the episodes are not complete -- INCLUDING the commercials that at that time were as much part of the plot as the rest of the action -- then to buy the collection would send TOTALLY the wrong message to the disk's producers. RESPECT THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR CUSTOMERS. Don't dangle a carrot for us and then hit us with this kind of brick. That's almost as bad as redubbing the music on WKRP in Cincinnati. Oh. Sorry. They did that tooI anxiously await a time when I can get the full episodes."
1,Wrong Episodes,"I ordered the Make Room for Daddy DVD since the picture of the case showed that it contained some of my favorite episodes, which I haven't seen in over forty years. One of them is Terry Takes Charge. Upon receiving the DVD, I anxiously opened it, and even though the case looked just like the one in the picture, it had totally different episodes, all of which I already have. So I returned it to Amazon with an explanation that they sent me the wrong DVD. So they sent me a replacement copy, which also had the same wrong episodes. I returned it again and was told that they were unable to replace it again. They sent me a refund instead. Why does the picture in Amazon's listing show the episodes I want, but the one that is sent out contains different ones? Otherwise, the case has the exact same picture as the one in Amazon's listing. I was really disappointed."
2,Miss leading reviews,"This Make Room for Daddy has only three episodes. Not four, not 10, onlythree. The other reviews are very miss leading and must have been appliedto this DVD by mistake. I would not have paid the asking price for threeepisodes. The first review offered states that there are actually 10 episodes.How disappointing. Only three. I must be expecting too much from others."
4,Unexpected Gem,"I love classic TV Shows and I knew a little about Danny Thomas and how funny he was. I don't recall that I had ever seen anything other than clips of Make Room for Daddy but I decided to take a chance when I saw the DVD release for Season 5. I loved it. Danny Thomas is so funny and likeable. The actors who played the children were all excellent - especially Rusty! The kids were funny without being annoying as so many kids are on todays shows. The show was very well written. There were famous guest stars, but Danny Thomas was the star and if you haven't seen much of Danny Thomas, please check out this DVD. If you like classic comedy you won't be sorry for buying Make Room for Daddy."
2,Make Room For Daddy,"I thought I was getting the first Season, but there were only 4 episodes on the DVD.."
2,Not as pleased,"I would have been a little more pleased if the price tag of $1.00 had not been on this dvd...I paid much more for it. Kind of a rip off. If it wasn't for the fact my Mentally Handicapped Brother specifically asked for this dvd, I would have sent it back. Lesson learned."
5,"Light, funny and very enjoyable","I purchased this item to get the pilot show for the ""Andy Griffith Show"" which was a spin off of Danny Thomas's productions. Afer watching the pilot show I watched the rest of the DVD and was hooked on the clean fun. If youlike 60's shows this one is worth having."
5,Danny Thomas on DVD 5th season,This is a great product and I would like to see them put all the Make Room for Daddy episodes on DVD. It would great to see excellent television again and pass good shows on to the next generation. The entire 11 years of this show would be great to have and I am sure many people would buy it. Thank you: N Anand
1,NOT Complete Episodes!,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this DVD set, and was very disappointed when I finally bought and watched it. This set gives us syndicated versions of ""Make Room For Daddy"" episodes which are VERY heavily edited! Many times the edits are abrupt fade out/fade ins, and the missing portions of the episodes make some of the stories difficult or confusing to follow. Putting edited syndicated versions of these ""Make Room For Daddy"" episodes on DVD is unforgivable and certainly not worth the money for this DVD set!"
1,"Questar gets an ""F""","I anxiously awaited the release of this set. How disappointing to find that, like Questar's release of ""The Joey Bishop Show"", this set truncates the opening credits from each episode. Sorry, Questar....the shows should be in their entirety.Fortunately, I read of this atrocity before purchasing this set. Until I find out that Questar has changed its ways, they will be added to my list of companies from which to NEVER buy."
2,This DVD Fails the Audience,"I love the Make room for Daddy show and I am glad that at least one DVD is available for the series. However, Questar did a horrible job of creating the DVD. There are NO chapters on the disc and therefore, if you have a multi-disc player, you cannot mark the spot on the disc to return to later. There is not even a ""Top"" menu.Like other reviewers, I noted that parts of the shows were cut (it is very obvious). When all is said and done though, it was Great seeing this old show again. To bad the producers of the video did such a poor job!"
1,I like this show too!,"I, like another reviewer, have not purchased this set. I feel that it's pointless to do so if the versions are syndicated. I think this is a deplorable (wreched) practice. This was a fantastic show and deserves far better than that!!! I certainly hope that this doesn't become a trend, although I fear that it will if they see people will buy them. I'll have to keep watching my already hacked for commercial's sake versions that I taped from Nick at Nite back in '88 and '89. (Yes Jimmy B., Nick at Nite DID run them)"
3,DANNY THOMAS,I LIKE THIS SEASON OF DANNY THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW GOT STARTED FROM THIS SHOW. VERY GOOD
5,Classic Comedy At It's Best,If you love classic tv like i do then you will love make room for daddy starring the late great actor Danny Thomas and if you are also a big fan of lost in space then check out that cute girl Angela Cartwright yelp that's her the one that played as Penny Robinson. Buy it and have a great laugh as Danny Thomas sings and tickle's your funnybone with the antics that he goes through just to make room for daddy.Rondall
3,hot but be warned,"This book was really hot but be forwarned if you are not into menage this book does get into it, graphically. I'm just putting it out there because I was not warned."
1,not worth it at all.,"My daughter loves backyardigans so we bought her this game.It is the dumbest game I have ever had to endure. There is very little to no learning involved (MAYBE colors, thats a stretch), the game itself is stupid and lacks educational value. Other than the fact that it has her favorite characters on it, its pointless. I would love if this toy got ""lost"" in our toy closet. I would definitely NOT recommend to anyone."
4,Great!,"Lush, romantic music transports you to a balmy evening on the Costa del Sol. A must have for your instrumental collection."
5,Romantic music,"This CD was played by the DJ at a wedding reception I recently attended. It was wonderful dance music!! I asked the bride for the title, then ordered it when I got back home. My husband and I have played it often. Beautiful instrumental; a big change from the usual stuff we hear on a day to day basis. Try it; you'll like it!"
3,Hyperlinks don't work right,"This is a great book and icon such literature but there are a lot of notes that add a lot to the book but the hyperlink only links to the notes, not back to the text so you can get lost pretty easily."
4,"I laughed, I cried, and I predicted the ending more than 100 pages prior to the end of the book","Tara is nothing like Parker ever expected. With her reflective sunglasses, golden dread locks, and mysterious personality, who couldn't resist her? On the other hand, is Tara directly related to the mysterious illness affecting students at the private school? Suddenly everyone is drinking a ton of milk, lethargic, and having cravings for... weird things. By the time Parker realizes whats happening, he's already in too deep...Even though I predicted the ending on page 43, I still read the rest because the writing was very good. Once I started the book, I literally couldn't put it down. I finished it in about an a hour. The characters were thoughtful and (except for Tara) realistic.On the other hand, the ending WAS a bit predictable. I think the author left in one too many hints. The ending was extremely depressing (for me).Overall, I loved the book while I was reading it, but afterward, I wasn't so sure..."
3,Interesting,"This is Goldilocks meets Medusa, and that combination is definitely something a bit different and unexpected. It would take a mind like Shusterman to come up with it, and it's mostly well-executed. There are some plot and logic holes in it (For instance, if Tara is always moving around, how has she managed to get all her statues to every new place without them breaking? And for that matter, why keep them at all?) but those can be forgiven if not overlooked. Overall, I enjoyed the read and liked the ending despite the unlikely and late introduction of a third party into what should have been a showdown between the main two characters. It's a quick read, and it entertains and it made me want to check out the other ""Dark Fusuion"" titles, so it succeeded."
2,:-/,"I'm huge fan of Lucias ! Loved ride the wind ,ghost warrior ,but she lost me on this one, couldn't get into the characters and the story line was boring ....I'll stick to her books on American Indians."
3,Another dissenting opinion,"As much as I enjoyed the scenery and the skillful prose that immersed me in the environment of this story, the plot was a bit too simple; quite frankly, the entire story was more like the plot of a well written video game. Young hero(ine) battles wave after wave of enemy while traveling a tortuous path.The book just sort of peters out. After 99% of the book is a travel along a road in one direction, to have a ""then we went back the other way and got the bad guy"" take 1% of the story was a total letdown.I was able to believe the environment, but not Cat. A mostly entertaining read, nonetheless."
2,Another Dissenting View: Lightweight derivative romp,"Whether or not you enjoy Tokaido Road depends largely upon your aim in reading it. If you're looking for nuanced characters, a well developed plot, or deeper insights into the realities of the actual Tokaido Road, this is not the book for you. It's most decidedly a work of romantic historical fiction, with plenty of gratuitious erotic elements thrown in to spice things up.The characters are stock figures, with little development, and the melodrama is tedious. Yes, the extensive historical research is apparent. But interestingly, I ordered Oliver Statler's Japanese Inn, at the same time as this novel, and read it immediately afterwards. The author appears to have borrowed heavily from Statler's account- so much so, that it seems at times that she simply incorporated entire incidents from Statler's book into her own. If you're really interested in Tokugawa history/art/culture, skip this one and buy a copy of Statler's wonderful and humorous work."
5,A Walk Through Feudal Japan,"All the research that Lucia St. Clair Robson has done for this book pays huge dividends for her readers. The journey down ""Tokaido Road"" is a page-turning adventure, a good read; but the real thrill is that the author pulls the reader into feudal Japan in an unforgetable historical experience.I was so taken with the novel that I followed up by looking for other things written by Lucia St. Clair Robson and came across ""Ride the Wind,"" the story of Cynthia Ann Parker, a woman raised by a Comanche tribe. It was another incredible culture experience. I learned more about Plains Indian culture in ""Ride the Wind"" than in all my other combined experiences about Indians.While I read ""Tokaido Road"" several years ago, my memories of it are still crystal clear, a sure sign that this is one of the best books I've ever read."
4,A Slice of Feudal Japan,"This most excellent novel enraptures the reader with its detailed backdrop and adventure story. The descriptions are poetic, and the characters themselves use haiku and other Japanese poetic forms to speak volumes of subtext. If you enjoy this book, look at the woodcuttings of the Tokaido by Hiroshige. Some of these woodcuts could be illustrations for the book."
3,Not worth the price,"I recently purchased this item as a gift for a relative who loves souvenirs. When I looked at the pictures I was sceptic about the quality but hoped for the best. Unfortunately, my fears were realized when the item arrived. The quality of the product is very cheap. It is cheaply made, lacks details, and a gold dust like substance kept coating my fingers when I held it (not sure if it is the paint peeling off). It is made of plastic which is quite brittle -- it slipped my hand and broke within the first day of receiving it. This makes it hard to ship it without avoiding breakage. I suggest to look elsewhere if you want a well-made, quality item, although, you will be surprised at how few sellers are out there with stuff similar to this."
2,Cheap and ugly,"I guess this one is for people with intentions to paint it afterwards.Someone asked me to bring a statue of liberty back from the US with me.Once I received it, I fell too ashamed of it to be able to offer it as a real gift.One could say you get what you pay for, I am not sure for this one. It still feels expensive for the price I paid.It is made of some kind of resin."
1,Bad bulb?,"Don""t like to give bad reviews, but this bulb did not work. HOWEVER, Since I have only one lamp this will fit, I have no way of knowing whether the bulb is defective or the lamp; considering postage and the trouble, I would hesitate sending it back even though its a very expensive bulb. On the other hand, I can't buy one locally, and don't think it's feasible to order another just to test."
2,Replacement Bulb,"Unfortunately, I had to return the product, which did not fit in its mountable part. Due to the fact that original bulb was broken and thrown away, I could not retrieve the original model and went just by wattage and type. That was not enough, because of variaty of mounting part design, in my case replacement bulb was not mountable and had to be returned. Return process was seamless and hassle free."
4,List of contents,"1.Single Edit 3:34, 2.Piano Version 3:55, 3.Ambient Remix 5:00, 4.Lilith's Revenge Remix 3:22, 5.Ocean 4:09"
5,Older than you think,"I enjoyed this book the first time it came out, too...not to mention that this book was originally published in 1970."
5,this book is amazing,very poor look and feel but has a warmth in his writtings that feel ancient as almost a biblical feel.
2,Misleading,"Unless you carefully read the cover art, you'll be surprised to learn that Tristano doesn't even appear on a majority of the album's cuts. I enjoy Marsh's playing but I don't appreciate this type of manipulation. Amazon should pull this album and Capital needs to repackage this. And whatever happened to the Charlie Parker/Tristano sessions anyway ?"
4,Such a Talent,"I like the way she approaches her piano playing. Most jazz I don't like it can get too loosey goosey and it just doesn't seem to have a direction. This is pleasant to listen too. I probably shouldn't compare, but I enjoyed Dianna Krall's playing, but I think Eliane takes it to another level. Not that Krall doesn't have a great band and her own unique skill. I look forward to investigating this CD in the future. So far such CD's as Plays Jobin, Sings Jobin and Kissed by Nature are excellent."
5,Taoism that fits!,"I found this book to be engaging, humorous and informative. I just picked it up one wet afternoon and couldn't put it down. This is the first book that I read by the Barefoot Doctor and it related Taoism to my world in a way that other texts couldn't, while making me look at life in a new and positive way. You can read it straight through from cover to cover or dip in at random according to your mood. I have read it many times and just keep getting more from it. Once you've read this one, you'll want to read more - good thing he's just written his 5th book - Liberation."
1,Barefoot Doctor's Guide to the Tao is Bare,"A very superficial guide to the Tao, this book is for those who are too lazy and unwilling to spend more than a few minutes to discover Tao. A quick fix that wears off quickly, this book definitely is not for those who wish to become 'one with Tao'."
1,Thinned-down Taoism,"I thought this book was a watered-down, hipped-up version of Taoism, aimed mainly at the gen-Xers. A true follower of Tao would not advocate the use of illicit drugs, as mentioned in this book."
5,"If I could give 6 stars, I would","AWESOME GAME! It's so much fun to play with 2 people or more. We gave this as a Christmas gift to newly weds and they love it. They're going to bring it with them when they visit, it's that much fun. Plan to buy one for myself soon."
3,Purchased But Haven't Played,I purchased this item but have yet to have the time to play the game. Dealing with the Seller was great - fast service. But can't really review the game itself.
4,Lead the Good Life ... In Spite Of ...,"Another trove of wisdom from Rabbi Kushner. No life changing break through, but assurance that leading a good life is the only way to lead life. A good CD for driving"
5,TIMELY....,"It's almost eerie that this book appeared September 2001, just as Americans are reeling with shock after senseless terrorist attacks killed thousands of civilians. Rabbi Kushner's books have comforted me in the past, and I was glad to see this new one published just when we need it. Kushner writes with insight about the inner human struggle between what we know is right or good and the self-serving impulses that tempt us. He writes about the desire for revenge and the morality of justice and forgiveness. The author quotes from various religious texts as well as world literature, mythology, and history to explore themes of the conscience. He manages to articulate moral issues with remarkable insight and wisdom, and without being teachy-preachy. The book deals with weighty issues but is a breeze to read. I recommend it to anyone struggling to understand his/her own conscience and those of other humans."
1,ouch... not so good,"I loved Kuschner's first book. It was writen through him, not by him. I was so excited to see he'd written another book. This book was written through ego. He was told he'd written a first great book and to teach us again. He wrote the book and it was more about how he sees religion as the answer. He ignored other processes of people. His first book really guided us to sort it out for ourselves. This book hit you over the head with religion. Sad, I'm religious, but don't want people scared away being hit over the head with it."
5,fantastic book,"a whole new perspective on life. many of the stories of other booksare repeated, but many new anecdotesin many placces you have to re read to really get it. very deep thoughts."
1,I can't believe...,"Read a book by Harold Kushner yesterday - ""Living a Life that Matters"". What an exceptional piece of ... ""literature""! In one chapter he discusses Hitler as an absolute evil. In another chapter he is having a tea with a priest who raped a girl saying ""you are just a human, that's natural and understandable""."
2,"Disappointed in the conclusion, tired of the technique :-(","This book began by raising some very interesting questions about ""mother love"" versus ""father love"", that is, about the need for a person to experience both unconditional love and earned love. I eagerly bought the book, logically believing these provocative questions would be answered at the end of the book, but IMHO Kushner wimps out. He writes that there really isn't any difference at all, despite the fact that he outlined significant differences earlier in the book.I won't be buying Kushner's latest book, which was released earlier this month (although I'll probably read parts of it in a bookstore). I find myself growing a bit tired of his technique of profiling one Old Testament character per book. (He's profiled Job, the writer of Ecclesiastes/King Solomon, Jacob/Israel in this book, and Moses in his latest.) Kushner writes really well, and I'd like to see him break out of this mold and deliver some truly original ideas!"
5,Rabbi Kushner is Wonderful: As Usual,"I became a fan of Rabbi Kushner when I read his book ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People"". When ""Living a Life That Matters"" was published, he came to Denver to promote the book at the Tattered Cover Book Store. How could I miss a chance to meet him? I was number 6 in line for his autograph and as thrilled as some groupie getting to meet her favorite rock star.Rabbi Kushner's works are a joy to read even when he writes of sadness and grief. He doesn't pretend to have answers but his gifts of words and empathy are comforting. He's a genuinely nice person with a wonderful sense of humor.That's not a book review. That's an author review. Which pretty much sums up the book."
4,GREAT,"one of the best techno cd's ever from a great belgian group.(buy also other cd's of belgian bands like dEUS, zita swoon,lords of acid) if u like praga khan buy all their cd's"
5,Praga's creative talent shines again!,"Praga Khan (ie. Maurice Engelgen from Lords of Acid) write music that is high energy, danceable, but yet it's not even close to sounding like anyone else.This CD has great acid sounds, catchy drum beats, and very sexy lyrics! Adult Entertainment is definately my favorite song. If you like Injected with the Poison or if you are a Prodigy type then pick up this CD! It's much more personal than the other stuff from Lords of Acid and there is virtually no vocals coming from Jade 4 U, but it allows Praga to really shine through even more!At first I wondered how someone who just released a full length album 1 year ago could possibly have another album ready..but to my amazement it's here and it kicks butt!"
5,Praga at his Best!!!,"This CD is simply great. All the songs on it are AWESOME, but the best part is the bonus CD. It has some of the best remixes. Some of which are not on other released CD's!! You just need to buy this CD. The 1-2 weeks is not a long wait for such a great cd"
5,leon keep singing,"Leon we love you here in Barnesville, Georgia. Please keep singing for Jesus. We like your album ."
5,"Essential for businesses, or just good enjoyable reading!","With a book written by an award-winning advertising writer, there is never a dull moment in the reading experience. At times I found myself chuckling out loud at what Luke Sullivan had to say. He makes sure to address different aspects of the advertising industry from television and radio to print and billboards. Sullivan provides a realistic view of the advertising industry by including both the positive points of advertising and the negative aspects of the industry. Sullivan provides many examples that clearly illustrate his points. The information is extremely useful and easily understandable. The book reads smoothly and I found myself breezing through the chapters. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in marketing, advertising or anyone who simply wants to know the process of making commercials."
3,Entertaining but short-sighted,"This book is a helpful and funny, if amazingly short-sighted, look at the world of advertising.For all of the defensive, indignant ad-folks who are perplexed by the criticism of the biz on this page: Advertising, both Whipple-style and Nike-style, encourages desire and over-consumption. And over-consumption creates, well, take a look at the world.Not YOUR world, THE world.It's hard to argue that our consumer society has been good for anybody but a small minority.For another adman's view on this topic, check out IN THE ABSENCE OF THE SACRED by J. Mander. He was the partner of the legendary copywriter Howard Gossage."
3,Potentially dangerous book for people who create advertising,"I thought the book was so-so and I disagree with about half of what the author states. The problem I have with this book is it focuses too much on creativity and image and not enough on generating sales and a return on investment for his clients. The purpose of advertising is to generate strong product interest and sales - not to win advertising awards for the ad agency because the ad is ""really creative"" but does little to grow a company's business."
5,Funny and Insightful,"This is one of, if not, the best book on writing great ads. I laughed, I cried. But I mostly laughed."
5,"Thanks, St.Luke!","have been a copywriter, oh, almost 9 years. have read, mmmm, at least 50 books on the subject and greased countless archives and ca's, and so on. how many classics in that bunch? ogilvy (dated, but so what?). ""the copy book,"" an absolute gem, get it asap. and last but not least, ""whipple."" as one copywriter to another, i'm not gonna put the sell on you, but i am gonna urge you to flip through it. five minutes or so with it in the hand should close the deal. ten minutes for slow readers. and now ... mr. lone voice of dissent whose comments appear below. ever run a business yourself? you should try sometime. and when you wake up one morning and realize sales are taking a dive, and your wife is packing the louis vitton's, what's the bet some 5-watt bulb will go on in that head of yours as a voice whispers, ""hey, why not run some ... ads?"" miserable sod."
4,not bad to get a summary on graphic techniques,"I liked that you can find a lot of examples and ideas for setting up graphic content on advertising works. For someone like me that has not been educated to graphic arts and communication techiquese, this book is a nice reading and you get out with several good examples and practical understanding."
3,Colloquialism Sprinkled with Wisdom,"I was told this book is the best out there for learning about copy editing. That may be. I have found the author offers real wisdom regarding the industry and some advice about actually creating, but I am annoyed at how colloquial the language is. It feels like the author is shooting-the-sh$t with the reader, a style which some people would like, but I feel is a waste of my time in the setting of the book."
3,C for effort,There are much better books out there on this subject.It was interesting in parts but it's usefulness was questionable.More opinions than facts with little in the way of proof of results.
5,It was much better than Cats. I'll read it again and again.,"I read Mr. Sullivan's book about how to create great ads, but I still suck. Don't hold that against Sullivan, though. He's written a masterful work of the business and his book will probably outsell mine. Nice work, hot shot."
5,The One Book Advertising Students Must Read,"One mark of a classic is that its lessons continue to apply regardless of the passage of time. A decade in advertising is like fifty years anywhere else, and yet Hey Whipple (written before interactive took off) remains invaluable. Someone could steal my Tipping Point and I'd be irritated, my Ogilvy on Advertising and I'd be disappointed, my Positioning and I'd be bummed, my AdCult USA and I'd be miffed--but if they stole Hey Whipple, I'd hunt them down with a blunt, heavy object."
1,The Truth,"A fallacious account of Macedonian history, most likely fueled by greek propaganda. Most literature on the history of Macedonia is manipulated by foreign parties with their own interests at hand. If you are interested in the history of Macedonia I encourage you to read materials from all sides, and speak to people. The truth is never easy to find. History can never be changed. Macedonia is its own land with its own people as mentioned in the Bible, ancient maps and other scripts."
1,ANSWER: THE HELLINES (GREEKS),"How much more someone has to think?Is that so difficult?I guess no.Simply, this ""book"" reveals the anger of the author for the glorious Hellenic history."
1,Greek Denial of the MACEDONIAN Name!,"The most important thing to remember about the ""Macedonian conflict"" is that the Greek position has changed dramatically over the past decade. Official Greek government policy was that Macedonia did not exist. When Greece took over Aegean Macedonia in 1913, they killed, tortured and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Macedonians. They changed the names of people, villages, and landmarks from Macedonian to Greek in their attempts to eradicate the Macedonian name. Two things to remember:1. It is ironic that Greeks now ""love Macedonia"" when they tried to eradicate its very existence.2. If Macedonia has always been Greek, why did the Greek government deny its existence until the 1980's?"

2,I was hoping for something more,"EH! some of the reviews seemed to suggest that there was more to this CD than the ""sings the blues"" sound-track...NOPE! Have to say I wish Diana would return those moments she stole from me. Waste of time!"
3,"Pretty, but Light","This song is one of those classics which is really well-constructed, and I want to like, but I just can't bring myself to give it any more than three stars because it feels just so... average. Truly, ""1 Thing"" is unremarkable, Amerie uses too much instrumentation, and her vocal track is infringed by this a few times.Amerie's voice also is lackluster in my view, and she essentially repeats the same (albeit catchy) line successively. Truly, this is a single which can be skipped."
3,1 thing is sure: it's a Hot track!,"I remember Amerie's debut was really a fine one: it was the kind of smooth and laidback grooves I just can't get enough. It was a lot more soulful than, say, Ashanti, even if critics tried to depict Amerie as just another of those ""urban pop"" trendy singers with nice faces but not a lot of talent.1 thing is sure: Amerie's ""1 Thing"" has nothing to be compared with her previous works. It's not smooth at all anymore, but instead it's a raw funky R&B; track. Possibly the best of the year in its category.A good song to nod your head to, which proves that Amerie is as at ease on floor-filler songs as on her usual down/midtempo material. It's really a good tune, especially the version without Eve. She has done what Beyoncé did 2 years ago with her banging ""Crazy In Love"", a track, which unlike most of ""so-called"" R&B; you can hear on the radios, is wildly funky!"
3,"good narrative, poor formating","I really enjoyed this book and Perry's story-telling, but the formatting for the Kindle was so terrible. There is random super and subscripting and the charts are unreadable. Whoever converted this title performed a rushed job. What a shame."
5,Forget Harry Porter,"This is one of the best children's book I've ever read. Most of the books written by the Scandinavian children's writers never make it to the US -- which is too bad. These books are very well-written they are not ""scary"" and have really sophisticated plots that make a child think."
2,"Dull and outdated translation, ugly edition","This book, beloved since childhood in Ukraine, has turned out to be a total disappointment. This English translation which I bought to read to my son is really dull and outdated. People don't speak this way in real life (e.g. ""Oh, lordy, lordy!"" was my ""favorite"" phrase). And why in the world was Bok (in the next, same low quality book ""Karlson flies again"") renamed Mrs. Crawley? The edition itself is very uninviting - scarce black and white drawings and thick grey supermarket book style pages. In a nutshell - a disappointment, but there are no other choices for this otherwise wonderful children's book."
3,"""To buy, or not to buy...""","This book will never be very popular in the US unless some brilliant translator breathes a new life into it. If you are from the former Soviet Union you will never be satisfied with this translation and your English-speaking children will never understand what's so special about this book. For those who do not know - this book by Astrid Lindgren has been wildly popular and still is in the former Soviet Union's territories. Mostly due to the excellent work of the translator, they say Astrid Lindgren herself thought that the ""Russian"" Karlson came out a ""better one"" than her own."
3,Imaginative but pedestrian,"I was underwhelmed by this book, as I have been by this author's other books. Karlson is a self-absorbed, obnoxious, dangerous adult who gets this innocent kid into all kinds of trouble, but where I hoped there would be something clever and redeeming about Karlson he instead remains a shallow and predictable prop in a story that basically goes nowhere. I found myself hoping it would end soon as I read it to my 5 year old, who enjoyed it. I find books like the Moomin series much more clever, engaging, and entertaining...and my 5 year old loves those too."
5,"Publishers, PLEASE make an English edition available!",This book is just too good to remain out-of-print.
5,Better then Harry Potter,"Its a shame that this book didnt become as famous as Harry Potter in the US. I loved reading it when i was a kid, and I would love to see this book to be put in circulation. Someday if i get rich, I would love to buy movie rights to this book. best children;s book ever"
5,this is great,"this is a great addition to the oh so wonderful polly pockey wild waves set (no exzaderation) everyone says the wild waves set is bad, but it really isnt, anyways, it works and its not bad made or anything."
5,I was on a log ride!!!!!!!!!!!!,I was on a log ride and it was fun a little scary but I love it. this toy looks fun if you like log rides?
4,Whoosh.....BANG!!!!!,This toy is cool because my Pollys can go on it and it's a log ride. I also like the car they ride in. But when they go down the car lands on the floor with a bang and tips over. Otherwise it's a pretty cool toy and a great addition to Polly World.
5,cool review,"cute dog, water park. what's not to love? dog fits in seat! stays together, real fun. my kitten pushed it down and he got splashed just like real log flumes! A+(...)"
1,Hard to put together...,"I bought this toy for my daughter, she loves Polly! However it is very difficult to put together and doesn't stay together. I took it back and got a new one and have the same problem. If it would stay together she would probably love it..."
2,Be Aware!,"The ISBN NO. below is the LAB MANUAL for the text advertised above. I think it is interesting and worth the time reading it, but it is not the theoretical treatment you may be interested in.ISBN-0-8273-7038-5"
5,"Sexy, laid-back album",This is one of my favorite laid-back albums. It's a great uniformly sexy and smooth disk that you can play for atmospheric background music for dinner or just chillin'.
4,very Good Book,i dig watching Gordon Ramsey. His shows are full of Knowledge and will seperate your funny bones from laughing so hard. this Book follows him through a whole lot of challenges over the years and it also showcases his driven will at doing what he does best. this Book is very detailed and a must read. the Man is a Hard worker and he covers so much territory.
4,Roasting in Hell's Kitchen,"Hell's Kitchen is one of my guilty TV pleasures and I love Gordon Ramsay. He wrote this book and he writes like he speaks--I loved it. The book details his childhood, his relationships, his start as a chef, his ups and downs--very good, quick read. Fan of his TV shows will not be disappointed.[...]"
4,An insight into a tough man,"I love Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, mostly for the way Chef Ramsay will give such unadulterated feedback. He doesn't sugar coat what doesn't work. But, after he has broken through the crap, he shows tremendous compassion in a real way.In his book, he tells his story, and you will see just what makes him tick. His broken childhood and family troubles that followed him into adulthood. His learning under some very harsh chefs in their own right. His drive to be among the top chef's in the world of serious cooking.I wouldn't say this book is great literature: he writes it as if he is telling you a story over a couple of pints. There is a good flow, but sometimes he tends to move about in the flow. This is not an in-depth look, but a man trying to let you know why he always appears to be in a bad mood.Overall: if you're a fan of his shows, it s worth the read."
4,Not what I expected it's a great read,"Loved this book about Gordon Ramsay, and it really gave great insight to who he really is!!!"
4,"Fast read, interesting story","Well, I read this book in about 2 1/2 days, which is quite unusual for me, as I'm not an avid book reader. I was intrigued to find out that Chef Ramsay's upbringing was far from perfect, and this pushed him to become successful. He does do a bit of bragging in the book, but working in the culinary industry is very difficult. It's high pressure and non-stop pretty much 7-days a week, so he's entitled. I enjoyed the fact that he was honest about his early business deals and how they were not successful, but he learned a lot from them and even though he did not succeed at first, he kept going. I would say if you're a fan of Chef Ramsay, then you'll enjoy this book."
5,Well written,"I found this book to be well written and entertaining. It gives a different perspective of Gordon Ramsay than what most people think. I found it hard to put down, I wanted to keep finding out more about his journey to become such an outstanding chef."
4,Honest from the Heart,"This is a very quick read from Gordon Ramsey. I think the media exaggerates and feeds preconceived ideas into people's minds about what this man is about. The book really hits some high notes about where Gordon Ramsey is coming from. When he appears on tv yelling and pissed off at someone, it is usually because he sees their potential and that is his way of bringing it out of the person. Surprisingly easy to read, the book gives insight on his past and just what makes him the man he is today. Definitely worth a read. I read through it pretty much through 2 sittings and found new respect for this man."
5,Humble Pie indeed,A great look into the life of Gordon Ramsay. Once you have read this book you will respect the man and understand why he comes across as intolerable in his various TV programmes.
5,Everyone thinks they know the real Gordon Ramsay...,"This book show you the real Gordon! His background, rise to fame & current life.The man is charming, witty, and loving. If you have ever watched any of his shows,this is a must read!"
5,"Best Seller, The book was like new, I would highly recomend",I recieved this bnook and was shocked at the condition. It looked as if it was new.The shipping was so fast I could not believe it. I have order things from the same state I live in and have not recieved items as fast as I have recieved this book.I would highly reccomend this seller and would buy from again without a second thought.JeannetteLoxahatchee Fla
3,Stick to Cooking,"I love Gordon Ramsay to death and watch all of his shows on Fox and BBC America. He may be one of the top chefs in the world, but when it comes to writing, he is no Anthony Bourdain. Ramsay tells his story in a no-holds-bar fashion, almost as if he was having a beer with the reader in a pub. The tone is very conversational, but the tales he tells could have benefitted from some ghost writing. I enjoyed the stories, but was hoping his writing would be as exquisite as his cooking."
3,"Good, but dissapointed",I thought the audio book was great....Only problem is the cd us abridged. It left me wanting more. Perhaps it's his way of getting me to read the book.
5,Honest voice,"This is quite a pageturner. My wife and I rarely finish the same book within the same day. We live an era of ghost written celebrity biographies written with boring pedantic voices. I have no illusions that Ramsay wrote this book without assistance (whether an editor or overzealous assistant)but the book certainly captures his voice. The result is an honest unapologetic narrative of the life of a remarkable man. There are lessons to be learned, hard work as the solution for overcoming adversity. Readers of food porn may be dissapointed in that the book is less about the food than the man behind the food. Fans of Ramsay will be delighted because of the insight into the method behind his madness."
5,A 'Real' Story - Gordon's own words,"I didn't know what to expect and boy I was NOT disappointed.This is exactly what I had been waiting for. Gordon's own words on his life.A true page turner, I read it straight through. What a poignant story this man has to tell. A MUST read if you are at all curious as to what makes this man tick.[Note: This book along with 'Gordon Ramsay - The Biography' allows the reader to learn why this man is so absolutely amazing]"
4,Local Area Networks,This book takes a very technical subject and approaches it with straight-forward easy to understand format. I think it will be a great addition to my classroom.
2,"lots of hits, but absolutely lifeless remaster","I have to agree with Withnail's earlier review in that this remaster is rather poor. He said it seemed ""lifeless"" and I wholeheartedly agree. It just sounds flat, uninvolving, dull, dead. I remember how fun and interesting these songs were when they came out. This CD, although it contains many of the popular hits, is so poorly recorded that I can't stand to listen to it. I guess I'll take it down to a used CD store and sell it and see if I can find the ""Flashback"" compilation that Withnail mentioned."
3,"Some Good Hits, but an Iffy Package","I would like to add along with the other reviewers' comments the following:The liner notes are spotty. While some might find Lynne's brief anecdotal essay fun, the CD booklet lacks information about release dates, original albums, chart positions, musicians, or the like.A person seeing ""Xanadu"" as one of the tracks needs to be aware that this disc features Jeff Lynne's lead vocal, not the Olivia Newton-John vocal one might expect from the film soundtrack."
3,Another one?,"This is the third hits collection put out by Legacy for ELO. The third time's a charm, right? Well, almost. I guess if I were a big fan of ELO, I'd grab 2000's 3CD Flashback collection. Granted in 2003, The Essential ELO was released with 15 songs, but this latest collection has 20. For some reason, some of the 'Essential' songs aren't the very best, because they have been omitted.All of that aside, getting 20 hits by one of the most progressive rock bands of the seventies ain't so bad. Some of the effects heavy numbers will make you chuckle due to their use of primitive electronic effects. All and all, this collection packs all you need to know about ELO. You'll be surprised at how many song you actually know too."
3,Missing key songs!!!,"There are already a bevy of ELO Best Of's in the marketplace, so it's a bit of a headscratcher as to why we're being treated to another one. Presumably because of the recent success of ""Mr. Blue Sky"" in various commercials and movies (thus it's appearance as the lead-off track of the package). While most of what's here is deserving (I guess...), I can't believe what's missing! First of all, no ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head""?!?!? I know it's very subjective, but it's one of, if not the, best record they ever made. And just recently featured on Fountains Of Wayne's new album. I guess at least they get what a great song it is... At any rate, do yourself a favor and find an ELO package that has ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"" on it at least!"
5,Great sampeling of ELO's big hits!,Great CD showcasing the very best songs of ELO! Brought back many grat memories of my youth in the 70s! Must have for the ELO fan or any music fan of classic 70s music.
4,A reprisal to relish,The quality of the remastering is very good. Most of their best material is covered- I suggest you review the contents to be sure what you want appears on this excellent blast from the past.
3,Fantastic CD,Got hooked on the music from the Honda commercial. Had to have it. Bought it here and love it. Electric Light Orchestra produces some very interesting and boppng tunes on this CD.
4,A GREAT ALBUM,"THIS IS AN ALBUM NAMED ""OUT OF THE BLUE."" IT'S A GREAT ALBUM. YOU MUST GET IT . IT'S FANTASTIC! ""STARLIGHT"" AND ""MR BLUE SKY"" ARE GREAT SONGS, AND ""SWEET TALKING WOMAN"" IS SUPER TOO. HEY WHAT ABOUT ""TURN TO STONE"" AND ""ITS OVER?"" THEY'RE AWESOME ALSO.I LIKE THE WEIRD SOUNDS AT THE BEGINNING OF ""STARLIGHT"" AND ""SUMMER AND LIGHTNING."" ALSO, ""STARLIGHT"" HAS A GREAT LINE THAT SAYS 'STARLIGHT, YOUR EYES ARE LOOKING DOWN ON ME.' ""JUNGLE"" IS ALSO A PRETTY GOOD SONG.SEE YOU SOON. BYEBYE."
1,"Not ""The Very Best"" of ELO at all...","This album contains only a selection (quite incomplete) of the most Radio-aired tunes of Electric Light Orchestra. Period.If you're looking for a more comprehensive ""Best Of..."" ELO music, get ready to spend more bucks and go for the 'Flashback' 4-CD box collection."
3,Rehash Of Existing Titles,"A nice compilation if this was a two disc set like ""Strange Magic"". I'll get it to keep my collection to date. As for the line-up of tracks, reviewers have said it all. Also, the import has the new ""Xanadu"" version(from box set) & have no idea if it is the same one on the U.S. version. For a new fan it would be a nice set. For the collector, just the same recycled tracks but missing some of their big hits.(...)"
4,Classic-al ELO Rocks,"Here we have a compilation of most of the best of ELO. My favorite ELO tune is 'Hold On Tight' but this whole album is truly great with the exception of'Ma-Ma-Ma Bell' which I would have gladly traded for 'Roll Over Beethoven'. However with a cd of 20 tunes and a really long set at that, this album is well worth the bucks. Here's your chance to hear some great talent most notably Jeff Lynne and the rest of the ELO group. Lots of sound effects thrown in plus the big band sound which sounds great but sometimes overshadows the vocals."
4,Pretty Good!,"This ELO compilation, for the most part, has many of their hits. There are a few songs that would have been nice to be here, but what is here is good. This may well be the best single disc compilation of theirs. I can't say much bad about it, really, it's really quite good and I would recommend it to the casual fan, in particular."
4,Feel the power and the spirit of E.L.O.!,"I love the Electric Light Orchestra! I have since I was a kid!This is a great and almost complete compilation. It's not perfect, mind you. In my opinion, there are several songs that suck; like ""Wild West Hero"", ""Xanadu"" and ""Rock 'N' Roll Is King"". And the two major FM classics, ""Fire On High"" and ""Do Ya"" are missing from the set.But I must confess to a disgustingly guilty pleasure; I love to crank up ""All Over The World"" as loud as possible and just let myself get sucked in! That song manages to put me in such a great mood every time. Must be the days-of-disco nostalgia left over in me."
5,Amazing!,"This CD is full of hits I had long forgotten about, if you liked/Like ELO, then this will be a new favorite!"
1,Not THE Best of ELO,"I never heard this CD, but for the money- where is ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"" With all of the over and over again re-issue packages, I would not consider this CD (Notice the price) without out this song- didn;t even bother to check out if any other major song was also missingGive me and the Music Lovers of ELO a break"
5,Great CD ...BUT....,This is a great CD and I love it. I ordered it awhile back and play it all the time. BUT I ordered another DVD from Moviemars ( who sent this cd) and guess what...they shipped me the same music CD I already got previously. They say I can return it if I do all this stuff and fill out this form and then go to the post office and mail it. ONCE they receive it back THEN they will ship me what I ordered in the first place. What a CROCK !! Won't be ordering from them again.
5,one of the best ever made!,"the soundtrack of my teens so im a lil biased,but that said you can play this from track one to the end w/o skipping a track! AWSOME cd!"
4,Pretty good compilation,This best of comp is missing some tunes but overall you can't argue with the songs. If you can manage to feel sad when listening to E.L.O. you're most likely dead.
5,Mood brightener,"For one, this artist has the most upbeat songs, especially Mr. Blue Sky.The album, while it doesn't have all of the best, has the large majority of my favorites too."
4,Great songs,What can I say. It's ELO. It's a very entertaining trip back in into the past when music was really great.
2,NOT the very best,"I'm all for truth in advertising. If we're talking ELO, and you want the VERY best, you just can't leave off Fire on High. Sure, most of the other biggies are on this collection, but let's face it--the record company is enticing you with the allure of definitive collection here, only to leave you thirsty for more. This looks like a page out of Yogurt's book from ""Spaceballs"": The Search for More Money."
4,What?! No 'Fire on High'?!,"I saw ELO back in the day when they performed inside the spaceship, lasers ablaze. They were amazing.When the concert was over and everyone exited in an exhausted state of musical delirium, I overheard one fan mention to his buddy, 'Dude - No Fire on High.' It hadn't occurred to me (in my stupor) but he was right. Leaving out Fire on High was, in retrospect, a disappointment. Therefore:A 'Best of ELO' compilation that leaves out Fire on High?!'OUTRAGE!!!', he sputtered."
1,Completely sucks,"It completely sucks. The software starts scanning and then gets stuck ""not responding"", when I finally got it to scan it never found any of the pictures I recently lost, I tried to use the ""recover"" feature but it was not responding after it finished scanning. A complete pain in the ass, lost my money, never got the pictures or files I wanted. It scans things you have been looking at in the computer, so if you were reading about a movie or looking at some clothes recently, that is what you will recover."
1,0 STARS HERE TOO,"WOW, I can't believe I didn't read the reviews before I opened the box.The only upside is I paid 19, not 35 dollars. Other than that.....its a waist of money....the other REVIEWERS nailed it right on the head, I have nothing new to say, just reinforcing their opinions."
1,System Mechanic Not worth any money,"Installed this on two PC's, lap & desk, doesn't work half the time on either. Program ""not responding"" is quickly becoming the most seen phrase on my systems.It also has conflicts with some previously installed programs, and no solution or workaround is suggested. Other programs must be uninstalled before running S&M; #7 or even leaving IT installed as is just as quick to pop-up a conflict with ... message.Other reviewers are right, I suspect tech support is only a dead letter box (file 13). No help here. It promptly automates a blanket response, then forgets about you. It does however manage to send you daily emails about how good this product is. Thou dost protest too much.On the up side, this product is bound to improve the much sullied reputation of car mechanics."
1,Iolo System Mechanic 7 and Search and Recover 4,"These are two unbelievably abominable products. Neither will install on my system, and the ongoing dialogue with their so-called tech support has done nothing to improve this situation. It is now mid-February 2007. My problems began in October, 2006 (Search and Recover) and December, 2006 (System Mechanic 7). During the time that iolo tech support strung me along, my 30 day return window closed behind me. Since last October, I have incurred hours worth of long distance charges (because iolo has no toll-free support number).Customer service stubbornly refuses to refund my money, and a certified letter to iolo's CEO, Noah Rowles has yet to generate a reply."
1,-DOES NOT WORK ....ZERO STARS-NOT EVEN 1!!!,"This is a USELESS 40$ purchase which doesn't even recognize the 7 photo files that ARE on my SD card, much less recover the ones I lost after I accidently changed the format. Getting my hopes up AGAIN with the promises of this program...... after a rare cruise with and rare photos of my dad who has now passed away."
3,"Interesting, but less so for the classroom","Informative and insightful, but my application was for middle school science ecology use. As the problems increase in span and complexity more time is needed for the presentation and explanation.The first program was easier to break up for classroom use. NG provided lesson plans to facilitate classroom use, for the first set of programs. Apparently the second set doesn't have the classroom support the first did.I enjoyed previewing the disk at home. Easy to understand for high school or college students with prior knowledge of chemistry and ecological concepts. I am not sure how to break it up into bite size chunks for science7 classroom discussion...yet"
3,Watch out: fit not true to size,"This was supposed to be my second pair of Dr. Martens. I was quite disappointed when they arrived, I ordered the same size (7 UK) of my previous pair for this pair and they turned out to be smaller!If you're ordering this model, look at the size conversion chart and go one size up of your actual size."
4,3 1/2 stars - Especially for fans of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!,"This DVD has two full length horror films on one side. The quality is not the best, but it is definitely watchable with no major audio or video problems. There is no scene access on the dvd.Eaten Alive is a fun and twisted low-budget horror that fans of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre will enjoy. Three of the original cast and crew take part in this movie, and as you watch, you will often be reminded of TCM. The soundtrack to this film is very similar to TCM, but still original.There is a fair amount of unnecessary dialogue and adding crocidiles to this storyline seems a bit gimmicky, besides, they look really fake. Expect a small amount of really well done gore effects.Overall Eaten Alive is a better than average horror flick that verges on being really creepy! 3 1/2 STARS"
3,"Pretty, but small","The description doesn't describe the size, these lanterns are small. They hold tea light candles. They are very, very pretty. The blue glass is iridescent and really a nice addition to my garden. The construction isn't the highest quality and getting candles in and out is a bit tricky."
4,Adorable and good value,I collect and hang candle lanterns on my patio and in my gardens. This is a nice little lantern for the price. You just twist the bottom and it comes off easily to replace the candle.
5,Ray is the one to read!,"Best Autobiography I ever read! Way more fun to read than a typical, ""I was born to a poor immigrant couple back in..."" bio. I read ""Kink"" and as much of a Kinks fan as I am, I couldn't wait for it to end. It was funny and interesting at times but I got sick of Dave Davies preachin' and ended up throwing the book across the room. I reluctantly read ""X-Ray"" while babysitting my little cousins. I was afraid it was going to be like his brother's and was quickly shocked and pleased by what I read. I thank the insane Kinks fan at Borders who wouldn't let me leave until I ordered it."
3,Now I know why it's an 'Unauthorized Autobiography',"This autobiography isn't bad, as far as these things go. Ray covers many of the big events from the birth of the Kinks to the early 70's, but he overlooks many others. He also writes about his life and career in a strangely detatched manner; the Ray Davies of legend is worthy of a rousing telling of his tale, but he paints himself as a rather dull chap here. And what energy and creativity he does muster is mostly for the parallel fantasy story, told from the perspective of a reporter, of octagenarian Ray still shaking his fist at the corporate suits. It's an interesting experiment overall, but considering this life story has all the elements to be fascinating, it's a disappointment that in the end, X-Ray doesn't grab the reader by the throat."
4,Better than usual for a rock book.,"Ray davies i sevidently a better than average storyteller and riter when it comes to rock related literature. A good, nostalgic look at the British Invasion scene and often funny."
1,"good songs, bad book","I have been a Kinks fan for decades. Ray Davies is a wonderful songwriter -- God bless him. This is also one of the WORST books I have ever read. Self-pitying, self-indulgent ... awful. A monstrous ego must be necessary for success in the vicious world of pop music, but it shouldn't be shown in public. Buy a few Kinks CD's and enjoy yourself, or buy this book and suffer."
2,Add 2 stars if you're a Kinks fan,"Kinks fans will love this. But I would have preferred to hear Ray's account of the Kinks' history without the Orwellian structure in which an older Ray recounts the tales to a younger Ray. Also, unlike Dave Davies's ""Kink"", this book stops short of telling the whole history . . . as though the Kinks ended sometime in the early 1970s. We never get to hear Ray's account of his relationship with Chrissie Hynde, his battles with Dave, and so much more. This book begs for a sequel which is more straightforward and tells the whole story rather than hiding behind a fictional framework."
4,An educational experience; it only finished too soon.,"Fantastic! I managed to be reading this history while I was travelling around England. It was an educational experience to be reading of Ray's youthful adventures while sitting on a parkbench in Hamstead Heath. I searched out the many clubs and pubs that hosted Ray's early encounters with the Beatles, the Stones, and the Who. I lunched in High Gate and wandered over Muswell Hill, all the while thinking about the Kinks early adventures and travels. The book is a great reading of the way Ray remembers his past. It may not be accurate, but it fulfills the romantic beliefs of any fan."
4,Aramaic Version of the Bible,"I think that this book is a great book if you are interested in the original writings/teachings of Jesus. I am 15 years old, and I looked at this book after searching for about 6 months for it. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY AND ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE!"
5,Pefect for Jello Shots!,"These are very tiny cookie cutters, and they were adorable for ghost jello shots. I also used them to cut out the middle of sliced apples for a more festive, healthy snack. They all really made an impact!"
2,Really really small!!!,Maybe I should have read the description closer but I have never seen cookie cutters this small...maybe an inch or 2?
3,Not for the true beginner,"I bought this book in preparation for a trip to Russia. Years ago I studied Russian in high school and college. As a result, I was able to get into this program fairly easily. However, I would not recommend it to someone with no Russian experience -- it requires that you immediately start reading Russian sentences, and given that the language uses a totally different alphabet, that to me is an unreasonable jump.My other comment is that the type is quite small and so those unfamiliar Russian letters are a bit more difficult to decipher than they could be."
1,Didn't help me much.,"I got this book to learn Russian, but it just throws you into what I feel is advance Russian. The CD also doesn't seem to help much either. I did learn a bit about the Russian alphabet, but other then that I didn't learn much."
2,lukewarm,"This book is accompanied by a CD with a voice recording of an Englishman speaking Russian rather than of an American speaking Russian. The speaker's vowel pronunciation is based on the English way of pronouncing vowels and can be clearly distinguished on the CD. For instance, when the speaker says a certain Russian sound is the same as the ""a"" sound in ""father"" that is not helpful to Americans who pronounce the ""a"" in ""father"" quite differently! Many other such examples are found in this CD. A recording made by an American would be more helpful to Americans."
1,"CD is okay, book can be thrown away",The cd is okay but the book is horrible if you are someone who has no experience with the Russian language.Initially the book teaches you the Russian alphabet and then right after that it starts translating English words and phrases into Russian words (with no information as to how to pronounce the words).
3,"Good book, but recordings are WAY too slow","I speak fluent Russian as my first language, and I can honestly say that this is a pretty good guide to learning Russian. My only complaint is that the spoken Russian on the recordings is WAY TOO SLOW! Russian is not spoken quickly like Spanish or Italian, but it is nevertheless spoken more briskly than English. The recordings overpronounce everything and speak almost painfully slow to a native ear. It's good at first for when you first start to learn, but I've spoken with people who have finished the course and speak very slowly. When I ask them why, they say that it's the way they speak on the CDs. But even though, the book is a very indepth guide to one of the most beautiful languages and has the complete beginner speaking within a couple of pages!"
4,Language learning made easy,"Although it's early days for me as a student of Russian language, I am seeing immediate results with this book. Within the first few lessons conversational Russian is introduced for scenarios that would aid the casual traveller. A quick glance at further lessons reveals much more in depth conversations. The CD is very helpful for listening to spoken Russian, to help pick up the finer points of pronunciation.I have previously used the 'Teach Yourself' series for Turkish language study, and found it very helpful when I travelled through Turkey - it gave me many opportunities to meet and stay with locals I would otherwise not have been able to communicate with.I expect to get similar results from this book.I am very happy with this purchase."
5,uncanny,"Despite a scene or two that could have been trimmed down - or even excised - this has to be one of the best adaptations of a book I've ever seen. Marc Senter's portrayal of Ray Pye is damn near a miracle...if you've read the book, you'll know what I mean. On it's own merits even, it's an amazing performance. Loved the book, loved the movie."
2,No Sense,"I just watched this movie last night and it was not good at all. It was interesting at first, but it kept losing my interest. There were people in the movie that had nothing to do with the movie which made no sense. The ending sucked really bad it was just crazy. The Girl Next Door was better because you could follow the story line, this one I was lost at times. The book was way better than the movie."
1,Believe i received the wrong item,"The blu-ray i purchased 'The Lost' said there was to be a commentary, audio review, etc. there isnt anything on this disc. it was a waist of 11$. There isnt even a menu screen. i would like to know if i received the wrong item."
4,Brilliant,This is quite simply an amazing film. This may be the closest I've ever been to almost awarding 5 stars.
3,Pseudoscience,"Gods from Outer Space discusses, among other things, the spheres of Costa Rica, the statues on Easter Island, Vimana (flying machines) in ancient Vedic literature, and the Temple of Inscriptions at Palenque.Overall it's a good review of ancient mysteries-- which you might learn a thing or two from. But von Daniken has little evidence to support his extraterrestrial hypothesis."
5,Major league comfort!!,"Soft and gushee. I purchased this for my aging cat, BoBo. I washed this bed weekly, due to Bo's incontinence. My only criticism is that the surface fabric became stuck together, which led to decreased softness, but the plushness remained. It was perfect for Bo; I purchased one for my fathers aging cat Teddy - it's just way comfy for aging bones. I'd like to find one in my size..."
5,"Good quality, soft dog bed","Exactly what I was looking for: a high quality, well-constructed, washable bed that provides a decent soft cushion (1.5 inches)."
5,Great Pet Product!,This is a great product - my cats love it and all take turns sleeping on it especially when the fireplace is lit. I think I am going to have to buy more :)
5,Angela's Ashes Part 2,"If you loved Angela's Ashes and didn't want it to end, there is good news. 'Tis is a continuum of life in Limerick to persuing the American dream. Although, all that glitters is not gold for Frank McCourt in America, he carrys on with the same self depricating humor of Angela's Ashes. 'Tis is not quite as dark as Angela's Ashes, but it is as interesting and funny. I still get the feeling I'm on a wild adventure through Frank McCourt's life."
1,Not worth the pricce or time,"As a sequel to Angela's Ashes I assumed it would be in a believable narrative. Unfortunately, it seemed more fiction , than fact. The price for this book is way out of line compared with most of your offerrings."
4,"great, but good in comparison",This book was great and was definitely more light-hearted than Angela's Ashes. You don't need to have read his first book (Angela's Ashes) to enjoy this part of his memoir; in fact reading the first book made me enjoy this one less simply because there was just no way for it to compare to the first.
4,Tis,"After Angela's Ashes, I had to find out how Mr McCourt advanced in lifeafter a very neglected childhood.From an Irish background, myself, I never knew the poverty anddrinking effect on families. This was an eye opener."
5,Disappointed? No Way!,"I am amazed that some other customers have called Tis disappointing! Mr. McCourt's witty, hilarious observations of New York, American life, his family, the military, teaching, and (best of all) himself are priceless. What others seem to perceive as whining is all part of a refreshingly irreverant self portrait. This guy deserves a Nobel. Sign me up for his next book fast!"
3,The compelling evidence of a fatal wound,"A compelling read, for the first four-fifths of the book, but, as others have noted, ""Tis"" ultimately disappoints and saddens. Yes, what about his eyes? his teeth, the end of his first marriage, his drinking? You finally see that Frank McCourt, although he got to America, got educated, found work, and wrote a best-selling book, did not emotionally survive his terrible childhood. Inside, he is still the starving, criminally neglected child whose model for manhood is his self-deluded alcoholic father. Some hurts cannot be entirely healed. It's miraculous that he lived to tell the story, and to contribute to society through education, but, as he depicts himself in ""Tis,"" his is the story and the contribution of a child with a permanently broken heart."
2,Such a disappointment.....,"While I really loved Angela's Ashes, I could hardly wait for this rambling sequel to end. I, in fact, found myself skipping complete paragraphs to get the end of some of these chapters. I still think that Frank McCourt is a wonderful writer, I just think it's obvious that he was under the gun to get this book to the presses and I found myself wondering if these 'Tis tales may have been better left untold. I prefer to remember the Frank McCourt of Angela's Ashes."
2,I wanted to like it....,"I really tried to like this book but it was a real let down after Angela's Ashes. He spends most of the time moaning about life instead of trying to help. Sorry, but don't bother."
2,Self-Indulgent,"This book seemed completely self-indulgent and self-serving and yet Frank McCourt doesn't make himself out to be a hero. Could it be that this book is his version of Catholic confession? He was endearing in Angela's Ashes: he didn't seem to dwell on his misfortunes, he merely worked to improve his situation and he wanted to make something of himself. He seemed optimistic that he could. Once in New York, however, he becomes a pessimistic alcoholic with little direction in his life, utterly fails in his chosen profession, teaching, and seems to have trouble connecting with women as anything more than sex objects. I think Frank McCourt has lost some of his credibility with 'Tis and I can't help but wonder if he just got lucky with Angela's Ashes."
4,Very good but a little too cute in places,"This book was very interesting, told very well with rich detail, with crushing disappointments and rich humor. But the language was off-putting -- too much like the young Frank McCourt's language in Angela's Ashes. It's as if in some ways Frank grew up in New York, yet in other ways was as naive as the 7-year-old in Limerick. As if he remains incapable of understanding life's complexities as he grows up. He was disadvantaged by his childhood, of course, but he writes as if any happenstance diverging even the slightest bit from his expectations leads him to ""wonder what kind of a world we live in where..."" blah blah blah. It's an adult world! Children spend time wondering why they can't eat toffey morning, noon, and night. Adults don't. I think Frank McCourt, having found success in this type of writing, didn't adjust it for his later years. That's what's disappointing about this book."
2,Don't bother,"Impossible to get through. While there is an interesting tale to be told, I found the voice irritating, self-conscious and unsustainable. How much of a schmuck was this guy? The contempt for women is a bore. I found ""Angela's Ashes"" to be quite rewarding, but this is misery."
2,Not Angela's Ashes!,"""Tis"" is no ""Angela's Ashes"", but if you came to care about Frank McCourt and his family in ""Angela's Ashes"", it's still worth a read. The story telling just isn't as engrossing, but how could it be?What mystified me was the unanswered questions. What happened with McCourt's eye condition? How did the prettiest girl on campus fall for the poor Irish guy with the bad eyes? How could he justify his drinking after what his father's drinking did to his family? Did I miss something? The dots didn't connect for me."
4,"McCourt bares all in this gritty, entertaining memoir.","Frank McCourt's ""'Tis"" is the powerful and earthy sequel to the highly acclaimed memoir, -'Angela's Ashes', that told of his poverty stricken childhood in Limerick. The closing chapters of ""'Tis"" almost suggests that, together, they were one continuous book cleaved neatly into two.""'Tis"" is a brave and honest autobiography. McCourt is as prepared to divulge his foolish acts and times of excess in New York bars as he is to record his determination and moments of triumph. McCourt's 'warts-and-all' record may not be as endearing as that of a child, but he quickly earns our sympathy, endures our frustration with him, and ultimately deserves our admiration.""'Tis"" is not only a very poigniant, engaging tale but it also encourages us to take a closer look at our own lives. Who knows, perhaps this will encourage one of us readers to pen a multi-million selling memoir?"
3,Amusing,"Although I got a bit tired of Frank McCourt's naive act, I did enjoy reading this book. Many times I felt glad that I wasn't married to such an immature, childish, irresponsible alcoholic; I felt impatient for him to grow up. But humor kept it amusing enough, especially the retelling of his first day teaching at a Staten Island high school. Being a teacher, I found this story to be hilarious. I couldn't help feeling throughout, though, that if it hadn't been for the connections of his brother Malachy, that even ""Angela's Ashes"" might not have been published.To my mind much better Irish authors are not as appreciated as McCourt, such as Roddy Doyle whose ""Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha"" has the same kind of poignancy as ""Angela's Ashes"" and Edna O'Brien's whose ""Country Girls' Trilogy"" is unforgettable."
2,"+- 25% good, 25% mediocre, while 50% is filler.","I was really looking forward to this book after reading ""Angela's Ashes"", but was very disappointed in ""Tis"". After the umpteenth time of telling us about his bad teeth - his weeping eyes (which had already been well covered in the previous book). The self deprication soon became VERY boring. Unfortunately, it seemed McCord was filling pages to write a quick book. My wife is from Ireland, and I thought I might be missing something in the culture and type of writing, but when she finished, her comments almost mirrored my own. The first and last parts of the book are quite good, and there is a great story here, but Mr. McCord missed it while he is the one who lived it."
1,"WTF happened, Frank?","I am curious, How did McCourt lose his fastball so quickly? This sequel falls flat, as most sequels do. I presume because most of us mortals are only blessed with a certain dose of brilliance and once that's used, tough luck. One theory--the author wrote ''Ashes'' long ago, or at least kept a journal so his remembrances were fresh. When the first book took off, he was forced to write the next installment and he was working from faded memory and writing through too many years' worth of cynicism. The lack of humor in the sequel was glaring, and that was the biggest letdown to me. ''Ashes'' was a revelation and ''Tis'' was a slap in the face. Sorry to be so hard on the author, but my expectations were dashed."
2,What a disappointment!,"As an avid fan of Angela's Ashes, I picked up 'Tis with great anticipation. I read the first two thirds of the book with interest but then McCourt began to irritate me. I found I had no reason to stay engaged. He obviously learned nothing from his father - Frankie drinks excessively too. He marries because he is obsessed with his girlfriend's looks, not because he likes her. He may be a terrific teacher, but his experiences at McKee don't indicate it. The anecdotes became repetitive - too much to drink, hangover, bad day at school, bad night at home. I skimmed the last third of the book and was incredibly disappointed that this wasn't a repeat performance."
1,Frank McCourt 'Tis NOT a Happy Man,"McCourt leaves a miserable life in Ireland and has every opportunity and advantage in America. He spends most of his time complaining. He can't pay his electric bill, but he can patronize every bar in New York. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Of his students, he says, ""Still whining, still complaining, when there are millions around the world who'd offer fingers and toes to be in your seats - neatly clothed, well fed, with the world by the balls."" Practice what you preach, Frank. When I read Angela's Ashes, I wanted to shake Angela until her teeth rattled. I feel exactly the same about you, McCourt. Grow up and take responsibility for the pain your own alcoholism caused your wife and family."
2,The unabridged Frank McCourt,"My, but he can go on...and on. While the basic follow-up story to the wonderful Angela's Ashes was moderately interesting, I could have done without the endless repetition of phrases throughout the book. Perhaps if I had read the words rather than hearing them in the author's own whine, the text would have been easier to take. I found McCourt's lists of complaints--supposedly from his students, his wife and from Angela herself nearly impossible to listen to. If I hadn't spent so much money on it and if I didn't spend so much time in my car, I'd have abandonned it. In fact, I did skip one whole side of a tape and when I realized it, I decided I was better off."
2,An annoying and pathetic sequel to Angela's Ashes,"There are very few books that I wish I never bothered to pick up and read, but this is one of them! Frank McCourt wrote a beautifully insightful and humorous book, and then ruined the warm fuzzy feelings with his sequel. Rather than feeling empathetic towards the characters described in Tis: A Memoir, I felt pity and a certain amount of contempt. In this respect the author does succeed in evoking an emotional response from his readers, but I'm certain it is not the intended one. This is the story of a young struggling man, fresh off the boat from Ireland. He whines and complains and lets us know ad nauseum how unfair it all is. While his mother is treated with respect and care, his wife (neighbors, co-workers, students)suffer abuse. The style maybe the same as in Angela's Ashes, but with none of the humour and depth of human spirit."
3,Dissapointing but with a few gems,"I felt that he was trying to gain sympathy for his situation unlike the frankness of Angelas Ashes. I was dissapointed with this sequal. He was brave to tell the truth of his situation, however he must have cringed upon reflection of his early life. He does use humor throughout the book and that makes it more bearable to read. I felt like slapping him rather than giving him a hug at the end of this second book. He does tell the truth, to his credit, and doesn't candy coat anything, a continuation of the first book in the context of style. Would recommend this to an older audience, because of the content matter."
2,so-so,"In this book, McCourt describes going from one bad job and disgusting apartment to another, seemingly ad infinitum, yet I never understood the point of it all. A disappointing follow-up to the witty Angela's Ashes. It's one saving grace, I think, is to remind readers not to take for granted the advantages we have been given and the luxuries to which we are accustomed."
1,Save your money & get this one from the library.,"The magic of Angela's Ashes was sullied with this ordinary tale of a lost man who drinks too much, stumbles into careers & women. In Angela's Ashes we feel the pain & anger of Frankie, his mother &siblings. Now their stories wander back to the USA & are NO different than any immigrants with or without the big chips on their shoulders.Mr. McCourt do us a favor & tell us no more of your family. Write fiction from now on."
1,not as good as Angela's Ashes,Tis is not nearly as good as Frank McCorts other work. I it sometimes talks about when he was a kid. But for the most part is not as good.
2,A washout!,"I've been terribly disappointed with""'tis"" This man presumably is telling the truth in writing about all his failings as a husband and proves to be very much his fathers son in his weakness for the drink.I wonder if he ever had his bad teeth and crusty eyes fixed? Yuk!!!"
1,What a major disappointment,"Don't read this book. Just read ANGELA'S ASHES (his first memoir). Don't see the movie (ANGELA'S ASHES), as it sucked. This follow up memoir destroys any likeability that I had for the author. It's just a shame to have followed up like McCourt did here. A crumby book that doesn't deserve a place on your bookshelf. Trust me.........read ANGELE'S ASHES.........don't waste your time here."
3,A book of chronological misconceptions,"Being brought up in London during the depression, and then the blitz makes me appreciate Franks horrible childhood,so well orchestrated in Angelas ashes. However my sympathy ended with ""Ti's"". Frank, if you ever read this, I know where you'r coming from. I also emigrated to this Country for similar reasons. Your book takes the reader on a journey that was traversed by many thousands of others, it therefore is not unique, niether is it captivating as was ""Angelas Ashes"", however you made it despite great adversity. My heartfelt congratulations. I did enjoy both books, honest."
3,"A mere shadow of ""Angela's Ashes""","I read 'tis to find out what happened to Frank in America, and for that reason I'm glad I did take time to read it. But I found myself not wanting to pick it up to continue. It seemed boring, slow and uninteresting."
2,Snow White became Chuky,"If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever.What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore."
5,Intensly moving you through a whole gambit of emotion.,"Every once in a while you come across a writer who delivers all the ranges of human emotion. Frank McCourt does accomplish this feat in the most inspiring way with his story of growing up against all odds. How he handles the big cruel world will open your eyes to the injustice that was dumped on him but that does not keep him down. He speaks volumes with his expression, ""I was a nine-year old thirty-three year old""! Who has never felt that way while relating to your own parent? My only regret is that I finished the book too fast and I feel like I lost my friend. Wish there was a part three to look forward to."
3,Abridged version a little thin ?,"While I throughly enjoyed the weaving of this tale by the author, Frank McCourt, I, like other readers, left with many questions unanswered. Overall, however, this audio version provided six hours of entertainment on an otherwise boring commute to and from work and often evoked both spontaneous laughter and heartfelt sadness.McCourt's story is surely shared by the countless numbers of immigrant sons and daughters of this country who came here in search of a better life. Through his work, we are reminded that we all share similar experiences, regardless of race, creed, color or national origin and that the grass is the same on both sides of the fence.While I have not, as of yet, read ""Angela's Ashes,"" this book has compelled me to do so. For those wanting to listen to an entertaining read, I would recommend this version of 'Tis, but for those wanting to get the fullness of McCourt's experiences, buy the book or the unabridged set of audio tapes."
3,Not as moving as Angela's Ashes.,"""Tis"" didnot have the emotional impact of ""Angela's Ashes"". It could of just been an addentum to the first book."
2,"Definately Not ""Angela's Ashes""","While ""Tis"" is an OK book all in all, it doesn't amount to the grandeur of ""Angela's Ashes."" While in the first book, the simple and direct style of writing was nice and pleasant to read, this approach to ""Tis"" left the style dated and rather dull. It really doesn't have a theme, either, but some fascinating historical points exist such as Vietnam, North Ireland conflicts, and Sartre existentialist philosophy. This book is certainly not worthy of half the praise of the original."
3,'Tis worth reading,"This book isn't Angela's Ashes, nor should it be, but I'm disappointed that it couldn't maintain the momentum in Angela's Ashes. This book picks up where Angela left off and appropriately ends with Angela's death. The beginning of this book is filled with humor and fun scenes depicting McCourt's early days in America. Unfortunately, I found myself boring of the book about the time McCourt entered the army. Still had its humorous moments, but definitely lagging. By the time Mike became Alberta, I was counting pages to the end. This book lacked the optimism I found so endearing in Angela's Ashes, but it did give closure at the end. Taking Angela's ashes back to Ireland seemed a fitting ending to the tome. The book only vaguely glosses over what's going on with Malachy, Michael and Alphie, focuses on the hardships that are mostly McCourt's own fault. But overall, I still think the book was worth reading."
2,Boring--and unnecessary profanity from a Catholic man!,"I listened to the abridged tape on a long distance drive---I was a captive audience. I found it totally boring and anti-climatic. There was no compelling reason to continue to listen, but I was trapped in the car. The frequent use of profanity added no depth to the content and was a distraction to continued thought processes. It made me wince.The story provided good insights into the struggles of our early imigrants and the obstacles they faced. This provided an even deeper respect for my own ancestors."
2,"This book should have been named ""How I Whined Through Life""","I read Angela's Ashes and though, ok, he had a round childhood, but so did a lot of other people. Then I read this book to see if he could get a bit better, but all Frank does is whine through the entire book! I didn't even finish ready it because it irritated me so much!"
3,'Tis,"The only thing I got out of this book was why McCourt's first book was called ""Angela's Ashes""....and of course, I had already guessed.Suggest you borrow the book from your local library if you wish to read it."
3,Drinking problems.,"Although I only made it through the first half of ""Angela's Ashes"", I decided to give this book a try because the author's writing style showed such promise. When I had finished, I concluded that I had just finished three quarters of a treatise on the evils of alcohol, especially as it relates to Irish men. Being half Irish myself, I didn't need the author to remind me of the irresponsible behavior that drink can bring; I've lived it, first-hand and second-hand. More useful would have been some discussion of the techniques that some people have used to solve or lessen the problem."
2,a disapointment compared to Angela's Ashes,"The prose is nowhere near as beautiful as Angela's Ashes, the story nowhere near as compelling. The characters are less interesting and the wry irish humor is evident less and it seems the very irishosity (as i like to call it) is gone. Being Irish, from Staten Island and spending large amounts of my time in Manhattan let me say that this book is also filled with inaccuracies (though one of these inaccuracies lead to one of the few humorous episode with the shoeshine man who does not have a brother who reapirs shoes) as well as being very repetitive. It's also far less anecdotal than Angela's Ashes and quite frankly far less interesting. The 2 stars are there because I know McCourt is capable of 5 star work (as evidenced by Angela's Ashes. Every time I see McCourt on a TV appearance or his comments they seem remarkably insightful and brilliant. The question I'm left to wonder after reading this book is ""What Happened?"""
1,Skip it.,"The first few pages looked promising, specially with the thing with the priest. Otherwise, prepare yourself for some sleeping time; I couldn't get the rest of it. I really enjoyed Angela's Ashes and was really looking forward to this book. What a dissapointment, specially after having paid full price for it at the store."
1,'Tis,"Having fallen in love with Frnak McCourt's literary genuis after reading ""Angela's Ashes"", I looked forward to reading ""'Tis"". A friend of mine had bought the book and loaned it to me.I was really enjoying it until I reached page 33...where it all just went berserk!! Page numbers, chapters, all out of sequence and NO WAY to rectify it to even make it readable. Here's how the pages go: page 33(supposedly END of chapter 4) then on the back of page 33 begins 42 (and the beginning of chapter 7)!! the next page is 35,and on the back of THAT page is 38...AND the beginning of chapter 6!!! And on and on it goes...and there is no way to make sense of it, nor to READ it.What a disappointment...and what a disservice to a wonderful author!!And SHAME on Simon and Schuster!!!! And WHAT A RIP-OFF!!!"
3,Tis: not,The first half of this book was great. The second half was so dissapointing. We all have one great story to tell. He had his.
3,A disappointing sequel,"I loved ""Anglela's Ashes"" and could hardly wait for ""Tis."" But I got the feeling that Mr. McCourt was pressured either by his fans or his publisher to write a sequel. 'Twas a disappointment.The first half contained more than I needed or wanted to know about his sexual awakening and exploits and the ending was incomplete. The descriptions of his days as a teacher, however, were wonderful. His writing style is the same simple narrative we loved in his first book."
5,"Captivating,..McCourt's transparency is a page turner...","I can't help but wonder why more bio's are not filled with such honesty. If you have ever missed the opportunity to reflect deeply on your own child-hood, Frank McCourt's book will make you determined to remember."
4,A better read than most recent top ten books.,"""Tis"" is a good, well-written book by an author who can transport you into his world with his lyrical prose and open, honest feelings. I have to admit, however, that this sequel left me a little angry with Frank McCourt. ""Angela's Ashes"" was the incredibly sad story of a little boy facing unbelievable odds who scratches his way through until he has the passage to America to start a new life. The little boy in Angela's Ashes has no control over what is happening to him--but the grown man in ""Tis"" chooses to not use control. How could this son of an alcoholic drink so much? He whines about his bad eyes and his teeth but never during the whole book does he try to get them fixed. Don't they have clinics for indigents in New York? Couldn't he have spent money on his eyes and teeth instead of booze?And why was he so mean to his mother?"
3,I would have read it even if all the reviews were terrible.,"While Angela's Ashes was a gripping and heart wrenching read, 'Tis simply managed to tie up some loose ends. After the experience of Angela's Ashes and learning so much about Frank's life, it's impossible to imagine not reading this book. However, one shouldn't expect the same level of intensity."
4,Do not expect another Angela's Ashes,"Tis takes up where Angela's Ashes left off, with wide-eyed young Irishman McCourt's arrival in America. The brogue is intact, the sense of wonder and amazement is intact, but a bit of the gloss has been rubbed off the genie's bottle in this sequel. Tis follows McCourt's progress through a series of jobs, chronicles his magical admission to NYU (without a high school transcript), and his the inauspicious beginning of his long and successful teaching career, as well as the ups and downs of romance and immigrant live in New York.It's good, but it's not stellar."
5,Give credit where credit is due !,"Okay so its not as good as Angela's Ashes but it was never going to be. McCourt had all his life to write ""AA s"" and only one year to write Tis and i think he has done an amazing job. It is a memoir after all and i think people need to keep that in mind before they slam it. McCourt has had a very tough life and he deserves all the praise and accolades at this late stage in the game.He is the working class hero.There is way too many begrudgers who are jealous of his success. I love Tis and have read and re-read it and i can honestly say it is my 2th favourite book of all time and i average a book a week. The first is still of corse Angelas Ashes"
4,Great stories!,"I liked this book, and was surprised that I did. I had heard from several people that it wasn't as good as Angela's Ashes, and I found that to be true. However, it was a lot less depressing, and for that, it deserves some praise.McCourt has so many great stories - and you just know that the ones in the book are just from the top of his head, and that there are plenty more where they came from. It was also very nice to see that the family was able to escape the misery that was evident from the first book.Overall, a good book. I would definitely recommend it, although not the abridged audio version, which was the format I found first. I later found a printed version to compare it to.A few things are left out that should have been kept in - nothing too crucial, but what are a few extra minutes here and there? I will never understand why companies release audiobooks without printing that they are abridged versions, but that's a whole other subject."
3,"We Find Out The Meaning of ""Angela's Ashes""","The sequel to Angela's Ashes, the story resumes upon young McCourt's return to America. McCourt's masterful narrative style remains intact, as he takes the reader along an intimate journey through the trials of his adult life. It took a lot of guts to shine such a candid light on himself--exposing thoughts and feelings most of us would not dare reveal. I was left thinking if it was the story I did not like, or McCourt mimicking the foolish ways of his father, constantly pulling defeat from the jaws of opportunity."
2,Blah Blah Blah,"I loved Angela's Ashes and looked forward to reading this book, but found it very disappointing. There are definately some interesting and poignant moments, but more often it is a self-indulgent ramble about a seemingly ordinary life in America. It was a challange to finish the book and my time could have been better spent writing my own memoirs since they are way more compelling than Franks's!"
4,'Tis doesn't spoil A.A.!,"Although I was a little skeptical at points, Frank McCourt manages to come through. He ties Angela's Ashes to 'Tis in an insanely intelligent fashion, and it is a definite must-read. Not as good as the first, but still worth it!"
3,A story of bitterness and resentment,"Angela's Ashes was wonderful-- I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, the same style did not really work with this book which deals with an adult's perspective. This book reads as a whining downer! It lacked the brave humor of the previous one, and increasingly projected the bitterness and resentment that McCourt must feel in carrying the burden of being Irish. Hopefully 'Tis was cathartic for the author and he will produce future work in the wonderfully expressive and humorous manner of Angela's Ashes. Looking forward to future work by this very talented writer."
2,Major diasappointment,"I loved Angela's Ashes and couldn't wait to read the sequel. What a disappointment! I had to force myself to finish this book. His life in America wasn't very satisfying or fulfilling in any way. He seemed to get nothing out of teaching and his marriage failed due to his own lack of effort. He never reached self understanding which you tend to expect from an author writing a two part memoir. I was amazed that he described without embarrassment the shabby way his family dealt with his mother's funeral. My advice, Reread Angela's Ashes. You will have great sympathy for the child but less and less for the man."
3,Not the best it could have been,"I read 'Tis before Angela's Ashes, and I don't know if that made a difference or not. All I know is that 'Tis seems to go on and on forever. A little advice- read up until the part where he meets a girl named Alberta (nicknamed Bob). Then skip to the last three or four chapters of the book. The middle is awful, and drags on forever. I felt like screaming, ""Dammit, take charge of those kids!"" I am shy myself, but would have never just sat around while a bunch of born-to-be-losers ruined their lives. Also, just wondering, why doesn't Mr. McCourt use quotes. He's teaching English class, and yet he refrains from using one of the easiest to learn grammerical marks. Also, what is that dreaded eye disease, and does he ever go to a dentist? All in all, don't buy the book, borrow it. ~Nishana"
3,Tis Really a Biography,"I loved Angela's Ashes. Tis is not written in the same style. McCourt showed us how he felt, showed us how he lived, and showed us how he suffered. In Tis, McCourt tells us how he felt, lived, and suffered. This makes it much less powerful and interesting. It reads more like a biography than a memoir because so many incidents are reported in the book. In Angela's Ashes incidents were remembered and the reader felt as if he or she was getting inside of McCourt's head. Tis seldom if ever allows the reader to feel what McCourt was feeling. Instead we are told exactly what it was. I hope that Frank McCourt writes more in the future. He is very talented and would probably be able to create a wonderful fictional world. As a biographer he is also talented, but his real skill is in memoir, which Tis isn't."
4,Glad I read the book although it was depressing.,"Frank McCourt has a way of drawing you into his world to the point at which I often felt as depressed as the author! However, there was enough humor in it to keep it balanced and not too self-pitying. I don't think I will ever cherish a book as much as I did Angela's Ashes, but Tis was still a great read and I highly recommend it."
2,Enough already . . .,"You genuinely feel sorry for Frank McCourt in 'Angela's Ashes' because much of what happens to him is beyond his control. With 'Tis, by the time I got to the end of the book I was so sick and tired of his complaining I didn't care what happened to him. I think this is a story that didn't need to be told."
3,'Tis a Letdown after Angela's Ashes,"I felt like McCourt was trying to fill the pages, after his success with Angela's Ashes, he knew he had to try to make it as good; but, he didn;t come close. It was too obvious that he was trying to make a story out of nothing, and he kept repeating himself. Most disappointing of all, was after all the repetition, he finished the book in 1985 - I'm sure to ensure that he can write another book. ""Angela's Ashes"" was very good, I think because he didn't know how famous it would make him. But now, his experiences sound like anyone else's; and I don't think I would like him teaching my child."
2,This sequel ain't equal...,"...to Angela's Ashes. Like others, I loved Angela's Ashes but was very disappointed with this sequel. He needed a Maxwell Perkins of an editor on this one. It could and should have been half as long. In AA McCourt's language was lively and colorful and his story engrossing. In 'Tis the language was dull and repetitive and the poor me theme was tiresome. I expected better."
3,Angela's Ashes was a hard act to follow...,"I found that the innocent, breathless (no commas) style that made Angela's Ashe's so heartbreaking was unapealing in Tis, because now it seems that he's still thinking like a child in a man's body. Also he's quite self-centered. His first book was about triumphing over amazing adversity; in this one, he just seems to whine an awful lot. Frank you were by no means the only poor NYU student, not even close, and you are not the only person who worked their way up by cleaning up after people. But it was a good read. I wish there was more focus on his relationship with his brothers, though."
4,McCourt shines!,"The beginning of this book was perhaps a little laborious. It just didn't flow as well as Angela's Ashes did. This is not to say, however, that the book stunk. Far from it. Only the first few pages were hard to read through. By the end of the first chapter McCourt had found his zone and never looked back! The book was as well written as Angela's Ashes but given that the circumstances were not as bleak as Limmerick, Ireland it wasn't as moving. Still, I found the book deeply interesting and wholly wonderful. If Frank McCourt DOESN'T publish another book, whether that be fiction or (somehow) another memoir, I will be severely dissappointed."
3,OK but not great,"Nowhere near the caliber of Angela's Ashes. There are some worthwhile portions of this book. The first 100 pages are very funny. McCourt's depiction of military life is hysterical. And the last 30 pages are poignant and beautifully written. But, it's too little too late. Everything in between is, I'm sorry to say, boring. If you loved Angela's Ashes (who didn't?), this will be a let-down."
2,We all live in hope,"Yes, we do all live in hope, unfortunately, I was disappointed with the result of Tis.Angela's Ashes was my first experience with Irish culture and I was entranced by Frank's story.Unfortunatley, the ramblings and constant whining in Tis was mediocre.Is it no wonder that the early years in Limerick seem much more gay than those spent in NY (where Frank was desperate to live - but ended up always the outsider)Wake up buddy - we are ALL outsiders"
3,Carece de la emoción de Angela,"Mc Court me impresionó con sus voces de niño, con su franqueza y su corage para sobrevivir.Tis, al ser ya el hombre el que habla me ha gustado menos.Me impresiona lo bien que relata la insatisfacción de su madre, su deseo de acercarse a ella sin conseguirlo, su consciencia de no poderla querer más. Me gusta como se enfrenta a las clases de literatura con aquellos chicos desmotivados.Es sincero cuando relata sus correrias por los bares. No se cómo se casa con alguien tan distinto a él, ni porque se queja de la universidad cuando pudo llegar a ella sin bachiller, eso fue una gran suerte, no parece feliz con lo que consigue. Su estilo irónico me gusta."
4,Not quite as good... But still wonderful...,"Another chapter in the life of Frank McCourt, 'Tis is intriguing, though not quite as succesful as its predecessor. While the events in McCourt's life are still amazing, and wonderully told, the story isn't as complete as in Angela's Ashes. While the tale isn't told in the same fantastic manner, if you enjoyed Angela's Ashes then you will find interest in 'Tis. I read 'Tis much more quickly than Angela's Ashes, although, I think it is merely because I wasn't as intrigued. In Angela's Ashes, the writing as well as the events in Frank's life kept me engrossed in every event. However, in 'Tis, I was more concerned with the story than the writing itself. 'Tis is still an excellent novel.I would recommend reading this book, but with the realisation that Angela's Ashes was hard to top."
4,Will Make You Appreciate Your Life,"McCourts tale of his life as a poor immigrant, alone and struggling, will make many of us appreciate our lives....as well as what our ancestors had to go through. An excellent book, although, I would have liked to have known more about how he became an author and go where he is today. A must buy for anyone with an Irish heritage!"
2,"A fast start ,but a loser by the finish.","McCourt's sequel to Angela's Ashes is interesting at first, but rambles from the middle on. His descriptions of early jobs in New York and his tour in the Army in Germany are well told. The difficulty in starting and actually finishing college with no high school diploma is also well documented. Unfortunately, once he gets his degree and starts teaching the tale becomes rambling and at times downright boring. I found myself speed reading till the end of the book finally came. Like movie sequels nothing beats the first effort."
3,'Tis Good.,"This is not Angela's Ashes. It would be impossible to top that. It is, however, a good book that is easy to read and follow. You care about Frank because you feel as if you know him from AA. You feel sorry for him when he is awkward. Some people say he is unfairly critical of the church and of his family. Not the case. He simply recognizes that both are human and therefore not perfect. If you are looking for Angela II, don't bother, but if you want a good read, with laughs and tears,than pick it up. You won't be disappointed."
2,An unrelenting subject,"Although I loved Angela's Ashes and laughed and cried and marveled at Frank McCourt's way with words and mind pictures, I was sorely disappointed by the sequel, ""Tis.""It was so, well, unrelenting and, after a while, monotonous. I didn't want to hear the description of his sore, red eyes the 50th time he mentioned them... or for that matter, the 20th time!Where the first book's tragedies and sad stories were leavened by the truly hilarious bits, ""Tis"" had few humorous moments. The last chapters seemed to be ""dashed off"" and boring. I raced through them to the end of the book.I will approach his next book with a jaundiced eye, I'm sorry to say."
2,Tis No Angela's Ashes,"When I read ANGELA'S ASHES I was stunned by the humanity of the story. I hadn't even finished it and I was recommending it to friends and buying copies to give to people. Naturally I couldn't wait to read TIS. Well I finished TIS last night and what a let down. Mr. McCourt shares his father's problem with alcohol and like his father he can't see it. His idea of Irish social drinking isn't funny and his antics and his friends antics under the influence are sad not humorous. After the success of ANGELA'S ASHES I saw and heard many interviews with Mr. McCourt and it was obvious he had an edge to him that I misstook for rightous indignation. I was wrong, Mr. McCourt is an angry alcoholic who never grew up."
1,Boring,"Maybe this just isn't my kind of book, but I just didn't care for it at all. Boring and difficult to read."
1,A very very bad book,It was obvious that this man did not have a clue about what made his first book so wonderful. It is truly sad that he did not stop there. I am truly amazed that this book got any good reviews. I do hope he will stop now.
2,Not up to par,"I thoroughly enjoyed Angela's Ashes. TIS, I did not enjoy at all. I could not wait to finish. Very repetitive with the descriptions of himself and others ad nauseum. I found it extremely boring and uninteresting. One best seller does not make another."
3,Not as good as the first,"Angela's ashes was a great book. I was holding very high expectation for the sequeal, a bit disappointed after the end. It has lost its childish humour, I guess that's understandable as it is not a memoirs of a child anymore, it is a memoir of a teenager to an adult. Nonetheless, it has a very captivating chapter; where the author was teaching para-professional part-time classes. Although the author has lost his humor as he ventured into adulthood; he has successfully instilled some warmth in replacement. Still a good read recommended to all."
3,"Good, but language offensive.","My husband and I enjoyed this book for its history of living in New York and the struggles involved in finding employment and trying to keep a marriage alive. However, the language and hugh amount of the need to continually turn to alcohol to solve problems seems to get in the way of a good story."
1,HMMM.......BAD,"This book was a great disappointment since I had set a very high standard after reading his first book. I seriously DO NOT recommend it, it's badly written and tedious. Even though the grammar in Angela's Ashes was quite poor, at least it wasn't BORING!! It's just a bunch of words printed down and bound into a book, it doesnt go directly to your head which only a truly excellent book does- it's not like in the other one when you could actually feel his pain and see his life through his own eyes- you were there."
4,Excellent,"I was warned that this book was just one long whine, but did not find it to be so. I enjoyed it almost as much as Angela's Ashes, while acknowledging that it was a very different book. As other reviewers have pointed out - it is naive to think that a man who grew up as McCourt did would be undamaged by the experience. What did they expect? Pollyanna?"
2,"This book is boring, depressing, and most of all incomplete.","If I could give this book a grade, I would give it an Incomplete. Having read and listened to interviews Mr. McCourt has given, I expected to hear more about his teaching experiences than his carousing New York, and I thought there would be some positive insight into a past filled with hardship. The book reads more like a drunkalog than a memoir.Family alcoholism is horrendous, and if Mr. McCourt is going to write any more books exposing himself and his family to public view, I would highly recommend that he take in some AA meetings. Maybe it would help him to write a more honest view of himself and his family.After the ""courage, strength, and hope"" of Angela's Ashes, I am disappointed and saddened by this latest installment."
3,very disappointing,I now know more about the McCourt family then I know about my own. Like many people have written before me Angela's Ashes was one of my most favorite books and I will never forget it. Tis I forgot while I was reading it.
3,Substitute Teacher Woes,"Tis is a considerably less captivating experience than Angela's Ashes. However, for me, there was one chapter dealing with Mr. Mc Court's first day substitute teaching that was so graphic and specific to my experience substitute teaching the past seven years in Los Angeles that I was overwhelmed. Never had I experienced in print such a vivid and accurate description of events that have occurred to me that I felt my entire nervous system respond.. What made it even more compelling was the fact that his experience occured in the late 50s and mine occurred in the middle to late 90s.The other comment I have is how disappointed I became reading about the continued adventures of the Mother and Father. Somehow, I was content with the conclusion of Angela's Ashes and I didn't really want to know any additional history about these two unfortunate people."
2,Not a patch on Angela's Ashes,"Let's face it- had it not been for the success of Angela's Ashes, McCourt would never been able to get this rambling and only occasionally interesting memoir published. Like other readers I found this self-indulgent and repetetive. By the end of it I liked McCourt (as a person and as a writer) far less than after reading Angela's Ashes. I wish I hadn't spoiled the magic by reading this volume."
3,Tis this it?,"After reading Angela's Ashes, I wanted to get the rest of the story. I felt it just led to a sequel. What I read was a rambling of every thought and person that r. MC Court met or talked to. The only thing I walked away with was his love of a drink. Although he did not leave his family penniless he did drink just like his father. I felt there was little happiness in his life. I think perhaps his daughter Maggie was the one small glimmer of something good. This story is ones life and it is hard to critique but the writing and the interest level is no where near the quality of Angela's Ashes. Angela his mother grows to be a sour woman whom most of us would not want as our Mother. I am so sad not to give this book a better review. You will wonder if another author picked up the pen to write this piece."
4,'Tis pretty good,"In many ways I enjoyed this more than Angela's Ashes. Certainly it is different to its predecessor - but that story has been told, so why would you want it repeated? In fact the grimness of AA was a series of (very evocative) repetitions.I enjoyed the story of the adult, immigrant Frank, making a life for himself in the land of his birth, from which he was as estranged as he was ireland when he first went there.As a teacher I loved the passionate journey upon which he embarked in order to succeed in his vocation/career.But the passages I liked best were about the manual work that he undertook in the ports of New York. It is quite rare these days, when much is written about the glitz and glamour of that city to read such lovely passages about comreadeship and support in working class, multiracial New York."
2,Disapointing,"Angela's Ashes deserved all the acclaim it received. 'Tis deserves the mostly bad reviews it has received. As I began to read it, I almost thought McCourt was still a child - I was surprised to realize he was 19 years old at the start of the book. His outlook on life is naive, especially when you consider the desperately hard life he came from. Could he really have thought America would be all his dreams come true! McCourt also irritatingly uses certain phrases over and over, almost to the point of making you want to put the book down. But mainly my problem with 'Tis is that it was full of misery, self-loathing, and hopelessness. It lacked the ability to see the beauty of life through all it's misery and problems. Angela's Ashes had that quality and was heart breakingly beautiful because of it - 'Tis did not."
2,Superficial.,"Mr. McCourt was my English teacher in high school. This book was a disappointment, although I had eagerly looked forward to reading it (hey, I like the guy). While he was a great teacher and a wonderful storyteller, he did have a way of exaggerating to make his point, and 'Tis is no exception. In fact, oversimplistic generalizations and a self-pitying tone not only left the impression of a very superficial work, but made me wonder about the sweeping condemnations of Church, Ireland and society in ""Angela's Ashes"". Certainly many generalizations in 'Tis are simplistic and left unexplored. On the topic of the immigrant experience, he offers nothing that's new, or insightful, or even all that interesting. It kills me to say this, but 'Tis is a loser. If you must read it, get it from the library before you decide whether to buy it."
4,As good as the first...,A rare instance when a sequel is just as well-written and enjoyable as the first book. You don't have to be Irish to relate to the humor and pathos of this memoir. I would recommend it to anyone.
5,Hilarious and Entertaining!,Excellent book. Almost every chapter had an anecdote or two. His perspective of being a teacher and his view of the old days at Stuyvesant High School was quite refreshing to me since I am a senior from Stuyvesant.
4,"Remember, it was a memoir!","Mr. McCourt's writing style has not changed, he opens his heart and expresses himself just as beautifully as in Angela's Ashes. Granted, the drama, heartache and tragedy Frank experienced as a small child was not duplicated in Tis. Thank God for that, for I do not believe Frank would have survived another ten or twenty years of the same. Remember, the book was not a novel and so Mr. McCourt shares his life as it unfolded, his attempt to redeem its every adversity, and his ability to form beauty from ashes. In a society that blames their every fault on social injustice and a poor start, I was blessed to know how Frank was victorious over a dysfunctional childhood, if there ever was one!"
4,A Nice Follow-up to Angela's Ashes,"'Tis is the tale of Frank McCourt's adulthood, and his adulthood is less depressing -- and a bit less interesting -- than his childhood. You won't find much in the way of chamber pots and consumption here, but you will find the same poetic writing that made Angela's Ashes such a wonderful book. I enjoyed Angela's Ashes more, but I'm glad to have seen how everything turned out."
2,"instead, read ""Angela's Ashes"" again",An obviously rushed sequel to Angela's Ashes that has none of the magic or joyous undertone of the first book. It reads more like a draft of a manuscript instead of a polished and poignant memoir.
3,Rather lack lustre,"While it is never fair to prejudge an author's work by his/her previous work, it is inevitable that this usually is the case. ' Angela's Ashes ', and McCourt's experiences, bubbled up with an extraordinary lack of rangour and enviable acceptance of what Life had up to that time dealt to his mother, self and siblings. ' 'Tis ' on the other hand never seemed to have much conviction about it, the author seemed to just stumble along, with his usual sense of humour, yes, but with no real sense of purpose and almost willy nilly acceptance of life in North America. Perhaps that is the real difference in the two books, his love of and for his Ireland was his greatest inspiration; this shows in his portrayal of his life in ' Tis ', which he never approaches with the same depth of emotion. His roots have never been transplanted successfully. It shows in this book. I was disappointed."
2,Tis'nt,"Having just finished Frank McCourt's sequel to the wonderful Angela's Ashes, I feel totally underwhelmed. I could not wait until this book came out and was one of the first purchasers at the local book shop....but it took me FOREVER to complete this. I usually read a book in one sitting but the dullness of this book made the normal January dreariness even more unbearable. I thought it jumped around too much and some of his sentences were three paragraphs long.While I could still hear his lyrical voice, I found myself more and more skipping whole sections, just to get to the next chapter. Upon arriving, I found that it was one of those books you just couldn't help but put down...."
1,'Tis Disappointing!,"Angela's Ashes was a great, poignant read. But this sequel tries too hard really and oh, the writerly style, though fresh and intriguing for the first few pages, kind of got annoying and unreadable--the sentences just run endlessly into each other--which might suit the comedy at times or the gruff, unaccostomed affections between men, but i had to plod thru it for the most part till i was only reading it out of duty and a stupid determination to see it thru to the end (see why run-ons get tiresome?)."
3,'Tis: A Shame,"I guess we all know that Frank McCourt's life turned out pretty well, being a published prizewinning author and all that. But if we didn't know how his story ends, we would be left with the fact that he was a pretty sorry soul who was forever not saying what he wanted to say and forever following in his father's drunken footsteps. He haplessly falls into situation after situation that are entirely joyless, and looses women and opportunities to the bottle. Angela's Ashes was lovely storytelling artfully accomplished through the eyes of a boy. But 'Tis had nothing that special going for it. 'Tis was made blurry though the ""bad eyes"" of an alcoholic. 'Twas a disappointment for this McCourt fan."
5,Thank God for Frank McCourt,"Although I have never been able to figure out the title, this is still a wonderful (and important) story of coming to America. I own the book but I actually listned to the tape version since McCourt narrated his own work. Essentially this is a follow up to Angela's Ashes in which an older Frank chronicles his return to New York City. The story os told with humor and graviety and given an earthy perspective. I was so upset that Frank McCourt left us with so little work to his credit but what he had left us is wonderful."
2,'Tis not,"You know how when you get through talking to a good teacher (or cabbie or firefighter...) you hear yourself say to them, 'you should write a book.' Thank God most of them are to busy to actually do it. This sort of thing should never be allowed to happen. Perhaps it is true that everyone has one great (ok, good) book in him. He should have just let it go at that. Every fault of the first book, the character tainted by memory and weighed by the perspectives of disaffection or warmth, the events churned through that same filter (here much less relevantly than in AA), the whole 'David Copperfield' perspective thing, is magnified and put in the way.All in all, it's much less well thought out. I'm sorry for readers who expected more, but more, I'm sorry for the kids he's not teaching, it's clear he was pretty good (and consistent) at that."
2,From pity to annoyance,"I finished it, but I was wondering why long before it was over. The first compelling tale doesn't carryover. I found myself more annoyed than anything, particularly with his drunken performance on his wedding day. Skip it and hope there isn't a third."
3,"""Tis"" good",This was a good book but not something I would care to re read.It gets predictable in a lot of ways.
4,Most Satisfied,I was more than satisfied with the speed and accuracy of my purchase. The initial purchase via the internet was easy and uncomplicated. I enjoy purchasing items in this manner.
5,A Natural Born Storyteller,The only thing more pleasurable than reading Frank McCourt's memoirs is listening to him read them! Wonderful! You will not be disappointed.
4,The best,"For those that don't know McCourt, I would suggest starting with ""Angela's Ashes"" first as this is the work he's most known for. That said, ""Tis"" is equally brilliant and moving. Lately I've been scouring Amazon for memoirs or memoir hybrids and have come across some excellent ones. Some are funny, some are disturbing, and some are brilliantly written. McCrae's ""Bark of the Dogwood"" is one, and Author Golden's ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is another. But by far, Frank McCourt is the best with ""Angela's Ashes"" and ""Tis."" I highly recommend this stellar read. But please, read ""Ashes"" first as ""Tis"" begins where the first book left off.""Tis"" is for anyone who likes to laugh, cry, and feel alive."
5,I loved this book,"This was an excellent book. It will grab your heart and pull you into the life of Frankie McCourt. His journey from Ireland to America will teach you what it is like to be a stranger in a new land. His lively descriptions of the 50's, 60's, and 70's will have you rolling on the floor laughing! And you will mourn with the family at the death of their beloved mother Angela. I highly recommed this book to anyone."
4,High expectations,"After reading Angela's Ashes one is prone to expect an equally outstanding sequel. McCourt seems to be repetative in his latter book. Angela's Ashes had the zest of ("" the terrible Irish Catholic"") childhood innocence while Tis lacks the funny recollection of ""hard times"" and focuses more on getting by as an Irish immigrant. ""Tis"" is unevitably dissappointing IF compared with Angelas Ashes because the reader doesn't want young Frankie to grow up and lose a certain youthful charm. By itself Tis is a wonderful, again slightly redundant, book which will surly make you laugh out loud."
4,He's done it again,"After Angela's Ashes, I wasn't sure if Frank McCourt would be able to match his success with this new title, 'Tis. But I was delighted to find that he did. 'Tis is a wonderful continuation of McCourt's memoir and should be read by all of his fans."
2,Not worth reading,"Publisher: ""After the success of Angela's Ashes, you could make a lot of money if you wrote another book.""McCourt: ""But I don't really have the material for another story.""Publisher: ""I didn't say it had to be a good book."""
3,Not as good as I expected,"Angela's Ashes is a masterpiece that left me wanting more. 'Tis left me wanting more, for different reasons. It is, as if, he wrote about his life and left out the interesting bits. For example, there is very little mention of his wife from whom he got divorced. The little mention given here only hints at what could have been a very compelling story. He goes on at length about his eyes (the infection), and then stops writing about them without finishing that story line. I understand that Angela's Ashes was refined from years of performing a one man show. That tried and tested approach shows in the quality of writing, but he seems less sure here. It seems all the best material was used in the first book, and all the good material in this book was used in the earlier stages. The last part of this book just seemed to drag. Overall, it is a little disappointing, although the immigrant story will be uncharted territory and therefore interesting to many readers"
2,It's No Angela's Ashes,"How could 'Tis not be a letdown after the brilliant Angela's Ashes? Still, although I enjoyed parts of 'Tis, overall I found it very disappointing and not nearly as compelling as Angela's Ashes. I think the book tried to cover too much ground and as a result, was very superficial in its treatment of most of the characters. More importantly, I grew very tired of McCourt's never-ending whining, even after he had successfully obtained his college degree and teaching job against tremendous odds. Although I admired his frank admissions regarding his excessive drinking, I was disappointed that he barely acknowledged or discussed the impact his habits surely had on his marriage and on his relationship with his daughter."
2,Disappointing sequel,"Frank McCourt seems to have lost his voice in this sequel. Where Angela's Ashes spoke compellingly of a time, a place and a life, 'Tis whines. The author has indulged himself in a pity party and invites us to buy his book and listen to him moan. I am glad I borrowed this book from the library."
2,"""Tis","Oh Mr. McCourt how could you? I was so enchanted by Angela's Ashes that the moment 'Tis hit the shelves, I had to own it and read it. I am sorry to say that I was terribly disappointed. The rich textures and vibrant images that delighted me in Angela's Ashes are missing in this confusing, angst-ridden sequel. Having savoured 'Ashes I tried hard to be patient, waiting for the old magic to appear. It was nowhere to be found. Not only did I not care about the protagonist - he bored me. If another book is in the offing, I will not rush to buy it until Frank McCourt redeems himself."
5,'Tis,"""`Tis,"" an Autobiography of Frank McCourt's life, tells how he made his way in life as a young immigrant living in New York. It also explains how he survived the chaos and mayhem without much money or family. Yet it also tells of his struggle to get through the army, how he learned to write and then explains his way through college. Written with passion and full of memory, ""`Tis"" is an outstanding book that is recommended for any young person about to go on their own in the world. Frank McCourt wrote this book as a sequel to Angela's Ashes, which is an autobiography about Frank's life as a child in Ireland. Full of twists, drama, deaths and love, ""`Tis"" should be on everyone's top ten list of books to buy. After he wrote this book he wrote ""Teacher Man"" which is a summary of his life as a teacher and how it changed his life and who he thought he was going to be. -Daniel Archuleta"
3,Engaging but not sleep-depriving,"Not having read Angela's Ashes, I ordered Tis with great anticipation using my Palm VII Amazon.com application. Frank McCourt's recounting of his college days was entertaining and brought back a few memories. The book also does an excellent job depicting the difficult times immigrants face as well as the doors that education opens. Maybe my expectations were set to high, but Tis didn't keep me up all night although it made for good reading."
3,Angela's Ashes II,"First it was Angela's Ashes, now 'Tis. What next? McCourt The Movie? I've never been a fan of sequels. They never seem to work, and 'Tis is no exception. I loved Angela's Ashes but found 'Tis to be much of a muchness without the touching freshness and tense story of its predecessor.'Tis continues the story of Frank McCourt; now living in America and trying to make a life for himself. It is still written with the same McCourt gruff (often black) humour, and at least it's honest. McCourt owns up to his mistakes. But something is missing... We never get to really learn about McCourt himself. Why does he take to drinking - a habit he so detested in his father? How does he really feel about teaching? What happened to those eyes? There are just too many unanswered questions.'Tis came across as a series of random thoughts, loosely sewn together. It left me feeling a bit empty really,"
2,A whiny narrative full of self-pity,"After enjoying Angela's Ashes, I could not wait to read 'Tis. The burning question we all had: how did the incredible Frank McCourt who survived so much adversity fare in the ""land of opportunity"". The answer, sadly, is that he held a grudge most of his life. Like most children of alcoholics Mr. McCourt remained the victim and prefereed seeing all the events in his adult life as caused by the flaws in others. He never took any responsiblity for the pain his own alcoholism caused his wife and family. The constant ""poor me"" outlook got very tiresome and boring. Grow up Mr. McCourt and learn some gratitude!"
4,'Tisn't as good as Angela's Ashes but -,"`Tis - A Memoir by Frank McCourt Schribner 1999Frank McCourt's coming of age in America is a wonderful story - full of humor, sadness and integrity. Frank brings with him his Irish roots and while he tries vainly to sink them into American soil, he never really succeeds. He remains as Irish as the day he came and tells his story with wit and verve.In Angela's Ashes the poignancy of poverty and a run-away father told in a child's voice brought me to tears as did his constant struggle to live up to a church whose stern voice incessantly called for repentance. ""`Tis"" is a different sort of book and while charming did not have the same emotional pull as""Angela's Ashes"".A good read and I would recommend it."
2,Let Down,"I loved Angela's Ashes. I felt their pain and suffering. I felt my Irish Heritage.I felt so much was left unsaid in ""Tis"". I felt as though much adieu was given to Mr. McCourt's talent, and I did not see it exhibited in the book. I was very let down. So much verbiage was repeated and was so unnecessary. I was unimpressed, but perservered.It wan't until the last paragraph in Ch. 48 that McCourt let the reader feel what he let them feel in Angela's Ashes. Finally, when he looses his Mother & Father, regardless of his feelings towards them, the reader is able to participate as they were able to in McCourt'e first book.I felt it was a very big waste of time and money ( in overdue fines. I couldn't turn it in w/o reading it's entirety.) Glad I read it, but wouldn't recommend it, if Angela's Ashes was liked. Thanks for the ear."
4,Interesting memoir,"'TIS is a much more interesting book than Angela's Ashes. The pace lends itself to a faster read, where Angela seemed to get bogged down at times. It still does not use quotations for dialogue, which is often tiresome to read, but does add to his literary style. Having read Teacher Man first, it feels like a step back, but it does give interesting insight into what makes us who we are."
1,Disappointing follow-up to Angela's Ashes,"I loved Angela's Ashes and was thrilled to learn there was a sequel. I was very disappointed in Tis, however. McCourt's writing style was charming in Angela's Ashes since he was writing from the perspective of a child but didn't translate well once he was recalling his adulthood. The book is way too long and there are many random, uninteresting anecdotes. I won't be reading McCourt's 3rd book."
3,Wonderful writing but a bit of a yawn...,"Although Angela's Ashes is my favourite book of all time, Tis was a bit of a disappointment. While it took two days to read A. A., it took me a month to read this followup memoir.McCourt is a wonderful story-teller but this part of his story was just not as interesting to this reader. I would rather have read how his mother and brothers survived when he left them there at 20 to go to America. I understand his decision...look how beautiful his life turned out to be.Frank McCourt's life will be delivered in three parts. Unfortunately, I'm only interested in parts I and III."
5,An insightful and passionate autobiography,"This second work in the story of the Irish-American Frank McCourt is nothing short of wonderful. McCourt describes his travel to America in 1949 from Limerick, Ireland, where his family moved back to after first emigrating to Brooklyn several years before. McCourt struggles with American culture, financial difficulties, and yet manages to persevere. McCourt provides the reader with incredible details from his life, including his time in the Army during the Korean War and the difficulty of teaching in New York City. His prose is funny, insightful, and creates a true picture for the reader of the life of a recent immigrant to this country and the struggle to succeed. A wonderful book that is highly recommended."
3,Okay...,"Frank McCourt used the method of repetition, as he did in Angela's Ashes. It was okay to do that when he was describing his life as a young child, but In 'Tis he's a grown man & still he tells his story like a child. If you don't have an amazing book to read, then I recommend you settle for 'Tis. Frank McCourts life is still quite interesting to read."
4,INTERESTING FOLLOW-UP,"Frank McCourt's ""Tis"" is an interesting follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Angela's Ashes."" It follows the McCourt family, and especially Frank, as they continue their lives in America. Frank's wit and his serious nature both come through in this one, although this book isn't as much a page-turner as ""Ashes"" was. In my opinion, the book would mean much more to the reader if he read ""Angela's Ashes"" first. We need that background to understand the family and to see how they have evolved into the people they are. ""Tis"" is an enjoyable read."
2,Tis Not What I Expected,"It's very difficult to review a biographical book that you didn't really enjoy because in some ways you feel as if you are being critical of the author's life. However, I really feel as if this book had no 'oomph'. There was a flatness to it that made me feel depressed everytime I picked it up. I didn't experience any connection with McCourt and his writing didn't make me care about him or any of the people in his life. If McCourt has a sense of humour, this didn't come across either - although I did notice places where he was perhaps attempting some humour, but the overall tone of book made it fall flat. It's like listening to a terribly depressed person trying to make a joke where instead of being funny, it just sounds bitter and disspirited.I would just like to have seen the story told in a more enthusiastic and interesting manner rather than the flat monotone it was delivered in."
3,"Tis misery as loves company, Frank, not bitterness","I so wanted to adore ""Tis"". I devoured ""Angela's Ashes"", and was happy to get my hands on the follow-up. But I couldn't read through more than a few pages at a time. The childlike acceptance and Irish loopiness of ""Ashes"" was completely missing here, replaced by the same bleak interchanges with the same types of ugly-hearted people. McCourt deserves every ounce of his success, because he is a very fine and vivid writer. I only wish his first years here had given him some warmer tales to tell."
5,The acclaimed Burton review,"I thought 'tis a memoir was great! It was written so well that you thought you were actually there with Frank in New York at the time! One of the reasons I liked this book was because at that time Frank was only 18 and to write like that at that age, wow! Not to mention how scared and alone he must have felt, it had to have been a hard journey! I think Frank McCourt is going to get numerous honors and awards on this book!"
3,'Tis started out so good and then....,"After thoroughly enjoying ""Angela's Ashes"", I really look forward to the sequel, 'Tis. And it started out fine, in the same tone as its predecesser: with a wry sense of humor while hopelessly optimistic for a better tomorrow. But as I read further into the book, Frank McCourt started rambling on and on, like he didn't know how to finish so he just kept typing. Where in the world was his editor? And what's worse is, as a result of this sloppy writing, the reader witnesses how he evolves into a person that brings to mind his father. Very disappointing both in a literary and personal sense. Started out so good and then, kerplunk!"
3,Essential Reading after Angela's Ashes,"Best read as a continuation of Angela's Ashes, 'Tis finds Frank McCourt making his way in America. The book's strengths lie in Frank's lucid writing ability - the poems he weaves, the description of life as a lone immigrant that are so believable. I found that the book alternated between the smooth prose that describes his life and his family's adjustment to America and a less-consistent, not as enjoyable telling of his life in the classroom and with neighbors. For this reason, the book was not as enjoyable as Angela's Ashes. Nonetheless, I'm glad I read it as I would have felt cheated if I had just read book number one as a stand alone."
4,Frank did it again!!!!,"I loved this book, not as well as Angelas Ashes, but close. Frank has a wonderful sense of humor. I laughed alot while reading about his adventures as a inner city teacher. I am waiting patiently for his next book. Frank has to be my favorite author of all time."
2,A disappointing work after a good first novel.,"Perhaps my expectations were a bit high after Angela's Ashes but this novel did not go anywhere for me. Sure, there were some amusing stories but seemed like trudgery to get through 'Tis. When I can't look forward to picking up a book at the end of a day then I know it's a boring book. Reader beware."
4,"Not as good as Angela's Ashes, but stilla great book!","""'Tis"" is a compelling memoir of an immigrant's life in midcentury America. Frank McCourt's storytelling technique kept me from putting this book down! I did feel that he sketched over a lot of his life in this book. He does not go into detail nearly as much later in the book as he did in its earlier chapters. Characters just vanish (or appear) out of left field. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed ""'Tis""."
4,Rewiew of 'Tis,"'Tis was humbling. It was hilarious and sad at the same time. It was well written, but a little confusing at times."
1,'Tis a Shame,"Major dissapointment. I enjoyed ""Angela's Ashes"" and as a second generation Irish-American believed much of what he said to be true, based on similair stories I heard from my own childhood. I also enjoyed his quick wit an humor. Tis was pathetic, what exactly did Frank McCourt contribute to society when he came to the U.S.? All he does is whine,talk about his sloppy drinking, and treat all the women in his life with total disrespect. There are so many wonderful stories of the Irish that came to the U.S. and built companies and contributed to their communities it is a shame he adds fuel to the notion that the Irish are lazy. A complete waste of time I have lost all respect for him as a writer and more important as a gentleman."
1,"""Tis"" not","Having read and enjoyed Angela's Ashes, I was very disappointed with Tis. Frank painted himself as a pathetic Irish drunk, who learned little about meaningful relationships in over 40 years. If this is really true, at least he could have made the book more interesting with less self-deprecation and at least a pretense of some purpose in life. I probably would not have finished it had I not been stuck in an airplane with little else to read!"
2,Disappointed. Reads like it was copied from a daily log.,"All the sentiment, emotion and spirit of Angela's Ashes is gone and in it's place is a tale of resentment and anger. I thought Angela's Ashes was written with a sense of pride and understanding but neither can be found in McCourt's TIS. TIS contains too much whining and complaining and not enough inspiration to be recommended. This book is depressing enough to make Oprah Winfrey's book list."
3,pretty interesting stuff,"I found Tis to be a good account of mr mccourt and the irish in the early years. I found it similar to catcher in the rye in style. I believe there will be more written, as it was ended in 1985. The ambition of the young irishman(mccourt) and his success were interesting. His ""keeping it real"" with the truths of ginmills,hangovers,lady and family ordeals had a real meaning to those of us who've lived in success and failure. It's a good sequel, but not overwhelming."
4,A Facinating Contemporary Autobiography,"After reading ""Angela's Ashes"" I asked my public library to purchase this book. I find this book much more upbeat, very human in explaining his lack of confidence. Because of how he portrayed his own character I believe a lot of us connect to how he felt and what he went through. Frank McCourt's words brought to the page what a lot of people feel one way or another, one day or another in each of our own lives."
